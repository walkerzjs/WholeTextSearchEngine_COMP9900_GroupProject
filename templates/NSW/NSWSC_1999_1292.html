<b>50212/96 PLACER (PNG) PTY LTD &amp; 3 ORS BEING THE MEMBERS OF THE PORGERA
JOINT VENTURE v DYNO NOBEL ASIA PACIFIC LIMITED (FORMERLY
DYNO WESFARMERS
LIMITED) &amp; ANOR </b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	Prior to 27 August 1975, Placer (PNG) Pty Limited (Placer) and
Mount Isa Mines Limited (Mount Isa), jointly owned certain mineral
tenements
near Porgera in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, situated approximately 220
kilometres in a westerly direction from Mount
Hagan, the principal town in the
central highlands. Lae was the nearest sizeable shipping port located
approximately 750 kilometres
to the east. 
<P>

2  	By an agreement dated 5 April 1979, Placer transferred, with the
consent of Mount Isa, 50 per cent of its interest to Consolidated
Goldfields
Australia Limited (Goldfields), following which on 31 July 1979, Placer, Mount
Isa and Goldfields entered into a joint
venture agreement "for the purpose of
providing for the future exploration and development of the ... mineral
tenements and (certain)
additional area ... by way of Joint Venture ..."(the
joint venture agreement). Placer was appointed manager, subject to the control
of the management committee, constituted by representatives of each of the
parties to the joint venture. 
<P>

3  	By clause 4 of the joint venture agreement, the management
committee was to meet in Sydney, or such other place as may be determined,
at
regular intervals. By clause 12, each party was entitled "to take in kind and
separately dispose of its share of all ores, concentrates
and refined products
produced pursuant to the terms of (that) agreement". Each party was obliged to
contribute, in proportion to
its percentage interest, to all exploration and
production expenditures, approved by the committee, within fourteen days of the
times
and in the amounts required by Placer.
<P>

4  	By an agreement of 6 December 1988, Placer's role as manager was
more precisely defined. On 12 May 1989, Placer, Highlands Gold
Properties Pty
Limited (Highlands) and RGC (Papua New Guinea) Pty Limited (Renison) entered
into a mining development contract with
the state of Papua New Guinea (the
State) by which they committed themselves to the development and operation of a
gold mine in the
area. Although not clearly stated in the evidence, I take it
that Highlands was a party to the joint venture as a subsidiary of Mount
Isa
and that Renison was a related corporation of Goldfields. Placer was a
subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc, a Canadian domiciled company,
whereas, Mount Isa
and Renison's holding companies were Australian publicly listed companies.
<P>

5  	Pursuant to agreements dated 21 March 1990 and 21 November 1990,
Mineral Resources Porgera Pty Limited (Resources), became a
party to the joint
venture and bound by the development contract with the State which had been
entered into by the joint venturers
on 12 May 1989. By those agreements,
Resources acquired a ten per cent interest in the joint venture: an interest
which was later
increased. Resources is a statutory corporation of the
State.
<P>

6  	Placer, Highland, Renison and Resources (referred to as the PJV),
are the plaintiffs in these proceedings brought in respect
of their interests
as joint venturers against Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific Limited, formerly known as
Dyno Wesfarmers Limited (each referred
to as Dyno) and Niugini Insurance
Corporation (Niugini Insurance). 
<P>

7  	The proceedings arise out of a catastrophic set of explosions
(the explosions) in an explosives facility operated in the subject
area by Dyno
on 2 August 1994 at a time when Niugini Insurance carried certain risks in
relation to the activities of the joint venturers,
the precise nature of that
cover being a matter in contention. The commencement of the period of insurance
was 1 July 1989 and was
expressed to be for a period of "estimated 39 months".
It was described as a "<u>CONTRACT WORKS INSURANCE</u>" (the policy). The
explosions killed eleven employees of Dyno and completely destroyed the
explosives facility, leaving a crater
40 metres wide and 15 metres deep. It
devastated the area and damaged property up to two kilometres away.
<P>

8  	In these proceedings, the PJV seeks recovery from Dyno of certain
material damage and business interruption losses caused by
the explosions and
maintains the proceedings against Niugini Insurance to enforce the policy as
the subject of certain endorsements
(the endorsed policy) for the benefit of
Dyno as an insured, although not a named party to the policy or the endorsed
policy. Otherwise,
the PJV has no continuing interest under the policy or the
endorsed policy, the PJV's claims thereunder having been satisfied by
agreement
with Niugini Insurance. Dyno has brought a cross claim against Niugini
Insurance under the endorsed policy in the event
that it has standing to bring
the proceedings in its own name.
<P>

9  	The PJV seeks to enforce the endorsed policy on behalf of Dyno in
respect of any liability which Dyno may have to the PJV in
respect of the
latter's material damage or business interruption claims or in respect of
material damage suffered by Dyno as a consequence
of the explosions: in the
event that Dyno's cross claim against Niugini Insurance is misconceived. 
<P>

10  	The ore which the PJV sought to exploit consisted of a deposit
of gold and silver located in what was described as "rugged,
rainforest-covered, mountainous areas at comparatively high altitude between
2,250 metres and 2,700 feet (sic) above sea level".
The deposit was located
primarily within Mount Waru Wari into which an adit had been mined at RL 2,280
metres (the level 28 adit),
I think, prior to the inception of the joint
venture agreement. 
<P>

11  	There followed diamond drilling exploratory work which led to
preliminary economic evaluations and then a feasibility study
of May 1988 (the
feasibility study) prepared under the direction of Placer Dome Technical
Services Ltd (Technical Services) for Placer
as manager of the joint venture.
The feasibility study was provided to Niugini Insurance prior to it going on
risk under the policy.
Niugini Insurance was essentially a "front" insurer,
with Munich Re-insurance Company (Munich Re) and its following market
re-insuring
Niugini Insurance's risk. Munich Re negotiated the wording and the
terms of the policy with the PJV's broker, a member of the Bowring
Group and
Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (Bowrings), whose representative was W D
Robertson (Robertson). Niugini Insurance
played no active part in the formation
of the policy agreement or in relation to the endorsements. I do not understand
any issue
to turn on that fact. The case has been conducted on the basis that
Munich Re, as re-insurer, acted also for Niugini Insurance and
Munich Re's
following market. 
<P>

12  	The feasibility study, which comprised some six volumes, was
supplied by Robertson to Munich Re, which was represented by Eckehard
Hettler
(Hettler), who, at the time Niugini Insurance went on risk, was based at the
United Kingdom branch of Munich Re in the capacity
of "Chief Engineer and
Engineering Manager underwriting all engineering classes of insurance". The
feasibility study was described
as one "for the proposed 8 000 t/d open pit and
underground, mining and metallurgical operation to be located at Porgera, Enga
Province,
Papua New Guinea". Its aim was expressed to be "to investigate and
display, in all necessary detail, the features, requirements and
economics of
the Porgera Project". The six volumes comprised Geology, Mining, Metallurgy,
General Matters, Construction and Operating
Estimates and Summary. The "total
construction cost of the project inclusive of the initial operating expenses"
was estimated to
be Kina 662,671,000. There were to be two processing streams
to accommodate a staged production from proposed underground mining
and open
pit mining described as follows:
<P>

"The 1500 t/d Section 1 concentrator will start processing underground ore in
month 16 of the construction schedule; the Section
2 concentrator will start
processing open pit ore in month 42."
<P>

13  	At the time that Niugini Insurance went on risk under the
policy, namely 1 July 1989, the construction schedule was for an
estimated
period of 39 months. The construction schedule revealed the general nature of
the proposed construction save for the reference
to "Tawisakale". There were
two plant sites, one, the Anawe and the other, the Tawisakale plant site which
was also known as the
aggregate plant.
<P>

14  	The construction cost details were included in table 6.11, being
the "<u>Construction Cost Estimate by Area</u>" in the feasibility study. In
relation to cost area 30 "Underground Mine" the underground development was
described as follows in
the feasibility study:
<P>

"Underground development will commence at the start of Year 1. The initial mine
access will be through the existing exploration
adit. A second mine access may
be provided by a decline from the surface collared adjacent to the Section 1
plantsite. Either access
can be used for truck haulage of ore. Underground mine
development has been scheduled to ensure that underground production will
achieve a rate of 550 000 t/a in Year 2.
<P>

The underground operation will utilize a vertical retreat mining method. Stopes
were laid out with dimensions approximating 15 m
x 10 to 25 m in plan and 30 m
in height. Artificial support will be used in the majority of development
openings and cable bolt support
will be utilized in crown pillars and 50% of
the stope hanging walls.
<P>

Alternate stopes will be mined and filled with hydraulic backfill when the
stope is drawn empty. Trackless equipment will be used
in both the development
and production phases."
<P>

15  	In relation to cost area 26, the feasibility study summary
contained the following description:
<P>

<u>"Mining - Open Pit </u>
<P>

Conventional open pit mining methods will be used with benches set at 10 m
intervals. Wall slopes of 45&#176; and 35&#176; were
established for competent
and incompetent rock respectively.
<P>

The open pit will be mined in three stages in order of decreasing
profitability. The first two stages will be mined at an elevated
cut-off with a
low grade fraction stockpiled for milling after the third stage is mined
out.
<P>

Conventional electrically powered rotary drills, cable shovels, and a mixed
fleet of 77 t and 154 t haulage trucks will be utilized.
A large fleet of
miscellaneous support equipment including rubber tired loaders, hydraulic
shovels, track dozers and graders will
support the mining operation."
<P>

16  	The cost estimates for the project were more particularly set
out in vol 5 of the feasibility study on a cost area basis. "Cost
area 26 -
Open Pit" identified seventeen principal cost areas within that segment which
included one described as "Constructing an
explosives plant". That cost was
further itemised in an accompanying schedule which estimated a subtotal of
1,554,076 Kina of which
1,540,000 was made up of the explosive plant itself,
the balance being mechanical and electrical costs. 
<P>

17  	Volume 2 of the feasibility study, concerned with the mining
element in the project, contained the following description:
<P>

"Blasting:
<P>

An explosives plant will be built at Porgera for the manufacture of slurries.
The cost for the plant was based on information from
a PNG explosives supplier.
The cost of building the explosive plant is estimated to be Kina 1 134 000. The
plant will be located
on the western side of the waste dumps ..."
<P>

18  	Under the policy "The Insured" was defined as follows:
<P>

"Porgera Joint Venture and/or Placer Pacific Limited and/or Renison Goldfields
Consolidated Limited and/or M.I.M Holdings Limited
and/or Placer (P.N.G.) Ltd
and/or Placer Dome Technical Services Limited and/or Associated Companies
and/or Subsidiary Companies
and/or Contractors and/or Subcontractors and/or
Suppliers on Site and/or All Other Parties Interested in the Project for their
Respective
Rights and Interests and/or Government of Papua New Guinea."
<P>

19  	I read that definition as limiting the unnamed insured to
associated or subsidiary companies, contractors, subcontractors or
suppliers
physically on the site of the project and being "Interested in the Project".
Significantly, I think the period of insurance
was stipulated to be:
<P>

"From: 1st July 1989 for the period of the project (estimated 39 months)"
<P>

20  	I think that the phrase "period of the project" refers to the
construction period of the project as identified in the context
of the
feasibility study's bar chart showing construction works for the "estimated 39
months". The property insured was defined in
the "<u>Section I - 'All
Risks'</u>" as follows:
<P>

"a) The Contract Works, including Temporary Works, Property, Temporary
Buildings and contents and all Materials and Goods used or
to be used in
connection therewith, the Property of the Insured or whilst in the Possession
of the Insured or for which the Insured
are responsible and all other things
forming part of the Project which are declared within the Sum Insured
<P>

b) Existing Adit and Nebilyer River to Porgera Access Road
<P>

c) Constructional and Mining Plant and Equipment the property of Porgera Joint
Venture or for which they are responsible, as declared"
<P>

21  	I interpret that description of "Contract Works" as, in
substance, referring to the construction works generally described
as such in
the feasibility study. However, it is clear that those construction works are
not to be equated with the property insured
as appears from the expanded
definition of that phrase in the definition section quoted above. Further, I
read the phrase "declared
within the Sum Insured" as governing "all other
things forming part of the Project" and not as referring to, for example,
"Contract
Works". However, in the case of "Constructional and Mining Plant and
Equipment", I think the phrase "as declared" applies to all
of that property.

<P>

22  	To understand the breadth of the inclusion amongst the insured
of "Suppliers on Site", it is necessary to have regard to the
definition of the
site as being:
<P>

"Porgera, and other places within Papua New Guinea used for the purposes of the
Project."
<P>

23  	"Existing Adit" should be read as a reference to the level 28
adit.
<P>

24  	In my view, there are numerous references throughout the policy
which are inappropriate to the subject construction works as
part of the
project. The wording relates to a conventional 'contractors all risks policy',
whereas this project, of which the construction
works formed part, was a mining
project undertaken by the PJV as 'owner' of the mining tenements, itself
carrying out the development
of the mine, including the construction works, for
concurrent exploitation of the resource for the benefit of the PJV during the
lifetime of the mine. 
<P>

25  	As an illustration of inappropriate wording, in that context,
reference may be made to the provision in the definition of "period
of
insurance" for a "Maintenance Period not exceeding 12 months for each contract.
Plus 28 days or any other shorter period as required
by contract from the issue
of any Practical Completion Certificate (or similar certificate) if and to the
extent required under contract".
There was no contract works in the
conventional use of that expression: there was no maintenance period or
practical completion certificate
provision applying to the PJV in its
performance of the works. Those provisions could only have application to
contracts relating
to contractors, subcontractors or suppliers on site or other
parties interested in the project within the meaning of the definition
of "The
Insured" under the policy. 
<P>

26  	Another example is in the exceptions to the <u>Section I 'All
Risks'</u> Cover of "any consequential loss or penalties for non-performance,
non-completion of or delay in the completion of the Contracts".
<P>

27  	Similarly, the provision for maintenance period cover would
appear to have no application to the PJV as distinct from any of
the unnamed
insured. The maintenance clause was in the following terms:
<P>

"In respect of any works insured hereby which are the subject of a handing over
certificate and so subject to Maintenance Liability
conditions in the contract
between Porgera Joint Venture and the contractors the indemnity by Section I of
the policy in respect
of those works shall apply to the contractors only in
respect of any loss of or damage to the works occasioned by the Insured in
the
course of any operations carried out for the purpose of complying with the
obligations of the conditions of maintenance and in
respect of loss of or
damage to the works due to a cause occurring during the construction period
prior to the commencement of the
maintenance period."
<P>

28  	It is clear from that clause that it was never intended to apply
to the PJV other than in the context of a "contract between
(the PJV) and the
contractors" and in that case, it was provided that the indemnity would "apply
to the contractors only in respect
of any loss of or damage to the works
occasioned by the Insured in the course of any operations carried out for the
purpose of complying
with the obligations of the conditions of maintenance" and
then only in respect of damage "due to a cause occurring during the
construction
period prior to the commencement of the maintenance period". It
provided no operational cover.
<P>

29  	The <u>Section I 'All Risks'</u> Cover indemnified the insured
in the following terms:
<P>

"The insurance will indemnify the Insured in respect of physical loss of or
damage to the Property Insured arising from any cause
whatsoever subject to the
exceptions and conditions hereinafter stated:"
<P>

30  	The exceptions to Section I of the policy included the
following:
<P>

"(m) tunnelling works and galleries for:
<P>

- grouting of soft rock areas and/or other additional safety measures even if
their necessity arises only during construction
<P>

- overbreak excavation in excess of the excavation profile shown in the plan
and the additional expenses resulting therefrom or
refilling of cavities
<P>

- expenses incurred for normal dewatering even if the quantities of water
originally expected are exceeded
<P>

- loss or damage due to breakdown of the dewatering system if such breakdown
could have been avoided by stand-by facilities 
<P>

- expenses incurred for additional sealing up and facilities for the normal
discharge of run-off and underground water even if the
quantities of water
originally expected are exceeded
<P>

...
<P>

o) loss of or damage to actual mining works (other than existing adit, new
drive and ventilation shaft)"
<P>

31  	Section II of the policy provided third party liability cover in
the following terms:
<P>

"INSURING CLAUSE
<P>

The Insurers will, subject to the exceptions and conditions hereinafter
mentioned:
<P>

(a) indemnify the Insured for all sums which the Insured shall become legally
liable to pay in respect of or arising out of:
<P>

(i) Bodily injury or illness (including death at any time resulting therefrom)
suffered or alleged to have been suffered by any
person or persons.
<P>

(ii) Damage to or destruction of property including the loss of use thereof
iterruption (sic), denial of access, loss of trade or
other deprivations.
<P>

happening during the Period of Insurance in connection with the project and
caused by an occurrence.
<P>

for the purpose of this Insurance the word 'occurrence' means an event
including injurious exposure to conditions, which unexpectedly
or
unintentionally results in bodily injury or property damage or any
consequential losses arising therefrom.
<P>

(b) defend in the name of and on behalf of the Insured any claim or suit
against the Insured to recover damages on account of such
bodily injuries
and/or damage to or destruction of property as aforesaid.
<P>

(c) pay in addition to the Limits of Liability expressed in the Schedule.
<P>

(i) All expenses incurred by or with the permission of Insurers for
investigation, negotiation and defence of claims and suits
<P>

(ii) All expenses incidental to the appeal from any judgement against the
Insured subject to the consent of the Insures (sic)
<P>

(iii) All expenses in connection with any other court actions or legal
proceedings arising out of an occurrence insured against
hereunder."
<P>

32  	Upon the proper construction of that clause, it would indemnify
the insured for costs and legal expenses incurred in respect
of any proceedings
"arising out of an occurrence insured against". Those proceedings would extend
to due process of law, for example,
in the form of a public enquiry into the
cause of "an occurrence insured against". 
<P>

33  	I would not regard the legal costs and expenses as limited to
those necessarily incurred. As long as those costs were reasonably
incurred,
there would be no basis for the exclusion of those costs from such an indemnity
cover. 
<P>

34  	The exceptions to Section II included the following:
<P>

"b. liability for loss of or damage to property owned by or in the care,
custody or control of the insured other than loss of or
damage to:
<P>

i) the personal possessions including vehicles and their contents of Directors,
Partners, employees or Visitors of the Insured.
<P>

ii) premises and their contents not owned, leased or rented to the Insured but
which premises are temporarily occupied by the Insured
for the purposes of the
project.
<P>

...
<P>

e. claims which are the subject of indemnity under Section 1 of this policy or
which would have been the subject of indemnity under
Section 1 but for the
application of the deductible(s) thereunder.
<P>

f. the deductible as expressed in the Schedule.
<P>

g. any amount in respect of liquidated damages fines or penalties payable by
the Insured or any sum payable by the Insured by way
of damages for breach of
contract."
<P>

35  	The "<u>CROSS LIABILITIES CLAUSE</u>" in that section of the
policy was in the following terms:
<P>

"For the purpose of the indemnity granted by this Section of the policy claims
made by any of the parties described as the Insured
against any other party so
described shall be treated as thought (sic) the party claiming was not named as
the Insured in this policy.
Insurers waive all Rights of Subrogation which they
may have or acquire against any of the said parties."
<P>

36  	That clause, in my view, has no further operation than that
which would be regarded as a condition of the policy on its proper
construction, sans the cross liabilities clause.
<P>

37  	The business interruption cover is contained in "Section III -
<u>FINANCIAL CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS</u>. The extent of the cover was provided for
in the following terms:
<P>

"The Insurers hereby agree with the Insured Party under this Section that if at
any time during the period of insurance as stated
in the Schedule to this
Section any or all of the specified items listed in the said Schedule suffer
loss or damage indemnifiable
under Section I of this Policy, (whether or not
such loss or damage exceeds the appropriate deductible) unless specifically
excluded
in this Section, thereby causing an interference in the work insured
under this Section and/or testing schedule resulting in a delay
to the
scheduled date of commencement of any phase of the insured business and/or
interruption or interference during the operational
phases the insurers shall
indemnify the Insured Party for the Interest Insured under this section,
subject to Sum Insured and waiting
period as specified in the Schedule to this
Section"
<P>

38  	In the events that happened, no claim was made under Section III
of the policy by the PJV; the business interruption being
less than the
"waiting period" specified in relation to "Operational Phases - 30 days per
occurrence". A claim for business interruption
losses is made by the PJV
against Dyno. 
<P>

39  	However, the terms of this cover, I think, are relevant to the
construction of the policy, as a whole. The period of insurance
was defined as
follows:
<P>

"The period of insurance shall be the period stated in the Schedule to this
Section terminating on the date specified in the Schedule
for the completion of
Phase III of the works or on any earlier date when contract works cover
ceases."
<P>

40  	The indemnity period was defined as follows:
<P>

"That period, not exceeding the Indemnity Period Limit stated in the Schedule
to this Section, during which the Insurers have agreed
to indemnify the Insured
for the Interest Insured under this Section; such period to start for (a)
physical loss or damage to the
works during the construction/testing periods
from the date on which, had the loss or damage not occurred the insured
business would
have commenced but at the earliest the scheduled dates of
commencement of commercial operations of Phase I, Phase II or Phase III
and
during which the results of the insured business are affected in consequence of
such loss or damage.
<P>

for (b) physical loss or damage to property insured during the operational
period, from the date of the occurrence of the physical
loss or damage and
during which the results of the Insured business are affected in consequence of
such physical loss or damage."
<P>

41  	The premium calculation for this cover was based upon the
"estimated annual gross profit acmount (sic) plus annual standing
charges for
Phase III" and the sum insured was "calculated by reference to the estimated
gross profit net of production cost for
a period of 18 months from the
scheduled date of completion of Phase III of the insured business, based on an
anticipated gold price
of 400 $/ounce ...". 
<P>

42  	The period of insurance "stated in the Schedule" was 39 months
from 1 July 1989, being the "scheduled date of completion of
Phase III", while
the indemnity period was defined in the Schedule as "18 months including
waiting period from schedule date of commencement
of commercial operation of",
respectively, Phases I, II and III namely, 1 October 1990, 1 April 1992 and 1
October 1992 or "from
the date of the occurrence for the operational phase of
Phase I or Phase II." 
<P>

43  	The three phases may be identified by reference to the
feasibility study. Phase I represents 'month 15' in the construction
schedule
which is identified as the development of the underground mine to a stage
described as: 
<P>

"INITIAL GOLD PRODUCTION FROM LEACHING PYRITE CONCENTRATE FROM 1500 T/D SECTION
ONE OF CONCENTRATOR"
<P>

44  	Phase II is the 33rd month of the construction schedule and that
represents the stage at which the oxygen plant and autoclaves
are erected and
it is described as follows:
<P>

"GOLD PRODUCTION BY LEACHING OXIDIZED RESIDUE FROM STORAGE POND AND OXIDIZED
PYRITE CONCENTRATE FROM 1500 T/D SECTION ONE OF CONCENTRATOR"
<P>

45  	The Phase III date of 1 October 1992 is month 39 in the
construction schedule and coincides with the completion of the construction
works.
<P>

46  	It is plain that Section III has application to the operational
phase of the project. I think it is also clear that in Section
I a distinction
is to be drawn between "Project" and "Contract Works". The "Project" is clearly
defined as the mining project and
is not limited in meaning to the construction
works which were estimated to be completed within "39" months of the inception
of the
policy. That has significance in identifying the insured as defined in
the policy as they extend to "Contractors ... Subcontractors
... Suppliers on
Site and/or All Other Parties Interested <u>in the Project</u>" (emphasis
added). In my view, that is consistent with the definition of the property
insured under the policy as consisting of the
specified works, property,
buildings, materials and goods and extended only to such other parts of the
project which were "declared
within the Sum Insured".
<P>

47  	In that context, I note that in the definition of "the Insured",
each was insured "for their Respective Rights and Interests
..." and,
significantly, those interests were not restricted to the construction works.
Given the definition of the insured property
and of the scope of the Section
III cover, there is no warrant for limiting the interests of the insured to the
construction works
and I consider the absence of any such express limitation as
intentional.
<P>

48  	I note further that the Section II cover indemnified the
"Insured" in respect of injury or damage to property "happening during
the
Period of Insurance <u>in connection with the project</u> ..." (emphasis
added). Similar expressions are adopted in the exceptions to the Section II
cover.
<P>

49  	The exceptions to the Section I cover, in particular, exceptions
m) and o), only have utility when the term 'Project', as used
in the definition
of the property insured, bears the meaning of the Porgera mining project.
<P>

50  	Under the general conditions of the policy there was included
the following:
<P>

"DUE CARE CLAUSE
<P>

The Insured shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or
liability.
<P>

...
<P>

PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE
<P>

The premium shown in the Schedule being provisional only shall:
<P>

(i) at the end of the Period of Insurance declare to the Insurers within a
reasonable time the Final Project Price to enable the
premium to be adjusted at
a rate not exceeding the agreed policy rate.
<P>

(ii) at each anniversary date declare to the Insurers within a reasonable
time:
<P>

(a) the estimated new replacement value of constructional and mining plant and
equipment insured hereunder at risk each quarter
<P>

(b) the estimated new replacement value of all completed roads insured
hereunder at risk each quarter
<P>

to enable the premium to be adjusted at a rate not exceeding the agreed policy
rate."
<P>

51  	In relation to the premium adjustment clause, it may be observed
that the premium was to be adjusted to the "Final Project
Price". I regard that
reference to "Project Price" to be a reference back to the sum insured in the
policy and consistent with the
definition of the property insured which
extended to specified construction works forming part of the project in
addition to such
"other things forming part of the Project which (were)
declared within the Sum Insured".
<P>

52  	There were several endorsements to the policy in the years
following its inception, not all of which call for comment. I think
the first
significant endorsement is that dated 20 December 1990 (the 1990 endorsement).
That endorsement noted the following agreement:
<P>

"Noted and agreed that :
<P>

1. The sum insured for "All Risks Section" is increased to US$770,995.000
<P>

2. The sum insured for Financial Consequential Loss is increased to

<P>

4. The final premium for Contract Works/Third Party Liability and Financial
Consequential Loss will be adjusted at expiry at rates
established for
increased sums insured and project period to be agreed Munich Re only."
<P>

53  	The next endorsement of note was that dated 16 November 1992
(the 1992 endorsement). The 1992 endorsement noted a clarification
of the
definition of "Constructional and Mining Plant and Equipment" so as to exclude
"permanent property of the Insured forming
part of the mining process plant
...". It clarified further the meaning of the term "Mine" as referring "<u>to
the actual operations</u> in respect of removing ore from the ore body, and not
to the mining machinery, whether above or below ground, necessary for the
processing
of the ore" (emphasis added). Clearly, when speaking of the mine,
the policy includes the operational nature of the project.
<P>

54  	The endorsement further noted that in respect of the Section III
cover, the schedule date of commencement of Stage 3 was 1
September 1992 "or
any later date as advised in regular status report". It was said that this
information was based upon the report
number 64 of 29 February 1992. There were
numerous such reports put into evidence. However, report 64 was not one of them
as far
as I have been able to discover.
<P>

55  	A further agreement in the endorsement was noted as follows:
<P>

"Sections I and II Cover
<P>

Additional premium/return premium in respect of early completion of
construction/early commencement of operations cover to be agreed
by
Reinsurers."
<P>

56  	A further attachment included in the endorsement was in the
following terms:
<P>

"It is hereby agreed and declared that this policy is endorsed to note the
following:-
<P>

1. The period of the project is now estimated to be 66 months plus 12 months
extended maintenance period.
<P>

2. Cover will apply <u>on an operational "all risks" basis</u> in respect of
completed stages 1, 2 and 3 until completion of stage 4.
<P>

3. The <u>Additional Premium</u> payable at 1st July, 1992 <u>in respect of the
operational</u> <u>all risk insurance</u> is US$3,156,932.
<P>

4. The fourth instalment of Premium due 1st July, 1992 (US$4,099,525) is now
payable 1st July, 1993.
<P>

5. There is an Additional Deposit Premium of US$645,000 for period 1st July,
1992 - 1st July, 1993 ..." 
<P>

(emphasis added)
<P>

57  	There was a further significant endorsement, namely that dated 8
June 1994 (the 1994 endorsement). The 1994 endorsement noted
the following
agreements:
<P>

"1. The period of the project is now estimated to be 81 months (from 1.7.89)
plus 12 months extended maintenance period, to include
works in respect of
Stage 4 (b).

<P>

(emphasis added)
<P>

58  	The evidence established that there were four stages. Stage 4
was being subdivided into Stage 4(a) and Stage 4(b). Those four
stages and the
times during which they were performed were as follows:
<P>

"59. Placer commenced Stage 1 in June 1989 and completed it in August, 1990.
This stage consisted of constructing a 1500 - 2000
tonne per day gravity
separation and pyrite flotation concentrator at the Anawe Plant Site. The Anawe
Power Station, a diesel generator
which generates approximately 12 to 18 mW of
electricity, and a gold room were constructed. The 28 Level Adit was developed
as were
important infrastructure such as roads, a water supply scheme from
Kogai River and the CIP Pond. Alipis 1, 2 and 3 and Yokalama 1
and 2 were built
during Stage 1.
<P>

60. During Stage 1 Placer commenced underground mining operations. Underground
mining allows the targeting of high grade ore, and
by mining this ore first
Placer was able to achieve high rates of return at an early point in the life
of the project. The ore was
crushed at the Anawe Plant Site and approximately
70% of the gold was recovered as a gravity concentrate by carbon in pulp (CIP)
treatment of the pyrite concentrate. The CIP residue (containing approximately
30% of the gold) was stored in the CIP Pond to await
the installation of the
autoclaves in Stage 2.
<P>

61. Stage 2 consisted of increasing the electricity supply to 30.2mW by
constructing a gas turbine electrical generating plant at
Hides (the Anawe
Power Station did not generate enough electricity for operation of the extra
facilities at the Plant), and a 76
km transmission line from Hides to Porgera.
A 310 tonne per day oxygen plant and three pressure autoclaves were installed
at the
Anawe Plant Site. Stage 2 involved processing the flotation sludge
stockpiled in the CIP Pond during the operating phase of stage
1, and the
facilitation of a permanent supply of water from Waille Creek. This stage was
completed in August 1991.
<P>

62. Stage 3 consisted of the construction of a primary gyratory crusher, one
SAG mill, one ball mill and ancillary equipment at
the Tawisakale Plant Site.
The grinding circuit at the Tawisakale Plant Site had the capacity to crush
4,500 tonnes of ore per day.
With the ability to crush much more ore at the
Tawisakale Plant Site, the gravity concentration circuit at the Anawe Plant
Site was
abandoned. Underground mining activities were boosted to 4500 tpd and
the open pit was developed to provide 1000 tonnes per day.
The
concentrator/oxidation circuits at Anawe were expanded to 8000 tonnes per day
capacity. The crushed ore, in the form of slurry,
was transported through a
pipeline to the expanded flotation circuit at Anawe. The Hides site was also
expanded to 33 mW maximum
power generation capacity. This work was completed in
September, 1992.
<P>

63. Stage 4A included the installation of a fourth autoclave and an additional
75 tonne per day oxygen plant at the Anawe Plant
Site, a semi-autogenous bypass
circuit (SABC) at the Tawisakale Plant Site, a decline linking underground 28
Level Adit and 40 Level
Adit and an overland conveyor between the 40 Level Adit
and the Tawisakale grinding mill. The expansion during Stage 4A enabled the
mine to produce 8,000 tonnes of ore per day. This stage was completed in
approximately September, 1993.
<P>

64. Stage 4B consisted of optimising the existing facility. Additional oxygen
producing capacity was provided and an additional
SAG and ball mill were
installed. The milling capacity was increased to 16,500 tonnes per day. Stage
4B started in late 1994 and
was estimated to take eighteen months to
construct."
<P>

59  	That description was elaborated upon by Arthur Hood (Hood) who
had been employed by Placer in a variety of managerial positions
during the
development and operation of the mine. In relation to those various stages of
construction, he identified the need for
the use of explosives in the
performance of that work, for example, in relation to the Tawisakale plant site
that was situated at
the location of "a hill that had to be drilled and blasted
and excavated to create the basis, the foundations of that plant site"
(T110.25).
<P>

60  	Hood also identified construction works in relation to a
structure described as the "ICI Building" as an explosives plant,
part of Stage
1. 
<P>

61  	The reference to Status Report 64 in the 1992 endorsement
reflected the fact that from time to time the PJV provided Munich
Re with a
status report for the project. The status reports, so provided, confirmed the
construction of an explosives facility at
the site as part of Stage 1 and, as
referred to later in these reasons, also disclosed that ICI Dulux Papua New
Guinea Pty Ltd (ICI)
was a contractor to the project as an explosives supplier.

<P>

62  	The principal significance of the endorsements, as a matter of
construction, of the endorsed policy, is to be found in the
extension of the
cover under the 1992 and 1994 endorsement to an "operational "all risks"" cover
in respect of completed Stages 1,
2 and 3, until completion of Stage 4 as under
the 1992 endorsement, and to the provision of such a cover in respect of Stages
1,
2, 3 and 4(a), until completion of Stage 4(b) under the 1994 endorsement.
<P>

63  	It has been submitted on behalf of Niugini Insurance that, by
recourse to extrinsic evidence, this extended cover is not to
be given its
natural and ordinary meaning and is to be construed as a simple extension of
the phased handover clause of the policy.
Niugini Insurance sought no relief by
way of rectification. The extrinsic evidence to which reference is made is that
of Hettler
as follows:
<P>

"82. "All Risks" is the term used in such policies for the Material Damage
cover. The policy definition of Property Insured in the
Section 1, the Material
Damage section, reflects that the cover afforded was for "Works", the existing
adit and Nebilyer to Porgera
access road, and Mining Plant and Equipment,
subject to exclusions for tunnelling works and galleries (exception (m)) and
actual
mining works (other than the adit, new drive and ventilation shaft -
exception (o)).
<P>

83. The Phased Handover General Condition of the policy reflects the
continuation of the cover afforded by the policy with respect
to phases and
sections of the works after their construction has been completed and they have
become operational. In later discussions
and documentation with the broker
about the cover under the policy, this aspect of the cover was separately
classified and referred
to as the operational cover under the policy, or as the
"Operational All Risks" cover. Once part of the works covered by policy was
completed, it ceased to be classified on an EAR (Erection All Risks) basis and
was then rated on the Operational All Risks basis.
These classifications were
relevant not only for premium purposes but also to the cover and time
deductible applied under Section
III."
<P>

64  	That material was admitted over objection on the basis that it
provided evidence of the meaning of the term "all risks" as
a term of art where
used in the Section I cover and, as to paragraph 83, as evidence of the
commercial background to the "<u>PHASED HANDOVER</u>" clause of the policy.
That clause was in the following terms:
<P>

<b>"PHASED HANDOVER</b>
<P>

Notwithstanding the progressive handover and/or occupation of phases or
sections of the works the cover provided by this policy
shall continue in full
force and effect with respect to the whole of the works until handover of the
last phase or section of the
works."
<P>

65  	It was submitted on behalf of Niugini Insurance that the
extended cover under the endorsed policy was merely a revised expression
of the
phased handover condition of the policy resulting from the extension of the
construction period to 66 months under the 1992
endorsement and to 81 months
under the 1994 endorsement. 
<P>

66  	The use which Niugini Insurance seeks to make of the evidence of
Hettler, in my view, is impermissible. The evidence simply
established the
sequence of events leading up to the provision of the extended cover and could
not be regarded as admissible to place
some restricted meaning upon the natural
and ordinary meaning of the terms of the extended cover. 
<P>

67  	To equate the operational cover to the nature of the cover
contemplated under the phased handover condition of the policy is
plainly wrong
on any view of the meaning of the terms of the extended cover under the
endorsed policy. Plainly, all that the phased
handover clause affects is the
retention of the material damage cover in respect of all stages of construction
involved in the insured
property until completion of the last stage. It says
nothing about an operational cover. 
<P>

68  	If that construction of the operational clause was correct, it
fails to explain the absence of such a provision with the 1990
endorsement.
<P>

69  	Furthermore, the mere extended time for completion of the four
stages would not require any endorsement other than a confirmation
that the
phased handover condition applied to the extended time for construction of the
various stages. What in fact was provided,
was an "operational all risk
insurance" for an additional premium of several million dollars. 
<P>

70  	In my view, the extended cover under the endorsed policy covered
risks involved in the operation of stages 1, 2 and 3 under
the 1992 endorsement
and stages 1 to 4(a) under the 1994 endorsement. A consequence of that
construction is that works such as the
explosives plant would enjoy the benefit
of an operational all risks cover until completion of stage 4. 
<P>

71  	Clearly, on that construction of the endorsed policy, an
explosives contractor to the project or an explosives supplier on
site of the
project would fall within the definition of the insured. 
<P>

72  	In relation to the operation of the explosives facility, there
is no warrant for the construction advanced on behalf of Niugini
Insurance that
that operational cover should be construed as limited to operations in
connection with the performance of the works
in stage 4, all other stages
having been completed at the time of the inception of the endorsed policy.
Implicit in that view is
a recognition that the exclusions in Section 1 of the
endorsed policy do not operate to exclude the open pit operations forming part
of the project. 
<P>

73  	I think the evidence established that there was present on site
throughout the performance of stages 1 to 3, an explosives
plant operated by
ICI. That operation ceased as at 15 November 1992 when ICI was replaced by
Dyno. The evidence also established
that the ICI operation had been engaged in
connection with the construction of works falling within the description of
property insured
under the policy. The evidence further established that as at
the time of the 1992 endorsement, stages 1 to 3 had been completed.
It was
Niugini Insurance's case that that marked the end of ICI's association with the
construction of insured property. 
<P>

74  	However, as at the 1992 endorsement, there still remained to be
performed stage 4A. That stage included "a decline linking
underground 28 Level
Adit and 40 Level Adit ...". I think it is common ground that Stage 4 works
fell within the description of property
insured, notwithstanding exceptions m)
and o). In that context I note that under the policy, 'property insured'
included the "Existing
Adit" which I construe to be the level 28 adit. I do not
think the evidence specifically addressed the identification of the "new
drive
and ventilation shaft" which, on the proper construction of the policy, fell
within the definition of property insured. In
the absence of that specific
evidence, I think the drive referred to in stage 4 should be treated as the
"new drive" referred to
in the proviso to exception o) in Section I of the
policy. I do not understand it to be suggested that the connecting drive had
not
formed part of the original Stage 4 and hence part of the works falling
within the description of property insured in Section I of
the policy. 
<P>

75  	I think it is reasonably clear that ICI was associated, as
contractor and supplier on site, with the performance of Stage 4(a)
to the
extent that it involved construction of the connecting drive. I think the
extended cover under the endorsed policy clearly
covered the explosives
facility as part of the completed stages of the insured property and covered
the operation of the facility
under the operational all risks cover, together
with contractors or suppliers on site engaged in the operation of the
explosives
facility in connection with the project.
<P>

76  	In my view, an operational all risks cover could not sensibly
have any other operation given the full understanding by the
parties of the
project as one consisting of the development and operation of the mine by the
PJV as owner, developer and miner: hence
the perceived need for exclusions m)
and o) in Section I of the endorsed policy. 
<P>

77  	Coincident with the inception of the 1992 endorsement, which was
dated 16 November 1992, there occurred a change in the operation
of the Stage 1
explosives plant with the substitution of Dyno for ICI as the explosives
contractor-supplier on site, effective from
15 November 1992. 
<P>

78  	In order to understand the nature of the operation of the
explosives plant, I think it is necessary to have some knowledge
of the
materials used in the making of explosives and of the nature of the processing
of those materials for use as explosives in
connection with the project. 
<P>

79  	The type of explosives differ according to whether their use is
required in dry or wet conditions and also depending upon the
nature of the
explosion produced. Explosives are capable of producing two types of energy
known respectively as "shock energy" and
"gas energy", the latter being of most
utility in fractured block where the gas energy can explore the faults and
loosen the surrounding
rock. By contrast, shock energy is of most use in the
cracking of more sound rock material. For the most part, gas energy explosives
were used in connection with the Porgera project.
<P>

80  	Another category of explosives is known as cap sensitive
explosives, distinguishing them from explosives which, in addition
to a
detonator, usually require a primer to produce an explosion. A further
categorising of explosives emerges from classifications
recognised by the
United Nations and various codes published under the auspices of the Standards
Association of Australia. 
<P>

81  	The following is a simple dictionary of some of the principal
substances used in the making of explosives:
<P>

(a) Fuel phase: This is a mixture of oils, possibly waxes, a surface active
agent and emulsifiers.
<P>

(b) Matrix or emulsion: An oxidised solution, usually consisting of nitrates,
namely ammonium nitrate plus fuel phase mixed in a
blender to produce a
continuous phase of the oil.
<P>

(c) EP Gold: A form of emulsion.
<P>

(d) Powergel gold: A sensitised emulsion.
<P>

(e) DP 400: Emulsion using a mainly hot ammonium nitrate solution.
<P>

(f) Emulite: A cap sensitive explosive made by sensitising hot emulsion by the
addition of "Q-cells" or "micro balloons" and which
is cooled and packaged into
'sausage' type cartridges under pressure. A wax substance is included at an
elevated temperature so that
on cooling it solidifies and holds the Emulite in
a packaged form.
<P>

(g) Amex: A granular explosive consisting of 94 per cent ammonium nitrate in a
prilled form and six per cent fuel oil requiring
a primer to effect
explosion.
<P>

(h) Amex LD: A member of the Amex family to which is added polystyrene beads to
reduce its density, and hence strength, per unit
of volume. The "LD" suffix
derives from the words "lower density".
<P>

(i) ANFO: A similar product to Amex.
<P>

(j) ANFOPS: A similar product to Amex LD.
<P>

(k) Detonator: An initiator for explosive charges consisting of a base cap,
base charge, priming charge, a delay element and a signal
tube attached through
a plug at the top of the detonator which could be crimped into position by a
crimper. 
<P>

82  	The ICI operation was carried out from the explosives plant on
site. Most of the explosive materials were transported by road
and air to
Porgera with some preparation of explosives being performed within the site
plant. The ammonium nitrate and emulsion was
shipped to Lae in containers and,
from there, were transported by truck to the site plant. 
<P>

83  	The trucks usually travelled in convoy to guard against any
belligerent elements in the local population. Cartridged explosives
or
detonators were also shipped to Lae and from there sent to an ICI storage
facility in the vicinity of Lae. From that point they
were transported by air
to Porgera and the unloading supervised by ICI and the explosives and
detonators placed in underground stores
at the site. 
<P>

84  	Emulsion was stored in twenty tonne capacity iso-tanks placed
adjacent to the plant. For most of the period that ICI was one
site, the
storage was limited to two such tanks with some additional storage located
around the perimeter of the plant boundary.
Towards the end of ICI's contract
with the PJV, in anticipation of significantly increased mine production, the
storage capacity
was increased to twelve or thirteen iso-tanks so providing a
capacity in the order of 250 tonnes. 
<P>

85  	Peter Charles Smith (PC Smith) was an employee of ICI Australia
Operations Pty Ltd (also referred to as ICI) stationed at Lae
and responsible
as production superintendent for overseeing the operations of the Porgera
plant. He gave evidence to the effect that
had the ICI contract been renewed
with the PJV in 1992, then ICI would have commenced manufacture of matrix on
site as:
<P>

".... above a certain level of usage ICI would invariably put a manufacturing
facility in themselves. The economics of putting in
a manufacturing plant for
small quantities doesn't ... justify it. If the quantities were going to get
bigger ... then the probability
is that ICI might have put in a manufacturing
plant to provide it. In other words, I think it is unlikely that we would have
stored
there four times the quantity."
<P>

(T1557.55-1558.7)
<P>

86  	The materials constituting the Amex and Amex LD explosives were
mixed on site using what is known as a coxan mixer. Powergel
was prepared on
site at the plant in a mobile mixer which resembled a concrete mixing truck.
The EP Gold emulsion was pumped from
an iso-tank and micro balloons were tipped
into the mixing drum from a forklift platform. Although Hood described powergel
as cap
sensitive, I think for practical purposes it was not. 
<P>

87  	I think the key technical evidence relating to the handling of
emulsion is that of the report of Eva Gunnarson of Nitro Nobel
(the Gunnarson
report), namely:
<P>

"Pumping of emulsion explosives can be extremely hazardous and should be
regarded as the critical part of the process.
<P>

Pumping of matrix (not sensitized emulsion) should be performed with the same
safety arrangements as pumping of explosives. The
reason is that accidents has
occured (sic) in matrix-pumping, probably by unwanted and unknown
sensitizing.
<P>

To make an explosive detonate you must add a certain amount of energy. It is
enough to raise the energy above the critical value
in a very small volume of
the explosive to start the de-composition, which can start the
deflagration/detonation. This procedure
can occur very fast and if the
explosive is included, as in a pump, the reaction goes even faster." 
<P>

I think the above suffers somewhat from the translation of the original report
and I think the word "included" probably refers to
confinement of the matrix.

<P>

88  	The contract with Dyno for the manufacture and supply of
explosives and explosives accessories was that between Placer, as
"manager" of
the PJV, and Dyno dated 25 March 1993 with a date of commencement of 15
November 1992 (the Dyno contract). Under the
Dyno contract, Dyno leased to
Placer:
<P>

" (a) an Emulsion manufacturing plant;
<P>

(b) a plant for assembling nonel &reg; detonators;
<P>

(c) a bulk explosives delivery unit for direct discharge of Explosives into
open pit blast holes and;
<P>

(d) a Mercedes 6 x 6 truck on which the bulk explosive unit is to be
mounted"
<P>

89  	That equipment was defined under the Dyno contract as the
"leased equipment" and it is so referred to in these reasons. Emulsion
was
defined to mean:
<P>

"... liquid substance manufactured by Dyno ... to be mixed with ammonium
nitrate to make heavy ANFO"
<P>

90  	Dyno warranted that the leased equipment was, inter alia,
"suitable for manufacturing and supplying Explosives and Accessories
in
accordance with the requirements of the (Dyno contract)". In addition, Dyno
covenanted to "maintain the Leased Equipment in good
working condition and ...
(to) be responsible for maintenance and replacement costs of (certain) mobile
equipment" while Placer was
to "be responsible for the maintenance and
replacement of the ... (existing plant and facilities used for explosive supply
and delivery)".
Placer was to be responsible for the insurance of the equipment
last referred to. 
<P>

91  	Payment for the explosives, in the case of bulk explosives, was
to be upon delivery into the blast hole while other packaged
explosives,
detonators and accessories were to be paid for upon delivery into the magazine.

<P>

92  	Dyno also covenanted to operate the leased equipment only with
personnel "skilled and experienced at their respective trades
and callings".
Placer had the power to direct Dyno to remove an employee for misconduct or
where proven to be incompetent. It was
part of the Dyno contract that Dyno
would provide technical advice and information to Placer. It was Dyno's
obligation to obtain
all necessary permits, approvals and licences for the
performance of the Dyno contract and Dyno undertook to comply with all laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations of any statutory authority having
jurisdiction over that performance. 
<P>

93  	Cl 12.1 of the Dyno contract contained a warranty by Dyno that
its employees would "at all times carry out their work with
the highest regard
for the safety of all personnel in and around the Porgera Operations". 
<P>

94  	Dyno and Placer exchanged indemnities. In the case of Dyno it
indemnified Placer against "all injury, loss or damage whatsoever
to any
property real or personal of Placer or of other persons including Dyno ... its
employees and agents; and ... all personal
injury or death of any person
whatsoever; which may arise from any act ... of negligence or misconduct of
Dyno ...". I regard that
as an indemnity that extended to a third party
liability of Placer arising out of Dyno's negligence. Placer's indemnity was
expressed
in like terms. 
<P>

95  	Cl 15 of the Dyno contract is, I think, of particular importance
in relation to the insurance issues raised in these proceedings
and accordingly
it is set out in full below:
<P>

<b>"15.0 INSURANCE</b>
<P>

15.1 Dyno Wesfarmers shall take out, maintain and meet the cost of the
following insurances;
<P>

(a) Workers compensation insurance as required by statute in respect of any of
its employees or agents or other persons employed
under this Agreement
including common law cover of not less than K2,000,000 for any one occurrence;
and
<P>

(b) Public liability insurance for an amount of not less than K2,000,000 for
any one occurrence arising out of the execution of
Dyno Wesfarmers rights and
obligations under the Agreement in the event of death or injury to any person
who is not at the time of
the occurrence engaged in the service of Dyno
Wesfarmers and damage to property not belonging to or in the care of Dyno
Wesfarmers.

<P>

15.2 Placer shall take out, maintain and meet the cost of the following
insurances;
<P>

(a) A Contract Works Material Damage and Public Liability insurance Policy
covering the Leased Equipment. Such coverage does not
include the Dyno
Wesfarmers constructional plants, machinery, tools, equipment, temporary
buildings, motor vehicles, personal effects
of their employees or material and
property in the course of manufacture off-site.
<P>

(b) Placer shall arrange on behalf of itself and Dyno Wesfarmers a marine
transit insurance policy covering the Leased Equipment
and other goods supplied
by Dyno Wesfarmers pursuant to the Agreement whilst the Leased Equipment and
other goods are in transit
between Townsville and Porgera.
<P>

(c) Motor Vehicle Third Party insurance covering Placer vehicles which may be
used by Dyno Wesfarmers personnel for an amount of
not less than Two Million
Kina
<P>

[(the cl 15.2 insurance)]
<P>

The above insurances shall provide coverage for losses caused through civil
unrest. Placer will provide upon request a summary of
the coverage in place
Dyno Wesfarmers shall be responsible for the amount of the excesses specified
in the above mentioned policies
and shall indemnify Placer against all losses,
claims and demands up to the amount of such excesses.
<P>

The effecting and keeping in force of insurance by Placer in favour of Dyno
Wesfarmers shall not in any way limit the responsibilities,
obligations and
liabilities of Dyno Wesfarmers under other provisions of the Contract."
<P>

96  	There was a force majeure clause.
<P>

97  	If Dyno is an insured under the policy or the endorsed policy,
it raises no issue as to the ambit of the terms of the cl 15.2
insurance as one
complying with Placer's obligation to raise an insurance for the benefit of
Dyno under cl 15.2 of the Dyno contract.
Section I of the endorsed policy is
capable of providing a wider indemnity than that covering the "Leased
Equipment". The public
liability cover contemplated by the cl 15.2 insurance
falls within the operational all risks extended cover provided under the
endorsed
policy. 
<P>

98  	For the purpose of the performance of the Dyno contract, Dyno
utilised the facilities previously used by ICI. In relation to
that layout, Ian
Taylor Smith (IT Smith), held the designated position of General Manager,
International with Dyno between 1988 and
1995. His principal duties involved
the managing of Dyno's depot plants and marketing. He described the layout of
the Dyno plant
at the Porgera site in the following terms:
<P>

"(Dyno) had inherited from ICI the site which consisted of a shed, a
compressor, the store, a truck and a few other things such
as ancillary
machinery etc. As ICI had imported the majority of its explosives and hadn't
engaged in manufacturing on site apart
from the manufacture of ANFO and heavy
ANFO, it was necessary for (Dyno) to ship to Porgera Mine the emulsion plant,
the emulite
plant and the nonel plant as well as most of the bulk stores shown
down the right hand side of the site map. Otherwise the layout
of the site was
generally in accordance with the previous ICI layout."
<P>

That description was inaccurate to the extent that it omitted reference to
ICI's manufacture of powergel on site.
<P>

99  	Some better understanding of the plant referred to by IT Smith
may be obtained from the general layout plan and from the flow
sheet relevant
to the emulsion and emulite plants, schedules "1" and "2" respectively to these
reasons. 
<P>

100  	In relation to the Schedule 1 layout plan (Dyno's layout) and
the flow sheet, there are some features that might be conveniently
dealt with
at this stage which gain greater significance in the consideration of some of
the insurance issues raised in these proceedings.
Whereas ICI had transported
matrix to the site, Dyno prepared that emulsion on site in the emulsion plant.

<P>

101  	The significance of the distances shown between various
elements in the plant on the layout plan lies in the exposure of those
elements
to damage as a result of mishaps in other elements of the Dyno plant. Of
particular significance is the "EMULITE PACKAGING"
operation in which the
equipment, shown on the flow sheet as "Emulite packaging mono pump", was used.

<P>

102  	The preparation and packaging of emulite under conditions of
applied heat and pressure through the mono pump is at the centre
of issues
relating to the mechanics of the explosions. 
<P>

103  	Sensitising of emulsion was carried out by ICI at the plant.
Dyno performed a similar operation in mobile mixing units, known
as "3T
trucks", at the blast hole site in the open cut mining. 
<P>

104  	That operation was described by IT Smith as follows:
<P>

"The matrix as stored in the tanks is transferred into trucks ... 3T trucks.
They combine ammonium nitrate with fuel oil with the
matrix in an auger in the
truck and deliver it in a bore hole, or blast hole, just prior to detonation in
an open cut mining environment."
<P>

(T440.37)
<P>

105  	He contrasted that with emulite production as follows;
<P>

"In the Emulite production, not only are the Q-cells added but there is a wax
substance that is also included which is at an elevated
temperature, so when it
cools to ambient temperature, or is quenched, the wax is solidified and hold
the explosives in a packaged
form."
<P>

(T440.50)
<P>

106  	The operator skill required in the two operations was described
by IT Smith as follows:
<P>

"Q. The reason I ask, I am wondering whether a person who is skilled in the
manufacture of emulsion you would expect to be skilled
in the manufacture of
Emulite?
<P>

A. He would have a good working knowledge of the plant process, the additions.
But it is nor fair to say that it is exactly the
same because cap-sensitive is
a - handling cap-sensitive is an inherent increase, or is a larger increase in
the risk exposure than
it is in matrix, or non-cap-sensitive explosives.
<P>

Q. Does it follow from that though that the selection that would be appropriate
to select a person skilled in the manufacture of
emulsion to go on to the
process of manufacturing Emulite?
<P>

A. That's normally how it progresses. That somebody will manufacture bulk
products before they go on to the cap process." 
<P>

(T440.58-441.18)
<P>

107  	Both the setting up and method of operation of the ICI and the
Dyno plants were subject to the approval of the Papua New Guinea
Department of
Mines and Energy (the Mines Department).
<P>

108  	Under the proper construction of the 1992 endorsement cover,
Dyno was both a contractor and a supplier on site for the project
and, in my
view, fell within the definition of 'the insured' within the terms of the
endorsed policy. 
<P>

109  	I am also of the view that the endorsed policy was one which
satisfied the obligations of Placer to effect a contractors all
risk "Contract
Works Material Damage and Public Liability... policy" pursuant to cl 15.2 of
the Dyno contract. 
<P>

110  	The Dyno contract was entered into by Placer as manager of the
PJV. I have construed the contract as one entered into by Placer
as agent for
named principals, namely the PJV. 
<P>

111  	The Dyno contract arose out of negotiations with the PJV, which
also involved ICI, for the maintenance and supply of explosives
for the project
from November 1992 when ICI's contract term ended. In early negotiations it was
contemplated that preparation of
explosives on site would follow similar lines
to that of the ICI operation. Dyno's proposal of 27 April 1992 opened up the
prospect
of further manufacturing processes on site for the preparation of
matrix and of the assembly of detonators on site. The Mines Department
was
introduced to the negotiations in mid 1992 with the objective of obtaining
approval of detonator assembly, explosives manufacture,
the plants and
chemicals proposed to be used and of the manner and means of transport of the
various materials. Those matters involved
the Mines Department's chief
inspector of mines, John Kennedy Twaddle (Twaddle), who visited Australia for
the purpose of inspection
of Dyno's plant. Both the nonel plant and the
emulsion plant were plants previously used by Dyno and were situated at the
time of
negotiations in Queensland, where they were inspected by Twaddle. The
emulsion plant was "water tested" there.
<P>

112  	ICI remained under consideration as a future supplier until
September 1992, up to which point ICI was proposing the continuation
of their
existing approach to the preparation and supply of explosives for the project
with further provision of additional emulsion
tank storage on site, with a
capacity of 120 tons. By mid September 1992, approval had been given by the PJV
to replace ICI with
Dyno. Draft agreements were exchanged in September 1992, in
terms which reflected the terms finally agreed upon in the Dyno contract.
Revisions of drafts continued into November 1992 to a point where sufficient
level of agreement had been reached so as to permit
the commencement of
manufacturing and supply of explosives on site by Dyno on 15 November 1992. 
<P>

113  	It is common ground that the explosions were initiated by an
explosion in the emulite package line and that the stored emulsion
later
exploded with devastating effect as an aftermath to the emulite explosion. The
parties have reached agreement on numerous quantum
issues arising out of the
effect of the explosions.
<P>

114  	There is no dispute that the mill, part of the ore processing
plant referred to below, was shut down for 4.8 days and that
underground mining
was halted for a period of two days and did not get back to full production
until 15 August 1994. In the case
of the open pit operation, it was shut down
for two days and did not resume full operation until 22 August 1994 with the
resumption
of blasting. Some waste mining had been performed during that
period. 
<P>

115  	It was an extraordinary achievement to have the interruption to
the operation limited in the manner outlined above when the
extent of the
tragedy is fully appreciated. While the parties have been able to reach
substantial agreement as to the extent of the
interruption to the mining
operations, the financial consequences of that interruption have been the
subject of considerable dispute.
<P>

116  	Hood gave evidence of the general nature of the mine
operations. Open cut and underground mining took place simultaneously
as
separate operations, with production from the open cut going to a surface
primary crusher when the ore was of sufficiently high
grade, otherwise the ore
was trucked to stock piles with waste material going to one of two dumps
referred to, respectively, as the
SDC and Kogai dumps. The low grade stockpile
ore was trucked from stockpile to the primary crusher to mix with other ore
being served
directly to that crusher from the open pit from time to time. 
<P>

117  	In the case of underground mining, the ore produced from that
operation was crushed at a primary crusher below surface and
from there
conveyed to the surface. The higher grade ore from the primary crusher from the
open pit was fed to the coarse ore stockpile,
as was the underground mining
production, and from there it went to the SAG mill and then to the concentrator
and to a leeching and
refining process for the production of Dore gold bars.
<P>

118  	The PJV makes a business interruption claim against Dyno in the
PJV's own right (the business interruption claim), as the
loses so sustained
did not fall for indemnification under the endorsed policy as a consequence of
the waiting period limitation imposed
under Section III of the endorsed policy.
The PJV has brought a further claim in its own right against Dyno in respect of
material
damage, the amount of which has been agreed (the material damage
claim). There is a further material damage claim brought by the
PJV against
Dyno (the subrogation claim), the amount of which has been agreed as between
Dyno and Niugini Insurance, except as to
a claim in relation to the leased
equipment which was destroyed in the explosion. 
<P>

119  	Dyno also makes a material damage claim against Niugini
Insurance, under sec I of the endorsed policy in respect of material
damage
suffered by it (sec I claim). Dyno also seeks to pass on to Niugini Insurance
any liability Dyno may have to the PJV (sec
II claim). 
<P>

120  	The business interruption claim and the material damage claim
are made in tort and under the Dyno contract, as is the subrogation
claim which
is brought by the PJV on behalf of Niugini Insurance, although not expressly so
pleaded. It is brought by the PJV pursuant
to a deed (the settlement deed)
entered into in October 1996 between Niugini Insurance, the PJV and other
related companies as the
"named insureds" (the insureds). 
<P>

121  	Under the settlement deed, the PJV settled claims under Section
I of the endorsed policy, including a claim in relation to
the leased
equipment. Under the deed the insureds accepted the sum of US$11,765,811, in
consideration of which it was provided as
follows:
<P>

"... the insureds in relation to loss and damage so far discovered or
identified by them hereby wholly release and discharge (Niugini
Insurance) from
any further claim, suit, action or demand under Section I of the Policy, and
agree to make no further claim or demand
under Section I in their own names
(whether on their own account or on behalf of any other person or company)."

<P>

122  	In relation to the leased equipment, it was provided as
follows:
<P>

"The Insureds further agree that the consideration for this Deed includes an
amount to be paid by the Underwriters with respect
to loss and/or damage to the
Leased Equipment, and that such amount is in full and final satisfaction of all
claims with respect
to such loss and damage, now or hereafter available to or
claimed by the Insureds, Dyno ... or any other party having an interest
in the
Leased Equipment, and the Insureds accordingly warrant:
<P>

(i) that they will indemnify the <b>Underwriters against any claim
(including</b> the costs and expenses therefor) made by the Insureds, Dyno ...
and/or any associated, subsidiary or parent companies thereof; and
<P>

(ii) that there are no other parties having or claiming an interest <b>of
</b>any <b>kind</b> whatsoever in the Leased Equipment."
<P>

123  	Under cll 4, 5 and 6, the insureds agreed to assist Niugini
Insurance in a variety of ways as follows:
<P>

<b>"4. Duty to Assist</b>
<P>

The Insureds agree to co-operate and assist the Underwriters (at the
Underwriters' expense) in any investigations of the circumstances
of the
Explosions and the prosecution or defence of any claim by any other party
arising out of the Explosions, and the Insureds
shall use their reasonable best
<b>endeavours</b> in the following:
<P>

<b>procuring the co-operation and assistance from any persons from whom the
Underwriters or their representatives wish to obtain a statement,</b>
information, opinion, report, documents or investigative material relating to
the conduct of the Facility and/or to the Explosions;
<P>

providing all information, <b>documents,</b> opinion, investigations or other
materials or intelligence with respect to the conduct of the Facility or to the
Explosions; and
<P>

arranging for the Underwriters and/or their representatives interviews with any
persons within the control or influence of the Insureds
(or any of them) to
obtain statements, information, opinions, reports, documents, investigations or
other intelligence with respect
to the conduct of the Facility or to the
Explosions.
<P>

5. <b>Proceedings to Recover Losses</b>
<P>

It is acknowledged by the parties that the Joint Venturers have commenced
proveedings (sic) in the Supreme Court of New South Wales
against Dyno ...
claiming damages for the losses suffered by the Joint Venturers including
losses paid out by the Underwriters to
the Insureds under the Policy, including
the consideration for this release ("the Subrogated Claim") and for other
losses suffered
by the insured's ("the Other Claim"). It is further noted that
Dyno ... claims to be entitled to indemnity from Underwriters under
section II
of the Policy in respect of such liability.
<P>

6. The Insureds agree to permit the Subrogated Claim to be added and included
in the proceedings for the other Claim upon the following
conditions:
<P>

(i) the Underwriters shall pay and be responsible for any additional costs
reasonably incurred by the Insureds' solicitors occasioned
by the addition and
inclusion of the Subrogated Claim in the proceedings for the other Claim;
<P>

(ii) the Underwriters' lawyers will be entitled to monitor the progress of such
proceedings and for that purpose shall be entitled
to such information as the
Underwriters would be entitled to as an insurer subject to any rights or
interest of the Insureds which
may arise from the dispute as to the entitlement
of Dyno ...;
<P>

(iii) to avoid the potential for conflict of interest and/or duplication of
costs, the Underwriters' lawyers shall wherever possible
draft and/or provide
any documents, correspondence or parts thereof relevant to the Subrogated Claim
so that the Insureds' solicitors
can include such documents, correspondence or
parts thereof in their own conduct of the proceedings;
<P>

(iv) the Insureds' solicitors shall from time to time render accounts to the
Underwriters via the Underwriters' lawyers in a form
which sets out:
<P>

(b) the precise work performed or expenditure incurred with respect to such
costs;
<P>

(c) the rates and times with respect to each item of such work; and
<P>

(d) the reason that such work is claimed from the Underwriters rather than from
the Insureds;"
<P>

124  	It was in those circumstances that the subrogation claim was
brought and Niugini Insurance only became involved in the proceedings
under the
cross claim brought against it by Dyno. When Niugini Insurance raised a 'party'
point as a defence to the Dyno cross-claim,
on the basis that Dyno was not a
named party to the endorsed policy, the PJV sought to amend its summons to join
Niugini Insurance.
It was clear that the PJV was faced with little alternative
when seen in the context of Dyno's cross-claim against the PJV for breach
of
the covenant to provide the cl 15.2 insurance. 
<P>

125  	That amendment was opposed by Niugini Insurance, inter alia, on
the ground that the bringing of proceedings by the PJV against
Niugini
Insurance in respect of Dyno's claims against Niugini Insurance was in breach
of the PJV's obligations under the settlement
deed. The amendment was allowed
and, in the course of a directions hearing related to that amendment, I pointed
out to senior counsel
for Niugini Insurance that the construction sought to be
placed upon the settlement deed by Niugini Insurance involved the proposition
that the insurer and named insureds had agreed to defeat the interest of a
co-insured in the event that it was found that Dyno was
an insured within the
meaning of the endorsed policy. 
<P>

126  	Niugini Insurance initially raised certain defences to that
amended claim by the PJV, based upon its construction of the settlement
deed.
That representation or estoppel case has not been pressed. 
<P>

127  	In so far as the settlement deed provided for payment in
respect of the leased equipment, the PJV and Dyno entered into a
further deed
in November 1996 (the Dyno settlement) under which it was recited that Dyno had
assessed the loss and damage to the
leased equipment in the sum of A$3,517,807
and that the PJV had made a claim under the policy which included a claim for
loss and
damage to the leased equipment. It was agreed under the Dyno
settlement as follows:
<P>

"Upon receipt of the said sum of A$3,517,807 under the Policy the (PJV) shall
pay it to (Dyno) and the receipt of that sum by (Dyno)
is hereby
acknowledged."
<P>

128  	Dyno provided the following indemnity:
<P>

"(Dyno) hereby indemnifies the (PJV) ... against any liability ... arising from
any claim by (Dyno) or any other person in respect
of the loss or damage to the
Leased Equipment." 
<P>

[the Dyno settlement indemnity]
<P>

129  	It is common ground that the proper law of the endorsed policy
is the law of Papua New Guinea. In relation to that law, by
schedule 2.2(1) of
the Papua New Guinea <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> (the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>), it is provided as
follows:
<P>

"(1) Subject to this Part, the principles and rules that formed, immediately
before Independence Day, the principles and rules of
common law and equity in
England are adopted, and shall be applied and enforced, as part of the
underlying law, except if, and to
the extent that - 
<P>

(a) they are inconsistent with a Constitutional Law or a statute; or
<P>

(b) they are inapplicable or inappropriate to the circumstances of the country
from time to time; or
<P>

(c) in their application to any particular matter they are inconsistent with
custom as adopted by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1."</a>
<P>

130  	The date of independence in Papua New Guinea was 16 September
1975 which is treated as the "cut-off date" in relation to the
reception of
English law. However, the notion of a cut-off date is misleading as it is clear
from judicial consideration of schedule
2.2 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> that regard
will be had to post 1975 English decisions, particularly of the House of Lords
in making declaratory pronouncements of
the law. That has given rise to a
distinction between those types of decisions of the House of Lords and
decisions of the House of
Lords in a law-making role. A broader distinction has
been drawn between English law as at the date of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and post
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> English decisions: one school of thought in relation to that
distinction being as follows:
<P>

"It seems clear enough that that provision (referring to Schedule 2.2(1))
adopts, subject to the important exceptions and limitations
therein, as a
residuary law, the great body of judge-made law as it stood, and was applied,
in the courts in England on 16th September,
1975. That date was fixed for
purposes of certainty. Judicial creativity thereafter is a matter for the
courts of this country, and
no other: <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>Sch. 2.4. In the
light of the clear constitutional intention, no Blackstonian theory that
"judges do not make law, but only declare
what has always been the law", can be
relied upon to support the adoption under <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i>Sch. 2.2.(1) of
rules of the common law in England first enunciated after Independence."
(<b>State v Allan Woila</b> [1978] PNGLR 99 at 103 per Kearney J.)
<P>

131  	Kearney J qualified that neat division in the <b>State v Bisket
Uranguae Pokia</b> [1980] PNGLR 97 at 99, 100 by recognising that a post 1975
English decision reversing a pre <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> English decision as erroneous law
would gain recognition under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. Robin Stanley O'Regan QC
(O'Regan QC) gave evidence of the law of Papua New Guinea. He held high
qualifications to do so. After
reviewing the above and other authorities on
this subject, he expressed the following opinion:
<P>

"It is clear from the above cases that decisions of the English courts decided
after Independence in 1975 are not binding in Papua
New Guinea. They do not
form part of the body of common law and equity which applied in England at that
time and which was then adopted
in Papua New Guinea. Nor do decisions of the
Australian Courts. However, there are two important ways in which such
decisions may
impair or destroy the authority of common law precedents thought
to have been received in 1975. Firstly a decision post-1975 may
as in <u>Bisket
Uranguae Pokia's</u> case decide that what was thought to be the law in 1975
was not the law at all. Secondly the reasoning in post-1975 decisions in
England and Australia may dispose a court in Papua New Guinea to decide that
the doctrine embodied in earlier English cases and thought
to be the law
received in 1975 is so unjust, anomalous or inconsistent with the trend of
modern authorities in other common law jurisdictions
as to be considered
inapplicable to the circumstances of Papua New Guinea and therefore no longer
in force. As Miles J. suggested
in <u>Vian Guatal's</u> case at p.244 the court
would in that event hold that the discredited doctrine was not part of the
underlying law and then formulate
a new more appropriate rule for Papua New
Guinea based on modern precedents in England, Australia and elsewhere.
<P>

I have no doubt that now more than twenty years after Independence the judges
of the superior courts in Papua New Guinea (the great
majority of whom are
Papua New Guineans) would find very unattractive the notion that they are
obliged to follow a pre-1975 decision
of a foreign court, even the House of
Lords, long abandoned elsewhere. In those circumstances they would in my view
apply the qualifications
referred to in the preceding paragraph and hold either
that the precedent was never good law or that it was inapplicable in Papua
New
Guinea and that a new doctrine should be developed in its place. In this task
they would readily consult and if considered appropriate
then apply post-1975
authorities from England, Australia and other common law jurisdictions.
<P>

This is the approach Papua New Guinea courts are likely to take in considering
foreign precedents including English precedents.
It is to be noted that The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> provides in s.158(2) that "in interpreting the law the courts
shall give paramount consideration to the dispensation of justice"
and the term
"law" is defined in Schedule 1 as including the underlying law." 
<P>

132  	I think the principal point of relevance of those legal
analyses lies in the view this Court should take of the applicability
of the
principles applied by the majority decision of the High Court of Australia in
<b>Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v McNiece Bros Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR
107.</a> After referring to a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on modifying
the application of the privity of contract doctrine, O'Regan
QC expressed the
following opinion:
<P>

"I think a court in Papua New Guinea would take account of all these
developments in common law jurisdictions throughout the Commonwealth.
It would
in my view find the reasoning in <u>Trident</u> particularly persuasive and
note the capacity of the strict rule of privity to work injustice by denying
effect to the common intention
of the contracting parties to benefit others.
See especially the remarks of Mason C.J. and Wilson J. at pp. 121, 122 of their
joint
judgment.
<P>

It would be very likely to hold that this rule, at least in the public
liability insurance context, is not now applicable to the
circumstances of
Papua New Guinea and should not be applied. Instead acting under Schedule 2.3
to The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> it would fashion an appropriate rule for Papua New Guinea
based upon the legislation and case law of other common law countries which
have abrogated the privity rule or substantially mitigated its unjust and
anomalous effects.
<P>

As I stated in my Opinion concerning reception of the common law the Papua New
Guinea courts do not slavishly follow pre-Independence
decisions of the courts
in England, even decisions of the House of Lords. They refer to precedents in
other common law jurisdictions
as well as England and apply those which in
their view contains a formulation of the common law most appropriate for
application
in their country.
<P>

The result of this in the instant case would be that the court would follow
<u>Trident</u> and hold that (Dyno) as an "insured" under the policy would be
entitled to enforce an indemnity."
<P>

133  	The difficulty I have in giving effect to that opinion, the
reasoning of which I find attractive, lies in the invitation to
state what a
court in Papua New Guinea would decide in construing the enforceability of the
endorsed policy by an unnamed insured
by having regard to what was the likely
approach of the court to the application of the privity of contract doctrine. I
see that
judicial exercise as being significantly different from stating on the
basis of expert evidence what the law of Papua New Guinea
is in relation to the
principle of privity of contract. The matter is not made any less simple by
recourse to what has occurred in
England in more recent years in grappling with
the commercial unreality of the rigid application of privity of contract
principles
in insurance law. 
<P>

134  	The dilemma is captured in the opinion of the Privy Council in
<b>The Mahkutai</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20650" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 650.</a> In that case the Privy Council was concerned
with the operation of a Himalaya clause in a bill of lading which extended the
carrier's
benefit of "exemptions, limitations, provision, conditions and
liberties" to "every servant, agent or subcontractor of the carrier
... as if
such provisions had been expressly made for their benefit". 
<P>

135  	In construing that clause, their Lordships considered the
leading judgment of Lord Wilberforce in each of <b>The Eurymedon </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1974/1974_1a.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC
154</a> and <b>The New York Star</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 WLR 138</a> in which the Privy Council
was concerned with the operation of a like clause and held stevedores to be
entitled, in each case, to
the benefit of it. In each case the efficacy of the
Himalaya clause for the benefit of third parties was supported by recourse to
the law of principal and agent, by construing the clause as one entered into by
the carrier as agent for the stevedores.
<P>

136  	I have set out below a long extract from the judgment of Lord
Goff of Chieveley in <b>The Mahkutai</b> as I think it represents the modern
approach in English law to the strict application of privity of contract
doctrine where such
an application would defeat the commercial objectives of
the parties: and by as reflecting its discouragement of "a search for fine
distinctions" which would have the effect of defeating those legitimate
commercial objectives. 
<P>

137  	That passage to which I refer begins with a reference to the
judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Wilberforce
in <b>The New
York Star</b> and is in the following terms:
<P>

"The judgment of the Judicial Committee was again given by Lord Wilberforce. In
the course of his judgment, he stressed, at p. 143:
<P>

"It may indeed be said that the significance of <i>Satterthwaite's </i>case lay
not so much in the establishment of any new legal principle, as in the finding
that in the normal situation involving the
employment of stevedores by
carriers, accepted principles enable and require the stevedore to enjoy the
benefit of contractual provisions
in the bill of lading."
<P>

He continued, at p. 144:
<P>

"Although, in each case, there will be room for evidence as to the precise
relationship of carrier and stevedore and as to the practice
at the relevant
port, the decision does not support, and their Lordships would not encourage, a
search for fine distinctions which
would diminish the general applicability, in
the light of established commercial practice, of the principle."
<P>

Lord Wilberforce in particular expressed the Board's approval of the reasoned
analysis of the relevant legal principles in the judgment
of Barwick C.J.,
which in his opinion substantially agreed with, and indeed constituted a
powerful reinforcement of, one of the two
possible bases put forward in the
Board's judgment in <i>The Eurymedon</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1974/1974_1a.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] A.C. 154.</a> In his judgment in
the court below (the High Court of Australia), Barwick C.J. saw no difficulty
in finding that the carrier acted
as the authorised agent of the stevedores in
making an arrangement with the consignor for the protection of the stevedores:
see 
<a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 298</a>, 304-305. By later accepting the bill of lading
the consignee became party to that arrangement. He could not read the clauses
in
the bill of lading as an unaccepted but acceptable offer by the consignor to
the stevedores. However, the consignor and the stevedores
were ad idem through
the carrier's agency, upon the acceptance by the consignor of the bill of
lading, as to the protection the stevedores
should have in the event that they
caused loss of or damage to the consignment. But that consensus lacked
consideration. He continued,
at p. 305:
<P>

"To agree with another that, in the event that the other acts in a particular
way, that other shall be entitled to stated protective
provisions only needs
performance by the doing of the specified act or acts to become a binding
contract. ... The performance of
the act or acts at the one moment satisfied
the test for consideration and enacted the agreed terms."
<P>

Such a contract Barwick C.J. was prepared, with some hesitation, to describe as
a bilateral contract.
<P>

Critique of the Eurymedon principle
<P>

In <i>The New York Star</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 W.L.R. 138</a>, 144, Lord Wilberforce
discouraged "a search for fine distinctions which would diminish the general
applicability, in the light of
established commercial practice, of the
principle." He was there, of course, speaking of the application of the
principle in the
case of stevedores. It has however to be recognised that, so
long as the principle continues to be understood to rest upon an enforceable
contract as between the cargo owners and the stevedores entered into through
the agency of the shipowner, it is inevitable that technical
points of contract
and agency law will continue to be invoked by cargo owners seeking to enforce
tortious remedies against stevedores
and others uninhibited by the exceptions
and limitations in the relevant bill of lading contract. Indeed, in the present
case their
Lordships have seen such an exercise being legitimately undertaken
by Mr. Aikens on behalf of the cargo owners. In this connection
their Lordships
wish to refer to the very helpful consideration of the principle in <i>Palmer
on Bailment</i>, 2nd ed. (1991), at pp. 1610-1625, which reveals many of the
problems which may arise, and refers to a number of cases, both in England
and
in Commonwealth countries, in which the courts have grappled with those
problems. In some cases, notably but by no means exclusively
in England, courts
have felt impelled by the established principles of the law of contract or of
agency to reject the application
of the principle in the particular case before
them. In others, courts have felt free to follow the lead of Lord Wilberforce
in <i>The Eurymedon</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1974/1974_1a.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] A.C. 154</a>, and of Lord Wilberforce and Barwick
C.J. in <i>The New York Star</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 W.L.R. 138</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 Lloyd's Rep.
298</a>, and so to discover the existence of a contract (nowadays a bilateral
contract of the kind identified by Barwick C.J.) in circumstances
in which
lawyers of a previous generation would have been unwilling to do so.
<P>

Nevertheless there can be no doubt of the commercial need of some such
principle as this, and not only in cases concerned with stevedores;
and the
bold step taken by the Privy Council in <i>The Eurymedon</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1974/1974_1a.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] A.C. 154</a>,
and later developed in <i>The New York Star</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 W.L.R. 138</a>, has been
widely welcomed. But it is legitimate to wonder whether that development is yet
complete. Here their Lordships have in
mind not only Lord Wilberforce's
discouragement of fine distinctions, but also the fact that the law is now
approaching the position
where, provided that the bill of lading contract
clearly provides that (for example) independent contractors such as stevedores
are
to have the benefit of exceptions and limitations contained in that
contract, they will be able to enjoy the protection of those
terms as against
the cargo owners. This is because (1) the problem of consideration in these
cases is regarded as having been solved
on the basis that a bilateral agreement
between the stevedores and the cargo owners, entered into through the agency of
the shipowners,
may, though itself unsupported by consideration, be rendered
enforceable by consideration subsequently furnished by the stevedores
in the
form of performance of their duties as stevedores for the shipowners; (2) the
problem of authority from the stevedores to
the shipowners to contract on their
behalf can, in the majority of cases, be solved by recourse to the principle of
ratification;
and (3) consignees of the cargo may be held to be bound on the
principle in <i>Brandt v. Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation
Co. Ltd. </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%201%20KB%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] 1 K.B. 575.</a> Though these solutions are now perceived to be
generally effective for their purpose, their technical nature is all to
apparent;
and the time may well come when, in an appropriate case, it will fall
to be considered whether the courts should take what may legitimately
be
perceived to be the final, and perhaps inevitable, step in this development,
and recognise in these cases a fully-fledged exception
to the doctrine of
privity of contract, thus escaping from all the technicalities with which
courts are now faced in English law.
It is not far from their Lordships' minds
that, if the English courts were minded to take that step, they would be
following in the
footsteps of the Supreme Court of Canada: see <i>London Drugs
Ltd. v. Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2097%20DLR%20%284th%29%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 97 D.L.R. (4th) 261</a>
and, in a different context, the High Court of Australia: see <i>Trident
General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. McNiece Bros. Pty. Ltd.</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 C.L.R.
107.</a> Their Lordships have given consideration to the question whether they
should face up to this question in the present appeal. However,
they have come
to the conclusion that it would not be appropriate for them to do so, first,
because they have not heard argument
specifically directed towards this
fundamental question, and second because, as will become clear in due course,
they are satisfied
that the appeal must in any event be dismissed."
<P>

(at 662-665)
<P>

138  	Just as much as the Privy Council declined to "face up" to the
question of recognising a "fully-fledged exception to the doctrine
of privity
of contract, thus escaping from all the technicalities with which courts are
now faced in English law", I think that it
would be inappropriate for me to
state what the court in Papua New Guinea would decide if it "faced up" to this
question: assuming
that such an exercise is open to me. 
<P>

139  	I think the following may be drawn from <b>The Mahkutai</b>
when considering English authorities on the question of the operation of the
privity of contract doctrine, while not unmindful of
the fact that these
observations were made by the Law Lords sitting as Privy Councillors:
<P>

(1) The rigid application of the privity of contract principles has a potential
to have unacceptable commercial consequences.
<P>

(2) In appropriate cases the court will strive to avoid those consequences and
to give effect to the obvious intention of contracting
parties, by resort to
the concept of principal and agent.
<P>

(3) In such cases, the parties to such a contract would not be encouraged to
"search for fine distinctions which would diminish"
the court's ability to give
effect to the parties' intention. 
<P>

(4) In particular classes of cases, English courts may treat those cases as
falling within an exception to the privity of contract
rule, "thus escaping
from all the technicalities with which courts are now faced in English law".
<P>

140  	Richard Aikens QC (Aikens QC) gave evidence in the Niugini
Insurance case as an expert in English law. He was eminently qualified
to do
so. Presumably, he was the Mr Aikens who appeared on behalf of the cargo owners
in <b>The Mahkutai </b>who was seen as "legitimately" undertaking the task of
invoking "technical points of contract and agency law" to defeat the
application
of agency principles in that case.
<P>

141  	In his opinion of 10 July 1998, Aikens QC offered the following
expert evidence on English law:
<P>

"15. <b><i>The General Rule</i></b>
<P>

For over 100 years before 1975 there had been a "fundamental principle" of the
English law of contract that only a party to a contract
who had provided
consideration could sue on it. The House of Lords confirmed the rule in
<b><i>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge &amp; Co Ltd <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1915/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1915] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1915%5d%20AC%20847" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1915] AC
847</a></i></b><i>.</i> This basic rule has been reaffirmed subsequently ... Since
1975 there has been no change in the basic law, even though the House
of Lords
and the Privy Council have often commented on the problems that the "privity
rule" creates and the artificial means that
have been adopted by courts to
circumvent it. (See: eg. <b><i>Woodar Investments v Wimpey <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] UKHL 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 277</a> at

650 (PC)</a> at 664 - 5 per Lord Goff of Chieveley).</i></b>
<P>

16. <b><i>Evasion of the General Rule</i></b>
<P>

The English Courts have used a variety of methods to evade the <i>"<b>privity
rule"</b>. </i>Two are relevant to the present case. The first method is the
principle of agency; the second is the principle of the "trust" of a
benefit
for a third party. These mechanisms were recognised before 1975 and have been
confirmed as legitimate (in appropriate circumstances)
since then.
<P>

17. <b><i>Agency:</i></b><i> </i>It is a well - established rule of English law
that a person (the principal) may be made a party to a contract by another
person (the
agent) agreeing with the third party (the other party to the
contract) that the principal should be bound to the contract. But there
will be
difficulties in applying agency principles when a contract is made in the first
place between identified parties who are
clearly principals (say A and B) and
the question is whether other, unidentified parties, can adhere to the contract
...
<P>

18. There is a recognised agency mechanism in English law which enables another
party to adhere to a contract that exists between
two identified principals.
The requirements were summarised by <b><i>Lord Reid</i></b><i> </i>in a
celebrated passage in his speech in<i> <b>Midland Silicones Ltd v Scruttons Ltd

19. Those cases all involve attempts by persons who were not originally parties
to a contract to take advantage of terms of the
contract. In the first two
cases they were stevedores who wished to have the benefit of exemption clauses
in bills of lading. In
the last the shipowner, who was not an original party to
the bill of lading (which had been issued by the charterers of the ship),
wished to take advantage of an Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause in the bill of
lading. But this principle has also been evolved in the
context of insurance
contracts, particularly marine insurance. This is clear from a number of cases
in the nineteenth century which
culminate in the House of Lords decision of
<b><i>Boston Fruit Co v British &amp; Foreign Marine Insurance Co  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%20A%20C%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906] A C
336</a></i></b><i>. </i>The correctness of this decision has never been doubted and
it was followed recently in the Court of Appeal (in a case concerning
a
Shipbuilders All Risks type policy) in <b><i>Stone Vickers Ltd v Appledore
Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2</i> <i>Lloyd's Rep 578</a>; see particularly at
584</i></b><i>.</i> The principles were summarised by Colman J in the case
which is regarded in England as the leading modern authority on the question
of
whether a person may claim to be a co - assured under a policy in which it is
clear that unidentified persons <b><i>might be</i></b> regarded as co -
assured: <b><i>National Oilwell (UK) Ltd v Davy Offshore Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 Lloyd's
Rep 582</a>; see the summary at 596 - 7</i></b><i>.</i>
<P>

20. There are four requirements (in English law) that must be fulfilled before
it could be said that Dyno became a party to the
contract in this way.
<P>

(1) In circumstances where there is a contract between A and B, then a third
person (C) could only become a party to that contract
as well if A and B agree.
This agreement would either have to be in the wording of the contract or from
some other, further agreement
between A and B ...
<P>

(2) <b>Secondly </b>there must be a mechanism whereby one party to the contract
can act as the agent of a third party to bind the third party to the contract.
If the named parties to the contract contemplate that another party will be
able to adhere to it through the mechanism of agency,
then this would also have
to be agreed by both named parties. Once again this could either be apparent
from the wording of the contract
itself or from some other agreement between
the two original parties ...
<P>

(3) The <b>third requirement </b>is that the party to the contract (in this
case the named insured) has the <b><i>authority </i></b>of the potential
principal (ie. Dyno, who is the third party that wishes to adhere to the
contract) to bind Dyno to the contract ...
<P>

(4) In principle, if a named insured does not initially have the authority of
the potential adherent to bind it to the contract,
then it could still become
bound if the adherent <b>ratifies </b>the unauthorised act of the named
Insured: <b><i>Boston Fruit Co v British and Foreign Marine Insurance Co
[1906]AC 336</i></b>. But an <b><i>undisclosed </i></b>principal (as opposed to
an unnamed one) may not ratify the act of a previously unauthorised agent:
<b><i>Keighley Maxsted &amp; Co v Durant</i> <i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%20AC%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] AC 240 (House</a> of
Lords)</i></b><i>. </i>Furthermore, the Court of Appeal has now made it clear
that if, on the wording of the policy, a person is <b><i>unidentified or
incapable of being identified </i></b>as a potential principal at the time that
the principal contract is concluded, then such a person cannot subsequently
ratify the contract.
This was held to be so, even if the person falls into a
class of persons that is identified in the contract as being persons that
might
adhere to the contract. The reason given in that case was that the agency
mechanism can only work if it is clear that the contract
contemplates that it
can be adhered to by identified parties or particular persons capable of
identification. <b><i>See: Stone Vickers Ltd v Appledore Ferguson Shipbuilders
Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 Lloyd's Rep 578</a> especially at 584 - 5 per Parker LJ</i></b><i>.
</i>In England if there is an issue about who can sue on a contract of
insurance, then the court will consider extrinsic evidence apart
from the
policy itself to determine whether it was the intention of the principal
insured that another party (who falls within the
general definition of
insureds) should be a party to the insurance. (This point was analysed
extensively in the <b><i>National Oilwells</i> <i>case (supra) at 593 -
6</i></b><i>).</i>
<P>

(5) I should point out that in the <b><i>National Oilwell (UK) case
(supra)</i></b><i>, </i>Colman J stated <i>(<b>at 597</b>) </i>that on the
facts of that case it was unnecessary for him to deal with the position
where:
<P>

<i>"at the time when the contract of insurance was entered into, the alleged co
- assured could not be ascertained as a member of the
class referred to in the
policy, but only qualified for membership at a later stage or where at the time
of the policy it was only
intended to insure all persons in the class or who
might in future qualify as members of the class, although it would have been
impossible
to identify the alleged co - assured as such. These are difficult
points considered in <b>Arnould, Marine Insurance 16 Ed. para 243</b>. I
express no view on whether privity of contract could be established in such
cases".</i>
<P>

The situation contemplated by Colman J was, in fact, the one that had to be
considered by the Court of Appeal in the <b><i>Stone Vickers case
(supra)</i></b><i>. </i>In that case the Plaintiffs, Stone Vickers, were the
suppliers of a propeller to an oceanographic research vessel that was being
built
by the Defendants, Appledore Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd. The Defendants
had declared the risk represented by the shipbuilding project
under a
Shipbuilders All Risks policy in April 1982. But Stone Vickers did not contract
to supply the propeller until mid May 1982.
The Court of Appeal found, as a
fact, that at the time that the declaration was made in April 1982, Stone
Vickers was not contemplated
as a supplier. It also held, as a matter of
construction of the policy documents, that it was not intended that:
<P>

<i>"all sub-contractors, unidentified and incapable of identification at the
time [of the declaration] were automatically covered. It
can only mean that
declarations naming or properly describing sub - contractors would be
accepted". <b>[See page 584 right hand column and page 585 right hand
column].</b></i>
<P>

(6) The Court of Appeal expressly considered whether, on the facts they had
found, Stone Vickers could invoke Lord Reid's analysis
of the "agency
mechanism" so as to become a party to the contract of insurance. It concluded
that this was not possible because the
first two requirements (considered in
(1) to (3) above) were not fulfilled. It therefore found it unnecessary to
consider further
the issues of ratification or consideration. (It was conceded
that Appledore did not have authority from Stone Vickers to contract
on their
behalf at the time that the risk was declared in April 1982). But it follows
from the Court's reasoning that it considered
ratification could only be
invoked to utilise the "agency mechanism" if the contract of insurance made it
clear that it intended
to apply to the <b><i>particular </i></b>sub <i>-
</i>contractor who was nominated after the declaration under the policy was
made.
<P>

(7) This analysis accords with the House of Lords' decision in <b><i>Keighley
Maxted</i> <i>&amp; Co v Durant  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1901%5d%20AC%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1901] AC 240</a> </i></b>that an unauthorised
agent cannot ratify for an undisclosed principal. In <b><i>Boston Fruit Co v
British and Foreign Marine</i> <i>Insurance Co [19061 AC 336 at 343</i></b><i>,
</i>Lord Atkinson pointed out that the doctrine established in marine insurance
cases that an <i>"underwriter </i>... <i>was held</i> <i>to have insured those
whom the person who dealt with him intended should be insured, though that
intention was never communicated
to [the underwriter]" </i>could not long
survive the <b><i>Keighley Maxted </i></b>decision. The issue that is
discussed<i> </i>at<i> <b>para 243 </b></i>of <b><i>Arnould on Marine Insurance
(16 Ed)</i></b> is whether, at the time that the contract of marine insurance
is concluded, it is necessary (i) simply that the agent (ie. the person
named
in the contract, eg the cargo owner/seller) should have intended that anyone
who came within an <b>identified class </b>(eg. buyers of the cargo) could be a
party to the contract; or (ii) that the agent intended <b>a particular person
</b>could become a party to the contract, in either case if the person became
interested in the subject matter of the insurance. <b><i>Arnould (16 Ed
original para 243)</i></b> argues that the wider rule represents English law.
But<b><i> the Stone Vickers case</i> </b>seems to confirm that the narrower
rule represents English law. The Court of Appeal's analysis appears to be
accepted in <b><i>Arnould (16 Ed) volume 3 at para 241 - 2.</i></b>
<P>

(8) The <b>fourth requirement </b>is that consideration must move from the
third party: ie Dyno in this case. The consideration can be in the form of a
benefit to another
or a detriment to Dyno ... In<i> "<b>The</b></i><b>
<i>Mahkutai</i></b><i>" </i>Lord Goff said that when a third person becomes a
party to a contract through an agent, the problem of consideration is "solved"
by
the subsequent performance of the new parties' duties: <b><i>see page 664F
of the</i> <i>report</i></b> ... But in English law the question of whether
consideration has been given will be an issue of fact to be determined at the
trial."
<P>

142  	As a general comment on that evidence, I have some considerable
discomfort with Aikens QC's analysis of <b>Woodar Investments</b>, <b>The
Pioneer Container</b> and <b>The Mahkutai</b> as illustrations of cases in
which "the House of Lords and the Privy Council have often commented on the
problems that the "privity
rule" creates and the <u>artificial means</u> that
have been adopted by courts to circumvent it". (emphasis added)
<P>

143  	Rather than regarding the means invoked by recourse to
principles of agency as being artificial, it seems to me to be clear
from the
authorities to which I have been referred by Aikens QC, that any artificiality
lies in the "fine distinctions", to adopt
Lord Wilberforce's phrase, and the
"technical points of contract and agency law", to adopt Lord Goff's phrase,
invoked to avoid the
application of principles of agency for the benefit of
third party contracts.
<P>

144  	I think the heading, "Evasion of the General Rule" by which
Aikens QC introduced his analysis of the application in English
law of the
privity of contract doctrine, illustrates a conceptual approach which I think
is at odds with those cases. 
<P>

145  	I would contrast Aikens QC's paraphrasing of those decisions
with what Lord Goff said in <b>The Mahkutai </b>which I repeat for convenience
of reference:
<P>

"Here their Lordships have in mind not only Lord Wilberforce's discouragement
of fine distinctions, but also the fact that the law
is now approaching the
position where, provided that the bill of lading contract clearly provides that
(for example) independent
contractors such as stevedores are to have the
benefit of exceptions and limitations contained in that contract, they will be
able
to enjoy the protection of those terms as against the cargo owners."
<P>

I see nothing artificial in that approach.
<P>

146  	The second matter of significant difficulty that I have in
accepting the analysis of Aikens QC, lies in his resort to <b>Stone Vickers</b>
for the propositions referred to in the passages from his opinion evidence
quoted above. The decision of <b>Stone Vickers</b>, in my view, is of very
little, if any, assistance in resolving the construction issues raised in these
proceedings. The matters
in respect of which Aikens QC cites <b>Stone
Vickers</b> must be read in the context of the facts and the terms of the
policy under consideration in <b>Stone Vickers </b>and which, I think, are
significantly different from the facts of this case and the terms of the
endorsed policy. 
<P>

147  	In <b>Stone Vickers</b>,<b> </b>the respondent Appledore
Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd is referred to in the judgment as AS. It was a
subsidiary of British Shipbuilders
Ltd, which is referred to in the judgment as
BS. The insurance provision with which Stone Vickers was concerned, is set out
in the
judgment of Lord Justice Parker, as follows:
<P>

"At all material times AS was a subsidiary of British Shipbuilders Ltd. (BS).
That company had many other subsidiary or associated
or member companies which
were separately insured under different policies but it desired to cover all
insurance protection which
it required for itself and its subsidiary and
associated and member companies by means of one open cover policy and
declarations
thereunder.
<P>

Prior to the date of the main contract this objective had not yet been achieved
and there were in force two relevant open covers.
The first of these was a BS
open cover for the period Nov. 1, 1981 to Mar. 31, 1983 sometimes referred to
as the B.S. Marine Contract
or Package Policy 1981-83. The immediately relevant
provisions of this policy were:
<P>

<u>ASSURED</u> British Shipbuilders their Associated Subsidiary and Member
Companies and/or as required by contract for their respective rights
and
interests as attached ...
<P>

<u>ON</u> (A) CONSTRUCTION and/or COVERSION RISKS and/or BUILDERS INTEREST in
respect of vessels ... and/or any interests as may be declared.
<P>

Declarations hereunder ... to be agreed by Leading Lloyd's Underwriter and the
Leading Company Underwriter and to be binding on
all remaining Underwriters
hereon.
<P>

The second open cover was an AS open cover (Policy No. MN10025A) covering the
same period as the BS open cover last mentioned, the
immediately relevant terms
of which were:
<P>

ASSURED:
<P>

This Policy insures Appledore Shipbuilders Ltd. and/or Appledore Shiprepairers
Ltd. and/or British Shipbuilders Ltd. for their respective
rights and interests
and liabilities hereinafter referred to as the "Assured".
<P>

Agreed include Associated and Subsidiary Companies and/or Sub-Contractors as
additional Co-assured for their respective rights and
interests. Without
recourse against any Co-assured.
<P>

It is further agreed that, in respect of additional (Co-)Assured named or
referred to herein, this Policy will discharge any liability
that it would bear
if each of the Assured named or referred to herein was separately insured and
in the event of any act or omission
on the part of one Assured in respect of
which Underwriters exercise their right to avoid the Policy the remaining
Assured (including
those named in the first paragraph of this Clause) for whom
this Policy remains in full force shall not be prejudiced thereby.
<P>

This policy also dealt inter alia with construction risks and incorporated
certain sets of standard clauses to which I shall later
return.
<P>

On Apr. 7, 1982 A.S. made a declaration in respect of the construction of the
<i>Charles Darwin</i> (also known as A.S. 138) which was duly presented to and
accepted by underwriters. As so accepted it was in the following terms:
<P>

<center><b><u>BRITISH SHIPBUILDERS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>MARINE CONTRACT 1981 - 1983</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>APPLEDORE SHIPBUILDERS LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>POLICY NO. MN 10025</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SECTION (A) - CONSTRUCTION</u></b>
<P>

Agreed accept:</center>
<P>

<u>ASSURED</u> APPLEDORE SHIPBUILDERS LIMITED and/or BRITISH SHIPBUILDERS
NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COUNCIL and/or MORGAN GRENFELL LIMITED
for their
respective rights and interest.
<P>

<u>VESSEL</u> No. AS 138 (Oceanographic Research Vessel)
<P>

<u>PERIOD</u> To be advised (Commencement of erection March 1983-
<P>

Delivery February 1984)
<P>

...
<P>

As to the declaration the Judge observed:
<P>

It was ... made and accepted by underwriters under Policy MN10025 in relation
to Section A as contemplated by and provided for in
the BS Marine Contract or
Package Policy for 1981-83.
<P>

The BS open cover, the AS policy MN10025A and the accepted declaration are the
foundation of SV's claim to have been co-assured."

<P>

(at 581-582)
<P>

148  	SV was the respondent<b> </b>Stone Vickers which had contracted
with Appledore as subcontractor for the supply to Appledore of a single screw
controllable pitch
propeller and ancillary equipment in connection with the
shipbuilding contract the subject of the Appledore declaration of 7 April
1982.
That contract was dated 8 April 1982. Stone Vickers did not tender for the
subcontract works until 19 April 1982 and on 17
May 1982 its tender was
accepted. The subcontract contained cross indemnity provisions but no provision
requiring Appledore to effect
any insurance on behalf of Stone Vickers. 
<P>

149  	In dealing with the question whether Stone Vickers was a
co-assured, Parker LJ expressed the following reasons for concluding
that it
was not an insured under the AS policy as follows:
<P>

"Were SV co-assured?
<P>

This is, as I have said, the crucial question because, if they were not, the
appeal must succeed. I approach this question, first,
as a matter of
construction.
<P>

In Boston Fruit Company v. British and Foreign Marine Insurance Co.,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%20AC%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906]
A.C. 336</a>, the appellants had chartered a vessel from owners who had taken out
an insurance on it - 
<P>

... as well as in their own name as for and in the names of all and every other
person or persons to whom the subject matter of
this policy shall appertain in
part or in all.
<P>

The policy contained a collision clause. The appellants having had to pay
damages to the owners of another vessel in respect of
a collision with the
insured vessel sought to recover from the insurers. The charter-party provided
that the owners should pay for
insurance on the vessel. It was held that the
appellants were not entitled to sue on the policy. Dealing with the question of
the
intention of the owners at the time of effecting the policy Lord Macnaghten
said at pp. 340-341: 
<P>

There is not the slightest evidence of intention on the part of the owners to
protect the charterers by insurance unless such intention
can be inferred from
the mere fact of the existence of the policy taken in connection with the
language of the charter ... it seems
to me that the conclusion must be that
when the owners proposed to insure, acting as they did without any
communication with the
charterers, the charterers cannot be regarded as persons
within the contemplation of the proposal.
<P>

It is clear from that case that for the purposes of ascertaining intention one
may look not only at the policy documents but also
at the contract between the
assured and the alleged co-assured.
<P>

In the present case (i) there was no communication with regard to insurance
between AS and SV either prior to the BS main contract,
the AS policy MN10025A,
or the declaration expressly made under both those documents, or indeed at any
material time thereafter;
(ii) whatever may have been expected or intended as
to SV becoming the sub-contractor for the propeller it was uncertain whether
they would be such. They had not yet tendered at the time the declaration was
agreed and accepted by underwriters; (iii) the main
contract did not provide
that SV should be sub-contractors for the propeller; (iv) the sub-contract when
entered into did not provide
for AS to insure in the joint names of themselves
and SV; (v) SV insured for the benefit of AS with specific mention of the
liability
under the reciprocal indemnity clause. All these matters together
with the guarantee and defects liability clause are in my judgment
inconsistent
with any intention on the part of AS to insure for the benefit of SV
<P>

As to the insurance documents themselves:
<P>

(i) BS Marine Contract 1981 - 1983 included, outside BS and their subsidiary,
associated and member companies only such other parties
required by contract.
There was no contractual requirement to include SV
<P>

(ii) Policy No. MN10025A names as assured only AS and/or Appledore Ship Repairs
Ltd. and/or BS for their respective rights and interests.
<P>

The words following: 
<P>

... agreed include Associated and Subsidiary Companies and/or Sub-contractors
as additional co-assured for their respective interests
...
<P>

cannot in my judgment mean that all sub-contractors unidentified and incapable
of identification at the time were automatically
covered. It can only mean that
declarations naming or properly describing sub-contractors would be
accepted.
<P>

(iii) The following provisions of MN10025A indicate that sub-contractors in
general were not intended to be covered.
<P>

(a) <i>General Condition 4</i> 
<P>

Main Engines and/or other interests built by members of BS insured hereunder
when attaching from delivery to Shipyard monthly rate
only to apply.
<P>

(b) Section I. Construction Risks. Clause 11:
<P>

OUTSTANDING TO SUB-CONTRACTORS IF TOTAL LOSS: 
<P>

It is understood and agreed that where component parts scheduled for inclusion
in the completed Vessel are being build by Sub-Contractors,
then, in the event
of a claim for Total Loss of the building at the main contractor's yard being
settled, Underwriters will indemnify
Sub-Contractors of component parts up to
the value of these parts.
<P>

(iv) The declaration of Apr. 7 named as assured only AS, BS, NERC and Morgan
Grenfell Ltd. There was no mention of Appledore Ship
Repairers Ltd., who were
named in policy MN10025A or of any specific sub-contractor or class of
sub-contractors.
<P>

(v) Read as a whole, including the incorporated clauses, the policy was not
intended to cover and did not cover losses or expenses
arising from the
rectification of design faults.
<P>

In the light of all the above matters I conclude that as a matter of
construction SV were not intended to have and did not therefore
have the
benefit of the AS insurance and were not co-assured."
<P>

(at 584-585)
<P>

150  	Of that decision I observe that the subject policy was an open
policy: it purported to cover the named insured and a group
of unidentified
"associated and subsidiary companies of the named insured and/or
Sub-Contractors" presumably of each or all of those
named and unspecified
companies. 
<P>

151  	Further, the insured identified in the declaration made under
the policy was identified as Appledore and two other entities,
referred to
respectively as Research Council and Morgan Grenfell Ltd. At the time of the
inception of the policy, one assumes that
the subject shipbuilding contract was
not in contemplation and further that at the time of the declaration under the
policy, Stone
Vickers was not in contemplation. Those circumstances are to be
distinguished from project-specific, contractors' all risks policy
and
operational all risks policy entered into, in the case of the endorsed policy,
at a time when the named insured was under a contractual
obligation to effect
the cl 15.2 insurance indemnifying Dyno as contractor and supplier under the
contract. I think that was so under
the 1992 extended cover, and it was
certainly so, in my view, under the 1994 endorsement. 
<P>

152  	<b>Stone Vickers, </b>I think, may be safely left to rest with
its special facts. 
<P>

153  	In my view, the four requirements for the enforcement of the
endorsed policy by Dyno as identified by Aikens QC, are satisfied,
by the terms
of the endorsed policy and those of the Dyno contract, in particular, the
obligation of Placer under that contract to
effect the cl 15.2 insurance. No
question of ratification, as discussed by Aikens QC, arises.
<P>

154  	In reaching that conclusion by recourse to the terms of the
Dyno contract, I note in the quoted passage from the judgment
of Parker LJ in
<b>Stone Vickers</b> his Lordship's reliance upon <b>Boston Fruit Co v British
and Foreign Marine Insurance Co</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%20AC%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906] AC 336</a> as authority for the
proposition that "for the purposes of ascertaining intention (of the named
insured to effect insurance on behalf
of the third party) one may look not only
at the policy documents but also at the contract between the assured and the
alleged co-assured."
<P>

155  	In this case, I also have the benefit of the evidence of John
Bagnall, who was company secretary and in-house counsel for
Dyno in 1992, to
the effect that, in negotiations leading up to the execution of the Dyno
contract and in discussions immediately
preceding the inception of the 1992
extended cover, it was clearly understood that the PJV would "have their
insurance cover also
protect Dyno's interests and risk of the operation" to
avoid duplication of cover. I think there is very little room for conjecture
as
to the intention of Dyno and the PJV that Dyno was to be covered by the
endorsed policy. I do not understand there to be any serious
question
concerning the insurable interest of Dyno. The policy provided for an indemnity
in respect of the respective interests of
the insured in relation to the
project. The authorities, as explained by Aikens QC, clearly demonstrate the
"pervasive interest"
each of the insured had in the project and in particular
the insured property.
<P>

156  	Objection had been taken to the evidence of Alfred John Steeden
(Steeden)<b> </b>by Niugini Insurance on the basis that his evidence did not go
to any issue between Dyno and Niugini Insurance. I can find no record
where
that objection was disposed of, although I had given an indication as to its
admissibility. As to the objection to the whole
of the statement, that cannot
be sustained as the material referred to below, in my view, is admissible and
relevant to the commercial
nature of a contractors all risks policy. 
<P>

157  	Steeden had been involved in the insurance industry for over
fifty years, initially being involved in the London broker market.
He came to
Australia in 1971 and obtained prominence in the broking industry. He described
the commercial background to the contract
works insurance as follows:
<P>

"Contract works insurance came into the London insurance market in about the
late 1930s when the British Institute of Architects
recommended to their
members that building contracts should contain clauses requiring all parties to
be jointly covered against physical
loss or damage to contract works. The
advantage of this type of insurance was that all contractors and subcontractors
on site could
be covered by the same policy and any claims under that policy
would only have to be adjusted once rather than involving a multiplicity
of
insurers in each claim. The complications caused by having more than one
insurer is that the terms and conditions of each of the
policies may differ and
excesses may vary. It also has the effect of having multiple loss adjusters
involved in such claims. The
policies were most often used in large civil
engineering projects where a number of contractors and/or subcontractors could
be involved
and it is common practice for the Principal in such projects to
arrange insurance in one policy on behalf of all parties on site."
<P>

158  	I find utility in that material as evidencing the nature of the
benefit to both insured and insurer in a specific project
contract works policy
which, in my view, lends weight to the commercial objective of the parties to
the policy and the endorsed policy,
and is consistent with the imputation of an
intention of the PJV to act as agent for Dyno in effecting the endorsed
policy.
<P>

159  	Where one has a contractors all risks policy, and in this case
combined with an operational all risks policy, for a specific
project, for a
defined time, expressed to cover named insured and others by characterising
them as contractors or suppliers to the
named insured, the intention is plain
that the policy cover contemplated is for the benefit of those satisfying that
description
engaged from time to time in the project in the manner defined. 
<P>

160  	Where that policy is effected pursuant to a contractual
obligation to the contractor or supplier to insure, as is the case
of the
endorsed policy, then no question of ratification, in my view, arises, nor any
question as to the authority of the named insured
to act as agent for the
unnamed insured in effecting that policy. The necessary consideration to
support such a contract of insurance
on behalf of an unnamed insured is to be
found in the terms and performance of the Dyno contract by Dyno.
<P>

161  	I have not found it necessary to consider the application of
the trust mechanism as a means for enforcement of the endorsed
policy for the
benefit of Dyno, nor the application of the principles relating to the
enforcement of contracts for the benefit of
third parties as expressed in
<b>Beswick v Beswick</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1967/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20AC%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] AC 58.</a> I prefer not to express any view on
those two avenues of enforcement of the endorsed policy in favour of Dyno other
than to observe
that <b>Beswick</b> was concerned with the specific enforcement
of a promise to pay a sum certain to a specific person, who was not a party to
the subject
agreement. I have been referred to no authority where <b>Beswick
</b>has been applied in obtaining specific performance of an indemnity in
favour of an unnamed beneficiary of the indemnity. 
<P>

162  	It then remains to be considered whether the PJV, really
Niugini Insurance, may bring the subrogation claim against Dyno.
Clearly, in my
view, it may not. I think that result flows from the authorities cited by
Aikens QC and, in particular, from <b>Petrofina (UK) Ltd v Magnaload Ltd
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20QB%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 QB 127</a> at 140. Lloyd J, in that case, expressed the principle as
being based on a concept of circuity of action which his Honour considered
in
the following way:
<P>

"That brings me to the last question: does the fact that the defendants are
fully insured under the present policy defeat the insurer's
right of
subrogation? In the <i>Commonwealth Construction Co.</i> case and in the
American cases there referred to, it was assumed that it followed automatically
that the insurers could have no right
of subrogation. In the <i>Commonwealth
Construction Co. </i>case it was described as being a "basic principle." In one
of the American cases it was said that the rule was too well established
to
require citation. In none of the cases is there any discussion as to the reason
for the rule, except for a brief reference in
the <i>Commonwealth Construction
Co.</i> case to <i>Simpson and Co. v. Thomson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%203%20AC%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) 3 App. Cas. 279</a> as
follows, at p. 561:
<P>

"The starting point of that submission is the basic principle that subrogation
cannot be obtained against the insured himself. The
classic example is, of
course, to be found in S<i>impson and Co. v. Thomson</i>, 3 App.Cas. 279. In
the case of true joint insurance, there is, of course, no problem; the
interests of the joint insured are so
inseparably connected that the several
insureds are to be considered as one with the obvious result that subrogation
is impossible.
In the case of several insurance, if the different interests are
pervasive and if each relates to the entire property, albeit from
different
angles, again there is no question that the several insureds must be regarded
as one and that no subrogation is possible."
<P>

The question whether there is a fundamental principle of the law of insurance
that insurers can never sue one co-insured in the
name of another came up in
<i>The Yasin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 45.</a> In that case I said that I was not
satisfied that there was any such fundamental principle as had been suggested:
the reason for
the rule seemed to me to rest on ordinary principles of
circuity. This idea has since been adopted by the current editors of
<i>MacGillivray &amp; Parkington on Insurance Law</i>, 7th ed. (1981), para.
1214. In paragraph 1215 the editors say:
<P>

"The crucial question, therefore, in any case involving joint assured is
whether the liability of one co-assured to the other is
one of the matters
covered by the policy."
<P>

Thus where a bailee is insured against liability to the bailor, and the bailor
is insured under the same insurance, it is obvious
that the insurer could not
exercise a right of subrogation against the bailee: circuity would be a
complete answer. But in <i>The Yasin</i> I went on to contrast the position
where the bailee had insured, not his liability to the bailor, but the goods
themselves. Now that
the matter has been argued again, I have come to the
conclusion that the contrast I was seeking to draw is fallacious. Whatever be
the reason why an insurer cannot sue one co-insured in the name of another, and
I am still inclined to think that the reason is circuity,
it seems to me now
that it must apply equally in every case of bailment, whether it is the goods
which the bailee has insured, or
his liability in respect of the goods. The
same would also apply in the case of contractors and sub-contractors engaged on
a common
enterprise under a building or engineering contract. Even if I still
had reservations of the kind which I tried to voice in <i>The Yasin</i>, I
would feel obliged to bury them in the light of the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in the <i>Commonwealth Construction Co.</i> case, a decision
which was not cited in <i>The Yasin</i> and for the reference to which in the
present case I am very grateful to counsel."
<P>

(at 139-140)
<P>

163  	In <b>National Oilwell (UK) Ltd v Davy Offshore Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993]
2 Lloyd's Rep. 582</a>, Colman J preferred to uphold a defence to a subrogation
action against a co-assured on the basis of an implied term in the policy
of
insurance. The difficulty I have with these decisions is that as matters of
strict pleading go, on the face of pleadings in a
subrogation action, there
would be no issue raised as to the identity of the true plaintiff and the
concept of circuity, while a
practical basis for resisting a claim in
subrogation against a co-assured, is not readily expressed in terms of legal
principle.
However that may be, the English authorities, I think, are clear to
the effect that such a claim by way of subrogation against a
co-assured will be
defeated either on grounds of circuity of action or as being brought in breach
of an implied or express term of
the underlying policy of insurance.
<P>

164  	In this case there exists a promise on the part of Placer to
effect the cl 15.2 insurance on behalf of Dyno. The bringing
of a subrogation
claim by PJV against Dyno as a co-insured would appear to run counter to that
obligation under the Dyno contract.
However, I prefer not to dispose of the
subrogation claim on the basis that it is one brought in breach of any implied
obligation
of Placer under the Dyno contract. I reject the subrogation claim as
one involving a circuity of action or, alternatively, as one
brought in breach
of the terms of the endorsed policy. As to those terms, it is noted that, in
relation to the Section II cover,
the cross-liability clause earlier quoted
provided that Niugini Insurance waived all rights of subrogation which it may
have or acquire
against any of the insured parties.
<P>

165  	Before examining the quantum issues, it is preferable, I think,
to dispose of some threshold insurance questions raised by
Niugini Insurance
against the claims by Dyno under Sections I and II of the policy. It is Niugini
Insurance's case that, if Dyno
is an insured under the policy, Niugini
Insurance was entitled to, and did, avoid the policy for material
non-disclosure as notified
by letter of 5 April 1995 which was in the following
terms: 
<P>

<b>"Contract Works Policy - Porgera Joint Venture</b>
<P>

<b>Your Client - Dyno Wesfarmers Limited</b>
<P>

We refer to your facsimile dated 27 March 1995.
<P>

While not in any way limiting the grounds upon which we may rely in the event
of litigation we now advise that the following are
the major reasons for our
client's decision to reject all claims by your client:
<P>

1. Our client maintains that your client is not an insured under its policy.
<P>

2. Even if your client were insured under the policy (which is denied):-
<P>

(a) Your client undertook an increase in risk that was not contemplated 
<P>

by the policy due to processing of explosives on site and doing so in a
dangerous and unlawful manner; and 
<P>

(b) Your client has been in breach of the due care clause;
<P>

3. As mentioned above our client denies that your client is an insured under
its policy. Even if your client were considered an
insured (which is denied)
our client would by this letter avoid the policy as against your client only,
on the grounds of lack of
good faith and material non-disclosure of risk as our
client was not aware that your client was processing explosives on site.
<P>

We do not intend to correspond with you further on this matter and we confirm
that any proceedings issued by your client will be
strenuously defended to
trial."
<P>

166  	I doubt if anything turns on the distinction drawn in that
letter between a non-disclosure of an increased risk and material
non-disclosure of a risk other than in terms of the construction placed on the
policy, the 1992 endorsement and the 1994 endorsement.
In each case the central
basis for the avoidance lies in the risk associated with the conduct of
explosives processing on-site. It
was not a distinction pressed in final
submissions on behalf of Niugini Insurance. 
<P>

167  	What the distinction does emphasise is the primary position
taken by Niugini Insurance that the policy did not respond to
risks associated
with the manufacture and storage on site of explosives: the policy being a
"contract works policy." Pars 10 and
11 of Niugini Insurance's contentions in
its defence to the second cross-claim are in the following terms: 
<P>

"10. In further answer to the whole of Dyno's claim, NIC says that if (which is
denied) Dyno was entitled to be indemnified under
the Insurance policy, NIC was
entitled to and has avoided the Insurance Policy as against Dyno by reason of
material non-disclosure,
namely the failure to disclose to NIC the fact that
Dyno was manufacturing and assembling and/or storing bulk and/or cap-sensitive
explosives and detonators in close proximity on a remote site in Papua Niugini
using primarily national unskilled labour.
<P>

11. In further answer to the whole of Dyno's claim, NIC says that if (which is
denied) Dyno was a party entitled to be indemnified
under the Insurance Policy,
NIC is not liable to indemnify Dyno, because Dyno's activities as referred to
in the foregoing paragraph
materially and substantially altered the risk from
that which was insured under the Insurance Policy."
<P>

168  	As stated earlier in these reasons, I regard Niugini
Insurance's construction of the endorsed policy, upon which that defence
is
founded, as erroneous. That approach to the policy is, in my view, the key to
the resolution of the "non-disclosure" insurance
issues in these proceedings.

<P>

169  	Niugini Insurance has concentrated on Dyno's operation on site
by comparison with that of ICI as conducted up to 15 November
1992. That
approach tends to cloak the significance of the failure of Niugini Insurance to
appreciate that the endorsed policy included
an operational all risks cover
which, by its terms, covered the operation of the explosives plant. 
<P>

170  	It is common ground that Niugini Insurance was aware that an
explosives facility of some kind was on site. I do not understand
it to be
disputed that, had it been appreciated by Niugini Insurance that the endorsed
policy covered the risk associated with the
explosives supply operation on
site, the assessment of that risk would have been referred to the Property and
Fire department of
Munich Re. That is the clear effect of the evidence. Whether
"the processing of explosives on site" was that conducted by ICI or
Dyno,
disclosure of the risk associated with that operation was clearly material to
any determination by Niugini Insurance to grant
or continue to provide cover
under the policy, or more particularly, the endorsed policy. 
<P>

171  	It is useful, I think, to approach the non-disclosure issue
through Niugini Insurance's case that Dyno's operation represented
an increased
risk when compared with the pre-15 November 1992 operation of ICI.
<P>

172  	Niugini Insurance identified eight changes in the operations of
Dyno when compared with those of ICI, namely:
<P>

(1) There was a change in the form of explosives from Amex series to ANFO which
were mixed on site. It is not suggested that that
represented a material
change.
<P>

(2) The presence on the site of an emulsion plant and the preparation of
emulsion on site was not reflected in any part of the ICI
operation.
<P>

(3) The presence on the site of the emulite plant and the preparation of
emulite on site was not matched by anything performed by
ICI.
<P>

(4) Similarly, the nonel detonator plant and preparation of detonators on site
formed no part of ICI's operation.
<P>

(5) Matrix was pumped into a mixer into which a sensitiser was added by ICI at
the plant to produce powergel, while Dyno carried
out a similar operation, at
the mine face in the production of DP 400.
<P>

(6) There was difference in the volume of emulsion and related material, such
as fuel phase and AN liquor, stored or used on site
under the operations of ICI
and Dyno.
<P>

(7) Dyno introduced two steam generators to the site.
<P>

(8) Dyno's workforce was larger than that of ICI.
<P>

173  	Niugini Insurance conceded that the change referred to in
paragraph 1 was not material and submitted that there was no material
difference in the nature of the operations referred to in paragraph 5. However,
in respect of the latter activity, I think the evidence
disclosed that the
performance of that operation at the plant by ICI carried a greater risk than
Dyno's mixing of the DP 400 at the
mine face in the mobile mixer. 
<P>

174  	The matters of difference referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8, I
think, were inconsequential. The assembling of detonators involved
a
comparatively simple attachment of a tube and plug by crimping. The
significance of the separation distance of this plant from
the explosives plant
is examined elsewhere in these reasons. As to paragraph 6, the evidence
established that, towards the end of
the ICI contract, there was a considerable
volume of emulsion stored on site in the vicinity of the plant. At the same
time it had
not been necessary for ICI to store AN liquor and fuel phase which
Dyno had as part of its operation. 
<P>

175  	It is Niugini Insurance's case that there was a greater
quantity of emulsion and related materials stored by Dyno in the vicinity
of
the plant when compared with the storage of like material under the ICI
operation. I am far from satisfied that that is the case.
The evidence of Hood
was that, towards the end of the ICI contract, one month's emulsion requirement
was stored on site, consisting
of about 400 to 500 tonnes, compared with 100
tonnes stored by Dyno. 
<P>

176  	During cross-examination, Hood confirmed this evidence in the
following way:
<P>

"A. ... When the ICI contract finished, we had four or 500 tonnes of emulsion
phase on site. With the increase in operations - with
the increased scale of
operations that were going to happen in the open pit we would have had to
increase the storage area and the
amount of emulsion phase that was stored on
site considerably, so, by manufacturing the emulsion phase on site we were able
to keep
the amount that we had to store on site at any one time at a maximum of
90 to 100 tonnes.
<P>

Q. When you say "increased considerably", that is four to 500 tonnes, is it?
<P>

A. Sorry, in my answer that I have just made to you?
<P>

Q. Yes.
<P>

A. Yes, that's correct.
<P>

Q. When you say increased considerably to what approximate amount?
<P>

A. At the time, I suppose we were mining about 60 to 70,000 tonnes a day in the
open pit - I can't remember the exact figures -
and we were going to go up to
140 or more thousand tonnes a day, so we might have had to double that figure
to maintain our inventory
levels."
<P>

(T145.38-146.6)
<P>

177  	PC Smith's evidence in cross-examination confirmed the
correctness of information given by him to Harry Douglas (Douglas),
a
consultant, who had been retained by Niugini Insurance's loss assessor and to
whom PC Smith reported on 18 October 1994. Part of
Douglas' retainer was to
make an assessment "whether the risk of an explosion of similar consequences
(to that of 2 August 1994)
would have been likely during ICI's contract period
for the supply of explosives to the Porgera Joint Venture". As a preface to his
report, he made the following observation:
<P>

"As the manufacturing site used by ICI was basically the same as that used by
(Dyno) on 2 August 1994, the consequences of a detonation,
assessed from
quantity/distance criteria, are common and therefore the risk exposures (viz
the product function of accident rate,
the probability of detonation and the
consequence of detonation) are more readily compared."
<P>

178  	Douglas had been selected on behalf of Niugini Insurance for
his pre-eminence in the field. He had a long and impressive history
in relation
to the use of explosives in association with mining, spending most of his
professional life as an employee in the Western
Australian Department of Mines:
for fifteen years as a chemist and research officer - his formal qualifications
were in chemistry
- and for the remaining twenty-four years in turn as
inspector, deputy chief inspector, and as chief inspector and director of
explosives
and dangerous goods. For some nine years after leaving the
department he had operated a consultancy business specialising in advice
on
explosives, and possessing accreditation by New South Wales and Western
Australian governments as such an expert.
<P>

179  	His report is particularly significant, I think, by reason of
the fact that it was the result of a retainer on behalf of Niugini
Insurance
effected at a time close to the event. As part of the process in preparing his
report, Douglas interviewed various representatives
of Dyno, including IT
Smith, and obtained details of the Dyno operation. He carried out a similar
interview process with representatives
of ICI, including PC Smith. His notes of
the latter interview disclose much of what I have earlier outlined about the
use of materials
by ICI under its contract with the PJV. 
<P>

180  	In relation to the storage of matrix by ICI, he noted as
follows:
<P>

"ISO tanks (20 tonne capacity) were used for the transport and storage of EP
Gold ... Five of these tanks were normally stored at
the manufacturing plant
(that is at the ICI explosives plant). (At the end of the ICI contract 12 to 13
ISO tanks had accumulated
due to on-going supplies of the delivery
contract)."
<P>

181  	When questioned about Douglas' report on this aspect, PC Smith
gave the following evidence:
<P>

"Q. On the bottom of page 18 of his report he refers to the storage of matrix
in 20 tonne capacity iso-tanks. He says five of those
tanks were normally
stored at the manufacturing plant but at the end of the ICI contract 12 to 13
iso-tanks had accumulated?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. In your statement I think you refer to the fact that there was an increase
in storage towards the end of the contract period?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Can we assume that matrix was stored in the 12 to 13 iso-tanks that were
referred to?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. So the total matrix storage which may have taken place up until November
1992 could have been 12 - could have been almost 250
tonnes of matrix stored at
the plant?
<P>

A. At the end of the ICI contract it was of that order, yes.
<P>

Q. I take it that the increased storage of matrix was caused by an increase in
the requirements of the PJV for product?
<P>

A. Well, it was caused by an increase in their forecast requirements. In fact
they didn't - they weren't using it at the rate they
had forecast. That
resulted in the build-up.
<P>

Q. If one was making a comparison of these two operations, the ability of Dyno
to manufacture matrix on site was something which
was obviously different to
the capabilities that ICI had?
<P>

A. Well, yes, certainly.
<P>

Q. The emulsion was the fundamental or was a fundamental component of the final
product?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. If one was to meet the needs of the PJV for explosives, it was necessary to
have the relevant quantity of matrix on site at all
times?
<P>

A. Well, that was - yes, that was our obligation to do that based on their
forecast.
<P>

...
<P>

Q. If one was to assume that by October - sorry, by August 1994, the
requirements of the PJV was four times the requirements as
at November 1992 we
can assume that it may have been necessary for ICI to have had up to four times
the amount of matrix it had on
site at November 1992?
<P>

A. Well, the assumption is sort of false, really, because above a certain level
of usage ICI would invariably put a manufacturing
facility in themselves. The
economics of putting in a manufacturing plant for small quantities doesn't sort
of - it doesn't justify
it. If the quantities were going to get bigger and
bigger and bigger, then the probability is that ICI might have put in a
manufacturing
plant to provide it. In other words, I think it is unlikely that
we would have stored there four times the quantity."
<P>

(T 1556.26 - 1558.7)
<P>

182  	He gave further evidence in re-examination as follows:
<P>

"MR FORSTER: Q. You were asked some questions about the storage of matrix at
the Porgera site during ICI's time there.
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. And you gave evidence that towards the end of ICI's occupation of the site
some 12 to 13 iso-tanks were kept?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Or were there. Firstly, do you recall until that end period, when there were
up to 13 such tanks, normally how many such tanks
were at the overall Porgera
site?
<P>

A. From memory, four or five.
<P>

Q. And I think in your statement you say that only two or three of those tanks
were stored near the processing plant?
<P>

A. That's correct.
<P>

Q. And they were the 20 tonne containers?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. And what happened with the rest of them, if there was more than two or three
at Porgera?
<P>

A. If there were more than a couple they would be stored around the perimeter
of the plant. I think possibly sometimes they would
still be down in the PJV
lay down, but there could be two or three around the perimeter of the plant, up
to.
<P>

Q. For how long were there 12 to 13 iso-tanks at the plant, that is, before ICI
vacated the site?
<P>

A. Well, it was a gradual build-up. It was a gradual build-up from memory for
about two to three months. We were using about 1,000
tonnes a year, about one
tank per week, so it would have taken some time for that to build-up."
<P>

(T 1572.41 - 1573.21)
<P>

183  	Although the evidence is not entirely satisfactory, I think the
effect of it was that, in terms of quantity of emulsion and
related materials
kept on site by Dyno, there was no material difference in the quantities of
matrix kept on site by ICI towards
the end of its contract. 
<P>

184  	Douglas described the aim of his report as follows:
<P>

"...to investigate in detail the process used by (Dyno) for the supply of both
packaged and bulk explosives to the minesite and
compare that with the ICI
process and make an assessment of the respective risks and consequences of a
detonation occurring of similar
magnitude to that which occurred at the process
site."
<P>

185  	He assessed the safety of the two operations by reference to
the proximity of the various elements of plant to each other
in terms of
industry recommendations and concluded as follows: 
<P>

"If one calculates the separation distance required by the quantities of
explosives approved to be present in the (Dyno) and ICI
manufacturing
operations ... neither company has provided sufficient separation to comply
with the Q/D (Quantity/Distance criteria
as recommended by the United Kingdom's
Explosives Storage and Transport Committee) criteria applied by Australian
statutory authorities."
<P>

186  	In relation to the EP Gold emulsion used by ICI, he observed
that it had been "authorised for use in the manufacture of POWERGEL
explosives". 
<P>

187  	Douglas took into account the risks associated with that part
of the ICI operation which involved the transport of matrix
by road and
detonators by air to Porgera. Of that aspect of the activity he observed as
follows:
<P>

"It is universally accepted that the risk of explosives detonating in the
process of manufacture is greater than in transport and
the risk of explosives
detonating in transport is greater than in storage ... that explosives
manufacture has five times the risk
of transport and transport has twice the
risk of storage."
<P>

188  	He summarised the two operations as follows:
<P>

" * (Dyno) manufactured packaged Emulite explosives.
<P>

* (Dyno) manufactured bulk AN emusion (sic) explosives using a mobile
manufacturing unit at the open pit mining site.
<P>

* (Dyno) assembled a maximum of 1000 Nonel detonators within an assembly plant
located some 15 metres from the process plant.
<P>

* ICI manufactured bulk AN emulsion explosives using a mobile manufacturing
unit at the process site."
<P>

189  	He assessed the "risk exposure of the ICI and (Dyno) operations
... as similar". In reaching that opinion, he assumed that
ICI maintained
storage of 100 tonnes of EP Gold adjacent to the process plant which "in a
conflagration" could have detonated the
matrix "with consequences equal to that
of the (Dyno) explosion". He further observed that "the likelihood of an
explosion occurring
within the ICI process plant area was significantly
increased due to the manufacture of ... Powergel". In relation to that
likelihood,
he expressed the further opinion that "the process site manufacture
of this explosive had a risk factor equal to the manufacture
of Emulite".
<P>

190  	Douglas concluded "that there was an equal possibility of a
similar incident (as the explosions) occurring, during ICI's contract
period,
with consequences equal to that of the (Dyno) explosion." He expressed his
reasoning as follows:
<P>

"... the risk from the ICI operations would have been significant since ANFO
type explosives were manufactured in the process plant
adjacent to the 100
tonnes storage of AN emulsion matrix and an explosion in the ANFO operations
could have resulted in a conflagration
and ultimate detonation of 100 tonnes of
AN emulsion matrix with consequences equal to that of the (Dyno) explosion."
<P>

191  	I have earlier referred to the report of the Gunnarson report
on the dangers inherent in the pumping of non-sensitised matrix.
With that in
mind, it is not difficult to understand Douglas' opinion of the comparability
of the ICI operation with that of the
Dyno operation in terms of risk. However,
I think the evidence is clear that the packaging of emulite under conditions of
heat and
pressure as occurred in the emulite packaging line carried a higher
propensity for inadvertent initiation of an explosion than existed
in the
pumping of matrix in the ICI operation. Further, there is some doubt as to the
actual number of twenty tonne containers containing
emulsion in use by ICI and
which were adjacent to the explosives site.
<P>

192  	While those matters bear upon the validity of Douglas' opinion,
I place considerable value upon it as an opinion given to
the assessors for
Niugini Insurance: one not prepared for the purpose of these proceedings, and
one made by an expert who had excellent
qualifications in the field. I think
his approach, in general terms, is preferable to the highly detailed hindsight
analysis presented
in these proceedings on behalf of Niugini Insurance. 
<P>

193  	In his statement of 11 May 1998, Douglas lent further support
to the conclusions reached in his report. He gave further opinion
evidence
concerning the proximity of the facilities in use by Dyno and ICI in terms of
the recommended separation distances under
the Australian Standards
publications. 
<P>

194  	In his oral evidence he elaborated upon that matter as
follows:
<P>

"Q. I rather gathered from your earlier answers that you considered that there
were aspects of the Porgera site that bore upon the
application of the
standards; is that so?
<P>

A. That is indeed so.
<P>

Q. What were they?
<P>

A. I think --
<P>

Q. What were those features?
<P>

A. Well, you have a high mountainous terrain in the Porgera area. The ability
of flat areas for a process site is extremely limited
and I can well imagine
the statutory authority would have to give special consideration in the
location of an explosives manufacturing
site and, in those considerations, I
could well imagine that he would agree to a lessening of the requirements or
recommendations,
I should say, of the Australian Standard."
<P>

(T751.19-751.38)
<P>

195  	Of the manufacture of ANFO type explosives, in which there
would be included the Amex series used by ICI, he stated:
<P>

"The ANFO type explosives were being manufactured in the process building.
That's the ammonium nitrate fuel type explosives, yes,
they were manufactured
and process mixed there in a coxan mixer, and part of my concern was that coxan
mixer, prior to the time ICI
was manufacturing those explosives, was the
subject of a hazard alert issued by the chief inspector of explosives in New
South Wales,
Phil Butt. He issued that hazard alert because of a previous
incidence (sic) involving explosions in coxan mixers, in the manufacture
of
ANFO type explosives."
<P>

(T753.35-753.46)
<P>

196  	Douglas described explosives such as ANFO and Amex as a
classified 1.1D explosive, "a cap-sensitive explosive". I have some
difficulty
with that as an unqualified statement. It is clear from the evidence of Hood
that in given drilling situations, Amex or
ANFO is capable of detonation
without a primer. However I think the evidence of Douglas and of Hood should be
regarded as a significant
practical approach to the comparative assessment of
the safety of the two operations respectively conducted by Dyno and ICI. 
<P>

197  	Further, I think Douglas' approach to the comparative
evaluation of risk of the ICI and Dyno operations finds support in the
Gunnarson report on the pumping of non-sensitised emulsion explosives as being
"extremely hazardous", a view that was shared by IT
Smith and by Hans Perlid of
Nitro Nobel in his report entitled "<b>Pump Safety Tests Regarding Emulsion
Explosives</b>"(the Perlid report). The relevant portion of that report was
summarised in submissions on behalf of Niugini Insurance as follows:
<P>

"Further, a similar view was expressed by Hans Perlid of Nitro Nobel who
indicated that in his opinion, in the handling of emulsion
explosives pumping
is the key operation. He continued by saying that a number of serious accidents
had shown that pumping can be
a risky operation and should be carefully
considered and investigated."
<P>

198  	Although the manufacture of emulsion on site, as performed by
Dyno, was not replicated in the ICI operation, the real point
of difference, in
my view, between the performance of the ICI and Dyno contracts lay in the
sensitising of emulsion and the preparation
of emulite by Dyno. While Douglas
balanced that activity with ICI's preparation of powergel at the plant, I think
the evidence established
that emulite and its method of processing under
conditions of pressure and heat raised significantly different safety factors
than
those involved in ICI's operations. However, that has to be kept in
context. Hood, in cross-examination, explained the situation
from the
engineer's viewpoint as follows:
<P>

"Q. Do you recall during the operation of the mine prior to August 1994 that
there were some difficulties experienced with the use
of the Emulite
product?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. And that one of the reactions to try and get over this was to increase its
sensitivity?
<P>

A. Yes. Was that referring to Emulite or heavy ANFO? I think that was the case.
Emulite was used primarily underground but there
were a number of issues
involved with the Emulite manufacture and its sensitivity.
<P>

Q. And the way in which the sensitivity was increased was by increasing the
addition of the Q-cells, was it not?
<P>

A. That would do that, up to a certain point, yes.
<P>

Q. And you know that in the months leading up to mid-1994 that process was
undertaken in an attempt to improve the performance of
Emulite, don't you?
<P>

A. I believe that to be the case.
<P>

Q. And one of the consequences of that sensitising process would be to render
the product more easy to detonate?
<P>

A. That's correct.
<P>

Q. And, therefore, in a safety sense, more dangerous?
<P>

A. No, I don't like the term "dangerous".
<P>

Q. Because it is a rather uncertain term?
<P>

A. Well, we don't - when you operate the mine you do not do things that are
dangerous, or you should not do things that are dangerous.
It has a greater
sensitivity to initiation, you are correct in that.
<P>

Q. So that the Emulite that was developed by increasing its sensitivity was
more sensitive to detonation than standard Emulite,
if I can put it that
way?
<P>

A. If it has - if it has had its sensitivity increased then yes, it is more
sensitive to detonation.
<P>

Q. And I think you have agreed with me that in the period prior to the
explosions steps were taken to make the Emulite more sensitive?
<P>

A. There were - I am aware of various things that were going on at the time
regarding sensitivity of the explosives, yes.
<P>

Q. And Emulite, itself, with or without these steps, is more sensitive than the
ANFO or ANFOPS mixtures that you refer to in paragraphs
69 and 70?
<P>

A. As a general rule, yes.
<P>

Q. Although I think you say steps can be taken to sensitise those products
also?
<P>

A. That's correct."
<P>

(T132.47-133.53)
<P>

199  	IT Smith, when cross-examined on the comparative safety of the
Porgera plant in relation to other Australian explosive plants
of Dyno, gave
the following evidence:
<P>

"Q. The Porgera site involved greater risk than any of the Australian sites;
would you agree with that?
<P>

A. I would agree it had the potential ... to have a greater risk or consequence
because of the Emulite manufacture. But that is
not to say that that in itself
posed a greater risk."
<P>

(T454.58-T455.14)
<P>

200  	The conclusion I have reached is that the nature of the risk
associated with explosives processing on site, whether by ICI
or Dyno, was such
that it was required to be disclosed at the inception of the policy.
<P>

201  	Dyno and Niugini Insurance have adduced a significant body of
expert opinion evidence in their respective cases, upon the
materiality of
disclosure of the risk associated with the operation of the explosives plant by
Dyno, which tended to concentrate
attention on perceived differences between
the operation of the explosives plant by Dyno and by ICI. Whereas, I think the
question
for closer consideration is the materiality of the risk inherent in
the ICI operations and the implications of any disclosure in
relation to the
ICI operations to underwriters prior to 1992.
<P>

202  	That question is linked with the facts, as I have found, that
the re-insurers proceeded upon a false premise in regarding
the operation of
the explosives plant by a contractor or supplier on site as a risk not covered
by the policy or by the endorsed
policy and as one performed by a contractor or
supplier on site who did not fall within the definition of the insured under
the policy
or the endorsed policy. That resulted in Niugini Insurance's failure
to evaluate the risk of the operation of the explosives plant
in a way which
the underwriting experts called on behalf of Niugini Insurance say would have
been undertaken had there been disclosure
of the risk associated with Dyno's
performance under the Dyno contract - they making the assumption that no such
disclosure had been
made. 
<P>

203  	Dyno relied on the evidence of Douglas and also of Brian
William Butler (Butler) as experts in relation to underwriting issues.
Butler
had a long association with the insurance industry, dating back to 1960. He had
an electrical engineering background and had
been for thirteen years with
Queensland Insurance Co Ltd as engineering surveyor and then as chief
engineering surveyor and deputy
chief engineer responsible for underwriting and
claims handling in relation to engineering contract works. For a further
twenty-two
years, he was with Australian Re-insurance Co Ltd and established
within it an engineering department to underwrite all classes of
engineering
business, although not limited to contract works. 
<P>

204  	The statements of evidence-in-chief of Butler were not
expressed in terms of the opinion of a prudent underwriter in evaluating
risk.
That was cured in his oral evidence-in-chief in which he equated the opinions
expressed in his written statements to those
of a prudent underwriter.
<P>

205  	The approach adopted by Butler made assumptions not dissimilar
to those made by Douglas, the most notable amongst which was
his assumption
that ICI stored between 400 and 500 tonnes of emulsion on site and his equating
of powergel with emulite. He also
took into account off-site risks in
transporting explosive materials which, I think, had a tenuous connection with
the risk, with
which the endorsed policy was concerned, although a significant
practical commercial consideration. I note in that regard that he
assumed that
ICI would be transporting emulite to Lae by ship and then by road to the
Porgera mine. That clearly was not the case.
It was emulsion that was so
transported.
<P>

206  	The approach to be adopted by an underwriter in assessing risk
was described by Butler as follows:
<P>

"This type of policy, particularly on a large project such as that which
existed at Porgera, leaves the insurer/underwriter with
relatively little
control over the contractors and subcontractors working on the site and falling
within the scope of the policy.
Accordingly, the insurer/reinsurer is largely
dependent upon the skill, efficiency and professionalism of the
principal/project manager
to ensure that the project is run in a proper and
workmanlike manner and without increasing the likelihood of losses being
incurred
under the policy. The track record and reputation of the
principal/project manager is therefore one of the main considerations of
the
underwriter/insurer at the time that consideration is being given to whether to
provide cover. Consistently with this, there
is generally no obligation in such
policies for the principal/project manager to notify the insurer/underwriter of
the particular
contractors or subcontractors who will be on the site at any
time. The policy issued in the present case was not specific as to which
contractors or subcontractors would be covered, nor was there any obligation to
notify of new subcontractors or any alterations to
existing subcontractors ...
(A)n underwriter would not generally have wanted or expected to be notified of
the identity of each of
the subcontractors or suppliers at the mine from time
to time."
<P>

207  	He then expressed the following opinions:
<P>

"(A prudent underwriter) would not have considered there to be any relevant
change in the risk at the mine if Dyno had taken over
from ICI as the supplier
of explosives. This opinion is based on the following factors:
<P>

(a) Explosives were a necessary part of an operating mine and ammonium nitrate
based explosives were used all over the world;
<P>

(b) The change in supplier was recommended by Placer. Placer was a manager of
mines throughout the world and (a prudent underwriter)
would have anticipated
that it had acted prudently in deciding to change suppliers;
<P>

(c) Dyno Wesfarmers was a large multinational corporation supplying and
manufacturing explosives all over the world and (a prudent
underwriter) would
have had no reason to believe that their proposed activities at the mine were
out of the ordinary;
<P>

(d) The activities at the mine were regulated by the local mine inspectors who
would not have approved any activity which was likely
to increase the risk
exposure;
<P>

(e) On the face of it the process of manufacturing on site as proposed by Dyno
appeared to have significant advantages over the
previous system in that
Emulite and detonators were not required to be trucked 750 kms from Lae to the
mine and the amount of Emulite
which was required to be stored at the mine at
any one time was significantly reduced;
<P>

(f) The value of the manufacturing plant which was in the order of $US 2
million was largely insignificant compared to the overall
value of the
project;
<P>

(g) The presence of Dyno's facility at the mine would have had no relevant
effect on the EML which had already been established
at the time of providing
the original cover.
<P>

...
<P>

Based on the assumptions above and for the reasons expressed in the answer to
Question 1, I would not have considered there to be
any material change in the
risk at the mine caused by the change in the supplier of explosives and
accordingly I would not have refused
to underwrite the project from November
1992 onwards nor would I have sought to exclude DWL from the benefit of the
policy."
<P>

208  	Where he refers to EML, that is an acronym for estimated
maximum loss. I do not regard his equating of powergel, that being
sensitised
emulsion, with emulite as undermining the force of those conclusions. 
<P>

209  	It was clear from his cross-examination that his opinion on the
immateriality of the difference in the operations of Dyno
and ICI was based
upon the view that appropriate "control features" would have been introduced
and for that assumption one would
depend upon the commercial standing of the
principal contractor, in this case the PJV. I think the cross-examination also
exposed
the fact that he had no regard to any departure from the Australian
Standards which recommended separation distances of elements
within the
explosives plant. 
<P>

210  	In re-examination he considered that questions of safety
relating to separation distances between elements in the explosives
plant would
be covered by approval of responsible government authorities with jurisdiction
over the works. The explosives plant,
layout and operation had been, in fact,
the subject of approval by the Mines Department. 
<P>

211  	The essential approach adopted by Hettler to the nature of the
risk which Munich Re was being asked to consider was expressed,
I think, in his
evidence in the following way:
<P>

"169. I would have no difficulty with covering the construction of an
explosives facility, but the operation of an explosives facility
would be a
major concern. As subsequent events showed, the operational risk included risk
of loss (which might be catastrophic) through
explosion. This is not the type
of risk that would normally be covered under a contract works policy, nor
underwritten by an engineering
underwriter.
<P>

170. Accordingly, had it been put to me that the risk included the operation of
an explosives manufacturing facility, I would have
consulted with MR's Property
and Fire Department with respect to the risk it posed to other insured property
or to the insured's
liability exposure. This is what I did with the new DWL
facility. That Department has underwriters who are experienced in assessing
the
risk of loss from fire and explosion. I would not and could not have accepted
as a lead underwriter for the London Engineering
Market the operational risk of
an explosives manufacturing facility under a contract works policy. I would
have told the broker that
he would have to seek such cover from the Fire and
Property Market on a separate basis.
<P>

171. From my knowledge and experience, within MR, fire and explosion risks
arising out of operational activities - particularly
those relating to mines
which might involve the potential loss, damage or closure of the whole mine -
are normally underwritten,
if at all, by the Property and Fire Department.
Whereas the Engineering Department might write a big line (perhaps 20% or more)
of
an engineering risk, the Property and Fire Department would not normally
write such a big line on a risk involving the possibility
of a catastrophic
loss."
<P>

212  	Those paragraphs had been objected to. However, I admitted them
as admissible and relevant to the non-disclosure issues. I
think the evidence
also went to the issue of good faith raised against Niugini Insurance by Dyno.
What is clear from that evidence
is that Munich Re, acting for Niugini
Insurance, had understood that the operation of the explosives plant formed no
part of any
cover under the policy or the endorsed policy, whereas the view I
have reached is that it did. ICI had been on site for several years
prior to
1992 operating the explosives plant as contractor to the PJV and as supplier on
site of explosives. 
<P>

213  	It has not been submitted that the nature of the explosives
processing on site conducted by either ICI or Dyno was in any
way
unconventional - having regard to the remote and geographically hostile
environment in which the Porgera mine was located. That
is given emphasis by
the evidence of PC Smith that, had ICI successfully negotiated a fresh contract
with PJV in November 1992, it,
too, would have manufactured matrix on site
rather than transport to site and store huge quantities of emulsion to match
the planned
increase in mine production. 
<P>

214  	It is not in dispute that the operation of the explosives plant
was performed by a contractor or a supplier on site as part
of the construction
of the various stages of works which formed part of the insured property. It is
certainly true of stages 1, 2
and 3 and, I think, it is probably true of stage
4. 
<P>

215  	In his approach to the operation of the policy, I think Hettler
placed some reliance upon his dealings with Robertson. While
I admitted a
significant amount of evidence of Hettler's dealings with the broker, in my
view, that evidence of his understanding
of the construction of the policy and
of the endorsed policy was relevant to the good faith issue raised against
Niugini Insurance
in relation to its refusal to recognise Dyno as an insured,
its rejection of Dyno's claim and its avoidance of the policy on grounds
of a
non-disclosure which had been the subject of waiver by Niugini Insurance as
against the PJV. 
<P>

216  	I think it is unnecessary to give detailed consideration to the
evidence of the dealings between Munich Re and Robertson beyond
considering the
non-disclosure and good faith issues as no question of rectification of the
policy or of the endorsed policy arises.
<P>

217  	Hettler presented as a careful recorder of events, as he saw
their significance, which comprised the circumstances in which
Niugini
Insurance went on risk, extended cover from time to time and, after the
explosions, the manner in which the claims were dealt
with leading up to the
settlement deed. He was clearly convinced of the correctness of his
understanding of the operation of the
policy and of his entitlement to pay heed
to matters conveyed to him in that regard by Robertson and others. 
<P>

218  	On the underwriters' side, he was not alone in that approach to
the policy. I think it was evident from his evidence in the
witness box that he
found the PJV's endeavours to enforce benefits under the endorsed policy in
favour of Dyno as both distasteful
and, I think, unjust: factors which I think
imposed considerable strains upon him in a situation which was not assisted by
the need
to evidence the position of the insurer in a foreign court in
proceedings conducted in a foreign language. It is not disputed that
in the
course of some of the meetings leading up to the settlement deed, statements
were made by representatives of the PJV which
reinforced Hettler's belief that
Dyno was not an insured under the endorsed policy. Statements of that kind were
attributed to Jonathan
Russell of Placer Dome in the company of Robertson and
others at a meeting of 19 August 1994. 
<P>

219  	As earlier noted in these reasons, no representation or
estoppel case is persisted in by Niugini Insurance. However, that
material
remains relevant to the good faith issue. 
<P>

220  	The importance of Munich Re's approach to the construction of
the policy and the endorsed policy, I think, is fundamental
to the
understanding of the disclosure of risk issue. By way of illustration, I think
it is clear from the evidence I have quoted
above from the statement of Hettler
that, had the insurer appreciated the full extent of the cover as I have found
it to be, other
steps would have been taken, than those followed by Munich Re,
and, in particular, the risk of the operation of the explosives plant
would
have been referred to Munich Re's Property and Fire department. 
<P>

221  	I should add that the experience of Hettler as a head
underwriter acting on behalf of Munich Re is extensive and one should
have due
regard to his expert evidence on underwriting, save only for the following
matters. I have referred to the strong impression
created by Hettler of his
complete identification with the interests of Munich Re. Also, I think there
were one or two examples where
language difficulties and that identification of
interests resulted in a particular approach to the facts that may not have
found
favour with me. His general reliability, I think, may be measured against
the extensive contemporaneous notes which he kept and which
were available for
these proceedings. I cannot recall any cross-examination of him which caused me
to doubt the reliability of his
contemporaneous notes. I regarded him as an
honest witness whose reliability was only qualified by his close identification
with
the interests of the underwriters and unfamiliarity with foreign legal
processes.
<P>

222  	The reality is that, in the feasibility study, the involvement
of an explosives plant in the construction of the insured works
was disclosed
to Munich Re. Further, the evidence disclosed that in site inspections, in
which Hettler took part, the ICI plant was
identified as an "explosives plant",
and on one such occasion, it was drawn to his attention that the plant was
exposed to the possible
threat of slippage in the site vicinity. 
<P>

223  	Moreover, the status reports provided to Munich Re identified,
during the performance of stages 1, 2 and 3, the presence of
ICI as an
explosives supplying contractor. Hettler gave evidence that the full extent of
the explosives plant as outlined in the
feasibility study was not persevered
with. There has been no direct evidence of that which I recall. However, I
think the costings
submitted to Munich Re by the PJV subsequently to the
feasibility study, including the costings in the projected implementation plan
of June 1990, support that evidence of Hettler. He also gave evidence of his
understanding of the presence of storage facilities
on site. However, I think
it is inescapable that in a project of this magnitude and having regard to its
isolation, it would be inevitable
that extensive processing of explosives in an
explosives plant of some kind or another would be essential and obvious for the
execution
of the project. 
<P>

224  	Consequently, I think Hettler's comparative disregard for the
nature of the ICI operations was due, not to any particular
understanding of a
changed operation from that contemplated in the feasibility study, rather it
was due, probably entirely, to his
mis-understanding of the nature of the cover
being provided by Niugini Insurance. For example, there was no suggestion that
following
the receipt of the feasibility study and the extensive provision
within that document for the operation of an explosives plant that
any
reference of that facility was made by Munich Re to its property and fire
department for risk assessment. I think the reason
for that lay entirely with
Munich Re's understanding that the cover under consideration and upon which it
went on risk did not extend
to the disclosed explosives operation and,
consequently, its understanding that the explosives contractor was not covered
by the
policy or the endorsed policy.
<P>

225  	The position of Hettler was shared by other underwriters
associated with the inception of the risk by Niugini Insurance. It
is almost
axiomatic, from the evidence of Hettler and the other underwriters, that had it
been appreciated that ICI was a contractor
or supplier on site and as such an
insured under the policy in its operation of the explosives plant, the material
provided by the
PJV with the feasibility study, and subsequently through status
reports and site inspections, would clearly have prompted the sort
of enquiry
that Hettler evidenced would have taken place on disclosure of the Dyno
operation. 
<P>

226  	Utz Groetschel (Groetschel) was a member of the executive
management of Munich Re, who, at the time of the inception of the
policy, was
an underwriter in Munich Re's engineering department. As such he was involved
in the "original phases of underwriting
in 1988". In that capacity he received,
amongst other information, the feasibility study. It was clear from his
evidence that he
disregarded references in the feasibility study, and
presumably any other information provided on behalf of the PJV relating to the
operation of an explosives plant, regarding them as irrelevant. The subject
policy, as he understood it, excluded operational cover
for a mining operation.
Clearly, he did not advert to the fact that the explosives plant would be
operated for the construction of
stages of the insured works and that the
operator of such a plant, under contract to the PJV, would be a contractor
falling within
the description of the insured under the proposed policy: nor,
did he place any reliance upon the extension of the endorsed policy
to an
operational all risks cover.
<P>

227  	He gave evidence of his site inspection in 1993 at which the
inspection of an explosives facility in operation did not form
part. He
described the view he would have taken had he been aware that the operation of
the explosives plant could have been regarded
as falling within the proposed
cover as follows:
<P>

"From my point of view, since (Munich Re) did not intend to cover mining
operations, but only construction phases, a facility for
the described purpose
of manufacturing slurries for the ongoing mining operations would not fall
within what I understood to be covered.
If operational facilities were to be
covered, a different type of policy would be required. I would not have seen
the operation of
such a facility as part of the construction project. There
was, pursuant to the Phased Handover clause, cover for facilities completed
(and therefore operational) until the last phase of construction was completed.
However, the explosives facility was not included
in this cover because the
cover was exclusively for the ore processing plant and facilities described in
the project information,
which excluded the mining operation.
<P>

If my attention had been drawn to this proposal for an explosive slurry
facility, I would have ascertained in detail to what extent
such facility or
its operation could be included under the policy and, whether included or not,
what potential risk would result
from its existence to other property on site.
However, there is no reference on file to suggest that this issue was ever
drawn to
(Munich Re's) attention."
<P>

228  	There are a number of matters there which purport to evidence
the intention of the insurer and the insurer's construction
of the policy
which, as such, is inadmissible. However, that material was admitted as
relevant to the understanding of the insurer
and relevant to the good faith and
material disclosure issues.
<P>

229  	Clearly, in my view of the policy and, particularly, of the
endorsed policy, Groetschel's view of the insurer's exposure to
indemnify the
PJV and, in particular, the contractor or supplier involved in the provision of
explosives was erroneous. It is clear
that had he been of the understanding of
the operation of the policy as I have found it to operate, then he would have
undertaken
a valuation of the risk associated with that operation. 
<P>

230  	I am satisfied that the information provided by the PJV was
ample to put on notice the possible risk associated with the operation
of an
explosives plant on site and that by reason of the erroneous construction
placed upon the policy and the endorsed policy, Niugini
Insurance failed to
follow up that information in the manner which it is now said it would have
done. 
<P>

231  	I find the stand taken by the underwriter in relation to the
endorsed policy extremely difficult to accept. Essentially what
is said is that
the operation of the explosives plant was exclusively for the benefit of the
mining operations and as such the operation
fell outside the terms of the
operational all risks cover. 
<P>

232  	However, it is clear that the operation of the explosives plant
involved works falling within stage 4, for example, in relation
to the
construction of the connecting drive. Whether damage to that work was excluded
under exception o) to Section I of the cover,
(I am inclined to the view that
such damage was not excluded), it still remains that Dyno was engaged as
contractor and supplier
on site of explosives for the performance of those
works which, even on Niugini Insurance's construction of the policy, would
place
it as a contractor and/or supplier within the meaning of "the Insured"
under the endorsed policy. That remains the case whether exception
o) applies
to damage to that connecting drive or not.
<P>

233  	Groetschel's explanation for not following up the explosives
plant information as set out in the feasibility study was that
the cost of that
plant had not appeared in the actual summary of sum insured. I challenge that
having regard to the material referred
to earlier in these reasons which, in my
view, clearly disclosed the explosives plant as forming part of the Stage I
construction
of the works which, on any view of it, was part of the proposed
property to be insured.
<P>

234  	The extent of Groetschel's misunderstanding of the operation of
the policy I think was exposed in cross-examination where
he expressed the view
that the explosives plant building itself was not covered. Clearly those works
were part of the staged construction
works as to which there was no issue as to
them being part of the insured property. In fact, the destruction of that plant
building
was the subject of indemnity under Section I of the policy in the
payment effected pursuant to the settlement deed. 
<P>

235  	I think it was highly significant that, for the purpose of the
preparation of his evidence-in-chief, as to his understanding
of the lack of
operational cover under the policy, Groetschel had not been shown the 1992 and
1994 endorsements (T1792.15) and that
for the purpose of his statement he had
not checked the detail of the endorsements (T1792.42).
<P>

236  	Hans Gfeller (Gfeller) is the head of the engineering section
of Swiss Re in Zurich and a member of its senior management
responsible for
underwriting in Asia and Australia. He is the lead reinsurance underwriter for
the Sydney Olympic site. He had been
approached by Robertson to go on risk in
relation to the Porgera project. He lost out on that underwriting to Munich Re.
He gave
evidence which, in substance, contested the views expressed by Butler.
However, in cross-examination I think he exposed the consequence
of the
underwriter's misconstruction of the cover provided by the policy and
especially the endorsed policy. 
<P>

237  	It was Gfeller's opinion in his evidence-in-chief that the
provision of "an explosives facility on site clearly and significantly
altered
the underwriters' exposure". He was "not aware that any explosive factory would
have to be covered on the site or next to
the site" (T1852.55). In relation to
the ICI operations, he said that at the time of giving his statement he
"learned that explosive
manufacturing took place (which at) the time of the
underwriting ... was not disclosed" (T1853.23). He had referred to the
feasibility
studies prior to going on risk (T1853.52). The following evidence,
I think, has some bearing on this issue:
<P>

"Q. So you do not know, one way or the other, Mr Gfeller, do you, whether or
not it was disclosed to Munich Re that there would
be a plant for the
manufacture of bulk explosives built as part of this project?
<P>

A. I do not know, but I would assume, as an underwriter, if it was such a major
change then that should be made known to all underwriters,
not only to the
lead. That's my opinion.
<P>

Q. When you say "a major change", Mr Gfeller, a major change from what?
<P>

A. From the status on which basis the risk has been underwritten.
<P>

Q. If the status upon which the risk had been underwritten included an
intention to construct an explosives manufacturing plant
then obviously there
would be no change that had to be notified to underwriters, would there?
<P>

A. If it was disclosed, you are correct."
<P>

(T1854.15-T1854.35)
<P>

238  	It is common ground that such an intention was conveyed in the
feasibility study provided to the insurer. That was followed
by further
cross-examination which I think exposed the real basis of the failure of the
eventual underwriters to act on the information
provided by the PJV in relation
to the explosives plant. The evidence I refer to is as follows:
<P>

"Q. Have you given any consideration to the respective risks which applied
during ICI's period as explosives supplier to the Porgera
Mine prior to
November 1992 and the position after that when Dyno Wesfarmers became
explosives supplier?
<P>

A. Very difficult question, because I was involved in the underwriting at the
beginning while I was stationed in Swiss Re in England.
Later on, I assumed
different responsibilities and it was handled by a colleague of mine. That was
as from mid-91.
<P>

Q. Mr Gfeller, am I right in thinking that --
<P>

HIS HONOUR: I don't think you've got an answer to that question, Mr Gyles.
<P>

MR GYLES: Q. Mr Gfeller, would you answer the --
<P>

HIS HONOUR: Q. I will have that last question read out to you, Mr Gfeller: the
question was have you given any consideration to
the respective risks which
applied during ICI's period as explosives supplier to the Porgera Mine prior to
November 1992 and the
position after that when Dyno Wesfarmers became
explosives supplier. Could you answer that question?
<P>

A. Not really, your Honour. Since the basis was that this disclosure in respect
of explosive manufacturing was never done. So I
was of the opinion whatever is
used as explosives will be transported in but not manufactured on site, so I
had a different basis.
What happened then later on, switching to another
supplier or producer, I was - then I was no more involved in this risk."
<P>

(T1854.37-1855.14)
<P>

239  	In further<b> </b>cross-examination by senior counsel on behalf
of the PJV, Gfeller gave the following evidence:
<P>

"Q. Let me ask you this question: had you been told before considering whether
you would underwrite the risk which you were asked
to consider underwriting
that an explosives plant would be built at Porgera for the manufacture of
slurries, explosives, that is
in the form of slurries, would that piece of
information have enabled you to institute necessary inquiries about the
possibility
of explosives risks?
<P>

A. I would say yes.
<P>

Q. That piece of information to you, as an experienced underwriter, would have
caused warning signals to flash in your mind, wouldn't
it?
<P>

A. I would say so.
<P>

Q. You underwrote part of the risk on behalf of Swiss Re at the premium set by
Mr Hettler, didn't you?
<P>

A. Yes. Well, we - yes, we wrote the share. We accepted the share, the
following share.
<P>

...
<P>

Q. If you, as an experienced underwriter, had visited the site of the project
before deciding to underwrite the risk, and you had
been told during your site
inspection by somebody guiding you around "That building over there is an
explosives plant", and it was
part of the mine project - do you follow me?
<P>

A. Yes, I do.
<P>

Q. That would have caused you - would that have caused you to make some
inquiries?
<P>

A. Oh, sure. Sure, yes.
<P>

Q. The same sort of inquiries, if you were a competent underwriter, that you
would have made if one of the files provided to you
for the purpose of
considering whether you would underwrite contained a statement that an
explosives plant would be built at Porgera
for the manufacture of slurries; you
would agree?
<P>

A. Yes."
<P>

(T1865.25-1866.29)
<P>

240  	It is reasonably clear from that evidence that the underwriters
wrongly assumed that the policy, as worded, did not extend
to a contractor or
supplier on site who supplied explosives or processed explosives at the
explosives plant for the purpose of the
construction of the stages described in
the policy as part of the property insured. Whereas, in my view, ICI in that
role clearly
was covered. But for that misconception it is equally clear that
the underwriters would have carried out the task of examining the
risk of
explosive production at the plant for the purpose of going on risk under the
policy and particularly under the endorsed policy
which extended cover to an
operational all risks cover. 
<P>

241  	For those reasons I am satisfied that there has been no failure
on the part of the PJV to disclose the risk associated with
the operation of
the explosives plant by ICI and then, in turn, by Dyno: the mere change in the
identity of the supplier, itself
being, in my view, a matter of indifference,
given the dependence by the insurer upon the expertise of the PJV in the
selection of
its contractors for the project. 
<P>

242  	In my view, the evidence of James Patrick Gleeson, who was
called in the Niugini Insurance case, did not advance that case
in relation to
the non-disclosure issue. He was the departmental manager of the claims
department of Munich Re at its United Kingdom
branch back in London. His
involvement arose after notification of the claim by the PJV. He was
cross-examined about the significance
of information provided to the insurer
prior to going on risk as follows:
<P>

"Q. Did Mr Hettler ever tell you that when he first visited the site in 1989
that an employee of the Porgera Joint Venture pointed
out a building and said
that that is the explosives plant?
<P>

A. I do recall him saying that to me. The words he used to me were not
"explosive plant" but it was pointed out to him as the "explosives
storage
area". That's my best recollection.
<P>

Q. Mr Hettler has told us in sworn evidence that he was told that it was the
explosives plant?
<P>

A. Right. As I said, my best recollection is he said, "explosives storage".
It's not something which I recall seeing any notes on.
It was a verbal thing
which Mr Hettler advised me. Whether he used the words "plant" or "storage" to
myself, when relaying that situation,
I couldn't specifically recall.
<P>

Q. Well, if you had been told by him that in fact he had been told it was an
explosives plant, as a native born English speaker
you would immediately
recognise that as having some connotation of manufacture?
<P>

A. Not necessarily.
<P>

Q. Really. Perhaps then --
<P>

A. It's possible.
<P>

Q. Have you ever heard anyone in English describe a storage place as a
"plant"?
<P>

A. No, no, I can't recall that."
<P>

(T1959.10-T1959.41)
<P>

243  	Along similar lines was the further cross-examination as
follows:
<P>

"Q. ... if Ekke Hettler had told you that while he was considering whether to
underwrite the risk he had read a document provided
to him by the potential
insured PJV in which specific reference was made to the erection of a plant for
the manufacture of slurries,
would that have been an important piece of
information to you in considering what to do about Dyno? Would that not have
been an important
piece of information to you if Ekke Hettler had vouchsafed it
to you?
<P>

A. It would have been important and also it would have been --
<P>

Q. It would have been material information, wouldn't it?
<P>

A. I think the word "erection" would also be fairly critical in that
description of the plant.
<P>

Q. The erection of a plant for the manufacture of slurries, would that have
been a material piece of information if it had been
given to you at the time
when you were considering whether or not to indemnify Dyno?
<P>

A. My answer again is --
<P>

Q. Well, the answer can be "yes" or "no" sir. Is it "yes" or is it "no"?
<P>

A. The answer is yes."
<P>

(T1968.14 - 42)
<P>

244  	A further related issue has been raised by the PJV and Dyno,
namely that any non-disclosure of risk relating to the operation
of the
explosives plant had been waived by Niugini Insurance's election to pay the
PJV's claim under Section I of the policy, included
in that being a claim in
respect of the explosives plant and the leased equipment. The conclusion I have
reached is that that waiver
of non-disclosure, had there been any
non-disclosure, operated for the benefit of Dyno, in the sense that Niugini
Insurance was precluded
from avoiding the policy as it purported to do on the
ground of non-disclosure. 
<P>

245  	In reaching that conclusion, I accept the expert evidence of
Aikens QC that in English law the policy would be recognised
as a composite
policy. However, I think there are compelling reasons why Niugini Insurance is
precluded from relying upon non-disclosure
in purporting to avoid the policy as
against Dyno only. In the first place, Niugini Insurance has pocketed and
retained the very
substantial premium paid under the policy and the endorsed
policy. As at August 1994, those premiums, as payable by the PJV, were
in
excess of US$25,000,000. Some portion of that premium must be allocated to the
risk represented by the operation of the explosives
plant. 
<P>

Niugini Insurance has purported to avoid the policy without disgorging any part
of the substantial premium which must be deemed
to have been taken under the
policy by the insurer, in relation to the cover relating to the explosives
facility. 
<P>

246  	Further, the evidence is compelling that the major
consideration in the insurer's acceptance of the PJV claim, notwithstanding
the
insurer's stance on non-disclosure, lay in the consequence of rejecting the
claim of a) refunding premiums or relinquishing entitlement
to premiums in the
vicinity of $30,000,000 and b) alienating an extremely powerful commercial
group of companies from whose continuing
and future business enterprises could
be expected to emerge substantial insurance business. 
<P>

247  	In those circumstances, I am reasonably confident that it is
not open to the insurer to do so. In a sense, Niugini Insurance
is hoist on its
own petard in relying upon the 'party point' to resist the enforcement of the
policy by Dyno. 
<P>

248  	I accept that the effect of non-disclosure by one co-assured is
that stated by the English Court of Appeal in <b>New Hampshire Insurance Co v
MGN Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20LRLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] LRLR 24</a> at 57-58, where the following passage appears in the
judgment of Staughton LJ:
<P>

"<i>Issue G:</i>
<P>

Whether, in the light of the answer to issue (F) above and on a true
construction of the contracts of insurance and Chubb policies,
any
non-disclosure or misrepresentation, breach of the duty of the utmost good
faith or breach of any other obligation by any one
assured in itself: - (i)
constitutes a non-disclosure, misrepresentation, breach of the duty of the
utmost good faith or breach of
such obligation by all or any other Assured:
and/or (ii) in the event and to the extent that it entitles insurers to avoid
the contracts
of insurance and/or Chubb to avoid the Chubb Policies as against
that Assured, also entitles Insurers to avoid the Contracts of Insurance
and/or
Chubb to avoid the Chubb Policies as against all or any other Assureds.
<P>

In the light of our conclusion on issue F, the answer to this question is in
our judgment, No. Technically one ought to enquire
whether for each layer in
each year there was one contract, or as many contracts as there were companies
insured. And if the former,
can a contract be avoided for non-disclosure as
against one or some of the insured, but not against others? We feel that we are
relieved
from the need to answer those questions by the authority of the House
of Lords, in the passage already quoted from <i>P. Samuel &amp; Co. Ltd. v.
Dumas.</i> That, it is true, was not a case of non-disclosure but of wilful
misconduct by one of two persons insured. But in our opinion the
principle that
the innocent party can still recover if it is a separate insurance must equally
apply.
<P>

Mr. Justice Potter had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt
that there were likely to be situations "whereby
an officer of Company A, as
well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the
affairs of Company C
and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such
a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or
obligations of good faith in respect of all three". We were not addressed on
that point, and the Judge's observations on it should
stand.
<P>

<i>Issue H:</i>
<P>

Whether, in the light of the answer to issue (F) above and on a true
construction of the Contracts of Insurance and the Chubb Policies,
a loss: -
(i) resulting from a transfer of assets from one Assured to another Assured; is
capable of constituting a loss falling
within the terms of the Contracts of
Insurance and/or the Chubb Policies. [Part (ii) of the question was
withdrawn].
<P>

If by a peril insured against one of the companies insured is deprived of
money, securities or other property, which is received
by another of the
companies insured, that is in our judgment a loss covered by the policy. The
answer flows from the view that we
have reached on issue F."
<P>

249  	However, that decision does not address the purported avoidance
of the policy as against one co-assured by an insurer who
elects to retain the
premium which it accepted in providing indemnity for the works the subject of
the avoided policy. There is a
more fundamental distinction from the
circumstances examined in <b>New Hampshire </b>in the facts of this case.
Inferentially, <b>New Hampshire </b>was concerned with separate, disparate
obligations of disclosure and, on that basis, the court was able to isolate the
entitlement
of an insurer to avoid a composite policy as against one co-assured
for that co-assured's non-disclosure, the rationale being that
that
non-disclosure did not touch the integrity of the policy in place with the
other co-assured. 
<P>

250  	In this case there is one source of disclosure, that is the
duty of disclosure placed upon the PJV as agent for Dyno in effecting
and
maintaining the cover. In that respect PJV's duty of disclosure was
co-extensive with that of Dyno.
<P>

251  	It is my view that there is no room for exploiting the
composite nature of the policy in the circumstances of this case to
maintain
the policy in place with the PJV for selfish commercial reasons by waiving
entitlement to rely upon non-disclosure of the
explosives risk, and at the same
time, purporting to avoid the policy against the co-assured, Dyno, for
non-disclosure of the very
same risk. 
<P>

252  	For the purpose of considering the issue of non-disclosure, I
have adopted the reasoning of the majority in <b>Pan Atlantic Insurance</b>
<b>Co Ltd v Pine Top Insurance Co Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20AC%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 AC 501</a><b> </b>as to which I
think it is sufficient to state the tests of materiality in the form addressed
in the headnote of that report as follows:
<P>

"<i>Held</i>, dismissing the appeal, (1) (Lord Templeman and Lord Lloyd of
Berwick dissenting) that under section 18 of the Marine Insurance Act
1906,
which was applicable by analogy in a non-marine case, a "material circumstance"
was one that would have an effect on the mind
of the prudent insurer in
estimating the risk and it was not necessary that it should have a decisive
effect on his acceptance of
the risk or on the amount of premium demanded ...

<P>

(2) That before an underwriter could avoid a contract for non-disclosure of a
material circumstance he had to show that he had actually
been induced by the
non-disclosure to enter into the policy on the relevant terms ...

part."
<P>

253  	The circumstances of waiver are not in issue, nor are the
principles of waiver in issue. Shortly stated, the principles are
that an
election is made, if the party against whom the election is asserted uses words
or engages in conduct which is consistent
only with the exercise of one of two
sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other: it has to be
communicated to
the other party in clear and unequivocal terms: it must be
irrevocable and it must be made with full knowledge, the facts which would
give
rise to the right to take the course open to that party. 
<P>

254  	I do not understand there to be an issue as to the full
knowledge of the facts on the part of Niugini Insurance in electing
to affirm
the policy and satisfying the PJV's claim under it by means of the settlement
deed. Nor is there any issue that such an
election was inconsistent with the
rights to avoid the policy for non-disclosure. The only question is whether
that inconsistency
may be restricted to rights of avoidance for non-disclosure
as against the PJV. But even that question requires to be further distilled
to
the question, whether that inconsistency may be restricted to its right of
avoidance as against the PJV for non-disclosure by
PJV, acting in its own right
and not as agent. I am satisfied, in the circumstances of this case that the
election may not be so
restricted. The duty of disclosure in this case of the
PJV was that of principal and agent and, so far as was relevant, that duty
was
co-extensive and, I think, indivisible.
<P>

255  	Niugini Insurance raised a further insurance issue under the
due care clause of the endorsed policy which provided as follows:
<P>

"The Insured shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss, damage or
liability."
<P>

256  	I think it is common ground between the parties that the test
to be applied in the construction of such a clause is that laid
down by the
English Court of Appeal in <b>Fraser v BN Furman (Productions) Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20WLR%20898" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1
WLR 898</a> at 905-6 where Diplock LJ commented on the proper construction of that
clause in the following terms:
<P>

" "Reasonable" does not mean reasonable as between the employer and the
employee. It means reasonable as between the insured and
the insurer having
regard to the commercial purpose of the contract, which is inter alia to
indemnify the insured against liability
for his (the insured's) personal
negligence. That, too, is established by the case which I have cited.
Obviously, the condition cannot
mean that the insured must take measures to
avert dangers which he does not himself foresee, although the hypothetical
reasonably
careful employer would foresee them. That would be repugnant to the
commercial purpose of the contract, for failure to foresee dangers
is one of
the commonest grounds of liability in negligence. What, in my view, is
"reasonable" as between the insured and the insurer,
without being repugnant to
the commercial object of the contract, is that <u>the insured should not
deliberately court a danger, the existence of which he recognises</u>, by
refraining from taking any measures to avert it. Equally, the condition cannot
mean that, where the insured recognises that there
is a danger, the measures
which he takes to avert it must be such as the hypothetical reasonable
employer, exercising due care and
observing all the relevant provisions of the
Factories Act, 1961, would take. That, too, would be repugnant to the
commercial purpose
of the contract, for failure to take such measures is
another ground of liability in negligence for breach of statutory duty. What,
in my judgment, is reasonable as between the insured and the insurer, without
being repugnant to the commercial purpose of the contract,
is that <u>the
insured, where he does recognise a danger should not deliberately court it by
taking measures which he himself knows are inadequate
to avert it</u>. In other
words, it is not enough that <u>the employer's omission to take any particular
precautions to avoid accidents should be negligent; it must be at least
reckless, that
is to say, made with actual recognition by the insured himself
that a danger exists, and not caring whether or not it is averted</u>. <u>The
purpose of the condition is to ensure that the insured will not, because he is
covered against loss by the policy refrain from
taking precautions which he
knows ought to be taken</u>."
<P>

(Emphasis added.)
<P>

257  	In association with that due care case, it has been submitted
on behalf of Niugini Insurance that the due care clause is a
condition
precedent to the indemnity and that the onus of satisfying compliance with that
condition rests solely with Dyno: always
assuming that it is an assured under
the policy and one which Niugini Insurance is not entitled to avoid for
non-disclosure. There
is nothing in <b>Furman</b> to support the submission on
behalf of Niugini Insurance that the onus for satisfying compliance with the
due care clause rests with
Dyno. Quite the contrary, Diplock LJ expressed the
onus as being that of the insurer and his judgment was the leading judgment in
<b>Furman</b> with which the rest of the Court agreed.
<P>

258  	I have been referred to no other English authorities to support
the propositions advanced on behalf of Niugini Insurance.
I have been referred
to several Australian decisions which are to the contrary of the view expressed
in <b>Furman</b>. However, I fail to see what relevance those authorities have
in the context of these proceedings. In any event, the issue is not
one
resolved by recourse to onus. In my view, the evidence disclosed a responsible
approach by Dyno to safety issues. Consistently
with that conclusion I am
satisfied that standards of care by operators at the site fell below a
reasonable standard of care in relation
to the processing of emulite in the
mono-pump packaging line. 
<P>

259  	I have no doubt that the isolation of the mine represented a
significant challenge to the implementation, supervision and
maintenance of
appropriate safety standards in the operation of the explosives plant by Dyno.
In particular, in a number of respects
the way in which malfunctions of the
mono-pump in the emulite packaging line was addressed in the several months
prior to the explosion
left something to be desired in the application of
appropriate measures.
<P>

260  	It was also submitted on behalf of Niugini Insurance that once
breach of the due care clause had been established, it is unnecessary
to show
that the breach had a causative effect on the occurrence giving rise to the
claim of indemnity. I have not been referred
to any English authorities on this
question and it has not been explained to me why one would have regard to
Australian cases on
the question other than as a 'Commonwealth' decision.
Nothing turns on that question given the firm conclusion I have reached that
there has been no breach of the due care clause. 
<P>

261  	As a general observation about the due care issue, there is
something, I think, quite unrealistic about an attack on the general
standard
of operations of Dyno when it is appreciated that, every step along the way,
its establishment, method of operation and
performance of its tasks were
subject to the approval and supervision of the Mines Department whose approval
was in fact obtained.
In the course of performance of the operation no
suggestion was made nor any requirement imposed by the Mines Department that
would
lend support for the very serious imputations implicit in Niugini
Insurance's case. 
<P>

262  	In saying that, I am not unmindful of the evidence relating to
the operation of the nonel plant concurrently with emulsion
processing. Niugini
Insurance seemed to lose sight of the serious implications in its case when
regard is had to the obvious consequences
of recklessness in an operation of
this kind. 
<P>

263  	Far from any evidence of such a lackadaisical approach to the
project, I think IT Smith and others demonstrated a considerable
concern for
matters of safety and the protection of staff and property and acted upon these
reasons. In my view, there is something
abhorrent in the proposition that such
men acted with reckless indifference to safety matters in full knowledge of the
consequences
of that indifference. IT Smith, in particular, impressed me
considerably as a person with a keen sense of responsibility and diligence
in
the performance of his duties with Dyno: and he, it will be remembered, was the
person primarily responsible for the putting in
place of appropriate safety
measures within Dyno.
<P>

264  	The breach of the due care clause was categorised by Niugini
Insurance as falling into the following:
<P>

"(1) Failure adequately to address problems with the Emulite pack-out
monopump
<P>

(2) Failure to provide a system of preventative maintenance
<P>

(3) Failures disclosed by the HAZOPS Study and the ISRS Baseline Audit
<P>

(4) Failure to provide procedures manuals and adequately trained staff 
<P>

(5) Failure to observe the prohibition against the simultaneous operation of
the emulsion manufacturing plant and the detonator
assembly plant
<P>

(6) Failure to provide adequate separation of the various components of the
plant"
<P>

265  	As to the level of knowledge of Dyno relevant to consideration
of the due care clause, it is clear from <b>Furman</b> that the operation of
the clause is not concerned with vicarious liability but with conscious
behaviour of the insured. Niugini Insurance
has submitted that knowledge of
senior management is relevant for the purposes of examining the operation of
the due care clause
and in that respect identified IT Smith and William Huntley
Garson III (Garson) as representing management at sufficient level to
fix Dyno
with relevant knowledge. I accept that contention with the qualification that
the primary level of responsibility lay with
IT Smith and that Garson's change
in responsibilities in 1994 resulted in his last site visit being in April
1994. 
<P>

266  	Garson was the international operations manager of Dyno between
1992 and 1994, in the latter year becoming special projects
manager for Dyno.
He, with IT Smith, attended the inspection by Twaddle and Hood of Dyno's
proposed plant when it was located in
Queensland on the occasion of the
recommissioning of the plant. He evidenced the fact that in relation to the
plant site commissioning
and the locating of the plant at the ICI site, there
was "no other alternative" available to Dyno for that location decision. That
was a product of security requirements in a potentially hostile social
environment and the geographical hostility of the area which
left extremely
limited areas available for works and operations required to support the
project. I do not understand there to be
an issue that the ICI plant and, in
turn, the Dyno plant, was the subject of approval by the Mines Department in
the commissioning
siting and operation stages. 
<P>

267  	Garson gave evidence of the method of staff selection which
clearly showed a high level of appreciation of the need for the
employment of
skilled persons suitable for the tasks. He also evidenced the way in which
expatriate staff were "multi-skilled". He
explained the necessity for this as
the "fly in" system often meant that it was necessary for expatriates whose
specialisation was
in one area to be able to "cover" for other skill areas.
Such staff were the subject of considerable "time and effort" put in by
the
other Dyno employees to ensure that appropriate skills were acquired. He
emphasised the concern that he gave expression to in
obtaining an
"appropriately skilled expatriate workforce". He pointed out that the process
of selection was such that it also required
the approval of the PJV and that
this method of obtaining and approving of staff was an ongoing process at the
time of the explosion.
<P>

268  	In relation to individuals of Dyno's staff who were killed in
the explosion at Porgera, he gave evidence of their personal
qualities as
employees and those descriptions varied between "an excellent employee (with a
possession of) a good range of skills";
"a very good employee and talented
individual"; possession of "specialised skills"; and management skills at the
same level as Garson,
in the case of Phil Knuckey. 
<P>

269  	The processing of the employment of nationals was conducted at
site level, but in all cases with the assistance of the PJV
as there were
significant security issues to be taken into account. Garson, himself,
inspected the site frequently when he would
discuss matters of management with
Dyno's managers, the quality of product, security issues and the performance of
the staff. He
was aware of the regular visits to the site of representatives of
the Mines Department and of maintenance programs put in place by
Dyno. He gave
the following description:
<P>

"Whilst I was International Operations Manager, the maintenance program at the
explosives facility at Porgera consisted of:
<P>

* a maintenance agreement with Boroko Motors with respect to the mobile fleet
(ie, the TTT truck and chassis, the cantor delivery
truck and the forklift).
This was a comprehensive maintenance agreement which included such things as
analysis of oil from the drivetrain
from the mobile fleet;
<P>

* other pieces of equipment which made up the explosives manufacturing facility
(such as pumps, motors, etc), were serviced at regular
intervals as per the
appropriate manuals which accompanied the relevant pieces of machinery. Brad
Givney did general maintenance
around the facility and Brad Givney kept with
him on site documentation with respect to maintenance, works and systems
carried out
by him as well as maintenance manuals on site. I believe such
documentation was destroyed by the explosion of 2 August 1994;
<P>

* in addition, all the expatriate staff members had maintenance skills in their
particular areas and were directed to use those
skills to ensure that the
production facility continued to operate to meet the mine requirements;
<P>

* there were regular visits and training by DWL contractors, such as Peter Hume
(from Capricorn Steel) and Fred Agius (electrical
contractor);
<P>

* maintenance was also carried out by Mike Riley and Harley Bradbury of
Tradestar, who also trained the DWL staff at the Porgera
site."
<P>

270  	He was also aware of inspection of the project by the PJV "loss
prevention officer/health and safety officer". As in the case
of IT Smith,
Garson presented as a highly responsible, diligent executive of Dyno. 
<P>

271  	IT Smith had close involvement in the setting up of the plant,
from the time that it was located and tested at Queensland
to the time it went
to site. He evidenced the constraints imposed by security and terrain and the
ultimate commissioning of the plant
facility being subject to the approval of
the Mines Department. 
<P>

272  	He, too, regularly visited the project to confer with Hood as
the mine manager, to visit the open pit and underground mine,
to inspect the
Dyno facility and to meet with management of Dyno. He recalled seeing nothing
on any of these visits which gave rise
to any concern. 
<P>

273  	He also evidenced the high level of care invoked by Dyno in its
selection of both expatriate and national employees. He said
of their combined
operation that from his "observations on site and from (his) knowledge of the
PJV operation it seemed to (him)
that the PJV had developed a style of working
with the indigenous people that was appropriate for the mine". He further
evidenced
the fact that the "head national" had been supplied by the PJV to
Dyno, and that he had worked on the project since the commencement
of the ICI
operation and had built a national team around him. He remained in Dyno's
employment until the explosion. He evidenced
the existence of an ongoing
training grant for Dyno employees at the mine and spoke of his own knowledge of
the skills of the Dyno
staff. 
<P>

274  	Of particular significance is his evidence concerning the
establishment of an internal auditing system that was put in place,
known as
the ISRS, which is an acronym for International Safety Rating System which is a
system accredited by DNV (Det Norske Veritas).
That internal audit was carried
out in May 1994 and he was instrumental in assigning tasks to implement
remedial steps arising out
of that audit. 
<P>

275  	Of the results of that audit, he gave evidence that he :
<P>

"considered that the resolution of the problems raised by the audit were a high
priority for management and it was important to
ensure that such standards were
then maintained. I considered that it would be beneficial if certain Dyno
managers had a regular
and continuing involvement in the audit process by
attending at the mine at least once each year for the purpose of an annual
review
... I was also concerned myself to monitor the progress of the remedial
measures which were being put in place as a result of the
audit findings and
requested that such material (be) included in the monthly mine reports."
<P>

276  	He gave further evidence of his concern with safety procedures.
He added:
<P>

"I wanted to ensure that safety procedures were followed and people had the
draft procedures to ensure that the operations under
their control were being
performed in accordance with safety procedures."
<P>

277  	In my view, these witnesses were transparently honest and
reliable. Evidenced through IT Smith were several memoranda, of
which he was
the author, which showed a continuing attention to and recognition of the
importance of safety procedures for implementation
at the Porgera project. 
<P>

278  	Considerable emphasis has been placed by Niugini Insurance upon
the contents of two studies, namely the "Hazard and Operability
Study Report"
conducted by consulting risk engineers for Dyno in respect of its Porgera plant
(the HAZOP study) and the "quality
assurance baseline audit" of 11 May 1994
(the baseline audit) conducted internally by Dyno. The HAZOP study was
commissioned by Dyno
in late 1993 and the initial stage was completed on 10
December 1993. The final stage was completed on 10 January 1994. Under the
HAZOP study, 260 items were recorded as calling for some action. In the case of
the baseline audit, that, as I understand it, took
the form of classifications
which accorded with an international standard and was preparatory to an
external ISRS audit. 
<P>

279  	Much has been made of the contents of these reports and the
suggested delay in obtaining them. I suppose it really comes down
to a matter
of perspective, but far from supporting the case of the insurer, the very
existence of these reports as commissioned
by Dyno fly in the face of a case
that seeks to throw at Dyno an allegation of reckless indifference to the lives
and property of
others. 
<P>

280  	The HAZOP study runs for several hundred pages and I note its
recommendations give little comfort to the Niugini Insurance
case. The
recommendations were expressed as follows:
<P>

"From this Hazop study there are a number of recommendations that we would
make. They are as follows:
<P>

1. An external audit review should be undertaken to ensure that all of the
Hazop action items contained in this report are completed
to ensure they have
all been satisfactorily actioned.
<P>

2. The issue of different options available for solving a particular problem to
that identified in this Hazop study should be carefully
considered. Should a
different solution be devised for solving a problem to that already documented,
it should be reviewed in a Hazop
format to ensure that it has not introduced
any other operability or safety issues."
<P>

If there was substance in the case of Niugini Insurance that the conduct of
Dyno's management should be characterised as reckless,
then one would expect to
find it in such recommendations. 
<P>

281  	I am not disposed to examine the detail of the criticisms
offered by Niugini Insurance in relation to the implementation of
the subject
matter of these reports. The evidence of IT Smith is clear that the reports
were seriously taken up and it was a matter
of ongoing implementation following
upon the publication of the report. It was clear from his evidence that
constraints of time and
place took their toll in frustrating the immediate
implementation of all recommendations, but the evidence, I think, is beyond
argument
that there was a responsible and genuine response by management to the
study and that there was an ongoing exercise in place to implement
those
matters reported upon.
<P>

282  	As a further general observation, I see nothing in the least
daunting in the deficiencies identified in the study or the audit
report, in so
far as it is in the nature of the animal that such a report will be critical.
Referring back to the six failures identified
by Niugini Insurance as
evidencing a breach of the due care clause: I propose to address issue one
later in these reasons. 
<P>

283  	As to issue 2, failure to provide a system of preventative
maintenance: the thrust of the evidence was that plant maintenance
was effected
on an as required basis as distinct from periodic scheduled maintenance.
Generally speaking, there was, in my view,
ample attention to maintenance on an
as required basis. At the same time it is clear that preventative maintenance
was preferable
and I think, in particular, significant in relation to the
emulite packaging line to which I will refer under issue 1. 
<P>

284  	I think the evidence of Bradley Givney, who was appointed by
Dyno as its international technician in April 1993, demonstrated
that
commitment of Dyno to the maintenance of its plant and equipment. He had worked
on the commissioning of the Dyno plant in preparatory
work in Queensland during
1992. His first visit to the Porgera project was in about September 1993 where
he prepared a daily checklist
of matters for the plant. In October 1993, he
again visited Porgera and conducted maintenance of the plant during that visit.
In
addition to maintenance, he trained staff in relation to ongoing maintenance
matters. He visited Porgera again in November 1993 for
the carrying out of
maintenance of the plant. He had been involved in the installation of the
mono-pump being part of the emulite
packaging unit. He assisted in the
preparation of the HAZOP study. He described that as a study of "worst case
scenarios". He worked
full time at Porgera from 8 January 1994 until July 1994
with responsibilities for implementing the recommendations of the HAZOP
study.
As part of that task, he performed routine maintenance and provided executive
management with summaries of actions taken.
He was also involved in
implementing the recommendations of the baseline audit. It was his general
evidence that he had completed
the majority of the items referred to in the
audit.
<P>

285  	In relation to the emulite mono-pump, he said that on a
"regular basis of intervals of approximately three to four days, [he]
physically checked by hand, the drive motor, heat tracing and pump condition".
Notwithstanding some shortcomings in the standards
of maintenance and
operations, in fact, implemented by the operations staff, I think the evidence
to which I have referred negates
a charge of recklessness on the part of Dyno
in installing and implementing appropriate measures of maintenance and
operation of
the plant.
<P>

286  	As to issue 3, failures disclosed by the HAZOP study and the
ISRS baseline audit: criticisms were offered as to the lateness
of introducing
this study, of the priority given to Australian sites over the Porgera site, of
the possibility that implementation
of shortcomings may have been implemented
more quickly on the basis of which it was submitted that "Dyno knowingly
courted the risks
expected to be revealed by those studies without taking the
appropriate steps to avert the same by the timely completion of those
studies
and by the timely rectification of the shortcomings that they came to reveal".
I doubt if I need to comment further on that
submission beyond what I have said
in terms of the genuine efforts of Dyno to provide a safe plant and operation
at Porgera.
<P>

287  	As to issue 4, failure to provide procedures, manuals and
adequately trained staff: I have had something to say about the
staff. There
was a comparatively isolated example of a complaint of lack of training with
regard to the manner of selection of staff
and the evidence of the level of
skills of the principal staff members. I think this criticism lacks substance.
It is further dealt
with in relation to issue 1.
<P>

288  	As to issue 5, operation of the emulsion manufacturing and
detonator assembly: the Mines Department required that these activities
not be
carried out concurrently. The evidence established that they were. I think
Garson's evidence is to be accepted that the concurrent
operations of those two
plants took place at times of inspection by officers of the Mines Department
without objection by those officers.
There is a conflict of evidence as to the
safety implications of that concurrent operation. The evidence being that with
concurrent
operations, there was a prospect of detonators being deliberately or
accidentally introduced into the emulsion manufacturing activity.
However, I
tend to think that is somewhat fanciful and that Garson's evidence is to be
accepted that no measurable risk arose out
of the two operations being
performed concurrently. In any event, the practice fell far short of any
concept of reckless indifference
to standards of care that might be expected of
Dyno in the operation of the plant.
<P>

289  	Issue 6, failure to provide adequate separation distances in
location of plant components: this complaint, in my view, fails
to pay any heed
to the dictates of carrying out such an operation within the restricted
confines of the mountainous region in which
the project was situated and
ignores the approval of the operation by the Mines Department. I have dealt
with that issue earlier
in these reasons. 
<P>

290  	The prescription of separation distances for materials and
elements in an explosives plant is neither inflexible nor mandatory
in its
application to the Porgera explosives plant. The standards on which reliance
has been placed by Niugini Insurance admit of
modification by reference to
local conditions. A salient feature of the Porgera explosives plant
installation is the fact that it
was the subject of approval by the Mines
Department in respect of its layout and operation, in the case of both ICI and
Dyno. Further,
both ICI an Dyno were forced to operate within the parameters
dictated by a potentially hostile social environment and significantly
restricted by the topography of the site. Subject to those observations, I see
no substance in this criticism of Dyno's operation.

<P>

291  	My final observation on this aspect is a reference to the
evidence of IT Smith in cross-examination as follows:
<P>

"Q. As you understood it the PJV was looking to Dyno for Dyno's advice as to
how this plant ought to be configured?
<P>

A. In relation to the manufacture of explosives, that's correct.
<P>

Q. As you understood it, the PJV was looking to Dyno to ensure that the
manufacturing process was a safe one?
<P>

A. Yes, sir.
<P>

Q. Did you yourself give any consideration of the proximity - to the proximity
of the matrix to the manufacturing plant?
<P>

A. I gave a great deal of consideration to the overall layout of the plant
including that aspect of it."
<P>

(T431.51-432.9)
<P>

292  	The next is issue 1, problems with the emulite packout
mono-pump: the significance of this issue lies in the fact that I am
satisfied
that a malfunction in the emulite packaging mono-pump was the cause of the
initial explosion which led to the explosion
in the adjacent emulsion tanks and
that the site operators had forewarning of some malfunction. 
<P>

293  	I have made reference earlier to the Gunnarson and Perlid
reports. Clearly, special care was demanded in the pumping process
involved in
the packaging of the emulite. I think that is common ground. Certainly IT Smith
did not quarrel with that approach. Indeed,
he acknowledged an awareness of
explosions which had occurred throughout the world and which had been
associated with the pumping
of emulsions. When account is taken of the process
involved at the Porgera Dyno plant, namely the pumping of emulsion which was
sensitised
and subjected to conditions of pressure and heat, the imperative of
having adequate safety procedures in place is quite obvious.

<P>

294  	Michael Cechanski (Cechanski) was a chemical engineer on Dyno's
staff with over twenty years experience in the explosives
industry. He held
Master of Science degrees in chemical engineering and chemical technology. He
had been involved in the devising
of an appropriate formula for the bulk
emulsion and sensitised emulsion to be used in the project. In July 1993 he
attended the project
site to review the manufacturing operation with the aim of
"ensuring product quality and provide training to...operators in the area
of
Emulite and emulsion manufacturing." He returned to the site in September 1993
"to assist in the manufacture of the regular formulation
of Emulite 100 which
had not been previously manufactured...also to oversee the general operation of
the modified plant and to review
product performance." 
<P>

295  	Each of those visits was the subject of a report to Garson. The
July report included the following recommendations:
<P>

"* Heat tracing and insulation of fuel lines starting with fuel tank and
continuing all the product line up to Mono pump. It is
advisable to improve the
insulation on fuel tank to protect the system from congealing in case of
stoppages, break-downs further
down the line.
<P>

* Install pressure gauges (line pressures)
<P>

* Install automatic pressure cut-out sensors.
<P>

* Install temp. cut-out sensors on fuel tank.
<P>

* Install temp. cut-out sensors on product line
<P>

<u>Low</u> - to prevent pumping cooled product 
<P>

<u>High</u> - to prevent overheating
<P>

* Install a 2nd nozzle or an efficient cartridging unit (type Autoflex or other
type)
<P>

The latter would improve the yields and quality of the final product.
<P>

* Still we have to remember that long pumping distance (different from NPI,
Kalgoorlie, Bajool) builds up pressures, which we'd
rather like to avoid. This
will remain to be a difficulty from operational and safety point. Pumps must
<u>never</u> be allowed to go dry. Re-starting must only be permitted for a
cleaned out product line.
<P>

* The <u>firmer</u> product will put <u>more strain</u> on the whole plant and
operation. The high processing temperatures will follow the product all the way
through to the plastic film.
Consequently, ambient cooling will be required
before inserting cartridges in the boxes.
<P>

* No steel scrapers should be used when cleaning product line. Supply adequate
tools from Australia.
<P>

* Site should be provided with a buffer of spares, type:
<P>

- pumps, motors
<P>

- rotameters
<P>

- pressure / temp. gauges
<P>

- additional water heater for new fuel line"
<P>

296  	The September report contained the following:
<P>

"3. * Heat tracing and insulation worked OK and kept the product's temperature
within the range.
<P>

* It is suggested that Emulite 100 should not be pumped if its temperature is
bellow (sic) 80C.
<P>

* The product can be kept hot over some time, however it is recommended to have
each produced batch packed out during the same day.
<P>

* Hydraulically regulated and independently (sic) set up doubble-nozzle (sic)
system should facilitate a more efficient filling
and packing operation.
<P>

* Temperature and pressure gauges should be installed on the pumps used for
product."
<P>

297  	It appears that the recommendations for the provision of
pressure and temperature gauges were responded to and those gauges
were
delivered to the site in November 1993. However, it required a malfunction of
the mono-pump on 9 February 1994 to cause the
gauges to be installed. 
<P>

298  	The incident involving the emulite plant mono-pump on 9
February 1994 was the subject of a report by an investigating committee
comprising Messrs Pitt, Wynne, Pledger and Dyer. Although Wynne and Dyer were
killed in the explosion, and as earlier noted, Pitt
was removed from the site
prior to the explosion, the evidence disclosed that Pledger was employed with a
related corporation of
Dyno in New Zealand at the time of the hearing. Neither
Pitt nor Pledger were called to give evidence, a matter upon which counsel
for
Niugini Insurance has commented adversely in relation to Dyno's case on the due
care issue. There is no suggestion that either
was unavailable to give
evidence. However, I think the absence from the witness box of those two
witnesses has to be viewed separately
in considering, respectively, the due
care issue and the negligence case brought by the PJV against Dyno. The
significance of the
absence of these two men from the witness box is addressed
later in these reasons.
<P>

299  	In reporting on the 9 February 1994 incident, the investigating
committee described the incident as follows: 
<P>

"The emulite pack out monopump was inadvertingtly (sic) activated and allowe
(sic) to run for approx 3 hours. Smoke was seen to
be coming from pump. There
was no product in the hopper." 
<P>

(Exhibit D2-1 Document 11)
<P>

Having in mind the technical papers earlier quoted in these reasons stressing
the dangers of the preparation of emulsion under pressure
and Cechanski's
stricture that "Pumps must <u>never</u> be allowed to go dry." The
investigating committee's description of the occurrence should be treated as an
alarming one.
<P>

300  	For the better understanding of this evidence concerning the
likely mechanics of the explosions there was admitted into evidence
a
photograph in cross-section of the mono-pump (schedule 3 to these reasons); a
photograph in cross-section of the rotor head section
(schedule 4) and a sketch
of the hopper and mono-pump (schedule 5). Different experts were not adverse to
using interchangeable words
of description for the same elements in the emulite
mono-pump.
<P>

301  	A simple description of the operation of the emulite packaging
plant may be useful in addressing the evidence relating to
the mechanics of the
explosions. 
<P>

302  	The sensitised emulsion known as emulite was fed via a hopper
system to an inlet which is described as the suction port, element
5 in the
photograph, schedule 3. The emulite has a viscosity likened to that of
toothpaste and required the application of pressure
and heat to facilitate its
passage through the packaging line by a rotation of the flexishaft, which is
element 4 in the photograph.
That rotation in turn caused the rotor section and
the rotor shaft to revolve, they being elements identified as 6 and D,
respectively.
The rotor shaft or rotor scroll revolved within the stator, which
is element 3. 
<P>

303  	Although schedule 4 is not a particularly well exposed
photograph, viewed in conjunction with the photograph in schedule 3,
it gives a
better understanding of the operation of the rotor in the vicinity of elements
6 and C where shown in schedule 3. 
<P>

In schedule 4 the section shown as the rotor head, or rotor boss, which is
really an extension of the rotor scroll, is the area
shown as a U shaped black
section marked as section 6 and "C" on schedule 3. The flexishaft in schedule 3
is covered in a black "elastomeric
polymer" to a point where the flexishaft
becomes embedded within the rotor section. That can be seen in both schedules.
The way in
which the elements are locked together in the rotor section is
comparatively simple. The "U" of the rotor head fits snuggly over
the t-shaped
section known as the rotor adaptor. 
<P>

304  	The flexishaft fits into the rotor adaptor. This is effected by
having a narrowing tapered inlet in the adaptor which conforms
in shape with
the tapered steel end of the flexishaft. In schedule 3 there can be seen a
flexishaft bolt. That bolt is located in
a space formed between the head of the
adaptor and the bottom of the U in the rotor head. That space is known as the
rotor head cavity.
That bolt is shown as passing through a washer and threaded
into the hollow threaded end of the flexishaft. By tightening the bolt,
the
flexishaft is drawn into an immovable position within the adaptor and in turn
within the rotor head. Internal screws bind the
end of the U legs of the rotor
head to the T element of the adaptor so that the flexishaft, the adaptor and
the rotor head are as
one unit. 
<P>

305  	In schedule 3 seals are shown in the joint at the end of the
legs of the rotor where they join the adaptor T-section. There
is a similar
seal identified in Schedule 4 as an O ring and another seal identified in
schedule 4 as the flange gasket. 
<P>

306  	The configuration of these elements and the various seals are
designed to exclude material from the interior of the rotor
section, in
particular, from the rotor head cavity and the adjacent cavity, known as the
flexishaft cavity. The seals are also designed
to preclude the intrusion of
compounds under the polymer covering so as to avoid corrosion of the
flexishaft. 
<P>

307  	It is axiomatic that malfunctioning can lead to increased
pressure which in turn converts into increased temperature, both
of which may
be viewed as highly undesirable developments in the operation of packaging
emulite. The investigating committee's report
outlined the steps taken by
Dyno's operators after the 9 February 1994 incident as follows: 
<P>

"The pump was turned off &amp; cooled with water.
<P>

Approx 5 hours later, pump was disasemble (sic) and inspected. There was (sic)
no visible signs of any damage to rotor or stator.
Seals appeared to be
intact."
<P>

308  	I do not think it is suggested that each of the elements
joining the rotorshaft and the flexishaft into one unit should have
been
completely dismantled. Nevertheless, the severity of the malfunction was such
as to require, in my view, a most thorough examination
of the emulite packaging
plant. Given the presence of smoke during the malfunction, one would
immediately think of extreme temperatures,
distortions to the metal in the
rotor section and damage to the various seals. The investigating committee's
report on causation
was in the following terms: 
<P>

"IMMEDIATE CAUSE:- 1) IN SITU CONTROL VALVE HAD MAKESHIFT 
<P>

HANDLE WHICH COMRISED OF A PAIR OF VICE
<P>

GRIPS LOCKED ONTO VALVE SHAFT.
<P>

2) MAIN CONTROL VALVE ON PANEL IN DISCUSSION REVEALED THAT WHEN HYDRAULIC POWER
SOURCE ACTIVATED ON SOME PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, THE
SECONDARY CONTROL VALVE HAD
TURNED ITSELF ON.
<P>

BASIC CAUSES:- 1) PLANT IS AN "OLD PLANT" THAT HAS BEEN 
<P>

RECOMMISSIONED. VALVING WAS NOT REPLACED
<P>

DURING RECOMMISSIONING. 
<P>

2) PLANT HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTLY MAINTAINED SINCE BEING RECOMMISSIONED. ONLY
MAKESHIFT REPAIRS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT.
<P>

3) NO SAFETYINTERLOCKS FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE OR PRESSURE IN SYSTEM.
<P>

4) NO PROCESS HAZOPS CARRIED OUT PRIOR TO 
<P>

PLANT START UP. (A PROCESS HAZOPS HAS RECENTLY BEEN CARRIED OUT BUT
RECOMMENDATIONS TOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
<P>

5) NO PROCEDURES FOR OPERATIONS IN PLACE.
<P>

6) NO FORMAL OPERATOR TRAINING IN PLACE
<P>

RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>

1) REPAIR/ PLACE ALL VALVING SO THAT ON/OFF &amp; FLOW CONTROLLERS WORK
CORRECTLY BY 10.3.94 
<P>

2) PUT IN PLACE A PROCEDURE TO ENSURE THAT 
<P>

a) ALL HYDRALIC (sic) CIRCUITS ALL CLOSED PRIOR TO ACTIVATING HYDRALIC (sic)
PACK
<P>

b) CHECK THAT NO CIRCUITS HAVE BEEN INADVERTANTLY ACTIVATED DURING START
UP..."
<P>

309  	It is not underestimating the seriousness of this incident to
say that the recommendations of the investigating committee,
in my view,
suffered from overstatement and were, in some respects, selective when it is
borne in mind that the temperature and pressure
of valves which had been
provided by Dyno in November 1993 as a result of the Cechanski report had not
been installed prior to this
malfunction in February 1994. 
<P>

310  	Pitt's description of the plant as "an old plant" I think
should not be taken too seriously. The plant had been properly recommissioned,
water tested, and subjected to inspection and approval of the Mines Department.
Further, I find it difficult to understand how Pitt
could be heard to say that
the plant had not been correctly maintained since being recommissioned given
his sphere of responsibility.
<P>

311  	I think my earlier findings as to the maintenance procedures in
place are sufficient to place in context the substance of
the investigating
committee's comments on maintenance procedures. 
<P>

312  	I think a favourable overall impression may be gained as to the
concern of Dyno management with safety and product quality
standards in
relation to the Porgera Dyno operations from the evidence of Scott Bartlett, an
employee of Dyno with a background as
a research chemist. He had visited the
Porgera site on four occasions prior to the explosion, the last being on 2-8
May 1994. Although
his expertise lay primarily in product quality, he was also
involved in the training of expatriate employees involved in product
manufacture at Porgera and in implementation of safety procedures arising out
of the HAZOP study and the baseline audit. In the performance
of his duties, he
gained a familiarity with the competence of the Dyno staff at the plant and I
think it is clear from that evidence
that Dyno's selection of staff resulted in
the employment of a high level of skills and competence in their respective
roles. 
<P>

313  	He gave the following general evidence of his observations:
<P>

"My overall impression of the Dyno operation at Porgera based upon my site
visits and many dealings with Bill Garson III and those
on site, was that
everyone wanted to achieve the ISRS accreditation and to remedy any problems
with the plant. The team up there
was a fairly close knit unit and I always had
the impression that they wanted to do their respective jobs as well as they
could.
I know from conversations I had with Phil Knuckey who was running the
Plant at the time of the explosion that he was very anxious
to sort out all of
the problems identified in the ISRS Audit and to achieve the quality
accreditation so that a new Plant Manager
could be employed and he could return
to Cairns. I was involved in working with Phil in that process and I spent a
lot of my time
between May and August 1994 attempting to achieve those
objectives."
<P>

314  	At the same time the "makeshift" method of operating the
control valve and the attendant capacity of the secondary control
valve to
self-engage were clearly matters of serious moment having regard to the
importance of the control of flow of the emulite
through the packaging system.

<P>

315  	In May of 1994 there was a further malfunction with the pump in
that a foot control switch failed and the needle on the pressure
gauge had to
be put back in place on several occasions. I think those incidents are of no
particular significance apart from a possible
indication of the need for a
higher level of maintenance to prevent those occurrences. 
<P>

316  	However, there was a series of incidents in the month preceding
the explosions which are of particular concern. A number of
discs on the
mono-pump ruptured within a space of twelve hours with five discs rupturing
over a two to three day period. The discs
were actually designed to rupture
under conditions of excessive pressure within the mono-pump. The discs, in
fact, were known as
"burst disks". It also appears that no new replacement
discs were available until the week prior to the explosions. In the meantime,
a
"temporary disk" had been used. 
<P>

317  	The incident in February 1994, and the rupturing of the discs
in July 1994 were the subject of a post-explosion inquiry by
one D A Abrahams,
an employee of Dyno, on 26 October 1994. On that date he had a telephone
conversation with Pledger concerning the
operation of the mono-pump and his
file note of that conversation was as follows:
<P>

<b>"NOTE TO FILE: CRAIG PLEDGER</b>
<P>

Rang Craig 26th October 1994 10.45 hrs to discuss Pack-out Mono Pump
incident.
<P>

Gave Craig an overview of findings.
<P>

Asked Craig what he could tell me regarding the Mono Pump incident which
occurred in February.
<P>

Pump running for 2 hours plus
<P>

70m nozzle connected, steam coming out end of nozzle.
<P>

Removed 70m nozzle started to flush with water into and over discharge end and
pumped water through hopper into the other end
<P>

Pump left to cool down, was not stripped down that day.
<P>

Went back on truck. Brad examined it the next day with Trevor. No parts
changed. Sure Brad [Givney] was there.
<P>

Removed end plate to check if any damage to stater rather than the rotar (sic)
or flexi shaft. Duncan [Wilson] was on field-break.
<P>

DA: Are you aware of anybody doing anything to the Mono Pump after the incident
in February ?
<P>

CP: After the temperature and pressure gauges were fitted, no.
<P>

Definitely not to my knowledge.
<P>

DA: Are you sure that Duncan or Merv [Wynne] did not compleltely (sic) strip
the Mono Pump ?
<P>

CP: No, No, nothing like that was done to my knowledge.
<P>

CP: Could the problem with the burst discs have anything to do with it ?
<P>

DA: I don't know, it is still to early to say at this stage.
<P>

Metalurgical (sic) analysis are still being conducted.
<P>

Can you tell me about the 5 burst discs going in 12 hrs ?
<P>

Craig over 2 - 3 days.
<P>

DA: Were there any other incidents ?
<P>

CP: No, not to my knowledge. Merv fitted a temporary disc which held.
<P>

DA: What can you tell me about the burst discs suddenly going ?
<P>

CP: Burst discs went for several reasons.
<P>

Product going hard over smoko breaks.
<P>

Nozzle not cleaned out at end of shift.
<P>

Pump rotation not set to correct speed 70m V 30m
<P>

Untrained and new employees.
<P>

DA: The new burst discs arrived on 28 July, PJV Store withdrawn on 29 July by
someone from DWL. Would they have been fitted ?
<P>

CP: Yes, definitely. Merv was not happy about running the pump with the
temporary disc."
<P>

318  	Just dealing with the record of Pledger stating that neither
Wilson nor Wynne had completely stripped the mono-pump after
the 9 February
1994 malfunction: it is not particularly easy to reconcile that with the report
of the investigating committee of
that incident nor of the evidence of Garson.
According to his evidence he took the following action:
<P>

<b>"February 1994 Incident</b>
<P>

40. On 9 February 1994, I recall that the DWL site manager at Porgera informed
me that the monopump in the emulite packaging line
had overheated. He told me
that a large amount of smoke or steam had been observed billowing out of the
pump. I further recall that
he told me that personnel on site had shut the pump
down and put water on it to cool it. He said the pump had probably been running
for about four to five hours at a low rpm. I said to Trevor Pitt words to the
following effect: "I want the whole pump totally stripped
and inspected and any
damaged parts replaced." Following this, I immediately informed the General
Manager, International, Ian Smith
and Phil Knuckey, of the incident. At this
time I also instructed Phil Knuckey to advise the PJV Mine Manager of the
incident."
<P>

Perhaps the difference lies in the emphasis of the question, whether Wilson or
Wynne had "completely" stripped the mono-pump. 
<P>

319  	There was the further evidence of Givney that it was he who
installed the mono-pump in the emulite packaging line in 1993
and oversaw the
installation of the temperature and pressure gauges in February 1994. He had
been informed of the overheating of
the mono-pump in that incident when he was
in Australia, and on his return to Porgera on 21 February 1994 he discussed the
matter
with Pitt who informed Givney that he and Wynne had "pulled the pump
down but found no damage to the rotor or stator". After the
9 February 1994
incident Givney also had a conversation with Wynne in which he was informed
that it was he who "actually dismantled
the pump" and told Givney that "there
had been no damage to the rotor or the stator". 
<P>

320  	Givney gave evidence of the experience of Wynne and Pitt in
respect of the pump and he was prepared to accept the reliability
of the
information given to him in that way concerning the malfunction of the pump. He
gave the following further evidence: 
<P>

"35. I also believe it was steam rather than smoke due to the low rpm and the
amount of water in the DNAP products. I closely observed
the operation of the
pump in the following weeks. There was no observable change in the operation of
the pump or its output and the
pump appeared to be operating satisfactorily.
This, in my opinion, confirmed that the pump had not been damaged. 
<P>

36. On a regular basis of intervals of approximately three to four days, I
physically checked by hand, the drive motor, heat tracing
and pump condition.

<P>

37. I left the site on 9 July 1994 and Duncan Wilson was nominated as the
mechanical tradesman on site. There was a list of daily
checks to be carried
out and part of that was visual inspection of all plant and equipment. See
document "BG7". This was a summary
of the daily check lists I have devised
together with a list of work to be completed."
<P>

321  	It appears that Givney left the site prior to the incidents in
late July when the five burst discs failed. I think the correct
conclusion to
reach is that there was some dismantling of the pump following the 9 February
1994 incident, the extent of which is
imprecise, and that it did not amount to
a complete dismantling of the emulite packaging elements. 
<P>

322  	Notwithstanding the favourable impression I gained from Givney
as a witness who was direct and responsive in answers in cross-examination,
I
have serious reservations as to the adequacy of the response to the 9 February
1994 incident given the seriousness of Cechanski's
stricture in relation to the
pump being allowed to run dry and the conventional wisdom in the industry as to
the danger of processing
explosives materials under pressure. 
<P>

323  	I accept the evidence of Givney that he continued to observe
the operation of the emulite plant after the 9 February 1994
incident and that
he was satisfied that there was no malfunction. However, I think adverse
inferences should be drawn against Dyno
arising out of its failure to call
witnesses to evidence the precise remedial steps taken by Dyno in the aftermath
of malfunctions
to the emulite packaging plant in February, May and July 1994.
While that may not be so in the due care case, vis-a-vis Niugini Insurance,
I
think that it is a reasonable observation in the negligence case between Dyno
and the PJV. 
<P>

324  	Some force I think is given to that criticism when regard is
had to the seriously irregular operation of the packaging plant
a matter of
days prior to the explosion. It may well be that the rupturing of the burst
discs demonstrates the function of those
fittings but to have five rupturing in
the space of two days or so and the resort to some home made replacement
pending receipt of
new discs reflected a significant malfunction of the machine
in the packaging line and, in my view, an inappropriate response to
it by its
operators. 
<P>

325  	It is common ground that the initial explosion occurred in the
emulite packaging plant and I have no doubt that a cause of
that ultimate
failure lay in a defect in the emulite packaging process which may or may not
have had an association with the effects
on the plant of the 9 February 1994
incident, but which was manifested in the rupturing of the burst discs shortly
prior to the explosion,
and which, in my opinion, received no adequate
attention on site. 
<P>

326  	In my view, there should be no underestimating the seriousness
of the underlying cause of the rupturing of the discs. It may
be a matter of no
consequence that a burst disc will rupture very occasionally. However, to have
several discs rupture in a short
space of time, clearly, I think, indicated a
malfunction in the mono-pump packing line that required investigation. 
<P>

327  	The fact is that site personnel did not convey this malfunction
to Garson or IT Smith prior to the explosions. While the conduct
of site
personnel, I think, left something to be desired, a charge of recklessness
against Dyno on the basis of the conduct of IT
Smith or Garson is not
warranted. I have been invited to reject Garson's evidence that he was not
informed of the rupturing of the
discs prior to the explosions. It was not put
to him that he had been so informed and, in any event, I have no reason to
disbelieve
Garson or IT Smith in any aspect of their evidence. 
<P>

328  	For those reasons, I am satisfied that Dyno was not guilty of a
breach of the due care clause of the endorsed policy. I am
satisfied that there
was a genuine and high level of concern for safety and maintenance procedures
on site as evidenced by the commissioning
of the baseline audit and the
external HAZOP study, by the very substantial response by Dyno to the latter,
and by Dyno's rectification
of the vast majority of the items referred to in
that study by mid 1994. The fact remains, however, that the maintenance
procedures
and responses on site to malfunctions in the emulite packaging unit
were deficient.
<P>

329  	It is not entirely surprising having regard to the complete
devastation of the plant that a public inquiry into the causes
of the
explosions resulted in an inconclusive report. In these proceedings, while
there has been acceptance of the fact that the
explosion occurred in the
emulite packaging line the experts called in the respective cases of Niugini
Insurance and Dyno have been
unable to offer a definitive analysis explaining
the initiation of the explosion. The debate has been more one of a difference
of
opinion as to the precise area of initiation within the packaging line, with
Dyno's expert locating it in the rotor head cavity.
Niugini Insurance's expert
places it in the packaging line outside of the rotor head. 
<P>

330  	Dyno called in its case Robert Collins Barnes (Barnes), the
principal of Robert Barnes &amp; Associates, Forensic Consultants.
His
disciplines lay in the fields of metallurgy, engineering and chemistry. He had
extensive experience in the investigation of explosions.
In his statement of
evidence he explained the detail of his investigation of the explosion
following his retainer by Dyno on 7 October
1994 which resulted in a report of
21 December 1994. He described the various tests which he caused to be carried
out during the
course of that investigation and excluded causes of the
explosion in various segments of the plant, as to which there was no dispute.
Nor is there any dispute as to his conclusion that the explosion was initiated
in the emulite packaging line and, in particular,
in the mono-pump. 
<P>

331  	Where the experts are at issue is in the opinion expressed by
Barnes that there was a crack defect in the interior of the
mono-pump which
permitted an explosion of emulite within the pump to "propagate to the emulite
contained around the scroll of the
pump" from which all other detonations or
explosions emanated. 
<P>

332  	His opinion of the anatomy of the explosion within the
mono-pump is strongly challenged by Dr John William Howard Price (Price),
an
expert with impeccable qualifications in chemical engineering. Shortly after
the explosions, he was retained by Mono Pumps (Australia)
Pty Ltd (Mono) to
provide mechanical engineering and metallurgical support for their
investigations into the explosions. As part
of that retainer he participated in
a series of explosion tests on a mono-pump of a similar type to that in use at
Porgera. It was
his role to ascertain whether the cause of the explosions was
due to some design or manufacturing fault or defect within the mono-pump.
<P>

333  	No expert suggests otherwise than that there are dangers
associated with the process of packaging explosive material such
as those of
emulite under pressure and in conditions of applied heat. Neither is it
disputed that a build up of pressure may give
rise to increased temperatures
within the packaging line. 
<P>

334  	While experiments conducted by Price on behalf of Mono
experienced considerable difficulty in causing emulite to explode under
conditions of extreme heat, I am reasonably satisfied that the seat of the
explosion is to be found in the undetected increased temperature
of the
atmosphere in the emulite packaging line, probably the result of a dangerous
increase of pressure in the mono-pump. Price's
difficulty in replicating the
explosion may well be explained by irregularity in the level of sensitivity of
the emulite actually
involved in the explosion. There is nothing to dissuade
one from those views by the evidence that in May 1994 the needle on the
pressure
gauge had fallen off "on a number of occasions" which had "resulted in
an over pressure state not being recognised by the alarm system..."

<P>

335  	Although considerable evidence was adduced of a technical
nature through experts called in the respective cases of Dyno and
Niugini
Insurance, I have not felt compelled to examine that evidence in detail,
principally because Dyno and Niugini Insurance seemed
more intent on disputing
the mechanics of the explosions rather than exposing the cause of the
explosions. 
<P>

336  	While it is not possible to state precisely what caused the
explosions, there is little doubt in my mind that Dyno operators
had been given
serious forewarning of a malfunction in the emulite packaging line only a
matter of days before the explosions. I
am satisfied that the malfunction was
neither reported to senior management nor made the subject of any adequate
investigation and
rectification. 
<P>

337  	The nature of that malfunction was such, in my view, as to
strongly indicate a connection with the circumstances of the explosion:
evidencing, as it did, a persistent and significant recurrence of an undetected
pressure increase and consequent raising of temperature
in the emulite
processing. Except for Price's difficulty in initiating an explosion of emulite
by the application of heat, I would
have little problem in finding that the
irregularity in pressure build-up in the packaging line with attendant
application of excessive
heat was sufficient explanation for the explosions. On
the balance of probabilities I remain of that view notwithstanding that
particular
evidence of Price. 
<P>

338  	If it was necessary to find another factor to reconcile my
finding with that evidence of Price, it is to be found in the likely
presence
of an irregularly high level of sensitivity in the emulite arising from
insufficient control over the sensitising process:
a factor which would have
facilitated the igniting of the emulite under the conditions of unplanned
pressure and temperature build
up. That is the very circumstance referred to in
the Gunnarson report in warning of the "extremely hazardous" nature of the
"pumping
of emulsion explosives" evidenced by accidents which probably also
involved "unwanted and unknown sensitizing."
<P>

339  	The PJV's case against Dyno in respect of the material damage
and business interruption claims is one of res ipsa loquitur.
Upon the evidence
as presented by the PJV I think it is such a case. Niugini Insurance's primary
submission in its 'due care' case
postulated that satisfaction of the due care
clause is a condition precedent to its liability under the policy and that it
is sufficient
to show breach unrelated to the subject loss. Notwithstanding,
the Court was invited to make a finding on causation that "on the
balance of
probabilities (the first explosion) was caused by a malfunction in the Emulite
pack-out mono pump." The submissions recited
the principal failures of the
mono-pump mentioned earlier in these reasons. In respect of those earlier
malfunctions it was submitted
that Dyno failed "adequately to address the
problem with the pump." To the extent as found in these reasons I agree with
that contention.
In that context Niugini Insurance relied upon the Gunnarson
report and the evidence of Trevor Anthony Cowper (Cowper). He was an
expert
with special qualifications in chemistry and metallurgy. He had spent forty
years with ICI in which he gained considerable
experience in explosives and
attendant safety features in handling. He participated at committee level in
working groups responsible
for the formulation of Australian standards and
codes relating to storage and transporting of explosives. He was clearly very
well
qualified to give expert evidence on the subject of the handling of the
emulite on site by Dyno. He criticised the layout of the
Dyno plant in respects
that I think have been adequately addressed earlier in these reasons. 
<P>

340  	During re-examination he offered the following expert evidence,
which I think is consistent with my earlier findings on the
cause of the
explosions and puts into context Price's evidence of testing to replicate an
explosion of emulite: 
<P>

"&lt;RE-EXAMINATION BY MR FORSTER :
<P>

MR FORSTER: Q. Mr Cowper, at one stage in your cross-examination by my learned
friend, you were asked something to the effect of
whether the introduction of
heat may have some safety factor in the manufacturing process?
<P>

A. Yes
<P>

Q. I think you said in answer to one question something to the effect of "there
is a little bit more to it than that"?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Do you remember saying that?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Could you explain to the court what you wanted to add to the answer you gave
at the time?
<P>

A. Well, certainly a cold emulsion is more difficult to pump than a hot
emulsion. When you go to apply heat to an emulsion, one
of the problems is that
the emulsion is a very poor conductor of heat, so if your method of applying
heat is such that you can get
a high temperature localised heating, you are
introducing a hazard that way, so you need to introduce heat in such a way that
there
is an inbuilt maximum temperature that can be achieved by that heating
method. 
<P>

You have to bear in mind that it is very difficult to agitate and it is quite
possible that where you are applying the heat, the
temperature is quite
different to where you are measuring the temperature of the matrix.
<P>

Q. If that uniformity of heat is not maintained what consequences might
follow?
<P>

A. If you overheat, the matrix can start to decompose. If you, say, pump into a
dead head, nothing is going through the pump, the
hotter the matrix the less
time you have to switch the pump off.
<P>

Q. Is there anything else, or is that the answer to the question?
<P>

A. That is the answer to the question.
<P>

Q. Thank you. You were also asked some questions --
<P>

HIS HONOUR: Q. Just to understand; what is the consequence of it (sic) 
<P>

decomposition?
<P>

A. Under confinement, if you keep putting the heat in, you generate gases and
something will go. It will either explode, blow bits
of pipe everywhere or
worst case it could detonate, which is more violent."
<P>

(T 1601.23-1602.22)
<P>

341  	As to the proper standard of care to be applied in the PJV's
negligence case, the parties appear to be in agreement that the
test is that
stated in <b>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd</b><i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
179 CLR 520:</a> the relevant principle being stated as follows: 
<P>

"...a person who takes advantage of his or her control of premises to introduce
a dangerous substance, to carry on a dangerous activity,
or to allow another to
do one of those things, owes a duty of reasonable care to avoid a reasonably
foreseeable risk of injury or
damage to the person or property of another. In a
case where the person or property of the other person is lawfully in a place
outside
the premises that duty of care both varies in degree according to the
magnitude of the risk involved and extends to ensuring that
such care is
taken." (at 556-557)
<P>

342  	The private international law rules to be applied to the PJV's
cause of action in negligence has not been the subject of controversy
in this
case as I understand the submissions presented by the parties. In any case,
whether the rule in <b>Phillips v Eyre</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281870%29%20LR%206%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1870) LR 6 QB 1</a>, as applied in

case, has no significance.
<P>

343  	However, I am unaware of any evidence or submissions relating
to the law of torts as applied in the lex loci actus namely,
that of Papua New
Guinea. On that premise I have proceeded on the presumption that the law of
Papua New Guinea does not differ from
the law of this State.
<P>

344  	The application of the principle in <b>Burnie </b>leaves me in
no doubt that the standard of care required of Dyno was such that the
"magnitude of the risk" demanded a very high standard
of care, bordering upon
an absolute duty to ensure that an explosion was not initiated in the emulite
packaging line.
<P>

345  	It should be clear from my earlier findings that such a
standard of care was not met by Dyno's site operators of the plant.
In
consequence I have not found it necessary to consider any liability of Dyno to
the PJV in contract, or in nuisance. 
<P>

346  	Niugini Insurance has invited an approach to the explosions
which involved distinguishing between the two explosions: the
first explosion
being that of the emulite in the mono-pump packaging line: the other the
explosion of the adjacent tanks of emulsion
under the effect of the fire
initiated by the first explosion. 
<P>

347  	The principal reason for dissecting the mechanics of the
explosion in this way, lay in the case presented by Niugini Insurance
that the
layout of the plant did not conform to industry standards: the corollary being
that, had those standards been observed,
the distance of the emulsion tanks
from the emulite packaging line would have minimised the risk of a second
explosion. I think I
have adequately dealt with the Niugini Insurance case
based upon that criticism of Dyno's layout. In brief, I think that criticism
lacked reality by a) its failure to recognise that the standards are neither
mandatory nor peremptory - they are flexible and may
be departed from; b) its
failure to pay any sufficient regard to the evidence of severe topographical
restrictions within which Dyno
was required to accommodate its plant layout; c)
its failure to recognise or give sufficient effect to the role of the Mines
Department
in approving the plant, its layout and supervising the Dyno
operation. 
<P>

348  	The PJV's material damage claim has been the subject of
agreement as to quantum. The extent of that agreement may have to
be clarified
so far as that claim comprised a category described as "Revised Schedule 2:
Miscellaneous", part of the PJV's submissions.
It was stated by counsel for the
PJV during submissions on 25 May 1999 as follows:
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN:] Can I hand to your Honour, and distribute to my friends, a
revised schedule 2 and schedule 3. The revised schedule
2 sets out the figures
which were agreed in the document I handed up in the second or third week of

and the plaintiffs, and the interest has been
updated to 30 June 1999. Schedule 3 sets out the figures in Mr Weldon's report
with
the interest he calculated up to 30 June 1999."

B.2 The only outstanding issues in relation to quantum of the material damage
claim brought by the PJV on its own behalf are as
follows:
<P>

(a) whether any judgment awarded against Dyno should be in Kina or US
dollars;
<P>

(b) whether the PJV is entitled to recover the amount of USD1,032,995 or its
kina equivalent at the date of expenditure in respect
of the cost of
reinstatement of the building owned by the PJV at the Dyno site, being the
amount paid over and above the amount of
USD808,235 which was paid by NIC in
respect of the destroyed building;
<P>

(c) whether the PJV is entitled to recover an amount for overheads above the
10% already paid in respect of the items which have
been paid by the NIC;
<P>

B.3 It is assumed that the amount of USF808,235 was paid by NIC to the PJV in
respect of the Dyno building at the Dyno site and
that the balance of the claim
for which the PJV has the responsibility of proving is for an amount of
USD1,032,995."

351  	During oral submissions on behalf of the PJV the item,
"Temporary officers/power", was treated as follows:
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN:] The next item, on the previous page, page 3, paragraph 8 deals
with an issue which was at one time raised concerning
temporary offices and
power costs. If your Honour would put a line through paragraph 8, that issue no
longer arises in light of the
agreement between us and Dyno as to the amount
owing - or the amount properly claimed for temporary offices and power costs.
So paragraph
8 can be deleted in its entirety."
<P>

(T 1994.21-T1994.29)
<P>

352  	While the schedules produced by Dyno and the PJV included an
amount in respect of this item in the sum of US$89,804 I have
treated that item
as one which should be omitted. If I have misunderstood the agreement between
the parties, that is a matter that
may be brought to my attention prior to
entry of judgment.
<P>

353  	In addition to the revised schedule 2 items, the PJV seeks
recovery of the cost of rebuilding the explosives facility buildings
over and
above its recovery from Niugini Insurance in respect of the loss of those
facilities. The claim is for US$1,154,798 (the
betterment claim). The PJV also
seeks the inclusion of a component for overheads of 16%. Where the PJV has
recovered an overhead
component in respect of the items the subject of the
subrogation claim under the settlement deed, the PJV has allowed that as a set
off, but claims against Dyno the balance unpaid. The PJV overheads were paid by
Niugini Insurance at the rate of 10%. Further issues
arise out of
quantification of the PJV's claim in US dollars and an interest claim on any
judgment to which it may become entitled,
calculated at the interest rates
currently contained in Schedule J to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules 1970</a>.
<P>

354  	In respect of the material damage claim, Dyno has raised a
defence based upon a construction of the Dyno contract that, stated
briefly,
would limit the PJV's entitlement to damages to the recovery of losses under
the cl 15.2 insurance and those covered by
the cl 15 indemnity. I think it is
not doing an injustice to the argument by limiting my rejection of it to the
observation that
such a construction would require the clearest of limitation
words, whereas the Dyno contract is silent. It may be noted that Dyno
accepts
that the endorsed policy is in terms which satisfy the PJV's obligation to
effect the cl 15.2 insurance.
<P>

355  	As to the betterment claim: there is a further discrepancy in
the amount said to be in issue as identified in the submissions
of the PJV and
of Dyno. However, I understand the parties to have reached agreement as to
quantum and assume that the figure of US$1,154,798
is the agreed figure. The
parties should correct that position before entry of judgment if my
understanding is incorrect.
<P>

356  	The betterment claim arose out of the construction of a new
explosives facility in a relocated area of the site described
as being "on the
side of Mount Waruwari"and to standards required by the Mines Department which
involved additional facilities, in
particular, fire suppression and lightning
protection systems and a raw material store. I think the evidence is clear that
the relocation
was at the behest of the Mines Department and I do not
understand there to be any issue that the standards of construction were those
required by the Mines Department. So much I think is the effect of the evidence
of Alan Carpenter (Carpenter) who was the contracts
and insurance administrator
for the PJV. The real issue between the parties arises out of the contention of
Dyno that the relocation
would have been forced upon the PJV, probably within a
year of the explosions. It was submitted that any damages should be limited
to
one of the following bases:
<P>

"(a) the opportunity cost of incurring the expense in 1994/1995 rather than at
some later 
<P>

stage; 
<P>

(b) a percentage reduction giving effect to the prospect that the cost would
have been 
<P>

incurred in any event at some future stage;
<P>

(c) a general discount be applied for the benefits to the Plant and the Mine
arising from 
<P>

the enhancements."
<P>

357  	The circumstance which may have given rise to a relocation of
the explosives facility consisted in the possible encroachment
of the open pit
operation to a point where its proximity to the explosives facilities posed a
safety issue. The strongest evidence
in support of that position was that of
Twaddle whose evidence was to the effect that from the outset of the Dyno
operation "the
PJV was in the process of finding an alternative site [for the
explosives facility]. It would have been necessary to move the facility
by
about mid 1995, even if the explosion of the 2nd August 1994 had not occurred.
This was due to the expansion and growth of the
open-cut mine." (Ex D1 - 40)
<P>

358  	It was his evidence that the likely move would have been to the
location where Placer relocated the facility after the explosions.
Hood's
evidence was less dogmatic on this subject and was in the following terms:
<P>

"24. The site of the original Dyno facility has always been, and is still
today, located outside the 'blast guard position' which
is the 500 metre safety
zone around the open pit. Annexed and marked "M" and "N" are two maps of the
Porgera mine site showing the
location of the Dyno facility relative to the
safety zone. I am not aware of any fly rock ever having landed in close
proximity to
the site of the original Dyno plant as at May 1998. As at August
1994 I was not concerned about fly rock presenting a danger around
the Dyno
plant. Nor was I aware of any other safety concern existing which dictated that
the Dyno facility had to be moved, in 1995
or in the immediate future.
<P>

25. I recall that the new Dyno facility was sometimes referred to as
'temporary' in its Phase 1 position pending formal approval
of its location by
the PNG Department of Mines. However it became the permanent location. 
<P>

26. I recall that at some time during 1994 I considered the issue of moving the
Dyno facility to the general location of the SDC
dump site. This suggestion did
not progress any further. I never did a costing or sought Joint Venture
Committee approval for the
proposal, nor do I recall discussing this
possibility with any person from Dyno.
<P>

27. The Dyno plant was relocated to the Starter Dump C ("SDC") dump site as a
result of the explosions. The Department of Mines
required that the Dyno plant
be relocated after the explosions. We had to use the SDC dump site because it
was the only suitable
flat area which was close to the open pit and relatively
stable.
<P>

28. There existed no Phase 2 design which dictated that the Dyno facility would
be moved anywhere else."
<P>

(Exhibit G)
<P>

359  	The location maps evidenced by Hood show the safety zones in
relation to the open pit excavation as at the end of August 1994
and as at the
end of October 1997: in the latter case where the open pit had reached stage 3.
The old location of the explosives
facility appears to be well clear of the
"blast guard position", a situation which Hood noted was still the case as at
the date of
his statement of evidence of 8 July 1998. It was his evidence that
there had been no reported incident of fly rock landing in proximity
to the
site of the old explosives facility. 
<P>

360  	I think it is a safe conclusion from Hood's evidence that it
was not within the foreseeable program of the mining operation
and relocation
of the explosives facility on safety grounds would have been required. Garson
was cross-examined on this subject.
I think the effect of that evidence lends
further support to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence of Hood.
Garson's evidence
was as follows:
<P>

"MR FORSTER: Q. During the period 1993/1994 were you contemplating that the 
<P>

Porgera plant would need to be moved from where it was then sited?
<P>

A. No, sir.
<P>

Q. Were you aware of any suggestion that the mine move - that the mine might
move 
<P>

closer to the plant requiring its relocation?
<P>

A. Yes, sir.
<P>

Q. Was it anticipated that it would happen in the next year or so?
<P>

A. It was a revolving target, sir. I don't have a specific date.
<P>

Q. Was there an expectation, at least on your part, that it would be very
likely that the 
<P>

plant would have to move? 
<P>

A. Sir, things change in mines all the time. I had no idea whether or not 100
per cent of 
<P>

that site would be moved or not.
<P>

Q. I am not asking for a 100 per cent assurance. I was merely asking for your
belief as 
<P>

to whether you anticipated it was likely to happen?
<P>

A. It could have happened, sir, and it could not have happened. That wasn't in
my 
<P>

control. He mentioned that it possibly could move.
<P>

Q. Did you give any thought to what would be involved, so far as Dyno was
concerned, 
<P>

in moving the site?
<P>

A. No, sir.
<P>

Q. Did you give some thought as to whether a new plant would be required to be

<P>

shipped to Porgera for that purpose?
<P>

A. I didn't give it any thought, sir.
<P>

Q. But you were the Operations Manager International, were you not?
<P>

A. Sir, mines change their plans on numerous times before they have a final
plan. Even when a final plan comes about it changes.
So I didn't make any
attempts to do any design change or make any modifications or do anything for
additional plants because I didn't
have anything to say when or what the time
line was to move the plant.
<P>

Q. Being a person with significant responsibilities, do you tell the court that
you did not 
<P>

even give any thought to how such a move might be accomplished?
<P>

A. I didn't give it any serious thought, let's put it that way.
<P>

Q. Was it your usual practice to give matters that might or might not happen -
I 
<P>

withdraw that. In your view it was certainly more than a vague possibility that
it 
<P>

may be necessary to move the plant; would you agree with that?
<P>

A. It was a vague possibility that we may have to move the plant.
<P>

Q. I suggest it was more than a vague possibility?
<P>

A. No, sir."
<P>

(T633.18-T634.29)
<P>

361  	I am of the view that it would be unjustified to place any
value on what was seen as a vague possibility of relocation in
August 1994,
particularly where, in the events that have occurred, no such change would have
been dictated by the expansion of the
open pit operation. For those reasons I
think the PJV is entitled to the betterment claim as one caused by the
explosion and as imposed
upon the PJV by the requirements of the Mines
Department. I do not think it is a case where some offset for intangible
benefits should
be brought to account.
<P>

362  	The issues raised concerning the currency in which any judgment
should be expressed, the rate of interest to be applied to
any such judgment,
and the allowance for overheads, in the material damage claim are dealt with
later in these reasons save for the
6% overheads claim. 
<P>

363  	The circumstances giving rise to this claim are such that if a
basis may be legitimately found for its rejection that opportunity
should not
be lost. In making that observation I am satisfied that the PJV's overheads are
at 16% as examined later in these reasons.
The claim comes about as a result of
the acceptance by the PJV of a rate of 10% in dealing with Niugini Insurance's
assessors in
resolving the sec 1 claim under the endorsed policy. It would not
be reasonable to treat that acceptance as an admission by the PJV
of what
constituted a reasonable rate for overheads. It was a compromise arrangement.
However, having regard to a) the obligation
of the PJV to effect the cl 15.2
insurance, b) the waiver of the subrogation clause in the endorsed policy, I
think the allowance
of the 6% overheads claim would lead to injustice as
against Dyno and Niugini Insurance. 
<P>

364  	I regard the bringing of the 6% overheads claim as one
precluded by the provision of cl 15.2 of the Dyno contract. In my view
it would
lead to no different result if the PJV declined to make a legitimate claim
under the endorsed policy for no valid commercial
or legal reasons. The PJV
could not be heard to say that, nevertheless, it is entitled to look to Dyno
for recovery of such a claim.
Whether that flows from a construction of cl 15.2
or from the importation of an implied term in the Dyno contract to give
efficacy
to cl 15.2 is a matter of small moment, in my view. 
<P>

365  	It is a claim which, on the evidence of the PJV would have been
validly recovered under sec 1 of the endorsed policy. In my
view it should have
been pursued, given the PJV's insurance obligations under the Dyno contract.
Its failure to do so may not be
used as a basis for seeking recovery of it
against Dyno. Clearly the efficacy of the cl 15.2 insurance obligation is only
as good
as the PJV's enforcement of its rights under that insurance. Its
failure to do so may be regarded as a breach of its implied obligation
to do
all things necessary to give effect to such an insurance, including the making
of disclosures, claims and the like in accordance
with the requirements of the
subject policy. Alternatively the PJV's failure to press its overheads
entitlement against Niugini Insurance
may be regarded as a novus actus
interveniens.
<P>

366  	There were surprisingly few facts in issue in the
quantification of the PJV's business interruption claim. It was the
interpretation
of those facts by the experts respectively retained by the
parties in which dissent prospered and philosophies in approach were markedly
different. The evidence of Peter George Hazelwood Weldon (Weldon) was the
centrepiece of the PJV case. He is a principal of Lindquist
Avey Macdonald
Baskerville Company (referred to in various reports as "LAMB"), a company of
"Forensic &amp; Investigative Accountants".
He possessed formal qualifications
as an engineer and as a chartered accountant. His expertise lay in the
assessment of business
losses, with particular emphasis on mining enterprises
conducted in various parts of the world. He has considerable experience in
the
assessment of losses sustained by gold mining ventures in North America,
Australia and Asia. His evidence was a model of expert
analysis and
presentation. It has formed the basis of my assessment of the PJV's loss. His
evidence was attacked in submissions on
behalf of the defendants for its lack
of impartiality and for its selective use of figures to suit the case of the
PJV. He left me
in no doubt that he had thoroughly examined the available
material and had presented it as favourably for the PJV as professional
integrity permitted. I saw no vice in that and considered that the PJV was
entitled to just such an analysis without visiting any
unfairness on the
defendants. That is not to say that I found no virtue in the expert evidence
adduced in the defendants' cases as
appears from the reasons that follow.
<P>

367  	Niugini Insurance posed in its submissions what it described as
a "fundamental problem" in Weldon's evidence in that it "begs
a fundamental
question: was there any loss at all?" Elaborating upon that conundrum, it was
submitted that the "evidence adduced
[could] not satisfy the court that any
member of the PJV other than Placer [had] suffered financial loss as a result
of any loss
of or interruption to production" of the mine. Dyno supported that
position. There was no direct evidence of the marketing practices
of each of
the members of the PJV nor was there any real attempt by the defendants to
prove any of the practices save for some cross-examination.
<P>

368  	Andrew John Paton (Paton), the treasurer of Placer Pacific
Limited, gave evidence of the general way in which the precious
metals produced
by this project were marketed as follows:
<P>

"1. The last stage of production at the mine consists of 25 kg Dore bars
comprising approximately 90% gold and 8% silver.
<P>

2. The bars are shipped to refiners with whom the PJV has refining
agreements.
<P>

3. Upon receipt of refining agreements the bars the refiners credit
provisionally, in 
<P>

ounces, the respective joint ventures share of the gold and silver represented
by the 
<P>

shipment; with a final settlement after refining.
<P>

4. The joint venturers sell the gold and silver standing to their accounts, the
sales 
<P>

taking place in United States currency. Each joint venture maintains a United
States 
<P>

currency revenue account into which the proceeds of sale are credited. The
timing 
<P>

and terms of the sale are matters for each of the joint venturers."
<P>

369  	In cross-examination Paton agreed that mining houses do engage
in forward selling and related hedging practices and that he
could only
comment, in that respect, from Placer's point of view. However, he gave
evidence of a general marketing practice of the
joint venturers as follows:
<P>

"[MR DOUGLAS:] Q. In paragraph 11 you say:
<P>

The business interruption losses arising out of the explosions on 2 August 1994
are loses which flow from a disruption of a US dollar
revenue stream from the
sale of gold and silver produced at the Porgera Mine.
<P>

...There is an assumption - would you agree with me that there is an assumption
underlying that question that once the refiner has
given each of the joint
venture partners its credit in ounces for its share in gold and silver to its
metals account that that gold
and silver is immediately sold.
<P>

A. Is immediately sold? There is that assumption. I am basing that on what
would be normal practice and what I understand the partners
would be doing
individually.
<P>

...
<P>

Q. You refer in that sentence in paragraph 11 to the US dollar revenue stream;
do you 
<P>

see that?
<P>

A. Yes, I do. All I am trying to say there is that, again, it is normal
practice, and my 
<P>

understanding is that all the partners were physically selling their gold for
US dollar proceeds. 
<P>

...
<P>

Q. MR DOUGLAS: Q. Assuming a delay of 6.8 days in the milling of ore at the
mine, you would not wish to suggest that that in turn
would lead to a 6.8 day
delay in the sale of credited gold and silver and the receipt of US dollars for
that sale?
<P>

A. I guess my statement is merely pointing out that if there is a disruption to
production then obviously there would be a delay
in making a physical sale
because you can only sell physically once that production is received by each
partner. So if the delay
was 6.8 days, then there would be a delay in receiving
that production, and therefore a delay in making the sale.
<P>

Q. If the strategy of the individual joint venture partner was to retain the
physical gold, that conclusion would not follow?
<P>

A. Well, if you had a strategy of holding onto gold, then the delay would be
irrelevant.
<P>

Q. Secondly, if in fact the gold had already been sold forward in the way in
which we discussed earlier in your evidence, that delay
would also be
irrelevant.
<P>

A. In terms of selling forward you would still make any gain, or suffer any
loss of those hedge contracts which would need to be
closed out, but the
underlying physical production would still be subject to that delay.
<P>

Q. But in relation to --
<P>

A. You would be able to - I am sorry?
<P>

Q. I interrupted you. You complete your answer. 
<P>

A. I was just going to reiterate that in terms of the forward sale you could
still settle or close out that contract by buying gold
physically on the
market, so the gain or loss, whichever way your particular forward sale worked
out, would still be enjoyed or suffered
by the partner, but it would still have
missed out or been delayed in terms of the physical underlying sale."
<P>

(T409.10-T409.18...T409.25-T409.35... T409.51-58...T410.16-58)
<P>

370  	I think it is sufficient to say that conjecture and hypothesis
are no answer to legitimate overwhelming inferences that the
PJV members would
have marketed their gold entitlement as expeditiously as practicable in order
to generate the most favourable cash
flow for their respective business
enterprises. Whether any of those members engaged in forward selling, or
hedging, one does not
know, I would add, nor want to know - the calculation of
loss, as it was evaluated by the experts was complicated enough. I think
one
may safely approach the quantification of business interruption loss in
accordance with the general marketing practice evidenced
by Paton.
<P>

371  	The estimation of business interruption loss falls into two
stages:
<P>

1) an estimate of lost throughput and production of the mill and an estimate of
lost production from underground and open pit mining
which required an
evaluation of the likely grade of ore either mined or milled: 
<P>

2) an estimate of loss to the PJV that flowed from that lost production. The
loss could not be equated with the August 1994 value
of that lost production.
The loss was more in the nature of one flowing from a delayed production and
cash flow. In the case of the
underground mining the delayed production was
traced through the years of underground mining that followed the explosions up
to the
closure of the underground mining operation in December 1997. That
involved transposing the effect of lost production from month
to month under
actual prevailing conditions of planned and unplanned shutdowns or
interruptions and variations in grade encountered.
It was at that point of
underground mine closure that the loss represented by the delay in underground
production was crystallised.

<P>

372  	In the case of the lost open pit production, it was treated as
irrevocably lost. The justification for this was a pragmatic
one. Whereas the
underground mining operation was a finite one at the time of hearing, the open
pit operation was continuing and
had an indeterminate expiry date. Accordingly,
the method of evaluating the loss represented by the interruption to
underground mining
was not available to the experts. 
<P>

373  	The two stage process involved the following:
<P>

1. an estimate of the lost throughput of the mill. This required recourse to
operating records of the mill and invited a selection
of a representative
period of mill operation. This was a matter of opinion. 
<P>

2. an estimate of the lost production of the mill. This involved a
determination of the likely feed characteristics; in particular
the source and
grade of feed ore. The estimate of a representative grade of ore based on the
PJV's records called for the exercise
of expert judgment of what records were
representative. Opinions differed.
<P>

3. lost production from underground and open pit mining. This had to be
calculated from the mine records and required the selection
of a representative
period based upon expert evaluation of the mine's operation to determine a rate
of production and likely grade
of ore. Experts were in disagreement as to the
records which were representative of the period of lost production.
<P>

374  	The rationale in the methodology of Weldon is, I think,
compelling, and fully supported by the evidence of Hood. It proceeded,
in the
case of underground and open pit production, on the basis that the extraction
of the higher grade ore was given priority in
mine planning and that there was
no practicable scope for increased production to overcome the shortfall
occasioned by the August
1994 lost production. I have some doubt about the
validity of the latter proposition in relation to the open-pit operation where
there are less physical constraints which would limit an increase in resources
of workforce and equipment aimed at making up for
the shortfall. I do not doubt
the validity of the approach in relation to the underground mining. 
<P>

375  	The evidence of Hood was unequivocal to the effect that the
underground mine operated to full capacity and with resources
of workface and
equipment which would not be effectively increased to make up for the lost
production. This, I think, is notoriously
the consequence of the extremely
limited workforce and access associated with underground mining. 
<P>

376  	In any event I think one would start with the premise that any
abnormal increase in resources, prima facie, would be for the
benefit of the
party injured by the tortious conduct giving rise to the loss. Subject to
considerations of mitigation of loss, the
injured party is under no duty to
confer benefits on the wrongdoer by passing over the fruits of abnormally
increased commitments
of resources. By contrast, where the operation is
performing, for example, at undercapacity and where it would be reasonable to
utilise
that unused production capacity, then, prima facie, the injured party
would be expected to overcome the loss suffered at the hands
of the wrongdoer
by taking advantage of under-utilised capacity. That was not the case of the
underground mining and I am satisfied
that it operated at full economic
capacity save for the inevitable inefficiencies associated with all areas of
human endeavour.
<P>

377  	Hence, the methodology adopted by Weldon, if not the only
reliable approach, was one which, in my view, was clearly capable
of producing
a highly reliable estimate of loss and one which should be adopted. 
<P>

378  	In evaluating the evidence of Weldon and that of the experts
called in the cases of the defendants, I think it is necessary
to keep in mind
that their calculations, while having demonstrable, accurate, mathematical
veracity, are no more than the product
of an expression of opinions upon which
different minds may legitimately differ and, as such, as best estimates,
albeit, mathematically
derived. 
<P>

379  	The essential judicial exercise is to divine where reliability
lies in the approaches adopted by the various experts. In this
case that task
has presented me with fewer difficulties that one might expect as a result of
the highly favourable view I have formed
both of Weldon and his work which, in
substance, was fully supported by the PJV witnesses of fact. 
<P>

380  	Weldon estimated the lost mill throughput as a result of the
explosions to be 48,232 tonnes based on the agreed period of
shut down of 4.8
days: in my view a remarkably short time having regard to the devastation, loss
of life, and havoc occasioned by
the explosions. The task of marshalling fit
and available members of the taskforce and required equipment, alone, would
have been
no easy matter. The effect of the explosions on those people can only
be imagined - that goes for both staff and labour. That shortness
of mill down
time, is itself, a factor that should not be lost sight of in measuring lost
production. If it demonstrated nothing
else, it showed a highly commendable
effort on the part of the PJV to get back into stride as quickly as practicable
when time was
likely to be accruing to the account of Dyno and Niugini
Insurance. 
<P>

381  	Weldon's estimate was based upon mill throughput figures
fourteen days either side of the explosions. For this he has been
criticised by
the defendants' experts. One of the principal criticisms, is the apparently
inconsistent databases that Weldon adopted
for his various analyses. I think it
is a useful introduction to the competing contentions of the experts to
identify those apparent
inconsistencies and to examine the reliability of
Weldon's approach in the light of the evidence of the defendants' experts. That
part of the defendants case was led by the following: Murray Leslie Rowley
(Rowley) a chartered accountant and loss assessor with
GAB Robins Australia Pty
Ltd (GAB Robins) with considerable experience, thirty years in the adjusting of
claims with an international
flavour in the "mining and downstream processing
industries." While I had reason to prefer the analysis of Weldon in most
respects,
I found Rowley to be an expert with considerable practical experience
and whose evidence was of assistance in evaluating the business
interruption
claim. Like Weldon his skill and experience extended to the ability to pitch
his evidence at a level designed to attract
the Court's attention. Gregory
Charles Kerr (Kerr) a chartered accountant and partner in the firm of Kerr
&amp; Holland, who specialised
in commercial insurance, including claims for
business interruption and material damage losses. His experience, while less
orientated
to mining operations than either Weldon or Rowley, has been
extensive. I found him to be extremely able and informed, although inclined
to
be insurer orientated in his thinking processes: Merrick Kingsbury Hall (Hall),
a mining engineer and managing director of MineConsult,
mine management
consultants. His expertise, in my assessment, consisted in the ability to carry
out computer modelling of a mining
operation. He christened his modelling
technique the "Mining Replication Schedule Process" and described it as
follows:
<P>

"10.2.1 A Mining Replication Schedule involves the following tasks:
<P>

a) defining an accurate picture of the open cut mine, underground mine, 
<P>

stockpile, mill and any other key areas just prior to the Incident
<P>

b) collecting site data on all aspects that would have influence the mining
<P>

operation in August 1994 and surrounding months. This includes, but is by no
means limited to:
<P>

i) geological model sections and plans
<P>

ii) geotechnical data on each rock type
<P>

iii) drill stock reserves by the various ore and waste categories
<P>

iv) blast stock reserves by the various ore and waste categories
<P>

v) historical performance of all major and support equipment
<P>

vi) detailed stage plans of open cut and underground operations
<P>

vii) predicted excavator productivity per ore category
<P>

viii) haul route profiles per ore category and waste
<P>

xi) haul route characteristics such as rolling resistance, behaviour when
wet
<P>

x) equipment performance parameters such as bucket fill factors and pass
configuration, truck queuing, truck presentation
<P>

xi) waste dump stope schedules
<P>

xiii) underground stope schedules
<P>

xiv) ground support requirements
<P>

xv) detailed milling rates per ore type
<P>

xvi) mill performance parameters, eg, gold recovery
<P>

xvii) stockpile layout plans
<P>

xviii) climate conditions
<P>

...
<P>

c) Calibrating scheduling parameters by creating a detailed schedule of events
prior to the Incident and comparing it to actual
results to calibrate all
parameters to reflect the Porgera operation.
<P>

d) Preparing the detailed Mining Replication Schedule, including a detailed
examination of material movements from the open cut
and underground mines for
August 1994 and surrounding months assuming the Incident had not taken place.
The material is also scheduled
through the mill to determine gold production
and revenues.
<P>

e) Comparing the Mining Replication Schedule with actual mine performance to
assess the impact of the Incident."
<P>

(Exhibit D1-43)
<P>

382  	It was his recommendation that such a model should have been
prepared on the basis of the following reasoning:
<P>

"10.1.3 MineConsult recommends the preparation of a Mining Replication Schedule
to accurately determine performance of the open
cut, underground, stockpiles
and mill and the various interfaces thereof."
<P>

His report concluded with the following:
<P>

"10.2.2 Notwithstanding the recommendation for a Mining replication Schedule
MineConsult considers it appropriate to note the following
negative aspects of
undertaking the Mining Replication Schedule in 1999:
<P>

a) current availability of detailed, relevant data, plans and schedules
<P>

b) access to personnel with detailed knowledge and recollection of
circumstances surrounding the Incident
<P>

c) relatively high cost of such a study
<P>

10.2.3 In other words, the Mining Replication Schedule should have been
contemplated by the PJV immediately following the Incident
in order to properly
assess and quantify any claims that might have been due."
<P>

383  	The practical experience of Hall was evidenced as follows:
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN:] Q. Now, you said yesterday that you have got no experience of
any significance in mining in Papua New Guinea; that
was correct, wasn't it?
<P>

A. Yes, that is correct.
<P>

Q. You have never been to Porgera?
<P>

A. No.
<P>

Q. Your career in mining engineering has been in consulting, hasn't it?
<P>

A. Largely.
<P>

Q. Well, yesterday, I think you said that before you were at MineConsult you
were with a consulting firm in Brisbane; is that right?
<P>

A. I was based in Sydney but the consulting firm was headed out of Brisbane;
that is correct."
<P>

(T1385.7-1385.23)
<P>

384  	In the absence of MineConsult's Mining Replication Schedule I
found very little assistance in Hall's opinion evidence which,
in my view,
foundered on the bar of impracticality. An illustration may suffice. He
expressed an opinion that the explosions could
have resulted in an improvement
in mine production for reasons that he stated as follows:
<P>

"Q. Could you also then give us your opinion on the effect which a catastrophe
such as 
<P>

this would in a general way have on production on a mine such as Porgera?
<P>

A. It is difficult to be specific because this is obviously quite a unique
occurrence, and fortunately I can say I have not been
involved in a similar
situation. What is quite normal in lessor catastrophes, where, for example, a
man may be killed or something
like this, it is not unusual for the workforce
to in fact go back to work with increased vigour, if you like for two
reasons.
<P>

One is, I think, they are vary conscious that there has been some lost
production, but quite often also they go back to work the
next shift, in
effect, and contribute that shift's pay to the widow or the affected families.

<P>

I believe it is difficult now, years after the event, to predict what would
have happened, but I believe that there was scope that
people may have put a
bit more effort in.
<P>

Q. But also it could have had an effect upon it, are you not discounting
that?
<P>

A. Oh, no, not at all. I appreciate there was a catastrophe there and I am
sympathetic 
<P>

to that and the effect on the whole mine, yes.
<P>

HIS HONOUR: Q. Those observations that you have just made in terms of
contributions to the relatives, and renewed desire for increased
production,
does that apply to the indigenous work force in Papua New Guinea?
<P>

A. I can't comment on that, your Honour.
<P>

Q. I suspect it doesn't.
<P>

A. Possibly correct.
<P>

Q. You made a comment, I made some observations, but I have some very, very
significant difficulties in equating this interruption
with an unscheduled
interruption to a project where you have several people killed in horrendous
circumstances, and in a circumstance
that I would have expected would have
undermined the morale of people who had to work with explosives. So much so
that we are being
told that people left the site, didn't want to work on it any
further. So it seems to me that any realistic appraisal of the loss
has to face
up to the reality of the devastated site and I think involving some little time
to get back into gear. Do you have any
comment on that?
<P>

A. I would agree with you. I would agree with you on the aspect of there would
be a significant effect on the operations.
<P>

Q. Are you aware that they were collecting body pieces from all over the
site?
<P>

A. Yes, I was aware.
<P>

Q. In days to follow?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. It just seems to me to be running in the face of reality to think that
people put on their helmets and picked up their picks
and started digging
vigorously?
<P>

A. Yes. I believe that the comments in the MineConsult report, that we are not
promoting that there was no effect on production
or no loss of production. I
suppose the main drift of our comments was along the lines of commenting on a
more reasonable estimate
of the projection. We tended not to delve into the
detail day-to-day effect, if you like. Perhaps my comment previous to you
interceding
was implying at Porgera that they may have got back to work the
next shift or so. I suppose I was talking in general terms. But,
notwithstanding that, it is rather site specific, and your comment on the
indigenous peoples I am sure is correct. 
<P>

But I think that at another site it may well have been that some of the
expatriates, or the Australians, may have got back into
work faster than other
places. I can't comment. I don't believe that's affected our estimate of a
reasonable projection."
<P>

(T 1361.17-1362.49)
<P>

385  	As may appear from that transcript I was unimpressed with that
expression of opinion. I was no more impressed with Hall's
opinion evidence
that the lost underground mining production could have been overcome by the PJV
within two years of the explosions.
He gave evidence of the PJV's capacity for
"catch-up" as follows:
<P>

"MR DOUGLAS: Q. There has been considerable evidence also in relation to the

<P>

possibility of catching up underground production as prior to December 1997,
when the mine was exhausted as compared to open pit
production. I wonder if you
could just tell us - give us your opinion as to the differences which exist
between underground and open
pit production in that regard, and the ability to
catch up underground production on a site such as Porgera?
<P>

A. Yes. If I may firstly just briefly pick up a little bit more on the open
cut. There is 
<P>

one difference perhaps with the underground that is particularly relevant to
the open cut on the possibility of catch-up or make-up,
is that we have heard
various bits of evidence about the Porgera Mine operating 365 days a year, 24
hours a day with a set fleet
of mining plant, if you like, and there was
absolutely no possibility of make-up.
<P>

In theory, I can abide by that. In practice, I have some problems, because the
truck fleet, it is my understanding, and I could
be corrected on this, but the
truck fleet at Porgera typically runs at 75 to 80 per cent availability, which
is once again, I believe,
it is an all up utilisation factor which is of 365
days times 24 hours a day less lunch breaks. You have 75 to 80 per cent of that
time when the truck is available to do useful work.
<P>

Similarly with the excavators, about 80 to 85 per cent. If we are talking about
19,000 tonnes of high grade ore catch-up, and Mr
Douglas established with Mr
Hood that that related to about 10 hours of an excavator productivity, one way
that I see that we can
catch up is that on the routine scheduled service
breaks, if you like, of the excavator, which is 250, 500, 1,000 type service
breaks
where you might put in 40 man-hours on one of these excavators. Then one
area I can see potential is that you could pay some of your
maintenance
personnel overtime and maybe you could complete that regular 1,000 hour service
in 30 hours rather than 40 hours. Suddenly
you have picked up 10 hours.
<P>

So I believe that there are opportunities for catch-up in the open cut albeit
the mine is running pretty flat out, and I understand
Mr Weldon's comment if it
is working 365 days a year it is not easy to bring in new equipment or
whatever.
<P>

In relation to the underground, I think obviously not being privy and having
close knowledge of the underground at Porgera, it is
difficult to be
definitive. The reason we plotted those graphs for underground production and
underground development, which were
previously MFI 7, I didn't catch the new
name.
<P>

Q. Exhibit D1-48.
<P>

A. That Exhibit D1-48 consists of two graphs, your Honour. One a measure of 
<P>

underground development reported at metres of development on a month-by- month
basis out to June '97. The other one reporting underground
ore mined reported
in tonnage from December 1992 to June 1997. The reason we did not take that
graph out to December 1997 is we didn't
have consistent adequate data.
<P>

My interpretation of particularly the graph representing underground ore mined
is that somewhere in there I would have thought it
is not unreasonable that
there would have been an opportunity during that downward trend in production,
particularly from mid 1995
through to the end of the graph in mid-1997, that
there may have been an opportunity to recoup some of the purported losses in
August
1994 because, and unfortunately we did not have data on stope schedules
and production schedules for the underground, but I did have
access to a stope
schedule for 1995, and it would appear that during that period there was still
a large number of stopes in activity
with tonnage available at a very large
range of grades, from 6 grams a tonne I think up to 40 grams a tonne, in that
order.
<P>

It wasn't a case of only operating one stope or two stopes. So without being
definitive that me, as an outsider, not visiting the
site and being there at
the same time, saying "you definitively should have been able to catch-up" I
thought it was a reasonable
assumption, in two years, particularly with the
downward trend and the underground ore mined, there would have been scope to
catch-up."
<P>

(T1363.54-1365.37)
<P>

386  	I regard that analysis to be contrary to the evidence of Hood
and in the nature of hypothesis that was untried and unproven.

<P>

387  	In relation to lost mill throughput Hall adopted a figure of
36,557 tonnes. This was calculated from a 'trend line' of mill
production from
January 1993 to December 1995. I regard that selection to be a seriously
distorted basis of evaluation of actual
lost production in August 1994.
Clearly, in my view, for that exercise, one has to look at the immediately
surrounding level of production,
take into account such matters as planned shut
downs and, perhaps, make an allowance for vicissitudes.
<P>

388  	Rowley's approach was more acceptable in that he limited the
source data to the production for the calendar year in one exercise
and, in an
alternative approach, used the period of four months preceding and following
August. The first exercise yielded a calculation
of lost throughput of 36,232
tonnes and, the second, a figure of 34,860 tonnes.
<P>

389  	Although the selection of source records for the calculation of
lost mill throughput involves a question of degree, Rowley's
calculation of
lost throughput suffers from distortions as, I think, was revealed in his
cross-examination as follows:
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN:] Q. Can I ask you to turn to page 12. I am focusing now on the
first paragraph on page 12. One of the key integers
in your estimate of
shortfall tonnage of 36,000-odd tonnes was an estimate of average daily
throughput of 8,760 tonnes; is that correct?
<P>

A. Correct.
<P>

Q. And that is fundamental to calculating lost mill throughput of 36,232
tonnes?
<P>

A. Correct.
<P>

Q. I want you to take the figure of 8,760 tonnes per day and apply it to the
4.83 days of actual shutdown of the mill. That, I suggest
to you, would lead to
a loss of 42,310 tonnes in the shutdown period.
<P>

A. Correct.
<P>

Q. That is 6,078 tonnes higher than your estimated loss of 36,232 tonnes?
<P>

A. Yes, it is.
<P>

Q. That shows, doesn't it, that you regard there as having been a - I withdraw
that. Implicit in that analysis is the proposition
that there was a catch-up of
lost production of 6,078 tonnes in the remainder of August after the mill
resumed operation?
<P>

A. Yes. My methodology works on the basis that I look at the whole of the
August period not just the 4.8 days.
<P>

Q. Yes, but it is implicit in your conclusion, isn't it, that there was a
catch-up of lost production of 6,078 tonnes in the remainder
of August after
the mill resumed operation?
<P>

A. That is what the figures show."
<P>

(T1477.52-1478.31)
<P>

390  	The justification for this apparent anomaly of improved
post-explosions throughput was expressed in Rowley's evidence-in-chief
as
follows:
<P>

"13. Our experience is that quite often immediately after resuming from a
stoppage, 
<P>

milling rates tend to better so we are not surprised that this occurred with
PJV. This is often due to checks and minor adjustments
that are made during the
opportunity provided by the stoppage and the psychological effect on employees
that due to an earlier stoppage,
post production needs to be maximised as far
as possible. This is consistent with the post resumption benefits identified in
the
MineConsult report in their paragraph 4.2.10."
<P>

(Exhibit D2-17)
<P>

391  	Rowley's views on this matter were explored in
cross-examination as follows:
<P>

"Q. You accept, don't you, tonnes not processed through the mill during
interruption can't be recouped?
<P>

A. In the short-term there are much higher levels of - and this is the nub of
this whole 
<P>

measurement consideration - you need to look at a longer term period, and 4.8
days could be totally unfair to PJV. If there's a
ramp-up requirement in the
next few days, they are not getting the normal tonnes they would have, so it is
a double-sided coin, looking
beyond the immediate shutdown period. 
<P>

Q. Your opinion as to a recoupment of this lost 6,078 tonnes, even on your
estimate, in 
<P>

the balance of August is based on the assumption, is it, that the mill ran more
efficiently than normal after the interruption;
do you agree with that?
<P>

A. Well, it certainly appeared on the numbers to have run very well, yes, I
agree.
<P>

Q. It is based on the assumption the psychological effect of the explosion was
beneficial?
<P>

A. For the reasons that I've stated there were improvements achieved.
<P>

Q. And if those assumptions are wrong, then it would follow, wouldn't it, that
your 
<P>

method of calculating lost mill throughput has underestimated the lost mill
throughput by 6,078 tonnes; do you agree?
<P>

A. Not necessarily.
<P>

Q. Well, why do you say that?
<P>

A. Because I am looking at a long-term average in terms of the base, and I've
always 
<P>

accepted the fact that the numbers appeared to be higher immediately after. But
most claims that I am involved with, that is a fairly
usual phenomena.
<P>

Q. You have thought of number of a different ways of calculating this. I think
the latest version, correct me if I am wrong, is
on the question of lost mill
throughput is that contained in D2-18, entitled "Comments on determination of a
fair base or yardstick
for comparing with the actual achievement within the
disrupted period"?
<P>

A. It is.
<P>

Q. In that document you no longer have an average daily mill throughput of
8,760, what you have is an average of 8,716; is that
right?
<P>

A. That is the way the numbers calculate.
<P>

Q. If you multiply 8,716 by 4.83 you get 42,098 tonnes?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Take away what you - you now say, don't you, there was lost mill throughput
of 34,860 tonnes, don't you.
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Leading to a balance of a difference of 7,238 tonnes?
<P>

A. I accept your maths.
<P>

Q. And implicit in that calculation is the assumption, isn't it, 7,238 tonnes
of lost production during the period of interruption
must have been caught up
in the remainder of August after the mill resumed operation; correct?
<P>

A. The same argument applies as to the earlier figure.
<P>

Q. If the assumptions to which you earlier referred as to the mill operating
more efficiently and the psychological effect being
beneficial aren't valid,
then you have underestimated the lost mill throughput by that method, haven't
you?
<P>

A. In your words."
<P>

(T1481.17-1482.40)
<P>

392  	I have earlier expressed my view about the applicability of
those considerations to the magnitude of the devastation and on-going
restoration and clean-up that was associated with the explosions and their
aftermath.
<P>

393  	In relation to lost underground production of ore as a result
of the explosions Weldon estimated that 29,177 tonnes had been
lost and not
made up until closure of the underground operation. For this calculation,
Weldon used as source material the underground
operation records for the two
months preceding and following the closure caused by the explosions. Rowley
used the records from the
1994 calendar year. Hall's calculation I think may be
disregarded. Rowley's calculation of 4,204 tonnes of lost production per day
may be compared with Weldon's 4,292 tonnes per day. Rowley's calculation
resulted in a total loss of production in August 1994 of
20,929 tonnes while
Weldon estimated that 29,177 tonnes had been lost. 
<P>

394  	As in Rowley's approach to the estimate of lost mill
throughput, this calculation of lost ore production has the corollary
that, in
the second half of August there was, in effect, a recovery of lost production
of several thousand tonnes. That result was
explored in the following
cross-examination of Rowley: 
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN:] Q. All right. Do you accept that if underground production could
not be caught up between 15 and 31 August to the
tune of 7,127 tonnes, then you
have underestimated the tonnage of ore from the underground mine that was lost
in August?
<P>

A. I don't believe I've underestimated, because I have applied a reasonable
average over a large number of months in obtaining a
standard, and then taking
away the actual for the full month of August. If that, by your calculations,
presents a $7,000 catch-up
in your terms, I have no problem with that.
<P>

Q. And you have no problem with that. But it depends, doesn't it, upon the
validity of your assumption that the underground mine
was able to catch-up
7,127 tonnes between 15 and 31 August, doesn't it?
<P>

A. That is how the numbers have fallen out of the figures.
<P>

Q. You agree with me, I think?
<P>

A. Subject to the limitation that I just expressed.
<P>

Q. Yes. And do you accept Mr Hood is in a far better position than you to say
whether it was possible to catch up tonnage production
in the underground mine
in any period but specifically including 15 to 31 August?
<P>

A. I have the greatest respect for Mr Hood as a mining engineer but I have to
deal with what the figures tell me, and the figures
are showing that is what
happened in the month of August. Whether it is catch-up in your terms of just
the way the tonnes rolled
through, I have no difficulty with it.
<P>

Q. Do you agree with my proposition?
<P>

A. Subject to the conditions I have made.
<P>

Q. Just to complete this, can we have a look at the new figures you have got
for lost underground production?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. They are set out in exhibit D2-18 entitled "Comments on determination of a
fair base or yardstick et cetera". And in paragraph
13 you say "Underground
mine tonnes per day"?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. 4,217?
<P>

A. Correct.
<P>

Q. If you multiply 4,217 by 12.59 you get 53,092. Do you accept that?
<P>

A. Give me the figures again.
<P>

Q. 4,217 times 12.59 days lost?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Equals 53,092 tonnes?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. If one takes away the actual production from the underground in that period
of 24,872 tonnes?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. You get lost production of 28,220 tonnes?
<P>

A. You do.
<P>

Q. You now say in attachment A, or annexure A to D2-18, that you estimate
21,283 tonnes were lost from the underground in that period?
<P>

A. I do.
<P>

Q. And you are implicitly assuming that 6, 937 tonnes were caught up in the
period 15 to 31 August; correct?
<P>

A. Those are your words. I believe that using my methodology of looking at the
whole month of August, rather than focussing on the
12.59 days, my basis is
fair and reasonable. This is a system that I use every week of my life. I run
around the world measuring
these claims and the basis - I am leaving tomorrow
to go to Kennecott Copper, in Utah, and I will be using exactly those bases.
<P>

Q. And your clients in those cases are insurers, aren't they?
<P>

A. In this case, yes, I am working for insurers. I am not always working for
insurers.
<P>

Q. Usually?
<P>

A. Usually, yes."
<P>

(T1485.25-1487.4)
<P>

395  	The reference to the D2-18 is a reference to an alternative
calculation offered by Rowley based upon records for the period
of four months
either side of August 1994. I think it is useful to state the way Rowley
offered an alternative calculation of lost
underground production of ore,
namely:
<P>

April - July (122 days) total production 481, 827 tonnes
<P>

September - December (122 days) total production 547, 227 tonnes
<P>

Daily Average (481,827 + 547,224) &#247; 244 = 4, 217 tonnes
<P>

Projection for August 31 x 4217 = 130, 740 tonnes
<P>

Actual August 109, 457 tonnes
<P>

Lost Production 21, 283 tonnes
<P>

396  	In the absence of anything more reliable, that analysis would
fall within a broad acceptable approach. I think it is pertinent
in that
context to note the principles upon which Rowley stated such an estimate should
be made, namely, as including the following:
<P>

"1. The aim is to try to establish as equitably as possible the appropriate
performance during a disrupted period if the particular
event had not taken
place.
<P>

2. With regard to plant performance it is necessary to have a sufficiently long
enough period involved to obtain a good data sample.
<P>

3. Normal accepted practice is to examine the actual performance before and
after the loss.
<P>

4. Too short a period can produce a standard which is distorted either way: too
high or too low. Short term periods can have some
real aberrations.
<P>

5. No matter how short the disruption due allowance has to be still recognised
in the benchmark for unscheduled stoppages and breakdowns.
Strikes or idle days
also need to be allowed for.
<P>

6. Planned maintenance need to be considered within the calculations. This can
be achieved by either deducting from the standard
data the period when
production was stopped or curtailed due to maintenance or alternatively by
ensuring that in the month being
reviewed there is inclusion of equivalent
maintenance days in the month or period 
<P>

being reviewed.
<P>

7. Due regard needs to made (sic) for the number of days in each calendar month
in establishing the appropriate daily rate.
<P>

...
<P>

9. The actual performance immediately after the disrupted period should be
considered as being excluded from the standard and included
in the actual for
two reasons: (a) Ramp up that has to occur before full production rates are
attained (b) Make up that can quite
often occur due to the benefit achieved
from adjustments/maintenance carried out during the shutdown."
<P>

(Exhibit D2-18)
<P>

397  	Of those observations I have expressed my views of the matters
falling within par 9. In relation to par 6, on the evidence
of Hood, that
factor called for no adjustment to the Weldon estimate. 
<P>

398  	I think Weldon's estimate was reliable in relation to the
period of recorded production to which he had recourse. I prefer
it over the
estimate of Rowley for a number of reasons, including the following:
<P>

1. In my view both calculations of Rowley suffer from a distortion created by
recourse to material, in part, too far removed from
the time of the explosions.
I have commented on that. 
<P>

2. The Weldon estimate has the additional merit of adjustment to take account
of the evidence of mine operations given, in particular,
by Hood. The
adjustment was referred to in the submissions on behalf of Niugini Insurance as
an exercise in 'massaging' the figures.
I regard the methodology as producing a
more reliable estimate. 
<P>

399  	Kerr, in a supplementary report challenged Weldon's allowance
of additional overhead costs in the extended period of underground
mining, in
December 1997, namely 6.8 days. Kerr expressed the qualification he held about
the reliability of Weldon's allowance as
follows: 
<P>

"LAMB have calculated the marginal cost of the 6.8 days additional fixed
overheads in December by assuming 6.8 days worth of "fixed"
overheads
applicable to the underground mine in the period January - December 1994. If
the assumption of underground deferral to
December 1997 is valid, I believe
that LAMB should have carefully analysed what actually happened in the closure
phase of the open
pit mine (say during the last six months to December 1997).
Such an analysis would have to demonstrate what the practical reality
was with
the way the selected fixed costs actually behaved in this closure period to
prove the validity of the significant deduction
from the underground credit of
US$418,784 caused by the additional fixed costs. The US$418,784 deduction
calculated by LAMB reduces
directly proportionately if the 6.8 days production
period is reduced"
<P>

(Exhibit D1-59)
<P>

400  	I think Weldon did pay sufficient regard to the conditions of
underground mine closure in his estimate. In any event, in the
absence of a
more reliable estimate of the overhead components of loss, I see no reason for
rejecting the Weldon analysis.
<P>

401  	Lost open pit ore production was estimated by Weldon to affect
73,880 tonnes made up of 19,055 tonnes, the result of lost
mill throughput, and
the balance of 54,825 tonnes being an estimate of the amount of stockpiled ore
from the open pit being milled
in the absence of available ore from the open
pit mining which would have been the subject of direct feed to the mill.
Implicit in
that approach was the assumption that the PJV practice in open pit
mining was to feed the higher grade ore directly to the mill and
to stockpile
the lesser grade production. This assumption was well founded in the evidence
of Hood. 
<P>

402  	Hall's comment on Weldon's methodology was expressed as
follows:
<P>

"6.1.2 The LAMB Report claims a total of 73,880 tonnes of open pit direct mill
feed ore was permanently lost to production between
the period 2 August to 22
August, 1994.
<P>

<b>6.2 Comments on LAMB Methodology</b>
<P>

6.2.1 The LAMB Report Schedule A9 details the methodology in this regard. 
<P>

MineConsult accepts there was a period of open pit shutdown resulting from the
Incident, but MineConsult does not accept that all
of the production loss
claimed by LAMB was solely in consequence of the Incident and have fundamental
problems with the approach
and assumptions adopted in the LAMB Report. Further,
the average daily production of open pit feed in the period September, 1994
to
February, 1995 is not an appropriate guide to the open pit feed production
which would have been achieved but for the Incident.

<P>

6.2.2 This approach adopted by LAMB: 
<P>

a) does not account for significant catch-up mining in September. 
<P>

Following the Incident and prior to the first blast on 22 August 1994, mining
did not cease, it merely re-focussed. This period
should have been used to
undertake a number of activities in preparation for resumption of high grade
ore mining, including:
<P>

i) ore drilling
<P>

ii) grade control sampling
<P>

iii) face clean up
<P>

iv) bench preparation and mark up
<P>

v) drill pattern surveys
<P>

vi) road maintenance
<P>

vii) waste mining 
<P>

The completion of such preparation work establishes the platform for
accelerated ore mining, as evidenced by September's ore production
tonnes being
38% higher than that of the two months immediately prior the Incident.
<P>

Also, it is MineConsult's experience that often following an interruption to
gold output, higher grade ore zones are subsequently
targeted in the mine to
make up for lost gold ounces. The use in the LAMB Report of the September, 1994
higher grade recovery rates
skews the results higher than what was likely to
have been achieved had the Incident not occurred."
<P>

(Exhibit D1-43)
<P>

403  	Hall was cross-examined on those passages as follows:
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN] Q. Go, if you would, please, to paragraph 6.2.2(a). Do you agree
that they involve matters as to the detailed day-to-day
effect of the incident
in August 1994?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. You haven't delved into the matters concerning the day-to-day incident in
August 1994, have you?
<P>

A. No.
<P>

Q. They also concern matters that are specific to the site, don't they? 
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. You haven't looked at matters specific to the site other than what you read
in the mine manager's reports; isn't that right?
<P>

A. Yes. And some additional information that was provided to us?
<P>

Q. What was that additional information?
<P>

A. I believe that was provided in the source of material document that was
handed around this morning.
<P>

Q. I see. You recognise, don't you, that Mr Hood is in a much better position
than you to say whether there was a benefit during
the incident from
undertaking the kinds of tasks which are set out in 6.2.2(a)?
<P>

A. No, I am not prepared to accept that statement.
<P>

Q. In light of your answers, these are matters concerned with detailed
day-to-day effects of the incident, and matters concerning
questions which are
specific to the site. Why is it that you don't recognise that Mr Hood is in a
far better position than you to
comment on whether those matters had a
beneficial effect on production after the incident?
<P>

A. The basis for that opinion is that I have some concern in reconciling what
is actually planned and forecast at the Porgera Mine,
in order to maximise rate
of return, as being stated as the driver at the Porgera Mine, with what
actually happens at the Porgera
Mine. And the two, as indicated I believe in
one of my graphs, do not coincide very often, and would imply that perhaps
there were
opportunities for optimising some of these areas that I refer to in
6.2.2(a). Perhaps in the optimisation of those areas, albeit
they are very site
specific areas, there could have been more focus applied in those areas.
<P>

Q. Now you have used the word "perhaps" twice in that answer. All you are doing
- is this right - all you are doing is saying, "
Here are some possibilities
which might have arisen or might not"?
<P>

A. Yes. Yes.
<P>

Q. Could the witness please be shown --
<P>

HIS HONOUR: Q. Before you leave that, does that explain - looking at paragraph
5.2.1(d), in that paragraph you express the view
that the September figures may
reflect the catch-up culture; do you see that?
<P>

A. Yes, I see that.
<P>

Q. Then in 6.2.2(a) you refer to what seems to be a fact that the Lamb approach
does not account for significant catch-up mining
in September. You seem to have
gone from a possibility to a statement of fact.
<P>

A. I am just trying to follow. In figure 5.2.1(d) I not only talk about
catch-up culture which on hearing the evidence of Mr Hood
appeared to not
necessarily be the case. I also refer to support activities undertaken in
August in preparation of subsequent ore
production. I believe I touched on that
in relation to the waste mining aspects. I am not quite following where you say
I am going
from an opinion to a fact.
<P>

Q. Expressing opinion about a possibility in 5.2.1(d) where you say that the
trend may reflect a catch-up culture and in 6.2.2(a)
you are referring to the
fact or significant catch-up mining in September.
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. It seems to be a different approach. I am wondering where you stand?
<P>

A. I suppose I would rather 6.2.2(a) to be more an opinion rather than a fact,
your Honour.
<P>

Q. Of a possibility?
<P>

A. Yes."
<P>

(T1390.13-1391.53)
<P>

404  	As with most of his report, I think Hall's evidence is more in
the nature of speculation rather than expert opinion based
upon the actual
experience of the Porgera mining operation as evidenced, principally, by
Hood.
<P>

405  	Nevertheless, the open pit production loss claim posed, in my
view, a particularly difficult quantification of loss: not so
much in relation
to the lost mill throughput of 19,055 tonnes. Rather the problem lay in
quantifying any loss associated with the
use of 54,825 tonnes of stock piled
ore. 
<P>

406  	On behalf of Niugini Insurance it was submitted that this part
of the PJV claim should be limited to the loss associated with
the 19,055
tonnes lost mill feed and that no allowance was justified for the forced use in
August of lower grade stockpile ore in
lieu of higher grade direct feed from
the open cut which was unavailable due, inter alia, to insufficiency of
explosives supply.

<P>

407  	This contention was advanced principally on two bases: 1) that
a recourse by the PJV after August 1994, to greater proportions
of direct feed
ore to open pit stockpile when compared with the proportions of that mill feed
pre August 1994, resulted in a recovery
of the gold which would have been
milled but for the forced use of open pit stockpile in August 1994: 2) that the
methodology adopted
by Weldon was erroneous and inapplicable to a situation
where there was no loss of throughput to the mill: where the loss was
represented
in the reduced grade of feed. 
<P>

408  	Weldon's process involved calculating the reduced mill
production in August associated with this lower grade open-pit stockpile-feed
and to treat that reduced gold production as 'lost' on the basis of Hood's
evidence that, in effect, a miner cannot, in practical
terms, 'cherry pick'
grades of ore to mine higher grades in the open pit: that the PJV resources and
method of operation left no
room for 'catch-up' of the lost gold and that the
open pit ore production, post August 1994 was not evidence of 'catch-up', but
of
an increased grade of ore being mined. 
<P>

409  	It was not practical to mirror the exercise carried out in
relation to lost underground ore production to calculate the loss
represented
by deferred ore recovery from the open cut. As earlier stated, the underground
operation was a finite one which ended
in December 1997 and permitted a
calculation, albeit an extremely painstaking one, of the loss associated with
the deferred underground
production: whereas, the life of the open pit was
indeterminate. It had been extended to 2016 and it is reasonable to infer that
further extensions will occur. 
<P>

410  	The short argument advanced on behalf of Niugini Insurance was
that all one was concerned with was, not a loss of mill throughput,
rather a
use of reduced grade in the mill feed. Consequently, any loss could be reduced
by increasing the proportion of direct feed
to stockpile ore from the open cut
post August 1994 to make up for the August lower grade feed. 
<P>

411  	However the approach adopted by Weldon has found acceptance in
the following North American authorities: <b>Continental Oil Co v SS Electra

<P>

412  	The view I have formed is that the approach of Weldon is to be
preferred. I have commented on Hall's approach upon which heavy
reliance was
placed by Kerr. In assessing this element of the claim, Kerr adopted as an
assumption the following:
<P>

<u>"Assumption 5:</u>
<P>

To the extent that Open Pit production was deferred in consequence of the
Incident and not other factors, the deferred Open Pit
production would have
been made up in the month of September 1994 or at least before 12 months
elapsed after the Incident.
<P>

4.2.3 Essentially our position is that the loss consequent upon an
irretrievable loss of mill throughput of 36,557 tonnes per should
be calculated
by reference to the Open Pit stockpile feed as any deferred U/G and Open Pit
direct feed would have been made up within
the two years following the
Incident. The two year period following the Incident is relevant to our
assessment because the average
monthly price of Gold per ounce was, for some 21
months of this period, above the US$380.48 used by LAMB to calculate the Item 1
claim. During this two year period the average price of Gold per ounce per
month reached a high point of US$404.76 per ounce in February
1996 and a low
point of US$376.64 in February 1995 (source LAMB Report Schedules D1.1 -
D1.7).

<u>$1,098,892"</u>
<P>

(Exhibit D1-57)
<P>

I think that assumption is fallacious and is contrary to the evidence of Hood.

<P>

413  	Rowley accepted that "there was a reduction tonnage of Open Pit
Direct feed to the mill which can never be caught up." (Exhibit
D2-16). It was
Rowley's evidence as follows: 
<P>

"10. It is normal when establishing an average head grade, to consider the long
term future average rather than past grades for
ore which has already been
processed. (Most operations use up the high grade material first to enhance
early cash flow receipts.)"
<P>

(Exhibit 2-18)
<P>

414  	On that basis Rowley used the "four months post August ...for
establishing the Open Pit Direct Feed average head grade" (Exhibit
D2-18),
which he assessed at "6.20 g/t". However Rowley distinguished between lost
grade and lost tonnage in the following way: 
<P>

"4. On the other hand, tonnage and grade are different concepts. It is our view
that it is incorrect and inequitable for no recognition
to be given for the
flow through impact of the abnormal feed allocation in August 1994 on the
subsequent months - the so called "ripple
effect" - when assessing the true
loss to the PJV.
<P>

5. In our opinion, the figures for production and processing show that PJV had
considerable flexibility in the manner in which they
sourced material for each
month's production. Furthermore, a percentage analysis of the relationship
between low grade material taken
from stockpiles compared with the Open Pit
direct for April - July 1994 confirms that there was a correlation between the
two feed
sources in relation to the total feed processed. It is our view that
such a correlation would have persisted from August to December
1994."
<P>

(Exhibit D2-19)
<P>

415  	Based upon that approach Rowley carried out the following
comparisons of proportions of open pit direct feed to stockpile
feed for the
four months pre-August and the four months post August:
<P>

"...for the four months immediately prior to August 1994...the low grade ore
from stockpiles represented <b>14.7% </b>of the total feed. In the same period
the Open Pit Direct feed represented <b>38.4%</b>...
<P>

...for the month of August...the percentage of low grade stockpile sourced ore
has increased substantially to<b> 38.4%</b>... Conversely the Open Pit Direct
ore has fallen to only <b>13.6%</b>...
<P>

...for the four post August months...the stockpiled ore [feed]...has fallen to
<b>7.0% </b>whilst...the Open Pit Direct ore...increased to <b>43.5%</b>." 
<P>

He offered the opinion that "this is not only related to, but in fact a direct
consequence of, the over-allocation of feed from
stockpiles in August 1994."
<P>

In conclusion Rowley opined that: 
<P>

"In our opinion the above statistics are not the result of coincidence or
aberration and they justify our conclusion that the only
Open pit claim gold
loss that can be considered relates to the permanent failure to mill <b>19,055
tonnes </b>of open pit ore. There is no additional los (sic) for loss of
grade."
<P>

(Exhibit D2 -19)
<P>

416  	There may have been an element of validity in Rowley's analysis
were it not for the evidence of Hood whom I regarded as a
frank witness. He was
cross-examined on Rowley's figures of open pit ore feed as follows:
<P>

"[MR McDOUGALL]...Q. In August 1994, accepting Mr Weldon's projection of what
would have gone to the mill but for the explosion,
open pit direct feed would
have contributed 36 per cent.
<P>

A. Okay.
<P>

Q. In the following month, September, open pit direct feed actually contributed
43 per cent. In October 44 per cent. In November
32 per cent. And in December
53 per cent.
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. If you accept those figures, does that suggest to you that PJV management
was making a conscious attempt in the four months following
the explosion to
maximise open pit direct feed to the mill?
<P>

A. We would always try to maximise open pit direct feed to the mill providing
it didn't displace higher grade underground feed.
<P>

Q. I want you to accept also that the average of the total tonnes fed through
the mills for the month of September, October, November,
December 1994 was some
9,000 tonnes less than Mr Weldon's projected figure for August, but that the
open pit direct feed tonnages
for each of those months was some 16,000 tonnes
more than the projected figure for August. 
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Would you agree with me again - I withdraw the word "again" - would you
agree with me that that indicates a conscious attempt
on the part of the mine's
management to make up in September to December the open pit direct feed that
was lost in August?
<P>

A. No.
<P>

Q. You say, do you, assuming those figures are correct, that's simply what
would have happened anyway?
<P>

A. I can't picture all the figures in my mind. We would endeavour each day at
the operation to maximise the gold produced from the
operation. So we would do
whatever is appropriate to maximise gold production. If that means higher or
lower proportions of open
pit direct feed or stockpile feed, then so be it.
It's a function of endeavouring to maximise our gold production each day. 
<P>

Q. What I want to suggest to you is that the ore production that I have put to
you, assuming that the figures are correct, reflects
in part the preparatory
work that was able to be carried out in August whilst the mill was closed down
and the underground and open
pit mines were closed down?
<P>

A. I don't think that any preparatory work that was carried out during those 20
days, or whatever, would follow through for several
months. It's more a
function of the stage 1 pit getting further into the ore body, I would
think."
<P>

(T1075.57-1077.3)
<P>

417  	I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that evidence which
lends support for the Weldon analysis. 
<P>

418  	On the evidence of Hood I think the record of ore production
from the open pit post August 1994 should be treated as reflecting
no more than
a full exploitation of the resource which the PJV was entitled to do and which
in no way represented a conscious or
unintended recovery of the lost gold
production from the open pit in August 1994. 
<P>

419  	As a matter of principle I think it is clear that Rowley
accepts the validity of the pragmatic approach to lost production
from the open
pit adopted by Weldon, while maintaining that the PJV had the ability to
recover the lost gold production by selective
mining of the open pit and a
selective proportion of feed stock to the mill. 
<P>

420  	In any event I am satisfied, in the absence of a more reliable
tool, that the Weldon approach to this assessment of loss is
reliable and
should be acted upon. Weldon's estimate of grade in the lost ore production was
6.28 g/t. He reached that estimate via
a route not dissimilar to that of Rowley
and his estimate, in my view, should be accepted.
<P>

421  	Rowley's evidence explaining his calculation was as follows:
<P>

"[MR JACKMAN] Q. And your figure that you come to for projected head grade is
6.2 grams per tonne, isn't it?
<P>

A. That is based on the four months average for that period, yes.
<P>

Q. So you are not saying by reference to December 1997 that the 6.28 grams per
tonne is too high?
<P>

A. I was originally saying that I believed that it should be as low, at 5.16,
which is the total feed, but I am, on the basis of
my overall concept of the
four months before and after principle, prepared to live with 6.20 as the head
grade in relation to the
open pit feed lost.
<P>

(T1513.2-T1513.14)
<P>

422  	The PJV mads a further claim associated with the cost of
handling the open pit stockpile ore that was used as mill feed in
August 1994
when, if it had been available, direct feed from the open pit would have been
used. In my view the likelihood is high
that at some stage that cost would have
been incurred in the exhausting of the stockpile. I think the claim should be
treated as
costs which the PJV would incur regardless of the effect of the
explosions. 
<P>

423  	An additional claim is made in respect of extra costs incurred
in the longer haulage of mined material which resulted from
a forced change in
the location of stockpile sites following the explosions. This claim is related
to the requirement of the Mines
Department following the explosions that the
explosives plant facilities be relocated to a generally unstable area in what
had been
designed for use as the SDC dump. The instability of the SDC dump
interfered with its orderly, continuous use as a dump. I have dealt
with the
change in the location of the explosives plant and found that the change should
not be said to be one likely to have been
made independently of the effect of
the explosions. The consequence of this loss of space for dumping material was
the forced move
to a dump site known as the Lower Kogai dump to which the haul
time was much greater than that to the SDC dump. This involved open
pit
production losses due to haulage truck constraints until additional trucks were
put into service on 29 March and 4 April 1995.
The order for those trucks was
not placed until the first week in January 1995. It was part of Dyno's case
that usage of the SDC
dump up to March 1995 was inconsistent with the PJV claim
of forced usage of Lower Kogai.
<P>

424  	However, Hood's cross-examination on this subject made it
clear, I think, that the actual use of the SDC dump in that period
was the
maximum usage available, due to the soil conditions peculiar to that area. It
was not submitted that additional trucks should
have been ordered prior to
January 1995. I raised that matter with Weldon as follows: in the course of
arranging joint reports by
the experts for the respective parties:
<P>

"[His Honour] Q. Is there any issue about the optimum use of trucks? For
example, inadequate supply of trucks or of a capacity to
increase the number of
trucks to --
<P>

A. I don't think --
<P>

Q. -- to take away the dump material.
<P>

A. I don't think there is an issue about a truck constraint. I think some of
the other experts believe that the truck constraint
was aggravated by a number
of unrelated issues. 
<P>

Q. Yes. That is fine.
<P>

A. My own view on that is that if there is other issues which existed, and the
truck constraint was particularly severe at the time,
then any additional
problem caused by the explosion must more directly have led to the operational
problems that we are going to
talk about. In terms of whether there is an issue
on the timing of purchase of trucks, I am not aware of any issue on that."
<P>

(T888.3-T888.25)
<P>

425  	It was submitted on behalf of Niugini Insurance that this head
of claim is too remote: that the Mines Department's direction
to relocate the
explosives plant was an unforeseeable event. I do not agree.
<P>

426  	Weldon's analysis is based upon the proposition that the pit
production was truck dependant. That contention does not appear
to be
challenged. Rowley's opinion was that the claimed interference with production
of ore was irrelevant as the critical factor
was the mill capacity which, on
production figures, he considered was fully utilised. Weldon's counter was that
the loss was not
measured against under utilisation of the mill - that it was
based upon the retarding of direct feed to the mill of the higher grade
open
cut ore and the consequent loss of gold production. 
<P>

427  	It was submitted on behalf of Niugini Insurance that there was
no evidence to support that lost production of ore. That submission
overlooks
the evidence of Hood (Ex AC) in which he verified the following statement:
<P>

"<b>11.1 Equipment </b>In addition to increased operating costs, which are
dealt with <b>Constraints </b>below, the longer haul took more time - there
were less cycles per day. The capacity to produce from the pit was truck
limited, and
this situation was aggravated by the need to assign trucks to the
Lower Kogai. This truck shortage persisted until the end of March
1995."
<P>

(Exhibit X)
<P>

428  	The calculation by Weldon of reduced production, I think, is
the only reliable attempt to assess the value of a significant
constraint on
open pit production. Accordingly, I think the Weldon analysis of lost
production should be adopted. I have been invited
to discount the claim on the
basis that "there were many other circumstances that could have contributed
significantly to any truck
constraint." Although I think the assessment is at
the top end of an estimate of the loss, I think any "substantial reduction in
the amount claimed", would be arbitrary.
<P>

429  	Associated with the Lower Kogai dump, the PJV has calculated
the increased cost of the longer hauls to that dump when compared
with the
hauls to the SDC dump. The Weldon calculation, in my view, is completely
reliable and supported, in substance, by the evidence
of Hood. The only
qualification I have in accepting that quantification, lies in the reliability
of Hood's evidence as to the haul
distances involved in Weldon's calculation.
Hood's initial description of haul distances used a map "showing the relative
distances
of hauls to the SDC and Kogai dump sites" It did not support Hood's
calculations, as demonstrated by Hall. However, I think Hood's
oral evidence
explaining the discrepancy and supporting his calculations by his observations
and experience on site should be accepted.

<P>

430  	Weldon was criticised for his adjustment of costs in the
estimate of increased haulage costs to accommodate changes in cost
accounting
adopted by the PJV in 1996 and which he described as follows:
<P>

"[MR WELDON] A. I think that MineConsult's view is that one would look at the
costs over 1994, 1995 and 1996 and get an inflation
adjusted sample of those
costs and apply that over the entire period such that the 1996 costs do in fact
have some influence over
the entire loss period. But I don't know that I think
that's quite the right way to apply that calculation.
<P>

I prefer to apply the costs year-by-year and then I run into a difficulty in
doing that because we don't have the right information
for 1996.
<P>

The information in 1996 is clearly categorised in a very different way and does
not appear to include all of the information or
even aggregate all of the
information which was provided for prior years for trucking costs. So it seems
that the 1996 data is incomplete
when you are trying to determine the actual
costs of operating a truck in 1996.
<P>

For that reason, we omitted 1996 from our costs calculations because it
appeared to be misleading."
<P>

(T1152.12-T1152-37)
<P>

431  	I accept that explanation by Weldon evidencing a reasonable
approach in his method of costing this aspect of the PJV's claim.

<P>

432  	The extent of the PJV's overhead and labour costs recoverable
under its business interruption claim was assessed by Weldon
without allowance
for any such costs that were recovered from Niugini Insurance in the PJV's
material damage claim under sec 1 of
the endorsed policy. It was the opinion of
Kerr and Rowley that there was an overlap in the two claims for material damage
and business
interruption, respectively. 
<P>

433  	The PJV's position on this issue, in my view, is barely
tenable. In brief, the PJV contends that the business interruption
claim is one
in general damages, not special damages with the consequence that recovery does
not depend on proof of pecuniary loss.
As authority for that proposition the
PJV relied upon <b>The Mediana</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20AC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] AC 113</a> and that line of authority
which recognised the right to recover compensation in respect of services
provided gratuitously to the
injured party. Neither line of authority supports
the PJV's position, in my view. 
<P>

434  	In <b>The Mediana</b>, the House of Lords was concerned with
the assessment of damages following a collision which put out of commission the
plaintiff's
lightship. As part of its claim the plaintiff sought recovery of
damages representing the loss of the use of its vessel. The House
of Lords held
that the plaintiff was so entitled. Of significance in that case was the fact
that the plaintiff covered the loss of
use of its lightship by putting into
service a spare lightship which it kept for just such an emergency. Clearly,
the plaintiff suffered
a 'loss' in the sense that it carried the expense of
providing a substitute vessel about all year round. That fact clearly played
a
significant role in the reasoning of the House of Lords. In the speech of Lord
Halsbury his Lordship distinguished the Privy Council
decision in the <b>City
of Peking v Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2015%20AC%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 15 App Cas 438</a> which
also concerned a claim for the loss of the use of the plaintiff's damaged
vessel during a period in which a replacement vessel
was employed. However, the
distinguishing feature of that case, as observed by Lord Halsbury, was that the
substitute vessel's costs
were to the account of the defendant. To allow
damages for loss of use of the plaintiff's ship would visit a duplication of
damages
upon the defendant. In <b>The Mediana</b>, the plaintiff's loss
included the loss of use of its lightship and it could be of no avail to the
wrongdoer that the plaintiff had
incurred an expense in having available a
replacement vessel. 
<P>

435  	Lord Brampton expressed the compensation entitlement of the
plaintiff in the following way (at pp 122-123):
<P>

"One word however, I desire to say with regard to the <i>Orion</i>, which was
the substituted vessel in this case. She had been built by the respondents and
was maintained by them at great expense
in order that as between themselves and
the public they might have ready means at their command to obviate the great
danger and inconvenience
which might arise from such a misfortune as befell the
<i>Comet</i> by the negligence of the appellants ; but as between themselves
and the wrongdoer causing the damage to the <i>Comet </i>they were under no
obligation whatsoever to use the <i>Orion</i> at all. They might have use a
hired vessel had they so pleased, in which case the liability for the hire
would have been clear. But
the respondents prudently, having a vessel suited
for the purpose lying idle, thought it right in their discretion to use her
instead
of hiring perhaps a less efficient substitute for the <i>Comet. </i>The
services of the <i>Orion</i>, however, were valuable, and why should the
appellants claim to have them gratuitously, including the wages of the men who
might
have been employed on board her? They might equally claim gratuitously to
have the services of skilled workmen - engineers hired
by the year and paid by
the respondents - who happened at the time to be idle, or to have no particular
work in hand. That cannot
be, and in my judgment is not, the law."
<P>

436  	<b>The Mediana </b>and the gratuitous services cases are
illustrations of loss in which the wrongdoer, as a matter of policy, is not
entitled to take
advantage of benefits bestowed upon the injured party. 
<P>

437  	In this case the evidence calls for an examination of the PJV's
claim as a whole to ensure that there is no duplication of
recovery. No point
has been taken on the basis that recovery by the PJV of its material damage
claim was affected, in substance,
under the endorsed policy against the insurer
and not directly against Dyno: the subject of that recovery under sec 1 of the
endorsed
policy being the subrogation claim which I have disallowed. 
<P>

438  	Clearly, in my view, there is an element of overlap in the
material damage recovery and the business interruption claim. The
extent of
that overlap is not capable of a precise definition. No detailed evaluation was
undertaken by any party. That is not to
say that the material damage claim was
not meticulously recorded by the PJV, including its particular overhead
component. Clearly,
not all overheads in the period of overlap in the two
claims would be recouped under the material damage claim. Kerr's approach
acknowledged
that the material did not enable him "to form an accurate opinion
as to the percentage of... wages costs [in the material damage
recovery] which
were fixed and which were abnormal." He "assumed that all of the overhead
[recovered under the material damages claim]
was a fixed cost." Rowley adopted
a more conciliatory approach in his evidence in chief expressing the opinion
that the labour component
and half the overhead component of the material
damage recovery should be allowed as a credit in the business interruption
loss.
Rowley's reason for adjusting the overhead component credit to half the
amount recovered in the material damage claim was intended
to cover both
unrecovered labour and overhead costs of the PJV as appeared from the following
cross-examination: 
<P>

"Q. Now, once production resumes after the period of shutdown I am asking you
to assume that if those people and other overheads
had not been used to repair
or replace damaged items then they would have been fully occupied in their
day-to-day work in the productive
business of the mine, do you understand
that?
<P>

A. Yes. I understand very well.
<P>

Q. And that is a reasonable assumption, isn't it?
<P>

A. I understand the assumption.
<P>

Q. It is a reasonable assumption, isn't it, or don't you know?
<P>

A. All I know is that after these sort of events people have to live with the
greater workload, and I know that the insured, that
is the PJV, bill their time
within their material damage claim in recovery. The flow-through effect in
terms of monetary terms on
the business is not in any way recorded, and it is
impossible to measure it.
<P>

Q. Yes. Thank you.
<P>

A. And that is part of the reason why, in my methodology, I have recognised a
50 per cent credit.
<P>

Q. And that reflects incremental costs in overheads, does it?
<P>

A. It represents those things."
<P>

(T1521.5-T1521.36)
<P>

439  	It was submitted on behalf of the PJV that had the PJV chosen
to employ contractors to perform the recovery work no question
of duplication
of loss would arise. In substance, I think that is correct. However, in my
view, where the party whose business has
been interrupted and whose property
has been damaged, carried out rectification work with its own labour and claims
that labour and
overheads associated with that work, and where that labour is
employed and those overheads incurred during the period of business
interruption, it is necessary to ensure that any component of labour and
overheads costs in the business interruption claim do not
represent duplication
of claims against the wrongdoers. The recovery of the gratuitous services cases
has no application to that
exercise, in my view. 
<P>

440  	In this case I am satisfied that there is some overlap. The
path I have chosen is to allow a credit as assessed by Rowley
and which amounts
to US$947,650. 
<P>

441  	Two related issues concern the currency in which the PJV's
damages should be expressed and the rate of interest to be allowed
in respect
of those damages. There is little doubt that the damages should be expressed in
United States dollars. Virtually all aspects
of the commercial relationship
amongst the parties and the manner in which the PJV set up and operated the
mine and the currency
in which the mine's production of ore was expressed,
credited and sold, all point to the applicability of that form of currency.

<P>

442  	As between the PJV and Niugini Insurance the only currency
usage was United States currency. As between the PJV and Dyno,
the Dyno
contract was similarly orientated. In terms of a claim against Dyno under the
Dyno contract, I doubt if there could be any
argument against the expression of
such a claim in United States dollars. I fail to see how the position should be
any different
when the claim arising out of that contractual relationship is
founded in tort. 
<P>

443  	The evidence of Paton I think fully supports that approach to
the assessment of damages. Furthermore, I think it was no coincidence
nor act
of capriciousness that resulted in the expression of the financial dealings
amongst the parties in United States dollars.
Presumably, that was a deliberate
commercial decision aimed at selecting a standard and stable currency as the
context for their
commercial dealings. 
<P>

444  	I think it is a matter of little or no relevance that in the
operation of the mine and in the performance of rectification
work that resort
to funding with Kina or Australian dollars was necessary. 
<P>

445  	The expression of damages in United States dollars, I think,
carries with it the corollary that the applicable interest rate
should be
associated with that economic system in which the United States dollar operates
rather than interest rates referable to
s 94 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>.
Ideally that rate would reflect the cost of replacement in that economic system
of the dollars lost by reason of the damages sustained
as a result of the
explosions. There is no direct evidence of that rate. I note that the
feasibility study in 1988 considered the
project's feasibility on both an
equity funded basis and a 75% bank funded basis. In the latter case a 9%
interest rate was used.
The defendants have evidenced "52-week Treasury Bills"
rates for the years 1994 to 1999. They were mostly around the 5-7% mark in
1994
and 1995: around 5.5% in 1996 and 1997 and 4.5% to 5% in 1998-1999. The
defendants rely upon the Treasury bill rates in the
absence of evidence of the
funding and investment practices of the members of the PJV whose domiciles
include Australia and North
America. Niugini Insurance, on that basis, proposed
an average rate of 5% dating from September 1994. I think an average rate of
6%
dating from September 1994 is appropriate, as one more likely to reflect the
cost of replacing the lost dollars within the economic
system applicable to the
United States currency. I think it does that by reflecting a margin over
Treasury bill rates and by carrying
an in-built adjustment in favour of the PJV
by applying the rate from September 1994: that represents a favourable rate
having regard
to the timing of losses incurred in the business interruption
claim. 
<P>

446  	Dyno's claim as an insured against Niugini Insurance consists
of its sec II claim in respect of the PJV's material damage
and business
interruption claims and Dyno's sec I claim in respect of its own material
damage suffered as a result of the explosions.
<P>

447  	Niugini Insurance and Dyno have reached agreement on the
quantum of Dyno's claim against Niugini Insurance as follows: 
<P>

"C. Dyno's claim for its unrecovered losses
<P>

C.1 Dyno and NIC have agreed the quantum of the claim brought by Dyno in 
<P>

respect of its unrecovered losses as follows:
<P>

<P>

<P>

<b>TOTAL USD685,357 Interest on the amounts referred to above"</b>
<P>

448  	Niugini Insurance denies liability in respect of Dyno's sec II
claim on the basis of exception (e) to sec II which excludes:
<P>

"claims which are the subject of indemnity under Section I of this policy or
which would have been the subject of indemnity under
Section I but for the
application of the deductible(s) thereunder."
<P>

449  	Neither Dyno's sec I claim nor its sec II claim fall into that
category, with the possible exception of the PJV betterment
claim. However,
while the PJV was indemnified in respect of replacement costs of the explosives
facility, the betterment claim was
not the subject of indemnity. Nor could it
be said that the PJV would have been indemnified but for the 'application of
the deductibles'.
For those reasons, in my view, the exclusion has no
application to Dyno's sec II claim. 
<P>

450  	Niugini Insurance also resisted liability in respect of Dyno's
sec II claim on the following basis:
<P>

"8.4 To the extent that Dyno's liability arises from causes not involving
property damage to PJV's property, such liability does
not fall within the
insuring clause of section II of the policy, which is directed to liability
arising out of personal injury or
property damage. Liability for the following
would not fall within the insuring clause of section II:-
<P>

&#183; losses due to shortage of explosives or low morale of staff;
<P>

&#183; losses due to truck constraints or longer hauls to the Kogai dump;
<P>

&#183; additional rehandling costs;
<P>

&#183; costs of a blast investigation which occurred regardless of whether
there was property damage; and 
<P>

&#183; payments due to the necessity to maintain peace with locals and
contractors by compensating them for their losses irrespective
of the legal
liability to do so."
<P>

451  	However that submission pays no, or insufficient regard to the
ambit of the Sec II insuring clause which provided as follows:
<P>

<u>"INSURING CLAUSE</u>
<P>

The insurers will, subject to the exceptions and conditions hereinafter
mentioned:
<P>

(a) indemnify the Insured for all sums which the Insured shall become
legally
<P>

liable to pay in respect of or arising out of:
<P>

(i) Bodily injury or illness (including death at any time resulting therefrom)
suffered or alleged to have been suffered by any
person or persons.
<P>

(ii) Damage to or destruction of property <u>including the loss of use
thereof</u> 
<P>

<u>iterruption (sic), denial of access, loss of trade or other
deprivations</u>.
<P>

happening during the Period of Insurance in connection with the project and
caused by an occurrence. 
<P>

for the purpose of this Insurance the word 'occurrence' means an event
including injurious exposure to conditions, which unexpectedly
or
unintentionally results in bodily injury or property damage or any
consequential losses arising therefrom."
<P>

(emphasis added)
<P>

452  	The business interruption elements in Dyno's sec II claim all
fall within "the loss of use [of property] iterruption (sic),
denial of access,
loss of trade or other deprivations": an extension of the meaning of "damage to
or destruction of property." In
any event, that part of Dyno's sec II claim, in
my view, also falls within a loss in respect of or arising out of the
unextended
meaning of "Damage to or destruction of property".
<P>

453  	I also think that the items the subject of the agreed quantum
schedule of the PJV's claims are each capable of falling within
a legal
liability of Dyno "in respect of or arising out of ...damage to or destruction
of property including the loss of use thereof
[interruption], denial of access,
loss of trade or other deprivations." The effect of the evidence of Carpenter
was that the payments
were both reasonable and necessary to minimise the loss
arising out of the interruption to the works or the "loss of trade or other
deprivations" caused by the explosions. In some instances the payments were
condoned by Niugini Insurance . The 'investigation' costs
I regard as a
necessary concomitant of the explosions and of the destruction of property and
lives and, to that extent, capable of
falling within both sub-paragraphs (i)
and (ii) of the insuring clause.
<P>

454  	Dyno's Sec II losses are also denied indemnification on the
basis that they fall within exception g) which excluded the cover
from
"liquidated damages fines or penalties payable by the Insured or any sum
payable by the Insured by way of damages for breach
of contract." In my view,
none of the losses should be so categorised in view of the findings made
earlier in these reasons. 
<P>

455  	Niugini Insurance relies upon exception b) to sec II of the
endorsed policy. Par b) provided as follows:
<P>

"b. liability for loss of or damage to property owned by or in the care,
custody or control of the insured other than loss of or
damage to:
<P>

i) the personal possessions including vehicles and their contents of Directors,
Partners, employees or Visitors of the Insured.
<P>

ii) premises and their contents not owned, leased or rented to the Insured but
which premises are temporarily occupied by the Insured
for the purposes of the
project."
<P>

456  	Given the quantum agreement, which had the effect of limiting
the PJV's material damage claim, there is no part of Dyno's
sec II claim to
which this exclusion could apply, in my view. The explosives facility building
which was the subject of the betterment
claim was not a building "owned by or
in the care, custody or control" of Dyno. If I am wrong, in that view, then to
the extent that
it might be regarded as being in Dyno's control, I think it
fell within the description of "premises ...temporarily occupied by [Dyno]
for
the purposes of the project".
<P>

457  	In relation to Dyno's sec I claim, Niugini Insurance has
declined liability on the basis of exception l) which precludes recovery
of
loss of "catalysts and chemicals, ...fuel, oil etc. unless such loss is the
direct consequence of insured damage to other parts
of the works covered under
this policy." 
<P>

458  	Part of Dyno's sec I claim is for loss of "consigned raw
materials". Niugini Insurance claims that the loss so described related
to the
stored emulsion and related components of explosives. As I understood the
argument of Niugini Insurance, it was necessary
for Dyno to show that the loss
was connected with damage to the property of Dyno insured by the endorsed
policy. I do not agree with
that construction and bring back to mind the
'pervasive' interest of Dyno in the whole of the property insured. In any
event, Dyno
had an insurable interest in the leased equipment sufficient to
satisfy Niugini Insurance's test.
<P>

459  	In so far as Dyno's sec I claim includes claims related to the
leased equipment, Niugini Insurance relies upon cl 3 of the
settlement deed
which is repeated for ease of reference: 
<P>

<b>"3. The Leased Equipment </b>
<P>

The Insureds further agree that the consideration for this Deed includes an
amount to be paid by the Underwriters with respect to
loss and/or damage to the
Leased Equipment, and that such amount is in full and final satisfaction of all
claims with respect to
such loss and damage, now or hereafter available to or
claimed by the Insureds, Dyno Wesfarmers Ltd or any other party having an
interest in the Leased Equipment, and the Insureds accordingly warrant:
<P>

(i) that they will indemnify the <b>Underwriters against any claim (including
</b>the costs and expenses thereof) made by the Insureds, Dyno Wesfarmers Ltd
and/or any associated, subsidiary or parent companies thereof;
and 
<P>

(ii) that there are no other parties having or claiming an interest <b>of
</b>any <b>kind </b>whatsoever in the Leased Equipment."
<P>

460  	This clause should be read in conjunction with the terms of the
Dyno release which were as follows:
<P>

<b>"THE PARTIES AGREE AND DECLARE AS FOLLOWS:</b>
<P>

1. Upon receipt of the said sum of A$3,517,807 under the Policy the Joint
Venturers shall pay it to DWL and the receipt of that
sum by DWL is hereby
acknowledged.
<P>

2. DWL warrants that it is the sole legal and equitable owner of the Leased
Equipment and that no other party has or claims an interest
of any kind in
it.
<P>

3. DWL hereby indemnifies the Joint Venturers and the Manager and each of them
against any liability (including any and all liability
for the costs and
expenses of investigating, defending or prosecuting any claim) arising from any
claim by DWL or any other person
in respect of the loss or damage to the Leased
Equipment."
<P>

461  	Niugini Insurance also relies upon the general release given to
it by the PJV in relation to the sec I payout under cl 1 of
the settlement deed
and to the provision in cl 4 imposing a duty on the PJV to assist Niugini
Insurance in defence of such a claim
as that made by Dyno.
<P>

462  	That only adds to the validity of a defence of circuity of
action which I think is available to Niugini Insurance in respect
of each of
the items in Dyno's sec I claim "in respect of the loss or damage to the Leased
Equipment". That would include the claim
for overheads.
<P>

463  	In the case of the overheads component in Dyno's sec I claim,
Dyno makes no claim for overheads in relation to "consigned
raw materials". 
<P>

464  	Legal costs are the subject of an agreed statement. Under sec
II of the endorsed policy, the insurance clause extended the
indemnity to cover
the following:
<P>

"(c) ...
<P>

(i) All expenses incurred by or with the permission of Insurers for
investigation, negotiation and defence of claims and suits
<P>

(ii) All expenses incidental to the appeal from any judgement (sic) against the
Insured subject to the consent of the Insures (sic)
<P>

(iii) All expenses in connection with any other court actions or legal
proceedings arising out of an occurrence insured against
hereunder."
<P>

465  	It is argued by Dyno and Niugini Insurance that Dyno incurred
legal costs and expenses in relation to an inquiry appointed
on 4 August 1994
under s 59 of the Mining (Safety) Act (PNG) Ch.195A established to ascertain
the causes of the explosions. It was
completed by 18 January 1995.
<P>

466  	On 6 February 1995 the Mines Department lodged an
administrative appeal under the Mining (Safety) Act (PNG) - It did not proceed
as a result of the pending hearing of charges against Dyno in the District
Court. On 8 February 1995 Dyno successfully challenged
that decision not to
proceed, the appeal being upheld on 10 February 1995. In July 1995 an
originating summons was lodged in the
National Court to enforce, in effect, a
hearing of the administrative appeal by having the National Court conduct a
judicial review.
That tactic was successful in that the Mines Department
decided that it had sufficient funds to carry out the administrative appeal.

<P>

467  	On 8 January 1996 there was a procedural hearing in the
administrative appeal and on 12 February 1996 an interlocutory application
was
heard. In March 1996 Twaddle brought down his decision in the appeal
overturning the finding of the statutory inquiry.
<P>

468  	Dyno has been engaged in litigation with Rodney Dugmore in
respect of personal injuries suffered as a result of the explosions.
Dugmore's
solicitors have submitted a statement of accounts which are to Dyno's account
but which are not agreed to by Niugini Insurance.
<P>

469  	In my view, costs so incurred by Dyno fall within insuring
clause par (c)(iii) in the case of the public inquiries and under
par c (i) or
c (iii) in relation to Dugmore's claim.
<P>

470  	The basis of entitlement is not limited to costs necessarily
incurred. It extends to costs reasonably incurred although not
necessarily
incurred. The level of entitlement is on the basis of an indemnity. I doubt if
the evidentiary onus of Dyno in proving
its costs would prove a difficult task
having regard to the failure of Niugini Insurance to indemnify Dyno under the
endorsed policy.

<P>

471  	By its third and fourth cross claims Niugini Insurance seeks
contribution respectively from Vesta Forsikring A/S (Vesta) and
General
Accident Insurance Asia Ltd (GAC) in respect of its payout under sec II of the
endorsed policy : each of GAC and Vesta having
provided public liability cover
to Dyno for the period covering the explosions. Each has denied liability. 
<P>

472  	It is accepted by Niugini Insurance that any entitlement to
contribution is limited to the indemnification of Dyno's public
liability
risks.
<P>

473  	In the case of Vesta, it relied upon cl 7.5 of its policy which
provided as follows:
<P>

"7. Limitations of Vesta's liability
<P>

The insurance does not cover liability:
<P>

....
<P>

7.5 For claims to such extent as compensation is paid out under mandatory or
other liability insurance policies taken out by the
Insured or co-insured,
under a Builders All Risk policy or under other insurance held by the principal
or any other party." 
<P>

474  	The policy wording is unambiguous and applied literally would
require its application as an excess or second layer of insurance.
Evidence was
adduced in Vesta's case that the English wording of the Vesta policy was taken
from the Norwegian language form of its
standard policy clauses: that in the
case of cl 7.5 the words "paid out" are the English translation of the
Norwegian "erstattes"
which, more accurately translated, means "indemnifiable".
I think that is the meaning in which the phrase "paid out" is used, in
any
event, in cl 7.5. I have treated this reliance upon extrinsic material as
falling within the principles of statutory interpretation
referred to in the
reasons that follow. 
<P>

475  	Niugini Insurance accepts that Norwegian law is the proper law
of the Vesta policy. However, its claim for contribution is
not one founded in
contract, but is in the nature of an equitable right to contribution arising
out of a case of double insurance.

<P>

476  	There is no dispute that if the law governing the Niugini
Insurance's entitlement to contribution was that of New South Wales,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 45</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a> would avoid cl 7.5, so far as it purported to
apply to the endorsed policy. 
<P>

477  	Vesta adduced in its case the evidence of Erling Christie Hjort
(Hjort), an expert in Norwegian law, to the effect that Norwegian
Law is based
upon statutory material consisting of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Act of 1814, statutes of
Norway's Parliament and subordinated legislation and regulations. Statutory
interpretation embraced construction
of the terms of the statutory instrument;
resort to reports in the nature of explanatory memoranda; judicial decisions;
practice
of government authorities; custom; learned texts and a principle of
interpretation aimed at achieving a just result. 
<P>

478  	In relation to custom and the justice of the case it was
Hjort's evidence that a: 
<P>

"...Norwegian court applying Norwegian law would take the following matters
into account in interpreting an insurance policy in
the appropriate
circumstances:
<P>

(1) The wording of the actual clause in the policy;
<P>

(2) The policy's other provisions;
<P>

(3) Oral and written negotiations leading up to the placement of the policy;
<P>

(4) The parties' intended understanding of the clause if such understanding 
<P>

deviates from the wording of the policy;
<P>

(5) Industry practice in Norway."
<P>

479  	He evidenced the insured's right under Norwegian law to sue
Vesta as follows:
<P>

"4.1 Under Norwegian law, contracting parties are entitled to sue each other
pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Procedures
Act of 13 August 1915 No 6
Sections 53 and 54.
<P>

The grounds for such litigation might be a claim for the fulfilment of a
contract or for damages resulting from the breach of it
by the other
contracting party. The underlying principle is that agreements shall be adhered
to ("pacta sunt servanda") which has
been recognised in Norwegian law since
time immemorial. The present authority for this rule is found in King Christian
V Norwegian
Statute ("Norske Lov") of April 15th 1687 book 5, article 2.
<P>

In the present time Norwegian law on agreement is found in the Contract Act of
May 31st 1918 No 4, which contains provisions regarding
how agreements are
made, under what circumstances they may become valid etc."
<P>

480  	As evidence of practice, Hjort stated that cl 7.5 was a clause
known in the industry as a "local insurance clause" or "subordination
clause".
Its use in the insurance industry related to the provision of 'global' cover to
insureds engaged in international commerce
and which was 'subordinate' to
'local' insurance. In that form it operated as a form of 'excess' insurance. He
gave examples of that
practice. Hjort expressed the opinion that "the relevant
law and custom to which [he had referred led] to the conclusion that Clause
7.5
excludes the operation of the Vesta policy until the NIC policy has been
exhausted." Although not specifically objected to, I
have some doubt about the
admissibility of that opinion, at least in that form.
<P>

481  	However, if not explicitly stated, I think it should be
concluded from Hjort's evidence that Norwegian law would enforce a
"local
insurance clause" such as cl 7.5. If that be so, and Norwegian law is the
applicable law of contribution, then Niugini Insurance
would have no right to
contribution from Vesta. 
<P>

482  	However, it is submitted on behalf of Niugini Insurance that
the applicable law is that of New South Wales. That submission
is founded on a
number of alternative bases. It is contended that the evidence of Hjort falls
short of proving Norwegian law as to
contribution and fails to prove the
factual bases upon which a Norwegian Court would construe cl 7.5. 
<P>

483  	Certainly, the form of the evidence is unsatisfactory. It went
in without objection and was not the subject of cross-examination.
Evidence of
industry practice might be expected to emanate from an insurance underwriter.
Hjort is a highly qualified lawyer. Still
his expertise is also based upon the
following:
<P>

"1.5 I have a wide experience in international trade law and I have particular
experience in insurance, banking and shipping law.
My experience in insurance
matters includes, but is not limited to, advising insurers in claims matters
and appearing for them in
litigious matters. I presently hold, and have for the
last five years held, the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of
Oslo Reinsurance Company ASA which is a company listed on the Oslo Stock
Exchange and which was previously known as UNI Storebrand
International
Insurance Company AS. Oslo Reinsurance Company ASA has no involvement or
interest in the claim which is the subject
of these proceedings."
<P>

(Exhibit XD-1)
<P>

484  	In my view, there is sufficient evidence of the Norwegian
insurance practice relating to subordinate or local insurance clauses
to
justify the finding that cl 7.5 is such a clause and enforceable as such under
Norwegian law. It was Niugini Insurance's further
contention that Norwegian law
was irrelevant to the question of contribution: that right being founded in
equity, not in contract.
That the entitlement arises ex-contract is
uncontroversial. In R.P. Meagher, W.M.C. Gummow and J.R.F. Lehane, 'Equity
Doctrines &amp;
Remedies' (3rd ed 1992) at par 1000 et seq the learned authors
trace the development of the doctrine at law and in equity and identify
the
doctrine as one founded in the concept of "natural justice."
<P>

485  	The rationale behind Niugini Insurance's submission was the
subject of analysis by McLelland J in <u>United States Surgical Corporation v
Hospital Products International Pty</u> <u>Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20766" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 766</a> at 796 et
seq.
<P>

486  	McLelland J's reasoning did not call for consideration on
appeal in either the Court of Appeal or in the High Court. However,
his
Honour's reasoning was reviewed in association with other authorities on the
subject in <b>Paramasivam v Flynn </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1711.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1711</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20160%20ALR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 160 ALR 203</a> at 214 et seq., a
decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia. Clearly there is
no entrenched rule, in my view,
which compels the application of the lex fori
in a case such as this. 
<P>

487  	I have some difficulty in applying New South Wales law in the
circumstances of this case where the effect of Niugini Insurance's
submission
would be to avoid cl 7.5 as a clause struck down by the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 45</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a> (Cth). The difficulty I have lies in the
striking down of a clause in a Norwegian contract of insurance, which would be
enforceable
under Norwegian law, in a claim for contribution by an insurer
under a contract of insurance of which the proper law is that of Papua
New
Guinea. While there has been no attempt to prove the law of contribution in
Papua New Guinea, I think there is something bizarre
in applying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 45</a> to the
Vesta policy in those circumstances and where the clear intention of the
parties under Norwegian law was to provide subsidiary
insurance to a group of
corporations trading internationally. In my view, recognition should be given
to the enforceability of such
a clause under Norwegian law which it is conceded
is the proper law of the contract. 
<P>

488  	GAC's policy contained the following endorsement: 
<P>

"It is understood and agreed that the following Papua New Guinea Jurisdiction
Endorsement is attached to and forms part of this
policy, replacing and
cancelling any other jurisdiction clause contained within the policy.
<P>

<center>PAPUA NEW GUINEA JURISDICTION
<P>

<u>ENDORSEMENT</u></center>
<P>

"The indemnity expressed in this policy shall not apply to or include
compensation for damages in respect of judgement (sic) not
in the first
instance delivered by or obtained from a Court of competent jurisdiction within
Papua New Guinea or costs and expenses
of litigation recovered by any claimant
from the insured which are not included in or recoverable in Papua New
Guinea"."
<P>

489  	It was submitted on behalf of GAC that the endorsement had the
effect of limiting GAC's liability to damages under a judgment
in Papua New
Guinea obtained at first instance. I do not think that is the true construction
of the clause, which, in any event,
is not free from ambiguity. 
<P>

490  	In the first instance the endorsement cannot be read literally
to limit any liability of GAC to indemnify Dyno to "compensation
for damages in
respect of judgment... in the first instance delivered by or obtained from a
Court of competent jurisdiction within
Papua New Guinea". For example, the
obligation to indemnify Dyno independently of any such judgment for
"compensation for damages"
is recognised by condition 3 which entitles GAC to
discharge its liability to indemnify by paying out under the policy to the
limit
of the indemnity or a lesser sum by way of settlement without such
judgment being given in the first instance in Papua New Guinea.
Second, the
limitation is concerned only with "compensation for damages" whatever the
precise meaning of that phrase may be. Third,
the phrase "or recoverable in
Papua New Guinea" where used within the clause recognises a liability to
indemnify where the liability
of the insured is "recoverable in Papua New
Guinea." It is enough that the liability of the insured is one "recoverable" in
Papua
New Guinea, at least not at first instance. It is plain why this should
be so. The liability to indemnify Dyno was expressed to be
"in connection with
the Business carried on at and from any Place specified in The Schedule." The
schedule identified the business
as "Supply and Manufacturer of Explosives" and
the place of business, "Anywhere in Papua New Guinea Excluding NSP."
<P>

491  	The construction advanced on behalf of GAC would leave Dyno at
the mercy of the injured party in whose hands lay the power
to choose whatever
forum was available to it outside of Papua New Guinea. Such a construction
leads to an absurdity and one that
should be avoided if a reasonable
construction may be found which gives expression to the true intention of the
parties, namely to
limit liability to indemnify, in respect of a damages claim
against the insured, to damages assessed by the application of the law
of Papua
New Guinea. In that context I note that the clause is described as a
"jurisdiction clause".
<P>

492  	In my view, the phrase "recoverable in Papua New Guinea" should
be read as applying to "damages for compensation" and "costs
and expenses".
That construction is more readily accommodated when the phrase preceding the
phrase "recoverable in Papua New Guinea"
is scrutinised. The phrase "which are
not included in" is meaningless unless that part of the limitation on indemnity
is understood
to mean "cost and expenses of litigation which are...included in
a judgment obtained in the first instance in Papua New Guinea."

<P>

493  	So understood the concluding phrase "or recoverable in Papua
New Guinea" should be read distributively, in my view, to apply
to both
"compensation for damages" and "costs and expenses of litigation" which in the
first instance would be recoverable in Papua
New Guinea. 
<P>

494  	Had I been unable to reach such a construction of the clause I
would have been driven to treat it as void for uncertainty
on the basis that
the phrases "indemnity...[for] compensation for damages in respect of judgment"
and "costs and expenses of litigation
recovered by any claimant from the
insured which are not included" are meaningless. In those circumstances I fail
to see why the
Court should lend its assistance to give some operation to the
clause as contended for on behalf of GAC which would lead to an absurdity
of
construction and defeat the equity underlying a right of contribution.
<P>

495  	On the basis of these findings the parties are agreed that the
appropriate basis for contribution should be:
<P>

As between GAC and Niugini Insurance: As to the limit of GAC's liability,
contribution should be equal; 
<P>

As between Vesta and Niugini Insurance: This does not arise.
<P>

496  	It is not necessary to determine whether the value of the
subrogation claim needs to be brought to account in any determination
of the
quantum of contribution by GAC.
<P>

497  	As with the PJV judgment, the judgment to which Dyno is
entitled should be expressed in United States currency and interest
should be
allowed on Dyno's sec I claim at the rate of 6% from September 1994 on the same
reasoning as interest was calculated in
the case of the PJV's entitlement. I am
mindful that Dyno in Appendix D to its submissions sought a calculation of
interest from
16 March 1995. However, consistently with that, I have taken a
rate of interest which is to be calculated from September 1994 in
order to
reflect the appropriate rate of interest which should be applied. Had I allowed
interest from the later date, it would have
been at a higher rate of interest
than 6%.
<P>

498  	Having regard to the findings reached in these reasons, it will
be necessary for the parties to bring in short minutes of
order including
appropriate orders as to costs together with outline submissions in the event
of there being any residual areas of
contention. I direct that short minutes be
exchanged amongst the parties by 5pm 2 February 2000 and that, in the event of
agreement
being reached, short minutes be forwarded to my associate by 5pm 4
February 2000. In the event of disagreement, each party in dispute
is to
forward to my associate by 5pm 8 February 2000 the short minutes of order for
which it contends and outline submissions in
support of those contentions. The
matter will be listed for the making of final orders on 11 February 2000.
<P>

499  	In summary, the PJV's claim by way of subrogation is to be
dismissed as should be its action against Niugini Insurance and
the first,
third and fifth cross-claims. The PJV is to have judgment against Dyno in
respect of its business interruption entitlement
as found, together with the
agreed amount of its material damage claim and its betterment claim. The
business interruption claim
is to be calculated on the basis as assessed by
Weldon save for the claim for rehandling costs and the overheads not recovered
under
the settlement deed, each of which has been disallowed, and subject to
the allowance of the credit for labour and overheads found
to overlap in the
business interruption and other claims of the PJV. The judgment is to be
expressed in United States currency and
to attract interest from 1 September
1994 at the rate of 6% per annum. 
<P>

500  	Dyno is entitled to judgment in respect of its sec I and sec II
claims under the second cross-claims in accordance with my
published findings.
Dyno is also entitled to a declaration of entitlement to legal costs and
expenses indemnified under the policy
on an indemnity basis in accordance with
these reasons. The judgments are to be expressed in United States currency and,
in respect
of the Sec I claim, is to attract interest at 6% per annum from 1
September 1994. The contribution entitlement of Niugini Insurance
under the
fourth cross claim is to be calculated as agreed between the parties.
