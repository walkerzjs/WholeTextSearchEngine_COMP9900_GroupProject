<b><u>12342 of 1994  	PASTERNACKI &amp; Anor   v   CORREY &amp; Ors</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT UPON RELIEF</b>
<P>

1	On 7 August 1998 I gave judgment in this matter, in which I determined that
the contract between the plaintiffs and the first
defendant, Mrs Correy was
unjust and that, in all the circumstances, she was entitled to relief under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</i> 1980</a>.  I invited submissions from the parties as to
the form which that relief should take.  I have since been supplied with
helpful written
submissions, and on 11 February 1999 I heard oral argument on
the matter.
<P>

	<b>Findings of fact</b>
<P>

2	Counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon a number of findings in my judgment in
support of his submissions.  I found that Mrs Correy
was aware of the nature of
a mortgage, that she was borrowing the amount involved on behalf of her son and
that she understood that
she was making her home available as security for that
loan.  I did not find that the behaviour of the plaintiffs (through Mr Smith
or
Mr Pasternacki himself) was unconscionable according to common law principles.
I did find that the circumstances were such that
they knew or should have known
that Mrs Correy was under some emotional pressure from her son.  However, I did
not find that they
understood Henry Correy's financial position and business
prospects to be precarious.  Rather, I found that they were ignorant of
his
situation and, in the circumstances, were put on enquiry. 
<P>

3	In addition, counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon some evidence, about
which I made no finding, suggesting that Mrs Correy herself
received part of
the sum advanced.  In my judgment I referred to a letter, exhibit D1, which
included a direction for payment of
that sum.  That document was prepared by Mr
Smith before he met Mrs Correy on 18 May 1994.  After deduction of costs,
expenses and
an additional amount for interest, the balance of $113,465.95 was
to be paid "to Henry Steven Correy as directed".  Mr Smith gave
evidence that
he drafted the document in that way as he understood that the money was "to be
disbursed as per Henry's business arrangements...".
<P>

4	In the afternoon of 18 May Mr Smith, at Henry Correy's request, prepared a
handwritten direction that the $113,465.95 be disbursed
by two cheques as
follows: $104,280.11 to Young Fast Ltd and $9,185.84 to D. Correy (Mrs Correy).
That document, exhibit D2, was
signed by Mrs Correy and Henry.  How those
figures were arrived at was not explained in the evidence.  Nor was there any
evidence
about the company, Young Fast Ltd but, obviously, it was an enterprise
with which Henry was associated.  Mr Smith then prepared a
letter, exhibit D3,
to the manager of the bank where the trust funds were held, requesting that
several cheques be drawn.  One of
those was to Young Fast Ltd for $103,621 and
another to D. Correy for $9,844.95.  Again, the evidence does not explain why
these
figures are different from those appearing in the direction, exhibit
D2.
<P>

5	The significance of this, of course, is that it suggests that Mrs Correy
herself received about $9,000.  However, she denied having
received any money
at all out of the transaction.  She acknowledged that she had signed the hand
written document, exhibit D2, but
said that she had no recollection of it.  She
did say that a cheque for about $9,000 was prepared in her name, because her
son had
no personal identification with him and needed some cash immediately in
case he had to travel overseas.  She added that, when they
attended the bank,
Henry received an amount of that order in cash.  Mr Smith said that Henry was
anxious to receive the entire sum
in cash that afternoon, and he had to explain
that he could only receive cheques on settlement.  Henry asked whether he could
have
the cheques cashed as he had to get the money to America that night, and
Mr Smith told him that he would have to phone the bank and
see what they could
do for him.
<P>

6	I accept Mrs Correy's evidence that she received no money at all.  Her
evidence to that effect was not tested in cross-examination.
 Her attention was
directed to exhibit D2 and her signature upon it, but she was asked no question
about her need for that amount
of money or what she had planned to do with
it.<b>  </b>The effect of the evidence as a whole is that the transaction was
for the benefit of Henry Correy, and there is nothing else to suggest
that Mrs
Correy herself had any financial interest in it.  We may never know why Henry
wanted a cheque to be drawn in his mother's
name.  The explanation proffered by
Mrs Correy may be correct.  However that may be, I am satisfied that it was not
his intention
that Mrs Correy should receive the proceeds of that cheque and,
in fact, she did not.
<P>

	<b>Plaintiffs' claims</b>
<P>

7	Before turning to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>, I should deal with a
submission by counsel for the plaintiffs that, whether or not Mrs Correy was
entitled to relief under that
Act, they were entitled to recover from her the
amount advanced plus interest.  The statement of claim contains a common money
count
seeking payment of that sum, as well as a claim for possession of the
property.  Even if the mortgage were liable to be set aside,
the fact remains
that a substantial sum of money was lent.  It was argued that that sum and some
amount of interest, even if assessed
at a rate lower than that specified in the
mortgage, was recoverable in accordance with the principles considered by the
High Court
in <i>Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 221.</a>
Some analogy was sought to be drawn with the facts of that case, in which it
was held that a builder was entitled to bring an action
upon a <i>quantum
meruit</i> for the value of work done and material supplied under an oral
building contract, despite the fact that that contract was unenforceable
because of certain provisions of the <i>Builders Licencing Act</i> 1971 (NSW).
It was acknowledged that, if judgment were obtained against Mrs Correy on this
basis, it could be enforced only by the
sale of the house.
<P>

8	Counsel for Mrs Correy submitted, with some force, that the present case is
distinguishable in a number of respects from that
with which the High Court was
dealing.  It is sufficient to say that the plaintiffs' submission cannot be
accepted, given the intervention
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
7(1)</a> of that Act empowers the court to grant relief "for the purpose of
avoiding as far as practicable an unjust consequence or result...".
 If Mrs
Correy is entitled to such relief, it would effectively be defeated by the
course for which the plaintiffs contend.  There
is some parallel with the
judgment of Dunford J in <i>National Australia Bank Ltd v Hall</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) NSW
ConvR 55-684</a>, a case involving a third-party mortgage given by an elderly woman
over her home to secure her liability under guarantees for the
benefit of her
daughter and son-in-law.  In the course of his reasons for determining the
appropriate form of relief under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>, his Honour
said (at 59,913):
<P>

	...if I were to set aside the mortgage but make no order in respect of the
guarantees the effect would be that the property would
be sold by the Sheriff
instead of by the Bank...
<P>

9	The same fate must befall the plaintiffs' alternative submission that, if I
were to set aside the mortgage under the Act,  I could
do so only upon
condition that Mrs Correy repay the amount advanced with interest.  For this
purpose, counsel for the plaintiffs
relied upon the equitable principles
considered by the High Court in <i>Maguire v Markaronis</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2071%20ALJR%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 71 ALJR 781.</a>
To approach the matter in that way would also be to frustrate the flexibility
and beneficial purpose of the Act. 
<P>

	<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a></b>
<P>

10	It is clear that a finding that a contract is unjust does not necessarily
mean that relief under the Act should be granted. 
In <i>Younan &amp; Anor v
Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd</i> (C of A unreported, 21 November 1994)
Mahoney J observed (at p11): 
<P>

	A decision to exercise the power given by the Act involves two things: a
decision that the contract or a portion of it was "unjust";
and a decision
that, this being so, it is "just" to do "one or more of the" things referred to
in s7(1).
<P>

11	On the question whether it would be "just" to grant any of the forms of
relief in s7(1), his Honour added (at p12):
<P>

	Terms referring to justice look primarily to the balance between the competing
parties and "justice" in this sense, involves the
Justinian concept of giving
to every person his due...
<P>

	In the present Act, the terms of it indicate ( subject to what I shall say)
that the court is to form a view as to what in the
circumstances the interests
of each party are and the extent to which the concept of injustice requires
that one be preferred to
the other.
<P>

12	In <i>Younan</i> the court declined to grant relief even though the contract
was found to be unjust: see also <i>Nguyen v Taylor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 48.</a>  In
support of the submission that no relief should be granted in this case,
counsel for the plaintiff relied upon some of the findings
of fact referred to
earlier.  This was not the more familiar case of a third party mortgage, as Mrs
Correy herself was the borrower.
 The plaintiffs, as trustees for the
beneficiaries under a will, have lent a substantial sum of money which has not
been recovered.
 I did not find unconscionable conduct on their part.  Unlike
cases such as <i>Beneficial Finance Corporation Limited v Karavas </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23
NSWLR 256</a> and <i>Teachers Health Investments Pty Ltd v Wynne </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) NSW
Conv R 55-785</a>, I did not find that they were aware that the transaction was
improvident from Mrs Correy's point of view.
<P>

13	On the other hand, as I have said, I am satisfied that the loan was in fact
for the benefit of Henry Correy and that Mrs Correy
received none of it.  The
plaintiffs were aware that she had no prospect of repaying the loan from her
own resources and were on
notice that she was under some emotional pressure.
The circumstances of the transaction, including the haste with which it was
conducted,
should have aroused their suspicion about its providence.  Not only
should they have made proper inquiry themselves about Henry Correy's
business
and his means, they should also have required Mrs Correy to seek advice about
the financial soundness of the arrangement.
<P>

14	A substantial amount of money held on trust has been lent, and the only
prospect of recovery is the sale of the home upon which
the loan was secured.
In that event, Mrs Correy would lose her home and her only significant asset.
As her counsel observed, for
her that would be "the end of the road".  It is
most unlikely that her son would ever come to her aid and, given her status as
borrower
and his as guarantor, she would not appear to be entitled to any
redress from him in law.  On the other hand, the beneficiaries under
the will
might have some recourse against the trustees and they, in turn, against the
solicitors. (In that context, counsel for Mrs
Correy raised the question of the
solicitors' professional indemnity insurance, but I do not think that that is a
matter to which
I could properly have regard). After a consideration of the
conflicting interests of the parties, I remain satisfied that Mrs Correy
is
entitled to relief under the Act.  The more difficult question is the form
which that relief should take.
<P>

15	The plaintiffs contend that I should do no more than defer enforcement of
the mortgage during Mrs Correy's lifetime, so that
she might continue to occupy
the home.  This is a course which was taken in a number of cases: <i>Melverton
v Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) NSW Conv R 55-484</a>,
<i>National Australia Bank Ltd v Hall</i> (supra), <i>Reisch v Commonwealth
Bank of Australia </i>(Simos J, unreported, 13 March 1998).  That course, it
was submitted, would be an adequate remedy and would have the added benefit
of
ensuring that Henry Correy himself could not inherit the property.  
<P>

16	For Mrs Correy, it was argued that the mortgage should be set aside.  Simply
to allow her to occupy the home during her lifetime
would deprive her of the
ability to realise her asset, which she might need to do in later life.  Her
counsel pointed out that there
is no evidence of her testamentary intentions
and, in any event, the order proposed by the plaintiffs would disinherit her
other
son, Carlo, who is innocent of any wrongdoing.
<P>

17	I have not found this question easy to resolve. For the reasons I have
given, the behaviour of Mr Smith in this transaction could
fairly be described
as reckless, but the power to grant relief under the Act must not be used in a
penal or disciplinary manner:
<i>Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Tong</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20482" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 482</a> per Handley JA at 489.  Counsel advanced the two options
which I have outlined, and no intermediate course was suggested in argument.
I
was initially attracted to the plaintiffs' proposal but, upon reflection, I do
not believe that that is the appropriate course.
Unlike the lenders in cases
such as <i>Melverton</i>, the plaintiffs may have recourse against their
solicitors for the loss they have incurred. (In so saying, I do not overlook
the
fact that one of the plaintiffs is also a partner in that firm.)  The
plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against Henry Correy on
his guarantee.  On
the face of it, that is little comfort to them but, if he were to inherit an
interest in the property, an opportunity
to enforce that judgment might present
itself. On the other hand, the plaintiffs' proposal would effectively deprive
Mrs Correy of
her only asset and, in reality, she would have no redress against
anyone.
<P>

18	I have come to the conclusion that Mrs Correy is entitled to the relief
which she seeks, whereby her home is freed of the encumbrance
upon it and she
is relieved of her personal liability under the mortgage.  The mortgage should
be set aside and such ancillary orders
should be made as are necessary. 
<P>

	<b>Henry Correy</b>
<P>

19	The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against Henry Correy for the amount
advanced plus interest at 20% from the date of the
advance.
<P>

	<b>Orders </b>
<P>

20	I request the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to my
reasons. It was agreed that I should not make any order
about costs until I had
determined the question of relief and the parties should have the opportunity
to be heard on that matter.
