<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b> </center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an application by the plaintiff
for judicial review of a determination made by the defendant on 20 March 1999
dismissing
an appeal by the plaintiff pursuant to s 170 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers
Compensation Act 1987</a> </i></b>(the Act) against the assessment by its insurer,
MMI Workers Compensation NSW Pty Limited, of its premiums for the years 1996/97
and
1997/98 by taking into account the wages paid by and claims history of SJP
Formwork (Aust) Pty Limited (SJP Aust) as the <i>"predecessor"</i> of the
plaintiff (SJP NSW) within the meaning of clause 1(2) of Schedule 1 of the
relevant Insurance Premiums Orders (the Orders)
for the relevant years.  
<P>

2   	Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7</a> (ss <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p165" class="autolink_findacts">165</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p175" class="autolink_findacts">175</a>) of the Act is concerned
with the calculation and recovery of insurance premiums.  The Governor, by
Order made on the recommendation
of the Workcover Authority (the Authority),
may fix the manner in which premiums shall be calculated (s 168), premiums
payable by
an employer are to be calculated in the manner fixed by such Order
(s 169), and if an employer claims that an insurer has demanded
a premium which
is in breach of an Order, the employer may apply to the Authority for a
determination of the premium to be charged
(s 170).
<P>

3   	On 22 June 1994, an Insurance Premium Order pursuant to s
168 was gazetted for the premium year commencing 1 July 1994, and
subsequent
Orders were made for the ensuing premium years commencing 1 July 1995, 1996,
and 1997 respectively.  The Orders were,
so far as is material to these
proceedings, in identical terms.  Schedule 3 of the Order related to the "Base
Tariff Premium" ("T"),
Schedule 4 to the "Experience Adjustment Factor" ("S")
and Schedule 5 to the "Experience Premium" ("E").
<P>

4   	In calculating the Experience Adjustment Factor (Schedule
4) and the Experience Premium (Schedule 5), both of which were relevant
to the
calculation of the premium payable, account was to be had of the claims
experience (Schedule 4) and the wages and cost of
claims (Schedule 5) of the
employer, and where during the relevant period (two years in Schedule 4 and a
number of variable periods
in Schedule 5) a predecessor of the employer was
insured, regard was to be had to the particulars of claims and the cost of
claims
and wages, respectively, not only of the employer but of such
predecessor of the employer during the relevant period.  Schedule 1
cl 1(2)was
as follows:
<P>

"For the purposes of this Order, a person is the predecessor of an employer if
the employer has acquired the business of the person.
 This subclause applies
whether the business acquired is the whole or main part of the business of the
person or is the whole or
main part of a separate and distinct business of the
person, and whether or not the business acquired is carried on at the same
location."
<P>

5   	The facts which were before the Delegate of the defendant
and which appear in the Determination included the following.  SJP
Aust was
incorporated on 25 June 1986 with two shareholders, Steve Pejkovic and his
wife, Lydia.  It was trustee for the Pejkovic
Family Trust and operated as a
formwork, steel fixing and concreting contractor.  Its director was Steve
Pejkovic and its registered
office and principal place of business was 653
Darling Street, Rozelle.  It started to lay off its staff in June 1995, but
continued
to trade in its own right until December 1995 when it retrenched all
its staff.  On 23 May 1996 an administrator was appointed and
about the same
time a receiver-manager was appointed by the Commonwealth Bank who held
security over all its assets.  Ultimately
on 10 July 1996 the company went into
liquidation and the administrator became the liquidator.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff was formerly known as SJP Constructions Pty
Limited and was incorporated on 20 March 1990 and its name changed
to its
current name on 16 December 1993.  The purpose for the incorporation of the
plaintiff and the change of name was that various
developers, principals and
contractors with whom SJP Aust was negotiating for contracts took exception to
entering into a contract
for construction works with a company acting as
trustee.  The plaintiff commenced a project at the Prince of Wales Hospital in
January
or February 1995 and sub-contracted its staff from SJP Aust, not
employing any workers itself; and at this time SJP Aust was experiencing
a
considerable downturn in its work.  In January 1996, the plaintiff started work
on the IMAX Theatre at Darling Harbour and in relation
to that building it
directly employed its own workers.  
<P>

7   	The issued shares in the plaintiff are held by Tony
Pejkovic and John Pejkovic (brothers), who were originally the directors,
but
at the time of change of name they resigned and their parents Steven and Lydia
Pejkovic became directors.  Both companies had
the same registered office, same
business address and the same telephone number, and both companies hired
equipment from another
company owned by the Pejkovic family interests, namely
CSPR Pty Limited.  An examination of the employees of the two companies showed
that of the 36 employees of SJP Aust in its last payroll period of significant
operations, being the week ended 13 December 1995,
31 of such employees were
employed by the plaintiff in the year ended 30 June 1996; and of the 119
employees of the plaintiff for
the year ended 30 June 1996, 52 thereof were
previously employed by SJP Aust within the period 1 July 1995 to 13 December
1995.
<P>

8   	All directors and members of the plaintiff and SJP Aust
were from the same immediate family, and all key positions in the plaintiff
were filled by staff who held similar positions with SJP Aust, although some
middle management positions were not transferred from
SJP Aust to the
plaintiff.  The plaintiff voluntarily made payments to employees of SJP Aust
relating to their leave entitlements
following the appointment of a receiver of
that company.
<P>

9   	In making his Determination, the Delegate also found (p 17
of Determination) that both companies carried out similar work in
the same
market, the company names were similar and the name "SJP Formwork" was widely
known in the market and of value in obtaining
contracts.  He concluded that
from the perspectives of both companies (and for that matter from most external
perspectives) the two
companies were essentially represented as the same
business.  He noted that the report of the administrator of SJP Aust to
creditors
dated 3 July 1996 indicates that tangible assets of the company were
restricted to plant and equipment with an estimated value of
$25,000, but he
considered that the prime asset of that company was its name, the goodwill
associated with that name and the expertise
of its skilled staff.
<P>

10   	He held that <i>"acquired"</i> as used in the Order was a
wider term than transfer, sale or purchase and meant "to gain by any means, to
come to have"; and that
<i>"business"</i> included "commercial activity engaged
in for gain or livelihood".  He therefore held that the formwork business
operations of SJP
Aust had been acquired by the plaintiff and that the premium
payable by the plaintiff was to be experience adjusted, based on the
claims and
wages history of SJP Aust, and that for premium calculation purposes as at 30
June 1997 and 1998 respectively, the experience
adjusted premiums utilised by
the Insurer were correct as issued.  
<P>

11   	The grounds on which the determination of an
administrative tribunal can be reviewed by the courts are very limited.  Apart
from cases of jurisdictional error or denial of natural justice, such decisions
can only be reviewed if there has been an error of
law, which includes taking
into account irrelevant matters or failing to take into account relevant ones.
As Gibbs J said in <b><i>Buck v Bavone</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20135%20CLR%20110" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 135 CLR 110</a> at
118-119:
<P>

"It is not uncommon for statutes to provide that a board or other authority
shall or may take certain action if it is satisfied
of the existence of certain
matters specified in the statute.  Whether the decision of the authority under
such a statute can be
effectively reviewed by the courts will often largely
depend on the nature of the matters of which the authority is required to be
satisfied.  In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot
act merely arbitrarily or capriciously.  Moreover,
a person affected will
obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected
itself in law or that it has
failed to consider matters that it was required to
consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account.  Even if none of these
things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by
the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable
authority could
properly have arrived at it."

<P>

12   	Although the meaning of words in a statute or statutory
instrument used in their common understanding or with no special or
technical
meaning is a question of fact, the question whether the facts found by the
tribunal come within the meaning of words and
expressions in such statute or
statutory instrument is a question of law:  <b><i>Hope v Bathurst City
Council</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144 CLR 1</a>, <b><i>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

<P>

13   	It was agreed between the parties that the words
"<i>acquire"</i> and<i> "business"</i> in the Order are used in their ordinary
colloquial and not in any technical sense, and that the meaning of an ordinary
English word
is generally regarded as a question of fact and not as a matter of
law.  However, as the authorities referred to above indicate,
the real issue is
whether the facts found by the Delegate came within the ordinary meaning of
those expressions.  This is the question
of law.
<P>

14   	On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that the
Delegate erred in law in his construction of the phrase <i>"acquire the
business"</i>, took irrelevant matters into account, and failed to take into
account relevant matters in reaching his determination. 
<P>

15   	The term <i>"to acquire"</i> was defined by the Court in
<b><i>Allina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2028%20FCR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 28 FCR 203</a>
at 209:
<P>

"The verb "to acquire", according to its ordinary and natural meaning, connotes
in our view to obtain, gain or get something.  The
first meaning given in the
<i>Oxford English Dictionary </i>(2nd ed, 1989), is:
<P>

"1.  To gain, obtain or get as one's own, to gain the ownership of (by one's
own exertions or qualities)."
<P>

The second meaning is:
<P>

"2.  To receive, or get as one's own (without reference to the manner), to come
into possession of."
<P>

The <i>Macquarie Dictionary</i> gives a similar definition.  There must be
something in existence that can be obtained or gained . . ."
<P>

and later (at 211) the Court quoted with approval what was said by Cohen LJ in
<b><i>Congreve v Inland Revenue Commissioners </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%201%20All%20ER%20168" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] 1 All ER 168</a> at
173:
<P>

" . . . as used by lawyers the work "acquired" has long covered transactions of
a purely passive nature and means little more than
receiving.  Indeed that is
the second ordinary meaning given in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary".
<P>

16   	The ordinary meaning of <i>"business"</i> is a commercial
enterprise carried on for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive
basis:  <b><i>Hope v Bathurst City Council </i></b>at 8-9, which is not
inconsistent with the Delegate's description "commercial activity engaged in
for gain or livelihood."  It means
its undertaking, its management, workers,
equipment, business expertise, experience, procedures and goodwill (which in
turn includes
its reputation, location, telephone number and, particularly in
the type of business here involved, its personal contacts).
<P>

17   	If a business (formwork, concreting, etc) is carried on by
a company with a name known in the trade, and the principals of
that company
form another company with a very similar name (SJP Formwork (Aust) / SJP
Formwork (NSW)) which one may reasonably infer
will be identified in the trade
as having the same principals, competency, expertise and business practices,
and either promptly
or over a period of time, the first company ceases to carry
on its business, and the second company starts to carry on business of
the same
nature, from the same premises, with the same telephone number, using the same
management team, and to a large extent the
same workers, and employing the same
business practices, working for the same or similar customers acquired through
the same or similar
contacts, the second company may fairly be said to have
<i>"acquired"</i> the business of the first company.  This is even more so when
it hires equipment from the same hire company which is closely related
by
shareholding and directors to both the other companies and operates out of the
same premises.
<P>

18   	Such a result is consistent with the purposive
construction of acts and statutory rules directed by the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation
Act 1987</a></i></b>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a>, and see <b><i>Saraswati v The Queen </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172
CLR 1</a> at 21.  Workers compensation premiums are traditionally assessed on the
number of employees and claims history because these are
the factors most
likely, so far as human ingenuity can assess, to predict the level of future
claims and therefore the level of future
payouts and need for premium income.
Therefore, if the second entity is doing the same type of work for the same
type of clients
and has substantially the same employees or a substantial
proportion of the employees of the previous entity and the same management
team, who are responsible inter alia for safety procedures, then the former
entity is in a very real sense for the purposes of assessing
premiums the
<i>"predecessor"</i> of the later entity.
<P>

19   	Mr Rayment QC on behalf of the plaintiff submitted that
there needed to be some identifiable transaction which passed the
business from
the alleged predecessor company to the plaintiff, that a distinction was to be
drawn between acquiring a business and
succeeding to the trade of another
entity, that there must be something identifiable as the business of the first
employer which
was subsequently, but not prior to the acquisition, enjoyed by
or owned by the second employer and that for the provisions of the
Order to
apply, acquisition must be complete by an identifiable date which must be the
cut-off date in that there cannot be a period
when the wages and claims
experience of the two companies overlap.
<P>

20   	In my opinion, none of these submissions are valid.  There
is nothing in the meaning of <i>"acquire the business"</i> which requires an
identifiable transaction and I can see no difference between acquiring a
business and succeeding to the trade of
another business.  In many cases the
second entity will succeed to the trade of another by purchasing the latter's
business, but
this is not necessarily so.  An example was proffered of a
country town with two hotels where one closes down (e.g. where the licence
is
removed to the city).  Whether one talks of the remaining hotel acquiring the
business, or succeeding to the trade of the closed
hotel, the effect is the
same; most, if not all, of the customers of the closed hotel will take their
custom to the remaining one,
and it can, I believe, fairly be said to have
acquired the business of the former.
<P>

21   	Reference was made to the duties of the liquidator of SJP
Aust to ascertain whether a proper price had been paid by the plaintiff
for the
business and particularly for the goodwill, and <b><i>Commissioner of Taxation
v Murry </i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] HCA 42</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20155%20ALR%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 155 ALR 67</a> was referred to.  But this
ignores the reality of the nature of the business and goodwill involved.  The
business was not acquired
by the plaintiff by the assignment of any existing
contracts and a transfer of workers but, having regard to the nature of the
business
involved, by a gradual running down of one business and building up of
another.  The business was a succession of sub-contract jobs
on building sites
and the plaintiff acquired the business by the process of SJP Aust ceasing to
tender for and obtain fresh contracts
and the plaintiff doing so instead;
similarly (except for the overlapping period when the plaintiff hired workers
from SJP Aust)
the workers employed by SJP Aust ceased to be employed by that
company as its projects came to an end and they were subsequently
freshly
engaged by the plaintiff as its projects got started and its need for staff
grew.
<P>

22   	The acquisition was a gradual process and I can see
nothing in the Order which excludes from its terms such a gradual process;
and
it follows that although it is necessary for there to be something
indentifiable as the business of the first employer which
is subsequently
enjoyed or owned by the second employer, it is not necessary for there to be an
identifiable date after, but not
before, which the total enjoyment or ownership
of the whole of the business passes from one employer to another.
<P>

23   	Finally it was submitted that there could not be a gradual
or overlapping transfer period because prior to the date which
needs to be
identified as the date of acquisition, the wages and claims experience to be
taken into account must be those of the
first employer, and after that date the
relevant wages and claims experience must be those of the second employer,
which may or may
not exist prior to the relevant date; and it was submitted
that it was not permissible to amalgamate the post acquisition wages and
claims
experience of the former employer with those of the later employer.  This may
be so, but it is because after the relevant
business of the former is acquired
(whether it be the whole or main part of the business or of a separate and
distinct business)
it no longer has any wages and claims experience of that
business; that is, in the case of a gradual acquisition, after the completion
of the acquisition.  Both schedule 4 cl 3 and schedule 5 cl 1(3) use the word
"includes", and there is no reason why in the case
of a gradual acquisition
there cannot be an overlapping period during which the wages and claims
experience of both the former and
the later employers are taken into account.
It is not correct to say, and the Delegate did not say, that the plaintiff
acquired the
business of SJP Aust in January 1995 when it commenced work on the
Prince of Wales Hospital; at that time and until January 1996
the plaintiff did
not directly employ its own workers whereas SJP Aust did not retrench its staff
until December 1995 and went into
liquidation on 10 July 1996.  What was in
issue in the Delegate's Determination was the appropriate premiums payable for
the years
1996/97 and 1997/98, and on any view of the facts the acquisition of
the business by the plaintiff was complete by 30 June 1996.
<P>

24   	For these reasons I am not satisfied that the Delegate
misdirected himself in law, that he failed to take into account any
relevant
considerations or took into account any irrelevant ones; and accordingly I
direct the entry of judgment for the defendant
and order the plaintiff to pay
the defendant's costs of the proceedings.
