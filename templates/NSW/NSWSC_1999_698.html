<i>Friday, 9 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1890/99	ROYAL CAPITAL PTY LIMITED   -v-   NECE PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   By summons filed on 1 April 1999, the
plaintiff, Royal Capital Pty Limited ("Royal Capital), seeks an order that the
creditor's
statutory demand for payment of debt dated 16 March 1999 issued on
behalf of the defendant, Nece Pty Limited ("Nece"), be set aside
pursuant to
the provisions of section 459H(1)(a) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2   	That demand seeks payment by the plaintiff to the defendant
of the amount of $400,000.  That amount is described in the schedule
to the
demand as follows:  "principal outstanding pursuant to loan agreement".
<P>

3   	In terms of the summons, the plaintiff brings the present
proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 459H(1)(a) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>.  That subsection provides, relevantly:
<P>

This section applies where, on an application under section 459G, the court is
satisfied of either or both of the following:
<P>

(a)	that there is a genuine dispute between the company and the respondent
about the existence or amount of a debt to which the
demand relates ...
<P>

4   	In the instant case the plaintiff asserts that there is a
genuine dispute as to the existence of the debt asserted by the defendant,
that
is, the debt alleged to be constituted by the outstanding principal pursuant to
a loan agreement.
<P>

5   	In support of the summons, there was filed an affidavit of
Dr Adrian Ong sworn 30 March 1999.  He is a director, and also a
shareholder,
of the plaintiff company and appears to be the person who is essentially in
control of the plaintiff.
<P>

6   	I should also here record that Dr Ong is a director of the
defendant company.  He became such in 1997.  In the affidavit to
which I have
just referred Dr Ong makes reference to the loan agreement which is the subject
of paragraph 3 of the affidavit verifying
the statutory demand.  That affidavit
verifying is sworn by Phillip Graham Sidney on 16 March 1999. In paragraph 3 of
that verifying
affidavit, the deponent asserts that the plaintiff is party to a
loan agreement with the defendant dated 19 August 1997.
<P>

7   	Dr Ong, in paragraph 5 of his affidavit, says that the
purported "loan agreement" referred to in Mr Phillip Sidney's affidavit
is
contained in a letter from Phillip Sidney on behalf of Nece to Royal Capital of
19 August 1997, and Dr Ong annexes a copy of that
letter to his affidavit.
<P>

8   	He continues in paragraph 6 by saying:
<P>

There has never been any agreement by Royal Capital in respect to any repayment
and that there never will be.  The document is and
was a "dummy" document and
does not evidence a true or real transaction.  No amount of $400,000 has been
paid by Nece to Royal Capital.
<P>

9   	Subsequently, there was filed in the proceedings an
affidavit by Mr Sidney of 28 May 1999.  That affidavit annexes a copy of
the
document which Dr Ong annexed to his affidavit and which Dr Ong described as
the purported loan agreement.  However, the annexure
to Mr Sidney's affidavit
is slightly different, in that it bears an endorsement which does not appear on
the annexure to Dr Ong's
affidavit.
<P>

10   	It is appropriate that I should set forth what is
contained in that letter, since that letter is relied upon by the defendant
as
constituting the loan agreement giving rise to the indebtedness, which is the
subject of the present proceedings.  The letter
is addressed:  
<P>

Royal Capital Pty Limited
<P>

537 Malvern Road
<P>

TOORAK  VICTORIA  AUSTRALIA  3142
<P>

11   	It says:
<P>

Attention Dr Adrian Ong
<P>

Dear Adrian,
<P>

NECE PTY LIMITED ADVANCE TO ROYAL CAPITAL
<P>

I confirm that Nece has advanced to Royal Capital Pty Limited (Royal) (formerly
known as Haynick Pty Limited) $400,000 (<b>Advance</b>) on the following
terms:
<P>

(a)	Interest on the Advance is payable at such rate and such time as agreed by
Nece and Royal; and
<P>

(b)	the Advance is to be repaid by Royal to Nece in instalments to be agreed
between Royal and Nece.
<P>

Please acknowledge agreement to these terms by signing and returning to me the
copy of this letter which is enclosed.
<P>

Yours faithfully
<P>

Phillip Sidney.
<P>

12   	The copy of the letter annexed to Mr Sidney's affidavit
bears the following endorsement:
<P>

Acknowledged by Adrian Ong on behalf of Royal Capital Pty Limited
<P>

and then bears a signature, which appears to be "Adrian Ong".  Dr Ong was
cross-examined concerning that endorsement, and ultimately
his response was
that he did not dispute that that document, being Annexure "F" to Mr Sidney's
affidavit, bears Dr Ong's signature.

<P>

13   	Dr Ong swore a second affidavit in the proceedings on 16
June 1999.  That affidavit was essentially in response to Mr Sidney's
affidavit
of 28 May 1999.  Paragraph 6 dealt with the letter of 19 August 1997 bearing
the endorsement which I have just recorded.
 Although in paragraph 6 Dr Ong
said that he had no clear recollection of signing the letter, he then referred
to signing a letter
as requested by Mr Sidney and said that that letter may
have been Annexure "F" to Mr Sidney's affidavit.
<P>

14   	He continued:
<P>

I did not see the letter as a genuine record of the dealings between Royal
Capital and Nece.
<P>

15   	He also said in that paragraph:
<P>

I was under the impression that it was a letter required for the internal
records of Nece only.  In signing the letter I had no
intention of binding
Royal Capital.  I did not see the letter as a legally binding document as all
matters between Royal Capital
and Nece had already been agreed upon before that
time.
<P>

16   	Essentially it is asserted by Dr Ong, on behalf of the
plaintiff, that the letter of 19 August 1997 was, in effect, a sham;
that it
did not record anything which had happened.  An attempted explanation for such
a sham has been advanced by Dr Ong on behalf
of the plaintiff, as follows.
<P>

17   	It would appear that Nece was in a degree of financial
difficulty at the relevant time in 1997.  In order to resolve that
financial
difficulty, Nece was desirous of purchasing from a company, Ritek Corporation,
shares which that company held in Nece itself.
 It could not do that directly,
but, as it would appear, it attempted and, in fact, succeeded in doing so in a
quite legal fashion,
as a result of the intervention in the transaction, of the
present plaintiff, Royal Capital Pty Limited.
<P>

18   	The minutes of a meeting of directors of Nece of 25 July
1997 record an oral agreement reached between Mr Sidney, on behalf
of Nece, and
Royal Capital (which at that time had the name Haynick Pty Limited).  It will,
however, be appreciated that Dr Ong was
not, at the date of that directors'
meeting, a director of Nece.  He became a director subsequently.
<P>

19   	The advance by Nece to the plaintiff was, however, duly
recorded in the financial statements of Nece for the period ended
31 December
1997.  At the time when those financial statements were prepared and were
available, Dr Ong was a director of Nece.
<P>

20   	There is in evidence, as Exhibit 1, a document entitled
Deed of Settlement and Share Purchase relating to Nece Pty Limited.
 That deed
was made on 22 July 1997.  It contemplates the purchase by the plaintiff from
Ritek, of shares in Nece for $400,000. 
Dr Ong agreed that those shares were
the same shares which are referred to in paragraph 4 of his affidavit of 16
June 1999, and he
agreed that the share transaction contemplated by the deed
was ultimately brought to completion.
<P>

21   	The deed provided for Nece to lend money to the plaintiff,
the purchase price of those shares, and there is no dispute by
the plaintiff
that it did obtain from Ritek, in accordance with that deed, the shares in
Nece.
<P>

22   	I have already observed that the plaintiff brings the
present proceedings pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1) of
section
459H of the <i>Corporations Law</i> and upon the sole basis that there is a
genuine dispute as to the existence of the debt.  The basis of that assertion
is that the
entire transaction, and in particular the letter of 19 August 1997
setting forth the details of the advance by the defendant to the
plaintiff of
the sum of $400,000, was a sham.
<P>

23   	It is concomitant with that assertion by Dr Ong, on behalf
of the plaintiff, that he, a director of the plaintiff and also
a director of
the defendant, was prepared to be a party to such a sham.  I am not satisfied
that the transaction was in any way a
sham.  Whatever dispute might now be
asserted, I do not regard  that as being in any way a genuine dispute.
<P>

24   	The defendant gave notice by letter dated 3 December 1998
that it required repayment of the $400,000 within 28 days of the
date of that
letter.  I am satisfied that the debt thereupon became due and payable by the
plaintiff to the defendant and, there
being no basis for any genuine dispute as
to its indebtedness, I propose to dismiss the summons.
<P>

25   	DISCUSSION ENSUED AS TO COSTS.
<P>

26   	<b>MASTER</b>:  I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.
<P>

3.	I make no order in respect to the costs of the notice of motion filed by the
defendant on 2 July 1999 to the intent that each
party will bear its own costs
thereof.
<P>

The Exhibits may be returned.
<P>
