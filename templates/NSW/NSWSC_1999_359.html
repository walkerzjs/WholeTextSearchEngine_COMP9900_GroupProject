<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - difference in substance)</b>
<P>

1	By a Statement of Claim filed on 6 November 1998 the plaintiff sues the first
defendant as the editor of the bi-monthly magazine
entitled "<i>Polare</i>' and
the second defendant by reason of the New South Wales Health Department, so it
is alleged, being the publisher of that journal.
 The particular article sued
upon is Exhibit A, the whole journal tendered by the plaintiff is Exhibit 1:
it provides a context.
<P>

2	The article sued upon is comprised of two parts, a letter to the editor which
is the following terms:
<P>

	<i>"Dear Editor,</i>
<P>

<i>	I am transgendered and a mother, but unfortunately I have, for all
practical purposes been bed ridden after SRS corrective surgery
was carried out
by Dr Peter Haertsch two years ago.</i>
<P>

<i>	My 17 year old daughter Tracey was required to do an essay for a School
English assignment.  It was to be about changes and effects
on her life and
this is her essay.</i>
<P>

<i>	I am sending it in as written.  I think it is self-explanatory if the above
is known.</i>
<P>

<i>	Rachael".</i>
<P>

3	The second component is entitled "<i>The Lonely Haunting Cry...</i>" being
the essay referred to in the communication with the editor.  The essay fairly
acknowledged by the defendant to be a moving
composition is, on any fair
reading, an integral part of the publication as a whole sued upon.
<P>

4	The plaintiff alleges that the matter complained of conveys the following
defamatory imputations:
<P>

	<i>"4(a)	that the plaintiff was so grossly negligent in carrying out sexual
reconstruction surgery on the patient Rachel </i>(sic) <i>that he caused her
ongoing intolerable pain;</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	that the plaintiff was so grossly negligent in carry out </i>(sic)
<i>sexual reconstruction surgery on the patient Rachel</i> (sic)<i> that he
destroyed her quality of life;</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	that the plaintiff was so grossly negligent in carrying out sexual
reconstruction surgery on the patient Rachel </i>(sic) <i>that he caused her to
be bedridden for life;</i>
<P>

	<i>(d)	that the plaintiff was so grossly incompetent in carrying out sexual
reconstruction surgery on the patient Rachel </i>(sic)<i> that he caused her
ongoing intolerable pain;</i>
<P>

	<i>(e)	that the plaintiff was so grossly incompetent in carrying out sexual
reconstruction surgery on the patient Rachel</i> (sic)<i> that he destroyed her
quality of life;</i>
<P>

	<i>(f)	that the plaintiff was so grossly incompetent in carrying out sexual
reconstruction surgery on the patient Rachel </i>(sic) <i>that he caused her to
be bedridden for life".</i>
<P>

5	The first objection taken to the imputations is that they do not differ in
substance.  Mr Lynch was good enough to remind me of
the decision of Hunt J in
<b><i>Matheson v Kennedy &amp; Anor</i></b> (unreported, 3 November 1989) where
his Honour was concerned with a similar question as to the distinction, if any,
between incompetence
and negligence.  His Honour found that there was but, in
effect, "<i>only just</i>".  I am of the same view and this basis for dealing
with the matter does not succeed.
<P>

6	It is next contended the matter sued upon is incapable of conveying the
imputations pleaded.  
<P>

7	It is argued that the availability of the pleaded imputations depends upon
the proscribed "<i>inference upon inference"</i> drawing most recently reviewed
by Hunt CJ at CL in <b><i>Amalgamated Television Services Limited v
Marsden</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 158</a> at 167.  Indeed, it is suggested that there
are three inferences involved here.  The first inference is that the person
Rachael became
bedridden because of, or as a result of, surgery performed by
the plaintiff.  The second is that the surgery which he did perform
was
performed negligently or incompetently.  The third inference is that because of
the negligent or incompetent performance of the
surgery the complainant was
caused to suffer ongoing intolerable pain because of the plaintiff's negligent
surgery, thereby the complainant's
quality of life was "<i>destroyed</i>" not
diminished, not damaged, but destroyed completely, rather than just for two
years as is referred to in the matter complained
of.
<P>

8	It is next argued that in any event, the ordinary reasonable reader would
understand surgery not to be risk free, particularly
"<i>serious</i>' surgery,
and that sometimes the procedure can have an unfortunate outcome which leaves a
person with disability.  Further, there
is a problem, it is contended, in that
the matter complained of contains the letters "<i>SRS"</i> which would be
meaningless to the ordinary reasonable reader they being an abbreviation for
sexual reconstruction surgery.
<P>

9	I have given the submissions by Mr Lynch for the second defendant, which were
supported by Mr Andronos for the first defendant,
serious consideration.
<P>

10	There are two critical components of the whole of the matter complained of:
first, the reference to the surgery carried out by
the plaintiff and second,
the statement in the last sentence "<i>if the above is known</i>" which
embraces the highly emotive component of the daughter's essay.
<P>

11	I am not persuaded at all that the ordinary reasonable reader would have to
go through the proscribed ratiocination in drawing
the three inferences
referred to.  I am persuaded however by the statement by Mr Lynch that these
imputations are "<i>pitched</i>" very high.  They most certainly are.  They
arguably represent however, for the purposes of the present application, in my
view,
no more than the drawing in the case of each imputation of an inference
from what is either expressly stated in the matter complained
of or implicit in
it, particularly the fact of the surgery, the fact that it was corrective
surgery, the fact that it was carried
out by the plaintiff two years ago and
the fact that for all practical purposes the plaintiff has been bedridden.
Whether the inferences
(if they be inferences) represented by the imputations
are available to the high level pitched in each of the causes of action, in
my
view, should be a matter for the jury.
<P>

12	Nothing, in my view, turns upon any question of ignorance of "<i>SRS</i>";
arguably its omission would make no difference to the substance of the
plaintiff's complaint.
<P>

13	This is one of those cases, in my view, which is an "<i>all or nothing</i>"
case.  The perils in pleading imputations pitched so high are clear and I am
not persuaded that the matter complained of is incapable
of conveying them
bearing in mind the general principle of reasonableness, referred to in
<b><i>Marsden</i></b> and the approach referred to in <b><i>Jones v
Skelton</i></b> (1963) 63 (Supra) (NSW) 644 and <b><i>Lewis v The Daily
Telegraph</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 234.</a>  
<P>

14	This is pre-eminently a case for the jury and the parties should turn their
mind as to whether there exists a mechanism to be
availed of with some
promptitude for the determination of the question of fact as to whether or not
the imputations are conveyed.
<P>

15	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 4(a) - (f) inclusive shall go to the jury.
<P>

2.	The defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

3.	The parties have liberty to file, by consent, orders and directions for the
further conduct of the matter in the Defamation List,
within 14 days.
<P>

4.	At the expiry of 14 days, liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3
days notice.
