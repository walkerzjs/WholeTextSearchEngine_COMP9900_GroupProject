<b><u>070062/98 - REGINA v Soo Duck JANG</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  On Monday 18 October 1999 the prisoner,
Soo Duck Jang, was arraigned before me on an indictment charging him with two
counts of
murder.  He pleaded not guilty in respect of each count and a jury
was duly empanelled.  The matter was stood over to Tuesday 19
October to permit
Mr Dhanji to confer with the prisoner.  Mr Dhanji had come into the matter late
and had difficulties arranging
for a conference with the prisoner who is in
custody.
<P>

2   	At the commencement of proceedings on 19 October 1999 the
accused sought to be re-arraigned.  He entered pleas of guilty in
respect of
each count. I accepted those pleas pursuant to s 399A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b>
1900.  The jury was discharged without giving a verdict and convictions were
recorded upon the pleas of guilty.  I embarked on hearing
submissions
concerning the admissibility of evidence which the Crown seeks to lead at the
sentence hearing.  
<P>

3   	On 28 September 1999 the Crown served a Notice pursuant to
s 67 of the <b>Evidence Act (NSW)</b> 1995 on the prisoner's former solicitors.
The Notice particularised paragraphs in the statements of fourteen witnesses
setting out
previous representations made by the deceased, In Ja Yoo and Min
Kyoung Kang, which the Crown advised it proposed to lead pursuant
to the
provisions of s 65(2)(b) and (c) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.  
<P>

4   	At the commencement of the sentence hearing the Crown
Prosecutor stated that he did not intend to lead all the material the
subject
of the 
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a> Notice.  However, it was proposed to lead evidence to establish that on
occasions prior to 8 April 1998 In Ja Yoo had complained
that the prisoner, in
connection with the progress of his immigration application, had threatened to
kill her and her children. 
<P>

5   	Mr Dhanji objected to the admission of material of this
character.  He invited me to make a direction pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(2)</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> that the law of evidence in relation to the proof of
representations made by In Ja Yoo and Min Kyoung Kang apply in the sentence
proceedings.  
<P>

6   	Briefly, the Crown case is that the prisoner went to the
home of his estranged wife, In Ja Yoo, on 8 April 1998 to apply pressure
to her
in connection with an application he then had pending with the Department of
Immigration.  It was necessary for In Ja Yoo
to sign a document.  The prisoner
armed himself with a knife before going to the premises on this occasion.  He
quarrelled with In
Ja Yoo inside the premises and repeatedly stabbed her and
her adult daughter, Min Kyoung Kang.  
<P>

7   	The Crown contends that I should sentence the prisoner upon
the basis that these killings were not the result of an isolated
outburst of
rage but rather that the prisoner had been insistently pressing demands
concerning his immigration application and placing
In Ja Yoo in fear in
connection with the same.  
<P>

8   	The background of threats made by the prisoner to the
deceased, In Ja Yoo, is not admitted by the prisoner.  I consider this
material
is relevant and that, if it is admitted, it will be significant in determining
the sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner.
I direct that in relation to the
whole of the material the subject of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a> Notice of 28 September 1999 upon
which the Crown now relies the law of evidence applies.
<P>

9   	The Crown seeks to lead evidence contained in paragraph 7
of the statement of Sung Hee Jun, dated 8 April 1998, as to representations
made by In Ja Yoo to social workers at the Concord Psychiatric Hospital.
Associated with this material the Crown also seeks to rely
on paragraphs 11 and
12 of the statement of Dr John Perica dated 17 April 1998 together with various
representations contained in
hospital records which are annexed thereto and the
statement of Robyn Anne Collins dated 17 April 1998 together with Ms Collins'
notes of discussions with In Ja Yoo.  Ms Collins is a social worker who had
dealings with In Ja Yoo during her admission to the Concord
Psychiatric
Hospital in March and April 1998.  I reject the whole of this material.
Broadly, the material contains accounts that
In Ja Yoo complained to Ms Collins
and other staff at the Concord Hospital that the prisoner made threats both to
her and to her
children. The threats were said to have been made in connection
with the prisoner's immigration application.  
<P>

10   	It appears that In Ja Yoo was admitted to the Concord
Hospital on 18 March 1998.  She remained a patient at that hospital
until
shortly before her killing on 8 April 1998.  It is sufficient for present
purposes to note that the threats referred to in
this body of material were not
sufficiently particularised to enable me to determine when it was they were
made.  Accordingly, it
is not possible to determine for the purposes of 
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> whether In Ja Yoo's representations were made "shortly after" the
making of them.  Accordingly, I am of the view that the evidence
is not
admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b).</a>  The Crown submits that the material is
nonetheless admissible pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(c).</a>  That subsection requires
consideration of whether the representation was made in circumstances which
make it highly probable that
it was reliable.  
<P>

11   	I have regard to the decision of Sperling J in <b>R v
Mankotia</b>, unreported 27 July 1998, as to the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(c)</a> of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.  His Honour was of the view that `the circumstances'
to which both subsections (b) and (c) are directed refer to the circumstances
in which the representation was made in the sense of its factual setting at
that time.  The effect of this construction is to exclude
from consideration
events subsequent to the representation being made together with other
representations made by the same person
on other occasions.  His Honour noted
that this approach differs from that which Hunt CJ at CL appears to have taken
in <b>R v Lock </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2091%20A%20Crim%20R%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 91 A Crim R 356</a> at 360. I note that in <b>Lock</b>,
Hunt CJ at CL was not invited to give specific attention to the construction to
be placed on the words "made in the circumstances"
for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)</a>
(b) and (c).  I respectfully favour the approach taken by Sperling J in
<b>Mankotia</b>.  Applying this test, I do not consider that the
representations made by In Ja Yoo to social workers and other staff at the
Concord
Psychiatric Hospital during her stay were made in circumstances which
makes it highly probable that they were reliable.  It seems
to me that, from
time to time, people make false accusations to counsellors and people in
authority in the context of matrimonial
disputes.  If one puts to one side the
circumstance that the fears of which In Ja Yoo spoke to the social worker and
others were
realised, as it seems to me I must do, I see nothing about the fact
of the making of the representations which would confer on them
the high
probability of reliability which the section requires.  
<P>

12   	For the same reasons I reject the evidence of a note said
to have been written by In Ja Yoo and signed by her on 25 March
1998 which is
an annexure to the statement of the Immigration Compliance Officer, Mark
Fitzpatrick, dated 16 April 1998.  
<P>

13   	The Crown seeks to lead evidence from Sun Kyung Kang
contained in paragraphs 36 and 37 of a statement made on 9 April 1998.
 This,
too, is the subject of objection.  Ms Kang is the daughter of the deceased, In
Ja Yoo.  At the date of making the statement
she was aged 24 years.  She was a
married woman living with her husband and his family. Ms Kang says that she
visited her mother
at the Concord Psychiatric Hospital following the latter's
admission on 18 March 1998 after taking an overdose of pills.  In the
course of
the visit In Ja Yoo gave an account of the circumstances preceding her suicide
attempt.  She also said that the prisoner
had been visiting her in hospital and
making threats in connection with his permanent residency papers. In particular
In Ja Yoo said
that the prisoner threatened that if she did not sign the papers
he was going to kill everyone.  
<P>

14   	The Crown also seeks to lead evidence from the deceased,
In Ja Yoo's, son, Dae Sung Kang, about an occasion when he visited
her at
Concord Hospital following her suicide attempt.  In his statement made on 8
April 1998 in paragraph 16 he asserts that the
deceased said of the prisoner,
"He threatened me by saying that if I wasn't going to sign his permanent
resident paper he would kill
us".  At the date of making the statement, Dae
Sung Kang was aged 30 years.  He was a married man with an infant child.  
<P>

15   	I propose to admit the evidence of both Sun Kyung Kang and
Dae Sung Kang as to the representations made to them by the deceased.
 I
consider that this material is admissible pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(c).</a>  I have
regard to the circumstances that in each case In Ja Yoo was in hospital
following a suicide attempt when she made the representations.
They were
addressed to her adult son and daughter. Neither of those persons was related
to the prisoner. Mr Dhanji submits that there
is nothing about these
circumstances to satisfy the test of high probability of reliability required
by the subsection.  In this
regard he submits that the deceased may have wished
to justify her intention to separate from her husband by making allegations of
this kind.  I consider that suggestion somewhat fanciful.  Adult children would
naturally be concerned for their mother's well-being
on learning that she had
been admitted to hospital following a suicide attempt.  I consider it highly
probable that In Ja Yoo would
not have wrongly asserted that she had been the
subject of threats in the course of private conversations with her children in
these
circumstances.  A threat of the character she described is not likely to
be forgotten.  
<P>

16   	The Crown also seeks to lead evidence from Ha Yu Kim in
conformity with paragraph 8 of a statement made by her on 16 April
1998.  Ms
Kim was a neighbour of the deceased, In Ja Yoo.  She had been in the habit of
visiting In Ja Yoo on a daily basis and having
coffee and chatting with her.
She described her relationship with In Ja Yoo as "fairly close".  Paragraph 8
contains an account of
representations made by In Ja Yoo on the day of her
admission to the Concord Hospital prior to the suicide attempt.  Briefly, In
Ja
Yoo called to Ha Yu Kim's home holding her stomach, apparently in pain and
crying.  She appeared unable to speak for about three
minutes.  After that time
she gave Ha Yu Kim an account of having quarrelled with the prisoner who had
punched her in the stomach
and, among other things, said, "If you don't sign
and co-operate with me I will kill all of your kids".  I propose to allow that
evidence to be led by the Crown.  In my view, it meets the tests required  both
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> and (c).  As to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a>, I note the observations made by
Sperling J in <b>Mankotia</b> as to the meaning to be given to the words
"shortly after".  I adopt his Honour's observation that those words:
<P>

"... imply that a normative judgment is to be made dependent on the
circumstances of the case.  ...  The predominant factor in the
phrase `shortly
after' must be the actual time that has elapsed and whether that fits the
ordinary usage of the expression `shortly
after' in the circumstances of the
case.  The judgment should, however, be influenced by the policy behind the
provision.  That is
to put a brake on evidence being given of a recollection
which may have faded in its accuracy with the passage of time."
<P>

17   	The assertion contained in paragraph 8 of the statement of
Ha Yu Kim is one made within minutes of the incident between the
deceased and
the prisoner in which it is said the threats were made.  It appears that In Ja
Yoo, whilst still suffering the effects
of the punch to the stomach, walked to
her neighbour's house and, as soon as she was physically able to make a report,
did so.  I
consider that those circumstances make it unlikely that the
representation was a fabrication.  If I were not of that view I would
nonetheless admit it pursuant to subsection (c) having regard to the nature of
the relationship between the deceased and her neighbour.
