<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s104.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 104(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>, </i>the
Director of Public Prosecutions appeals an order made by a magistrate, Ms
Gilmour, in the Children's Court at Glebe, dismissing
an information against
the defendant.  Such an appeal lies on a question of law only.
<P>

2   	The information charged the defendant with an offence under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 99</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></i>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 99</a> is in the following terms:
<P>

"Whosoever, with menaces, or by force, demands any money from any person, with
intent to steal the same, shall be liable to penal
servitude for ten years."
<P>

3   	The prosecution case was essentially given in the evidence
of the alleged victim, Raymond Macchi. His evidence can be summarised
in the
following way.  He was sixteen years of age at the time of the events he
described. At about 10.30 am on 2 February 1999 while
waiting at a bus stop he
saw the defendant, whom he knew from primary school, with another male.  Mr
Macchi boarded a bus and took
a seat at the rear.  The defendant and his
companion followed and took the seats just in front of him, and the defendant
and Mr Macchi
greeted one another.  Nobody else was in the near vicinity but a
few passengers were towards the front.  The other male drew attention
to a
mobile phone Mr Macchi was carrying and asked to see it.  Mr Macchi agreed and
handed him the phone.  The male asked how much
it had cost and then said "Well
you don't have to worry about it now, its mine".  He pocketed the phone.  The
defendant was seated
nearby, looking at the other person. 
<P>

4   	Mr Macchi asked for the phone to be returned and said that
he needed it for work.  His request was refused.  He said that he
would do
anything to get the phone back because he needed it for work.  The male asked
how much money he had on him and Mr Macchi
replied that he had about $15.  The
male said it would cost more than that and asked if Mr Macchi had any more
money.  Mr Macchi
said he might have about $50 in the bank.  He again asked if
there was any way he could get the phone back.  The male said that he
could
have the phone back if Mr Macchi gave him the $50.  The whole conversation was
conducted with the defendant's companion.  The
defendant sat nearby but said
nothing.  The male then ordered Mr Macchi to accompany himself and the
defendant to a mall where there
was an automatic teller machine.  Mr Macchi did
so, the male directed him to withdraw the money and added if there was more
than
$50 in the account he wanted that too.  Mr Macchi used his credit card to
withdraw $50 and asked the male if he would then return
the phone in exchange
for the money.  The male snatched the money when it was proffered by Mr Macchi
but refused to hand over the
phone.  After Mr Macchi pleaded with him to do so
he eventually returned the phone.  
<P>

5   	At the conclusion of the prosecution case the magistrate
invited the prosecutor to address her on whether the evidence was
sufficient to
establish that the money had been demanded "with menaces".  Lengthy debate
ensued.  The magistrate then dismissed the
information.  Her reason for doing
so was that she considered that a demand "with menaces" requires some threat of
harm.  She acknowledged
that the threatened harm may be physical, either to the
victim or to somebody known to the victim, or to reputation.  She held that
in
this case there was never any such threat, direct or indirect.  She took into
account the fact that the offence occurred in daylight,
with a lot of people
around, on a public bus and in a shopping mall.  She referred to s 105 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></i> which is in the following terms:
<P>

"It shall be immaterial whether any such menace or threat, as is referred to in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 99</a> - 103 both inclusive, is of violence, or injury, or of an
accusation to be caused, or made, by the offender, or by any other person,
or
whether the accusation, if made, shall purport to be that of the offender, or
some other person."
<P>

6   	It appears that her Worship read s 105 as a definition
section.  This, in my opinion, is erroneous.  S 105, although hardly
felicitously expressed, does not define "menaces", but is intended to broaden
the scope of the conduct encompassed by the word, so
as to include harm done by
words as well as by physical force, and harm done by the words of persons other
than the person accused.
 The section does not however, exclude harm to or
threatened theft of property.  In my view, the threat to steal the telephone
was
<u>capable</u> of amounting to "menaces" within the section.  Whether it
did <u>in fact</u> amount to such "menaces" is a question of fact for the
magistrate.
<P>

7   	Counsel for the DPP referred to a number of decided cases,
both English and Australian that support this approach.  The first
of these was
<b>R  v  Tomlinson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%201%20QB%20706" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 1 QB 706.</a>  The charge in that case was brought
under s 44 of the <i>Larceny Act, 1861</i> which made it a felony to send or
deliver (inter alia) any letter or writing "demanding of any person with
menaces" any property
or money.  It was alleged that the prisoner had written a
letter demanding ten shillings and threatening the recipient that if it
was not
received he would expose the recipient's alleged sexual misconduct.  The
question at issue was whether the sending of the
letter was evidence of
demanding money with menaces.  On behalf of the prisoner it was argued that the
word "menaces" necessarily
imported a threat of injury to the person or the
property of the person threatened.  Lord Russell CJ, with whom the other
members
of the court agreed, while disclaiming an intention to lay down an
exhaustive definition, considered that the word included menaces
or threats of
danger by an accusation of misconduct, including conduct not amounting to a
crime.  It is interesting to note that
even the narrow construction advanced by
counsel for the prisoner in that case accepted that the threat of injury to
property would
have been sufficient.
<P>

8   	In <b>R  v  Boyle and Merchant </b>[1914] 3KB 339 the
English Court of Criminal Appeal considered convictions brought under s 45 of
the same Act which is in substance
the same as s 99.  There the facts were that
the appellants threatened to publish attacks upon a company in a newspaper in
such a
way as to threaten damage to the market price of the shares of the
company.  Lord Reading CJ, Lord Coleridge and Sankey JJ rejected
a contention
that the word "menaces" was restricted to a threat of physical violence or a
threat of injury to character.  The Court
referred with approval to a decision
in <b>R  v  Walton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20Cox%20CC%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">9 Cox, CC 268</a>, which concluded:
<P>

"That if a man is induced to part with his money or property through fear or
alarm he is no longer a free agent and is no longer
capable of parting with the
property with his consent.  If the threat was of a character to produce in an
ordinary man such a degree
of fear or alarm as would `unsettle his mind ... and
take away from his acts that element of free voluntary action which alone
constitutes
consent,' and was made with that intent, it would constitute the
offence under the section now under consideration notwithstanding
that the
threat was not of physical violence or of injury to character."
<P>

9   	The Court in <b>Boyle and Merchant</b> then held:
<P>

"A threat to injure a man's property may be more serious to him and have
greater effect upon his mind than a threat of physical
violence.  When there is
evidence of such a threat as if calculated to operate upon the mind of a person
of ordinarily firm mind,
and the jury have been properly directed, it is for
them to determine whether in fact the conduct of the accused has brought them
within the section, and whether in the particular case the `menace' is
established.  If the threat is of such a character that it
is not calculated to
deprive any person of reasonable sound and ordinarily firm mind of the free and
voluntary action of his mind
it would not be menace within the meaning of that
section.  In our judgment when a man, with intent to steal, threatens either to
do violence to the person of another, or to commit acts calculated to injure
the property or character of another, it is a menace
within the meaning of the
section."
<P>

10   	Both of these cases, and <b>Walton, </b>were referred to
and relied on by the English Court of Appeal in <b>R  v  Clear</b> [1968] 1 QB
670.  The section in question there was in substance similar to s 99, although
the phraseology varied.  The allegation
was that the defendant had threatened
to give evidence detrimental to the case of the complainant in legal
proceedings.  An appeal
against the conviction was dismissed.
<P>

11   	The only Australian case cited on behalf of the plaintiff
was <b>R  v  Rae</b>, a decision of Wood CJ at CL with whom Beazley JA and
Dunford J agreed, delivered on 2 November 1998.  The case came before the Court
of Criminal Appeal by way of stated case from the District Court.  The charge
was brought under s 85ZE(a) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1914</a> (Cth).</i>  That section
prohibited the use of carriage service "to menace or harass another person".
It was alleged that the defendant had
used such a service to convey a threat
that a bomb had been placed in the premises of a commercial entity.  The
question asked in
the stated case, relevant to the present case, was whether it
was correct to hold that the appellant could not be guilty of an offence
against the section because the commercial entity was not threatened with
actual harm, it not being sufficient that a person of normal
stability and
courage might have felt apprehensive for his or her well being had such a
person been a party to the telephone call.
 The question really at issue in
that case, and reasoning that led to a negative answer to the question, do not
really bear on the
present matter.  The judgment was relied on specifically
because of a rider added by way of obiter in these terms:
<P>

"I would add, although it is not specifically raised on the stated case, that I
would regard it as at least arguable that the offence
is made out if the
message conveyed is one giving rise to apprehension as to the safety of
property of the intended recipient.  Although
it is not necessary to decide the
point in this case there is no logical reason to confine `menace' ... to
personal injuries."
<P>

12   	In my opinion the plaintiff has established that the
magistrate misdirected herself by confining too narrowly the word "menaces".
She did not accept that a threat to property might constitute a "menace".  She
took the view, accordingly, that there was no evidence
of "menaces".  This, in
my view, was incorrect.  There was evidence, which she may or may not have
accepted, of a threat to the property
of Mr Macchi which obliged her to
consider whether the threat was such as to come within the meaning of the word
as it appears in
s 99.
<P>

13   	S 109 prescribes the powers of this Court on an appeal
under s 104.  These appear to apply equally to an appeal by an informant
under
s 104(2) as to an appeal by a person convicted.  Accordingly it is appropriate
to make orders 1 and 3 substantially as sought
in the summons.  I see no
utility in making a declaration as sought in order 2.
<P>

14   	The orders I make are:
<P>

1.	The order of the magistrate dismissing the information against the defendant
is quashed;
<P>

2.	The matter is remitted to the magistrate to hear and determine it in
accordance with these conclusions.
