<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  On 20 November 1997 the Second Defendant, a Magistrate,
stayed proceeding on an information laid against the First Defendant on
the
basis that they were oppressive.  The Magistrate held that the proceedings were
an abuse of process.
<P>

2	By Summons filed on 19 December 1997, the Director of Public Prosecutions
sought:-
<P>

1.	An order removing the record of the Local Court (into this Court).
<P>

2.	An order quashing the finding of the Second Defendant that she had
jurisdiction to stay the proceedings.
<P>

3.	An order quashing the order of the Second Defendant staying the
proceedings.
<P>

4.	A declaration that the Second Defendant erred in finding she had
jurisdiction to stay the proceedings.
<P>

5.	A declaration that the Second Defendant erred in staying the proceedings.
<P>

6.	An order pursuant to Section 134 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> that the Second
Defendant hear and determine the information according to law.
<P>

3	On 16 February 1998 Bruce J, pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules, Part 12
Rule 2, removed the proceedings in this Court into the
Court of Appeal which
considered the Magistrate's power to grant a permanent stay in criminal
proceedings of this nature.  By majority
the Court of Appeal declared that a
Magistrate conducting a summary trial of an information has the power to grant
a permanent stay
in a proper case and remitted the proceedings to the Common
Law Division for further hearing.  It is with the issues debated on that
further hearing that these Reasons are concerned. 
<P>

4	The offence alleged in the information was one under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1914</a>
(Cth), s527C, namely that the First Defendant had in premises situate at
Belrose "property to wit, (See Annexure), which may be reasonably
suspected of
being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained".  The annexure extended to 19
pages wherein under headings describing
various parts of the house involved,
there were listed various items commonly found in households in this state.
Thus on the page
headed Bedroom 1 the items listed included:-
<P>

&#183;	2 small Jackeroo sleeping bags.
<P>

&#183;	3 rugs.
<P>

&#183;	1 plastic bag containing various socks.
<P>

&#183;	1 Panasonic 4 system colour television.
<P>

&#183;	40 ties.
<P>

&#183;	1 paint roller.
<P>

5	However, such quantities were by no means typical.  On the pages entitled
"Bedroom 4" there was reference to, inter alia, sixteen
20 pce dinner sets,
fourteen saucepans and fourteen salt and pepper sets.  On the page entitled
"Roof" (which I understand to refer
to the cavity above the ceiling and below
the roof itself) reference was made to, inter alia:-
<P>

&#183;	40 Kyoto brand imperial 57 pce cutlery sets.
<P>

&#183;	20 Kyoto brand teapots.
<P>

&#183;	27 Kyoto brand 20 pce dinner sets.
<P>

&#183;	70 boxes of Lego.
<P>

6	In all approximately 5,000 items were listed.  The Crown case was that the
various items had been found in the First Defendant's
premises on the execution
of a search warrant.  When questioned the Defendant apparently said that all
the items came from K-Mart
at Chatswood, where he worked and where he obtained
staff discounts.  
<P>

7	According to the evidence from a police officer who was called, at the time
of the execution of the search warrant he had invited
the First Defendant to
make available any receipts he could find and on the basis of these and perhaps
some other information the
police officer had not seized all of the contents of
the house.  Thus the annexure to the information contains no reference to items
in a kitchen or living room.  In cross-examination that police officer accepted
that a number of other items to which his attention
was directed were not
suspicious or unlawfully obtained.  However, it was clearly the Crown case that
the vast bulk of the items
had been obtained dishonestly from K-Mart.
<P>

8	In addressing the question whether she should exercise the power to stay
proceedings, the Magistrate made express reference to
the nature of the charge
and the maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment prescribed, the fact that if
the prosecution established
to a prima facie level that there was a suspicion
attaching to the goods that the Defendant had an onus of establishing a defence
provided for by Section 527C, the public interest in the prosecution of people
charged with criminal offences and continued:-
<P>

	"Clearly it must be that to justify a stay on the basis of oppressiveness it
must be that the prosecution in the conduct of it
is more than inconvenient, or
unwieldy, or having logistical difficulties, which can at least be said of this
matter.
<P>

	Having heard what I have heard of the evidence in this case it occurs to me
that the prosecution could have presented a refined
version of the charge, and
may well then have had a strong case to present in respect of some items which
are included in the items
the subject of this charge.
<P>

	And lastly, in respect of this matter, it appears that the prosecution can
present a global case, and it seems that the basis on
which the prosecution
presents their case is in some respects a global case, they relying on the
factors of the quantity of good
overall, and the large number of some items, or
multiple number of some items, which the officer-in-charge says is beyond the
number
of items which people ordinarily have their home for their own domestic
consumption.
<P>

	But while the prosecution can present a global case, the Defendant has to
address individually each item in order to establish
the onus which is cast
upon him of establishing that he did not have - or could not have reasonably
had a suspicion about the goods,
which really requires him to establish how he
acquired the goods in order to rebut the case presented by the prosecution.
And it
appears to me that in requiring the Defendant to provide individual
explanations in respect of 5,000 items that therein lies the
oppression in this
matter, and I'm persuaded that it is a matter that is oppressive, and that
therefore is an appropriate matter
in which to exercise the jurisdiction to say
the proceedings in order to prevent an abuse of process."
<P>

9	Counsel for both parties accepted that, in the circumstances of this case for
the appeal to succeed it had to be shown that the
Magistrate had declined to
exercise or had acted in excess of her jurisdiction.  Reference was made to a
number of authorities of
which it is only necessary to mention <b>Craig v South
Australia</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 184 CLR 163</a> at 176-8; <b>Acuthan v Coates </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6
NSWLR 472</a> at 482-3 and <b>Yisrael v District Court of New South Wales</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%201987%20A%20Crim%20R%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 1987 A Crim R 63.</a>  
<P>

10	The Crown's primary submission was that the Magistrate had declined to
exercise the jurisdiction imposed on her by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s80</a>,
which provides:-
<P>

	"After hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and the evidence
adduced, the said Justice of Justices shall consider
and determine the whole
matter, and convict or make an order upon the Defendant or dismiss the
information or complaint, as the case
may require."
<P>

11	It may be conceded that the Magistrate's decision to stay the proceedings
was taken well prior to the conclusion of the evidence.
 However, it was taken
after about a day's evidence from the chief prosecution witness and at a time
when the basis of the Crown
case was clear and it is a normal incident of
applications to stay proceedings that they are dealt with at a relatively early
stage.
 In light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in this matter it seems
to me impossible to conclude that, merely because the Magistrate
granted the
stay application, she neglected to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80.</a>  As was set by Mason
P in the Court of Appeal in these proceedings, "the power to stay proceedings
permanently for abuse of process
operates, in practice, as an exception to the
duty of a court invested with jurisdiction in a particular proceeding to appear
and
determine that proceeding".
<P>

12	It was also submitted on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions that
the Magistrate had adopted an erroneous test of what
represented oppression as
that expression is to be understood in the subject area of law and had equated
oppression with the problems
necessarily inherent in a difficult case arising
in the terms of Section 527C which, so far as is relevant, provides:-
<P>

	(1) Any person who -
<P>

	(a) has any thing in his custody;
<P>

	(b) ....
<P>

	(c) has any thing in or on premises, whether belonging to or occupied by
himself or not, or whether that thing is there for his
own use or the use of
another; or
<P>

	(d) ...
<P>

	which thing may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise
unlawfully obtained, shall be liable on conviction before
a stipendiary
magistrate to imprisonment for 6 months, or to a fine of 5 penalty units.
<P>

	(2)  It is a sufficient defence to a prosecution for an offence under
subsection (1) if the defendant satisfies the court that
he had no reasonable
grounds for suspecting that the thing referred to in the charge was stolen or
otherwise unlawfully obtained.
<P>

13	Even were this the correct analysis of what the Magistrate had done, it
would seem to me to be an error which fell within the
exercise of her
jurisdiction rather than one which demonstrated a failure to exercise it - see
<b>Acuthan v Coates</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSW%20LR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSW LR 472</a> at 482.  However it is not, I
think, an accurate summary of what the Second Defendant did.  A decision
whether to stay proceedings
"falls to be determined by a weighing process
involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and considerations" -
<b>Walton v Gardiner</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20177%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 177 CLR 378</a> at 396.  The summary I have given
and the extracts from the Magistrate's Reasons I have quoted show that this is
what the Magistrate
did and although she identified a difficulty the First
Defendant faced as the circumstance demonstrating oppression it is not correct
to say that she simply equated the two.
<P>

14	It is correct, as Senior Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions
contended, that the nature and particulars of the charge
brought meant that the
Defendant was obliged to address individually each item, or at least each group
of items and establish that
he had not reasonable grounds for suspecting that
the item (or group) was "stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained."  However
this
by no means demonstrates that the charge as presented was not oppressive.
There is nothing in the legislation or the circumstances
of the case which
compelled the Crown to include 5,000 items as the subject of the charge.  That
having been done, it is not altogether
surprising that a Magistrate found the
burden thereby imposed on the Defendant, excessive.  
<P>

15	It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that that burden merely arose
because of the circumstances of the case and, though the
matter was put more
discreetly, but matched the Defendant's apparent criminality and nothing would
have been achieved and more oppression
created, had the charge been broken up
into many charges each dealing with one or a limited number of items.
Furthermore, so the
argument ran, in respect of any one charge the Crown would
have tendered the totality of evidence, thus making the First Defendant's
task
as formidable as it was under the charge as formulated.
<P>

16	That may be so.  But in respect of any one charge, the Defendant would not
have had to show the existence of reasonable grounds
except in respect of the
item or items the subject of that charge.  A person who has, or would seem to
have, committed a large number
of offences, can have no legitimate complaint if
each is charged against him but he does have a complaint - and indeed so does
the
system of administration of justice - if these matters are all lumped
together and made the subject of one charge.  The inclusion
of some 5000 items
in the charge preferred clearly provided grounds for the magistrate to conclude
as she did.  There was no error
calling for the intervention of this Court.  In
so concluding I am not unconscious of the remarks of Mason P in the Court of
Appeal
querying whether the magistrate had based her decision on (mere)
disapproval of the charge as laid but having reflected on what Her
Worship
said, it does not seem to me that her decision is to be understood on that
basis.
<P>

17	Save and except for the orders and declaration previously made in these
proceedings, the summons should be dismissed.
<P>

18	That is the order I make.
