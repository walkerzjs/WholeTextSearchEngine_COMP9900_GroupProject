<center><b>16978/85 - ZIVADIN STEVANOVIC  v MILAN STJELJA &amp;
ORS</b></center>
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT - Stay Application</b>
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter I have given judgment and the matter to be dealt
with this morning is the defendants' application
for a stay on terms pending an
appeal.
<P>

2	The plaintiff does not oppose a stay as such, provided an appropriate interim
payment is awarded.  In any event, I think it would
be appropriate to grant a
stay, applying the principles enunciated by Maxwell J in<b> </b><i>Andrews v
John Fairfax &amp; Sons</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSWLR%20184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2 NSWLR 184.</a>  The real question is the
interim payment.
<P>

3	The defendants would not argue with a sum of around $400,000.  The plaintiff
seeks $1.2 million, in an affidavit of 17 March 1999,
on the basis that it
would provide him with accommodation and a reasonable income.  In the same
affidavit he undertakes not to dispose
of any home or other asset he might
acquire with that money, pending the outcome of the appeal.
<P>

4	 I am sympathetic to the plaintiff's position, but it does appear to me to be
a very large proportion of the judgment to order
as an interim payment.  The
judgment itself amounts to about $1.4 million.
<P>

5	I have arrived at an interim payment with an eye to the amount by which the
judgment might be reduced if the appeal were successful.
 It seems that the
challenge is primarily to my assessment of economic loss, past and future.  My
assessment of the amount by which
the judgment might be reduced in the event of
a successful appeal is necessarily speculative, but the reduction could be
something
of the order of $500,000 to $600,000.  For these reasons I consider
the appropriate interim payment to be $850,000.
<P>

6	I note that a notice of appeal has been filed. Accordingly, I would grant a
stay of execution of the judgment, pending the outcome
of the appeal, provided
the defendants make an interim payment to the plaintiff of $850,000 within 21
days.
<P>

7	Mr Fletcher raised with me on the last occasion the question of whether I
could order that Social Security payments not be refunded
until the appeal is
determined. If it seems I do have the power to make such an order I may be
sympathetic to it, but I will grant
liberty to apply on that aspect.
<P>

	<b>20548/95 - Zivadin Stevanovicv FAI General Insurance</b>
<P>

8	In matter 20548 of 1995, the defendant seeks an unconditional stay of
execution of the judgment pending the outcome of the appeal.
 The plaintiff
does not oppose that order and I make that order.
<P>

9	Exhibits will stay with the file until the determination.
<P>
