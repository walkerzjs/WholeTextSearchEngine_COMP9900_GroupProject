030060/98	<b>"JMR"   v   THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT
OF JUVENILE JUSTICE (First Defendant) &amp; THE SUPERINTENDENT
OF WORIMI
JUVENILE JUSTICE CENTRE (Second Defendant)</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : In these proceedings a number of grounds have been argued aimed
at the prevention of the movement of JMR from Worimi
Juvenile Justice Centre to
Mt Penang Juvenile Justice Centre.
<P>

2	To a consideration of those grounds I shall turn presently.
<P>

3	JMR pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court at Newcastle on 13 November 1996 to
the manslaughter of his mother and his sister twelve
months before.  Both
victims died of stab wounds inflicted by JMR.
<P>

4	The charges in both cases were reduced from murder to manslaughter by reason
of the availability of the defence of diminished
responsibility.  JMR was only
fourteen years of age at the time of sentence and the background to the
offences was indeed a tragic
one.  From a very tender age JMR had been sexually
abused by his father on many occasions and the father was eventually imprisoned
for these offences and for offences against other victims.  The learned
sentencing judge, the former Chief Judge at Common Law, when
dealing with JMR,
observed in his sentencing remarks:
<P>

	<i>"These killings were the horrible conclusion to a chain of circumstances
which - for the human tragedy which they disclose - are frankly
outside my long
experience in the law, which includes now almost eighteen years of trial and
appellate work in the Supreme Court
and the Court of Criminal Appeal."</i>
<P>

5	It was common ground on the medical evidence placed before the sentencing
judge that the abnormality of mind from which JMR was
suffering resulted from
the sexual abuse inflicted by his father.
<P>

6	At the time of being sentenced, and indeed from the time he had been taken
into custody immediately after the offences, JMR was
at Worimi where he has
remained until the present time.
<P>

7	In passing sentence Hunt CJ at CL addressed the issue of eventual
rehabilitation and said (at pp 11-12):
<P>

	<i>"The prospects of eventual rehabilitation here are reasonable, but it is
going to take a long time.  Since being at Worimi, the prisoner
has improved
his educational standard considerably, and he has shown improvement in his
social skills.  The helpful background report
provided by the Department of
Juvenile Justice is rightly proud of its assistance, which has enabled the
prisoner to excel in his
studies.  It is not without significance, of course,
that the improvement in the prisoner's behaviour has occurred in the relative
safety and predictable nature of the structure provided at that Centre.  The
continuing support from his maternal grandparents has
also played a significant
part.  The prisoner has enrolled in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, and he
has already participated
in community service work.  All of this good news must
nevertheless be tempered by a recognition of the prisoner's continued
vulnerability
to extreme reactions, and his continuing difficulties in forming
any relationships with others of his age.  He has formed close relations
with
the staff at the Centre, who should be commended for their support and for the
degree of success which has been achieved.</i>
<P>

<i>	Dr Miller (the psychiatrist) expresses concern for the prisoner's state of
mind in the future.  He says that there will undoubtedly
be significant
problems in the future.  Other psychiatrists agree.  Dr Jurek says that the
prisoner will remain vulnerable to every
kind of psychiatric disorder and to
drug and alcohol abuse.  She said that his prognosis is poor.  Dr Nielssen
thought that the prognosis
must be guarded.  I am impressed by the view
expressed by Dr Miller.</i>
<P>

<i>	I also accept the opinion expressed by Dr Miller that the main focus for
the prisoner's rehabilitation must be the maintenance for
some time of the
secure environment in which he presently feels safe and is able to develop self
confidence and awareness, and I
share the doctor's anxiety should the prisoner
be transferred to another centre where the trusting links with the staff which
he
now has will have to be established once more.  The prisoner himself wishes
to stay at Worimi.  He told Dr Miller (whose report was
tendered on his behalf)
that he is particularly anxious that he be given a custodial sentence of at
least five years, so that he
can spend a further four years at Worimi -</i>
<P>

<i>	`... safe from what he perceives to be a revengeful world.  He is fully
aware that he will be branded a killer in the community,
and feels that this
will be a continuation of the teasing he has received at school.'</i>
<P>

<i>	This statement has been accepted by Dr Miller without qualification.  Given
his experience, I have assumed that he is satisfied that
a child not yet
fifteen has the maturity to understand the significance of that concession.
The period nominated by the prisoner
is a realistic one.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is obvious that the prisoner should stay at Worimi for the whole of the
custodial part of his sentence.  The order pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19</a> of the Act that the
prisoner serve the whole of the custodial portion of his sentence in a
detention centre will therefore be accompanied
by a recommendation that it be
served at Worimi."</i>
<P>

8	His Honour then went on to sentence JMR on each charge of manslaughter to
penal servitude for ten years with a minimum term of
five years and an
additional term of five years, with such sentences to be served concurrently.
His Honour ordered that the whole
of the custodial period of the sentence be
served in a detention centre and recommended that the sentence be served at
Worimi Detention
Centre.
<P>

9	JMR has now been at Worimi for more than three years.  He will become
eligible for release upon parole on 12 November 2000.  It
is his wish that he
remain where he is, and he is accordingly resistant to the intended transfer to
Mt Penang.
<P>

10	The following evidence was introduced in these proceedings presently before
the Court:
<P>

(i)	several affidavits sworn by JMR's maternal grandmother (who I shall not
name in the interests of preserving JMR's anonymity);
<P>

(ii)	several affidavits sworn by Dr Bruce Chenoweth, JMR's treating
psychiatrist.  Dr Chenoweth also gave oral evidence;
<P>

(iii)	Dr Kenneth Nunn gave oral evidence, his report of 21 October 1996 having
been an annexure to one of Dr Chenoweth's affidavits;
<P>

(iv)	an affidavit by Dr John Miller, a psychiatrist who assessed the plaintiff
in 1996;
<P>

(v)	an affidavit of Mr Chandler, JMR's class teacher since his detention at
Worimi;
<P>

(vi)	an affidavit of Mr Jack, the principal of Wallis Plains School, which is
attached to Worimi and where JMR could finish his
secondary schooling if he
stays at Worimi;
<P>

(vii)	an affidavit of Ms Hussain, a nurse at Worimi;
<P>

(viii)	an affidavit of Ms Conlon, another nurse at Worimi;
<P>

(ix)	an affidavit of Mr Johns, the key youth worker attached to JMR since his
detention.
<P>

11	In the case for the defendants the following affidavits were introduced:
<P>

(x)	an affidavit sworn by the second defendant, Ms Johnston;
<P>

(xi)	an affidavit sworn by Mr Gould, superintendent of Mt Penang.
<P>

12	Ms Johnston and Mr Gould both gave oral evidence.
<P>

13	The evidence establishes that the plaintiff has progressed well at Worimi.
Academically he has made what Mr Chandler has described
as <i>"amazing
progress"</i>.  He has completed Year 10 and Mr Jack thinks he is capable of
doing Years 11 and 12.  Mr Jack thinks he will require substantial
supervision
and educational support however to complete his schooling.  Both Mr Chandler
and Mr Jack considered Worimi to be a better
location than Mt Penang for JMR's
further education.  Having heard Mr Gould's evidence about study facilities at
Mt Penang, I accept
the assessment made by Mr Chandler and Mr Jack.
<P>

14	JMR appears to have formed good relationships with staff members, in
particular with Mr Johns and Mr Chandler.  He also had a
good relationship with
Ms O'Brien, the psychologist attached to Worimi, before her departure overseas
in March 1998.  Ms Serhan,
a case work co-ordinator, apparently assumed a
mother image to JMR, but Ms Johnston gave evidence that that relationship has
recently
deteriorated since JMR became aware that Ms Serhan now supports his
transfer to Mt Penang.
<P>

15	JMR has been fortunate to enjoy the close support of his grandmother and of
his grandfather, both of whom attended Court throughout
the present hearing.
They were accompanied by JMR's aunt and uncle, each of whom is obviously
supportive.  In her affidavits JMR's
grandmother has expressed her concern if
JMR is moved because he has responded so well at Worimi and because Worimi is
the only place
at which JMR has ever felt safe.  JMR has expressed concern to
Mr Chandler about going to Mt Penang on some three or four occasions,
saying:
<P>

	<i>"There are people waiting to get me at Mt Penang.  If I go to Mt Penang I
will be gang raped."</i>
<P>

16	The plaintiff's grandmother who lives at Teralba has been a very regular
visitor at Worimi but some twelve months ago suffered
a severe physical injury
which has prevented her from driving and she also has difficulty walking.  Not
only can the grandmother
not drive now but her husband cannot drive either.
Hence since the grandmother's accident, the grandparents have been dependent on
a friend to drive them to Worimi and the difficulties of regular visits will be
far greater should JMR be moved further away to Mt
Penang.  The desirability of
regular and frequent visits for so long as the plaintiff remains detained in
whatever place is obvious
and has been stressed in the psychiatric evidence.
<P>

17	The evidence disclosed that Worimi is primarily a remand centre, with
capacity to accommodate thirty-five detainees.  A small
number of sentenced
detainees, ranging from eight to ten, are kept there for some part of their
committal.  Worimi comprises a two
storey building described as having <i>"low
ceilings and narrow corridors"</i> and <i>"no grassed recreational
areas"</i>.
<P>

18	By way of contrast, Mt Penang is a larger detention centre which
accommodates 128 detainees.  There are three closed units, and
one open unit,
each accommodating up to thirty-two detainees.  It is proposed that the
plaintiff should be placed at Karinya, the
open unit where Mr Gould said there
are usually about twenty-five detainees.  The accommodation at Karinya is
dormitory accommodation.
 Those selected for placement at Karinya satisfy the
following requirements, according to Mr Gould:
<P>

	<i>"(i)	the detainee displaying a positive move towards rehabilitation;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	the detainee's level of co-operation with staff;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	the willingness of the detainee to become involved in community
programmes;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	the vulnerability of a detainee."</i>
<P>

19	Those detained at Karinya dine separately from those in the other units.
<P>

20	The psychiatric disorder from which the plaintiff has suffered at all
relevant times in the past and continues to suffer has
been defined by his
treating psychiatrist as a "Dissociative Identity Disorder"<i>.  </i>It is the
existence and the perceived significance of this disorder which has been the
focus of the plaintiff's application presently
before this Court.
<P>

21	Before considering the psychiatric evidence and the evidence of Ms Johnston
in close detail, it is appropriate to record the
grounds upon which the
plaintiff seeks relief in this Court.  The points of claim are very lengthy,
but in the course of the hearing
Ms Moen of counsel, for the plaintiff,
distilled the challenge to the intended transfer to the following grounds:
<P>

(i)	that the decision to transfer the plaintiff was unreasonable;
<P>

(ii)	that it involved a denial of natural justice;
<P>

(iii)	that the decision was ultra vires;
<P>

(iv)	that the implementation of the decision should be restrained to prevent
commission of the tort of negligence.
<P>

(The points of claim fashioned various forms of relief including applications
for declarations and a quia timet injunction.)
<P>

22	I shall now consider the above four grounds in turn.
<P>

	<b>(i) Unreasonableness</b>
<P>

23	The decision challenged is the decision taken by Ms Johnston as the
superintendent at Worimi to arrange for the transfer of the
plaintiff to Mt
Penang.  It is challenged as being "unreasonable" within the meaning of that
concept as considered by Lord Greene
M.R. in <i>Associated Provincial Picture
Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1947/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] EWCA Civ 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%201%20KB%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] 1 KB 223</a> at 229 and
following.
<P>

24	At the outset it is necessary to identify the decision which is challenged,
because the evidence has made it clear that Ms Johnston
had the contemplated
transfer in mind for a considerable period before the summons was filed to
commence these proceedings on 26
June 1998.
<P>

25	An adjournment during the course of the hearing to enable a precise
definition of the "decision" was granted.  Following such
adjournment, it was
made clear that the decision challenged was the decision made by Ms Johnston in
October 1996.  This of course
calls for concentration upon the position at that
time and the basis upon which the decision maker then acted.  On the other
hand,
for the purposes of the fourth ground of challenge, for the restraint of
the anticipated tort, the due consideration of that ground
would, the parties
agreed, involve consideration of all that has occurred since October 1996,
including the expression of the more
comprehensive medical opinions since that
time.
<P>

26	Where is the October decision to be found and what was it?  These questions
are answered in paragraph 12 of the second defendant's
affidavit:
<P>

	<i>"In about October 1996, I decided that, subject to any change in
circumstances and any representations made by specialist staff, the
plaintiff
and/or his tutor and her husband (`the plaintiff's grandparents'), the
plaintiff should, if sentenced, be transferred to
Reiby in about twelve months
time and, thereafter, to Mount Penang.  In this regard, I was of the opinion
that while the general
policy provided for the plaintiff to be transferred
immediately after sentencing, the circumstances of the plaintiff's case made
it
appropriate for his transfer to be delayed until his therapeutic programme had
progressed to an appropriate stage."</i>
<P>

27	At about that time Ms Johnson said that in conjunction with Ms Serhan she
prepared a case plan for the plaintiff, a copy of which
was annexed to her
affidavit.  This case plan was developed for attachment to the background
report to be put before the Supreme
Court for sentencing purposes in November
1996.  That plan involved psychological assessments after sentencing for a
variety of purposes
referred to in the plan itself.  Further the plan involved
participation of other staff for specified purposes and provision for
schooling.  It also involved counselling for the past sexual assaults and
planning for encouragement of visitors.  It involved the
consideration of
<i>"appropriate accommodation placements during the period of custody, with a
view to planning during the pre-release phase (i.e. to
be incorporated into the
exit case plan)"</i>.
<P>

28	Ms Johnston discussed the planned transfer to Mt Penang in June 1997 and
thereafter explained the reasons for the planned transfer
in her letter dated
14 August 1997 which she wrote in response to a request from the Newcastle
Legal Centre:
<P>

	<i>"In summary, the reasons for [JMR's] transfer are:</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	The opportunity to experience change (eg, in environment, support
people, peers, experiences, etc.) while still having support
structures and
controls available.  This is in terms of [JMR's] ultimate return to the
community (in 2000), during which there will
be a range of issues associated
with change, and at that time he will have reduced support structures in the
wider community;</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	Related to the above, the opportunity to challenge the `comfort
zone' which has established and is continuing to strengthen
in the Worimi
environment, and the familiarity [JMR] has with those around him, which could
be detrimental to the development of
coping strategies for the future;</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	Wider range of vocational training programmes, and greater intensity
in training which is applicable to the workplace;</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	Greater community interaction opportunities, both within and outside
the centre, based on Mount Penang being a committal centre
and the number of
detainees eligible for community activities;</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	Interaction with a larger number of other young people of his own
age;</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	Residence with other detainees who are serving sentences, to
introduce longer term, more stable relationships with peers in
similar
situations; and</i>
<P>

<i>	&#176;	Very importantly, the expertise of Mount Penang staff in working
with young people sentenced under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 19</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal
Proceedings) Act 1987</a>, in the preparation of Submissions for Consideration of
Release on Parole.  We do limited work in this area, and also do not have
the
full gambit of opportunities for detainees to fulfil the areas highlighted in
parole submissions.</i>
<P>

<i>	Specialist services currently involved with [JMR] are all available at
Mount Penang.  There is also greater opportunity for groupwork
at that centre,
given the higher number of detainees.</i>
<P>

<i>	Dr Nunn, a child psychiatry specialist, visited the centre recently.  He
spent time with [JMR] and [his grandparents].  I am informed
that Dr Nunn was
in support of the transfer, but advised that this should be done carefully,
sensitively and in a structured manner.
 This is certainly part of the planned
transfer, as I am well aware of the issues associated with transferring a young
person like
[JMR].  The transfer will be planned and structured, and all
available support will be provided to [JMR].</i>
<P>

<i>	In conclusion, it is my opinion that if [JMR] were to remain at Worimi for
the duration of his sentence, ending in November 2000,
that would not be
helpful for him.  Based on my experiences with such cases, I do not view it as
in the interests of [JMR's] total
well being to remain at this centre, and not
experience any changes or challenges, which will prepare him for his return to
the community
after a very extensive period of time in detention."</i>
<P>

29	In her thoughtful and comprehensive submissions, Ms Moen challenged the
decision taken in October 1996 as being premature, to
the point of being taken
before the sentence and consideration of the remarks of the sentencing judge.
It should not have been taken,
it was submitted, without due consideration of
appropriate psychiatric and psychological assessment of the plaintiff.  This
was particularly
so considering the framework of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Detention
Centres) Act, 1987</a></i> and the paramount consideration which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a> directed
should be given to the welfare of those subject to control.  The decision was
unreasonable in 1986 because of the absence
of cogent evidence to support the
decision.  Ms Moen referred in support of this submission to <i>Luu v
Renevier</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/518.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 518</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2091%20ALR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 91 ALR 39</a> and to dicta in the joint judgment of the Federal
Court in that case at 47:
<P>

	<i>"The effect of a finding of fact by a decision maker which is unsupported
by the evidence must depend upon the significance of that
finding.  If the
finding relates only to a matter of peripheral importance, the validity of the
decision may remain unaffected. 
But where the finding is critical to the
ultimate decision, it is impossible to sustain the decision."</i>
<P>

30	Ms Johnston was cross examined about the information she had and the
inquiries she made before reaching her decision in October
1996.  One of the
sources to whom she said she had regard was Dr Miller, but plainly the witness
was wrong about this because his
report did not become available until the
following month.  Ms Johnston said however, and I accept, that she consulted
with the centre's
psychologist and that she had 
<P>

	<i>"information from the centre support team which is a multi disciplinary
team made up of registered nurse, psychologist and other counsellors
via their
regular meetings they have about young people in detention." (T94).</i>
<P>

31	For reasons of confidentiality departmental procedure restrained Ms Johnston
from seeing the reports but she was able through
staff members to inform
herself of available assessments and said that she <i>"had numerous discussions
with the co-ordinated case worker"</i> (T95).  That discussion concerned
entries in psychological progress notes.
<P>

32	Ms Johnston was then asked the following questions and gave the following
answers (T96):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  ...at that particular stage of October 1996, did you have available to
you any expert psychological opinion that remaining at
Worimi would be harmful
for the plaintiff's mental health putting aside all other issues of what might
be good or bad for him, did
you have any expert psychological opinion that
remaining at Worimi would be damaging to his mental health?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I did not.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Did you have any expert opinion to that effect at that stage?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That it would be damaging?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Yes, damaging to his mental health as opposed to anything else?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  To remain at Worimi?</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I did not.</i>
<P>

<i>	HIS HONOUR:  Q.  What about the reverse.  Did you have any information in
the form of expert evidence available to you as to any
adverse impact of him
being transferred?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  The information I had at that time was that the environment of Worimi
and the relationships within Worimi were beneficial for
the plaintiff and that
it was certainly helpful to his treatment.  And I am sorry I am recalling - and
the information was also about
if there was any consideration that the
preference was for him to remain at Worimi, that was certainly my understanding
but if there
was any consideration of transfer from Worimi that that needed to
be carefully considered how that was done.  At that time in October
1996, that
was my understanding of the information available."</i>
<P>

33	In considering the reasonableness of what Ms Johnston decided in October
1996, it is important to have regard to the context
in which the decision was
taken.  It was a planning decision made at a point of time after the plaintiff
had been in custody for
some eleven months.  It was a required planning
decision having regard to a directive of the Executive Director of Juvenile
Justice
Centres, which directive had been addressed to the superintendents of
the various juvenile justice centres in October 1994 concerning
the transfer of
detainees.  A copy of this direction became Exhibit F and it prescribed
guidelines for the transfer of detainees,
including <i>"Routine (Plan)
Transfers"</i>, inter alia after <i>"reclassification"</i>.  When the decision
was taken by Ms Johnston in October 1996 it was in anticipation of the pending
reclassification once sentence
was imposed on JMR.
<P>

34	Exhibit F assumes relevance because it places the decision made in 1996 in
context.  It was essentially a planning decision.
 The directive in Exhibit F
could not justify an irrational and arbitrary decision to move a detainee
immediately, without regard
to relevant considerations, but it seems to me that
Ms Johnson's decision in October 1996 could not be so categorised.  The second
defendant did not at that time decide when the transfer would take place;
rather the decision then was that the transfer should be
delayed <i>"until his
therapeutic progress had progressed to an appropriate stage"</i>.  It was also
a decision taken <i>"subject to any change in circumstances and any
representations made by specialist staff, the plaintiff and his
grandparents."</i>
<P>

35	Dr Miller concluded in November 1996 that it was his recommendation that JMR
remain where he was <i>"for at least one or two years"</i>.  Even had that
report been available before the second defendant made her decision that could
not have rendered the decision for
a delayed transfer <i>"until therapeutic
progress had progressed to an appropriate stage"</i> an unreasonable
decision.
<P>

36	Nor in my opinion could the evidence of Dr Nunn or Dr Chenoweth be regarded
as rendering Ms Johnston's decision unreasonable.
 Nor could the recommendation
of the sentencing judge.
<P>

37	Ms Johnston referred to Dr Nunn in her letter to the Newcastle Legal Centre
in the passage extracted above.  Dr Nunn did not
see the plaintiff until July
1997.  When he subsequently reported on 7 August 1997 to Dr Chenoweth, Dr Nunn
said:
<P>

	<i>"The staff at Worimi are in need of external people like yourself because
of the intensity of the relationship that has developed
in such a closed
setting.  I have, and will be, encouraging them to take up some of the issues
raised by our visit.  The biggest
single management issue is the need to decide
on a date for him to be transferred to alternative facilities if he moves at
all. 
The biggest therapeutic issue will be how best to pursue integration.  If
it is too fast, he may become aggressive or even suicidal.
 If it is too slow
he may not be ready to move and may remain vulnerable to the first person who
calls him a paedophile.  Should
any key staff leave (eg Ms O'Brien, Ms Serhan
or his teacher), there are obviously going to be flashpoints..."</i>
<P>

38	Later under the heading "Summary and Recommendations", Dr Nunn wrote:
<P>

	<i>"A decision about [JMR] - one way or the other - should be made.  If a move
is to be made sufficient notice must be given and the
grandparents reassured
about contact.  By enough notice, I mean at least six to eight months, taking
into account the school year."</i>
<P>

39	In his oral evidence Dr Nunn said that when he was at Worimi for the
purposes of his assessment, there was discussion about the
transfer issue.
This discussion was either with Ms Johnston or Ms Serhan but what Dr Nunn said
was, according to his evidence at
T21:
<P>

	<i>"If a transfer must take place then it ought to take place with a great
deal of preparation, it ought to take place incrementally,
and the people - and
the place to which [JMR] was going needed considerable preparation as
well."</i>
<P>

40	Later in cross examination Dr Nunn was asked these questions and gave these
answers (T26):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  On the basis that that transfer was to take place you came up with a
proposal as to what would best fit him for transfer, and
that is, it being
undertaken carefully, sensitively and in a structured manner.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Would you make any criticism of somebody who proceeded with the
transfer on that basis?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, no I wouldn't.  The crucial issue there is to build in the
capacity, to monitor the successful progression, because one can
do all those
things but the sensitivity issue means that you have to have built in a
capacity to know if it's going wrong."</i>
<P>

41	Dr Chenoweth addressed reports to the psychologist at Worimi in September
1997 and in February 1998 in which the subject of the
proposed transfer was
addressed.  In the earlier report Dr Chenoweth wrote:
<P>

	<i>"I believe this to be a most critical time in his rehabilitation.  I would
encourage the administration to hold him for as long as
possible at Worimi.  He
is only 16 in January and is expanding his outside and other options in a
gradual and somewhat belated but
none the less age-appropriate way.</i>
<P>

<i>	If it is at all possible I would advocate delaying his transfer to Mt
Penang until mid 1998.  I understand that the real world will
challenge him
much more down there but his Dissociative Identity Disorder really needs as
much integration as possible before he
is exposed to those kinds of challenges.
I am sure that Dr Nunn would agree with this given the caution he raised about
attempts
at integrating the good and bad bits of [JMR] prematurely."</i>
<P>

42	Then in the report of February 1998 Dr Chenoweth wrote:
<P>

	<i>"I note the time and effort that is going into the preparation of [JMR] for
this transfer and in particular the transition case plan
being compiled
including the educational component.  The transition plan as outlined seems
fine to me.  I have not much to add to
the carefully considered document
presented.  I particularly like the farewell dinner and the `right of passage'
built into this
transition.  If at all possible I would like him to regard this
as the next logical move in his rehabilitative and maturational process
rather
than as something to be feared."</i>
<P>

43	Dr Chenoweth was asked in cross examination the following question and gave
the following answer at T10:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  At that time, when you wrote that letter of 18 February 1998, did you
think that the transfer was so unwise that no reasonable
person could have made
the decision to transfer him?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I considered that there were many forces operating and that I
wished to maintain a good and cordial relationship with those
maintaining his
care, as well as with the young person concerned.  But in my own mind, it was
making the best of a situation that
was inevitable."</i>
<P>

44	Later in cross examination he was asked these further questions and gave
these further answers:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  I will ask you to assume if you will, a fact that the proposed
transfer of the plaintiff was to be delayed until July 1998 at
that
time?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Can I suggest to you that the decision to delay the transfer, for what
was in effect another nine months, from the time that
you provided that report,
was entirely consistent with your report?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, it was entirely consistent with my report.  I would also like to
say, if I may, there was another factor involved, that
was that since that
report was written, I assumed a much higher profile in the management of the
boy; that at that stage I was doing
assessments every so often and the main
management was in the hands of Miss O'Brien.  She would ring and let me know
how things were
going.  In the ensuring year or so, I have got to know him a
lot more, a lot better and in a sense my position has hardened slightly.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  I was actually going to suggest that your position has hardened to a
great degree and am I correct in putting that proposition
to you?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I think it is better for him that he stays at Worimi.  Yes, I have come
to that conclusion, as I have got to know him better.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  You have now reached the stage where you would say that a decision to
transfer him now would be so unreasonable that no reasonable
decision maker
would make it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  No, I certainly would not go that far.  I would not go that far.  I
think it would be an unwise decision, given what happened
for him but we have
extraordinarily competent people in both places.  I think the major issue has
more to do with the strength of
his attachments, than it has to do with the
programmes, or the competence of personnel at either institution."</i>
<P>

45	The evidence I have reviewed above from Dr Nunn and Dr Chenoweth was not, of
course, available to Ms Johnston in October 1996
but even if it had been its
existence could not, in my opinion, have rendered the decision made in October
1996 an unreasonable one
and I reject the submission that it was necessarily
unreasonable for Ms Johnston to have formed the conditional decision she
reached
in October 1996 without having sought direct guidance from either Dr
Chenoweth or Dr Nunn.
<P>

46	I shall consider the evidence of these two specialists further when looking
at ground (iv), but it seems to me that their evidence
does not assist the
plaintiff on this first ground.
<P>

47	The decision in October 1996 has to be regarded in its chronological
context, heeding that it was a planning decision, and heeding
also the
qualifications contained in the decision as expressed in paragraph 12 of the
second defendant's affidavit.
<P>

48	Having reflected on the relevant evidence and the competing submissions in
this case, I conclude that the second defendant's
decision has not been proved
to be unreasonable in the <i>Wednesbury</i> sense and that this first ground
fails.
<P>

	<b>(ii)	Denial of natural justice</b>
<P>

49	The second defendant acknowledges that neither JMR nor his grandparents were
consulted before the decision in October 1996 was
reached.  Ms Johnston has
stated her reason for lack of prior consultation in paragraph 15 of her
affidavit:
<P>

	<i>"At that time (that is in October 1996) I did not inform either the
plaintiff's grandparents or the plaintiff of my decision because
I was
concerned that informing them at that time might prejudice the plaintiff's
therapeutic programme."</i>
<P>

50	Ms Johnston was not challenged as to the above explanation and I accept that
explanation.
<P>

51	I accept therefore that the second defendant had the plaintiff's interests
in mind in not raising the matter with either his
grandparents or himself in
October 1996.  However Ms Johnston did not then intend to attempt to implement
that decision without consultation
with the grandparents or the plaintiff.  I
accept, as she deposed in her affidavit, that the decision in 1996 was made,
inter alia,
subject to consideration of any representations made by JMR or his
grandparents.  I accept further that there was consultation, as
Ms Johnston
claims, in June 1997 before she wrote the letter to the Newcastle Legal Centre.
I am satisfied that the representations
on behalf of JMR were taken into
account and in all the circumstances I am not persuaded by this submission.  It
has not been proved
that the October 1996 decision involved a denial of natural
justice.
<P>

	<b>(iii)	That the decision was ultra vires</b>
<P>

52	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Detention Centres) Act, 1987</a></i> provides:
<P>

	<i>"	(1)  The Director-General may, by order in writing, direct the transfer
of a person on remand or a person subject to control from
one detention centre
to another..."</i>
<P>

53	Ms Moen submitted correctly that before JMR can be transferred there must be
a direction complying with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13.</a>  Her further submission was that the section
does not authorise the superintendent of a detention centre to order the
transfer, and
therefore the decision made by Ms Johnston in October 1996 was
ultra vires.
<P>

54	It seems to me that that submission misconceives the nature of the decision
made by the second defendant and the nature of the
action contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13.</a>
What Ms Johnston decided should be done in October 1996 was, as I remarked
earlier, a decision made in a planning context.  It was
not a direction for
transfer under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13.</a>  Ms Johnston was not purporting to make an order under
that section.
<P>

55	Doubtless before JMR can be transferred to Mt Penang an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a>
will be required from the Director General.  However it does not follow that
the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> strip the superintendent of the detention centre of
authority to make a decision that a detainee should be transferred.  There has
been no evidence as to the procedure that is followed but it seems to me that
the existence of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> is entirely consistent with the procedure under which the
Director General might act on the recommendation of the superintendent
of a
detention centre in making an order under that section.  Whether the Director
General would necessarily act on such a recommendation
or the reasoning behind
it is not a matter with which this Court is presently concerned.
<P>

56	This submission fails.
<P>

<b>(iv)	That the implementation of the decision should be restrained to prevent
the commission of the tort of negligence</b>
<P>

57	As I observed earlier, the parties agreed that a consideration of this
ground is not restricted to the position in October 1996,
and that, on the
contrary, all the evidence that has been introduced, including the current
opinions expressed in the witness box
by Dr Nunn and by Dr Chenoweth, should be
taken into account.
<P>

58	Ms Moen has submitted that if effect is indeed given to the decision to
transfer JMR to Mt Penang this would involve breach of
a duty of care owed by
the defendants to the plaintiff such as would be likely to cause harm to him.
Therefore it is submitted that
the Court should intervene by the grant of an
injunction to restrain the transfer.
<P>

59	I am satisfied that the defendants do owe the plaintiff a duty to exercise
reasonable care for his safety.
<P>

60	Ms Moen referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> </i>as justifying the
grant of an injunction such as the plaintiff seeks.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66(1)</a> provides:
<P>

	<i>"The court may, at any stage of proceedings, by interlocutory or other
injunction, restrain any threatened or apprehended breach of
contract or other
injury."</i>
<P>

61	That sub-section, it is submitted, is wide enough to confer a power to
restrain any threatened tort that may cause injury.
<P>

62	Counsel was not able to take the Court to a case where <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66</a> has been used in
an analogous way.  However in <i>Prisoners A to XX Inclusive v State of New
South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2075%20A%20Crim%20R%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 75 A Crim R 205</a> Dunford J had before him a case in which
prisoners sought quia timet injunctions to restrain breach of duty by the
Department of
Corrective Services.  Those injunctions were not granted for
reasons which it is unnecessary to consider but Ms Moen drew encouragement
from
the following passage in his Honour's judgment at 213:
<P>

	<i>"Although Equity in its auxiliary jurisdiction has traditionally granted
injunctions to restrain the commission of various torts,
it has not previously
granted injunctions to restrain the tort of negligence, but there appears to be
no reason why it should not
do so in an appropriate case, even without proof of
damage:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66</a>; Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity
Doctrines and Remedies (3rd ed, 1992), par 2120.  The power to grant
injunctions would appear,
since the fusion of law and equity, to extend to
granting injunctions in respect of all torts:  Parry v Crooks  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2027%20SASR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 27 SASR 1</a>,
per King CJ.</i>
<P>

<i>	Accordingly, if the plaintiffs are able to establish by evidence that the
failure by the department to permit their use of condoms
constitutes a breach
of duty of care it owes to them, they may be entitled to injunctive
relief."</i>
<P>

63	It is clear that if relief of the type sought is available to restrain the
commission of the tort of negligence the remedy would
involve the exercise of a
discretion, and a risk of harm to the plaintiff if proved should the relief be
refused is not the only
consideration that would arise in the exercise of such
a discretion.
<P>

64	To consider this ground it is necessary to examine the relevant evidence
more closely together with the statutory scheme under
which the intended
transfer would be implemented.
<P>

65	The plaintiff draws heavily on the evidence of Dr Nunn and Dr Chenoweth to
support this ground.  It is accurate to summarise
the effect of the evidence of
both doctors as being that each is of the opinion that the plaintiff's
interests would be better served
by his remaining at Worimi.  Plainly, Dr
Chenoweth has become firmer in that view with the passage of time,
notwithstanding the expressions
of opinion in the reports to which I have
earlier referred.
<P>

66	Dr Chenoweth said in evidence that when he wrote seemingly approving the
transfer, he did not consider the transfer to be in
the plaintiff's best
interest but regarded it as being inevitable.
<P>

67	Dr Chenoweth plainly considers that the plaintiff has been progressing
favourably at Worimi and that he should remain there.
 I draw on his affidavit
and oral evidence.  Dealing with the need for prolonged attachments to
therapists and caring figures, the
doctor said at paragraph 4 of his affidavit
of 19 August 1998:
<P>

	<i>"The general consensus is that prolonged attachment to therapists and
caring figures reliably assists in the connection of thinking
processes to the
emotional storms of the dissociative state.  References to this can be found in
a recent publication The Treatment
of Dissociative Disorders edited by
Professor Alexander McFarlane and Professor Essaul Van deKolk August 1995.
This treatment is
sometimes augmented by medications which [JMR] now has no
need of but which were essential in the early parts of his treatment. 
As he is
improving no variation over the next two years seems necessary.  Factors
influencing the likelihood of such treatments succeeding
include stability of
attachment figures first and foremost.  Successful treatment is defined in
terms of the ability of the patient
to be able to experience negative affect,
negative feelings, talk about same and not `space out' and respond in an
appropriate manner,
be it fight and flight, rage or panic.  It is unlikely that
a successful treatment goal will be achieved in only 2 to 5 years.  The
treatment will need to persist subsequently for many years.  As he is currently
making good progress I see no need to change the
treatment regimen.  My belief
is that he is gaining ground as opposed to simply maintaining his
condition."</i>
<P>

68	Further, as to the importance of attachment bonds, the doctor said in
paragraph 10:
<P>

	<i>"...acquisition of appropriate affect depends on attachment bonds made and
the maintenance of such connections.  Appropriate affect
means the ability to
respond appropriately at a feeling level to life's `ups and downs'.  [JMR] is
some distance towards acquiring
it.  Most of us are still working on this task.
He has come a great deal of distance.  The link between the attachment bonds
and
the appropriate affect centres on the generation of trust.  Trust firstly
that his needs will be met by others who care for him and
secondly trust that
whatever happens, he himself will be all right at some central core level.
[JMR's] security to be vulnerable
in the presence of others and his capacity to
trust others is still reasonably shaky."</i>
<P>

69	Dr Chenoweth addressed the risk of re-offending in paragraph 18:
<P>

	<i>"The most important factors likely to ensure [JMR] will not re-offend when
he is released are overwhelmingly to do with his ability
to express appropriate
affect.  Experts such as Associate Professor Warwick Middleton (University of
Queensland) state that the reclamation
of appropriate affect is central to the
management of people like [JMR].  If he has the ability to express himself
positively and
negatively in a mature and confident way he will not offend.
His offences, however horrendous, arose out of a deep sense of powerlessness,
provocation recurrent over a long period of time, immaturity and the
dissociative disconnection of appropriate affect consequent
upon horrendous
abuse.  At the moment I am reasonably confident that [JMR] will not re-offend
upon his release.  However, this could
be set back if he is placed in a
situation where he regresses to previous patterns of cognitive function.  The
most important factors
likely to ensure that he will not re-offend when
eventually released are overwhelmingly in the area of the acquisition of
appropriate
affect.  The assessment of dangerousness in a person like [JMR]
hinges on his ability to experience both positive and negative experiences,
to
be able to talk about them and respond appropriately.  I am reasonably
confident that he will not re-offend upon release as he
has come some distance
towards those goals.  This is still somewhat a fragile situation and should not
be jeopardised."</i>
<P>

70	In paragraph 19 Dr Chenoweth considered the importance of safety and
security in the plaintiff's environment:
<P>

	<i>"Dr Nunn, Dr Miller and myself refer to the maintenance of safety and
security as the primary influence of [JMR's] psychological and
emotional well
being.  This single factor is so important as it involves external limits being
placed on his behaviour and the development
through that of internal
limit-setting.  The length of time taken by this process is obviously variable.
Some of the indicators that
tell us when such a person no longer requires this
attention to safety include the ability to handle negative and stressful
situations
appropriately, to discuss painful and emotionally evocative issues
with the expression of appropriate feeling and the ability to
get on with the
normal milestones of adolescent maturation (ie academically, psychologically,
emotionally and physically).  If this
sense of safety is missing, it would be
highly likely that [JMR] would regress to familiar and previous ways of coping.
It is not
sufficient to ensure that no abuse actually occurs.  Rather it is
essential that his perception of safety is maintained, that his
contact with
his schooling, that a sense of academic achievement be preserved, that a sense
of familiarity and trust within his milieu
be maintained and that his part in
the culture of the Worimi institution be consolidated."</i>
<P>

71	Dr Chenoweth addressed the significance of the exposure to increased risk of
sexual assault in paragraphs 24 and 25:
<P>

	<i>"For [JMR], exposure to an increased risk of sexual assault would be
extremely detrimental to his emotional and psychological well-being.
 Even
being strip-searched on return from leave currently causes him great anxiety.
The containment, the layout and the high levels
of surveillance within Worimi
have contributed greatly to his own perception of safety from sexual assault.
Whilst in Worimi he also
has developed relationships with many of the staff
members which has also added to his sense of safety.  His perception has not
been
threatened at any point other than at the times of strip-search at return
from leave.  His responses at those times were those of
great anxiety.</i>
<P>

<i>	I think that Worimi can ensure [JMR's] recovery to the point of relative
safety in the community.  He can certainly achieve re-integration
in an
environment which will foster his health, self-respect and dignity.  I am
uncertain about what is available at Mt Penang. 
The photo that I have seen of
the dormitory does not fill me with optimism."</i>
<P>

72	In cross examination Dr Chenoweth acknowledged the need to attach weight to
the views of those who have had responsibility for
the plaintiff's control.
The doctor was asked these questions and gave these answers (T12):
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Can I suggest to you that the plaintiff had to move on and has had to
continuously move on since he first came into care?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  He has and is doing extraordinarily well.  He has academically come
ahead enormously, from a position as being treated as intellectually
retarded,
to the point where he is a long way down the track towards his year 12 and
getting very very good results.  A certain trust
in himself is
developing.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What I want to suggest to you is that those who have responsibility for
his care, custody and control, have done very well?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, very very well.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Their views should be given weight as to what is now appropriate with
respect to readying the plaintiff for eventual release?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  For me the issue was, does one treat him as a normal lad and move on in
a normal kind of way, through the system, or are there
special provisions made,
given that psychiatrically, this lad is quite unusual, quite unusual in the
degree of his disintegrated
control of emotional life.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  I think my question to you doctor was, would you agree that those that
have his care, custody and control, on their past record
in looking after the
boy, their views as to what should be done with respect to his future care,
custody and control, should be given
weight?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, I agree."</i>
<P>

73	Dr Nunn gave evidence (T24):
<P>

	<i>"I think it has to be said that that is the open question from a therapist
point of view, can he be rehabilitated, and therefore the
possibility of, of
titrating the environment against his capacity to cope with that environment in
a controlled, predictable and
assessable way, is critical."</i>
<P>

74	It is the belief of Dr Nunn, shared by Dr Chenoweth, that training in
psychiatry is necessary to equip the decision-maker with
the expertise to
assess the reasons for a change in the plaintiff's environment.
<P>

75	Ms Moen submitted that the effect of the medical evidence is that a transfer
to Mt Penang would expose the plaintiff to very
significant triggers of stress
including the fear of sexual assault and that deterioration in the plaintiff's
mental condition is
likely if the transfer takes place.  I am not persuaded
that the evidence warrants a finding of likelihood of harm attendant upon
transfer.  Certainly there would be a risk of harm and probably a greater risk
than at Worimi.  However that is not the only matter
to be considered.
<P>

76	Ms Johnston gave evidence, taking into account all the evidence of Dr
Chenoweth and Dr Nunn, that her opinion as to the desirability
for transfer and
for the plaintiff's removal from the "comfort zone" at Worimi remained
unchanged.  Ms Johnston sees advantages to
the plaintiff in the environmental
change at Mt Penang and in the change of support staff.  Her evidence at T34-35
was as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Worimi general justice centre is a very small and close centre.  It is no
large open spaces.  It has no grass.  It has what we call
a building perimeter.
Therefore it has no fences around it and the building is closed in by other
buildings, commercial buildings
on a block side by side.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is no open spaces.  It is quite enclosed.  It has limited group work
and therapy rooms available.  It does not have an appropriate
visiting area for
family contact.  A lot of areas for young people would be in groups or contact
with their visitors are thoroughfares
to other areas of the centre.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mt Penang, on the other hand, is a large, open centre.  It also does not
have a perimeter fence.  It has got large pastures and it
is a semi rural
setting.  It certainly has a range of programme areas, vocational training
areas in addition to a much larger school
area which is located on the
periphery of the property, where it can be quite separate from the rest of the
centre.  It obviously
has larger and more school facilities.</i>
<P>

<i>	So there is vast differences there in the physical environment, support
people.  I think I agree with Dr Chenoweth that the connection
that [JMR] has
made with people in Worimi and the trust he has been able to develop and the
safety that he has a sense of now is
a very positive thing and it certainly has
helped his development and his ability to respond to people in a way we would
want him
to respond.</i>
<P>

<i>	The change in support people, it is - the issue is about providing him with
the opportunity to do that again with a new group of
people, what he has done
at Worimi, and to learn that wherever he goes in his life he can establish that
trust and have that sense
of safety and sense of security.  When he returns to
the community he can have more faith.  If he is not to move and remain at
Worimi,
yes, he will continue the trust.  The trust will continue to build his
sense of safety, will be there, but he will go directly from
there into the
wider community and not be with those whom he has established such trust and
safety and go into the wider community.</i>
<P>

<i>	He is not going to be under juvenile justice supervision when he released
and I have concerns about that.  I would like him to learn
the experiences he
has had at Worimi.  He can have them in another setting, another juvenile
justice setting, which means we are
still around to help him through that and
then he can go into the community, having known that he can find that security
with a variety
of people."</i>
<P>

77	Later the witness responded to a question in cross examination at T48:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Dr Chenoweth and Dr Nunn's assessment of [JMR] are that significant
strong positive trusting relationships are assisting his
responses in a
situation that he might ordinarily be violent in?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  In this particular case I would then class significant positive
relationships as a key indicator of his suitability for release
on parole, in
that we should be able to demonstrate his ability to form and maintain
relationships with a wide range of people, in
a wide range of settings.
Because of the concerns about [JMR] initiating these relationships and having
the sense of trust, there
should be a graduated increase in the types of
relationships that he has whilst still having support.  The idea behind the
move to
Mount Penang is that the Juvenile Justice Centre staff will still be
there in a supporting role to help him establish those relationships
and to
help him maintain them."</i>
<P>

78	There is another consideration regarded as fundamental by Ms Johnston
concerning this plaintiff and that is the need to assess
before the plaintiff
is admitted to parole the risk that he may re-offend.  At T60 the witness was
asked the following questions
and gave the following answers:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  Do you accept then, that the treatment of the plaintiff's dissociative
problem, is fundamental to ensuring his safe release?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Regardless of the reason, the plaintiff is a serious violent offender,
therefore the reason for offending and the offending need
to be the focus of
work whilst he is in custody and during the post release period under parole
supervision and once supervision
has ended.  The graduated exposure to the
community will serve both those purposes.  The experience of a variety of
positives and
negatives are experiences, it has been reported, will help in the
acquisition of appropriate affect."</i>
<P>

79	Later at T77 the witness was asked these questions and gave these
answers:
<P>

	<i>"Q.  You heard Dr Nunn say yesterday that it was still an open question as
to whether the plaintiff could be rehabilitated, do you
recall that?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes, I do.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  What do you say as to the appropriateness or otherwise of Worimi as
opposed to Mt Penang in making a judgment as to whether that
had been achieved
with the plaintiff at the time of the expiry of his non parole period?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  It's been reported that the assessment of dangerousness and the
likelihood of re-offending is based upon the plaintiff's ability
to experience
positive and negative experiences, be able to reflect on those and maybe the
appropriate responses.  The ability to
assess that in Mt Penang is far greater
because of the variety of those experiences.  In the Worimi environment, at
this point, because
of familiarity in the environment, in the relationships,
positive experiences outweigh negative experiences."</i>
<P>

80	Ms Johnston made it plain in her evidence that she would have difficulty in
making a recommendation as to parole for the plaintiff
if he was to remain at
Worimi, perceiving that he needs to show an ability to adjust in the wider
environment than can be afforded
at Mt Penang.  The evidence of the second
defendant to that effect has particular relevance against the provisions of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Detention Centres) Act, 1987</a></i>, one of the expressed objects of
which is to ensure that <i>"persons subject to control take their places in the
community as soon as possible as persons who will observe the law"</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
4(1)(a)).</a>
<P>

81	It is not practicable to review in this judgment the detail of all the
evidence referable to the ground in point.  I do not overlook
evidence that the
defendant will continue to fund the services of Dr Chenoweth as the plaintiff's
treating doctor in the event of
the transfer to Mt Penang going ahead.  I am
also mindful of the evidence as to the other services that will be available to
the
plaintiff at Mt Penang and the opportunities that will exist for the
formation of valuable attachments.  The plaintiff will have
the opportunity of
association with various categories of staff at Mt Penang, including the
psychologists, the counsellors, the case
workers, the nursing staff, the
vocational service instructors, the chaplains, and the recreational staff.  The
opportunity will,
of course, also exist for the plaintiff to form friendships
with the other inmates who have been selected for detention at Karinya
because
of their positive attitudes towards rehabilitation and the other worthy
attributes identified by Mr Gould in his affidavit.
<P>

82	I also bear in mind the evidence of Ms Johnston that the second defendant
will provide for the transport of the grandparents
to Mt Penang for regular
visits, weekly to begin with, and later on a fortnightly basis on the
understanding that the grandparents
should be able to find assistance from
friends or relatives to permit them to visit more frequently than fortnightly.

<P>

83	It seems to me that it is altogether reasonable and appropriate that the
plaintiff should be exposed to the wider environment
at Mt Penang before his
suitability for parole can be more properly assessed.  It seems to me further
to be altogether reasonable
and appropriate and important to assess the
potential danger the plaintiff may pose to the community following his ultimate
release
against the background of his broader experience at Mt Penang.
<P>

84	I have concluded therefore that I am not satisfied that apprehended breach
of the defendants' duty of care to the plaintiff in
the event of the transfer
proceeding has been established.  It follows that this ground advanced by the
plaintiff also fails.
<P>

85	Ms Moen finally advanced a submission, not in the points of claim, that if
the Court was not persuaded that relief should be
granted on one or other of
the bases claimed, it should nevertheless grant an injunction to restrain the
transfer until risk factors
attendant upon such transfer have been adequately
considered by a psychiatrist.  Ms Anderson opposed consideration of such relief
upon the ground that it had not been sought in the points of claim and that no
opportunity was provided for the defendants to assess
it since the ground for
relief was expressed orally at the end of Ms Moen's submissions in reply.
<P>

86	I do not consider it would be appropriate to act on the submission last
expressed by Ms Moen and of course Ms Johnston has considered
the evidence of
both psychiatrists upon whom the plaintiff relied.  The defendants could not be
compelled to act only on those expressions
of psychiatric opinion against the
transfer and yet not be able to take into account those expressions of
psychiatric evidence that
are available which offer some support for the
transfer.
<P>

87	For the reasons I have stated the summons is dismissed.  Costs are
reserved.
