<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>This matter comes before the Court as a case
stated by Ms Pat O'Shane, Local Court Magistrate.  There are, in fact, three
matters.
 They arise out of the same incident.  They were heard together (s
78A(2) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act, 1902</a>).  The informations were, in each case, dismissed.
The informant appeals against that dismissal.
<P>

<b>Background to the Incident</b>
<P>

2  	Attached to the case stated is the transcript of the proceedings
before the Local Court.  I have been invited by both parties
to have regard to
that transcript.
<P>

3  	In 1997 work began upon the Eastern Distributor, a Freeway
linking the city with the airport.  The road included a section of
tunnel.  An
area known as the "Drivers Triangle" was set aside to construct the tunnel
entrance.  The land within the Drivers Triangle
(and, one infers, part of the
Freeway itself) was public parkland.  It was held by the Centennial and Moore
Park Trust.  The Trust
licensed the Road Traffic Authority to use certain land
(including the Drivers Triangle) to construct the road.  The Road Traffic
Authority, in its turn, authorised a company (which was to manage the Freeway)
to retain contractors to undertake the construction.
<P>

4  	The contractors (Leighton Contractors) began work.  A cyclone
fence eight feet high was erected around the perimeter of the
Drivers Triangle.
Barbed wire was placed on top of the fence.  Access to the area was by means of
a gate, which was locked.  There
were a number of signs displayed on the
fencing, and the gate.  One sign read:
<P>

<center>"No unauthorised personnel
<P>

Construction site"</center>
<P>


<P>

5  	Another sign carried the same message:
<P>

<center>"No pedestrian access"</center>
<P>


<P>

6  	Heavy equipment, including a crane, was moved into the Drivers
Triangle.  When work was not taking place, a security guard maintained
watch
over the area.
<P>

<b>The Incident Itself</b>
<P>

7  	On 28 September 1997, Mr Walter Hufschmid began his shift as
security officer on the site at 7.00 pm.  It was part of his duty
to patrol the
fence throughout the night.  His shift was due to end at 6.00 am on 29
September 1997.  On his 5.00 am patrol the fence
was intact.  However, at 5.40
am he noticed four persons (a child, and the three defendants) had gained
access to the area.  When
he investigated he found that a section of the fence
had been pulled apart.  One of the defendants was sitting on the cabin of the
crane.  The other two (and the child) had attached themselves, by means of
chains and piping, to the raised jib of the crane.
<P>

8  	The lengths of piping were designed to make it difficult to
remove the defendants once they had been secured to an object. 
The piping
prevented ready access to the locking mechanism by which they had been secured.
Ultimately, the piping was removed by
the Police Rescue Squad some hours after
the defendants had first been noticed.
<P>

9  	The defendants were then arrested.  They were each charged with
an offence under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands Protection Act, 1901</a>.  The charge against
one defendant was in these terms:
<P>

"That Jurgen Wille on the 29th day of September 1997, at Surry Hills in the
State of New South Wales, without lawful excuse did
enter into the inclosed
lands of another person, situate at the Eastern Distributor Construction Site,
Drivers Triangle, without
the consent of the person apparently in charge of the
same, Mr Walter Hufschmid."
<P>

10  	The charges against the other defendants were in the same
terms.
<P>

<b>The Proceedings Before the Local Court</b>
<P>

11  	The cases were fought on one issue.  The defendants asserted
that their entry upon the "inclosed land", without the consent
of the person in
charge, was with lawful excuse.  One defendant, Mr Bartlett, identified that
excuse in these words:  (T 21/22)
<P>

"A.	My lawful excuse was that I was making a protest to the eastern
distributor, building of the eastern distributor and the destruction
of Moore
Park."
<P>

12  	The case stated included the following:
<P>

"d)	The Defendants were voicing protests about the building of the eastern
distributor motorway, the destruction of trees in Moore
Park and the loss of
part of Moore Park as public recreation land.  The protests were in front of a
number of film crews and a large
number of photographers outside the fence,
adjacent to the crane.  This was acknowledged by Constable Morgan in his
evidence.
<P>

e)	There was no evidence presented by the prosecution and none from which it
could be inferred that the Defendants entered on the
subject land for any
criminal purpose."
<P>

13  	The learned Magistrate identified the grounds upon which she
made her determination in these words:
<P>

"I accepted the defence submission that the Defendant had a right to protest
peacefully.  I held that in the absence of evidence
of a criminal intent by the
Defendant at the time of entering the inclosed land of another, the exercise of
that right to protest
upon inclosed land of another constituted a lawful excuse
within the meaning of s4(1) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1961.
 I
therefore dismissed the information."
<P>

<b>The Offence</b>
<P>

14  	Section 4(1) of the Inclosed Land Protection Act, 1901, creates
two offences, one being an offence of entering into inclosed
lands without
lawful excuse, and the other being remaining upon such lands (without lawful
excuse) when asked to leave (Finlay J,
<b><i>Black v Carrabs </i></b>[1988] 9
PSR 4045).  The section creating the offence is, relevantly, in these terms:
<P>

"4(1)	Any person who, without lawful excuse, enters into the inclosed lands of
any other person, without the consent of the owner
or occupier thereof, or the
person apparently in charge of the same ... shall be liable to a penalty not
exceeding 5 penalty units,
and the proof of such lawful excuse shall be upon
the defendant in any such case."
<P>

<b>Without Lawful Excuse</b>
<P>

15  	The case turns upon the meaning of the phrase "without lawful
excuse".  The statute is concerned with criminal trespass.  The
purpose of the
Act is identified in the opening words, which are as follows:
<P>

"An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to the protection of inclosed
lands from intrusion and trespass."
<P>

16  	The antiquity of the statute, which was a consolidating Act
passed in 1901, can be seen, not only from the spelling of the
"inclosed", but
from the meaning given to the words "lawful excuse".  It appears in s4(1), and
is in these terms:
<P>

"Without prejudice to the generality of the expression `lawful excuse' a drover
or person in charge of stock being driven upon a
road lawfully inclosed with
the lands of any person shall be deemed to have lawful excuse for entering such
lands for the purpose
of preventing the stock from straying or regaining
control of stock which have strayed from such road."
<P>

17  	The Privy Council (although in a somewhat different context) in
<b><i>Wong Pooh Yin v Public Prosecutor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1955%5d%20AC%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1955] AC 93</a> said this:  (at
100)
<P>

"Their Lordships doubt if it is possible to define the expression `lawful
excuse' in a comprehensive and satisfactory manner and
they do not propose to
make the attempt.  They agree with the Court of Appeal that it would be
undesirable to do so and that each
case requires to be examined on its
individual facts."
<P>

18  	In determining the meaning to be given to the words "without
lawful excuse" only limited assistance is to be obtained from
cases which
construe phrases which are superficially similar, such as "without reasonable
excuse" (<b><i>Mark &amp; Anor v Henshaw</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20155%20ALR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 155 ALR 118)</a> or "for a
lawful purpose" (<b><i>Taikato v Regina</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 454).</a>
<P>

19  	Of greater assistance, in my view, is the law surrounding the
companion tort, that is the tort of trespass.  The tort of trespass
does not
require proof of damage. In this respect it differs from an action on the case.
The tort was developed to protect a person's
land from physical intrusion.
Having proved entry, it was for the defendant to "justify" or "excuse" his
conduct (Fleming, <u>The Law of Torts</u> (9th Edition) p 83).  Various
defences were recognised which would "excuse" trespass.  Fleming, and other
authors, have catalogued
such defences under various headings, including:
<P>

&#183;	Inevitable accident (as opposed to mistake).
<P>

&#183;	Consent.
<P>

&#183;	Incapacity.
<P>

&#183;	Necessity.
<P>

&#183;	A limited right to recapture chattels on another's land.
<P>

&#183;	Entry under legal authority (such as a warrant, or authorisation by
statute).
<P>

(Fleming, ch 5, pp 83-109;  <u>Street on Torts</u> (8th Ed) ch 6, p 74 ff;
Halsburys <u>Laws of Australia</u> vol 26 Title 415 (Tort), para 415-525 ff;
<u>The Laws of Australia</u> ch 33 at 33.9)
<P>

20  	Mistake, as such, was no defence.  The defendant was liable,
even if he believed that he was on his own land.
<P>

21  	The criminal law of trespass ameliorated the harshness of that
rule.  It recognised mistake as a lawful excuse.  In <b><i>Ex Parte
Desmond</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1866%5d%205%20SCR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1866] 5 SCR 387</a>, Stephen CJ said this:  (at 389)
<P>

"...  for the entry on land, in the <i>bona fide</i> exercise of a claim of
right, well or ill founded, if only it be honestly made, is clearly
excusable."
<P>

22  	In <b><i>Crafter v  O'Reilly </i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAStRp/1934/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] SAStRp 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1934%5d%20SASR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1934] SASR 20</a>, Murray CJ
said this:  (at 24)
<P>

"Mistake of law can never be pleaded, but an honest and reasonable belief in
the existence of a state of facts which, if true, would
make the act charged
against the accused innocent would, I think, be a sufficient defence."
<P>

23  	His Honour gave a number of illustrations, including:
<P>

"Thus, if it can be shewn that he was in such a mental state from disease or
otherwise that he was not responsible for his actions,
or that he was forcibly
taken to the house by some other person and left there in a helpless condition,
or that he entered the house
in the honest and reasonable belief that the house
was his own dwelling, and that he was discovered before he found out his
mistake,
there would, in my judgment, be an answer to the charge."
<P>

24  	In <b><i>Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2
NSWLR 497</a>, Hunt J said this:  (at 501/502)
<P>

"I am satisfied that a very real distinction exists between `reasonable excuse'
and `lawful excuse' .... section 4 therefore requires
the defendant to
establish mistake, rather than the prosecution to disprove it:  cf
<i>Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1935%5d%20AC%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1935] AC 462</a>, at 481;
<i>Spautz v Williams</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20NSWLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 NSWLR 506.</a>  But s 4 does not permit such
lawful excuse to be proved by establishing a reasonable but mistaken belief
that he had a right to
enter the premises unless the circumstances which he
believes to be true would, if in fact true, give him such a right to enter
them.
 Thus, a belief that a friend who had invited him to call lived in the
premises would amount to lawful excuse if he entered the wrong
premises.  But
if the facts believed to be true would not, if in fact true, give him a right
to enter the premises, then there is
no lawful excuse available under s 4."
<P>

25  	Here the actions of the defendants were quite deliberate.  They
knew the land was enclosed land.  They knew they had no permission
to enter the
land.  They, no doubt, appreciated (although this aspect was not investigated)
that, had they sought permission, that
permission would have been denied
them.
<P>

26  	However, at the urging of the parties the Local Court Magistrate
did not deal with the circumstances of entry, although plainly
they were
relevant.  Rather, she focused upon the purpose of the defendants once they
were upon the land.  The purpose was, in each
case, to peacefully protest.
Peaceful protest is not unlawful.  Hence, the trespass was not one "without
lawful excuse".
<P>

<b>The Relevance of Purpose</b>
<P>

27  	Defendants, in a number of prosecutions, have sought to excuse
their intrusion upon another's land by reference to their ultimate
purpose.  In
<b><i>Morris v Darby</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1936%5d%2053%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1936] 53 WN (NSW) 136</a>, the defendants were
employed as inquiry agents to obtain evidence in divorce proceedings.  The
issue was defined by Owen AJ in these
terms:  (at 136)
<P>

"The question raised is whether a person, who <i>bona fide</i> believes that he
will be able to obtain evidence for use in divorce proceedings and enters
enclosed lands without the consent of
the owner or occupier thereof for the
purpose of obtaining such evidence, is entitled to set up that he had `lawful
excuse' for such
entry within the meaning of s 4 of the Act."
<P>

28  	His Honour, without elaboration, stated his opinion in these
terms:
<P>

"I think that an entry upon land by a private detective or anybody else against
the consent of the owner or occupier of the land
in order to obtain evidence in
connection with civil proceedings, even if the person charged has a <i>bona
fide </i>belief that he will obtain such evidence if he does enter the
premises, is an entry `without lawful excuse' within the meaning of
s 4."
<P>

29  	In <b><i>Wills v Williams</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20WAR%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] WAR 29</a>, Virtue SPJ, in
the Supreme Court of Western Australia, made the following comment on a section
of the Western Australia Police Act
which, in the circumstances of criminal
trespass, entitled the Court to declare someone a "rogue and vagabond":  (at
32)
<P>

"It is a criminal section and in this subsection the burden of proof is placed
upon any person found on the premises:  That person
must show that his presence
was not for any criminal purpose.  If he does that his trespass is excused not
merely because he had
any right or any belief in any right, though that would
be sufficient, but simply by the absence of any wrong intention.  This excuse
is lawful because he is honest and therefore he is not to be treated as a
criminal."
<P>

30  	The findings, and judgment of the Local Court in this matter,
reflect that approach.
<P>

31  	Shortly after that decision, the same issue came before the Full
Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in <b><i>Hancock v
Birsa</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20WAR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] WAR 177.</a>  Burt J made the following statement with which I
respectfully agree:  (at 181)
<P>

"... the first step in the reasoning would appear to equate the idea conveyed
by the words `without lawful excuse' with the idea
of `unlawful purpose', so
requiring one to say that the absence of proof of an unlawful purpose prevents
one from finding the absence
of lawful excuse.  In my opinion, this is not so.
Proof of an unlawful purpose no doubt denies a lawful excuse.  But the converse
is not, I think, true.  Proof of the absence of a lawful excuse does not
require the finding of an unlawful in the sense of a criminal
purpose.  What it
does require, and in my opinion all that it requires, is a judgment by the
Court as to `whether the defendant's
presence on the premises is excusable in
all the circumstances of the case ...'"
<P>

32  	In the same case, however, Hale J offered the opinion that
"without lawful excuse" was a compendious expression meaning "without
an excuse
which would appear to a reasonable man to be adequate in the circumstances" (at
179).
<P>

33  	In <b><i>Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic</i></b>, the
defendant advanced as the "lawful excuse' for his trespass upon a private
hospital, that he bona fide believed, on reasonable
grounds, that unlawful
abortions were being carried out upon such premises.  Hunt J considered whether
entry upon a person's land
for such a purpose may provide the defendant with a
lawful excuse:  (at 502)
<P>

"Assuming that his apparent belief that therapeutic abortions are unlawful is
genuine - despite all the legal authority to the contrary
- and that there were
therefore unlawful activities being carried out on the premises, the existence
of that circumstance would give
him no right at all to enter the premises.
...
<P>

Not even a policeman can enter premises for that purpose without a warrant."
<P>

34  	In <b><i>Minkley v Monroe</i></b> [1986] 8 PSR 3975 the
defendant was a TV journalist.  He quite deliberately entered enclosed lands at
the aviation fuel installation
at Kingsford Smith Airport.  He was dressed as a
Caltex employee.  He did so in order to demonstrate the deficiencies in the
security
arrangements at that installation.  He had no criminal purpose.  The
issue was whether, within the terms of s 4(1), he had a "lawful
excuse".  The
Magistrate in the Local Court, following Hale J in <b><i>Hancock v
Birsa</i></b>, found that the defendant had an excuse which appeared to be
adequate in the circumstances.  He, therefore, dismissed the information.
<P>

35  	Grove J rejected that approach.  He made the following statement
with which I respectfully agree:  (at 3975)
<P>

"Such facts would result in an accused being able to say `I am aware that I had
no right to be there;  I deliberately broke the
close;  nevertheless because,
once I got there, I did not intend to do anything unlawful I therefore have no
unlawful purpose.  This
is equivalent to a lawful excuse and my deliberate
trespass must therefore go unpunished.'  I reject such hypothesis."
<P>

36  	Grove J added:  (at 3981)
<P>

"I do not accept that `reasonable excuse' is a coterminous expression with
`lawful excuse' and I would construe the latter compatibly
with <i>Darcey</i>,
and hold that a lawful excuse cannot be proved upon the postulation of
circumstances which would, if in fact true, give a right
to the entrant to be
present within the close.  The reasonable but mistaken belief is thus
comprehended."
<P>

<b>Application of these Principles</b>
<P>

37  	In each of these cases, entry upon the land was necessary in
order to accomplish the purpose, which was then put forward as
the lawful
excuse.  <b><i>Morris v Darby</i></b> (the attempt to obtain evidence for
divorce proceedings), <b><i>Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic</i></b> (the
attempt to obtain evidence of illegal abortion), and <b><i>Minkley v
Monroe</i></b> (the need for the journalist to demonstrate the absence of
security), are all cases where the person charged was obliged to trespass
in
order to fulfil the purpose.  The fulfilment of that purpose, however, was not
a lawful excuse.  The fact that their ultimate
purpose was not criminal did not
make the trespass excusable.  In none of these cases did the defendant have a
right to enter the
premises in order to accomplish his purpose.
<P>

38  	Applying these principles, it can be seen, with respect, that
the Local Court was wrong.  First, unlike the examples just given,
entry to the
premises by these defendants was not necessary to accomplish their purpose.
Their purpose was to show their opposition
to the proposed road.  They could
have protested outside the perimeter fence.  Such a protest may not have been
as dramatic, but
that cannot matter.  Were it otherwise, a person could invade
another's property because their purpose might be better accomplished
in that
location rather than elsewhere.  Upon that basis someone would be entitled to
enter inclosed land, publicly or privately
held, to sunbathe, or hold a dinner
party, because they preferred that location to another area, not enclosed.
<P>

39  	Secondly, the person who entered the land, in each of the cases
referred to, did not have a criminal purpose.  That, however,
is not
determinative, although it is relevant.  Effecting entry itself may involve a
crime (such as malicious damage to the fence).
 It would obviously be relevant
for the prosecution to prove that the defendants had committed a crime in
gaining entry, or intended
to commit a crime once on the premises.  In either
case, and certainly in the latter case, it is difficult to see how a person who
entered in such circumstances could assert that they had a lawful excuse.  It
is possible, perhaps, to imagine circumstances of necessity
where beyond the
fence there is a person in distress, such that damage to the fence, and entry,
is necessary to alleviate that distress.
 Damage to the fence in such
circumstances would not be malicious.  Such person, in any event, would have
lawful excuse for entry
(cf the defence of necessity).
<P>

40  	Returning to the present matter, the local Magistrate identified
the purpose (peaceful protest), and the fact that it was not
criminal, and
determined the matter upon that basis.  The issue was, however, whether that
purpose <b>in that location</b> (on another's "inclosed land") was a lawful
excuse.  That question has not been addressed.  In my view, the limits of those
excuses
which may be characterised as lawful excuses for the purposes of s 4(1)
of the Act, are to be found by analogy to the categories
which apply in civil
trespass, supplemented by honest and reasonable mistake, where the facts
assumed would, if true, give a right
of entry.
<P>

<b>Order</b>
<P>

41  	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I allow the appeal.
<P>

2.	I hold that the determination by the Local Court Magistrate was erroneous in
point of law.
<P>

3.	I remit the three matters to the Local Court to determine according to
law.
<P>

4.	I order the respondents before me to pay the appellant's costs.  They
should, however, in each case, have a certificate under
the Suitors Fund
Act.
