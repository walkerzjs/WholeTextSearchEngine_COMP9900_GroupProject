<P>

<b>1747/96	LEICESTER DENIS RAMSEY &amp; ORS   -v-   JUANITA KAY VOGLER &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   On 26 February 1999 Bryson J delivered his
reserved judgment.  The orders of his Honour included the following:
<P>

1.	Give judgment for the first plaintiff, Leicester Denis Ramsey, against the
second defendant, John Davies, for damages and interest
to be assessed;
<P>

2.	Order that an enquiry be held before a Master to ascertain and further
assess the amount of damages and interest for which judgment
be entered and
direct that judgment be entered in accordance with the Master's certificate.
<P>

2   	The matter has come before me consequent upon order 2 made
by his Honour.  The proceedings in which his Honour made those orders
were
proceedings in which his Honour found for the first plaintiff against the
second defendant in an action in deceit.
<P>

3   	His Honour expressly held that the charge of fraud asserted
against the second defendant, in particular, paragraph 12(b) in
the statement
of claim, had been established.  The action arose out of the first plaintiff
being induced by the fraudulent assertions
of the second defendant to acquire a
business.  The business was worthless.  The first plaintiff not merely made no
profit from it,
but suffered a very considerable loss as a result of the
transaction.
<P>

4   	The measure of damages for an action in deceit arising out
of fraudulent misrepresentation is referred to in McGregor on Damages
(15 ed.,
1998), chapter 39.  That chapter clearly distinguishes between the measure of
damages in the tort of deceit and the measure
of damages based on principles of
contract where there has been some form of fraudulent conduct on the part of
the party held to
be liable.
<P>

5   	In the instant case there is no issue between the parties
that the cause of action upon which his Honour found that the second
defendant
was liable to the first plaintiff was grounded upon the tort of deceit.  The
measure of damages in respect of such tort
has been the subject of several
decisions of the High Court of Australia.  In <i>Holmes v Jones </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%204%20CLR%201692" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 4
CLR 1692</a> the  Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith referred to the submission
which had been made before the court at the hearing of that case
in reliance
upon two American authorities in support of the submission that in an action
for fraudulent misrepresentation the plaintiff
was entitled to recover damages
upon the same measure as in an action for breach of warranty.  His Honour
expressed the view that
that was not the law and referred to the authorities of
<i>Broome v Speak </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1903%5d%201%20Ch%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1903] 1 Ch 586</a> at 605 (which decision was affirmed by
the House of Lords under the name <i>Shepheard v Broome </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%20AC%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] AC 342)</a> and
<i>Waddell v Blockey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20QBD%20678" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">4 QBD 678.</a>
<P>

6   	The <i>locus classicus </i>of the law in Australia has been
the judgment of Dixon J (as he then was) in <i>Toteff v Antonas </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1952/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1952] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%2087%20CLR%20647" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 87
CLR 647.</a>  His Honour said at 650: 
<P>

In an action of deceit a plaintiff is entitled to recover as damages a sum
representing the prejudice or disadvantage he has suffered
in consequence of
his altering his position under the inducement of the fraudulent
misrepresentations made by the defendant.  When
what he has been induced to do
is to make a purchase from the defendant and part with his money to him in
payment of the price, then,
if the transaction stands and is not disaffirmed or
rescinded, what is recoverable is "the difference between the real value of the
property, and the sum which the plaintiff was induced to give for it" per
Abbott LCJ <i>Pearson v Wheeler </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281825%29%20171%20ER%201028" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1825) 171 ER 1028</a> at 1029. As Sir James
Hammond P in <i>Peek v Derry </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2037%20Ch%20D%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 37 Ch D 541</a> at 594 pointed out, the
question is how much worse off is the plaintiff than if he had not entered into
the transaction.  If he had
not done so he would have had the purchase money in
his pocket.  To ascertain his loss you must deduct from the amount he paid the
real value of the thing he got.
<P>

7   	In the same case, Williams J said at 553:
<P>

The contract was a contract for the sale of the business as a going concern.
The representations related to takings and profits
the plaintiff might
reasonably expect to make out of the business if he purchased it on this
basis.
<P>

8   	The damages that the plaintiff would suffer if the
representations were untrue was the difference between the real market value
of
the business as a going concern and the price the plaintiff paid for the
business.
<P>

9   	I have also been taken to the decision of the High Court of
Australia in <i>Gould v Vaggelas </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 215.</a>  Gibbs CJ said at
220:
<P>

It is well established that in an action of deceit where the plaintiff has been
induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation of the
defendant to enter into a
contract of purchase, the measure of damages usually applicable is the
difference between the real value
of the property at the time of the purchase
and what the plaintiff paid for it. 
<P>

10   	His Honour referred to the decisions in <i>Holmes v
Jones</i> and <i>Toteff v Antonas</i> from which I have already quoted.  
<P>

11   	The decision of the High Court of Australia in <i>Gates v
City Mutual Life Assurance Pty Ltd </i>(1986) 160 CLR 1 related to the measure
of damages and the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>, in particular section 52(1) of
that Act.
<P>

12   	In a joint judgment Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ adverted
to the fact that the Act does not prescribe the measure of damages
recoverable
by a plaintiff for contravention of the provisions of Parts 4 and 5.
<P>

13   	Their Honours then contrasted the measure of damages in an
action in deceit and the measure of damages for breach of warranty.
 At 12
their Honours said:
<P>

The differences and the similarities between the two approaches are best
illustrated by contrasting the damages recoverable for
breach of contractual
warranty on a purchase of goods with those recoverable for a fraudulent
misrepresentation inducing entry into
a contract for the purchase of goods on
the assumption that the contracts are identical except that in one case the
representation
amounts to a warranty and in the other it is merely a
non-contractual representation.  For breach of warranty the plaintiff is prima
facie entitled to recover the difference between the real value of the goods,
and the value of the goods as warranted.  In deceit
the measure of damages is
the difference at the time of purchase between the real value of the goods, and
the price paid.
<P>

14   	Their Honours referred to <i>Potts v Miller </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1940/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2064%20CLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 64
CLR 282</a> at 289-297 and to the decisions from which I have already quoted,
<i>Toteff v Antonas </i>and <i>Gould v Vaggelas</i>.
<P>

But this has been treated as a prima facie measure only, the true measure being
reflected in the proposition stated by Dixon J in
<i>Toteff v Antonas </i>in
these terms:
<P>

and their Honours then quoted the passage I have already quoted within that
case.
<P>

15   	At p 13 their Honours said:
<P>

Because the object of damages in tort is to place the plaintiff in the position
in which he would have been but for the commission
of the tort, it is necessary
to determine what the plaintiff would have done had he not relied on the
representation.  If that reliance
has deprived him of the opportunity of
entering into a different contract for the purchase of goods on which he would
have made a
profit then he may recover that profit on the footing that it is
part of the loss which he has suffered in consequence of altering
his position
under the inducement of the representation.  This may well be so if the
plaintiff can establish that he could and would
have entered into the different
contract and that it would have yielded the benefit claimed <i>cf</i> <i>Esso
Petroleum Co Limited v Mardon </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1976/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] EWCA Civ 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20QB%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) QB 801</a> at 820-821, 828-829; <i>Doyle v
Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd </i>(1969) 2 QB at 167.  The lost benefit is referable
to opportunities foregone by reason of reliance on the misrepresentation.  In
this
respect the measure of damages in tort begins to resemble the expectation
element in the measure of damages in contract save that
it is for the plaintiff
to establish that he could and would have entered into the different
contract.
<P>

16   	It is clear from the foregoing cases that the usual rule
as to the measure of damages in an action of deceit such as the present
is the
difference between the real value of the property at the time of representation
and the value at the time of purchase.  That
is recognised by Gibbs CJ in
<i>Gould v Vaggelas </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 215</a> at 220.  That however is only a
special application of the general principle enunciated in <i>Toteff v Antonas
</i>by Dixon J at p 650 that:
<P>

In an action of deceit a plaintiff is entitled to recover as damages a sum
representing the prejudice or disadvantage he has suffered
in consequence of
his altering his position under the inducement of the fraudulent
misrepresentations made by the defendant.
<P>

17   	In the instant case the plaintiff at the time when he
first had contact with the second defendant had recently taken voluntary
redundancy from his employment as an executive with a subsidiary of the AMP
Society.  With the moneys which he received from that
voluntary redundancy he
decided to look for a business which could be conducted by himself and his wife
together.  They spent from
July 1994, when the first plaintiff ceased his
employment, until January 1995 looking for a suitable business for that
purpose. It
was in the latter part of January 1995 that the first plaintiff had
his first contact with the second defendant.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff has placed before the Court a document
headed "Schedule of Losses" which is annexure A to the affidavit of Romas
Polaitis sworn 29 March 1999.  Mr Polaitis is a registered public accountant.
He has sworn three affidavits in this matter.  Both
he and Mr Ramsey were
cross-examined at the instance of the second defendant.
<P>

19   	No evidence was placed before the Court by or on behalf of
the second defendant upon the present enquiry as to damages.
<P>

20   	The schedule of losses annexed to the affidavit of Mr
Polaitis consists of four separate items.  It was at the outset recognised
by
Mr King of Counsel, for the plaintiff, that item 1, headed "Loss of Expected
Profits" must be treated as an alternative to items
2, 3 and 4, in that the
plaintiff would not be entitled to obtain an award consisting of the losses of
expected profits and also
the various other items, since those other items were
necessarily incurred in achieving the expected profits.
<P>

21   	During the course of the hearing the plaintiff sought to
amend the schedule of losses by adding an alternative item to item
1, being
described as item 1A as follows, 
<P>

Alternatively, the sum of $423,000 being the difference in value between the
business as represented and the business as sold.
<P>

22   	The basis of the calculation of $423,000, which is a very
substantial component in the $447,165 appearing in item 1, is that
the figure
of $141,000 as an expected operating profit has been adopted by Mr Polaitis and
since that figure could be regarded as
a factor, indeed the only factor, in
calculating the goodwill of the business and since, according to Mr Polaitis,
goodwill is usually
calculated for a period of between one and six years, he
adopted a period of three years.  Therefore the amount of $423,000 is
calculated
as the multiple of three for the projected annual profit of
$141,000.
<P>

23   	That projected annual profit of $141,000 was the
substantial fraudulent matter upon which the second defendant induced the
plaintiff to enter into the transaction.
<P>

24   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that in
the instant case the measure of damages of the plaintiff is the prejudice
or
disadvantage suffered by him in consequence of that fraudulent inducement by
the second defendant; that that prejudice or disadvantage
is the difference
between the value of the business as represented and what was actually
transferred.  The value of what was actually
transferred was nothing; the value
of the business as represented was, so it was submitted, the three years of the
projected profit
of $141,000 a year, that is, $423,000.
<P>

25   	It was submitted that this is a case where there was a
precise representation as to the nature of the business and of the
benefit
which would be received by Mr Ramsey and his family as a result of the
transaction; but that in this case it should be recognised
that Mr Ramsey had
been looking for a business in which to invest, and that in consequence of the
fraudulent conduct of the second
defendant the plaintiff was deprived of the
opportunity of investing his redundancy money in some other business.  The
plaintiff
then expended his time and energy full time on this worthless
business and eventually, in order to support his wife and children,
had to go
into some other kind of work and leave it to his wife to attempt to carry on
the totally profitless business.
<P>

26   	I recognise that in certain circumstances it is open to a
plaintiff to include in a claim for damages in the tort of deceit
damages in
respect to a lost opportunity of the nature of that asserted on behalf of the
plaintiff.  However, as was recognised by
the High Court of Australia in
<i>Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance </i>at 13, it is for the plaintiff to
establish that there was such another opportunity available and the profit
which he would have obtained
from that opportunity.  There is no evidence in
the instant case of the nature of any other investment or business in which the
plaintiff
would have put the money which he put into the transaction with the
second defendant and there is no evidence of the profit which
he might have
made from such another investment.
<P>

27   	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that this is a case where
in the calculation of damages it is appropriate to adopt any formula
other than
that which was described by Dixon J in <i>Toteff v Antonas </i>and which I have
already quoted.
<P>

28   	The components of the claim for damages upon that formula
are set forth in items 2, 3 and 4 of the schedule of losses.  Item
2 is the
costs of setting up a company.  The plaintiff acquired a shelf company, Welcome
Waggon of Australia (New South Wales) Pty
Ltd.  The cost is shown as $890.
<P>

29   	Item 3 is loans to the company.  Originally not only did
the plaintiff spend his redundancy payment on this purchase, but
it was also
necessary for him to obtain a loan secured over his residence in the sum of
$70,000.  He lent this money to the company,
which was used as his vehicle for
conducting the business.  Subsequently the plaintiff was required to refinance
his loan and did
so with a loan from the Bank of Adelaide in the amount of
$78,000.  The outstanding amount of that loan was $78,021.45.
<P>

30   	It was submitted on behalf of the second defendant that
there should be only one half of that amount included as a component
in the
damages to be awarded to the plaintiff since, so it was submitted, the loan was
a loan made jointly to the plaintiff and to
his wife.  Bryson J dismissed the
claim of the plaintiff's wife, Kim Suellen Ramsey, the second plaintiff.
<P>

31   	The mortgage to Westpac Banking Corporation has been
admitted into evidence at the hearing before me as Exhibit C.  That mortgage
shows that the liability of the first plaintiff and his wife was a joint and
several liability.  That being so, there is no reason
why the component of
$78,021.45 should not be included in its totality in the damages to be awarded
to the first plaintiff, since
he could have been held solely liable by the bank
under the joint and several liability.
<P>

32   	Item 4 is headed "Losses Incurred as a Result of the
Failure of the Company".  It consists of two items, firstly (as item
4(a)) the
accumulated losses of the company which were paid personally by Mr Ramsey,
including interest payments on the foregoing
loan from Westpac Banking
Corporation.  Annexed to the affidavit of Mr Polaitis of 29 March 1999 as
annexure 4 is a profit and loss
statement.  That document discloses accumulated
losses of $26,513.
<P>

33   	An attempt was made on the part of the second defendant to
suggest that because the company in carrying on the business had
generated some
income, the Court should disregard the operating costs incurred in generating
that income.  The mere statement of
that submission is sufficient to dispose of
it.  The plaintiff will be entitled to the component of $26,513.
<P>

34   	Item 4(b) is the legal costs on refinancing the loan from
the Westpac Banking Corporation to the Bank of Adelaide.  I have
already
referred to the fact that the loan was increased when it was refinanced from
the one bank to the other.  There is some evidence
that parts of the loan were
used for purposes of a personal nature relating to the first plaintiff's house
and other areas of personal
indebtedness.  It was submitted on behalf of the
second defendant that the first plaintiff should be deprived of the component
of
$885.30, being the legal costs of refinancing.  It seems to me a quite
legitimate inference which I am entitled to draw that the
legal costs on
refinancing a loan of $78,000 would hardly have exceeded the legal costs of
refinancing a loan of $70,000.  In those
circumstances I am satisfied that the
full amount of $885.30 should be included in the damages to which the first
plaintiff is entitled
from the second defendant.
<P>

35   	On my calculations, therefore, the amount of the damages
will consist of the three components, being $78,021.45, $26,513 and
$885.30,
which I calculate as totalling $106,309.75.
<P>

36   	Counsel for the plaintiff has prepared a schedule of
interest upon the component, being item 3.  That schedule of interest
totals
$31,429.  Counsel for the second defendant has not had an opportunity of fully
considering that schedule of interest calculations,
which I am informed is
based on the Supreme Court rates of interest applicable at the appropriate
time.  Accordingly, I propose to
reserve to the parties liberty to approach my
Associate concerning any arithmetical calculations in the amount of my
certification
and in particular concerning the calculation of interest, within
a specified period: I would suggest no more than seven days from
today.
<P>

37   	I note that the judgment of his Honour Bryson J reserved
further consideration of all questions of costs.  For the assistance
of his
Honour when he comes to consider the costs of the hearing before me, I propose
to record that I am of the view that it is
appropriate that the costs of the
first plaintiff of the enquiry before me be paid by the second defendant.
<P>

38   	I propose to formulate my certificate.  I make the
following orders:
<P>

1.	I certify the amount of damages as $106,309.75 and the amount of interest as
$31,429.
<P>

2.	I reserve to the parties liberty within seven days of the date hereof to
make written submissions to correct any errors of arithmetical
calculations in
the foregoing amounts of damages and interest.
<P>

3.	I express the view that it is appropriate that the costs of the first
plaintiff of the enquiry before me should be paid by the
second defendant.
<P>

39   	EXHIBIT #E SCHEDULE OF INTEREST TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT
OBJECTION
