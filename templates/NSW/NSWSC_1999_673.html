<P>

TUESDAY 6 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>20280/96</u>	<u>BRYAN DAVID JORDAN v THE COMMONWEALTH OF </u>
<P>

<u>AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This proceeding is one of the many arising out of the collision
between the HMAS Melbourne and the HMAS Voyager on 10 February
1964.  The
process was filed on 20 March 1996.  A Notice of Motion was filed on the same
day.  It sought an extension of the relevant
limitation period.
<P>

2  	The Notice of Motion was heard on 16 June 1999.  The plaintiff
relied on his own affidavit.  Certain exhibits were tendered
(including a
report from Professor Raphael and a report from Dr  Wu).  The plaintiff was
cross-examined.  The defendant did not adduce
any evidence.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff was born on 26 June 1943.  He became a member of
the Royal Australian Navy on 8 July 1961.  At the time of the
collision, he was
a member of the crew of HMAS Melbourne.  Paragraph 6 of his affidavit provides
a version of what he observed at
the time of and following the collision.
<P>

4  	He was discharged from the Navy on 5 April 1966.  Details of his
post Naval history may be gleaned from both his affidavit and
the transcript of
his cross-examination.  The history reveals that he has had a problem with
alcoholism and many jobs.  Save for
particular mention of certain matters, it
is not necessary to repeat history details in this judgment.
<P>

5  	In or about 1995, his wife asked him to get treatment for both
his alcohol problem and his emotional state.  He first made contact
with a
solicitor in 1995.  He saw Mr Forster (who practices under the name of Hollows)
on television.  He then telephoned Mr Forster
and it was arranged for him to
see Professor Raphael.  He was seen and assessed by her on 21 July 1995.  The
Court has been told
that Professor Raphael did not provide him with any
diagnosis.  It appears that Mr Forster may have commenced proceedings on the
plaintiff's behalf in the Supreme Court of Victoria.  The plaintiff maintains
that the commencement of those proceedings was the
solicitor's idea and that at
the time he was not suffering from any health problems.  It may be that these
proceedings were subsequently
brought to an end.
<P>

6  	After a meeting with Rodney Ayliff, contact was made with the
plaintiff's present solicitor (Mr Taylor).  Mr Taylor arranged
for the
plaintiff to see Dr Wu.  The report from Dr Wu is dated 1 February 1996.  Dr Wu
reached the conclusion that the plaintiff
suffered from multiple problems.  Two
of his problems are nightmares and insomnia.  Dr Wu made a diagnosis of post
traumatic stress
disorder.  He also expressed the view that the alcoholism was
secondary to this disorder.  The report also referred to the plaintiff's
tendency to be dismissive and maintain a facade of not suffering from any
health problem.  In paragraph 14 of his affidavit, the
plaintiff deposed inter
alia to the following:-
<P>

"At the conclusion of the interview with Dr Wu he informed me that I was
suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and he discussed
my problems,
including my alcoholism which he said was a consequence of my stress disorder.
I did not know until Dr Wu explained
to me that I was suffering from a
psychiatric illness or disability.  I did not know the nature and extent of the
condition from
which I had been suffering and to some extent still don't."
<P>

7  	Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u>
1969</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a> prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> unless the
Court is satisfied of the matters set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subsection (1) thereof.  These are threshold
requirements to the making of an
order.  When the threshold requirements have been satisfied, there is a
discretionary power to grant
relief.
<P>

8  	The defendant's submissions were limited to the requirements set
forth in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1) (a) (i) - (iii).  It was conceded that it is open to the
Court to find that the requirement listed in paragraph (a) (i) has been
satisfied.  It was contended that neither (ii) nor (iii) of the paragraph had
been satisfied.
<P>

9  	In my view, the threshold requirement listed in paragraph (a) (i)
has been satisfied.  In these circumstances it is unnecessary
to pursue the
contentions relating to (ii) and (iii) thereof.  However, it may be of
assistance if some observations are made.
<P>

10  	There is evidence that the plaintiff has been diagnosed as
suffering from a psychiatric disorder.  There is evidence which
may be seen as
satisfying the requirements of (ii) and (iii).  I take the view that the
evidence of the plaintiff has to be assessed
in the light of the facade that he
seeks to maintain as to his health and his tendency to be dismissive of
suggestion to the contrary.
<P>

11  	The defendant did not raise any discretionary consideration in
opposition to the plaintiff's application.  Accordingly, no
submissions were
made on the matter of discretion.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the Court that he has
an entitlement to relief.  In the relevant circumstances of
this case, I am
satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

13  	Accordingly, I have reached the decision that it is just and
reasonable to make the order sought and that such an order should
be made in
this case.
<P>

14  	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded
in the Statement of Claim up to and including 20 March 1996.
 I reserve the
question of costs.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
