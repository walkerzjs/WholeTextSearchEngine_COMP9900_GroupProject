<b><u>10846/97 Leonard Cornelius Orr v Dennis Patrick Grogan &amp;
Ors</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	This is a money claim made by the plaintiff, Mr L C Orr,
solicitor, against the defendants, Mr D P Grogan, Mr L J Webb and
Ms M L
Linden, solicitors.  The first and second defendants were at relevant times the
principals of the firm Grogan &amp; Webb,
and the third defendant was employed
by them.
<P>

2   	In the following narrative of events, I will indicate where
a contentious issue arises.  Otherwise, my account of the facts
was common
ground or not seriously in issue.
<P>

3   	Although there are some serious differences between the
versions of events given by Mr Orr and Ms Linden in these proceedings,
I think
both were doing their honest best to be accurate and reliable.
<P>

4   	In 1989, Mr J E Nove retained Mr Orr to act for him in
matrimonial proceedings.  An application was made to the Family Court
by Mr
Nove for a property settlement.  A cross application was made by Mr Nove's
wife.  The proceedings were heard by his Honour
Justice P J Moss in July 1990.
Mr P I Rose of Queen's Counsel and Mr P M Connor of counsel appeared for Mr
Nove.  Mr R G Lethbridge
of counsel appeared for Mrs Nove.  At the conclusion
of the hearing, his Honour reserved his decision.
<P>

5   	The matter was listed for judgment on 14 September 1990.  A
matter seriously in contention had been the value of a farm property
at
Tyagarah.  Prior to 14 September 1990, a price for the sale of that property
had been negotiated significantly higher than had
previously been envisaged
(although contracts were not exchanged for the sale of the two lots comprising
the Tyagarah property until
17 and 30 October 1990).  Accordingly, judgment was
deferred.  The hearing was resumed on 12 November 1990 to take into account the
price secured for the Tyagarah property.  Judgment was given on 16 November
1990.
<P>

6   	In relation to the sale of the Tyagarah property, Mr Nove
retained Ms Linden to act for him.  Mr Orr and Ms Linden maintained
contact in
relation to the sale.  Their relationship was cordial and co-operative.
<P>

7   	On 9 October 1990 Mr Orr wrote to Mr Nove as follows:
<P>

"As you are aware the writer and Counsel have carried the conduct of this case
on a speculative basis and we would be pleased if
you would give consideration
to payment of our outstanding account from the proceeds of the sale of the
Tyagarah farm.
<P>

If you regard this as reasonable would you please sign the enclosed
authority."
<P>

8   	The authority signed by Mr Nove and dated 10 October 1990
was in the following terms:
<P>

<center>	"AUTHORITY</center>
<P>


<P>

	Messrs Grogan &amp; Co.
<P>

Solicitors
<P>

"I JOLYON EMANUEL NOVE hereby irrevocably authorise and direct you to pay to my
solicitors Messrs. Orr &amp; Co., from the proceeds
of sale of the farm
property at Tyagarah their costs and disbursements."
<P>

9   	The authority was forwarded to Messrs Grogan and Webb by Mr
Orr under cover of a letter dated 12 October 1990 which read as
follows:
<P>

"We enclose an authority to you for payment of our professional costs and
disbursements from the proceeds of sale of the Tyagarah
farm.  We will advise
you of the outstanding amount in due course."
<P>

10   	Ms Linden read the authority and filed it.  She had no
conversation with Mr Orr about the authority at that stage.  She intended,
at
that stage, to act on the authority.  Ms Linden knew of the Family Court
proceedings and she knew that all of the properties of
the parties to those
proceedings were "in the melting pot".  That, to her knowledge, would have
included the Tyagarah property.
<P>

11   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the
authority should be construed as relating only to costs and disbursements
to
date.  I disagree.  The terminology of the authority was not so limited.  The
context was also against such a restrictive construction.
 The possibility was
that further work would have to be done while ever judgment was reserved.  More
particularly, the need for further
consideration having to be given to the
matter, in view of the price negotiated for the Tyagarah property, was already
apparent by
9 October 1990.  There was no logical reason for restricting the
authority to costs incurred to date when the prospect of further
costs being
incurred was not only a possibility but an actuality.
<P>

12   	As appears from the judgment of his Honour Justice Moss,
real estate owned at the date of separation consisted of the former
matrimonial
home (which was in the name of Mrs Nove), an investment property at Trouve
Street, Lane Cove (which was in the name of
Mr Nove), and a farm property at
Tyagarah in which Mr Nove had a 60% benefit interest.  (The other 40% was
beneficially owned by
members of Mr Nove's family and children of the
marriage.)  Mr and Mrs Nove were also each in possession of personalty.  In
addition,
Mr Nove had, since the separation, acquired a further property, at
Linley Point, which was heavily mortgaged and which had proved
to be a poor
investment.
<P>

13   	His Honour treated the Linley Point investment as being
exclusively Mr Nove's responsibility.  He put it out of account. 
The
settlement under the judgment was that Mrs Nove was to keep the matrimonial
home; Mr Nove was to keep the Trouve Street property
and was to take the nett
proceeds of sale of the farm property at Tyagarah; each party was to retain the
personalty which they respectively
had in their possession; and Mrs Nove was to
make a payment of $64,000 to Mr Nove.  That payment was a balancing item which
produced
a distribution of property (not taking the Linley Point property into
account) of approximately 53% in favour of Mrs Nove and approximately
47% in
favour of Mr Nove.
<P>

14   	On 15 November 1990, Mr Orr sent Mr Nove a statement of
account, referring to earlier accounts and payments on account for
$68,691. (In
this judgment, I have ignored cents for all figures.)
<P>

15   	The $64,000 payable by Mrs Nove under the property
settlement was received by Mr Orr on 17 December 1990.  By arrangement
with Mr
Nove, one-half of this sum, $32,000, was paid to Mr Nove.  The balance was
applied to Mr Orr's costs and disbursements, in
particular, approximately
$11,000 in payment for counsel's fees and approximately $21,000 towards Mr
Orr's profit costs. 
<P>

16   	On 21 December 1990, Mr Orr wrote to Ms Linden as
follows:
<P>

"We refer to the irrevocable authority previously forwarded to you with regard
to payment of our outstanding costs and disbursements
from the proceeds of sale
of the Tyagarah land and advise that the present outstanding debt by Mr Nove to
this firm is $43,966.25.
 We would be pleased to receive your cheque
accordingly.
<P>

We have today forwarded a copy of this letter to Mr Nove."
<P>

Ms Linden read the letter and filed it.  She had no conversation with Mr Orr
about the letter at that stage.
<P>

17   	Mr Nove was dissatisfied with the result of the Family
Court proceedings.  He instructed Mr Orr to institute an appeal.  On
29 January
1991, he withdrew his instructions from Mr Orr.
<P>

18   	On 6 February 1991, Mr Orr sent a further statement of
account to Mr Nove.  The costs and disbursements included the costs
of the
resumed hearing before his Honour Justice Moss.  The amount outstanding, after
credit for the $32,000, was $54,472.
<P>

19   	On the same date, Mr Orr wrote to Ms Linden as follows:
<P>

"Please note that we no longer act for Mr Nove.  We forwarded to Mr Nove today
an updated memorandum of professional costs and disbursements
and statement of
account and advised him that the final balance owing to this firm is
$54,472.64.
<P>

We have requested Mr Nove to confirm this with you so that payment in that sum
may be made to us from the proceeds of sale of the
Tyagarah farm properties in
accordance with the irrevocable authority previously forwarded to you."
<P>

20   	On 11 February 1991, Mr Nove informed Ms Linden that he
was not happy with Mr Orr's services, that he did not way to pay him,
and that
he did not want Mr Orr to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the
Tyagarah property.
<P>

21   	On 12 February 1991, Mr Nove wrote to Mr Orr.  He said he
disputed the account.  He alleged negligence.  He went on to say:
<P>

"Your attention is drawn to my understanding that we jointly agreed to revoke
the requirement that the payment of your fees be made
from the farm sale.  This
was done at the time of my prior payment to you of $32,000.
<P>

If indeed this payment of $32,000 is held by you not to be part of us jointly
revoking the requirement then you are required within
14 days to return to me
the $32,000 that you held in your trust account for me."
<P>

A copy of the letter was sent by Mr Nove to Ms Linden.
<P>

22   	On 21 February 1991, Ms Linden consulted Ms Shirvington of
the Law Society of New South Wales.  She explained the situation
to Ms
Shirvington, who advised that Ms Linden was obliged to implement the client's
fresh instructions, and that Ms Linden had no
obligation to Mr Orr.
<P>

23   	On 21 February 1991, Ms Linden spoke to Mr Orr.  This was
their first conversation about Mr Orr's claim on the proceeds of
sale of the
Tyagarah property.  Ms Linden informed Mr Orr of the advice she had received
and of her intention to follow that advice.
 Mr Orr said that, in that
conversation, Ms Linden also made it clear to him that her sympathies were with
him, and that she would
see he was paid if she could.  I accept that.  But I
also find that Ms Linden believed she had no alternative but to implement Mr
Nove's instructions to her, and that is what she told Mr Orr.
<P>

24   	On the same date, 21 February 1991, Mr Orr spoke to Ms
Shirvington.  According to Mr Orr's file note, Ms Shirvington said
that the
irrevocable authority was "just an authority unless it's binding in a
contractual sense".   The file note went on to record
"If it's in trust, he can
change his mind".  Mr Orr took Ms Shirvington's advice that the client could
change his mind to be qualified
by any contractual element in the authority.
<P>

25   	Mr Orr sought advice from Mr Rose QC about the situation.
He advised that the Law Society's position was wrong and that it
was better to
resolve the matter amicably rather than by court proceedings.  Mr Orr said he
therefore refrained from seeking an injunction.
<P>

26   	On 27 February 1991 Mr Nove wrote to Mr Orr setting out
his complaints in some detail.  He concluded the letter as follows:
<P>

"Following my letter to you of 12th February 1991 14 days has now expired since
that letter and I determine from that that the $32,000
held by you is part of
us jointly revoking the requirement that your fees be paid from the sale of the
farm.  You are now required
to pay $8,775.00 to Mr Peter Rose QC out of my
$32,000 trust money."
<P>

27   	On 4 March 1991 Mr Nove wrote to Ms Linden as follows:
<P>

"I refer to my irrevocable authority of 10/10/90 directing payment of costs to
Orr &amp; Co. from the proceeds of sale of my properties
at Tyagarah.
<P>

I hereby revoke that authority and direct you to make no payment of cost to Orr
and Co. until further direction."
<P>

28   	On 7 March 1991, Mr Orr wrote to Mr Nove.  Negligence was
denied.  Release of the irrevocable authority was denied.  It was
stated that
the $32,000 had been paid simply on account and not otherwise.  Release of a
lien over the file was refused pending payment
of the balance of Mr Orr's
account.
<P>

29   	On 8 March 1991, Mr Orr wrote to Ms Shirvington at the Law
Society.  He asked for an urgent ruling by the Council of the Law
Society.  
<P>

30   	On 8 March 1991, Mr Orr wrote to Ms Linden, enclosing a
copy of his letter to the Ms Shirvington and asking for confirmation
that the
outstanding funds would be retained in her trust account pending a ruling by
the Council of the Law Society.
<P>

31   	On 11 March 1991 Ms Linden wrote to Mr Orr as follows:
<P>

"We refer to your letter of the 8th March, 1991 and advise that our client's
instructions are unchanged in that we are directed
not to hold any funds on
your behalf from the settlement monies.  As this accords with the current
advice we have received from the
Law Society we must adhere to our client's
instructions."
<P>

32   	On 12 March 1991, Mr Orr wrote to Ms Linden asking her to
reconsider her position and advancing arguments in his cause, including
that Ms
Shirvington had expressed reservations about her view when speaking earlier to
Mr Orr.  
<P>

33   	On 13 March 1991, Mr Orr wrote to the President of the Law
Society advancing arguments in support of the ruling that had been
sought.
<P>

34   	Mr Orr asserts that, on 13 March 1991, he spoke to Ms
Linden, advising her of his further representations to the Law Society,
and
that she said to him words to the effect, "I will get a second opinion before
releasing the funds".  Mr Orr has a file note dated
13 March 1991 relating to a
telephone conversation with Ms Linden.  It reads as follows:
<P>

"She will get second opinion before releasing funds."
<P>

35   	Ms Linden's account of that conversation is as follows.
<P>

"He said:	I've obtained advice from a QC and he is clearly of the opinion that
you can't ignore the irrevocable authority.
<P>

I said:		Will you send me a copy of that advice?
<P>

He said:	No, I don't want to do that.  You should get an opinion from a
silk.
<P>

I said:		We're not going to pay for that.  Why don't you give me a copy of your
QC's opinion.
<P>

He said:	No.  I've written again to the Law Society.  I would like you to
reconsider releasing the funds to Nove or at least hold
the money in trust
until the Law Society hands down a ruling.
<P>

I said:		I can't.  That's what Jolyon has instructed me to do.  I wish I didn't
have to do this but in view of Jolyon's (Mr Nove's)
instructions and the advice
from Virginia Shirvington, I have to.
<P>

He said:	Would you at least write to the Law Society and ask for written
confirmation of its earlier advice?
<P>

I said:		Yes, OK.  But until I get different advice, I have to follow Jolyon's
instructions."
<P>

36   	Mr Orr denied that there was any conversation about
providing a copy of counsel's opinion.  He said there was no written opinion.
The advice had been received in conference.  Nothing turns on that.
<P>

37   	Mr Orr did not admit the balance of the conversation as
recounted by Ms Linden.  Mr Orr also denied that Ms Linden said that
she would
have to follow the client's instructions until she got different advice.
<P>

38   	It is at least clear that Mr Orr anticipated that Ms
Linden would direct her request for further advice to the Law Society
rather
than elsewhere.  The following is an extract from Mr Orr's evidence:
<P>

"Q.	You, at the time you made this call, had from her a statement in writing
that she was going to act in accordance with your instructions.
 That statement
was made on 11 March; is that right?
<P>

A.	I said a bit more than that Mr Morris.  In accordance with the current
instructions and with the current advice from the Law
Society she and I
discussed the hope that the problem could be resolved by the Law Society coming
up with an opinion that was different
from the preliminary verbal opinion on
the telephone that was contrary to counsel's advice.
<P>

Q.	It was clear until she got the clearance she felt obliged to release the
money, until she got some other opinion?
<P>

A.	Until she got some other opinion, yes."
<P>

39   	But Mr Orr's evidence went further than that.  He asserted
that Ms Linden expressly undertook to withhold funds from Mr Nove
pursuant to
the authority until such further advice was to hand, and then not to disburse
such funds without notice to him if the
further advice was adverse.
<P>

40   	Mr Orr's evidence on this topic was as follows.
<P>

"Q.	What I have suggested to you as recorded opinion is, in fact, written
confirmation that what she said was, I'll get written
confirmation?
<P>

A.	No.  Mr Morris, what I think happened and it is partly reconstructed, I
think I faxed this letter to her, spoke to her and said,
`Will you please get a
second opinion before releasing the funds?'  She said, `Yes."  I think that is
the way it happened."
<P>

And in the same vein:
<P>

"Q.	Well, if I can take you back to your second statement first and to the
passage that you do not deny, although you cannot recall.
 Is it your view that
what you might have said was, looking at the bottom of page 2, `Would you at
[least] write to the Law Society
and ask for a second opinion'?
<P>

A.	I am almost certain that I said because I got the file note, `Would you get
a second opinion before releasing the funds?'  That
is what I said.  That was
in accordance with all of this conduct between us and she was quite agreeable
to that."
<P>

And again:
<P>

"Q.	What you said, is it, that on the 13th despite her stating this position in
February and in March (that she would implement
Mr Nove's instructions), you
talked her out of it?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	Is that what you say?
<P>

A.	Yes."
<P>

41   	I am not persuaded that Ms Linden gave the undertaking
asserted by Mr Orr.  The whole point of Ms Linden's dilemma was that
she
understood, on the advice she had received, to be that she was bound to act on
the client's latest instructions irrespective
of the terms of the authority.
How could she undertake not to do so until further advice or confirmatory
advice had been received?
<P>

42   	By the same token, there is no basis for any such
undertaking arising by implication from Ms Linden's agreement to ask the
Law
Society for further advice.
<P>

43   	There is then no basis either for the asserted implication
that Ms Linden would not disburse funds covered by the authority
without notice
to Mr Orr if the Law Society's further advice were adverse.
<P>

44   	I accept that Mr Orr believed that Ms Linden would
withhold sufficient funds to cover his costs and disbursements until she
had
received further advice from the Law Society, and would then not disburse the
funds covering his claim without notice to him
if the advice was adverse.  But,
in my view that belief was not soundly based, for the reasons I have given.
<P>

45   	 I pick up the narrative from the conversation between Mr
Orr and Ms Linden on 13 March 1991.  On the same date, Ms Linden
wrote to Ms
Shirvington recording that her advice had been that Ms Linden was obliged to
follow the client's latest instructions
which were not to pay the monies to Mr
Orr.  She concluded the letter as follows:
<P>

"We have since had correspondence from Orr and Co., a copy of which is
enclosed.  We have also been requested by Len Orr of Orr
and Co. to seek
written confirmation from you of your advice of the 21st February."
<P>

46   	On 14 March 1991, the Law Society wrote to Mr Orr,
acknowledging receipt of his letter of 8 March 1991 and advising that the
matter had been referred to the Society's General Practice Rulings
Committee.
<P>

47   	Ms Linden says that, in mid-March 1991, Mr Nove instructed
her not to tell Mr Orr when the Tyagarah sale settled, and that
she told Mr
Nove she accepted those instructions.
<P>

48   	The sale of one lot comprising part of the Tyagarah
property was completed on 22 March 1991.  The nett proceeds in relation
to Mr
Nove's 60% interest were paid to Mr Nove by bank cheque supplied by the
purchaser on settlement.  Mr Nove signed a receipt
for the bank cheque on 25
March 1991, presumably when it was delivered to him by Ms Linden. 
<P>

49   	On 25 March 1991, Mr Orr says he spoke to Ms Linden and
that she said, "We settled Lot 5 on Friday.  We are pushing to settle
the other
Lot this week."  Mr Orr has a file note of the same date:  "Settled lot 5 Fri.
Pushing to settle other one this week."
 Ms Linden denies that there was any
such conversation with her.  It was put to Mr Orr that the conversation might
have been with
the estate agent or with the purchaser's solicitors.  Mr Orr
said that was highly unlikely.
<P>

50   	It is unnecessary to resolve this conflict of
recollection.  Possibly, Mr Orr was informed of the sale by someone else.
Possibly,
Ms Linden was not instructed to keep settlement of the sale to
herself until after the sale of the first lot had been settled.  One
way or the
other, Mr Orr knew the sale of part of the property had been completed and that
completion of the remaining lot was imminent.
<P>

51   	Mr Orr says he made no complaint about the funds being
disbursed from the sale of the first lot because he knew there were
sufficient
funds coming from the sale of the second lot.
<P>

52   	On 26 March 1991, Mr Nove's new solicitors, Messrs.
Carroll and Knudsen wrote to Mr Orr, referring to the dispute over costs
and
foreshadowing a compromise proposal to facilitate release of Mr Nove's papers
in exchange for satisfactory security for costs
as agreed or taxed.  This does
not appear to have had any bearing on the dealings between Mr Orr and Ms
Linden.  Further correspondence
with Messrs Carroll and Knudsen ensued which,
likewise, does not appear to have a bearing on the issues in these
proceedings.
<P>

53   	The sale of the second lot comprising the balance of the
Tyagarah property was completed on 28 March 1991.  The nett proceeds
in
relation to Mr Nove's interest were paid over in the same manner as in the case
of the first lot.  Mr Nove again signed a receipt
for the bank cheque, although
on this occasion the receipt is not dated.
<P>

54   	I find that the bank cheques were handed over to Ms Linden
(or her representative) on settlement and subsequently delivered
to Mr Nove on
each occasion.
<P>

55   	As at 28 March 1991, Ms Linden had received no reply to
her letter to the Law Society of 13 March 1991.  On 3 April 1991,
she received
a letter from the Law Society dated 26 March 1991 advising that the matter had
been referred to the General Practice
Rulings Committee.  By then the sale was
completed.
<P>

56   	On 12 April 1991, Mr Orr sent to Ms Linden a copy of the
letter of 14 March 1991 received from the Law Society.
<P>

57   	On 12 April 1991, Mr Orr spoke to Ms Linden.  There is no
material dispute about the terms of the conversation.  According
to Mr Orr, Ms
Linden said that the Law Society had not replied to her letter (true, as at
completion of the sale, so far as Ms Linden
was then aware), that she had
spoken to people around the office and paid out.  A conversation in those terms
is confirmed by a file
note made by Mr Orr on 12 April 1991.  Ms Linden's
account of the conversation is as follows.
<P>

"He said:	I understand Tyagarah's settled and Nove's got the proceeds.
<P>

I said:		Yes.  I was bound by my client's instructions.  Virginia Shirvington
clearly told me that I had to release the funds and
I did not get a reply to my
letter from the Law Society to advise me otherwise.  I discussed it with my
partners and we all agreed
that the funds should be released.  I had no choice
but to release the funds.  I told you that this is what we would have to
do."
<P>

58   	Mr Orr said in his evidence that, if Ms Linden had
informed him that she intended to release the funds "prior to obtaining
a
second opinion from the Law Society", he would have sought a Supreme Court
injunction restraining her from releasing the funds.
<P>

59   	On 7 June 1991, Mr Nove commenced proceedings to obtain Mr
Orr's file in relation to the Family Court proceedings.  On 15
August 1991, the
application was dismissed.
<P>

60   	On 28 November 1991, a certificate of taxation issued in
relation to the Family Court appeal proceedings in the sum of $7,711.
 On 16
April 1992, a certificate of taxation issued in the Family Court trial
proceedings for $90,144, the balance then owing being
$20,300.
<P>

61   	On 2 June 1992, Mr Nove was made bankrupt on his own
petition.  Mr Orr received a dividend of $845.
<P>

62   	Mr Orr spoke to Ms Linden on 18 March 1997.  He has a
handwritten file note of speaking to Ms Linden on that date.  There
is also a
memorandum relating to that conversation, which Mr Orr says he dictated
immediately following the conversation.  According
to the memorandum, Mr Orr
referred to the case of <i>Twigg v Keady </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FamCA/1996/115.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FamCA 115</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20FLC%2092%2d712" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) FLC 92-712</a> as providing a
basis for his claim on the proceeds of the sale of the Tyagarah property.  The
memorandum continues as follows:
<P>

"I said:	You released the funds without having let me know.
<P>

She said:	I agonised over it, I was in a terrible position, I felt you should
be paid and yet I was told by the client to not pay
it.  I wrote to the Law
Society, I did not want to pay it out, my problem was I was told by the Law
Society that I had to pay it
out.  I think that I did all that I could.
<P>

I said:		The problem was that you said you were going to get a second opinion
from the Law Society and then you said that you asked
around the office and
just paid it out without telling me.
<P>

She said:	My instructions were not to tell you.  I hoped you would get a fast
injunction, as a fellow practitioner I wanted you
to be paid."
<P>

Ms Linden gives a similar account of this conversation. 
<P>

63   	At all relevant times, Ms Linden was aware that the
Tyagarah property was part of the property the subject of the Family Court
proceedings.  In her witness statement, Ms Linden said:
<P>

"During 1990 and 1991, I acted on the client's instructions in relation to the
sale and transfer of various properties owned by
the client as a result of
family law proceedings between the client and his ex-wife.  During that time, I
was aware that the Plaintiff
was acting for the client in relation to Family
Court proceedings.  I had a number of telephone conversations with the
Plaintiff
in relation to the sale of the properties pursuant to the Family
Court orders and in relation to subpoenas requiring the production
of those
files."
<P>

I have referred to her evidence that she knew when she received the irrevocable
authority that all the real estate owned by Mr Nove
and his wife were "in the
melting pot", which would have included the Tyagarah property.  Furthermore,
one stage, she supplied a
chronology relating to the sale of the Tyagarah
property for the purpose of the Family Court proceedings.  The following is
part
of her oral evidence bearing on the same topic.
<P>

"Q.	I think you said earlier that you were certainly aware that the farm or the
proceeds of sale of the farm were part of the property
of the parties which
were the subject of the Family Court proceedings?
<P>

A.	That's right.
<P>

Q.	And at some point you became aware that the effect of the judgment was that
amongst the assets which Mr Nove would keep were
the proceeds of sale of the
farm?
<P>

A.	That was - yes, that is what I believed he was going to keep that.
<P>

Q.	Can I suggest that you must have known that because you were certainly when
the judgment was given made aware that judgment had
been given by someone?
<P>

A.	I assume so.  I do not have a particular recollection.
<P>

Q.	There is hardly any doubt that someone, such as Mr Nove or Mr Orr or Mr
Paltos told you that judgment had been given?
<P>

A.	Judgment had been given.
<P>

Q.	You understood that it was within the power of the Family Court judge,
Justice Moss, to deal with the property or the proceeds
of sale as he thought
appropriate?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	And that fact might impinge on what you had to do with the proceeds of
sale?
<P>

A.	I think I assumed at all times that Mr Nove should deal with that property
and nobody had told me otherwise.  Jolyon hadn't told
me otherwise, my client,
and I assume somebody would stop me if there was a problem with it.
<P>

Q.	In other words, you acted upon the assumption which you now know to be
correct, that the terms of the judgment were such as not
to impede Mr Orr in
dealing with the farm?
<P>

A.	Mr Nove.
<P>

Q.	I'm sorry, Mr Nove, in dealing with the farm?
<P>

A.	That's right, yes."
<P>

64   	I find that, when proceeds of sale of the Tyagarah
property were disbursed, Ms Linden was aware the property had fallen to
Mr Nove
under the Family Court judgment of 16 November 1990.
<P>

65   	Mr Orr asserts that, in the events that have occurred, he
has lost the sum of $27,166, being $28,011 pursuant to the taxation
certificates less the bankruptcy dividend.  He also asserts consequential loss,
being interest on his bank overdraft, in the sum
of $12,304.
<P>

66   	The salient findings are as follows:
<P>

(a)	Notice of the irrevocable authority was given by Mr Orr to Ms Linden on 12
October 1990.
<P>

(b)	Ms Linden was aware that the authority related to costs and disbursements
in Family Court proceedings in which the Tyagarah
property was, as she became
aware, awarded to Mr Nove (as to his 60% interest).
<P>

(c)	The authority related to costs and disbursements in the Family Court
proceedings incurred to date and prospective.
<P>

(d)	Mr Orr notified Ms Linden of the amount of such unpaid costs and
disbursements on 15 November 1990, (as varied) on 21 December
1990, and (as
further varied) on 6 February 1991.
<P>

(e)	Mr Nove withdrew his instructions to Mr Orr on 29 January 1991.
<P>

(f)	On 11 February 1991, Mr Nove told Ms Linden he did not want Mr Orr to be
paid anything out of the proceeds of the sale of the
Tyagarah property.  On 4
March 1991, Mr Nove gave formal instructions to Ms Linden accordingly.
<P>

(g)	On 21 February 1991, Ms Linden was advised by Ms Shirvington that she was
obliged to implement Mr Nove's new instructions. 
That day, Ms Linden informed
Mr Orr accordingly.
<P>

(h)	On 8 March 1991, Mr Orr asked for Ms Linden's confirmation that she would
retain funds for his outstanding costs and disbursements
pending a ruling by
the Law Society, to whom Mr Orr had written requesting such a ruling.
<P>

(i)	On 11 March 1991, Ms Linden told Mr Orr she could not.
<P>

(j)	On 13 March 1991, Ms Linden agreed to request written confirmation by the
Law Society of Ms Shirvington's earlier advice, but
stated that without
different advice she would have to implement Mr Nove's instructions.
<P>

(k)	There was no undertaking or the like by Ms Linden that she would hold funds
for Mr Orr pending further advice by the Law Society
or that she would not
disburse such funds without notice to Mr Orr.
<P>

(l)	On 13 March 1991, Ms Linden sought written confirmation of the earlier
advice.  No response had been received by her before
the sale of the Tyagarah
was completed on 22 and 28 March 1991, and then (on 3 April 1991) advising only
that the matter had been
referred to a Committee.
<P>

(m)	On 22 and 28 March 1991, the nett proceeds of sale of the Tyagarah property
(as to Mr Nove's 60% interest) were paid by bank
cheques, supplied by the
purchaser on settlement, drawn in favour of Mr Nove.
<P>

67   	Mr Orr's claim was put on several grounds.  One was in
reliance upon Article 114(3) in Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency (16th
Ed,
1996).
<P>

"Where an agent is directed or authorised by his principal to pay to a third
party money out of a fund existing or accruing in his
hands to the use of the
principal, and he expressly or impliedly promises such third party to pay him,
or to receive or hold such
money on his behalf or for his use, he is personally
liable to pay such third party, or to receive or hold such money on his behalf
or for his use, as the case may be, even if he has had fresh instructions from
the principal not to pay such third party."
<P>

68   	The basis in precedent for this statement of principle is
recorded as follows in Bowstead (paragraph 9-107):
<P>

"A large group of mainly nineteenth-century cases establishes that where an
agent holds a fund for his principal and is directed
by that principal to pay
it to a third party, and notifies the third party that he is willing to do so,
he becomes liable to the
third party, and the principal's authority becomes
irrevocable."
<P>

69   	The formulation of principle dates from the second edition
of Bowstead.  It is too solidly entrenched to entertain disturbing
it at my
level in the judicial hierarchy. 
<P>

70   	The statement of principles applies by its terms to a fund
"accruing" in the hands of the agent.  It is, therefore, of no
moment that, in
the present case, the proceeds of sale of the Tyagarah property was not in the
defendants' hands at the time the
authority was executed or when the authority
came to Ms Linden's notice.
<P>

71   	Nor does it matter that the proceeds of sale (in so far as
Mr Nove had an interest in them) were not paid into an account
under the
defendants' control.  Ms Linden had de facto control of the funds to be
retained.  She had the capacity to refuse to accept
instructions for the
payment of the whole of the nett proceeds of sale by bank cheques drawn in
favour of Mr Nove; and she had the
capacity to request that part of the nett
proceeds of sale be paid into her firm's trust account.  In the events that
occurred, she
had obtained possession of the bank cheques payable in favour of
Mr Nove on settlement; and she had the capacity to refuse to deliver
the bank
cheques to him, otherwise than in exchange for the funds to be deducted and
retained under the authority. 
<P>

72   	What of the element in the Bowstead principle that the
agent has expressly or impliedly promised the third party to account
to him?
In the present case there was no express promise, nor even an express
acknowledgment of the receipt of the authority.  Did
silence amount to an
implied promise within the meaning of the statement of principle in
Bowstead?
<P>

73   	The statement of principle in Bowstead was applied by
Brownie J in <i>Redglove Holdings Pty Ltd v Kindy 4 Kids (Australia) Pty
Ltd</i> (5 December 1994, unreported).  In that case, the party in the role of
agent, a Mr Licardy, wrote to the beneficiary before irrevocable
authorities
came into existence.
<P>

"We confirm that on 29th June, 1994 Agreements for Sale with respect to the
abovementioned business were exchanged, settlement of
which is expected to take
place within the next fourteen (14) days.
<P>

On settlement we are instructed by our client that your commission in the sum
of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000) will be paid
from the proceeds of
sale."
<P>

After the irrevocable authorities were delivered to him, Mr Licardy said to the
beneficiary, "no worries, you'll be fixed up".
<P>

74   	Pertinently, Brownie J held that the letter was a
sufficient "promise" without the subsequent oral statement.  So far as its
express terms were concerned, the letter acknowledged instructions to implement
the foreshadowed authorities.  That was construed
by Brownie J as giving rise
to an implied promise to do so.
<P>

75   	The statement of principle in Bowstead is one developed as
a matter of commercial practicality, designed to give effect to
a commercial
commitment.  The function of the "promise" is that of an assurance to the
beneficiary of the authority that the principal's
commitment will be
implemented.  The beneficiary of the commitment is then relieved of the
commercial necessity to take further steps
to protect his interests, for
example, by enforcing the commitment by injunction (if available), or by
obtaining other security or
by pressing for earlier payment.  Conduct which
conveys such an assurance of implementation should be sufficient to satisfy the
element
of promise, express or implied.
<P>

76   	That, it seems to me is the rationale for Brownie J's
determination that a statement of instructions to implement was an implied
promise to implement within the meaning of the Bowstead statement of principle.
It amounted to an assurance to implement.
<P>

77   	In the present case, Ms Linden's response to receipt of
the authority was silence.  The authority was sent by Mr Orr to the
defendants
on 12 October 1990.  Mr Orr's claim under the authority varied from time to
time with changes of circumstances, including
payment on account by Mr Nove and
further work being done.  The balance of costs and disbursements asserted by Mr
Orr to be payable
was notified by him to Ms Linden on 15 November 1990, 21
December 1990 and 6 February 1991.  There was no response by Ms Linden to
any
of these communications.  (That is not said in criticism.  I am not suggesting
that a response was required.)
<P>

78   	By 6 February 1991, if not before, the absence of any
suggestion by Ms Linden that she did not intend to implement the authority
constituted an implied assurance that she did.  A solicitor in Mr Orr's
position would have construed her silence in that way, as
Mr Orr did.  A
reasonable solicitor in Ms Linden's position would have expected that to be the
reaction.  There is no suggestion
that Ms Linden herself did not expect it to
be the reaction.
<P>

79   	Under the Bowstead principle, once such an assurance was
given the defendants were bound by the instrument to account to Mr
Orr.  
<P>

80   	Does it matter that the authority did not specify an
amount to be held?  I think not, in the circumstances of this case. 
The
context made it clear that the costs and disbursements referred to in the
authority were such costs and disbursements as were
payable and might become
payable by Mr Nove to Mr Orr in relation to the Family Court proceedings.  That
carried the implication
of "reasonably payable".  It also carried the
implication that any amount reasonably claimed to be held on account of costs
and disbursements,
pending taxation, should be deducted from the proceeds of
sale of the Tyagarah property and held on account.  There was no objection
to
the quantum of the claim made from time to time by Mr Orr.  That was an implied
admission that the amount claimed from time to
time was reasonable as an amount
to be held on account for payment to Mr Orr if there was to be no taxation of
costs or to be held
pending any such taxation of costs.
<P>

81   	No question arises as to the quantification of damages.
The liability is not a liability in damages.  
<P>

82   	No question of laches arises, the claim not being one for
equitable relief.
<P>

83   	The balance of taxed costs payable by Mr Nove was,
ultimately, $27,116.  Mr Orr is entitled to judgment in that amount plus
interest.  A case has not been made for interest otherwise than pursuant to s
94 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a></i>.
<P>

84   	Tentatively, it does not appear to me that Ms Linden, as
distinct from the first and second defendants, is liable under this
approach.
The point has not been argued.  If necessary, it can be argued.
<P>

85   	In view of my decision under the first of the plaintiff's
approaches, it is unnecessary to determine the other grounds on
which the
plaintiff puts his case.  Were there more money involved, I would give
consideration to doing so, but further expenditure
of judicial time is not
warranted having regard to the amount involved.
<P>

86   	The parties should bring in short minutes of order to
implement this judgment.
<P>
