<b>					<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by summons filed 24 November 1998
seeks a declaration that the notice issued by the defendants to the plaintiff
under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (as amended) is
invalid.  Alternatively the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the notice
constitutes an abuse of process;
 a declaration that the plaintiff has a
reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the notice and a declaration that
the notice
is invalid to the extent that it requires the plaintiff to produce
documents or provide information which are subject to client legal
privilege or
which are otherwise confidential.  
<P>

2  	The second defendant filed a notice of motion returnable
instanter seeking that it be removed as a party to the proceedings.
 This order
was opposed by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff relied on the affidavit of
Rosemary MacDougal sworn 23 November 1998.  The
defendants did not rely upon
any affidavit evidence.
<P>

3  	For the purposes of this application I find the following
facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is the principal solicitor practising with the firm of
Gridiger &amp; Co in Sydney.  He is also a director of
Obelisk Securities Pty
Limited (Obelisk).  Obelisk carried on business as a trustee company and one of
its main activities was arranging
commercial loans.  Clients of Gridiger &amp;
Co contributed funds to Obelisk.  In these loan transactions the plaintiff
acted for
Obelisk.  These loans were usually secured by mortgages.
<P>

(2)	In July 1995 Mr Cardakaris in conjunction with Cardakaris Bros Pty Limited,
Gregory John Sealby, Dennis Caris and Emanuel Caris
(collectively described as
"the borrowers") approached the plaintiff through a mortgage broker in relation
to securing a loan to
repay a debt to Westpac Banking Corporation.  A deed of
facility agreement dated 19 July 1995 was executed between Obelisk and the
borrowers pursuant to which Obelisk agreed to loan to the borrower the sum of
$2,000,036 for a period of 12 months in return for
a number of first mortgages
over properties held by the borrowers (the refinancing transaction).
<P>

(3)	At the time the deed of facility agreement was signed, all of the borrowers
signed documents which acknowledged that they had
received legal advice about
the nature of the documents they were signing and that they understood the
extent of their obligations
contained in the documents.  Mr Cardakaris signed
such an acknowledgment in the presence of the solicitor he retained to act on
his
behalf in the refinancing transaction.  Mr Cassim the solicitor signed a
document headed "Solicitor's Certification" acknowledging
that he had explained
to them the contents and effect of the deed of facility agreement.
<P>

(4)	The relevant portion of the Acceptance document stated that the mortgagors
agreed
<P>

<b>"4.	Should this Mortgage not proceed for any reason whatsoever other than
your default, the Mortgagors shall pay your proper legal
costs which shall be
assessed at [$60,000] (and we waive our right to have the bill taxed) and
disbursements, insurance premium,
stamp duty (if any) and any other costs
properly incurred by you to the date of your receipt of notice in writing that
the Mortgage
is not proceeding.</b>
<P>

<b>6.	Agrees to pay Gridiger &amp;Co, Solicitors</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	an administration fee on the date of settlement calculated at the rate
of 0.75% on the principal sum;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	a collection fee calculated at the rate of 0.75% on any interest or
other payment under the mortgage such collection fee to be
paid at the time of
and in addition to the making of instalments of interest as provided
herein."</b>
<P>

(5)	On 24 July 1995 Gridiger &amp; Co forwarded a memorandum of costs and
disbursements to Mr Cardakaris .  The memorandum of costs
and disbursements was
expressed to be for professional costs and disbursements for acting on mortgage
advance by Obelisk and also
for an administration fee which also included
disbursements.  Professional costs were $60,000, the administration fee of
$15,225
and disbursements amounted to $2,281.54.  The total of the bill was
$77,506.54.
<P>

(6)	Soon after 20 July 1995 the borrowers defaulted on the terms of the loan
provided by Obelisk.  The properties were eventually
sold at auction.  
<P>

(7)	Proceedings were commenced by Mr Sealby in the Equity division of the
Supreme Court on 20 June 1996 against Obelisk, the plaintiff
and Nicholas
Cassim (the Equity proceedings).  The further amended statement of claim
alleged that the securities taken by Obelisk
in 1995 had been obtained by the
plaintiff in breach of his fiduciary duty to the borrowers as their solicitor
and were unenforceable.
 The plaintiff cross claimed against Sealby and sought
an order that the costs agreement be rectified so as to make it clear that
it
was an agreement between a solicitor and mortgagors.  Judgment was handed by
Santow J in the Equity proceedings on 5 November
1997.  His Honour held that
the plaintiff did not act as a solicitor for Mr Sealby in relation to the
refinancing transaction and
as such no fiduciary duty could arise.  He also
held that the plaintiff should succeed in his amended cross claim and the costs
agreement
be rectified and ordered accordingly.
<P>

(8)	On or about 27 May 1997 Mr Cardakaris made a complaint to the office of the
Legal Services Commissioner concerning the plaintiff's
conduct.  He complained
and alleged that firstly he was not advised well at the initial interview with
the plaintiff;  secondly,
that the plaintiff did not disclose his personal
interest in Obelisk;  thirdly, he did not comply with an undertaking in a
financial
matter;  fourthly, dishonesty;  fifthly, that the plaintiff did not
act in Mr Cardakaris's best interests and sixthly, that he was
made to pay the
very high bill under extreme pressure.
<P>

(9)	The Professional Standards Committee by delegation of the Council of the
Law Society is currently investigating Mr Cardakaris's
complaint.
<P>

(10)	On 5 November 1998 a notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> of the Act was issued on Law
Society letterhead to the plaintiff.  The relevant parts read as follows:
<P>

<b><u>FURTHER RESOLVED</u> that if the legal practitioner is unable to comply

<P>

<b>Dated this 5th November 1998</b>
<P>

<b>For the Council of the Law Society of New South Wales</b>
<P>

<b>(signed)</b>
<P>

<b>................................</b>
<P>

<b>Manager,</b>
<P>

<b>Professional Standards Department </b>
<P>

<b>Law Society of New South Wales</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

4  	It is common ground between the parties that there is no
solicitor/client relationship, fiduciary relationship or contractual
relationship between Mr Gridiger and Mr Cardakaris.
<P>

5  	In relation as to whether the second defendant should be removed
from the proceedings, the summons names Roland Errol Gridiger
as plaintiff, the
Council of the Law Society of New South Wales as first defendant and the Law
Society of New South Wales as second
defendant.  Section 157 of the Act refers
to the delegation by Council.
<P>

<b>"Delegation by Council</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A Council may delegate to any of its committees the exercise of any or
all of its functions under this Division, other than this
power of
delegation.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Such a delegation may be made only to a committee whose presiding member
is a member of the Council."</b>
<P>

6  	The notice issued refers to the Professional Conduct Committee of
the Law Society of New South Wales and the powers delegated
to it by the
Council of the Law Society.  It also refers to resolutions of the Professional
Conduct Committee.  The plaintiff says
that the Council is the correct
defendant whereas the plaintiff submitted that the Council comprised of
individuals who are elected
each year and if the plaintiff wishes to enforce a
costs order then it would have to join the individuals who were Council members
at that particular time.  If the plaintiff is successful in obtaining a costs
order in his favour the second defendant would not
be an inappropriate
defendant and on that basis the second defendant should not be removed as a
party to the proceedings.
<P>

7  	The plaintiff submitted that the notice is invalid on six grounds
namely, firstly, there is no complaint of the kind that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the Act
contemplates;  secondly, a complaint of overcharging is not authorised under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Parts 10</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">11</a>;  thirdly, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> only requires the plaintiff to provide
information or produce documents and does not extend to the creation of
documents;  fourthly,
the information sought in the notice amounts to a fishing
expedition;  fifthly, the notice does not comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> and sixthly, the
notice requires the disclosure of confidential information and of documents
subject to legal professional privilege.
<P>

8  	The defendants submitted that firstly, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> allows persons to
make complaints;  secondly both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Parts 10</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> are applicable;  thirdly, the
creation of a new document is authorised;  fourthly, the documents and
information sought are relevant;
 fifthly, the notice complies with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> and
sixthly, if some of the information requested is the subject of confidentiality
or legal professional privilege, the plaintiff
can decline to provide the
information on that basis but it does not mean that the whole notice is
invalid.
<P>

9  	The relevant portions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b>
1987 (NSW) (as amended) provides:
<P>

<b>"Powers of Council or Commissioner when investigating complaint</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	For the purpose of investigating a complaint, a Council or the
Commissioner may, by notice in writing served on any legal practitioner
or
interstate legal practitioner, require the legal practitioner or interstate
legal practitioner to do any one or more of the following:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	to provide written information, by a date specified in the notice, and
to verify the information by statutory declaration,</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	to produce, at a time and place specified in the notice, any document
(or a copy of any document) specified in the notice,</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	to otherwise assist in, or cooperate with, the investigation of the
complaint in a specified manner.</b>
<P>

<b>(1A)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	A requirement under this section is to be notified in writing to the
legal practitioner or interstate legal practitioner and is
to specify a
reasonable time for compliance.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	A legal practitioner or interstate legal practitioner who, without
reasonable excuse, fails to comply with such a requirement
is guilty of
professional misconduct.</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	A legal practitioner or interstate legal practitioner must not mislead
or obstruct a Council or the Commissioner in the exercise
of any function under
this Division.  The wilful contravention of this subsection is capable of being
professional misconduct."</b>
<P>

10  	I turn to the plaintiff's first submission that there is no
complaint of the kind contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act</a></b> 1987 (the Act) that can be the basis of investigation and that the
issue of a s 152 notice constitutes an abuse of process.  This
was referred to
as "the no jurisdiction argument".  The defendants submitted that to find that
there was no complaint in accordance
with Part 10 involves a reading down of s
124(a) and in various places the Act draws numerous distinctions between
persons and users
of legal services.  The defendants say that s 124(a) should
be given its literal meaning.  The defendants submit that parliament
intended
that subsections (a) and (b) have different meanings and that s 124(a) was
intended to cast a very wide net.  According
to the defendants Part 10
contemplates that any person can complain about legal practitioners and that
there are safeguards such
as s 141 of the Act where it empowers the
commissioner to summarily dismiss a complaint.
<P>

11  	Part 10 is entitled "Complaints and Discipline".  The general
object of Part 10 is set out in s 123 and includes as one of
the objects to
maintain at a sufficiently high level the ethical and practice standards of the
legal profession as a whole.  
<P>

12  	Section 124 sets out the objects of the part relating to users
of legal services.  It relevantly reads:
<P>

<b>"(a)	to give every person the right to complaint about the conduct of legal
practitioners and interstate legal practitioners, and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	to give users of legal services access to sufficient advice and
assistance in order to make and pursue complaints in accordance
with this Part
and to understand their rights and responsibilities under this Part."</b>
<P>

13  	Section 125 sets out the objects of the part relating to
providers of legal services.
<P>

14  	Sections 123, 124 and 125 are sections which set out the objects
of Part 10. While the words in the objects clause namely ss
123, 124 and 125 of
the Act assist in the interpretation of any ambiguities in the legislation they
cannot prevail over the words
plainly expressed - see <b><u>Searle Australia
Pty Limited v Public Interest Advocacy Centre</u></b><u> </u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2032%20FCR%20111" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 32 FCR 111</a>
at pp 114-115.
<P>

15  	Section 134 is a specific provision and is contained in Division
3 of Part 10.  Division 3 is headed complaints about legal
practitioners.
<P>

<b>"Right to make complaint to Commissioner</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Any person may make a complaint to the Commissioner about the conduct of
a legal practitioner or interstate legal practitioner.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Any such complaint that is duly made is to be dealt with in accordance
with this Part.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	This section does not affect any other right of a person to complain
about the conduct of a legal practitioner or interstate legal
practitioner."</b>
<P>

16  	The words of s 134 are plainly expressed.  Section 134 states
that any person may make a complaint.  That person does not have
to be a user
of legal services.  It is my view that s 137 is not ambiguous and there is no
need to refer to the objects clauses namely
ss 123, 124 and 125 of the Act.  In
any event, Part 10 makes references to both persons and users of legal
services.  They are intended
to have different meanings.  Any person can lodge
a complaint under Part 10 of the Act.  He or she does not have to be a user of
legal services.  The complaint is one contemplated by Part 10 of the Act.
<P>

17  	Secondly the plaintiff submitted that if there be a complaint in
accordance with Part 10, the part of the complaint dealing
with overcharging is
not a valid complaint which is authorised either under Part 10 or Part 11.
According to the plaintiff it is
not a proper complaint under Part 11 because
that part refers to costs payable as between solicitor and client and Mr
Cardakaris
was not a client of the plaintiff.  The defendants do not concede
that Part 11 is necessarily inapplicable to the complaint.  According
to the
second defendant s 199(4) of the Act which falls in Part 11 is an inclusive
definition of client not an exhaustive one.  It
is arguable that the definition
of client is intended to cover the person who is ultimately responsible to pay
the fees.  The defendant
submitted that even if Part 11 does not apply it does
not mean that the complaint cannot be investigated under Part 10 and that the
Professional Conduct Committee can engage an independent costs expert to assist
their investigation.  After such an investigation
the Committee of the Law
Society may approach the Supreme Court in their inherent jurisdiction.  
<P>

18  	Division 5 in Part 10 is headed Investigations of Complaints.
Section 148 deals with the investigation of complaints by Council.
 Section 148
(i) states that the Council must conduct an investigation into each complaint
referred to it by the Commissioner or
initiated by the Council.  Part 10 and in
particular s 134 define a complaint in wide terms.  As previously stated the
nature of
a complaint is not limited.  The complaint may be about the conduct
of a legal practitioner which may include such subject matter
as
overcharging.
<P>

19  	It is my view that the scope of the investigation by the Council
includes the complaints of the type raised by Mr Cardakaris.
 
<P>

20  	It is not necessary to determine whether Part 11 is applicable
to Mr Cardakaris's complaints regarding the excessive amount
of the bill.
However, s 184 defines a costs agreement as between a solicitor who is retained
by the client to provide the legal services
and it would seem that as Mr
Cardakaris was not a client he cannot be said to have a costs agreement.
<P>

21  	The defendant referred to <b><u>Touzell v Cawthorn</u></b>
(NSWSC unreported 6 October 1995) where Young J said:
<P>

<b>"...Even though there have been amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a> which
seem to remove some rights of those who pay the bills rendered by solicitors,
the Court still retains its inherent power, and
for the reasons </b>
<P>

<b>I have explained in <i>Parramatta River Lodge Pty Ltd v Sunman</i> (1991) 5
BPR 12,038, at least on terms of payment of the costs of the bill, the Court
will compel a solicitor to give details of
his or her charges to any person who
has actually to pay the bill."</b>
<P>

22  	The court has inherent power to compel a solicitor to give
details of his or her charges to pay the bill.  Mr Cardakaris could
approach
the court and seek an order that the plaintiff give details of his charges to
him.  Whether the court would exercise that
inherent power in relation to the
Law Society involves different considerations.  It is an option to be taken
into account by the
Professional Standards Committee when they investigate the
complaint.  
<P>

23  	The plaintiff also submitted that this was not a case of
overcharging because Mr Gridiger did not place his trust in the plaintiff.
 He
had the benefit of separate independent legal advice.  The rationale in
relation to overcharging was explained by Kirby P in
<b><u>Veghelyi v The Law
Society of New South Wales</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 6 October 1995) at page 7
where he said:
<P>

<b>"Clients are, or may frequently be, in a vulnerable position vis-a-vis their
solicitors; the presumption of undue influence is, I
think, based at least in
part upon the fact that when making decisions clients ordinarily or at least
frequently place trust in their
solicitors. They ordinarily are not in a
position to know without investigation what work must be done and what charges
are fair
and reasonable; they ordinarily assume that the solicitor will make
only such charges.</b>
<P>

<b>Solicitors are, on the other hand, informed, or in a position to inform
themselves, of what work may be required and what are fair
and reasonable
charges. They are, in that sense, in a position of advantage and trust is
placed in them. Clients are entitled to
be protected against the abuse of such
an advantage. It is, I am inclined to think, the fact that that advantage has
been misused
which may, in a particular case, warrant what the solicitor does
being categorised as professional misconduct."</b>
<P>

24  	As previously stated, the defendants are entitled to investigate
Mr Cardakaris's complaint under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the Act. This submission concerning
overcharging may be one that the plaintiff wishes to place before the
Committee.
<P>

25  	Thirdly, the  plaintiff submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> only permits the
committee to require information or the production of documents and that duty
does not encompass a requirement to
create a document such as a bill of costs.
The defendants submitted that the compiling of information may involve the
plaintiff putting
pen to paper and compiling a document.  It is my view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
152(1)(a)</a> requires the legal practitioner to provide written information.  To
provide such information may require the plaintiff to compile
information and
commit that information to writing.
<P>

26  	Fourthly, the plaintiff submitted the information and documents
that are required to be produced constitute a fishing expedition.
 The
defendant says that the plaintiff has embarked on a fishing expedition.  The
documents sought are specifically identified and
are relevant to the issues of
the nature of the work for which Mr Cardakaris was liable to pay whether the
amount charged was excessive.
 They are relevant to the issues raised in the
complaint.  It is my view the defendants are not embarking on a fishing
expedition.
<P>

27  	Fifthly, the plaintiff submitted the form of the notice did not
comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> of the Act as there is a purported exercise of powers of the
Professional Conduct Committee as part of the Law Society and not the
Council.
The plaintiff submitted that it is unclear on the form of the notice who has
issued it as the letterhead refers to the Law
Society New South Wales and that
the resolution cannot be signed by an individual but has to be signed under the
seal of the Committee
or by the Chairman of the Committee.  The defendants say
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> does not prescribe a form.  All that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> requires is a notice in
writing.  However the defendant concedes that the reference to the Professional
Committee of the Law Society
is incorrect.  However according to the defendants
this is not of overall significance because on page 3 of the documents the
correct
position is stated.  According to the defendant it does not matter who
signed it as it can be signed by anyone.  In any event it
is clear on the face
of the first page of the document that the Law Society Council has delegated
its power of law to the Professional
Conduct Committee.
<P>

28 The plaintiff referred to the <b><u>Minister for Natural Resources v
New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council &amp; Anor</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20NSWLR%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 9 NSWLR 154</a>
at 164 where McHugh JA referred to the fundamental maxim of the law is the
maxim `<i>omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta</i>'.  It has many
applications...The wheels of business will not go smoothly round unless it may
be assumed that that is in order which
appears to be in order.  
<P>

29  	The notice could have been drafted in clearer terms.  The notice
refers to the Professional Conduct Committee of the Law Society
exercising the
powers delegated to it by the Council of the Law Society of New South Wales.
However, upon a reading of the document
it is plain that the Professional
Conduct Committee is investigating a complaint under the delegated powers by
the Council of the
Law Society of New South Wales.  While the resolutions
themselves may have to be made under seal and signed by the Chairperson, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a>
specifically refers to a requirement that the notice be in writing.  It does
not specify that it must be signed under seal.  It is
my view that the notice
provided to the plaintiff complies with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152.</a>
<P>

30  	The plaintiff's final submission was that the notice should be
set aside because it requires the plaintiff to disclose either
confidential
information or the documents are subject to legal professional privilege.  The
plaintiff conceded that it perhaps does
not make the whole of the notice
invalid but the issue of the notice puts the plaintiff in jeopardy of falling
foul of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152(4)</a> and can be found guilty of professional misconduct.  However
the defendants submitted that the notice is not invalid but the plaintiff
can
decline to provide certain documents on the grounds that they are the subject
of confidentiality or legal professional privilege.
 It was agreed between the
parties that Obelisk had not consented to the provision of this information.
The defendants referred to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s171.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 171(S)(2)</a> of the Act which provides that the
plaintiff can disclose a matter to the Council in breach of a duty of
confidentiality if the Council
is satisfied that it is necessary for the
practitioner to do so in order to rebut an allegation in the complaint.  Of
course, it
may not be in the plaintiff's interest to avail himself of the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s171.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 171(S)(2).</a>
<P>

31  	The documents sought in schedule 2, such as copies of the
mortgage transaction document, trust and office account ledgers,
a copy of the
bill of costs which Mr Cardakaris was liable to pay would not necessarily be
the subject of confidentiality nor legal
professional privilege.  The whole
notice cannot be said to be invalid because it seeks some documents which may
be of a confidential
nature or subject to legal professional privilege.  The
plaintiff may decline to provide other documents on the basis that the
documents
are subject to confidentiality or legal professional privilege and
may or may not decide to avail himself of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s171.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 171</a> (s)(2).
<P>

32  	The plaintiff has not established that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 152</a> notice should
be set aside.  Nor has he established that it is an abuse of process.  I
dismiss the second defendant's notice of motion.
 I dismiss the summons.  Costs
should follow the events.  In the event these costs are the subject of a costs
assessment application
it should be noted that the defendants' notice of motion
took a minimal time to argue.
<P>

33  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The second defendant's notice of motion is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The second defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the notice of
motion.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of the summons.
<P>
