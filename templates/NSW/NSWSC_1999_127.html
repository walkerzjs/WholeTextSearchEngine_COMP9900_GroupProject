<b>4669/98  -  STONE GROUP ASIA PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LIMITED   v JOHNSON TAYLOR
CORPORATE LIMITED</b>
<P>

	JUDGMENT
<P>

1	MASTER:  This matter is an application to set aside a statutory demand which
was served by the defendant on the plaintiff.  The
statutory demand is dated 26
October 1998 and claims the sum of $102,400.   The debt is said to be for an
underwriting commission
and management fee pursuant to an underwriting
agreement between the parties as varied on 10 September 1998.
<P>

2		The claim for the underwriting fees concerns a capital raising which was
done on behalf of the plaintiff.   The capital to be
raised was approximately
$3.3 million and was not completely successful in that the whole amount was not
raised.
<P>

3		The reasons why the statutory demand is sought to be set aside is that it is
said that there is on offsetting claim either equal
to or greater than the
amount sought in the demand.
<P>

4		The basis of the offsetting claim is not the failure to raise the
appropriate amount of capital, which was accepted, but another
matter which
seems to be on the periphery of the documentation which really relates to
another desire of the plaintiff company, which
was to increase its shareholder
spread.   Apparently it has some 200 shareholders and wanted to increase that
to 300 in order to
satisfy the Stock Exchange and the listing requirements.
<P>

5		There have been given in evidence a number of what might be described as
pre-contractual representations.   They are three in
all.  The first appears in
par.12 of the affidavit of Mr Cheng who is the secretary of the plaintiff
company, which was sworn 16
November 1998.  In a discussion with persons from
the defendant Mr Cheng in response to a question asked about shareholdings said
he was told by the defendant's private client stockbroker that they had
thirty-five very good licensed advisers, they usually had
a good client base
and should be able to give the spread.
<P>

6		Some time later, on 15 June, there was a further conversation (see par.15)
in which Mr Cheng raised the fact that in fact they
only had about 300
shareholders and wanted 200 more.  The defendants stated that they would help
and indicated that the defendant
would have eighty-five advisers by 1 July 1998
and would have the capacity to help the plaintiff.  They said, "We should get
you
the shareholders you need, at least 100 or more".  Mr Cheng replied, "We
want that in writing".
<P>

7		The following day, 26 June, a letter was sent in respect of the general
arrangements and the shareholder spread was addressed
in that.  The letter
said:
<P>

	"We refer you to cl.2.3 of the underwriting agreement.  We are acutely
conscious of the need in this case to increase the shareholder
spread of Stone
and we shall do everything possible to achieve a positive result for you.
Whilst we can give no absolute assurances,
it is reasonable for you to assume
that we can deliver a further 100 shareholders and hopefully many more as part
of the process".
<P>

8		These representations were all made prior to the execution of the
underwriting agreement which obviously was in draft form because
there was a
reference to it in that letter.
<P>

	Clause 2.3 of the underwriting agreement provides:
<P>

	"Marketing.  The underwriter agrees to use reasonable endeavours (short of
paying additional fees or commissions) to encourage
its sub-underwriting
brokers to promote the Rights Issue among their clients in an effort to procure
applications in respect of a
shortfall, from as many non-members as is
reasonably practical".
<P>

9		The full amount was not raised but that is not the matter of complaint.
Only a few shareholders responded, some of those being
existing ones and
certainly the additional 100 shareholders were not achieved.
<P>

10		There are a number of matters which have been raised which it is said cause
the application to fail.  The first of these was
evidence of the quantification
of the offseting claim.  In his affidavit Mr Cheng does not in any way deal
with the question of the
offset other than in par.28 where he annexes a letter
of 9 November 1998 from his solicitors to the other side.  That letter, because
it was written at a time when clearly the parties were contemplating
litigation, the demand having been issued, is not admissible
as a business
record.  It was admitted on a limited basis under s.136 because as evidence
only of the assertion and not evidence
of the truth of the facts asserted.
That letter in its terms does make a claim or an assertion as to what is the
loss in damages.
 There were in fact seven matters:
<P>

	Legal fees, balance                  $54,632.48
<P>

	Printing and artwork (prospectus)    $26,345.00
<P>

	Independent expert's report          $17,500.00
<P>

	Independent accountant's opinion      $5,000.00
<P>

	Consulting fees 
<P>

		(non executive directors)       $57,069.05
<P>

	Air fare and accommodation expenses  $12,882.80
<P>

	Lost subscriptions (99 x 2000)      $198,000.00
<P>

	Total                               $371,429.33
<P>

11	As I have said, this is an assertion of damage and there is no evidence of
it.  This is somewhat important because if one pauses
and considers the context
in which this claim is made one has to bear in mind that there has been a
partially successful capital
raising which has gone ahead and, quite obviously,
a number of the expenses would relate to that capital raising.  How they could
be described as damages suffered in respect of the limited matter complained of
is simply not apparent.  For instance the expert's
reports, accountant's
opinion, clearly all relate to matters concerned with the capital raising,
which was successful to an extent.
<P>

12		There is then this elliptical description of lost subscriptions.  What that
refers to is not explained and how it is quantified
is also not explained.  In
other words one has assertions of matters which on their face might well not be
related to the representation
which is complained about, but in fact to the
capital raising which went ahead.
<P>

13		It has been urged on me that one has to have regard to these matters at a
somewhat different level in evidentiary terms.  Certainly
in the context of
considering whether an affidavit is a sufficient affidavit for the purposes of
the section, somewhat less strictness
applies.  The matter has been dealt with
in a number of cases and recently in <b>Zenoust Imports  v  Alembic Chemical
Works Ltd</b> at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=28%20ASCR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">28 ASCR 465</a> where Santow J dealt with the extent to which an
affidavit has to articulate the extent of the offsetting claim if it is to meet
the minimum requirements.  I hasten to add that in the present case the case
has not been argued upon this basis but simply on the
basis that there is no
evidence of the amount of the claim.
<P>

14		However I do note in that case his Honour's view that the level of
articulation is not high.  There is a difference between
that case and
<b>Sacron Constructions Pty Ltd  v  Concrite Quarries Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%201303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15
ACLC 1303</a>, a decision of Emmett J.   The affidavit in that case merely asserted
a cross-claim equal to or greater than the amount claimed.
<P>

15		In the present case the affidavit in support does not even do this.
Although I do note that in par.3 it says there is no agreement
that the
plaintiff has an offsetting claim.
<P>

16		Accordingly it does seem to me that when one comes to look at the question
of what is the amount of the offsetting claim the
court has to have some
evidence on which it can base its decision.  This is because the section
requires it to determine the admitted
amount after determining the amount of
the offsetting claim.
<P>

17		Given the complete lack of explanation as to how the damages arise I think
to even accept an assertion in respect of it is not
appropriate.  Accordingly I
am not satisfied that there has been demonstrated an offsetting claim.
<P>

18		Another matter which has to be looked at is the question of the nature of
the representation.  If one looks at representations
as to future conduct, they
are what will be obtained in the future by way of additional shareholders in
the company.  That raises
a problem of what is the necessary proof of the
falsity of the representations as to future conduct.  The matter arises because
the
claims are both under s.51 and 51A(i) of the Trade Practices Act.  Under
s.51A there is special provision dealing with the matter.
 Section 51A(i) deems
the representations as to a future matter misleading unless the corporation had
reasonable grounds for making
it and under sub-s(ii) the onus of proof of
reasonable grounds rests with the corporation making the statement.
<P>

19		In the present case the plaintiff has led absolutely no evidence of falsity
of promise.  The fact that the result was not achieved
does not in any way
prove the falsity of the promise.   More is necessary.
<P>

20		In contrast if one looks at the evidence which has been put forward by the
defendant one has a letter marked 30 October 1998
which details all the efforts
made by the defendant to spread the possibility of the clients' shares amongst
other brokers around
Australia.  There is listed a large number of brokers who
have been contacted and there was discussion about the level of interest
generated in the presentation.  There is then reference to a critical factor in
the lack of success in attracting investors being
the fact that the share
market over this time was below the issue price.  It was said there was no
incentive for investors to buy
new issue shares.
<P>

21		Accordingly the only evidence of falsity which has been put forward would
suggest that the defendant took reasonable steps to
promote it.  One might
infer they had reasonable grounds for making the statements.  For this reason I
think also that there has
been a failure to prove that there is an offsetting
claim.  Accordingly it seems to me that the offsetting claim had not been made
out and accordingly I dismiss the summons and order the plaintiff to pay the
defendant's costs.
<P>
