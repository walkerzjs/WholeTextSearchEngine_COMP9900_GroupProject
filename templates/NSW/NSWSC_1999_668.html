<i>Thursday, 2 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1531/99	FEMLEY PTY LIMITED &amp; ORS   -v-   SALKEN ENGINEERING PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>Femley Pty Limited, Taylor Lea Pty Limited
and Keogh Pty Limited each claim an order that the creditor's statutory demand
served by
the defendant Salken Engineering Pty Limited on that plaintiff on 2
February 1999 be set aside pursuant to section 459G of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>.
<P>

2   	Three separate statutory demands were served, one upon each
of the plaintiff companies.  Each of those demands is in identical
form.  Each
claims payment by the plaintiff upon which it was served of the amount of
$80,000.  That amount is described in the schedule
to the demand as follows:
Progress payment owed pursuant to agreement dated on or about 11 November 1998
for which the company has
been invoiced $80,000.
<P>

3   	A number of procedural aspects to this matter were the
subject of a judgment delivered by Santow J on 15 April 1999.
<P>

4   	The consequence of his Honour's decision on those aspects
is that the only question which is before the Court in the present
hearing is
whether the plaintiff companies have established, as is contemplated by section
459H(1), that there is a genuine dispute
between the company and the defendant
about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff companies are the partners in a partnership
known as ARQ Sydney Partnership (referred to as "ARQ").  The agreement
referred
to in the schedule is an agreement which emerges from correspondence passing
between the defendant and Mr Christopher Curtis
in November 1998.
<P>

6   	Mr Curtis is a director of Taylor Lea Pty Limited, the
first plaintiff, and acts on behalf of the partnership in its dealings
with the
defendant.
<P>

7   	The partnership is in the process of completing the
development of an entertainment venue at 16 Flinders Street, Taylor Square
in
Sydney.
<P>

8   	The arrangement which was the subject of the correspondence
between the defendant and Mr Curtis in November 1998 related to
the
construction and supply by the defendant of what has been referred to as a
lighting grid structure for that entertainment venue.
<P>

9   	I should here record that both at the time when the hearing
of this matter was fixed to heard today before me and at the commencement
of
today's hearing, I stated, and had it recorded, that I am acquainted with Mr
Curtis, who is a practising barrister.  That fact
did not occasion any problem
for any of the parties to the proceedings to my hearing the matter.
<P>

10   	The letter dated 6 November 1998 from the defendant, to Mr
Curtis, referred to the total cost of the work, the subject of
the letter,
being in a total amount of $207,320.00.  Provision was made for a deposit of 25
per cent of the total amount, such deposit
to be in an amount of $51,830 being,
"required prior to the commencement of the undertaking being for securement of
US sourced service
and equipment and also as working capital for the
development of locally designed product type equipment and resources".
<P>

11   	That letter also provided, "Upon the successful completion
and acceptance of the design product device and prior to installation,
a
further 25 per cent of the above total will be payable".
<P>

12   	Although not specified in the statutory demand, the
$80,000 claimed therein was, during the course of the hearing, identified
to
Counsel for the defendant as comprising two components.  The first of those two
components is in an amount of $30,000 and is in
a distinct amount, being the
balance of the deposit referred to in the letter of 6 November 1998.
<P>

13   	Although that letter refers to a deposit of $51,830, a
subsequent variation in what was to be performed by the defendant resulted
in
the defendant adopting a total price for the work of $200,000 rather than
$207,820.  In consequence therefore, the defendant calculated
the deposit.  It
was identified as being 25 per cent of $200,000, that is $50,000.
<P>

14   	In December 1998 an amount of $20,000 was paid by the
plaintiffs to the defendant.  The process of identification of the basis
for
the payment of that amount and whether it constituted part of the deposit or
might be characterised in some other fashion, has
not been conceded by the
plaintiffs.
<P>

15   	Nevertheless, the defendant has chosen to treat that
payment as being part of the $50,000 deposit.  In consequence, therefore,
the
defendant asserts that the balance of the deposit in an amount of $30,000 is
payable.  
<P>

16   	The other component of the $80,000 is an amount of
$50,000.  That amount is claimed as being the further 25 per cent of the
$200,000 which would become payable upon the successful completion and
acceptance of the design product device.
<P>

17   	In proceedings such as the present, it is not necessary
for the Court to express a concluded view as to whether or not one
party or
another at a final hearing would be successful.  The Court is required by
subsection (1) of section 459H of the <i>Corporations Law </i>only to be
satisfied of either or both of the following matters:  that there is a genuine
dispute between the company and the respondent
about the existence or the
amount of debt to which the demand relates; or that the company has an
off-setting claim.
<P>

18   	There is abundant evidence in the present case that the
design product type of the lighting grid structure was a matter which
was the
subject of dispute between the parties and that no such design product type was
accepted by the plaintiffs.
<P>

19   	Although the defendant did not concede the existence of a
dispute, nevertheless, the submissions made by the defendant that
there was no
genuine dispute in that regard were of a somewhat formal nature.
<P>

20   	I am satisfied that there is a genuine dispute concerning
the component of the demand in the amount of $50,000 representing
the payment
of 25 per cent of $200,000 to which the defendant would be entitled upon the
successful completion and acceptance of
the design product types.
<P>

21   	There remains to be considered the other component, being
$30,000, asserted by the defendant to be the balance of the deposit.
<P>

22   	In the correspondence which constituted the arrangement
between the parties in November 1998, there was reference to cladding
of the
lighting grid structure and there was reference to panelling of the lighting
grid structure.  It was asserted by the plaintiffs
that the agreed price
included panelling but did not include cladding of the structure. 
<P>

23   	On the other hand, it was asserted by the defendant that
neither panelling nor cladding was included.  There was a further
complication
to this aspect of panelling or cladding in that the phrase "cladding" was, so
it was suggested on behalf of the defendant,
meant to encompass the concept of
external covering for the structure, that is, that the phrase would have
included what the plaintiff
regarded as panelling.
<P>

24   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that
because the parties meant different things in their reference to cladding
and
panelling (both phrases being used in the correspondence at various points), no
binding contract came into existence between
the parties; and that, if no
binding contract came into effect, then the provisions in the correspondence
relating to the payment
of a deposit did not come into existence and thus no
deposit was payable.
<P>

25   	It seems to me that each of the parties acted as if there
were a binding agreement between them.  Certainly the correspondence
between
them was upon that footing.  The present defendant has instituted separate
proceedings, being proceedings 1467 of 1999, against
the present plaintiffs
seeking specific performance of the contract.
<P>

26   	As a final hearing, I am satisfied that the Court will
certainly conclude that there was in existence an agreement between
the parties
and if necessary will construe that agreement in relation to requirements for
cladding or for panelling and give to those
phrases appropriate
constructions.
<P>

27   	I do not accept the submission of the plaintiffs that, in
consequence of the parties meaning different things by those phrases,
no
enforceable contract came into existence.  I do not consider that submission to
be one which is properly arguable. In those circumstances,
that submission does
not preclude the plaintiffs from being liable for the payment of a deposit.
<P>

28   	The next submission made on behalf of the plaintiffs is
that it is arguable that, properly construed, the contract required
the
defendant to construct the grid with panelling, with the consequence that, if
the defendant did not do so, then the plaintiffs
would be entitled to damages.

<P>

29   	It was submitted that the two claims, that of the
defendant for wrongful termination by the plaintiffs of the contract (that
claim being the subject of the specific performance aspect to which I have
already referred) and any claim for damages by the present
plaintiffs against
the defendant, are so inexplicably bound up as to entitle the present
plaintiffs to an equitable set-off. There
is no further quantification of
damages to which the plaintiffs might, if ultimately successful, be entitled,
although it is submitted
that, in a total development costing $6 million, any
such damages would be likely to exceed the amount of $30,000, being the balance
of the deposit which the defendant is here claiming. I will return to the
question of damages shortly.  
<P>

30   	The next ground upon which the plaintiffs submit that they
are not liable to pay any part of the deposit is that, if the payment
of 25 per
cent described as the deposit in the letter of 6 November 1998 is a true
deposit and is not, in reality, a progress payment
then, if the plaintiffs have
validly terminated the contract which they purported to do, that deposit is
repayable to them.
<P>

31   	The plaintiffs purported to terminate the contract for
breach by the defendant.  The alleged breaches are referred to in the
letter of
21 January 1999 from the solicitors for the plaintiffs to the solicitors for
the defendant.
<P>

32   	Those breaches included the issues, to which I have
already adverted, relating to, firstly, the obligation of the defendant
to
provide panelling for the grid and the question whether that panelling was
encompassed in the phrase cladding; and, secondly,
the failure of the defendant
to give any firm commitment as to the state of completion of its work.
<P>

33   	It is not necessary for me to be persuaded that the
plaintiffs will be ultimately successful in their assertion that they
validly
terminated the contract upon the ground of those breaches.  It is necessary for
me only to be satisfied that it is arguable
that they may ultimately be
successful.
<P>

34   	I am satisfied that the asserted breaches in relation to
the questions of panelling and cladding and in relation to the failure
of the
defendant to give a commitment as to a date for completion of the contract are
arguably matters which would justify termination
of the contract.
<P>

35   	If so, then any deposit which might already have been paid
becomes repayable to the plaintiffs; and if the deposit has not
been paid, then
there would be no liability to pay it if the plaintiffs had validly terminated
the contract.
<P>

36   	It was also submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that the
asserted delay on the part of the defendant in the building and
installation of
the structure would justify termination of the contract and a claim for
damages, or at least damages for the delay.
 
<P>

37   	However, it would appear that the site did not become
available to the defendant until 25 January 1999, whilst the plaintiff
had
already purported on 22 January 1999 to terminate the contract. In those
circumstances, the matter of delay does not seem to
me to be an arguable
ground. But, as I have already indicated, the failure of the defendant to give
a firm commitment as to completion
date is an arguable ground for the
termination of the contract.
<P>

38   	The final matter relates to the question of damages. That
is the question whether, even if the defendant were entitled to
the balance of
the deposit (being the amount of $30,000), any arguable entitlement of the
plaintiffs to damages would equal or exceed
that amount.
<P>

39   	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that, since
there was a reference to a quotation for $7,580 for panelling, that
was the
most which the plaintiffs could receive by way of damages for the failure of
the defendant in that regard if the defendant
were ultimately held liable to
provide that panelling.
<P>

40   	The quotation does not contain details of the panelling to
show it is identical to the panelling which might have been the
subject of the
agreement with the defendant.
<P>

41   	However, Mr Mesner on behalf of the defendant agreed in
cross- examination agreed that the cost of the panelling could be
in the
vicinity of $40,000.  As I have already indicated, it is not necessary for me
to be satisfied that the plaintiff would, of
necessity, establish an
entitlement to $40,000 by way of damages for the panelling, but it is certainly
arguable the plaintiff could
establish such an amount.  That amount exceeds the
amount of $30,000 which is the balance of the deposit.
<P>

42   	Accordingly, it is my conclusion that there is a genuine
dispute as to the totality of the amount claimed in the statutory
demand, and I
propose therefore to make an order in the terms of prayer 1 in the summons.
<P>

43   	[DISCUSSION RE COSTS.]
<P>

44   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I make an order as in prayer 1 in the summons.
<P>

2.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiffs.
<P>

3.	I reserve the plaintiffs liberty to apply on seven days' notice to the
defendant and to any other person affected thereby for
variation of order 2
hereof, such liberty to be exercised within fourteen days hereof.
