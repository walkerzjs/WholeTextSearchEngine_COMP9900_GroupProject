<P>

<i>Wednesday, 14 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4857/98	RHODA ATHENE KARPIN   -v-   MARCUS BERNARD KARPIN &amp; 2 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   Last Friday, 9 April 1999, this matter was
referred to me as Duty Master by the Registrar. Since the estimated length of
hearing
was one hour and since I had other matters listed before me which were
expected to, and in the event did, occupy the entire day,
I specially fixed the
hearing of this matter before me for tomorrow, 15 April 1999.
<P>

2   	The proceedings are a claim by the plaintiff, Rhoda Athene
Karpin, for relief pursuant to Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act
</i>1919</a> and in particular for the appointment, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 66G</a>, of
statutory trustees for sale of certain real property. When the matter was
before me on 9 April, Mr Willmott of Counsel appeared
for the plaintiff and
Miss Merkel of Counsel appeared for the defendants Marcus Bernard Karpin, Alwin
Jacob Karpin and Caroline Karpin.
<P>

3   	In the course of my inquiry of Counsel concerning the
nature of the dispute before I fixed a date for hearing, I was informed
by Miss
Merkel, as a result of a specific question addressed to her by me in this
regard, that the defendants did not oppose the
appointment of the statutory
trustees for the sale of the land but they did oppose appointment of the
statutory trustee sought by
the plaintiff to be appointed.
<P>

4   	Before I fixed a hearing date, I stated and had it
recorded, that I was acquainted with one of the defendants, Alwin Jacob
Karpin,
and that I had had a professional relationship with him when I was in practice
at the Bar and he was a solicitor. I enquired
of each party whether that fact
caused any problem for that party to my hearing the matter. There was no
objection raised by either
the plaintiff or the defendants.
<P>

5   	This morning application is made by the first and second
defendants Marcus Bernard Karpin and Alwin Jacob Karpin, that I should
disqualify myself from the hearing of the matter.
<P>

6   	Mr Hodgson of Counsel has appeared today for those two
defendants. That application on behalf of those defendants has been
opposed by
Mr Willmott of Counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

7   	The basis upon which the present application that I should
disqualify myself is made upon the ground of what is compendiously
referred to
in the authorities as perceived  bias. It was stated by Mr Hodgson from the Bar
table that, according to his instructions,
the professional relationship
between Mr Karpin and myself ended on less than good terms. No evidence has
been placed before the
Court in support of that statement of instructions. It
would be quite improper for me to express in the course of the hearing of
that
application or in the course of my judgment, my own recollection of the terms
upon which a professional relationship between
myself as a barrister and an
instructing solicitor may have terminated upward of thirty years ago.
<P>

8   	There have been in recent times a considerable number of
decisions by courts of high authority concerning the disqualification
of a
judicial officer from hearing a matter. In <i>R v Grassby </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 1</a>
at 20, Dawson J, in dealing with what has been sometimes described as a
reasonable apprehension of bias, said:
<P>

The test which is to be applied when bias is raised has been clearly laid down.
It is whether in all the circumstances the parties
or the public might
entertain a reasonable apprehension that the judge might not bring an impartial
and unprejudiced mind to the
resolution of the matter before him: see
<i>Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 288</a>, <i>Reg v
Watson: Ex parte Armstrong</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 136 CLR 248.</a>  If so, then the judge ought
not to proceed to hear the matter.  Of course, as Gibbs CJ pointed out in
<i>Reg v Simpson: Ex parte Morrison</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%20154%20CLR%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 154 CLR 101</a> at 104, the mere
expression of the apprehension of bias does not establish that it is reasonable
held; that is a matter which must
be determined objectively.
<P>

9   	The principles relating to disqualification on the ground
of reasonable apprehension of bias have also been referred to more
recently in
<i>Vakauta v Kelly </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2063%20ALJR%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 63 ALJR 610</a> and <i>Galea v Galea</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19
NSWLR 263.</a>
<P>

10   	However, in approaching this question of disqualification
on the ground of apprehended bias, it is important to bear in mind
the judgment
of Mason J (as he then was) <i>Re JRL Ex Parte CJL </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 342</a> at
352. His Honour there said:
<P>

It seems that the acceptance by this Court of the test of reasonable
apprehension of bias in such cases as <i>Reg v Watson Ex parte Armstrong
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 136 CLR 248</a> and <i>Livesy v New South Wales Bar Association</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 288</a> has led to an increase in the frequency of applications by
litigants that judicial officers should disqualify themselves from sitting
in
particular cases on account of their participation in other proceedings
involving one of the litigants or an account of conduct
during the litigation.
It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a
reasonable apprehension that
the judicial officer will not decide the case
impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case
adversely
to one part.  There may be many situations in which previous
decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact and law may generate
an
expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely
to one of the parties.  But this does not mean either
that he will approach the
issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in
the sense in which that expression
is used in the authorities or that his
previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a
reasonable apprehension
that he will approach the issues in this way.  In cases
of this kind, disqualification is only made out by showing that there is
reasonable apprehension of bias by reason or prejudgment and this be "firmly
established": <i>Reg v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission Ex
parte Angliss Group</i><b> </b>(1969) 122 CLR 546 at 553 to  554; <i>Reg v
Watson; Ex parte New South Wales Bar Association</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 136 CLR 248</a>; <i>Re
Lusink Ex parte Shaw</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2055%20ALJR%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 55 ALJR 12</a> at 14,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20ALR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">32 ALR 47</a> at 50-51.  Although
it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important
that judicial officers discharge
their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too
readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage  parties to believe
that by
seeking the disqualification  of a judge, they will have their case
tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case
in their
favour.
<P>

11   	One of the most recent authoritative decisions in this
area of the law and one which emphasises and applies the sentiments
expressed
by Mason J in the passage which I have just quoted from in <i>Re JRL Ex Parte
CJL</i>, is the unreported decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Raybos
Australia Pty Limited v Tectran Corporation Pty Limited</i> (No9) (27 November
1990).
<P>

12   	In the leading judgment, Kirby P, by then the President of
the Court of Appeal, referred to applications of this nature and
to an
application which was made to the judge at first instance that he should
disqualify himself and that another judge should hear
the matter. His Honour
said:
<P>

One cannot but have sympathy for his Honour.  It appears that he inherited the
allocation of the proceedings only when another judge,
originally allocated,
took leave to fulfil an overseas commitment.  The inheritance of litigation
with such a long history of interlocutory
challenges and appeals (and with the
prospect of a trial of many months, possibly years ahead) must not have seemed
immediately alluring.
 For many, the slightest legitimate excuse to avoid such
a burden - and to let the cup pass - would have been accepted, perhaps with
solemn disavowals of distress, but with relief nonetheless.
<P>

13   	The President later continued:
<P>

A party may not, by the vehemence of an assertion of grounds for
disqualification, or the angry repetition of such grounds, drive
a judge,
otherwise assigned to hear a case and not disqualified from doing so, from the
fulfilment of his or her duty.
<P>

14   	His Honour later reviewed the various authorities to which
I have already herein referred and pointed out that the relevant
considerations
usually tug at the mind in opposing directions.  His Honour also referred to
series of recent decisions where the
High Court of Australia stressed the very
high standards of manifest neutrality and impartiality established by that
Court for observance
by every judicial officer in the courts of Australia.  His
Honour made references to the various authorities and decisions in the
High
Court to which I have already referred.
<P>

15   	It is appropriate also that I should refer to a more
recent decision in the Court of Appeal, <i>Bainton v Rajski </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR
539.</a>  In that case Mahoney J said at 541: "it is clear that a judge..." A
little later in his judgement his Honour quoted the passages
which I have
already set forth from the decision of Mason J in the High Court of Australia
in <i>Re JRL Ex parte CJL</i>.
<P>

16   	The present application on behalf of the first and second
defendants is opposed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has pointed
to the fact
that the Counsel who appeared last Friday was Counsel who had been in the
matter for some time and that there was stated
then, on behalf of all the
defendants, that there was no objection to the substantive relief being sought
but only to the identification
of the proposed trustee and, further, that the
objection was one which had for the first time been raised on that very day, 9
April.
 It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that today's application is
only a further step in what Counsel described as a history
of filibustering,
and that in these proceedings there was not, and could not be, a reasonable
apprehension of bias.
<P>

17   	I would not personally have any problem in dealing with
this matter, and especially since the only aspect of the matter which
is in
dispute now appears to be the identity of the proposed statutory trustee for
sale of the subject property. However, the question
which I must now decide is
whether it could be reasonably inferred that I would not bring an impartial and
unprejudiced mind to the
resolution of the matter before me.
<P>

18   	The second defendant perceives the professional
relationship which obtained between himself as a solicitor and myself as a
barrister upwards of thirty years ago as ending on less than good terms.  If
that fact be accurate and be substantiated and if that
be the perception of the
second defendant, then in those circumstances I consider it proper that I
should disqualify myself from
the hearing of the matter.
<P>

19   	However, it seems to me that the plaintiff should not be
prejudiced by further delay in this matter. In consideration of the
fact that
the present application was brought after Counsel appearing in the matter on 9
April had expressly stated on behalf of
the present applicant/defendants that
there was no objection by those, or indeed any, of the parties to my hearing
the matter, I
do not see why, if one of the defendants chooses to change his
instructions after a hearing  date has been fixed, the plaintiff should
be
prejudiced by that fact.
<P>

20   	I propose to have enquiries made to see whether the
hearing will be able to proceed tomorrow.  If it cannot proceed tomorrow,
then
I will do everything possible to arrange for it to be heard at the earliest
possible date.
<P>

21   	I will vacate the hearing before myself fixed for
tomorrow. The present application would have been unnecessary if Counsel
for
the defendants had on 9 April 1999, when I stated that I had had a professional
relationship with the second defendant when I
was in practice at the Bar,
informed the Court that there was some objection to my hearing the matter.
Instead of that, the Court
was expressly informed that there was no problem for
the defendants to my hearing the matter.  The present application has been
brought
about solely because of the conduct of the defendants in allowing the
matter to be fixed for hearing before myself, and the plaintiff
has thereby
been caused expense and inconvenience.
<P>

22   	It is only proper in my view that in those circumstances
the applicant/defendants should pay the cost of today's application.
<P>

23   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1)	I order that the hearing specially fixed before me for Thursday, 15  April
be vacated.
<P>

2)	I order that the cost of the plaintiff of today's application be paid by the
first and second defendants.
<P>

 
<P>

3)	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
