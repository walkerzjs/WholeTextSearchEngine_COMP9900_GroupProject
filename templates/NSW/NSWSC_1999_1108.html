<center><b><u>REMARKS ON SENTENCE</u></b></center>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  
<P>

1   	On 18 August 1999 after a lengthy trial the Prisoner was
convicted of having murdered his wife on 25 February 1997.  He now
stands for
sentence.
<P>

2   	Prior to coming to a conclusion as to the sentence to be
imposed, I must come to such conclusions as I can, consistent with
the verdict
of the jury, bearing on the question of sentence.  Before I rely on any such
conclusion adverse to the Prisoner, I must
be satisfied of it beyond reasonable
doubt.  That said, it is not possible to reach some of the views I have formed
to that level
of satisfaction but as these are matters which operate in his
favour.  In respect of these latter matters, I shall indicate that
my findings
are on a more limited basis. 
<P>

3   	It was common ground that on the morning of 25 February
1997 the Prisoner and his wife had taken their children to school shortly
after
9am , done some shopping, and had breakfast together at a restaurant at
Bankstown.  The Prisoner asserted that the two had
then returned to their home
for a limited period.  The deceased's body was found in a Padstow car park
between the front of a parked
car and a fence at about 11.15am that morning.
It was also common ground that the Prisoner's 4-wheel drive motor vehicle had
been
reversed into a car space adjacent to where the body was found in the
preceding three-quarters of an hour or so.  
<P>

4   	No one saw the Prisoner kill the deceased.  Both in the
course of interviews with the police and in evidence, the Prisoner
denied doing
so and thus the circumstances of and reasons for her death can only be matters
of inference.  
<P>

5   	Although it is clear that the deceased had bled and there
was no blood found in the home of the deceased and the Prisoner,
none in his
car and no indication that the latter had been cleaned, the probability is that
the deceased was killed at home and her
body then carried in his car to the
car-park.  Factors pointing in that direction are that, at the time her body
was found the deceased's
shoes were undone - the family practice was not to
wear shoes in the house - the presence of a torn up Valentine's day card and a
picture frame in a rubbish bin at the house, and the fact that a pillow slip
matching one found in the home was covering the deceased's
head at the time she
was found.  There were also tyre marks over the lawn leading to the back
door.
<P>

6   	At the time of the deceased's death, she and her husband
carried on a business of running two take-away food outlets, one principally
managed by the deceased at Circular Quay and one principally managed by the
Prisoner at Blacktown.  I am satisfied that the takings
of the Blacktown
business which were banked in the second six months of 1996 were very
substantially lower than they had been previously.
<P>

7   	There was a deal of detailed evidence as to the financial
situation of the business.  I referred to this evidence in my summing
up and do
not think it necessary to carry out a detailed analysis of it here.  The
evidence satisfies me that, to a substantial degree,
takings were being, as it
were, siphoned off and not banked.  The Prisoner gave explanation for the
reduction in bankings and attributed
this reduction to actions of his wife.
<P>

8   	Sometime after the deceased's death, the Prisoner wrote a
suicide note in which he said "I have gambled my life away and my
fortune" and
it may well be that this is the explanation for the downturn in the bankings
apparent from the Blacktown business. 
He gave evidence and told a psychiatrist
that his gambling only became a problem after his wife's death but, having
regard to my
views as to the Prisoner's credibility, I am not disposed to
accept these statements.  Nor do I accept his evidence that it was his
wife who
was responsible for the those bankings being reduced, certainly to anything
like the magnitude of the money that disappeared.
<P>

9   	I am satisfied that the deceased was concerned at the
financial situation of the Blacktown business.  I am also satisfied that
in the
past and probable in the months leading up to her death, the deceased gave
consideration to the possibility of divorcing the
Prisoner and expressed
thoughts to this effect.
<P>

10   	There is a deal of evidence that, at least to outward
appearance, the relationship between the deceased and the Prisoner was
good and
there is nothing to suggest that his killing of her was to any extent
pre-meditated.  Indeed the limited amount of time
which elapsed between when
they were seen at Bankstown and her body was discovered and the location and
time at which her body was
dumped - a public car park in broad daylight - leads
me to the view that her death was not pre-meditated to any significant extent.
I think the probability is that an argument developed after the Prisoner and
his wife left Bankstown, that the argument commenced
or continued at their home
- the torn Valentine's day card and picture frame so suggest - and it was in
the course of, or in response
to, that argument that the deceased was killed.
I am not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her death occurred
other
than, as submitted by Mr Mulligan, in the course of an argument that got
out of hand.  The deceased's concern at the financial situation
of the
Blacktown business and thoughts of divorce certainly provide possible bases for
an argument.
<P>

11   	On the other hand, the method of death - strangulation -
satisfies me that at the time, the Prisoner intended to kill his
wife.  I am
unable to understand how he might have only intended to do grievous bodily
harm. 
<P>

12   	In arriving at the conclusions I have, I am not
unconscious of the fact that the Prisoner's actions in and about disposing
of
his wife's body reveal a deal of care and that his actions in, for example,
telephoning her place of work purportedly with the
intention of speaking to her
demonstrate a degree of conscious cunning.  However, even though many and
perhaps most people would
not have reacted that way, those matters are
explicable upon the basis of a desire to avoid the consequences of what had
occurred.
<P>

13   	Under the New South Wales Crimes Act the maximum penalty
for murder is life imprisonment.  However, the law is that that penalty
is to
be imposed only in cases which may be regarded as falling within "a worst type"
of murder.  Examples of that are premeditated
contract killings, second or
later offences, or where torture or great humiliation or pain has been
inflicted on the victim.  Those
examples are not intended to be exhaustive.
The circumstances I have outlined clearly do not come within a worst category.
I was
taken by the Crown Prosecutor to a number of prior decisions of the Court
which lead to the conclusion that the usual range of sentences
in the cases of
a murder of a woman by a man, occurring in circumstances of a continuing or
recently terminated relationship between
them, reveals total sentences ranging
from about 16 to about 22 years with minimum terms ranging from about 11 to 16
years.  
<P>

14   	I turn to the subjective circumstances of the Prisoner.
He was born on 7 January 1958 in Hong Kong where he attended school
until about
the equivalent of year 9.  He completed his schooling in year 12 at a Sydney
High School.  He joined a bank in early
1976 becoming a senior loans officer in
1987.  He took some long leave in 1991 at which time he and his wife took over
the running
of one of the take-away businesses which was later acquired.  He
resigned from the bank in 1992 or 1993 and from that time onwards,
his
employment has been in running one or other of the take-away food businesses he
and his wife, or their private company, has run.
<P>

15   	He has two children, a daughter born in March 1987 and a
son born in June 1991.  There is one matter on his record which is
of no
significance for present purposes.
<P>

16   	There was also tendered by the Crown a victim impact
statement by Jean Mei, the sister of the deceased.  I have read that
statement
but the use to which I can put it has been defined in <b>R v Previtera</b>
(unreported, HUNT CJ AT CL, 27 May 1997) 
<P>

17   	On the Prisoner's behalf was tendered a psychiatric report
from Dr Canaris.  I find little in that report of assistance. 
The only
significant aspect is its reference to the Prisoner's depression, evidenced
also by his suicide note.  These are matters
to which the Jail Authorities
should have regard.  Any tendency towards depression I am sure will be
exacerbated by the realisation
that he will be separated from his children from
much of their growing up years.
<P>

18   	Evidence was also given by a person who had previously
been the Prisoner's superior at the bank at which he worked, who indicated
that
the Prisoner was a very valuable and efficient employee.
<P>

19   	There is nothing in the circumstances of this case to
indicate any likelihood that the Prisoner will offend again.  Although
the
intent to kill which I have found argues against this conclusion, the lack of
pre-meditation and the absence of any suggestion
of violence in his past argue
in favour of a sentence which is towards the lower end of the range to which I
have referred.
<P>

20   	The sentence I impose is one of minimum term of 14 years
penal servitude with an additional term of 4 years.  The commencing
date of the
minimum term will be 28 July 1999, a date which reflects the date of 18 August
1999 when the Prisoner went into custody
after the jury's verdict and 3 weeks
custody subsequent to his arrest.  He will become eligible for parole on 28
July 2013.
