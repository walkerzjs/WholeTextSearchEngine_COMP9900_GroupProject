TUESDAY 21 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>2920/95 - JIWIRA PTY LIMITED &amp; 1 OR  v  PRIMARY INDUSTRY BANK OF
AUSTRALIA (`PIBA') </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered ex tempore on 21 September 1999, and revised on 23
September 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This matter has been set down for a 15 day hearing
before me beginning on 9 November 1999.  By a Notice of Motion
filed on 11
August 1999 the plaintiff sought leave to file an amended Statement of Claim
referred to in the materials as the `Second
Further Amended Statement of
Claim'.  I shall it `the New Pleading'.  The application was heard by me
today.
<P>

2  	The explanation for the need to file a further pleading, such as
it is, is contained in the affidavit of Mary Cunningham, a
solicitor, who has
the conduct of the proceedings on behalf of the plaintiffs' solicitor on the
record, dated 10 August 1999.  She
explains that the original Statement of
Claim was prepared by counsel who is no longer retained and there now is
litigation between
that counsel and the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs have
retained new counsel for the amended pleading following advice that the
existing
Further Amended Statement of Claim (`the Existing Pleading') is not
satisfactory, in that it is poorly drafted and all the elements
of the
plaintiffs' claim are not clear.  Ms Cunningham states that it has taken the
plaintiff a substantial amount of time to obtain
full discovery, and she makes
contested assertions about the provision of information by the defendant.
<P>

3  	According to the plaintiffs, the Existing Pleading is
misconceived and mistaken and the problem needs to be cured before the
hearing
takes place.  The plaintiffs' submission to me on this application puts the
matter starkly, claiming the Existing Pleading
is `inadequate to the point of
being an embarrassing pleading'.
<P>

4  	When the Court is confronted with an application of this kind,
the general approach which it should take is reasonably clear.
 It is described
in the well-known statement of Bowen LJ in<b> </b><i>Cropper v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%2026%20ChD%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884)
26 ChD 700</a> at 710, considered and applied by the High Court in<b> </b><i>Clough
v Frog</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%204%20ALR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 4 ALR 615:</a>
<P>

`It is a well-established principle that the object of courts is to decide the
rights of the parties and not to punish them for
mistakes they make in the
conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise that in accordance with the
rights. ... I know of no kind
of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or
intended to overreach, the court ought not to correct, if it can be done
without
injustice to the other party.  Courts do not exist for the sake of
discipline, but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy.
... as soon as
it appears that the way in which a party has framed his case will not lead to a
decision of the real matter in controversy,
it is as much a matter of right on
his part to have it corrected, if it can be done without injustice, as anything
else in the case
is a matter of right.'
<P>

5  	The matter is put even more clearly by Bramwell LJ in
<i>Tildesley v Harper</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%2010%20ChD%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 10 ChD 393</a> at 398:
<P>

`My practice has always been to give leave to amend unless I have been
satisfied that the party applying was acting mala fide, or
that, by his
blunder, he has done some injury to his opponent which could not be compensated
for by costs or otherwise.'
<P>

6  	In this Court the power to grant leave to a party to amend a
pleading is dealt with in Pt 20 of the Supreme Court Rules.  The
Court's
general power expressed in very broad terms is in r 1.  Rule 4 deals with a
case where a relevant period of limitation expires
after the date of filing a
Statement of Claim and, thereafter, an application is made under r 1 for leave
to amend the Statement
of Claim. The rule applies in three specific
circumstances, set out in sub-rules (3), (4) and (5), though there is an issue
as to
whether r 1 confers a discretion to add a new cause of action after the
expiry of a limitation period outside the specific cases
mentioned in r 4:
<i>Ritchie's Supreme Court Practice</i> (looseleaf) par 20.4.7.
<P>

7  	For reasons which I shall explain, the defendant says that the
amendment will have the effect of overcoming what would otherwise
be a
statute-barred claim and so r 4 is applicable.  The relevant sub-rule of r 4 in
the present circumstances is sub-r 4(5), which
is in the following terms:
<P>

`Where a plaintiff, in his statement of claim, makes a claim for relief on a
cause of action arising out of any facts, the Court
may order that he have
leave to make an amendment having the effect of adding or substituting a new
cause of action arising out of
the same or substantially the same facts and a
claim for relief on that new cause of action.'
<P>

8  	At today's hearing counsel for the defendant informed me that its
opposition to the application for leave to amend is now confined
to two
matters, both relating to new allegations of abuse of process in the New
Pleading.  I shall deal with them in turn.
<P>

<b>Abuse of process in relation to the winding up proceedings</b>
<P>

9  	This matter is dealt with in paragraphs 38 - 43 of the New
Pleading.  Broadly speaking, the New Pleading alleges that the defendant
commenced winding up proceedings in this Court at a time when it possessed
security and was aware that the property over which it
held security was to be
sold at an auction.  The allegation is that there was no proper commercial
purpose to be served by seeking
the first plaintiff's winding up and
consequently the winding up proceedings were an abuse of process commenced and
maintained to
effect an object not within the scope of the process and causing
the plaintiff damages.  Particulars are given.  
<P>

10  	The winding up proceedings are referred to in the Existing
Pleading.  Paragraph 89 asserts that the defendant and others `acted
negligently with conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of the first
plaintiff's rights'.  Particulars of that pleading include
the assertion that
the defendant put the first plaintiff into liquidation on 17 December 1992,
just four days before the defendant
sold the Jiwira land and exercised a put
option for the DLM land.  The particulars also refer to the security which the
defendant
held.
<P>

11  	Additionally, par 128 of the Existing Pleading asserts that `the
defendant and others acted unlawfully, negligently, unconscionably
with
conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard for the second plaintiff's
rights.'  The particulars which are given assert that
`part of the defendant's
conduct and strategy' was to place the first plaintiff in liquidation on 17
December 1992 when the sale
of property had been arranged to take place four
days subsequently, and to keep the first plaintiff in liquidation.  
<P>

12  	Further, par 149 of the Existing Pleading asserts that the
defendant and others deliberately charged the first plaintiff certain
costs and
kept the first plaintiff in liquidation, and particulars of the costs are
given.
<P>

13  	As the defendant points out, the acts complained of in these
paragraphs occurred between November 1992, when the defendant
commenced winding
up proceedings, and 17 December  1992, when the company was wound up.  Abuse of
process is a tort and is subject
to the six year limitation period contained in
s 14 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> (NSW).  Consequently, unless the Court
exercises its power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 20</a> to grant an amendment after the expiry of the
limitation period, the pleading of the cause of action may be
statute-barred.
<P>

<b>Abuse of process in relation to bankruptcy proceedings</b>
<P>

14  	This is dealt with in pars 44 - 46 of the New Pleading. Those
paragraphs assert that on about 21 January 1993 the defendant
filed a
creditors' petition in bankruptcy proceedings against the second plaintiff.  It
is alleged that the defendant relied on an
affidavit of Beverley Hugh Waters of
19 January 1993 to support that application.  The pleading asserts that the
bankruptcy proceedings
were an abuse of process commenced and maintained to
effect an object not within the scope of the process and that the plaintiff
thereby suffered damage.
<P>

15  	Once again there are some matters in the Existing Pleading which
are relevant.  I have referred to paragraphs 89 and 128. 
The particulars to
those paragraphs each refer to the issuing of the creditors' petition in much
the same way as they refer to the
winding up proceedings.
<P>

16  	Additionally, pars 151, 152 and 153 of the Existing Pleading
refer to a number of matters including the affidavit by Ms Waters,
and allege
that the affidavit is misleading, deceptive, unconscionable, false or
negligent' and in breach of the Trade Practices
Act and Fair Trading Act.
<P>

17  	The bankruptcy proceedings were commenced on 21 January 1993
and, consequently, any action in tort for an abuse of process
is potentially
statute-barred, just as in the case of the action for abuse of process in the
winding up proceedings.
<P>

<b>The defendant's contentions</b>
<P>

18  	The defendant's first contention is that Pt 20 r 4 is
inapplicable in the circumstances set out above and, consequently, that
the
Court should follow the rule of practice enunciated in<b> </b><i>Weldon v
Neal</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2019%20QBD%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 19 QBD 394</a>, which would mean that the amendment would be
refused because it would set up a cause of action which is statute-barred at
the time
of the amendment.  The rule of practice has been reversed by Pt 20 r 4
(<i>McGee v Yeomans </i>[19977]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 NSWLR 273)</a>, but the defendant says that since
Pt 20 r 4 does not apply in the present case the rule of practice should be
applied.
<P>

19  	As an alternative submission the defendant says that if the
Court decides to exercise its power under Pt 20 r 4(5) an order
should be made
under sub-r 4(5A) so that the amendment takes effect only from the date upon
which it is made and does not relate
back to the filing of the Statement of
Claim, with the result that the statute bar remains applicable.
<P>

20  	Secondly, the defendant submits that no adequate reason has been
advanced to persuade the Court in the exercise of its discretion
to allow the
application to be made at this very late stage.  
<P>

21  	I shall deal with the application of Pt 20 r 4(5) and with the
question of discretion sequentially.  There is another claim
which relates to
the adequacy of the New Pleading, to which I shall then turn.  
<P>

<b>The applicability of Pt 20 r 4(5)</b>
<P>

22  	The defendant makes two submissions.  First, the defendant says
that in the Existing Pleading the plaintiff has not made any
`claim for relief
on a cause of action arising out of any facts'.  The defendant submits that the
winding up and bankruptcy proceedings
have not been pleaded as facts which are
part of any recognised cause of action.  The facts relating to the winding up
and bankruptcy
are principally contained in particulars scattered throughout
the pleading in a disjointed fashion, leaving no finding of conclusion
or
recognisable cause of action.  Secondly, the defendant submits that an
amendment adding new causes of action for abuse of process
in respect of the
winding up and bankruptcy proceedings cannot be described as `adding or
substituting a new cause of action arising
out of the same or substantially the
same facts'.
<P>

23  	As to the first of those contentions, while I have considerable
sympathy with the defendant's frustration with respect to the
Existing
Pleading, it seems to me there is just enough in the Existing Pleading to
attract the words of sub-r 4(5).
<P>

24  	There is, in the paragraphs to which I have referred, an
assertion of a cause of action which might broadly be described as
a cause of
action in negligence arising out of facts concerning the winding up and
bankruptcy pleadings.  The pleader has mixed up
the ingredients of the cause of
action, and ingredients which go to the assessment of damages on some exemplary
or aggravated basis.
 The whole pleading is most unsatisfactory.  However, when
read literally, the paragraphs to which I have referred identify a cause
of
action, however misconceived it might be, and however little support the
pleaded facts might give to the cause of action which
there arises.
<P>

25  	As to the second submission, the defendant has handed up a very
useful comparison between the Existing Pleading and the New
Pleading from which
it appears that the New Pleading is in many respects more fulsome and certainly
more specific and clearer than
the Existing Pleading.
<P>

26  	There is a question of judgment to be dealt with in applying the
words of sub-r 4(5) `arising out of the same or substantially
the same facts'.
It is clear that the pleaded facts in the Existing and New Pleadings need not
be identical.  It seems to me that
the words of the sub-rule need to be
interpreted having regard to their purpose, which is to ensure that undue
prejudice does not
flow to a party who is affected by the amendment to the
pleading.
<P>

27  	Applying the sub-rule in that way, although I acknowledge there
are some important differences demonstrated by the schedule
produced by the
defendant, it seems to me this is a case where the Court can conclude that in
the confused and unsatisfactory Existing
Pleading there is a pleading of facts
which are substantially the same facts as are relied upon in the New Pleading
to support the
new cause of action for abuse of process.
<P>

<b>The Court's discretion</b>
<P>

28  	That being so, the question is whether the Court should, in the
exercise of its discretion, allow the amendment to be made
at this late stage
in the proceedings.  It appears that no new substantial evidence will be needed
to support the New Pleading and
as I have said it relies upon substantially the
same facts as have earlier been pleaded.  It is sensibly suggested by the
defendant,
and happily the plaintiffs agree, that if the abuse of process
amendments are granted this should be on terms that the defendant
have leave to
bring an application to seek to strike them out if, having been served with
some further affidavit evidence which the
plaintiff seeks to provide, the
defendant can then demonstrate prejudice in meeting the abuse of process
claims.
<P>

29  	I propose to make my orders in those terms.  That being so, my
opinion is that undue prejudice to the defendant has not been
shown and it is
appropriate, in the exercise of my discretion, to allow the amendment to be
made.
<P>

<b>Adequacy of the New Pleading</b>
<P>

30  	The defendant also submits that the New Pleading with respect to
abuse of process is deficient in a vital element. It contends
that the New
Pleading fails to allege that the purpose of intimidating or frightening the
first plaintiff from investigating and
challenging the activities of the
contest was achieved.
<P>

31  	This challenge to the New Pleading should not be allowed to
succeed on the present motion.  The ingredients of the tort of
abuse of process
are at this stage not completely settled.  In<b> </b><i>Hanrahan v
Ainsworth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20NSWLR%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 22 NSWLR 73</a> at 112 Clarke JA said that an action on the
case for abuse of the process of the court lies where it has been proved that
process
ancillary to a principal claim for relief has been used to effect an
object not within the scope of the process, and damage has resulted.
That
formulation does not require, as an ingredient of the tort, proof that the
abusive purpose has been effected.
<P>

32  	The matter was also referred to by Gleeson CJ in<b>
</b><i>Ballina Shire Council v Ringland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 680</a> especially at
695-6.  His Honour said that this matter is a subject upon which there are
conflicting opinions, and the law cannot
be said to have been settled.  He
remarked that there is authority which supports the view that in order to make
out a claim of the
kind presently in question, it would not be enough for the
claimant to show that the respondent had an improper subjective purpose
at the
time that it initiated proceedings; on this view of the law it would also be
necessary for the claimant to show something
of the nature of an overt act,
that is to say, some actual use of the proceedings for the improper use
alleged.  Gleeson CJ then
remarked that where the alleged improper purpose is
intimidation, the distinction is a fine one and that if the alleged improper
purpose is to frighten someone into inactivity, and it can be shown to have
that effect, it must be at least arguable that the requirements
for
establishing an abuse of process for an improper purpose have been
satisfied.
<P>

33  	It seems to me unnecessary to resolve this issue in an
application of the present kind.  There is sufficient support for the
view of
the ingredients of the tort of abuse of process reflected in the New Pleading
as presently drafted that I should allow the
amendment to proceed in that form.
Clearly this is a matter which the present counsel for the plaintiffs has
carefully considered
and if at the hearing I am persuaded that the pleading is
deficient, it is possible that consequences may follow at that stage.
<P>

<b>Other matters</b>
<P>

34  	The plaintiffs, as I have indicated, wish to put on some
additional evidence and the parties agree that it would be proper
to require
that the additional evidence be filed within seven days.  I shall give a
direction accordingly. The defendant should be
allowed a further 28 days to put
on its evidence in response.  At that stage no further evidence should be
filed. If the defendant
can, having seen the plaintiff's further evidence,
point to some specific prejudice with respect to the abuse of process
amendments,
it will have leave to make an application accordingly.  The
defendant has sought particulars of the New Pleading and they should
be
provided within 14 days.  I propose to make a direction accordingly.
<P>

35  	Finally, on the question of costs, the plaintiffs concede that
it is appropriate for an order to be made against them for payment
of the
defendant's costs thrown away by virtue of the amendment which I will grant
leave to file, and that the plaintiffs should
be ordered pay the defendant's
costs of the present Notice of Motion.  At one stage the defendant sought an
order that the plaintiffs
pay those costs forthwith upon assessment, but that
matter was not pressed.  My own view is that the abandonment of that claim was
appropriate given that the hearing is now very close.
<P>

36  	The defendant also sought an order that the plaintiffs provide
security with respect to the costs order which I am about to
make, on the
ground that the application for amendment has been made late.  The defendant
has had to incur costs which, it says,
it should not be required to bear at
this stage. The defendant points out this is the second application to amend
which has been
made and a costs order was made on the earlier occasion.  A
further costs order would be cold comfort to the defendant if nothing
is left
to cover payment of its costs should it be successful at the hearing.  
<P>

37  	This is not sufficient to justify an order for provision of
security and I do not, therefore, propose to make such an order.
 But my
decision not to do so should not be taken to prevent the defendant from making
an application for security for costs on proper
grounds in respect of the costs
order which I shall make today on any proper basis.
<P>

38  	My orders are as follows:
<P>

(1)	I grant leave to the plaintiffs to file an amended Statement of Claim in
the form of the Second Further Amended Statement of
Claim being Annexure A to
the affidavit of Mary Cunningham of 10 August 1999.
<P>

(2)	I grant leave to the defendant to make an application by Notice of Motion
seeking to strike out all or any of paragraphs 38
- 46 of the Second Further
Amended Statement of Claim on grounds relating to specific prejudice, if that
application is filed on
or before Tuesday 12 October 1999. (3)  I direct that
any further affidavit evidence for the plaintiffs be filed and served on or
before Tuesday 28 September 1999.
<P>

(4)	I direct that any further affidavit evidence in reply to further evidence
of the plaintiffs be filed and served on or  before
Tuesday 19 October 1999.
<P>

(5)	I direct that the plaintiffs answer the defendant's request for particulars
of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim
contained in a letter dated 14
September 1999 on or before Tuesday 5 October 1999.
<P>

(6)	I order that the plaintiffs pay the defendant's costs thrown away by the
amendment constituted by the Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim and the
defendant's costs with respect to the present Notice of Motion.
<P>

(7)	I make the orders in the pre-trial directions which I initial and date for
the purposes of identification.
