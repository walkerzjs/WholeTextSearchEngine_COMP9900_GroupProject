Defendant
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>22 June 1999</b>
<P>

1   	The Defendant in the principal proceedings applies by the
relevant cross-vesting provision contained in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations (New South
Wales) Act</i> 1990</a> for their transfer to the Supreme Court of Western
Australia. This is to be found principally in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss40</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">42</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">44</a> facilitated by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s44c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss44C</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s44d.html" class="autolink_findacts">44D</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">48</a>. Relevantly, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s44(2)</a> provides as follows:
<P>

"<b>44. (2)</b>  Where it appears to the court that, having regard to the
interests of justice, it is more appropriate for the proceeding, or an
application in the proceeding, to be determined by another court having
jurisdiction in the matters for determination in the proceeding
or application,
the first-mentioned court may transfer the proceeding or application to that
other court."
<P>

2   	The principal proceedings are applications for an
injunction brought by the Plaintiff as a minority shareholder in the Defendant.
The injunction seeks to restrain the proposal of two resolutions at an
extraordinary general meeting of the Defendant, a listed exploration
company
incorporated in Western Australia and having its principal place of business
there, where also are its assets and projects.
The relevant resolutions are
thus to be passed at a meeting in Western Australia. They relate first to the
approval of a reduction
of capital to be satisfied by an in specie transfer of
shares in another company ("the second resolution"). Second, they relate to
the
approval of a transaction involving the acquisition from a non-Australian
company of shares in an Australian company, the consideration
for which
consisting of the allotment of shares in the Defendant company to the
non-Australian company, all this being pursuant to
a call option in favour of
the Defendant. I refer to this transaction and the resolution compendiously as
"the third resolution".
<P>

3   	The attack by the Plaintiff on the second resolution is a
purely legal point where it is not anticipated that any witnesses
would be
required.
<P>

4   	The attack by the Plaintiff on the third resolution is
however based upon the contention that the relevant material provided
to
shareholders is either misleading or deceptive or otherwise contravenes s995 of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. While the nature of the Plaintiff's case has yet
to be clarified, it would appear from the annexed correspondence to Mr Ryan's
affidavit
of 19 June 1999 that it will include the contention that the
Defendant has not sufficiently identified the relationship between the
Defendant and the non-Australian company. That matter and other related
questions have led the Defendant to conclude that it seems
likely that the
state of knowledge of the Defendant and its directors will be in issue and
accordingly the Defendant proposes to
have two of its Western Australian
resident directors give evidence regarding those matters.
<P>

5   	The Plaintiff for its part contends that in relation to the
third resolution it would simply rely on NSW experts and complains
that the
Defendant is not doing likewise. The Defendant's forensic choice is probably to
rely on the evidence of two of its resident
directors. I should observe that I
have no reason to doubt the bona fides of the Defendant's likely forensic
choice. Nor, looking
at the Plaintiff's position, is it by any means
self-evident that the Plaintiff would be prejudiced if it decided to rely on
Western
Australian legal advisers or arranged for its local lawyers to conduct
the proceedings in Western Australia and obtained any experts
from there. That
however is again a matter for the Plaintiff's forensic choice and it suffices
to say that there is nothing inevitable,
contrary to the Plaintiff's
submission, that these proceedings necessarily require only experts to give
evidence rather than from
those directly involved, who reside in Western
Australia.
<P>

6   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cswa1990344/s44b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 44B</a> requires that a court must have regard to where
the principal place of business of the body corporate concerned in the
proceeding
is located and the place or places where the relevant events that
are the subject of the proceeding or application took place. It
will be
apparent that the Defendant has its principal place of business in Western
Australia while the Plaintiff has its principal
place of business in New South
Wales. However, the places where the relevant events have occurred or are to
occur are clearly enough
Western Australia.
<P>

7   	The criteria to be applied in determining whether orders
for cross-vesting should be made are set out in <i>Bankinvest AG v Seabrook
&amp; Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 711</a> particularly at 727, 728 and 730 in the
judgment of Rogers AJA. The "interests of justice" look not so much to
convenience but to
the suitability or appropriateness of the relevant
jurisdiction. This is to identify the natural forum whose appropriateness
depends
on finding whether it has the most real and substantial connection with
the action in question. Here, almost self-evidently, as indeed
I indicated when
the matter first came before me, that place is Western Australia. Nothing I
have heard from the Respondent to this
application indicates otherwise. That
the recipient of the consideration to be issued under the third resolution is a
non-Australian
company which is to sell shares in another company certainly
does not represent a real and substantial connection with New South
Wales.
While there may be questions of convenience form the point of view of the
Plaintiff as a New South Wales company with a New
South Wales legal adviser,
that, as I have said, could not prevail over those matters of real and
substantial connection.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION AND ORDERS</b>
<P>

8   	I conclude that the Defendant's application should be
granted. Accordingly I order that the proceedings in No. 2813 of 1999
be
transferred to the Supreme Court of Western Australia, it having jurisdiction
in the relevant matters. Costs of the Defendant's
motion and of the hearing on
18 June 1999 shall be paid by the Plaintiff. The matter comes close to
justifying indemnity costs, given
the strong indications I gave at the hearing
on 18 June 1999.
