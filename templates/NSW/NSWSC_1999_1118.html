<b>  Voyager/Melbourne collision)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 26
October 1998 seeks an extension of time within which to commence proceedings
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 (NSW) (the Act).
The plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 22 March 1999.  The defendant
relied on the affidavit of Con Ktenas
affirmed on 12 November 1999. The
defendant opposes the orders sought.  
<P>

2  	I observed the plaintiff carefully when he gave evidence and was
cross-examined.  I formed the opinion that he was giving truthful
evidence and
I accept it.
<P>

3  	For the purposes of this application I find the following
facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 13 November 1945 and is 54 years of age.  He
resides in the State of Victoria.
<P>

(2)	On 7 January 1962 the plaintiff became a member of the Royal Australian
Navy as a recruit.  He was then aged 16 years.  He enlisted
for an initial
period of 12 years and looked forward to making the Navy his career for the
next 30 years.  
<P>

(3)	On 10 February 1964 at approximately 2056 hours Eastern Standard time a
collision occurred between the aircraft carrier HMAS
Melbourne and the
destroyer Voyager at sea about 20 miles south east of Jervis Bay.  Eighty two
men from the Voyager lost their lives
in the collision.  Five of the
plaintiff's friends died as a result of the collision.  Two of those were his
closest friends.  Of
the fourteen recruits he had entered the Navy with he was
the only survivor.
<P>

(4)	At the time of the collision the plaintiff was standing outside of 3 Delta
Starboard Mess.  He felt a thump and ran to the side
of the ship.  The
plaintiff saw the stern of the Voyager off the starboard side of the Melbourne.
He heard a call to emergency stations
and was ordered to the hangar to assist
in laying out the stretchers for the injured survivors.  He was ordered to take
an audit
of survivors including their names and addresses, ranks and serial
numbers.  He went from one survivor to the next taking their particulars.
 He
saw some men in a state of panic, some with terrible injuries and in complete
fear and shock and covered in oil.  He continued
taking the particulars of the
survivors until the early hours of the morning.  All of the time he was looking
for his friends.  As
the morning wore on he became more and more distressed and
anxious as he had not been able to find them.  He realised that his best
friends were dead and he broke down and cried.  
<P>

(5)	On arriving back in Sydney the plaintiff was given shore leave.  He went to
a hotel and got drunk.  He had not drunk alcohol
prior to the collision.
During his stay in Sydney he was the subject of abuse and insults by the
general public and on one occasion
he was spat at.  In February 1964 when the
plaintiff was at the bar of a hotel in Sydney he just exploded and threw chairs
and tables
around the room and the police were called.  Ever since the
collision he has drunk heavily in order to try to sleep and forget the
memories
of the night of the collision.  He took up drinking and smoking to try to calm
his nerves.  He became edgy and anxious and
was argumentative with his friends
and with his workmates.
<P>

(6)	In about April 1964 the plaintiff began to gamble.  He would place bets
with an SP bookie who was on board the ship.  He became
a compulsive gambler
and this continues to the present day.  
<P>

(7)	The plaintiff served on the Melbourne up until 13 December 1964.  From 14
December 1964 until 25 August 1965 he was posted to
HMAS Cerberus which is a
shore base.  On 26 August 1965 until 15 December 1968 the plaintiff served at
HMAS Lonsdale.  This also
was a shore posting.  At HMAS Lonsdale he had a high
pressure job processing 230 officers' pay and leave entitlements.  For some
months he worked from 8.00 am to 2 or 3 o'clock the next morning.
<P>

(8)	On 16 December 1968 the plaintiff was posted to HMAS Sydney and as soon as
he was informed that this would be a sea posting
he became anxious and fearful.
He dreaded the thought of the sea posting.  He did however for a period attempt
to carry on with his
duties whilst on the HMAS Sydney but became more irritable
and nervy, and his behaviour was causing difficulty with his friends around
him.  He felt depressed, became aggressive and argumentative.  He was
insubordinate and his confidence in the Navy had plummeted
even further.  He
was sent to see several doctors but was not aware that they were psychiatrist.
He was sent to hospital at HMAS
Penguin.  As a consequence of his behaviour he
was posted to HMAS Kimbla.  
<P>

(9)	In April or May 1970 the plaintiff was sent to the HMAS Cerberus.  He
recalls that he was anxious and depressed.  He was a leading
writer and refused
to carry out his duties.  He had to undergo medical examinations but was not
told what was wrong with him.  The
plaintiff knew that he felt depressed and
unable to cope with his work but did not know why.  He did not think that he
had a psychiatric
illness.  
<P>

(10)	On 11 March 1971 the plaintiff was honourably discharged from the Navy.
He had attained the rank of Leading Writer.
<P>

(11)	The outpatient records of the Navy show that in 1970 the plaintiff was
diagnosed as suffering from an anxiety state and was
placed on medication.  He
was treated by Mr N Issakidis a psychologist and Dr John McGeorge a
psychiatrist who has since died, and
Dr W S Reynolds a consultant psychiatrist
on a number of occasions.  The plaintiff says that he had not seen a copy of
these psychological
records until he swore his affidavit.  He had not seen any
of his service records, including his service medical records, until March
or
April of 1998.  When he first read these records he was shocked by some of the
details, particularly those relating to his psychiatric
state.  None of the
psychiatric details contained in the medical records have ever been related to
the plaintiff.  He had no idea
of the contents of his medical file.  He was
never told that he suffered a psychiatric disorder.  He said that the Navy had
kept
him completely and utterly in the dark as to his psychiatric health prior
to his discharge.  He knew that he had been put on tablets
when he was at HMAS
Penguin but was never told what his condition was or why he had to see the
doctors.  He thought that he suffered
from nervous tension due to work.
<P>

(11)	Since the plaintiff's discharge from the Navy he has had 27 different
jobs.  He was unemployed from October 1998 until October
1999.  He is currently
working for the Grey Army.  
<P>

(13)	In about August 1997 the plaintiff read an article in a newspaper
concerning the collision and broke down.  Although his wife
suggested he see a
doctor he saw a solicitor, Mr David Foster in Melbourne.  Later in 1997 he
consulted his current solicitor.
<P>

(14)	In November 1997 the plaintiff saw Dr Knox.  At the conclusion of the
interview Dr Knox informed the plaintiff that he was
suffering from Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and told the plaintiff that his problem with
alcoholism was a consequence of
his stress disorder.  The plaintiff did not
know until Dr Knox explained to him that he was suffering from a psychiatric
illness
or disability.  
<P>

(15)	After being examined by Dr Knox the plaintiff had some understanding of
the  effects that the collision had had on his life.
 He says that he has mood
swings, cannot sleep without the lights on, cannot sleep in his own house by
himself as he feels unsafe
and frightened, is unable to socialise properly,
avoids anything which will remind him of the collision, has nightmares and
panic
attacks, he has lost confidence and self-esteem and is a compulsive
gambler.  He is fearful when swimming, going on planes and going
aboard ships.
He has difficulty undergoing psychiatric treatment.  On two occasions namely,
in October 1998 and February 1999 he
broke down and cried during the
consultation and walked out.  
<P>

(16)	Until the plaintiff read the statement of claim in 1998 he had no
knowledge of any acts of negligence of the defendant, and
he did not know that
the acts of negligence caused his psychiatric damage.
<P>

(17)	On 14 October 1998 the statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(18)	On 26 October 1998 the notice of motion seeking as extension of the
limitation period was filed.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

4  	Section 60G empowers the court to extend the limitation period,
if it is just and reasonable to do so, "for such period as it
determines".
<P>

5  	The relevant provisions of s 60I are as follows:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under s 60G or 60H unless it is satisfied
that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

6  	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of s 60G, the
plaintiff must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at 10 February 1970 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period)
he was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in s 60I(1)(a)(i), (ii)
or (iii);
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in s 60I(1)(a) (or the last of those matters
to become known to him)
earlier than 26 October 1995.
<P>

<u>7  	</u>The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to
identify specifically what fact or facts he claims not to have known as at 10
February 1970, which lack of knowledge meets the description in one or more of
paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of s 60I(1)(a);  and
to show (by evidence) the
date on which he acquired knowledge thereof (being a date later than 26 October
1995);  or to show that
that fact was or those facts were still unknown to him
on that date.  The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff ought to have
become aware of the matters listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date -
see s 60I (1)(b).
<P>

8  	The plaintiff relies on s 60I (1)(a)(i), (ii) and (iii).  The
plaintiff submitted that he was unaware that he suffered the psychiatric
condition of PTSD until November 1997 and did not know of the connection
between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omissions
until he read
the statement of claim in 1998.  The defendant did not make any submissions in
relation to s 60I.
<P>

<b>(i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that "he did not know that a
personal injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

9  	Prior to the expiration of the limitation period the plaintiff
knew that he suffered from a nervous disorder due to work.  He
knew that he was
anxious, depressed, aggressive and unable to cope with work.  His level of
confident had plummeted.  He drank alcohol
to excess and took up gambling.  He
did not know that he suffered from a psychiatric illness.
<P>

10  	After leaving the Navy until 1997 the plaintiff had never sought
medical advice in relation to his psychiatric state.  As was
stated by the Full
Federal Court in <b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56
FCR 389</a> (per Gummow and Cooper JJ at p 402) it is important to appreciate that
the personal injury that the plaintiff suffered was a psychiatric
illness.  In
November 1997 the plaintiff was told by a psychiatrist, Dr Knox that he
suffered from PTSD and this was caused by the
collision.  I accept that the
plaintiff was not aware that he suffered a personal injury until November 1997.
The plaintiff has passed
through the s 60I(1)(a)(i) gateway.
<P>

<b>(ii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of the nature
or extent of the personal injury suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

11  	The test of knowledge posed by s 60I (1)(a)(ii) requires the
court to look at the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither
the
reasonableness of that awareness nor constructive knowledge is an element of s
60I (1)(a) - (<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186
CLR 1</a> at pp 9 and 10).  <b><u>Harris</u></b> is a case of a disease of gradual
onset.
<P>

12  	The nature or extent of the injury which the plaintiff has
sustained is to be determined as an objective fact as at the date
of the
hearing of the application.  A plaintiff may be held to have been aware of the
nature or extent of his injury within the relevant
period if during that period
he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having upon him and of its
likely future course,
even though he may have been unaware of the precise
pathology or medical diagnosis.  In particular if the applicant was aware that
the injury would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the
injury for the purpose of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) even though the
injury developed
particular consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee.  As long
as the consequences are of a kind
that an applicant expects, the applicant will
be aware of the extent of the injury (<b><u>Harris</u></b> pp 13 and 14).  I
have referred to the state of the plaintiff's knowledge prior to the expiration
of the limitation period under
the heading s 60I(1)(a)(i).
<P>

13  	For the reasons given under s 60I(1)(a)(i) it is my view that
the plaintiff did not know the nature or extent of his personal
injury until
November 1997 when he knew that he had a diagnosable psychiatric illness.  This
falls within the period stipulated by
s 60I(1)(b).  It is my view that the
plaintiff has passed through the 60I(1)(a)(ii) gateway.  
<P>

<b>(iii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff was "unaware of the connection between
personal injury and the defendant's act or omission</u>"</b>
<P>

14  	Section 60I(1)(a)(iii) is concerned with ignorance of the
existence of acts and omissions rather than legal conclusions.
<P>

15  	The plaintiff submitted that it was not until he read the
statement of claim in 1998 and specifically the particulars of negligence
that
he was aware of the factors that contributed to the collision and that those
factors represented acts of negligence by the defendant
its servants or
agents.
<P>

16  	The acts or omissions referred to in s 60I(1)(a)(iii) are the
acts or omissions on which the plaintiff relied to found the
cause of action
referred to in s 60G.  Those acts or omissions, will be found in the
plaintiff's particulars of negligence. - <b><u>Drayton Coal Board Pty Limited v
Drain</u></b> NSWCA, Gleeson CJ, unreported 22 August 1995).
<P>

17  	In paragraph 5(a) of the statement of claim the plaintiff gives
particulars of negligence as against the officers of the Voyager.
 They are as
follows:
<P>

<b>(a)	Causing Voyager to make a turn beyond a course of 020 degrees when not
ordered to do so;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	Failing to correctly carry out orders transmitted from Melbourne to
Voyager;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	Failing to correctly receive orders transmitted from Melbourne to
Voyager;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	Causing or permitting Voyager to take up a course of other than that
indicated by signals from Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	Failing to correctly transmit as orders, signals received from
Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(f)	Causing or permitting Voyager to proceed on a course across and close to
the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	Causing or permitting Voyager to proceed upon a course and at a speed
taking her across and close to the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(h)	Failing to alter the course or speed of Voyager in time to avoid a
collision;</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	Failing to maintain a constant and efficient watch;</b>
<P>

<b>(j)	Failing to observe in sufficient time or at all that if the course and
speed of Voyager and Melbourne remained constant a collision
was likely to
occur;</b>
<P>

<b>(k)	Failing to warn Melbourne that Voyager was proceeding upon a course
across and close to the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(l)	Failing to warn Melbourne that a collision was imminent;</b>
<P>

<b>(m)	Failing to give right of way to Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(n)	Failing to ensure that Voyager and its equipment were in a seaworthy and
safe condition;</b>
<P>

<b>(o)	Failing to ensure that all persons on Voyager were properly trained and
prepared for the eventuality of a collision or other catastrophe;</b>
<P>

<b>(p)	Failing to maintain any or any adequate lookout.</b>
<P>

18  	Similarly, there are particulars of negligence given in relation
to the officers of the HMAS Melbourne and further particulars
of negligence of
other officers and servants of the Commonwealth of Australia.
<P>

19  	I accept that it was not until 1998 when the plaintiff read the
statement of claim that he became aware of the connection between
the personal
injury and the defendant's acts and omissions.  This falls within the time
period stipulated by s 60I(1)(b).  The plaintiff
has passed through the s
60I(1)(a)(iii) gateway.
<P>

20  	As the plaintiff has passed through all three s 60I(1)(a)
gateways I turn to consider whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the
limitation period.
<P>

<b><u>Just and reasonable</u></b>
<P>

21  	I turn now to consider whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period.  The nature of the discretion conferred
by s
31(2) of the <b>Queensland Limitations Act</b> was considered by the High Court
in <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186
CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1.</a>  Section 31(2) is almost identical to s 58(2) of the New
South Wales <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.</b>  The Court of Appeal has applied
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> in <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited
v Giudice</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 7 March 1999) and <b><u>Commonwealth of
Australia v McLean</u></b> (1997) 14 NSWLR p 389.
<P>

22  	Firstly, I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has a real
case to advance.  In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>, the applicant bears an evidentiary and
persuasive onus which, in the absence of concession, requires material to be
adduced which
demonstrates that the dilatory plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  The need for the court to decide that it is just and reasonable
to
extend the limitation period must focus attention on the question whether there
is indeed evidence to establish the plaintiff's
cause of action.  It would
rarely be possible to say that it was just and reasonable to subject the
defendant to litigation otherwise
statute barred if it did not appear that
there was evidence available to the plaintiff to establish his cause of action.
(See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported Badgery-Parker J, 1

<P>

23  	The defendant did not make any submissions on this issue.  The
plaintiff was employed by the defendant.  The defendant as employer
of the
plaintiff had a duty of care to the plaintiff.  The foreseeability of the
plaintiff's damage will be in issue at the trial.
 It is the plaintiff's
contention that as a result of his experience of being on board the Melbourne
when it was hit by the Voyager
he suffered PTSD.  There is medical evidence to
support this claim.  There is evidence from the plaintiff that had he not been
involved
in the collision he would have continued with his career in the Navy
for at least 30 years.  The plaintiff has had 27 jobs since
discharge from the
Navy.  There is evidence to establish that the plaintiff has a real case to
advance.
<P>

24  	I turn now to <b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  In
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J referred to the effects of delay in the now often
quoted passage which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Second, it is
oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long
after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Third,
people
should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on the
basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

25  	and;
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.</b>
<P>

<b>In such a situation, actual injustice to one party must occur.  It seems
more in accord with the legislative policy underlying limitation
periods that
the plaintiff's lost right should not be revived than that the defendant should
have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

26  	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

<b>"The applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant prejudice
to the prospective
defendant."</b>
<P>

27  	and;
<P>

<b>"The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised in
favour of an applicant lies on the applicant.  To discharge
that onus the
applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant
prejudice to the prospective
defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a
limitation period, to allow
the commencement of an action outside that period
is  prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the
benefit
of the limitation."</b>
<P>

28  	He continues:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question: Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires an
extension."</b>
<P>

29  	In <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> the Court of Appeal considered the
effect of <b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to the extension of the limitation
period of a case which falls into subdivision 2 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b>
1969 - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a>.  
<P>

30  	Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  The President quoted the passage by McHugh J
which begins "Legislatures enact" and was of the view that Dawson J agreed with
McHugh J.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that Dawson J and
McHugh J appeared to indicate that it is mandatory
that the applicant negate
"significant prejudice" before the discretion could be exercised in his or her
favour. 
<P>

31  	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed
themselves in the following terms.
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

32  	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the
notion of "significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances
of a fair trial unlikely".  In determining whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period in this
application I will examine whether the
delay has made "the chances of a fair trial unlikely" or whether the defendants
would suffer
"significant prejudice".
<P>

33  	The defendant referred to specific matters which it submitted
caused it actual prejudice.  It submitted that it is prejudiced
to such an
extent that it will not be able to obtain a fair trial.  The specific matters
are that firstly, on 17 December 1998 the
plaintiff's Department of Defence
files numbered 1/93563 (Service Details) and 21/28/1631 (Service Details -
Repatriation) were destroyed
in accordance with approved National Archives
procedures and secondly, that Dr John McGeorge a psychiatrist has since died.
Dr McGeorge
treated the plaintiff and noticed a change in his personality.  The
plaintiff's solicitor produced a copy of the plaintiff's records
of service
card and computer historical records which show the details of the plaintiff's
service with the Royal Australian Navy
(Ex A). These documents were forwarded
to the plaintiff's solicitor by the Defence Personnel Executive by letter dated
26 May 1998.
 The plaintiff's statement of claim was filed and presumably
served on or about 14 October 1998.  Yet the Department of Defence destroyed
the plaintiff's records on 17 December 1998 which was a few months after the
statement of claim had been served.  If a defendant
choses to destroy its own
records when it is on notice that a claim is lodged it is difficult to see how
they can assert that they
are prejudiced.  While Dr McGeorge cannot give
evidence, the medical records which still exist may be tendered into evidence.
Other
doctors including another psychiatrist namely Dr Reynolds treated the
plaintiff during his period of service in the Navy.
<P>

34  	The defendant has admitted the collision but denied it was
negligent.  As I have previously stated I accept that with the passing
of 35
years, there is the real possibility that some witnesses may not be available
to give evidence at the trial.  It can also be
expected that memories will have
faded with the effluxion of time and some witnesses may no longer be alive or
able to be located.
  Indisputably there is presumptive prejudice. 
<P>

35  	Generally speaking, the lengthy delay may well confront the
defendant with a difficult task in investigating a claim for damages.
 There
are Navy records showing that at the time that when the plaintiff joined the
Navy he was in good physical and psychological
health.  There is documentary
evidence of the plaintiff's psychiatric state during his period of service in
the Navy.  The events
surrounding the collision between the Melbourne and
Voyager are well known and there is documentary evidence available - see
<b><u>McLean v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 41 NSWLR 389</a> and
<b><u>Lynch v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 16
October 1998, Master Harrison).  There are also decisions in relation to
extension of time of the limitation
period for Voyager/Melbourne claims by
Master Malpass.  
<P>

36  	After I have taken into account all of these matters,  I am not
satisfied that the "chances of the defendant obtaining a fair
trial iare
unlikely" nor am I satisfied that the defendant will suffer "significant
prejudice".  The plaintiff has discharged his
onus and satisfied me that it is
just and reasonable that an order be made that the limitation period be
extended.  The appropriate
order for costs is that costs be costs in the
cause.
<P>

37  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings in this court for damages in respect of an
accident which occurred
on 10 February 1964 up to and including 14 October 1998.
<P>

(2)	Costs are costs in the cause.
<P>
