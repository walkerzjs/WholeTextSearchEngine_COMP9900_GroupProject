<b>JUDGMENT -- ex tempore</b>
<P>

<b>10 May 1999</b>
<P>

1	I am asked to approve a scheme of arrangement between ETRADE Australia
Limited ("the Company") and its shareholders. The relevant
formal matters about
which the Court is required to be satisfied are dealt with in affidavits noted
in the transcript.
<P>

2	The only matter of substance concerns the issue of 10,000 additional shares
pursuant to exercise of 10,000 listed options by a
Mr Ooi which occurred
<i>after</i> the scheme meeting approving the scheme by over 99% on 29 April
1999 and thus was excluded from the benefit of the scheme. Those
shares have
subsequently been traded on the ASX, that is to say, in the ordinary course of
anonymous trading.
<P>

3	The scheme, were it not amended, would fail to cover these shares so issued.
ASIC appears as amicus curiae. It does not oppose
the course proposed by the
Company to deal with this matter; that the Court, as contemplated by cl 5.2 of
the scheme, should approve
the scheme subject to an alteration or condition
which I will describe in more detail below.
<P>

4	Essentially what is proposed is that the Company will adopt a scheme altered
to provide that one of its directors, Kerry Roxburgh
give up the benefit of the
scheme for 10,000 of his shares whilst the option-holder in question, Mr Ooi is
to be allowed to participate
in the scheme. This is to be so, notwithstanding
that the relevant shares issued pursuant to his exercise of option were
allotted
<i>after</i> the scheme meeting, namely on 30 April, 1999, the day
after.
<P>

5	By two separate Deed Polls, the first from the Company and the second from Mr
Roxburgh, binding effect is given to the substitution
of Mr Ooi's 10,000 shares
as beneficiary of the scheme for Mr Roxburgh's 10,000 shares.
<P>

6	Counsel for the Company, Mr Campbell, QC, informed the Court that (to be
confirmed by affidavit) a cheque, which apparently failed
to identify the
relevant option-older, was received by the Company on 29 March 1999. There is
some uncertainty as to whether the
Company also received on 17 March 1999 or
thereabouts, a separate notice of exercise, though the relevant option-holder
claims it
was sent. Completion of the actual allotment of shares pursuant to
these steps took place, as I have said, on 30 April 1999, with
the mechanical
steps being effected by Miss Pearson as Company secretary, pursuant to
delegated authority in that behalf from the
Company.
<P>

7	In those circumstances, I am satisfied that there was a binding contract as
at 31 March 1999, being the last date under the scheme
for exercising options
in order to participate. Such contract was one which entitled Mr Ooi to have
allotted to him shares the subject
of his options. In those circumstances, it
could not be said that the scheme, if now altered as proposed, would come
within the stricture
of McLelland J in <i>Re Application of B and S
Distributors Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20492" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 492</a> where he said:
<P>

"It is my opinion that on the true construction of s315, the Court is not
empowered to approve a scheme purporting to bind a future
class of creditors,
i.e. a class, members of which might not be in existence or ascertainable as at
the date of the meeting at which
the scheme is agreed to. However, as a matter
of practice I would think it undesirable that the Court should convene a
meeting of
a class of creditors unless all members of that class are in
existence at the date of the Court order because if the class were defined
in
such a way as to include creditors who might come into existence after the date
of the Court order albeit before the date of the
meeting, there is a very
serious risk that such creditors would not have proper notice of the
meeting.
<P>

It may be that in special circumstances I would be proper to permit the class
to be defined in such a way as to include creditors
not in existence at the
date of the order but in existence at the date of the meeting, but in the
ordinary case, of which I think
this is one, such a course should not receive
any encouragement from the Court."
<P>

8	In other words, Mr Ooi was an option-holder in existence and ascertainable as
at the date of the relevant meeting, who had exercised
his option and was
contractually entitled to have the relevant shares allotted to him. Thus there
would be nothing contrary to the
proper construction of s411 of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, which would preclude my approving the alterations
contemplated or would make it undesirable that I give such approval. In <i>Re
Gwalia Consolidated Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2027%20ACSR%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 27 ACSR 674</a> at 675-6 I discussed the
relevant authorities insofar as they may affect the efficacy of a scheme which
purports to bind option-holders
prospectively in relation both to their options
and the shares they receive on exercising the options and concluded that such a
scheme
could be approved. What I said there is consistent with the approach
that I consider should be taken here. I note also in <i>Re Matine Limited and
Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 ACSR 268</a> at 285-6 I dealt with the power of the court to
consent to alterations comparable to those here contemplated, concluding that
there
was no impediment to do so. In this case, as in <i>Matine</i>, but
unlike<i> Kempe</i>, the scheme is to be altered <i>before</i> it is approved
by the Court. Though it is to be altered after shareholder approval,
shareholders approved the scheme knowing it could
be altered. I set out below,
for convenience, the relevant passage from that judgment. 
<P>

"I should finally deal with two other matters. If one leaves aside the express
power of extending the time contained in clause 3.2,
the Plaintiffs contend
that there is a further means by which a court can extend the time stipulation
under a scheme of arrangement.
It is said that if the court has already
approved the scheme and it has become effective, the court can subsequently
vary a time
stipulation under the power contained in Pt 2 rr3(1) and (2)
<i>Supreme Court Rules</i> to extend any time fixed by an order of the court.
This is on the basis that the terms of a scheme of arrangement form part of an
order of the court for the purposes of this rule: <i>Caratti v Hillman</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20WAR%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] WAR 92</a> at 94 and 95; <i>Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd v State of Western
Australia</i> <i>(No. 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%207%20WAR%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 7 WAR 61</a> at 68.
<P>

While the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Kempe v Ambassador Insurance Co
(in liquidation)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 271</a> appears inconsistent with that approach,
the Plaintiffs contend that it is firstly not binding on this Court, secondly,
is incorrect
and thirdly, should not be followed as a matter of comity between
Australian courts administering the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

The Plaintiffs also contend that <i>Kempe</i> is not applicable in the present
case because, unlike the scheme in <i>Kempe</i>, the schemes have not yet been
approved by the Court. Further, s99 of the <i>Bermuda Companies Act</i>, which
the Privy Council had to consider, contains no mechanism such as s411(6) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, whereby the court could sanction a scheme with
variations which had not been explicitly approved by the shareholders' (or
creditors')
meeting considering the Scheme.
<P>

It is not necessary for me to consider this further means of extending a time
stipulation, given the alternative bases for that
result. However, as I
presently see matters, I would for the reasons earlier put follow the
Australian cases, were it necessary."
<P>

9	Finally, I should note that Austin J in <i>Morgan &amp; Banks Limited</i>
(Austin J NSWSC, 27 January 1999, unreported) approved a scheme of arrangement
with alterations of similar scope.
<P>

10	Where, as here, the additional shares were allotted after the scheme closed
but would have been allotted before, had notice of
exercise been connected to
the cheque, the option-holder being contractually entitled in that behalf, and
given that shareholders
are not affected in any adverse respect by the
alteration and finally where tracing the relevant shares acquired by Mr Ooi via
CHESS
offers no certainty that this is feasible, I am satisfied that the scheme
should be approved with the alterations submitted. I note
in that regard that
ASIC concurs in this course. I approve the Scheme accordingly.
