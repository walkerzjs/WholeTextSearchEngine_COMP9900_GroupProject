DECISION: 
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

<b>General Outline</b>
<P>

1	The question for decision is whether OAL Superannuation Fund Pty. Limited
(OAL), the trustee of the OAL Superannuation Fund is
bound as such trustee to
make a distribution of surplus to fund members, pursuant to a resolution of its
directors of 27 January
1998.  OAL seeks a declaration that it is not so bound.
The first defendant, Olivetti Australia Pty. Limited (Olivetti), the principal
employer referred to in the deed, seeks a declaration that the trustee is not
so bound, but that if it is then it is also bound to
make a distribution of
surplus to it.  Mr. Langley, the second defendant, who is joined as a party to
represent the fund members
as at 18 November 1997, seeks a declaration that the
resolution conferred upon the represented parties an entitlement to a
distribution
from surplus and seeks an order that this be effected.  By late
amendment which I allowed, subject to the issue arising being determined
at a
later time, Olivetti seeks a declaration that a deed dated 5 December 1997
amending the trust deed is invalid.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2	The fund was established by trust deed and rules dated 11 February 1977.
That deed and rules were, in accordance with their provisions,
completely
replaced by an amending deed, with new rules dated 13 March 1996, which rules
have also been amended.  The only part of
the original deed which it is
necessary to set out, not for the determination of the present questions, but
for the determination
of the final question which is to be tried by separate
subsequent hearing, is the preamble or recital, which is as follows:
<P>

WHEREAS
<P>

1.	The Principal Company has agreed to establish an indefinitely continuing
Fund to be known as the Olivetti Australia Staff Superannuation
Fund to provide
individual personal retirement and other benefits for such of the employees of
the Principal Company and of any associated
or subsidiary company as shall
become members of the Fund.
<P>

2.	The Trustee has agreed to act as the first trustee of the Fund.
<P>

3	The relevant provisions of the replacement rules are set out below.  As is
usual in these matters the deed is short and most of
the relevant provisions
are set out in rules attached to the deed, which are themselves referred to as
"articles".

including this Rule PROVIDED THAT no amendment shall be made which shall alter
the object of the Fund
as defined in the preamble to the Original Deed.
<P>

CONTRIBUTIONS
<P>

MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS</center>
<P>


<P>

10.2	A Member shall contribute from the date of becoming a Member such amount
as is required by the Benefit Schedule applicable
to the Member.
<P>

10.3	Contributions in respect of a Member shall be deducted from his wages or
salary by the Company and the amount of such contributions
so deducted shall be
paid by the Company to the Trustee in such manner and at such times as agreed
between the Company and the Trustee
in accordance with the Statutory
Requirements.
<P>

<center>COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS</center>
<P>


<P>

10.4	(a)	The Company shall contribute to the Fund in relation to the Member
such amount as is required by the Benefit Schedule applicable
to the Member.
<P>

	(b)	The Company may by notice to the Trustee suspend contributions required
under paragraph (a) in relation to any or all of the
Members in the employment
of the Company and the Trustee shall adjust the benefits of the Members to
reflect the suspension of contributions
after considering the advice of the
Actuary.
<P>

4	The rules provide for three categories of members, namely A, B and C.  All
category B and C members are also category A members,
but all category A
members are not category B or C members.  The category A benefits appear to
arise from prior membership of a separate
fund merged with the Fund constituted
under the original deed, upon the 1996 deed being entered into.  No
contributions are required
of members of this fund, the employer contributing
such amount as it determines or as it is required by law to provide.  Those
contributions,
and any voluntary contributions of members, are credited to what
is called an SG account for the member and invested.  It is an accumulation
account.  On retirement or withdrawal or death or disability the member is
entitled to the balance in the SG account of such member.
 Category B and C
benefits are defined benefits.  The category B member contributes 3.5% of
salary to the fund and the category C
member contributes 5% salary to the fund.
The employer contributes the balance necessary to fund the defined benefits.
The amount
of the defined benefit varies depending upon whether it is a normal
retirement benefit, an early or late retirement benefit, a withdrawal
benefit,
or a benefit payable upon disability or death.  For the purpose of this action
it is not necessary to go into this with
more particularity.
<P>

5	By 1997 there was a considerable surplus in the fund available to pay the
defined benefits to the category B and C members.  It
is to be appreciated that
there could be no surplus in the fund representing the entitlements of members
in category A, who are entitled
to the full amount of the net SG account and
not to any defined amount.  When I refer to surplus I refer to surplus being
the amount
in excess of liabilities to members of the fund taking into account
of course further contributions and expected liabilities.  On
13 November 1997,
Olivetti asked OAL as trustee to "examine how best to utilise the surplus in
the fund's assets.  This is to be
done in such a way as to repatriating a
proportion of the surplus back to the company while, ensuring a distributed
proportion of
the surplus among the members, always maintaining adequate
provision for the on-going requirements of the fund." [sic]
<P>

6	This letter was tabled at a meeting of directors of OAL on 18 November 1997,
when it was agreed to commence the necessary steps
for repatriation, for the
process to be reviewed regularly, and terminated if the trustees were not
convinced that the repatriation
was in the interests of members, it being
agreed that advice and recommendations would be obtained from the fund
actuaries administrators
and solicitors.
<P>

7	Prior to this resolution, Messrs. Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, Actuaries, had
written to Mr. Garsia, a director of Olivetti, referring
to  the question of
distribution of surplus, and advising on some of the steps which would be
necessary to achieve this and the legality
of such steps.  This was followed by
letter dated 14 November 1997 to Mr. Swanbury, Divisional Manager Finance and
Administration
of Olivetti, setting out in simple form the steps required to
"facilitate repatriation of surplus to the company".  Step 3 was the
requirement for an amendment to the trust deed to allow this repatriation.  On
2 December 1997 the directors of OAL resolved to amend
the trust deed in
accordance with advice from the actuaries.  Pursuant to this an amending deed
was executed on 5 December 1997,
reciting the intention of the amendments was
to facilitate use of the surplus for the benefit of members and the principal
employer,
reciting rules 2.22 and 2.23 and that the trustee and the directors
of Olivetti considered that the amendments complied with the
requirements of
those rules 2.22, and adding to Article 5 of the rules the following:
<P>

5.8	(a)	The Trustee, with the agreement of the Principal Employer and on the
advice of the Actuary, may deal with any surplus by
decreasing the rates of
contributions or by increasing the rates of benefits or by repatriating surplus
to the Principal Employer
or partly by one method and partly by the other or in
any other manner and either temporarily or indefinitely, including the carrying
forward to any surplus or deficiency.
<P>

	(b)	The Trustee must not carry into effect any repatriation of surplus to the
Principal Employer in accordance with paragraph (a)
of this Rule unless such
notice has been given to Members, such resolutions passed and such other
requirements of the Act complied
with as the Trustee considers appropriate,
having due regard to the Complying Superannuation Fund status of the Fund.
<P>

8	The Actuaries prepared an actuarial valuation of the fund as at 1 July 1997
indicating a surplus of $12.2 million in relation
to accrued benefits and $9.6
million in relating to total service benefits.  The trustees had previously
been advised by the actuary
that if some of the surplus was to go back to
Olivetti as principal employer it would be necessary for additional benefits to
be
provided for members utilising part of the surplus for that purpose.  The
actuaries by letter dated 5 January 1998 explained various
ways in which
benefits could be increased.  I set out parts of that letter:
<P>

	An uplift in benefits could be achieved in a number of ways for defined
members, including:
<P>

	leaving the defined benefits as per existing Rules, but dividing up part of
the surplus among members with each member's share
being credited to his or her
accumulation account to be paid as an additional benefit.
<P>

It would also have to be decided to what extent Category A (accumulation)
members would participate in the distribution.
<P>

There are a number of ways of dividing up surplus on implementing an
apportionment as per the last dot point above, and some possibilities
are set
out below.  In the figures following we have assumed that the accumulation
members and the SG Accounts for defined benefit
members would be eligible for
surplus, but not transfer and voluntary contribution accounts.  All amounts
shown are as at 1 July
1997.
<P>

 (Basis 1)
<P>

 (Basis 2)
<P>

	<b>Division in proportion to Account balances including Member Accounts and a
notional Company account equal to Member Accounts for defined
benefit members
(Basis 3):</b>
<P>

	A notional Company account could be taken to make an allowance for the Company
financed component of the defined benefit liabilities.
 For example a common
percentage of the Member Account balance could be used, say 100% which is the
Company withdrawal benefit on
full vesting.  This differs from Basis 1 in that
the vesting factor is always 100%.  On this basis the total of the account
balance
would be increased to $5,446,447.
<P>

9	On 21 January 1998, Mr. Mazzi, the Managing Director of Olivetti wrote to OAL
enclosing various letters of advice and went on
to say:
<P>

	We request that you consider distributing the amount of $2,444,000 among the
Members and we would ask you, the Trustees of the
Fund, to examine and
implement the most appropriate and effective methodology to achieve the
distribution.
<P>

	Furthermore, we wish to have the amount of $8million to $8.5 million
repatriated to the Company from the Fund's assets, leaving
the balance of the
surplus of the Fund to cover all ongoing requirements of the Fund.
<P>

Under Rule 1.4 the Trustee was entitled to act on a letter signed by the
Managing Director of Olivetti.
<P>

10	On 27 January 1998 the directors of OAL met and considered the question of
distribution of surplus, the advice received, and
the letter from Olivetti
dated 21 January 1998.  The relevant minute is as follows:
<P>

	<b>REPATRIATION OF THE  FUND'S SURPLUS ASSETS</b>:
<P>

	Further to the meeting held on 18 November 1997 and the investigations
effected to ascertain whether it were possible to repatriate
a proportion of
the Fund's surplus assets back to the Company while at the same time assessing
a distribution/proportion of the said
surplus among the Members of the Fund
always maintaining adequate assets in the Fund in respect of Members and the
Fund's ongoing
viability in accordance with actuarial advice.
<P>

	The Trustees received a letter dated 21 January 1998 from Olivetti Australia
asking the Trustees to consider distributing an amount
of $2,444,000 among the
Members.  Having obtained all relevant legal and actuarial particulars from the
Fund's actuaries, it was
moved to proceed.  The Trustees will be undertaken to
notify the members that a distribution of $2,444,000 is to be made in a manner
assessed as fair by the Trustees. [sic]
<P>

	After due consultation and advice from the Actuaries, it was resolved to
distribute the allocation on the following criteria:
<P>

1.	All Members in the employment of the Company as at 18 November 1997.
<P>

2.	A proportion of the Member benefit is derived by the aggregation of the
following criteria:
<P>

a)	Member contribution to Plan B or C.
<P>

b)	Company contribution to Plan B or Plan C vested at 100%
<P>

c)	Company contribution to Plan A.
<P>

3.	All new Members of Plan A who joined the company since 1 July 1997 to
receive a minimum of $100.00.  Similarly with any Member
whose entitlement
comes to less than $100; they too to receive a minimum payment of $100.
<P>

Furthermore, a request was made by the Company to repatriate to it between $8
million and $8.5 million leaving the balance of the
assets in the Fund to meet
all requirements of the Fund as per an actuarial certification to be provided
by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes.
<P>

11	On 29 January 1998 at a meeting of trustees of the trust the minutes of the
previous meeting were distributed and taken as read
and the following
resolution was passed:
<P>

		<b>REPATRIATION OF THE</b>
<P>

<b>FUND'S SURPLUS ASSETS</b>	Further to the meeting held on 27 January the
matter of the repatriation of the Fund's surplus assets was discussed and the
following
was resolved:
<P>

	1.	That the Fund's actuaries be asked to confirm the amount to be retained in
the Fund out of the Fund's assets to meet accrued
liabilities and to allow for
the ongoing viability and security of the Fund and how much could be
repatriated to the Company.
<P>

	2.	That the Fund's actuaries be asked to provide a list of individual amounts
to be credited to Members on the basis adopted at
the Trustees' meeting of 27th
January 1998.
<P>

	3.	That three Trustees meet to compile a set of questions and answers for the
benefit of Members.
<P>

12	On 31 January 1998, a fax was received by Mr. Mazzi at Olivetti from Mr
Keating, who appears to be a member of a French legal
firm handling some
takeover negotiations between Olivetti and Wang Corporation, requesting that
the distribution not proceed during
the negotiations with Wang, and stating
that it was imperative that it not be implemented in the period as it had
potential implications
for the agreement.  Following upon this Mr. Mazzi, who
was by then the managing director of Olivetti, wrote to OAL as follows:
<P>

	Further to my letters dated 13th November 1997 and 21st January 1998, I have
to inform you that the Parent Company has instructed
me to rescind the
Company's request to repatriate any of the OAL Superannuation Fund's surplus
back to Olivetti Australia Pty. Limited
or to the members of that fund.
<P>

	Consequently, please note that allocation in this regard has to cease
forthwith.
<P>

	
<P>

13	This request was noted at a meeting of directors of OAL on 3 March, although
no resolution seems to have been passed in connection
with it, although it was
noted that the trustees "were instructed to cease all action concerning the
repatriation."
<P>

14	It seems that the trustee may have considered that it was still bound to
continue the repatriation process and sought agreement
to this pursuant to rule
5.8.  Olivetti responded stating the instructions from the parent company were
not to continue, that it
would not agree to the repatriation and that "an
agreement between the company and trustee was never entered into for this
repatriation
to take place".  The final thing which happened relevant to these
proceedings is a resolution of OAL of 4 May 1998, pursuant to which
the trustee
resolved to cease all action relating to what was described as the repatriation
process.
<P>

<b>Questions for decision</b>
<P>

15	These are:
<P>

A.	Whether the letter from Olivetti of 21 January 1998 was an agreement to the
Trustee dealing with the surplus of $2.444 million
so as to distribute it among
the members.
<P>

B.	Whether the resolution of the Trustee on 27 January 1998 was a dealing with
surplus giving rise to accrued rights in members.
<P>

C.	Whether any consent could be withdrawn.
<P>

D.	Whether if the resolution created accrued rights, the Trustee was bound to
distribute from surplus an amount of between $8 million
and $8.5 million to
Olivetti.
<P>

<b>Questions C and D</b>
<P>

16	It is convenient to answer these questions first.  If the resolution of the
Trustee gave rise to accrued rights to benefits these
could not be reduced or
withdrawn by the purported withdrawal of consent.  The rules could not be
amended to bring this about (Rule
2.23(b)) and regulation 3.1.6 of the
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulation 1994 would prevent this.  This
disposes of
question C.
<P>

17	As to D, which arises on the cross-claim, while there is no doubt that the
genesis of the proposals was a desire in Olivetti
to strengthen its balance
sheet by means of a capital injection from part of the fund surplus, it is
impossible to read the letter
of 21 January 1998 as making consent to the
distribution of $2.444 million in any way conditional upon repatriation of an
uncertain
amount between $8 million and $8.5 million to Olivetti.  Nor could
the resolution of the trustees, if it gave rise to accrued rights,
in some way
give rise to the other obligation because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sia1993473/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">S117(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sia1993473/" class="autolink_findacts">Superannuation
Industry (Supervision) Act 1993</a> (Commonwealth) would operate to prevent any
such obligation from  arising unless its pre-conditions were met as would <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sia1993473/s5.8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule
5.8(b)</a> of the fund rules.  
<P>

<b>Question A - the letter of 21 January 1998.</b>
<P>

18	I consider this letter was an agreement to distribute $2.444 million of the
surplus among members.  Agreement could mean no more
than consent.  The
important paragraph in that letter is
<P>

	We request that you consider distributing the amount of $2,444,000 among the
Members and we would ask you, the Trustees of the
Fund, to examine and
implement the most appropriate and effective methodology to achieve the
distribution.
<P>

19	The words "examine and implement" are a clear authority to the Trustee to
determine the method of distribution and to bring it
about.  This authority is
not conditional upon the subsequent paragraph relating to a wish to have part
of the surplus repatriated
to the company, although obviously the Trustees were
intended to consider this and it was expected they would take the necessary
steps to bring it about.
<P>

<b>Question 6 - the effect of the trustees resolution</b>
<P>

20	I have set out rule 5.8A.  The resolution as to surplus does not decrease
rates of contribution or increase rates of benefits.
 So the question is
whether the resolution is a dealing with any surplus in any other manner,
namely a manner not amounting to an
increase in rate of benefit or decrease in
rate of contribution.  The question is really whether the resolution moved
$2.444 million
from the fund assets which were not allocated to benefits, to
members accumulation accounts, giving members accrued rights which
could not be
taken away.
<P>

21	In oral evidence Mr. Bowyer, a director of the trustee, stated the trustee
by its resolution adopted the basis for apportionment
among members being basis
three in the letter from the actuaries of 5 January 1998, subject to all
members receiving at least $100.00.
 The following evidence was given by him in
cross-examination at p6 of the transcript:
<P>

Q:	The first criterion was to identify the members who would participate in the
allocation, agree?
<P>

A:	Agreed.
<P>

Q:	The second step required determining how that amount would be divided up
between members, didn't it?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	The dealing first with members who were members of plan B or plan C, it was,
you take an amount of their member contribution?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	Secondly, you take account of a company contribution vested at 100 per
cent?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	And that was one of the proposals Sedwick Noble Lowndes' letter of 5
January?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	The proposal in the third dot point that I took you to?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	Then the third criterion was to take the company contribution to plan a, see
that, and again that is an amount for which an account
for each member is
kept?
<P>

A:	Correct.
<P>

Q:	Just pausing there, the effect of doing that would be that for each member
of the fund you would arrive at a particular dollar
figure representing some of
those three items, wouldn't you?
<P>

A:	That is correct.
<P>

Q:	And what was resolved was that the, at least at this step, was that the
interest or the share rather of each member in the $2,444,000
benefit would be
calculated by taking the dollar sum for that member and dividing of the dollar
sums for all members?
<P>

A:	Correct, it ended up by actuaries doing those calculations.
<P>

Q:	A calculation based on those criteria?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	There is a twist, perhaps because of resolution 3, what I suggest to you is
that by criterion 3, having done that exercise, you
could see whether any
members would receive less than $100, and I suggest that if you found or the
actuaries found that they would
do so, such members who were members of plan 1,
joining the company since 1 July 1997 WITHDRAWN.
<P>

Q:	And I suggest that if you found that that was the case, then you would have
to give that person $100 allocation of benefit?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	And then rework the figures by reducing the $2,444,000 available for
allocation by how many sums of $100?
<P>

A:	That was purely so that we would each have something, and say we have "X"
number of people joined that date, you are entitled
to $100, and the rest
calculated on this criteria.
<P>

Q:	You agree that those calculations are merely an arithmetical instrument to
apply the criteria upon which the directors resolved
on 27 January?
<P>

A:	Yes, this was the basis on which they were calculated.
<P>

Q:	There was nothing to be done by the directors of the trustees to increase
the benefits of members by amounts to be calculated
in accordance with those
criteria as you understood it?
<P>

A:	No, it was just purely based upon this criteria and we would get it
calculated on in this manner.
<P>

Q:	If this proceeded and any person reached retirement age say, and retired,
what would have happened is that person would received
his or her
superannuation entitlements under plan A?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	His or defined benefit under C or D if he or she was a member of those
plans?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	And the benefit calculated in accordance with those criteria?
<P>

A:	Correct.
<P>

22	The competing arguments on the question of accrued rights can be summarised
as follows:
<P>

	A.	The trustee and Olivetti, say that there was no dealing with the surplus
giving rise to any accrued right because:
<P>

		(i)	The benefits to be allocated to each member had not been calculated;
<P>

		(ii)	It was not decided whether the proportionate part of the fund would be
allocated to the members' accumulation account or
to the members' contribution
account in the case of Category B or Category C members.
<P>

		(iii)	The benefit which the member might ultimately receive had not been
allocated.
<P>

		In addition the plaintiff says that the transaction was a complicated one
involving distributions of surplus to employer and employee,
and that the
letter from Olivetti and the resolution must be considered within that factual
matrix.  I have already rejected this.
 The plaintiff also says that the
resolution envisaged notification to members and the carrying out of whatever
actions were necessary
to enable part of the surplus to be paid to the employer
and that before this was achieved the trustee resolved to cease all action.
<P>

	B.	The members say that the resolution gave rise to accrued or immediate
rights because it was not a resolution authorising the
carrying out of some
further action, but a resolution operating of itself to vest a benefit in them
with no further action being
required by the trustees, but rather some
administrative action by the actuaries to apportion the benefit to the members'
accumulated
accounts.
<P>

23	There is strength in the arguments of both sides.  In some ways it is better
to ask whether the resolution gave rise to a present
entitlement to have the
benefit credited rather than to talk of an accrued right because the
determination of accrued benefits can
give rise to confusion.  See <u>J.
Edstein: The Meaning of Accrued Rights</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1996%2025%20ATR%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1996 25 ATR 35.</a>  In <b><cite>Turner
v S.R. Nominees Pty. Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2031%20ATR%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 31 ATR 578</a>, which concerned
rights to distributions of trust income pursuant to resolutions of a corporate
trustee, Santow J held that a resolution
in the following words prima facie
created a present entitlement in the beneficiaries mentioned:
<P>

	It was resolved that the following distributions be made by the Romautu
Trust:
<P>

	C.L. Turner $1,977.00
<P>

L.J. Turner $1,977.50
<P>

B.K. Turner $3,977.50
<P>

by crediting their respective loan accounts
<P>

	
<P>

In that case it is likely that the crediting of the books was to be carried out
by the trustee rather than by the actuary, but it
was the resolution not the
crediting which was held to establish the entitlement.  That would support the
members' case here.
<P>

24	I do not think there is any doubt as to the fund or account which was to be
credited.  It could only have been the accumulation
account held by all members
being the Category A account.  The other accounts were defined benefit accounts
not accumulation accounts.
<P>

25	In some ways the situation which is under consideration in this case is
analogous to rights which arise on declaration of a dividend
by a company.
Such a dividend can be paid only out of profits and in strict terms the
dividend is that part of the profits the company
decides to distribute to
shareholders.  Declaration of a final dividend gives rise to a debt payable to
the shareholder immediately
or upon the date stipulated for payment:
<b><cite>Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20137%20CLR%20567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 137 CLR 567</a> at
572.  In that case the resolution provided for a dividend partly in cash and
partly by distribution of shares in another company.
 The declaration of
dividend was declared invalid but it appears to have been accepted that had it
been valid an immediate right
would have arisen, albeit that right would have
included a right to transfer of shares which would have required further action
on
the part of the company.  In the same way an immediate right in shareholders
arises on declaration of a final dividend of a total
amount which would require
division among shareholders in proportion to shares held over total shares
issued.  The position in the
instant case is somewhat similar.  The trustees
resolved to distribute a particular sum from the actuarial surplus to members.
They
clearly regarded themselves as having dealt with the surplus.  The
resolution of 29 January 1998 makes this clear because item 2
of the resolution
which I have set out assumed an entitlement in the individual members.  There
was nothing further to be done by
the trustees, the allocation to members being
a purely administrative step resulting from mathematic calculations flowing
from ascertainable
certain figures.  The matter is not altogether certain and
is somewhat finely balanced, but I conclude that pursuant to the resolution
of
27 January 1998 the members obtained accrued or immediate rights.  That being
so there was no ability to take those rights away.
<P>

26	Finally, I have not dealt with the argument of counsel for the members that
the decision not to proceed was not a decision made
in good faith.  It is not
disputed that the affairs of pension funds must be conducted in good faith.
The lack of good faith is said
to have been on the part of Olivetti.  That is
not really relevant here.  If there were consent to a distribution I see no
reason
why that consent could not be withdrawn on instructions from a holding
company prior to the distribution taking effect.  There is
nothing to suggest
the reason for those instructions involved some act of bad faith.
<P>

27	The result of this is that the summons should be dismissed.  A declaration
should be made as sought in paragraph 1 of the first
cross-claim to declare the
members rights, and an order should be made as sought in paragraph 2 of that
cross-claim to give effect
to that declaration.  The claims made in the second
cross-claim, other than that in paragraph 1(A), should be dismissed.  The claim
in paragraph 1(A) has already been fixed for hearing on 8 March 1999 when final
orders can be made.
<P>

I certify that paragraphs <b>1 to 27</b> are a true copy of the Reasons for
Judgment given by Mr Justice Windeyer in matter <b>3139/98 OAL Superannuation
Fund Pty. Ltd.  v  Olivetti Australia Pty. Ltd.</b>
