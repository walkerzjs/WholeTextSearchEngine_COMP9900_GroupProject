<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  On 12 May 1999 Suzette Louise Glasby was
convicted by me of contempt of court for refusing to answer a number
of
questions directed to her as a witness in the trial of Gary Zane Glasby in this
Court for murder on 15 April 1998.  The circumstances
of the commission of
these offences are sufficiently set out in my judgment on conviction and I do
not propose to repeat them here.
 I pointed out, in characterising the
seriousness of the offences, that the prisoner intended to interfere with the
administration
of justice.  She undoubtedly knew facts about the murder of
Theissel and the implication of her husband which were of great importance
in
the trial.  In the result, disclosure of this material was not vital to the
Crown case since her husband was convicted on other
evidence of a largely
circumstantial kind.  I concluded that the prisoner deliberately undertook to
frustrate an appropriate and
necessary exploration of the evidence she was able
to give because she thought that that evidence might implicate her husband and
that she dishonestly attempted to exculpate him for a cold-blooded contract
killing in which she was herself involved.  I have no
doubt that this was a
course of conduct designed, if possible, and to the extent to which she was
able, to frustrate the due administration
of justice in respect of her
husband's guilt, of which she was well aware.  The suggestion made to his
Honour Justice Sully that
she declined to identify the true killer because she
was frightened to do so was not pressed before me and I am satisfied that it
was false.  The prisoner was given every opportunity by the Judge to resile
from the position she had adopted and her position was
carefully explained to
her.  What she did was, therefore, a conscious and deliberate defiance of the
law.  To use the language of
Mahoney JA in <i>Smith v The Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25
NSWLR 1</a> at 23 -
<P>

"Conduct of this kind will not be deterred by admonition or by gesture:  it is
necessary that the punishment for it be direct, immediate
and exemplary."
<P>

2   	Although the prisoner had not received any benefit by
indicating an intention to give evidence at the time that she was dealt
with on
her plea of guilty to the murder of Theissel, the contempts were committed in
the context of a trial for the most serious
crime in the criminal calender and,
indeed, one that fell within the most serious class of case for that crime.
She has not indicated
the slightest contrition.  
<P>

3   	The prisoner's personal history is set out in the judgment
of Sully J when he sentenced her for murder on 11 November 1997
and, as his
Honour observed, it makes sad reading.  I do not think it necessary to set this
material out in this judgment.  I should
mention, however, that I accept that
at the time she was involved in the crime for which she was then sentenced, she
was very much
under the influence of her husband who, as Sully J found, was, "a
brutal and vicious man with a truly chilling criminal history".
 To some
degree, I think that she was motivated by a sense of misplaced loyalty to her
husband in committing the contempts of which
I have found her guilty allied,
perhaps, with a foolish bravado.  The prisoner has a young daughter, still
being cared for by her
mother so far as I am aware, and to whom she has regular
access.  I am prepared to accept that there is some prospect of future
rehabilitation,
although the behaviour that has given rise to these offences
significantly qualifies this likelihood.  
<P>

4   	As Sullly J noted, the prisoner had made two past attempts
at suicide.  She was on methadone and has continued to receive it
which leads
to the hope that she will one day be free of the need to take drugs.  It
appears that she has completed some drug and
alcohol related courses.  
<P>

5   	The prisoner was sentenced for murder to penal servitude
for twelve years comprising a minimum term of nine years commencing
on 30
September 1997 and expiring on 29 September 2006 and an additional term of
three years commencing on 30 September 2006 and
expiring on 29 September 2009.
The principle of totality must apply to the sentence which I impose.  Together
with Sully J, I am
of the view that there is present in this case a number of
factors capable of amounting to special circumstances.  However, I consider
that increasing the additional term of three years imposed by his Honour by one
year appropriately reflects the prisoner's needs
for rehabilitation and
supervision upon her release into the community at the expiration of the
minimum term which I propose to impose.
<P>

In the result I sentence Suzette Louise Glasby for the contempt of court
committed on 15 April 1998 constituted by her refusal to
answer a question as
to what was the name of the person whom she said that she knew to have killed
John Theissel to a term of six
years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of
two years commencing on 30 September 2006 and expiring on 29 September 2008 and
an
additional term of four years commencing on 30 September 2009 and expiring
on 29 September 2012.
