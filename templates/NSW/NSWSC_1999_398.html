<i>Friday, 30 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1804/97	CHIVADA PTY LIMITED   -v-   LISTAMAR PTY LIMITED &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>There is presently before the Court a
Notice of Motion filed by the defendants, Listamar Pty Ltd., Helen Dyball and
WP Services &amp;
Installation Pty Ltd., on 27 May 1997.  By that Notice of
Motion the defendants seek a review of the orders made by Registrar Berecry
on
20 May 1997 and an order that the plaintiff give such security as the Court
thinks fit for the costs of the defendantS of and
incidental to the
proceedings.   The defendants also seek consequential orders. 
<P>

2   	The orders made by the Registrar on 20 May 1997 were made
in an application by the present defendants for security for costs.
 The
Registrar on that day dismissed the application of the defendants, that the
plaintiff provide security for the costs of the
defendants, and the Registrar
also ordered the defendants to pay the costs of the plaintiff of the
application before him.  
<P>

3   	It will be noted that the present application for review of
the Registrar's decision was filed on 27 May 1997.  At least part
of the very
lengthy delay between the filing of that Notice of Motion and its hearing this
day is due to problems which the parties
encountered in obtaining a transcript
of the ex tempore oral judgment delivered by the Registrar on 20 May 1997.
That delay, however,
is not of any particular significance to the present
application which has proceeded substantively as a hearing of an application
for security for the costs of the defendants. 
<P>

4   	The applicant defendants bring the present application
pursuant to the provisions of Part 53 rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules
and
pursuant to the provisions of section 1335 of the <i>Corporations Law.
</i>Subrule (1) of Part 53, rule 2 provides relevantly:
<P>

Where in any proceedings, it appears to the Court on the application of a
defendant ---
<P>

(e)	that there is reason to believe that a plaintiff being a body corporate
will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if
ordered to do so, 
<P>

the Court may order that plaintiff to give such security as the Court thinks
fit for the costs of the defendant of and incidental
to the proceedings and
that the proceedings be stayed until the security is given.
<P>

5   	Subsection (1) of section 1335 of the <i>Corporations Law
</i>is to similar effect.  That subsection provides:
<P>

Where a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding, the
court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it
appears by credible
testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable
to pay the costs of the defendant
if successful in his, her or its defence,
require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all the
proceedings until
the security is given.
<P>

6   	The substantive proceedings relate to a dispute between the
plaintiff on the one hand and the defendants on the other concerning
the sale
of a business by the defendants to the plaintiff and the subsequent resale of
the same business by the plaintiff back to
the defendants.  
<P>

7   	For the purposes of the present application it is not
necessary to set forth the details of the substantive proceedings or
of their
procedural history. Suffice it to say, however, that there is no suggestion by
the defendants in the present application
that the substantive claim of the
plaintiff should be regarded as one which is hopeless or one which is totally
without merit.  The
applicant defendants bring the present application on the
basis that, so it is submitted, the plaintiff is a $2 company, and that
its
assets are such, so it is submitted, that if it loses the substantive
proceedings and a costs order is made against it, then
the successful defendant
will have no means of recovering those costs and they will be left to bear
their own costs completely. 

<P>

8   	The plaintiff, in resisting the application for security
for costs, points to evidence relating to the shareholders and directors
of the
plaintiff company and submits that those persons are fully able to meet any
costs order which might be made against the plaintiff.
 I am prepared to accept
that their financial resources are such that they could meet such a costs order
if they choose to do so.
 There is no legal obligation upon the shareholders or
the directors to meet any costs order which might be made against the plaintiff
company.  There is no certainty that, if the plaintiff were unsuccessful in the
substantive proceedings and a costs order were made
against it, its
shareholders and directors would choose to pay those costs.  
<P>

9   	The evidence which has been placed before the Court
concerning the financial position of the plaintiff itself includes profit
and
loss statements for the year ended 30 June 1997 and for the period July to
December 1998.  Those profit and loss statements disclose
that in the year
ended 30 June 1997 the plaintiff made a net profit of almost $16,000 whilst in
the preceding year it made a loss
exceeding $73,000.  For the period of six
months in the latter half of 1998 the plaintiff had what is described as a net
income of
$2100.  Those figures are all very well, but they do not really
assist the defendants if the defendants ultimately are successful
in obtaining
a costs order against the plaintiff.   Of much more significance is the balance
sheet of the plaintiff company as at
30 June 1997.  That balance sheet
discloses a total deficit for the year ended 30 June 1997 of $57,203.  One of
the elements comprising
that balance sheet and a factor in the total deficit is
the item disclosed as shareholders loans which total for that year $184,668,
being an increase of almost $20,000 over the same item for the preceding year,
which was in an amount of $166,000. 
<P>

10   	It will be appreciated that the shareholders (being the
gentlemen who on behalf of the plaintiff, so it was submitted, had
the personal
financial ability to meet any costs orders) are, of course, fully entitled
whenever they so desire to call in those
loans.  The consequence would be that
the financial situation of the plaintiff would be one of insolvency and there
would be even
less likelihood that any costs order made against the plaintiff
would be recovered by the defendants.
<P>

11   	In an application of this sort the Court must, in
exercising its unfettered discretion, look, not only to the situation in
which
the defendants would find themselves if they were successful in obtaining a
costs order against the plaintiff, but also to
the effect upon the plaintiff of
any order for security which the Court might at this stage of proceedings make
against the plaintiff.
 There is, however, in the instant case no suggestion on
behalf of the plaintiff that, if an order for security were to be made,
it
would have the effect of stultifying the substantive proceedings or of
preventing the plaintiff from bringing those proceedings
to a final hearing.
Indeed, the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff concerning the
financial resources of those standing
behind the plaintiff would suggest
entirely to the contrary --- that if an order for security for costs were to be
made there would
be sufficient financial resources available from the
shareholders of the plaintiff and there would be no problem in such security
being provided.
<P>

12   	In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that this is an
appropriate case in which the Court should order security.  There
is evidence
placed before the Court by the solicitor for the defendants concerning the
costs expected to be incurred by the defendants
in bringing the matter on for
hearing.  The amount of those costs is shown in the evidence as totalling
$26,000.
<P>

13   	No evidence from the plaintiff has been placed before the
Court to suggest that the defendants' evidence as to that figure
is inaccurate
or unreliable or that some other, and lesser, figure should be adopted.   
<P>

14   	Accordingly, I propose to order that the plaintiff provide
security in the sum of $26,000 and that the proceedings be stayed
until that
security is provided.
<P>

15   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the orders made by the Registrar on 20 May 1997 be
discharged.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff provide security for the costs of the defendants
in the sum of $26,000, such security be in a form
acceptable to the Registrar
and that the proceedings be stayed until such security is given.
<P>

3.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendants of the Notice of
Motion filed by the defendants on 27 May 1997 and
of the Notice of Motion filed
by the defendants on 1 May 1997. 
<P>

4.	I grant leave to the defendants to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>
