<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  I am not prepared to grant leave to the Crown to
cross-examine the witness on any of the three bases sought.  For
the purposes
of these findings, I do not need to examine further the meaning of the term
"unfavourable" and the concept underlying
it, since the Crown has linked his
argument to the difference between what the witness said in the ERISP and what
she now says.
<P>

2  	Firstly as to that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38(1)(a)</a>, I do not consider leave
appropriate because the only unfavourability that is suggested is the
distinction between what the witness
now says and what she said in the
electronically recorded interview and the disparity between the two accounts,
insofar as there
is one, is insufficient to justify taking that course.
<P>

3  	As to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38(1)(c)</a> basis, I am of the view that the prior
account is not so materially different from the present as to warrant taking
the course sought
and that is really a finding very much the same as the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38(1)(a)</a> finding.
<P>

4  	As to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38(1)(b)</a>, I have been invited by Mr. Temby and the Crown
to have regard not only to the written material comprising the statements and
the
electronically recorded interview transcript, but also to the demeanour of
the witness and the way in which she gave her evidence
in the witness box.
<P>

5  	I am of the view that the witness was patently a person of whom I
conclude, that on numerous occasions throughout her testimony,
she was not
making a genuine attempt to give evidence frankly and fully.  She was certainly
making an attempt to give evidence, but
evidence as limited as possible on
particular subject matter, that being matter, such that one could reasonably
conclude about which
she might reasonably be supposed to have knowledge.  In my
view, she sought so to qualify and limit what she had said as to deprive
it of
any real value.
<P>

6  	However, bearing in mind the limited difference between the
version given to the police in the ERISP, and for which the Crown
now contends,
and that which she actually did give at the end of the day, and that her
reluctance to make a genuine attempt to give
evidence fully and frankly, was
evidenced clearly to the jury in her demeanour and the way in which she
answered questions on numerous
topics, I do not consider, in the exercise of my
discretion, I should grant leave to cross-examine on that basis either.
