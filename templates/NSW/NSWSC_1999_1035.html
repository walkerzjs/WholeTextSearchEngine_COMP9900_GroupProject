<P>


<P>

1   	By Summons, each of the plaintiffs have commenced
proceedings as an appeal by way of stated case from decisions of Stoddart
M, at
the Burwood Local Court in respect of proceedings brought by Toplot Pty Limited
(`Toplot') against Milad Sarkis Raad (`Raad')
in the Civil Claims Jurisdiction,
for monies owed under a contract for sale of a real estate business.
<P>

2   	The background facts are that in early 1991, Toplot agreed
to buy a Real Estate agency and three rent rolls from P &amp; M
Jones Real
Estate Pty Limited (`Jones'). Four separate agreements were entered into. All
the sales were concluded on 16 April 1991.
Three of the agreements dated 22
March 1991 were drawn by Raad, who was the solicitor for Jones.
<P>

3   	Clause 3 of the Rent Roll Agreements provided for a
retention fund to be invested by Raad. The funds were to be released in
circumstances set out in Clause 3(b) of each Agreement.
<P>

4   	Raad paid approximately half of the retention funds of the
sum of $15,000, but disputed Toplot's claim for the remainder. Raad
released
the balance of the retention funds, some of which were paid to himself, and
paid other debts of Jones.
<P>

5   	In the proceedings, Toplot claimed that Raad breached
Clause 3 of the Rent Roll Agreements and that Raad owed a duty of care
to
Toplot to exercise reasonable skill, care and diligence, and competence as a
solicitor, to invest the retention funds and to release
the funds only in
accordance with the agreements, and that Raad held the retention funds on trust
and had a fiduciary relationship
duty to Toplot, and that he had a duty not to
abuse his position and to use due skill and care in the conduct of his affairs.
The
amount claimed was $15,782.14 as liquidated damages.
<P>

6   	The court hearing, which was lengthy and involved
protracted cross-examination, had been preceded by a considerable number
of
procedural motions and preliminary hearings, with protracted hearings in
relation to pleadings and the issues in the proceedings.
The hearing was
followed by extensive written submissions before determination by his Worship,
who found that the principal issue
for determination by the court was the<b>
</b>interpretation of the three rent roll Agreements, and in particular cl 3.
There was no issue that Raad was acting for Jones in relation
to the
agreement.
<P>

7   	The Learned Magistrate found, on a preliminary issue
relating to Toplot filing a Notice of Discontinuance, that Toplot had
an
entitlement to recommence the proceedings. Raad's contention was that Toplot's
witness, Mr Kenneth Wolf, failed to substantiate
his legal entitlement in
respect of three subject properties, giving rise to the entitlement of a
refund.
<P>

8   	His Worship found that Mr Wolf, Toplot's witness, was
unable to give evidence to substantiate Toplot's claim, and His Worship
found
that Raad was entitled to disburse the retention funds in the way that he
did.
<P>

9   	The Learned Magistrate found for Raad, and made an order
for costs against Toplot, but declined to make that order for costs
on an
indemnity basis.
<P>

10   	The Summons filed by Raad attaching a Stated Case on the
order for costs, sought a declaration that the determination of the
Learned
Magistrate was erroneous in point of law, and sought an order reversing,
affirming or amending the determination, and that
the stated case which was
attached to the summons be remitted to the Magistrate. Costs were also
sought.
<P>

11   	The costs judgment was made on 4 May 1998, and awarded
defendant's costs assessed at $8,300.00.
<P>

	<b>Toplot's Contentions</b>
<P>

12   	The grounds contended by Toplot in its Stated Case were
that His Worship erred in finding that the word "may" in cl 3 of the
Rent Roll
Agreements would reinforce the overriding inference that only genuine claims
were to be subject to a refund, and that His
Worship erred in finding that the
proper interpretation of cl 3 was that claims made by Toplot were required to
be substantiated
in a manner required by Raad, or at all.
<P>

13   	It was further contended that His Worship erred in finding
that Toplot was required to substantiate his claim for the retention
money, and
that His Worship erred in failing to find in favour of Toplot, that the stake
held by Raad was not held as a pre-estimate
of damage, but as an earnest of
performance.
<P>

14   	It was further contended by Toplot that his Worship erred
in finding that Raad breached his fiduciary duty in making the payments
that he
did, and it was further contended that His Worship failed to give proper
consideration to the allegations of negligence when
he made a decision in
relation to Toplot's complaint against Raad.
<P>

15   	It was also contended that the Magistrate erred in his
assessment of costs in favour of Raad.
<P>

<b>Raad's Stated Case on Costs</b>
<P>

16   	The grounds of determination as set out in the Raad Stated
Case were that the Learned Magistrate did not accept the submission
that
although the case was lengthy, there was nothing adduced in the evidence
sufficient to give rise to the court finding that exceptional
circumstances
existed.
<P>

17   	Further, it was contended that the Learned Magistrate also
rejected the claim for witness expenses in respect of the plaintiff
himself,
and that the Learned Magistrate did not consider it necessary to state and
specify reasons for that rejection.
<P>

18   	Raad further asserted that the claim for fees paid to
counsel was rejected pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> rules 3 and 7 of <i>the Local Courts
(Civil Claims) Rules</i>, and costs were assessed on the recommended scale for
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act </i>1970</a>.
<P>

19   	Raad further asserted that the Learned Magistrate did not
make an express finding in relation to the defendant's submission
that it did
not award costs on an indemnity basis, and thus any award of costs leaving the
defendants substantially out of pocket
would result in grave injustice, and
that the Learned Magistrate should have exercised his discretion to alleviate
that injustice,
and to make an award in the lump sum that was not less than
two-thirds of the total expenses incurred.
<P>

20   	The Learned Magistrate stated that it was implicit in his
judgment that he did not consider that he was at liberty to make
an award or
grant any costs other than permitted by Pt 31 of <i>the Local Courts (Civil
Claims) Rules</i>, if a case for indemnity costs was not made out.
<P>

21   	His Worship in his judgment on costs applied principles
set out in <i>Hurstville Municipal Council v Barry Connor &amp; Anor </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991)
24 NSWLR 724</a>, and that there must be some form of reprehensible or
inappropriate conduct, or some other exceptional circumstance, such as whether
proceedings are in the nature of a test case or involve the public interest.
His Worship found there was no such conduct, and the
fact that costs would not
fully compensate the successful party, or the unsuccessful party's cases
without merit, did not constitute
sufficient grounds for certifying special
circumstances.
<P>

<b>Raad's Contentions</b>
<P>

22   	Raad contended that in relation to the costs order, the
Learned Magistrate had failed to exercise his discretion in accordance
with
true principles of law, and had failed to properly take into account the facts
in evidence relevant to the exercise of that
discretion.
<P>

23   	It was further contended that the interpretation adopted
by the Learned Magistrate to use <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims)
Rules</i> 1988</a> in his costs order was wrong and erroneous in law, and that he
should have taken into account <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/index.html#p31a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims)
Rules</a>.</i>
<P>

24   	Raad further contended that the claim for witness'
expenses was rejected without valid reason, and further that His Worship
had
erred in holding that there was nothing in the evidence sufficient to give rise
to a finding that special circumstances existed,
and that his discretion had
miscarried in finding that there needed to be blameworthy conduct before an
indemnity order could be
made.
<P>

25   	Raad contended that the basis of the Toplot cause of
action was false and deliberately concocted, and that the witness had
conducted
himself by multiplying allegations upon allegations to prolong the litigation,
and thus caused Raad to incur liability
for costs far beyond what he could have
reasonably expected to incur in litigation of genuine issues, and that Toplot
had initiated
and maintained the proceedings as an abuse of process, and that
Toplot should have known that it had no chance of success.
<P>

26   	The Raad Stated Case contended that the Learned Magistrate
failed to apply the true test for an order for indemnity costs.
<P>

27   	The Raad Stated Case proposed for determination the issue
of whether the determination on costs was erroneous in point of
law, and
therefore Raad was entitled to indemnity costs, or if not, that Raad was
entitled to an order for costs that would not leave
him out of pocket by more
than one-third of the total reasonable costs and expenses to be incurred by
him, and whether there was
an error of law in rejecting witness' expenses for
Mr Raad, and as to whether his Worship was not at liberty to take an award of
costs other than pursuant to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/index.html#p31a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lccr1988299/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts
(Civil Claims) Rules</i> 1988</a>.
<P>

	<b>Appeal by Way of Stated Case</b>
<P>

28   	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</i> 1970</a> provides
that where a party is dissatisfied with a judgment or order of the court as
being erroneous in point of law, that party
may appeal by way of Stated Case
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s101</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</i> 1902</a>. Where a Magistrate is entitled to
decide a matter of facts, a Magistrate is entitled to so decide it unless the
Magistrate has wrongly
applied some legal principle in reaching that decision:
<i>Dennis v Watt </i>(1942) 43 SR 32.
<P>

29   	This court is obliged to determine the question of law
arising, and shall reverse, affirm or amend the determination or remit
the
matter to the Justice with the opinion of the court, or make such other order
as seems fit, and the court may make such order
as to costs as it seems fit.
This discretion granted to the court in the use of the words "make such other
order in relation to the
matter as seems fit", confers a wide discretion:
<i>Mitchell v Nestle Australia Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2036%20A%20Crim%20R%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 36 ACR 119.</a>
<P>

<b>The Parties' Submissions</b>
<P>

<b>Toplot's Stated Case</b>
<P>

30   	The court was provided with extensive submissions in
addition to oral submissions in the proceedings.
<P>

31   	The submissions of Toplot on the issue of liability relate
to what was essentially a finding of fact by His Worship, and do
not in any way
reveal any error of application of law on the part of His Worship. His Worship
found a contractual relationship between
Jones and Toplot. There is evidence
capable of supporting His Worship's inference of fact, and there is nothing to
show that His
Worship misdirected himself as to law.
<P>

32   	The Learned Magistrate found that the plaintiff's evidence
consisted of tendering an affidavit and a large number of documents,
but on
many occasions the plaintiff asserted that there was correspondence in
existence, but was unable to support his oral evidence
by specific documents.
His Worship found Mr Wolf's evidence, upon which Toplot relied, less than
convincing.
<P>

33   	There is no evidence that supports Toplot's contentions
that Raad was negligent or that any fiduciary duty existed, or that
there was
any breach.
<P>

34   	I do not therefore find that His Worship erred in relation
to the contentions set out in the stated case.
<P>

35   	In the light of costs in the sum of $8,300, the amount is
not, in the circumstances of the case and the length of time that
it took, in
any way excessive, and thus in that respect was not in error.
<P>

36   	The question of interlocutory orders, and whether they are
taken into account, is a matter clearly within the discretion of
the Learned
Magistrate.
<P>

37   	I therefore find no error in Toplot's contentions set out
in 4.1 to 4.12 of the Stated Case, and determine that the Learned
Magistrate's
determination was not erroneous in point of law.
<P>

38   	I affirm the determination in respect of which the case
was stated.
<P>

<b>Stated Case of Raad as to Costs</b>
<P>

39   	Counsel has made extensive submissions in relation to
costs.
<P>

40   	As to the contention that the defendant is entitled to an
award of costs on an indemnity basis, there have been a number of
determinations to which I have been referred. It is useful to refer to
<i>Wentworth v Rogers </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 534.</a> That was a case where a trial was
extensively prolonged by extensive allegations of facts, and although the case
was without merit,
the court there held that it had not been commenced to
prolong litigation, and although the allegations made were in many matters
scandalous, they were not made with deliberate falsehood.
<P>

41   	I was also referred to <i>Fountain Select Meats v
International Product Merchants </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2081%20ALR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 81 ALR 39</a>, which held that where an
applicant was properly advised and should have known that he had no chance of
success, in such cases the
action must be presumed to have been commenced or
continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard.
<P>

42   	An examination of the evidence in this matter, and of the
extensive cross-examination, shows that although the evidence of
the witness
for Toplot was not accepted, there was clearly no restraint on either party in
terms of continuing the proceedings and
the making of allegations. The fact
that Mr Wolf was an unimpressive witness does not thereby entitle Raad to a
finding that the
matters were such as to come within the cases that I have
cited, or <i>Degman Pty Limited v Wright (No. 2) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%202%20NSWLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 2 NSWLR 534.</a> No
basis has been shown for the making of an order for indemnity costs in applying
the above authorities.
<P>

43   	The exercise of the discretion by His Worship in relation
to the claim for indemnity costs shows that he examined the extensive
submissions put before him. His Worship referred to the principles in
<i>Hurstville Municipal Council v Connor &amp; Anor </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20724" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 724</a>,
and applied the principle that to award costs on an indemnity basis, there must
be some form of reprehensible or inappropriate conduct,
or some other
exceptional circumstances, as in proceedings which are in the nature of a test
case or involve the public interest.
Clearly, on the examination of the
evidence here, there was no blameworthy conduct, or anything bringing it within
the principles
applied by His Worship.
<P>

44   	His Worship found that there was nothing adduced in the
evidence sufficient to give rise to the court certifying that special
circumstances existed. It appears to the court that His Worship applied the
correct principle, and that no case was made out justifying
an order for
indemnity costs.
<P>

45   	The order that was made as to costs therefore did not
constitute an error of law in terms of the question of indemnity costs.
<P>

46   	His Worship, in determining costs, is vested with a wide
jurisdiction. His Worship did not, in expressing his reasons, say
that he was
bound to apply the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 3. He told the court that he had
regard to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 3, and referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 7, but did not
express himself to necessarily be applying to them. It was open to His Worship
to apply the scale, whether it formally
applied or not.
<P>

47   	His Worship however did, in the Stated Case, say that he
had felt constrained by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/lcr180/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/lcr180/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Court Rules</a></i>. His Worship was
no longer constrained by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/lcr180/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a>, but <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/lcr180/index.html#p31a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31A</a> applied, and therefore the scales,
although open to His Worship to adopt, did not in fact bind him. I consider
that His Worship did
not intend, by the tenor of his judgment, to fully
reimburse Raad for what was a very substantial costs assessment, in the light
of the jurisdiction and in the light of the amount claimed.
<P>

48   	The obligation of Raad is to show error on the part of His
Worship. The fact that a very considerable sum was charged for
costs, and that
sum exceeded by some fifty percent the amount of the actual claim, does not
show that the amount claimed was a proper
sum. It seems to the court that the
amount of costs ordered, in the light of the discretion available to His
Worship, was within
a proper exercise of discretion.
<P>

49   	Although the amount of costs did not of itself constitute
an error, the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/lcr180/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> of the Rules constituted an error. It is
therefore appropriate for this court to re-examine the costs ordered, and the
court may
refer the matter back to His Worship for determination of that
sum.
<P>

50   	I am concerned however that the costs of this matter going
back before the Learned Magistrate, and the incurring of further
costs in
relation to a costs order, would make an order referring it back to His Worship
a very expensive exercise. I consider in
the circumstances that, in using this
court's power to make such order as is appropriate on the Stated Case, that
this court should
substitute an order as to costs in the sum which would have
been proper in the circumstances, taking into account the extensive
interlocutory
proceedings and the complex nature of the preparation for the
hearing.
<P>

51   	I consider that a proper sum in the circumstances would be
the sum of $12,000 for costs, which is substituted for His Worship's
order.
<P>

52   	In the event, Toplot has failed in its Summons, and Raad
has succeeded in part in respect of his Summons. It seems to me therefore
that
Raad should have an order for costs against Toplot in respect of the
hearing.
<P>

53   	The orders that I make therefore are:
<P>

1.	That the Summons of Toplot be dismissed and the decision of His Worship as
to the verdict is affirmed.
<P>

2.	On the summons for a stated case by Raad, that the decision of His Worship
is affirmed except in the amount of costs.
<P>

3.	The court substitutes for the sum of $8,300 the sum of $12,000.
<P>

4.	Toplot is to pay Raad's costs of these proceedings.
