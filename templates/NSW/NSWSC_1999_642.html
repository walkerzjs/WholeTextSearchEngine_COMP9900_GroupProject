<b>WEDNESDAY 23 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>2859/99 - RONALD JOHN DEAN-WILLCOCKS V ATTT INVESTMENTS PTY LTD &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>This is an application under section
477(2A) of the Corporations Law seeking that the plaintiff liquidator be
entitled to compromise
certain claims of the first defendant company as against
the third defendant.
<P>

2   	The first, second and third defendant companies, the first
two in liquidation, the third under administration, are all related.
 The
plaintiff, who is a registered liquidator, is the liquidator or administrator
of them all.  Before they became subject to external
administration, the
companies were controlled by a Mr Gallagher and a Mr Stotter, the latter
appears to be the son of the former.
 Mr Gallagher was also involved at some
stage as a director and evidently still as a shareholder in Project and General
Finance Pty
Ltd which is a secured creditor of some or all of the first three
defendants.
<P>

3   	I will assume that the first three defendants are
insolvent.  There are intergroup transactions.  There is a secured debt to
Project and General Finance Pty Ltd and there are unsecured debts owing to
general creditors.
<P>

4   	The liquidator has obtained statutory declarations from Mr
Gallagher and Mr Stotter which suggest that neither of these gentlemen
is, to
put it colloquially, worth powder and shot.  The scheme that has been worked
out is that the secured creditor will inject
some moneys into the companies. It
will take a particular asset.  The claims of Mr Gallagher and his associates
will be deferred.
 The independent unsecured creditors will be paid 100 cents
in the dollar and the intercompany debts will virtually be wiped out.
 At least
the third defendant will then go back and trade.  The first two defendants will
remain in liquidation.
<P>

5   	The liquidator has made an affidavit that he does not
believe that the ordinary unsecured creditors of the first and second
defendants are disadvantaged by the orders sought in the summons and further,
that in his opinion the compromise is a commercial
resolution of the relevant
debts.
<P>

6   	The liquidator is given power under s 477(1)(c) of the
Corporations Law to make any compromise or arrangement with creditors
or
persons claiming to be creditors.  However, subsection 2A of that section
provides that:
<P>

"Except with the approval of the Court, of the committee of inspection or of a
resolution of the creditors, a liquidator of a company
must not compromise a
debt ..."
<P>

of the current magnitude.
<P>

7   	There is a dichotomy in the section between a compromise
and an arrangement.  A compromise usually means a situation where
there is some
doubt about a claim and a lesser sum is taken so that the X factor will vanish.
Ordinarily there must be a bona fide
dispute existing before there can be a
compromise resolving that dispute; see <b>Mercantile Investment and General
Trust Co v International Co of Mexico</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%201%20Ch%20484" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 1 Ch 484n</a>, 489 and 491.  An
arrangement deals with every other commercial transaction that a reasonable
business person might carry out bona
fide in the course of running a business:
<b>Re E D White Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1929/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] NSWStRp 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281929%29%2029%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1929) 29 SR (NSW) 389.</a>
<P>

8   	Subsection 2A, which was introduced by one of the
Corporations Law Reforms Acts following the Harmer Report, only applies to
compromises.  It does not apply to arrangements. Just what the Court is
supposed to do when considering such applications is not
made clear by the Law.

<P>

9   	Mr Cussen, the solicitor for the plaintiff, says that the
Court's role is limited to seeing whether the compromise is flawed,
certainly
not to reappraise the compromise commercially. He says the main concern of the
Court is the interest of creditors. Whether
compromise is commercially sound is
a matter for the creditors and the liquidator rather than the Court.  
<P>

10   	What, then, is the Court to do?
<P>

11   	I think some guidance is given by what the Court has to do
in cases where it approves of the commencement or settlement of
litigation.
Such provisions were inserted in the legislation so that the Court, which is
experienced in the vicissitudes of litigation,
could advise the liquidator in
the light of that knowledge as to whether the litigation contemplated or being
settled is proper;
see <b>Waisbrod v Potgieter</b> [1953] 4 South African Law
Reports 502 at 507. The same thought extends to compromises.
<P>

12   	There has in recent years been some analysis by the Court
of its role under s 477(2A) and similar sections.
<P>

13   	First, it is clear that the controlling notion is the
interests of creditors; <b>Re Spedley Securities Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%209%20ACSR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 9 ACSR 83</a>, 85.
In that case, Giles J said at pp 85-6, (omitting authorities), "...the court
pays regard to the commercial judgment of the liquidator.
That is not to say
that it rubber stamps whatever is put forward by the liquidator but... the
court is necessarily confined in attempting
to second guess the liquidator in
the exercise of his powers, and generally will not interfere unless there can
be seen to be some
lack of good faith, some error of law or principle, or real
and substantial grounds for doubting the liquidator's conduct."
<P>

14   	I considered the history of the allied jurisdiction of the
Court contained in s 477(2B) of the Corporations Law in <b>Re GA Listing &amp;
Maintenance Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2015%20ACSR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 15 ACSR 308.</a>  Austin J further considered that
subsection in <b>Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2029%20ACSR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
29 ACSR 109</a> and reached the view at p 118 that the Court does not decide the
relevant question, but permits the liquidator to decide it.<b> </b>
<P>

15   	I do not really consider that the present arrangement
between the company in liquidation and the other parties is a compromise
within
the meaning of s 477(2A) because there is no dispute about the moneys owing.
The problem is that the persons who could be
proceeded against by the
liquidator to get money in for the benefit of creditors appear not to be worth
powder and shot.
<P>

16   	Accordingly, the liquidator is prepared to agree to an
arrangement whereby the creditors will get 100 cents in the dollar
in any
event.  I think that is an arrangement, not a compromise, which he can do
without my authority.
<P>

17   	If however I did have to become involved, then I would not
be prepared to give the liquidator my imprimatur at this stage.
 There are a
number of very disturbing aspects of this case.
<P>

18   	The Court, when it is asked to give an approval, cannot
ignore the general public interests involved.  It must, of course,
keep
predominantly in mind the interests of the creditors but there is always a
public interest that persons who have caused the
downfall of a company should
not be allowed to escape from any consequences of those actions by coming to a
deal with the creditors
even if those creditors get some money that they
otherwise would not obtain.  There is also the public interest that insolvent
companies
should not go back into the market place to trade.
<P>

19   	The matter was commenced by summons filed this morning. I
was told it was an urgent matter in which a decision really had
to be made
today or tomorrow.  I was given papers to digest which are about ten
centimetres thick and it may be that in the hour
that I have had to look at
them I have not obtained every nuance.  However, people who ask for a quick
decision with a bulk of papers
take that risk.  The Court can only act on the
material it has in the time it is given to digest it and on the submissions of
solicitors
or counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

20   	I have previously drawn attention to the problems that
this approach to the present sort of case causes; see <b>Re Lemon Tree Passage
&amp; Districts RSL &amp; Citizens Club Co-operative Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%206%20ACLC%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 6 ACLC 24</a>
as has Mandie J in <b>Re Aslor Pty Ltd </b>(1997) 24 ACSR 612<b>. </b>The Court
requires that it be presented with the relevant material in a clear way with
appropriate assistance to consider the material
in the available time.  If the
Court is not satisfied that it can do its duty on the material submitted, it
has the obligation to
ask for further material and to dismiss the application
if that further material is not made available.
<P>

21   	I have a number of problems with the material presented in
the instant case. These include the fact that the secured creditor
seems to be
in the same camp as the directors.  The secured creditor and the directors put
in the liquidator or the administrator
to the first, second and third
defendants. There is no independent thought being given to this particular
compromise.  Despite the
fact that the plaintiff is a well-known experienced
liquidator, and I am not saying a thing against his integrity or competency,
the Court is extremely reluctant to act where there is no proper contradictor.

<P>

22   	Accordingly, I would not have been prepared to act unless
another highly experienced liquidator had at least perused the papers
and given
his or her independent view that the matter was in the interests of the
creditors.  Secondly, I would have needed to be
assured in accordance with
authorities such as <b>Re The Federal Bank of Australia Ltd; Re McConnell</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281893%29%2015%20ALT%20126" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1893) 15 ALT 126</a> (even though that decision is on a differently worded
Companies Act) by a positive statement that the compromise would be beneficial
to the company and its creditors and briefly why.  A statement such as in the
present affidavit that the liquidator does not believe
that the ordinary
unsecured creditors will be disadvantaged is insufficient.  Thirdly, the
statutory declaration received from Mr
Gallagher makes no mention at all of the
apparent fact that during the last 12 months over five million dollars was
extracted from
these companies for the benefit of key employees as "incentives"
and that the key employees appear to include Mr Gallagher and his
son.  The
moneys were supposed to be "an incentive to the future performance of these
employees".  There is not a word said in the
statutory declaration or otherwise
as to where this five million dollars has gone.  It would appear that it has
been on lent to some
other body connected with Mr Gallagher, but there are just
no details at all.  The Court would have thought that an independent person
would have made enquiries as to that and given the Court and the creditors some
indication where the money had gone.
<P>

23   	If this were a matter within jurisdiction then the Court
would not have dismissed the summons at this stage but deferred the
matter
until further evidence was obtained. However, as it is not a compromise it
seems to me I should just dismiss the summons,
unless invited to do otherwise.
However, for the reasons that I have stated, the liquidator should think very
seriously as to whether
his professional reputation is worth going ahead with
this arrangement.  At the very least, the liquidator should consider whether
he
should investigate further and then amend the summons to seek directions under
s 479(3) of the Corporations Law; cf <b>Re Tietyens Investments Pty Ltd
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1999/206.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] FCA 206</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2017%20ACLC%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 17 ACLC 697.</a>
<P>

24   	I will stand the matter over to 9.30am in my list on
Tuesday 29 June 1999 with liberty to apply.
