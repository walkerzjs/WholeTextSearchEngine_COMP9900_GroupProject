<P>

<b>2919/99	MFX RESEARCH PTY LIMITED   -v-   SOUTHERN EQUITY HOLDINGS LIMITED
&amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>ACTING MASTER:   </b>The second and third
cross-claimants have filed a notice of motion seeking the following orders:
<P>

1.	At paragraphs 30, 59 to 62, 67 and 69 to 72 of the amended cross-claim be
struck out as against the second and/or third cross-defendants
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part
15</a> rule 26 of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

2.	Alternatively, an order that the amended cross-claim be stayed or dismissed
as against the second and/or third cross-defendants.
<P>

2   	The fourth cross-defendant has also filed a notice of
motion seeking the following orders:
<P>

1.	An order that the fourth cross-defendant cease to be a party to the
proceedings pursuant to Part 8 rule 9 of the Supreme Court
Rules.
<P>

2.	Alternatively, an order that the cross-claim as against the fourth
cross-defendant be struck out pursuant to Part 15 rule 26
of the Supreme Court
Rules.
<P>

3.	Alternatively, an order that the cross-claim as against the fourth
cross-defendant be dismissed pursuant to Part 13 rule 5 of
the Supreme Court
Rules.
<P>

3   	In each notice of motion the applicants seek their costs of
the application. 
<P>

4   	The cross-claimant carried on business as an investment
company. The first cross-defendant carried on business relating to
commercial
software development and licensing. The second cross-defendant (Ferrier) has,
since 29 May 1998, been chairman of directors
of the first cross-defendant and
was appointed as a director of the cross-claimant on 12 February 1999.
Subsequently on 13 April
1999 he ceased to be the director of the
cross-claimant. The third cross-defendant (Carr) was appointed as a director of
the first
cross-defendant on 22 September 1997 and has acted as its managing
director. The fourth cross-defendant (Freeman) was appointed as
a director of
the first cross-defendant on 29 May 1998. On 12 February 1999 he was appointed
as a director of the cross-claimant
and held that position until 13 April 1999.

<P>

5   	It is alleged in the amended cross-claim that on or about
12 January1999 Ferrier, on behalf of the first cross-defendant, made
certain
representations to the directors of the cross-claimant concerning a software
package called "The MFX 2000 Software". It is
alleged in the amended
cross-claim that the representations were made at various times during the
relationship namely (using the
titles in the cross-claim): 
<P>

Initial Approach 
<P>

1. 	By Ferrier on behalf of the first cross-defendant; 
<P>

2. 	By Carr on behalf of the first cross-defendant. 
<P>

The Co-operation Agreement
<P>

	By Ferrier on behalf of the first cross-defendant (co-operation and support)

<P>

Retainer of Hatton and initial advice
<P>

By Carr on behalf of the first cross-defendant. 
<P>

6   	Subsequently, as a result of the representations made on
behalf of the first cross-defendant the cross-claimant entered into
heads of
agreement and, as a result of the due diligence reports, entered into an
agreement with the first cross-claimant entitled
"Subscription and Funding
Agreement". This agreement, in essence, appears to provide for certain funding
to be provided by the cross-claimant
to the first cross-defendant and for the
cross-claimant to receive shares in the first cross-defendant. The
cross-claimant advanced
moneys to the first cross-defendant. 
<P>

7   	In the first half of March the due diligence exercise was
commenced. During this period Carr, on behalf of the first cross-defendant,
appointed Leigh Coleman as a consultant of the first cross-defendant for the
purpose of sales of MFX 2000. Coleman advised Carr that
there was the potential
for substantial sales in China. Whilst Ferrier and Freeman responded to
questionnaires from the cross-claimant,
Carr declined to respond. During the
second half of March, problems started to arise in relation to MFX 2000. It is
alleged that
there was a withdrawal of co-operation by the first
cross-defendant.
<P>

8   	It is alleged that on 11 April 1999 Coleman, as agent for
the first cross-defendant, executed a contract with Taiyuan of China
in
relation to MFX 2000. On 13 April 1999 Ferrier and Freeman were advised that
the cross-claimant would not advance $1 million and
were not prepared to
negotiate the $2 million already invested. The cross-claimant was not aware of
the Taiyuan contract. On 13 April
1999 the first defendant issued a notice of
default pursuant to the subscription and funding agreement. 
<P>

9   	Part 8 rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules provides as
follows:
<P>

9.	Where a party 
<P>

(a)	has been improperly or unnecessarily joined; or
<P>

(b)	ceased to be a proper or necessary party, 
<P>

the Court, on application of any party or of its own motion, may order that he
cease to be a party and make order for the further
conduct of proceedings. 
<P>

10   	A party may be removed from proceedings where there is
evidence that the party should not have been joined in the proceedings.
If the
question of joinder is related to substantive issues of law that are fairly
arguable then the proceedings should not be dismissed
or stayed on the ground
of misjoinder or non-joinder of parties: <i>Uniting Church in Australia
Property Trust (New South Wales) v Momsen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 575</a>, at 585. 
<P>

11   	Part 13 rule 5 provides as follows:
<P>

(1)	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relations to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim
for relief in the proceedings

<P>

(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;
<P>

(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or
<P>

(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of process of the Court,
<P>

the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or in
relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.
<P>

(2)	The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application on the
hearing of an application for an order under subrule
(1). 
<P>

12   	This rule gives a discretionary power where a plaintiff's
case is so weak that to commit the proceedings to go trial would
be futile:
<i>Peter Kemp Development v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited</i>
(Unreported, 16 May 1980, Hunt J). 
<P>

13   	In <i>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for
Railways of New South Wales</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%2d1965%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964-1965) 112 CLR 125</a>, at 129 Barwick CJ,
stated as follows:
<P>

"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the view
that a plaintiff ought not be denied access to the
customary tribunal which
deals with actions of the kind he brings unless his lack of cause of action -
if that be the ground if the
court is invited, as in this case, to exercise its
powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated. The test to be applied
has variously expressed; "so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly
succeed", "manifestly groundless", "so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit
an argument", "discloses a case which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed";
under no possibility can it
be a good cause of action"; "be manifest that to
allow them" (the pleadings) "to stand would involve useless expense"."
<P>

14   	Part 15 rule 26 of the Supreme Court Rules provides as
follows
<P>

(1)	Where a pleading 
<P>

(a)	discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the pleading;
<P>

(b) 	has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings, or
<P>

(c)	is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,
<P>

the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the whole
or any part of the pleadings be struck out.
<P>

(2)	The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an
order under subrule (1).
<P>

15   	Ordinarily the power to strike out pleadings as disclosing
no reasonable cause of action should only be exercised in plain
and obvious
cases: <i>General Steels </i>(supra). If the defect in the pleading can be
cured by amendment, then leave to amend ought to be given: <i>Wentworth v
Rogers (No. 5)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%206%20NSWLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 6 NSWLR 534</a> at 536.
<P>

16   	Paragraphs 1 to 29 of the amended cross-claim deal with
the relationship of the cross-claimant and the cross-defendant up
to 12
February 1999. It is alleged in paragraphs 9, 11 and 14 that certain
representations were made on behalf of the first cross-defendant.
Those
representations, it is alleged, were made by Ferrier (paragraphs 9 and 14) and
Carr (paragraph 11). Nowhere in the pleadings
is there an allegation that
Friedman made representations either on his own behalf or on behalf of the
first cross-defendant. By
reason of those matters pleaded in paragraphs 1 to
29, paragraph 30 alleges that Friedman owed fiduciary obligations to the
cross-claimant.
Similarly, with Carr and Ferrier it is said that they both owed
the cross-claimant a fiduciary obligation. The obligation was characterised
in
paragraph 30 of the amended statement of claim. 
<P>

17   	A fiduciary obligation will arise where a person is placed
in a position where he must first and foremost have bound himself
in some way
to protect or advance the interests of another. It is submitted on behalf of
the cross-defendants that no such relationship
existed between the
cross-claimant and the second an third cross-defendants. That, at best, if
there was any fiduciary relationship
it was between the cross-claimant and the
first cross-defendant. The amended cross-claim, as pleaded, alleges that Carr
and Ferrier
on behalf of the first cross-claimant made representations; not
that they made representations in their own right. 
<P>

18   	The cross-claimant relies on a number of authorities to
support the submission that a fiduciary duty was owed by the second
to fourth
cross-defendants to the cross-claimant. Whilst the readily identifiable
relationships which have been established as being
fiduciary in nature, in
<i>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985)
156 CLR 441</a>, at 468 per the Chief Justice and Mason J at 496 - 497 explained
that the category of fiduciary relationships is not closed. In <i>Breen v
Williams </i>(1996) 186 CLR 71, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said,
<P>

"Australian courts have consciously refrained from attempting to provide a
general test for determining one person's or classes
persons' standard of
fiduciary relationship with another. This is because...a term "fiduciary
relationship" defies definition."
<P>

19   	The cross-claimant relies on an unreported decision of
O'Loughlin J in <i>Xang Du Pty Limited &amp; Ors v Adelaide Investment Corp
(Australia) Pty Limited &amp; Ors</i> (Federal Court, Adelaide, 31 May 1999)
where those principles were applied so as to find a fiduciary relationship
arose between each
of the applicants as intending investors of a development
project on the one hand and each of the respondents being the company and
each
of its directors on the other. 
<P>

20   	However, as the pleadings in paragraphs 1 to 29 stand at
the moment it is difficult to establish that a fiduciary relationship
had been
created between the cross-claimant and Friedman. It is not pleaded that
Friedman made any representations, was a party to
any of the representations
that were made or had any knowledge of the representations that were made. 
<P>

21   	In relation to Ferrier and Carr whilst it is pleaded that
certain representations were made by them, it is pleaded that the
representations were made on behalf of the first cross-claimant. In any event
at this stage in the relationship it could be regarded
as being no more than
the preliminary stage of that relationship. What was happening at this point in
time were preliminary negotiations
about the software and the cross-claimant's
possible involvement in the first cross-defendant. 
<P>

22   	However, having regard to <i>General Steels</i> and
<i>Xiang Du Pty Ltd</i> I am of the opinion that the cross-defendants have not
been able to reach the benchmark in that decision which would enable me to
summarily dismiss that part of the amended cross-claim. 
<P>

23   	Whilst as against Friedman it would appear as the matter
is pleaded, at the moment there is no basis for making the allegation
that
there was a fiduciary relationship with the cross-claimant, that does not seem
to be the same position as with Ferrier and Carr.
However, having regard to the
open nature of fiduciary relationships it seems to me that it is not
appropriate to summarily dismiss
that part of the statement of claim pleaded in
paragraphs 1 to 29. The cross-claimant should be given the opportunity to amend
those
parts of the amended cross-claim which do not, at this stage, disclose a
reasonable cause of action. 
<P>

24   	Therefore, as against Ferrier, Carr and Friedman, I strike
out paragraph 29 and paragraph 30 of the amended statement of claim.
Leave is
granted, however, to the cross-claimant to amend those two paragraphs together
with paragraphs 7c, 9 and 11. 
<P>

25   	In relation to paragraphs 59 to 62 (misleading and
deceptive conduct allegations) the cross-claimant is prepared to make
amendments
to paragraphs 59 and 61. The proposed amendments are set out in
paragraphs 4 and 5 of supplementary submissions of the cross-claim.
The
pleadings should also be amended to assert that both Friedman and Ferrier knew
what Carr was doing and were aware of the Taiyuan
contract. 
<P>

26   	A concession was made in relation to paragraph 61 by the
cross-claimant that there should be an amendment to that paragraph
to make a
clear distinction between the claim as against the first cross-defendant under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> </i> and the claim against the second
to fourth cross-defendants under section 42 of the <i>Fair Trading Act.</i> It
was also conceded that the reference to section 51AB of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a></i> such reference should be deleted and any paragraph be amended. 
<P>

27   	In my view having regard to the fact that both Ferrier and
Friedman were directors of the cross-claimant at this stage and
that Carr on
the existing pleadings has refused to complete the due diligence questionnaire
and had entered into discussions with
Coleman on the Taiyuan contract. It can
be asserted that each of those cross-defendants must or ought to have known of
the existence
of the disabling circumstance that is, the withdrawal of
co-operation, non-disclosure of the true state of development and the existence
of the Taiyuan contract had and its effect on the affected party: <i>Commercial
Bank of Australia v Amadio </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 447</a> and 462.
<P>

28   	The amendments should comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 7</a> and
should be supplemented with particulars.
<P>

29   	In relation to paragraph 67 of the amended cross-claim
(the fiduciary duty) that paragraph relates to non-disclosure and the
existence
of the Taiyuan contract by all of the cross-defendants. This is a period of
time after 12 February 1999 when both Ferrier
and Friedman were directors of
the cross-claimant. In adopting the approach in <i>Xang Du Pty Limited
</i>(supra) I am of the view that it is arguable that having regard to the
matrix of facts that there may have been a fiduciary relationship
between the
cross-claimant and Carr and of course there certainly was a fiduciary
relationship between Ferrier and Friedman, both
of whom were directors of the
cross-claimant at this time. 
<P>

30   	However, the difficulty here is that in paragraph 67 the
representations are the representations as defined in paragraph 11.
It seems to
me that paragraphs 67 needs to be repleaded certainly so far as Friedman is
concerned and probably in relation to Ferrier.
Once again in relation to both
of those cross-defendants, there is no allegation that any of the
representations were made in their
capacity as directors or concerning their
knowledge of either the development program or the Taiyuan contract.
<P>

31   	Similarly in paragraph 70 the material facts should be
pleaded and particulars supplied.
<P>

32   	The cross-defendants rely in part on the decision of
<i>Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Limited &amp; ors v TNT Australia Pty
Limited </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/1758.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 1758</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20ATPR%2041%2d522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] ATPR 41-522.</a> In that matter Burchett J set out what is
required in a statement of claim. He said the primary function "is to tell the
defending
party what the claim is that he has to meet. That is a matter of
elementary and natural justice. The claim cannot be answered until
it is
known". His Honour continued "in order to achieve these fundamentals, a
statement of claim must set out clearly, not just the
bare claim that is made
but also the material facts on which it is based, including facts that, if not
specifically pleaded, might
take the other party by surprise". 
<P>

33   	In my view, applying his Honour's comments to the amended
cross-claim in these proceedings, it can be seen that there are
some
deficiencies which may not be able to assist the cross-defendants in
formulating a defence. Therefore, the amended cross-claim
should be subject to
further amendments. I do not think that it is appropriate that the amended
cross-claim be summarily dismissed
as against Ferrier, Carr and Friedman. In
that regard paragraphs 30, 59 to 62, 67 and 69 to 71, should be struck out and
the cross-claimant
should have the opportunity to replead them. 
<P>

34   	The orders that I make are as follows
<P>

1.	In relation to the notice of motion by the fourth cross-claimant: paragraph
1 dismissed; paragraph 2 strike out the following
paragraphs of the amended
cross-claim: 29, 30, 59 to 62, 67, 70 and 71; paragraph 3 dismissed. 
<P>

2.	Liberty granted to the cross-claimant to file and serve a further amended
cross-claim within 14 days from the date hereof. 
<P>

3.	Cross-claimant to pay the fourth cross-defendant's costs of the motion. 
<P>

4.	In relation to the motion brought by the second and third cross-claimants
make order in accordance with paragraph 1 in the notice
of motion except in
relation to paragraphs 59 to 62 so far as they apply to Carr.
<P>

5.	The cross claimant have leave to file and serve a further amended
cross-claim within 14 days from the date hereof. 
<P>

6.	The cross-claimant to pay the second and third cross-defendants' costs of
the motion.
