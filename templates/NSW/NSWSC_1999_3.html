<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>These proceedings relate to shop premises on the Kiama
Harbour Wharf which the defendants have subleased from the plaintiffs.
<P>

2	     The plaintiffs make many claims in the proceedings relating to
allegations that the defendants have engaged in unfair conduct
in trade, and
they also claim to establish that there have been breaches of covenants of the
sublease, and attack the defendants'
entitlement to continue in possession.
The proceedings went to trial before Young J, who reserved judgment on 2
December 1998 and
has not yet determined the matter.
<P>

3	     The defendants apply by notice of motion dated 24 December 1998, but not
actually filed until today, for orders which would
overcome some conduct of the
plaintiffs in the period since judgment was reserved.  Their claim is that the
plaintiffs changed the
locks on the defendants' shop premises and should
restore the keys and should be restrained by injunction from changing the locks
again or interfering with quiet enjoyment.
<P>

4	     The application came before the court in circumstances of great urgency
on 24 December and again on 29 December. Consent
orders were made with effect
for a short time, which required the plaintiffs to restore the keys and
restrained them from changing
the locks or interfering with quiet enjoyment,
and after further adjournment on 29 December those arrangements have effect
until
today only.
<P>

5	     The defendants' counsel's position is that the restraints in orders 2
and 3, that is the injunction, should be continued
in effect until judgment is
given by Young J, and he continues to offer the usual undertaking as to damages
upon which the earlier
orders were based.
<P>

6	     The plaintiffs' solicitor's position, however, is that I should hear the
notice of motion at length during vacation and should
now give directions to
bring that about.
<P>

7	     The defendants' prima facie position in support of their having the
interlocutory relief claimed is very strong.  An interlocutory
arrangement was
made, recorded in a form of memorandum of agreement, during proceedings before
Cohen J on 6 and 7 October 1998, which
regulated what the parties were to do
about possession pending decision of the case, on a basis which clearly shows
that both parties
were to continue in occupation of their then premises.
<P>

8	     The effect of what the defendants ask is that that arrangement should
continue until judgment is given.  The plaintiffs'
position, however, is that
since judgment was  reserved there have been further events constituting
further breaches of covenant.
<P>

9	     Those events, while different in time to events complained of before
Young J, are, I think it is fair to say, of much the
same kind as events and
conduct submitted for adjudication to his Honour.
<P>

10	     A further matter which the plaintiffs' solicitor tells me he also
wishes to rely on is the illegality which he contends
the sublease is subject
to, having regard to s 226 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913, which,
except in limited and irrelevant
cases, forbade subleases.  However, there is
no evidence and there is no sign of any adverse action by the Crown threatening
the
lease or the sublease or relying on any supposed illegality.
<P>

11	     In the absence of any threat to the right of possession of either party
from the Crown, which is the party protected by
s 226, I do not think that the
question whether or not the sublease is affected by illegality has such urgency
as to justify addressing
it fully during vacation.  Indeed, not only is it
appropriate that the arrangement which existed as of the time when judgment was
reserved should continue during vacation;  it appears to me on the material
before me now that it should continue until Young J gives
judgment.
<P>

12	     The continuation of what the plaintiffs say are events which constitute
breaches of covenants since judgment was reserved,
after many months in which
the parties have been in conflict and at law against each other, does not seem
to me to constitute a reason
for treating the matter as urgent or giving it an
urgent hearing, or for doing anything else but accepting that the existing
position
when judgment was reserved should be continued.
<P>

13	     If in the future it becomes known that the defendants were not entitled
to possession, and that the plaintiffs were right
to lock them out, no doubt
remedies will be available.
<P>

14	     The parties are enmeshed in their lawsuit and must be held at a stand
until a determination of rights is available.
<P>

15	     The order is:  Orders 3 and 4 of 24 December 1998 are continued in
effect upon the defendants' previous undertaking until
final determination of
these proceedings or earlier further order.
<P>

16	     The defendants' costs of the notice of motion of 24 December 1998 are
defendants' costs in the proceedings.
<P>

17	(Mr Knaggs sought leave to apply, if not during vacation, during
February.)
<P>

18	Each party has leave to apply on two days' notice.
<P>

                                    I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-18 are
the reasons for
<P>

                                                  judgment of the Honourable
Justice John Bryson.
<P>

                                                   Dated 28 January 1999.    (H
D LEWIS)
