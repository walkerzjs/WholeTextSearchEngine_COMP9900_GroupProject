<i>Wednesday, 28 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4568/98	THREE DIMENSION INVESTMENTS PTY LIMITED    -v-    LIEU INVESTMENTS
PTY LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>By summons filed on 9 November 1998 the
plaintiff, Three Dimension Investments Pty Ltd., seeks an order setting aside a
statutory
demand served upon it by the defendant, Lieu Investments Pty Ltd (In
Liquidation).
<P>

2   	That demand is dated 9 October 1998.  It seeks payment by
the plaintiff to the defendant of an amount of $103,855, which amount
is
described in the schedule to the demand as "inter company loans due and payable
27 October 1997".  The summons was returnable
before the Registrar on 8
December 1998.  It was adjourned on a number of occasions before the Registrar
and various orders and directions
were made for the filing of affidavits.  
<P>

3   	It came before me for hearing on 19 March 1999. On that
occasion the plaintiff sought an adjournment; the basis for the adjournment
application was to enable the plaintiff to file further affidavit evidence.
<P>

4   	In the face of opposition by the defendant I acceded to the
application for adjournment and vacated the hearing date of 19
March 1999.  I
specially fixed the hearing before myself for this day, 28 April 1999.  I made
consequential costs orders in favour
of the defendant.  I also ordered that any
further affidavits upon which the plaintiff might wish to rely be served on or
before
7 April 1999.
<P>

5   	When the matter came on for hearing before me this day the
plaintiff relied upon an affidavit of Anthony Alfred Chung sworn
9 November
1998.  The defendant objected to paragraphs 2 and 3 of that affidavit.  I
rejected each of those paragraphs.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff filed in Court, without objection, an
affidavit of Anthony Alfred Chung sworn 20 April 1999.  The plaintiff sought
then to read that affidavit. The defendant objected to the reading of the
affidavit.  The ground of that objection was that the affidavit
had been served
only on 22 April 1999, that being more than two weeks after the time limited
for the service of such affidavit by
the order of 19 March 1999.  Further, that
when the affidavit was served upon the defendant there were no exhibits to that
affidavit
made available to the defendant and that to the present time no such
exhibits have been made available to the defendant.
<P>

7   	No adequate explanation was offered for the contravention
by the plaintiff of the order made on 19 March concerning the service
of any
further affidavits.  The only suggested explanation was that there had been
some settlement negotiations being conducted between
the plaintiff and the
liquidator of the defendant.  
<P>

8   	I did not regard the conduct of any such settlement
negotiations as being an adequate explanation for the failure of the plaintiff
to serve further affidavit evidence within the time limited, especially since
the basis for the matter being adjourned on 19 March
was to enable the
plaintiff to provide such further affidavit evidence.  
<P>

9   	The plaintiff then sought to adduce oral evidence from Mr
Chung. That course was opposed by the defendant, and I refused to
allow such
oral evidence to be given at the hearing where the plaintiff had not provided,
in accordance with the order of 19 March,
affidavit evidence. 
<P>

10   	The plaintiff then sought an adjournment of today's
hearing. The ground upon which the adjournment was sought was to enable
the
plaintiff to provide further affidavit evidence.  Since that was the very
ground upon which the adjournment of 19 March was granted
six weeks ago; and
since, for practical purposes, the plaintiff had done nothing in the
intervening period, apart from, more than
two weeks after the time so limited,
had served an affidavit without making available annexures; and since the
defendant opposed
any such adjournment, I refused the application for
adjournment.
<P>

11   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that
there is a genuine dispute as to the amount claimed.  However, at the
outset of
the hearing Counsel for the plaintiff stated that the amounts which make up the
debt claimed by the defendant were not
in fact in dispute, but that the
plaintiff asserted a set-off exceeding the amount of the claim in the statutory
demand.  There is
no evidence before the Court supporting the existence of such
a set-off. 
<P>

12   	It was also stated by Counsel for the plaintiff that the
plaintiff was solvent. There is no evidence before the Court asserting
or
supporting such solvency.
<P>

13   	There is a public interest in matters relating to
companies and the service of statutory demands upon them.  Further, the
conduct
of the plaintiff in these proceedings and the various applications by the
plaintiff for adjournments and the total disregard
by the plaintiff of the very
basis upon which the contested adjournment was granted on 19 March 1999 would
make a mockery of the
proceedings in the Court if I were to allow the matter
further to be adjourned.
<P>

14   	There is no evidence before the Court to support the
assertion that there is a dispute, let alone a genuine dispute, as to
the
amount claimed in the statutory demand.  There is no evidence before the Court
as to the existence of any set-off in favour of
the plaintiff equal to or
exceeding the amount of the demand.
<P>

15   	Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the summons.  I make the
following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.
<P>
