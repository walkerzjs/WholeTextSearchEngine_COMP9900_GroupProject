<P>

<b>			&amp; ANOR (No 2)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Personal injury - Liability, cross claims,</b>
<P>

<b>  damages)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff brings these proceedings for
damages for personal injury sustained by him on 24 December 1992 when he fell
through
a ceiling.  He alleges that his injuries were caused by the negligence
of Astra Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited (Astra), the first defendant
and Rondal
Pty Limited (Rondal), the second defendant.  It is alleged that the first
defendant is the occupier of the premises located
in 10 Khartoum Road North
Ryde (the premises) where the accident occurred.  The second defendant was a
construction company carrying
out building work at the said premises. 
<P>

2  	The plaintiff was born on 11 October 1955 and was 37 years of age
at the time of the accident.  In 1972 he left school after
completing the
school certificate and commenced as an apprentice electrician with DFG
Electrical.  The apprenticeship took four years
and the plaintiff completed it
in 1976.  In 1977 the plaintiff commenced work with Works Ayr Electric as a
tradesman electrician.
 Between 1978 and 1981 the plaintiff worked together
with a partner in a business called Mains Electrical.  In 1981 the plaintiff
commenced business in his own right and subsequently the business was
incorporated to Inco Electrical Pty Limited.  The plaintiff
was its only full
time employee but at times up to 19 casual staff were employed.  The plaintiff
has been married twice and has three
children.  He is currently not married.
<P>

3  	On the date of the accident, namely 24 December 1992, the
plaintiff was employed by Inco Electrical Pty Limited (Inco) (the
first cross
defendant to the first cross claimant and the cross defendant to the second
cross claimant).  The plaintiff was performing
electrical work at the premises
pursuant to an agreement between the second defendant and the plaintiff's
employer Inco.  There was
no written contract between those parties.  The
defendants deny liability and allege that if liability against them is
established
the damages to which the plaintiff would otherwise have been
entitled ought to be reduced by reason of the plaintiff's own contributory
negligence.  
<P>

4  	By amended cross claim filed 8 August 1996 Astra seeks
contribution towards an indemnity against Inco (first cross defendant
to first
cross claim) and Rondal (second cross defendant to first cross claim).  By
second cross claim, Rondal seeks contribution
and/or indemnity from Inco.  By
third cross claim Rondal seeks contribution and/or indemnity from Astra.  
<P>

5  	Astra is a pharmaceutical company which makes amongst other
things sterilised plastic ampoules.  Some areas of the premises
have to be kept
sterile and some of the rooms have to remain sealed.  In some areas there was a
series of air locks where air could
only flow out of the sterilised area and
not flow back in.  For each of seven years prior to the accident Inco carried
out work at
the first defendant's premises during the three weeks when the
premises were closed.  This was known as the Christmas break shut
down.  During
these periods of work up to 80 men would be employed to carry out the
renovations - gyprockers, carpenters, electricians
etc.  The plaintiff had at
times in the previous years worked up to 24 hours per day.  
<P>

6  	In 1992, 90 per cent of Inco's work was with Rondal.  Rondal
carried out the building work which usually consisted of moving
walls and
partitions, pulling down ceilings and replacing them at various locations
within the premises.  In previous years Inco
also carried out regular
maintenance work for Astra.  Inco was paid directly by Astra for that work.  On
25 November 1992 Rondal
submitted a quotation to Astra in relation to the
building alterations to their premises during the December 1992/January 1993
shut
down.  Paragraph (B) of the quotation referred to the location known as
the new Rommelag corridor.  The proposed work included air
conditioning, new
electric swing doors and a glass wall.  The quote for this part of the work was
$103,700 (Ex 1D/2).  I infer that
this quote is the basis upon which Rondal
undertook the work for Astra.  
<P>

7  	Rondal instructed Inco to carry out the electrical work in the
Rommelag Area which included the corridor.  A Rommelag machine
is a plastic
injection machine.  It is about half the size of a courtroom.  It was not
disputed that Inco was an independent contractor.
 Inco sent two invoices dated
26 December 1992 to Rondal in relation to the work carried out between 20-24
December 1992 in the sum
of $990.11 and $318.88 (Ex 1D/2) respectively. 
<P>

8  	It is convenient at this stage that I make some comments
concerning the plaintiff's demeanour.  I carefully observed the plaintiff
while
he was giving evidence and being cross examined.  He was articulate, confident
and well presented.  It is my view that his
evidence was largely truthful.
However, I formed the view that he presented his case at its highest.  There
were some inconsistencies
between the evidence he gave and the statements he
made to an investigator on 26 February 1993 (Ex B) which I will refer in more
detail later in this judgment.
<P>

<b><u>The accident</u></b>
<P>

9  	During the 1992 Christmas shutdown the pace of work was more
relaxed than in previous years.  The plaintiff was required to
work only 10 to
12 hours per day.  Inco employed only five other casual employees to assist the
plaintiff to carry out the electrical
work at the premises during this
period.
<P>

10  	As at 24 December 1992 the plaintiff had already been working at
the premises for about one week.  During that time the Rommelag
area had been
altered.  There were no formal plans detailing the proposed alterations.  The
walls had been removed and had been replaced
in a different position.
<P>

11  	The portion of ceiling that collapsed had already been altered
during this shutdown because there was a higher ceiling level
than in the rest
of the factory and there was also a little dwarf wall in the vicinity (t 95).
The air conditioning unit had been
hoisted up into the ceiling cavity.  The
marine plywood sheets in the ceiling had been removed and had not been
replaced.  The original
timber from the earlier ceiling had been reinstalled (t
74.35).  The gyprock ceiling had been replaced. At the premises there were
a
number of fluorescent lights which were affixed to the ceiling by pieces of
wood which were near the joists (t 21).  A large timber
joist had been
installed.  
<P>

12  	The ceiling comprised of joists which ran from one supporting
wall to another in a parallel fashion.  The joists at their edge
had dimensions
of 100 millimetres (height) and 50 millimetres (width).  There were smaller
pieces of timber placed at right angles
to the joists called trimmers or
noggings (I shall refer to them as trimmers).  They were 100 x 50 millimetres
and usually smaller
in length than joists.  The trimmers were fixed by two or
three  75 millimetre nails being hammered through the joists into the butt
end
of each trimmer at the side.  Joists are considered structural members of the
roof whereas trimmers are not considered as such.

<P>

13  	In previous years marine plywood sheets were laid over the
joists and framework of the ceiling to spread the load.  The laying
down of
plywood sheets meant that the inside of the ceiling was like a floor where
tradesmen could walk around and position themselves
on these plywood sheets to
carry out work in the ceiling.
<P>

14  	Phillip Thomas Richard Baldwin, a carpenter employed with Rondal
at the time of the plaintiff's accident, gave evidence.  He
had been employed
as a carpenter for about 15 years.  He had previously worked at the premises
for two or three Christmas shutdowns
and explained that if joists obstructed
the position where the air conditioning and lighting were to be installed the
ceiling joist
would be cut (t 82).  The trimmers would then go across at 90
degrees to the joist that was cut to the next parallel joist.  The
cut joist
would not be as strong as it was originally when it was supported by the wall.
Mr Baldwin also gave evidence that if the
air conditioning ceiling duct was
only 12 inches square and the joists were 600 millimetres apart at the centre
it would probably
not be necessary to make any cuts in the joist on the
assumption that the air conditioning duct could be put through the centre of
the joist.
<P>

15  	The plaintiff was working in the ceiling space in the Rommelag
machine area.  On the day of the accident he had been working
in that location
for a couple of hours.  He had walked over the ceiling space in the general
area where the accident occurred about
five times.  There was room for the
plaintiff to stand between the ceiling and the roof.  The ceiling space was
very confined.  Movements
were restricted by lots of machinery, service lines
and air conditioning ducts.  It was a cramped, crowded and hot area to work in
(t 103).  There was a hole in the ceiling to accommodate the light fittings but
the light fittings had not been affixed (t 49.25).

<P>

16  	The plaintiff was trying to feed a computer cable around an air
conditioning duct.  The air conditioning duct was about 12
inches square and in
length went from the floor up through the ceiling.  He was in what he described
as a lying position where he
was kneeling down on one knee but standing up on
one foot (t 8.15).  No evidence was given of the plaintiff's actual weight at
the
time of the accident but he weighed somewhere between 65 to 95 kilograms.
He was 183 centimetres tall.  The plaintiff gave evidence
that he was
positioned on a timber joist which held the ceiling up (t 8.20).  His left foot
and his right knee were placed on the
one piece of timber (t 52.40-50).  I
shall return to the issue as to what structure the plaintiff had placed his
feet upon shortly.
 Both his arms were outstretched as he was reaching behind
the air conditioning duct which was positioned very close to the edge
of a
wall.  His face was almost touching the air conditioning duct.  
<P>

17  	He had pulled about 10 metres of a 20 metre computer cable
around the air conditioning duct.  The next thing he remembered
was being on
the floor and looking back up at the ceiling.  He had not felt any pre-movement
of the timbers prior to his fall.  He
fell four metres onto the concrete floor.
After the fall, the plaintiff observed that the section of the ceiling was no
longer there
and that there was a piece of timber hanging down and one piece of
timber near his face.  
<P>

18  	It is convenient to refer to the <b><u>Jones v Dunkel</u></b>
submissions at this stage.  The second defendant served an expert engineering
report of Professor Emmerson on the plaintiff two days
prior to the hearing.
The plaintiff's solicitor notified Professor Emmerson that he was required for
cross examination.  During the
luncheon adjournment on the second day of this
hearing, the second defendant's legal representatives elected not to rely on
his report
and informed him that he was no longer required.  Professor Emmerson
told the plaintiff's solicitor that he had been released.  The
plaintiff's
solicitor did not request Professor Emmerson to stay as he was required by the
plaintiff.  The plaintiff submitted that
I should draw a <b><u>Jones v
Dunkel</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298</a> inference that the engineering report was not
of assistance to the second defendant's case.  
<P>

19  	As Mahoney J stated in <b><u>Fabre v Arenales</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27
NSWLR 437</a> the <b><u>Jones v Dunkel</u></b> principle is not concerned with
whether a particular inference of fact can be drawn.  It is concerned with
whether it should be drawn
in a particular case.  As the plaintiff's legal
representatives had the opportunity to call Professor Emmerson to give evidence
and
did not avail themselves of it, I do not think that a <b><u>Jones v
Dunkel</u></b> inference should be drawn in relation to the report of Professor
Emmerson.  Further the second defendant sought to tender Professor
Emmerson's
report.  It was disallowed and not admitted into evidence on the basis that
Professor Emmerson was required for cross
examination and was unavailable.  
<P>

20  	Only the plaintiff and Mr Baldwin gave an account of the
accident.  The plaintiff also submitted that as the defendants did
not call any
witnesses at all, <b><u>Jones v Dunkel</u></b> inferences arose.  It was put to
the plaintiff that he had conversations with two employees of the second
defendant after the accident.
 Those witnesses were not called.  The plaintiff
could not recall those conversations.  I do not think it is appropriate to draw
a <b><u>Jones v Dunkel</u></b> inference in relation to those witnesses who
allegedly had conversations with the plaintiff.  
<P>

21  	The tradesman who constructed the area where the plaintiff fell
in the first place was not called nor was the tradesman who
fixed the ceiling
after the accident.  The tradesman who repaired the area afterwards would have
been able to give evidence as to
whether trimmers or a joist had to be replaced
and what the ceiling looked like after the accident.  He was not called.  There
was
no attempt to explain the failure to call those witnesses.  According to
the plaintiff a <b><u>Jones v Dunkel</u></b> inference therefore arises and
this inference applies equally to the second defendant's case.
<P>

22  	There was no explanation by the second defendant as to why it
did not call two witnesses who could have given evidence as to
the quality of
the workmanship relating to nailing of the trimmers to the joists  and which
timbers had to be replaced and what sort
and numbers of timbers that were on
the ground and remained hanging from the ceiling.  I draw an inference that
this uncalled evidence
would not have assisted the second defendant's case.  I
do not draw this inference against the first defendant as the first defendant
would not have been expected to call these witnesses.
<P>

<b><u>Was the plaintiff positioned on one or two trimmers or on a
joist</u>?</b>
<P>

23  	The plaintiff gave evidence that he is almost certain that he
was kneeling on a joist (t 33).  By that he means that he was
kneeling on a
major structural member of the ceiling.  In cross examination the plaintiff was
asked many questions about a statement
he had made in February 1993 (Ex B) to
an investigator.  At paragraph 62 of that statement he said that he presumed he
had been kneeling
on timber work but possibly a section of unsupported timber
which was used as support for either lighting or air conditioning installation.
During cross examination the plaintiff denied that he had been kneeling on a
piece of unsupported timber.  However he conceded that
he may have been
kneeling a piece of trimmer that was nailed in over the top of the joists and
supporting the air conditioning duct
and that it was a possibility that he
could have put his weight on a piece of unsupported timber chosen to support
the light fitting.
<P>

24  	The plaintiff cannot remember how many trimmers were resting on
top of the joists in the vicinity of the air conditioning duct.
 He conceded
that it was possible that one of the pieces of timber that were nailed into
position around the lighting and ducting
might have given way and that is what
he was seeking to convey when he made the above statement to the investigator
(t 35.48).  However
he very much doubted that it was one of those timbers
designed only to support lighting or air conditioning ducting that might have
given way.  
<P>

25  	Later, the plaintiff agreed that what he was saying in February
1993 was that he believed that he was kneeling on timber work
and possibly a
section of unsupported timber (t 36.55).  By "unsupported" he meant that it was
not supported by a brick or timber
wall but rather it was supported by another
timber.  The plaintiff agreed that a timber supporting the lighting was more
likely to
give way but did not concede that the timber surrounding the ducting
was more likely to give way (t 38.35).  The plaintiff also agreed
that he
should not put his weight on an unsupported timber such as one chosen to
support lighting.  He remembered the ceiling perfectly
and knew that there was
a "four by two" nailed in front of the air conditioning unit and he knew where
his weight was positioned.
<P>

26  	Mr Baldwin was working between six to ten feet away but around a
corner when the plaintiff fell. He did not see the accident
occur but heard a
yell, a crash and someone cry out in pain.  He made his way to the source of
the noise.  According to his recollection
the gyprock had been freshly painted
but it had broken away and either one or two timbers actually skewed out of the
ceiling (t 84.20).
 He identified the timbers as being ceiling joists, possibly
oregon.  On further questioning Mr Baldwin stated that he could not
recall
whether they were joists, full joists or trimmers but he did not see any broken
timber (t 84.30).  Nor did he recall seeing
any timber on the ground.  
<P>

27  	Mr Baldwin said that it was obvious to him that after the fall
one or probably two trimmers had been dislodged (t 98.48) and
that the
plaintiff had applied all of his weight to one or two trimmers and perhaps had
applied some force to try and get around
the duct when the trimmers came apart
and he fell through the ceiling.  When asked if there was any possibility that
any joist had
come down, Mr Baldwin replied "No, this was - they certainly were
not the long original ceiling joist."  (t 98.53)  Mr Baldwin said
that if a
joist had come down then the whole ceiling or a long portion of it would have
come down (t 98.57;  t 99.1).  Overall he
thought it was a trimmer.  He could
not remember if it was one or two trimmers which had come down.  
<P>

28  	In cross examination Mr Baldwin said that the obvious cause of
the accident was that the pieces of timber had not been nailed
together
properly (t 92.52) and the strength of the timber was only as strong as the
quality of the nailing.  But he agreed that
even if a light man such as himself
had put his weight on a trimmer even if nailed correctly it would involve the
risks of the trimmer
collapsing (t 95.45).  So Mr Baldwin has given two
opinions as to the cause of the accident.
<P>

29  	From the conflicting evidence of the plaintiff and Mr Baldwin, I
have reached the following conclusions.  On a number of occasions
the plaintiff
referred to having his left foot and right knee placed on the one piece of
timber.  He was almost certain that he was
kneeling on a joist or a "four by
two" nailed in front of the air conditioning timber but it was possible that he
could have been
kneeling possibly on a section of unsupported timber such as
one chosen to support lighting.  If the plaintiff by referring to a
4" x 2"
meant he was kneeling on a joist it would not normally be nailed yet he
referred to that being so.  A possible but unlikely
explanation is that he was
kneeling on a shortened joist.  Mr Baldwin did not see how the plaintiff was
positioned prior to the accident.
<P>

30  	It is unlikely that a joist had been shortened as the air
conditioning ceiling duct was 12 inches square (30 millimetres) and
the joists
were 600 millimetres apart.  There was ample room to fit the air conditioning
duct which was located very close to the
edge of a wall between two joists.
There was at least one piece of timber left hanging from the ceiling and I
accept the plaintiff's
evidence that there was also a piece of timber near his
face.  It is my view that it is more likely than not, on the balance of
probabilities,
that the plaintiff had his left foot and right knee on one
trimmer which had been nailed in over the top of joists directly in front
of
the air conditioning unit.
<P>

<b><u>What was the cause of the accident?</u></b>
<P>

31  	The plaintiff does not know what caused him to fall.  The
plaintiff had positioned himself precariously as he was kneeling
on his right
knee which meant that his right foot was unsupported.  He did not give evidence
that his right foot was resting on another
trimmer or joist.  His left foot and
right knee were on the same trimmer directly in front of the air conditioning
unit.  His arms
were outstretched with his face almost touching the air
conditioning unit.  I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that because
the plaintiff was placed in this awkward position he lost his balance and
fell.
<P>

32  	It is my view that the trimmer collapsed because most if not all
of the plaintiff's weight was placed on one trimmer.  On the
balance of
probabilities I am satisfied that the most likely cause of the trimmer giving
way was because most, if not all of the
plaintiff's weight was placed on it.
When the plaintiff lost his balance and fell the trimmer came away from the
joists during the
fall. Alternatively, due to his awkward positioning on the
trimmer he lost his balance and knocked the trimmer with force and then
fell
causing the unsupported timber around the air conditioning unit to dislodge,
one such piece of timber ending up near the plaintiff's
face.  The piece of
timber that was left hanging from the ceiling could also have been dislodged
during the fall.  Even though the
person who nailed the trimmer on top of the
joist was not called to give evidence I find that the trimmer was not
incorrectly nailed.
 Even if the trimmer was not properly nailed over the top
of the joists, it was the plaintiff's loss of balance that caused the trimmers
dislodge.  If there was any improper nailing, it did not cause or materially
contribute the plaintiff's fall.
<P>

<b><u>The nature of the duty of care owed by the defendants</u></b>
<P>

33  	As the facts earlier recited show, Astra was the occupier of the
premises and Rondal was the building contractor on site. 
Rondal had
sub-contracted the electrical work to Inco.  The plaintiff was the only full
time employee, shareholder and the director
of Inco.  It was stated by Mr
Baldwin that the carpenters were sub-contracted by Rondal.  It is not known on
what basis he formed
the view that the carpenters were sub-contractors and I do
not find that the carpenters were sub-contractors of Rondal.  Further,
the
second defendant did not plead in its defence that the accident was caused by
the negligence of the carpenters nor that the carpenters
were sub-contractors.

<P>

34  	The plaintiff submitted that the defendants owed the plaintiff a
general common law duty of care.  The plaintiff alleged that
the defendants
breached this duty of care in that they failed to warn or adequately warn the
plaintiff of the dangerous nature of
the ceiling framework;  they carried out
alterations to the ceiling framework which made it dangerous;  they removed
solid sheeting
laid over the ceiling framework with a result that the framework
was thereby rendered less stable and more likely to fall and that
there was a
real risk of injury to the plaintiff in permitting him to work in a ceiling
with hidden or unusual dangers.  It is convenient
to state here that the
allegation of negligence in relation to the removal of the solid sheeting
cannot be made out as the plaintiff
gave evidence that he could not use the
plywood sheets even if they had been replaced in the ceiling because if the
flooring was
there he would not be able to put the wires through the joists.
<P>

35  	So far as these particulars relate to fault directly
attributable to Astra or to Rondal they depend upon there having been
a
personal duty of care reposed in them to exercise reasonable care to protect
the plaintiff from foreseeable risk of injury, which
called on them to ensure
that they took adequate precautions for the plaintiff's safety while he carried
out electrical work in the
ceiling and not put him in a position of peril.  It
may be accepted that a risk of injury attaches in respect of any person who had
to go on to a ceiling structure, erected by another, in order to carry out or
complete building work in respect of that structure.
 It follows from the
circumstances that such a person is expected to work at a height, and upon a
structure for the security and
soundness of which he had to rely upon the
second defendant.  
<P>

36  	The scope of that duty of care is determined by reference to the
circumstances, the foreseeability of the risk and the reasonableness
to such a
foreseeable risk.  What is reasonable will vary with the plaintiff's entry upon
the premises.  The defendants are entitled
to take into account that a person
such as the plaintiff who comes onto the premises will take reasonable care for
his own safety.
 In the case of skilled independent contractors who encounter
risks ordinarily incident to the work they are invited onto the premises
to
perform, reasonable men in the position of occupiers would not foresee or if
they did foresee would not think it reasonably necessary
to guard against the
occurrence of those injuries which are ordinary incidents of the work - see

contractors must provide their own safeguards against the normal incidental
risks of their trade (<b><u>Christmas</u></b> at 148). 
<P>

37  	The first defendant was the occupier of the premises and
admitted that it owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.  The first
defendant
engaged a contractor, the second defendant, to carry out the renovation work.
It was the second defendant who was obliged
to provide skill and expertise and
who had control of the work.  The first defendant was entitled to rely on the
second defendant's
knowledge and skill in performance of building work and
management of its employees and contractors.  According to Mr Baldwin, he
was
satisfied that the roof was safe with the carpentry practices being undertaken
by the second defendant (t 91.5).
<P>

38  	Because Rondal had the physical control of the premises, it may
also be accepted that it would have been foreseeable by Rondal
that a
electrician in the position of the plaintiff, would have had to go on to such a
ceiling structure on this construction site
and that a risk of injury would be
attached to such activity, if the roof structure was not sound, or if the areas
upon which the
plaintiff could safely walk were not readily apparent or
discoverable. 
<P>

39  	Because plywood sheets were not there the plaintiff stated that
he took particular care.  He realised that it was incumbent
on him to ensure
the area where he was working was safe (t 68).  He did not observe anything
that would have put him on notice that
there might be some risk to him when he
was working in the ceiling.
<P>

40  	The plaintiff agreed that when an electrician is up in the
ceiling he only puts weight on the structural members.  The plaintiff
admitted
that in the ceiling, in addition to the structural beams, there were pieces of
wood which were nailed between the structural
beams and those cross beams were
to support the lighting or air conditioning ducting (t 23).  He agreed that the
structural strength
of the trimmers was only as good as the strength of the
nails that attached them to the structural members but he held the view that
both the structural members and the trimmers in the Astra ceiling would hold
his weight.  It was his experience of many years that
if a trimmer was put in
place properly it was definitely safe to stand on.  This is at odds with the
opinion of Mr Baldwin who said
that even if a light man such as himself (at 65
kgs) had put his weight on a trimmer even if nailed correctly it would involve
risks
of the trimmer collapsing and it would be a better practice to spread
both feet and hence reduce the risk of falling. 
<P>

41  	The plaintiff had been an electrician for 20 years and had done
electrical work at the first defendant's premises for the previous
7 years
during the Christmas break shutdown.  He was familiar with the premises and
with moving through the ceiling.  The plaintiff
as in previous years was
himself competent to control his system of work without supervision by or
direction from either of the defendants.
 It does not seem to me that either
defendant should have reasonably been required to lay down a system for the
performance by electricians
and other independent contractors of their work in
the ceiling or to supervise the electrician's compliance with any such system.
The accident was caused by the plaintiff placing himself in a precarious
position on one trimmer where he lost his balance and fell.
 He did not take
reasonable care of his own safety and was the author of his own misfortune.  It
is my view that a reasonable man
in either defendants' position would not have
foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to
electricians
carrying out work in the ceiling.  The plaintiff would have been
aware that it was imprudent to place all of his weight on a trimmer.
 It was
not unreasonable to expect that the plaintiff would have become aware that he
had to place himself in a precarious position
on a trimmer, and that he would
need to take steps to avoid that risk such as laying a spare piece of timber
across the ceiling joist
parallel and positioned as close as possible to the
trimmer.  He then would have been able to place some weight on the spare piece
of timber as well as the trimmer next to the air conditioning unit.  This would
have provided a stable work platform to allow the
plaintiff to safely position
himself to carry out the work.  
<P>

42  	I do not regard the ceiling framework as being of an unusual or
hidden danger, nor that the alterations to the ceiling framework
were
dangerous.  It was imprudent of the plaintiff to place all of his weight on one
trimmer.  Once he decided to take this risky
course of action, if he thought
the trimmer was unsafe he could have tested it to see if the trimmer was nailed
in on top of the
joists.  Accordingly the defendants did not have a duty to
warn the plaintiff of the dangerous nature of the framework. 
<P>

43  	There is a verdict and judgment in favour of the defendants.
There will be verdict for the cross defendants on the cross claims.
 As the
defendants have been successful, the plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
As the cross claimants have been unsuccessful
on the cross claims, they are to
pay the cross defendant's costs.
<P>

44  	In case I am found to be in error, I will record my findings as
to the losses sustained by the plaintiff as a direct result
of the accident
which would (upon proof of a breach of duty of care) have been recoverable from
either or both of the defendants.
<P>

45  	It is noted that the plaintiff submitted that the cheap and
practical responses to the foreseeable risk could have been firstly
not to cut
the joists at all;  secondly to leave light fittings as they had been before;
thirdly to use small light fittings between
joists;  fourthly notch in the
trimmers;  fifthly warn the plaintiff either by oral warning, a sign at the
entry points to the ceiling
or other means such as paint or arrows etc not to
stand on particular joists because they had been cut and sixthly to make
available
a piece of timber 100 x 50 which was long enough that could have been
laid across the top of two ceiling joists.  Mr Baldwin was
asked whether the
correct way to redo the ceiling was to lay new ceiling joists rather than cut
joists and trim out.  He agreed that
technically the correct way was to lay new
ceiling joists.  However he conceded that he was satisfied with the
appropriateness of
the carpentry practices undertaken in the ceiling and that
the work completed was safe.
<P>

46  	Mr Baldwin suggested that if there was an area with cuts in the
ceiling joists and trimmers and it was not possible to put
down a plywood
sheet, the area could be made secure by using a piece of timber 100 x 50 which
was long enough to be laid across the
top of the other ceiling joist and wall
or carry out work on that piece of timber.  This would have provided a stable
work platform.
 If either or both of the defendants breached their duty of care
to the plaintiff, they could have instructed the plaintiff to lay
a spare piece
of timber on top of the other ceiling joist next to the trimmer to provide a
stable work platform.  This would be a
cheap and practical response to the
risk.
<P>

<b><u>Plaintiff's injuries and disabilities</u></b>
<P>

47  	When the plaintiff fell he hit his head on a wall.  He hurt
"like hell".  He could not pivot his head, his back was sore and
his right hand
hurt more than his left one.  For the next few days his head, neck and wrists
were very sore.  His back was "murder".
 His head was painful for a short while
after the accident.  The bruising took a short time to go away.  The right
wrist was sore
for a few months but gradually the symptoms in his right wrist
resolved.
<P>

48  	After the accident the plaintiff was taken to hospital and had
x-rays done.  In relation to the cervical spine down to mid
C7, there was no
para vertebral soft tissue swelling seen.  There was a fracture of the scaphoid
with minor separation of the fracture
seen.  There was no fracture to the right
wrist.  He was diagnosed as having sustained a fracture of the left carpal
scaphoid bone
and his left wrist was placed in plaster for a period of two
months.  None of the doctors in the reports tendered disagree with this
diagnosis.  Once the plaster was removed, his left wrist was placed in a
removable splint.  He underwent courses for mobilising and
strengthening
exercises to the left wrist.  
<P>

49  	An x-ray taken 29 December 1992 of the lumbo sacral spine showed
that there was a minor congenital abnormality which was almost
certainly
asymptomatic but there was a minor right sided disc bulge at the L4/5 level and
early degenerative lipping of the right
L5/S1 facet joint.  In 1993 the
plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Ruff, the surgeon who told the plaintiff that he
had no major worries
as a result of the fall on the back and the nerve exit
foramina in between the vertebra were clear despite the disc bulge.  Rest
and
physiotherapy were recommended.
<P>

50  	In mid 1993 the plaintiff was still complaining of swelling and
tenderness at the front of his left wrist and x-rays confirmed
the presence of
a displaced non-united fracture of the scaphoid tubercle.  Dr Herbert's view
was that the problem with the plaintiff's
left wrist was consistent with a
history of injury as given but unfortunately the plaintiff developed an unusual
complication of
non-union through the distal pole of the scaphoid which
required surgery.  This was complicated by the development of a cutaneous
neuroma which may have been responsible for some of the plaintiff's ongoing
symptoms.  Dr Herbert said that the fracture had also
left the plaintiff with
some deformity of the scapho-trapezial joint, which may also be contributing to
his symptoms and increased
the risk of secondary osteoarthritis.  He was of the
view that because of the plaintiff's ongoing symptoms he had been forced to
give up his employment as an electrician and change to clerical work instead.
The plaintiff had an operation on his left wrist. 
After the operation the
plaintiff underwent intense physiotherapy but there was no improvement in the
condition of his wrist although
Dr Herbert noted that he regained virtually a
full range of motion in the wrist.
<P>

51  	The defendant tendered a report of Dr Cummine dated 14 September
1997.  It was his view that the plaintiff appeared to have
sustained a minor
fracture of the left scaphoid and soft tissue injuries to the right wrist, neck
and back.  He was of the opinion
that the non-union of the scaphoid tubercle
would not require surgical intervention and a fibrous non-union would be
compatible with
normal function and that it was unlikely to produce any
significant long term consequences.  However Dr Cummine had not seen the
x-rays
of the plaintiff's wrist and his opinion is at odds with that of Drs Conrad,
Caspary and Herbert.  I prefer the evidence of
the latter doctors.  
<P>

52  	Dr Conrad in his report dated 6 August 1996 stated that on the
left wrist there was a surgical scar over the left scaphoid
on the ventral
surface and a 10% loss of flexion extension and lateral movement.  There was a
weakness of grip of the left hand and
tenderness over the area.  It was Dr
Conrad's view that the plaintiff suffered a back strain associated with mild
bilateral sciatica
and a fracture of the left scaphoid bone in his left wrist.
Dr Conrad found that the plaintiff needed conservative  treatment and
was fit
for light work which did not involve heavy lifting, repetitive bending,
standing or sitting in the one position for any length
of time or heavy
repetitive work with his left wrist.  He did not believe that the plaintiff
could do full on work of a commercial
electrician because of the need to climb
into confined spaces and lift heavy material, which was often of a repetitive
nature.  He
believed the plaintiff would be able to do light work, such as
light social work, or administrative work or clerical work but would
not be
able to use a computer or do a lot of keyboard work.  He thought that the
plaintiff might be able to do some light cleaning
work or security work.  Mr
Rymer, a chiropractor in his report dated 15 October 1996, and Dr Caspary, an
orthopaedic surgeon in his
report of 1 April 1997, agreed with this opinion.
Dr Caspary was also of the view that the plaintiff could expect ongoing pain in
his lumbosacral spine.
<P>

53  	The plaintiff's current complaints are that he has a great neck
provided he does not use it too much.  Nodding his head causes
pain and he
cannot swivel his head around to talk to students.  The plaintiff's neck has
remained in the same condition.  There are
periods when his neck is pain free.
His back is never pain free and is getting worse.  He cannot clean the bathroom
walls or the
floors.  He cannot master ironing sitting on a stool.  The above
activities cause back pain because he is bending at a slight angle
but he can
paint.  He does not take any regular medication.
<P>

54  	The plaintiff described the current condition of his left wrist
as hopeless.  The plaintiff's dominant hand is his right one.
 According to the
plaintiff he does not have 10 percent of the strength in his wrist that he had
prior to the accident although I
think that he has somewhat more strength in
his wrist than his estimate.  It is difficult to lift a can off the supermarket
shelf.
 He can lift his left wrist and arm.  He has a scar on his left wrist.
However, he does not have full movement in rotating his left
thumb but can
rotate his fingers but not to the extent he could before the accident.  The
fleshy part of his palm below his thumb
aches "like hell" and his fingers lock
up and stop working.  He does not have full movement in his fingers.  His wrist
is getting
worse as he cannot keep the muscle strength up and the muscles
around his wrist are wasting away.  His left wrist aches all the time
but he
has become accustomed to it.
<P>

55  	Prior to the accident the plaintiff enjoyed playing tennis and
coaching school children after school in soccer and basketball
and netball.  He
is a trained soccer coach.  His general health was good.  After the accident he
could not play sport nor coach it.
 Even though he could kick a ball and run a
little he was not able to do these things to the standard necessary.  Nor could
he enjoy
them.
<P>

56  	The plaintiff claims general damages of $100,000 and interest at
2% on half ($50,000) for 6.5 years = $6,500.
<P>

57  	For a while after the accident the plaintiff experienced pain in
his head and right wrist but these resolved.  I take into
account that the
plaintiff has suffered a serious and permanent injury to his left wrist.  I
accept that his left wrist has little
strength and movement, it aches, his
thumb and fingers are restricted, his fingers lock up and his muscles are now
wasting away.
 He continues to suffer pain in his back and neck.  He cannot sit
or stand in the same position for extended periods of time.  He
cannot play
sport or enjoy sporting activities and has difficulties with household chores.
He cannot work as an electrician or in
a similar trade as he cannot work in
floor or ceiling spaces and crouched positions and pull cables with his
hands.
<P>

58  	Having taken the above into account I would have assessed
general damages at $80,000.  I would have assessed interest on general
damages
at 2% on $40,000 for 6.5 years.  This amounts to $5,200.
<P>

<b><u>Past and future loss of earning capacity</u></b>
<P>

59  	Damages for both past and future loss are allowed to an injured
plaintiff because the diminution of his earning capacity is
or may be
productive of financial loss.  The plaintiff claims that as a result of the
injuries that he sustained in the accident
he is unable to return to his
pre-accident employment as an electrician.  For past loss of earning capacity
the plaintiff claims
$800 net per week from the date of the accident to date,
less what he has earned.  In total the plaintiff claims $65,000 for past
economic loss and interest on $26,865 at 6% for 3.5 years = $5,641.  Interest
calculated on $26,865 at 11% for 3 years is $8,865.
  For future loss of
earning capacity the plaintiff claims $500 per week discounted at 3% and 15%
for vicissitudes.  The amount claimed
for loss of future earning capacity is
$346,970.
<P>

60  	In relation to past earnings, the income that Inco obtained was
due solely to the endeavours of the plaintiff in both obtaining
work and
carrying out the work of an electrician.  From time to time Inco employed
casual tradesmen.  Their wages were paid by Inco.
 All of Inco's income was
paid into the Wilke Family Trust (the trust).  It was in the discretion of the
trustees as to the amount
each beneficiary received from the trust each year.

<P>

61  	Between 1990 and 1994 the plaintiff derived income from Inco
Electrical Pty Limited and the Wilke Family Trust.  In 1990 the
trust earned
$295,357.  The plaintiff received $35,000 as wages and $18,910 from the trust
totalling $53,910.  The plaintiff's taxable
income was $51,544 less tax $16,898
= $666 net per week.  Jill Wilke received $35,000 as wages and $18,910 from the
trust = $53,910
= $670 net per week.  In 1991 the trust earned $267,005.  The
plaintiff received $18,451 as wages = $263 net per week and nil from
the trust.
In 1992 the trust earned $145,050.  The plaintiff received $20,000 as wages and
$10,085 from the trust = $440 net per
week.  The average net weekly earnings
for this 3 year period = $680.  As can be seen from the amounts, that trust
earned and the
distributions made to the plaintiff during the financial years
1990 to 1992 fluctuated from $263 net per week to $666 net per week.
 The wages
paid to the plaintiff by Inco Electrical were modest.  The income that the
plaintiff derived from the trust was also modest
in comparison to the income
received by the trust.
<P>

62  	In mid 1993 the plaintiff attempted to go back to work but he
could not physically do the work.  He tried to supervise and
employ workers but
with the size of the jobs he was doing he could not make enough profit.  He
tried for a couple of years to get
back to work.  In 1993 the plaintiff had a
taxable income of $35,968 ($27,240 Inco Electrical Pty Limited and $9,923 from
the trust).
 Dr Urs, the plaintiff's general practitioner assessed that the
plaintiff was unfit for work until 8 August 1994.  I accept that
the plaintiff
was unfit for work until 8 August 1994.  For the year ended 30 June 1994 the
plaintiff had a taxable income of $33,149
derived from Inco Electrical $20,000
and $13,115 from the trust ($480 net per week).  Inco ceased to be active.
<P>

63  	On 14 September 1994 the plaintiff was employed at the Ryde
Family Support Service as a centre co-ordinator.  This centre was
called the
Kuringai Career Transition Centre and its aim was to locate and try to find
work for families of people who had become
unemployed.  The plaintiff said that
the only qualifications he needed to get the job was his driver's licence and
his own car. 
While employed at the centre he undertook counselling work
although he was not qualified in that field.  He made an attempt to obtain
some
qualifications and attended the College of Applied Psychology full time for one
year and then another year part time then he
ran out of money and was unable to
continue.  (t 14.38;  t 15.20).  For the year ended 30 June 1995 the plaintiff
had a taxable income
of $25,845 ($400 net per week) derived mainly from Ryde
Family Support Service.
<P>

64  	As well as his job with the centre the plaintiff worked part
time from August 1995 until January 1996 for an organisation called
Options
Community Training as a case manager working with the long term unemployed.  He
was also involved in counselling unemployed
professionals.  The plaintiff left
this employment as he was unable to handle the pressure.  (t 15.40-53;  t
16.5-10).  The plaintiff
was unemployed from March 1996 until August 1996.  For
the year ended 30 June 1996 the plaintiff had a taxable income of $20,807
($334
net per week).
<P>

65  	On 23 August 1996 the plaintiff commenced working for Bridge
Business College (the College) as a computer teacher although
he had no
qualifications in that field.  At present he is employed as a business teacher
at the college on a part time casual basis.
 For the year ended 30 June 1997
the plaintiff had a taxable income of $40,347 ($775 net per week).  He normally
works four days
a week but has been off work of late because his back "has been
a bit of a shit" (t 16.35-55).  He teaches one or two students in
each class (t
45.50) and teaches such subjects as workplace industrial relations, workplace
reform and industrial environment.  For
the first years with the College he
taught a course in computers for which he had minimal skills.  He currently
earns $30 per hour
and works about 30 hours per week.  He does not think that
he can physically work 40 or 50 hours per week.  The plaintiff also said
that
it was a lot of pressure to do that much teaching work.  Currently the College
does not have any more work available (t 46).
<P>

66  	So far as the future is concerned the plaintiff said that he
needs a change as his job at the College caters to overseas students
and as the
Government is continually revamping the private colleges to bring them up to a
higher standard, part of that being that
teachers are to have some teaching
qualifications in the field that they are teaching, and he does not have any
qualification other
than having done a "train the trainer" class for three days
(t 17.20.). With teaching, he can move about if his back gives him trouble.
 He
can sit in a chair and when his back hurts he can get up and sit on a table or
walk around a room.  He is capable of continuing
his employment as a
teacher.
<P>

67  	Mr Keith Dawes, a psychologist, in his report dated 23 February
1994 stated that he assessed the plaintiff's intellectual capacity
by
administering the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.  The plaintiff's verbal
ability and performance score was better than 80%
of the general population.
In terms of intelligence the plaintiff was assessed as better than 85% of his
peers.  It was Mr Dawes'
view that the plaintiff would operate competently as
an independently employed counsellor, a trades co-ordinator or as a member of
a
health based team.  He had a considerable experience in managing people,
relating to clients, record keeping and planning.  He
had demonstrated ability
to manage others.  Mr Dawes' opinion was that the plaintiff showed a clear
indication of success in retraining
as a counsellor/co-ordinator.  He has the
necessary intellectual capacity, interest and personality attributes to
successfully complete
tertiary study.  The course of study which he has
selected is highly likely to fulfil his need for successful retraining.
<P>

68  	The plaintiff gave evidence that as much as he would love to go
back to being an electrician, because of the state of his back
and wrist this
is not possible (t 17.30).  He can dig for a short time with one hand.  He
cannot do two handed tasks.  He cannot
work in floor and ceiling spaces in
crouched positions.  He can not pull cables with his hands.  It would be
necessary for him to
do these movements to carry out his tasks as an
electrician.  As previously stated, the plaintiff's view that he cannot return
to
work as an electrician is supported by Drs Caspary, Conrad and Herbert and I
find that due to the injury to the plaintiff's wrist
suffered in the accident,
he is no longer able to work as an electrician.  I accept that after the
accident the plaintiff attempted
to employ and supervise casual employees but
found that running the business without the benefit of his labour was not
viable.
<P>

69  	In <b><u>Husher v Husher &amp; Anor</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 47</a>, The
High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) stated (at para 18) that
the financial loss of what (if there had been no
accident) the injured
plaintiff would (as opposed to could) have expected to have under his or her
control and at his or her disposal
by exercising that earning capacity are the
financial rewards from work that are the rewards that the plaintiff would have
been able
to direct to whatever purpose or destination the plaintiff chose.  In
the present case, the whole of the income of the trust came
from the efforts
and the exploitation of the plaintiff's earning capacity.  As a matter of
practical reality the contribution of
the plaintiff's father and later those of
his wife contribution to the trust were negligible.
<P>

70  	The Wilke Family Trust was a trust that could be wound up and
the assets distributed.  It was the plaintiff's choice as to
whether the trust
was maintained.  If he chose to make some other arrangement concerning the
fruits of his labour, the effect would
have been given to that choice whatever
view his father or wife would have held.  This raises two questions:  (1) would
the plaintiff,
but for the accident, have continued as an electrician with the
current financial arrangement;  and (2) what would have been his
earning
capacity?
<P>

71  	In relation to the amount that should be allowed for payment of
taxation, the High Court in <b><u>Husher</u></b> referred to <b><u>Spargo v
Haden Engineering</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1993/4412.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] SASC 3793</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2060%20SASR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 60 SASR 39</a>, a decision of the South Australian
Court of Appeal.  The High Court accepted the adjustment made by Perry J.  In
<b><u>Spargo</u></b> the plaintiff had been employed as a sheet metal worker by
a company which was trustee of a discretionary family trust.  The plaintiff
had
generated the only income received by the trustee company and that income was
distributed to the plaintiff and members of his
family.  The court held that
the damages to be allowed to the plaintiff for loss of future earning capacity
should be calculated
by reference to the whole of the income he had generated.
Perry J said:
<P>

<b>"But it does not follow that if the Court should properly have regard to the
total income produced in the business in assessing the
plaintiff's loss of
earning capacity, in determining the net income for the purpose of calculating
the amount to be allowed for loss
of earning capacity, only the small amounts
of tax, if any, paid by the various family members with reference to the
amounts allocated
to them, should be deducted.  To do so, is to be
over-generous to the plaintiff. If he is to be given the benefit of aggregating
the distributed income for the purposes of measuring his earning capacity, the
allowance for income tax in determining the net earnings
should approximate the
amount which he might have paid on the gross earnings if they had been brought
to account by him rather than
by the family trust."</b>
<P>

72  	The plaintiff to some extent, would have exploited his own
earning capacity to generate net income of a particular amount.
 I say to some
extent, because the amount the plaintiff could earn as an electrician is
dependent on the amount of work that is available
in the building industry at
any particular time and this fluctuates.  However, there is no reason to doubt
that, but for the accident,
Inco would have continued to be sub-contracted by
Rondal to carry out electrical work.
<P>

73  	It is my view that the plaintiff may not have continued being
self employed (through his company) as an electrician until his
retirement at
65 years even if he did not have the accident.  At the time of the accident the
plaintiff had been involved in the
electrical trade for almost 20 years.  The
plaintiff gave evidence that until then it had been a passion.  However by
1987, the plaintiff
recognised that he did not want to still be walking through
ceilings when he was 65 years old but that he still wished to continue
working
as a tradesman but doing different types of electrical work (t 40.15-35).  In
cross examination the plaintiff admitted he
has always been interested in
psychology but denied that in 1987 he nearly left his work as an electrician to
go to university and
study psychology.  This is at odds with a letter (Ex 1D/4)
he wrote to a psychologist dated 13 March 1987 that he was suffering from
burn
out and this year he nearly left work and went to university to study
psychology as his major subject.  The plaintiff's explanation
was that he was
going through a very bad emotional state and had been told by the psychologist
that he was experiencing "burn out".
 The plaintiff thought a change in career
could bring life back into the family and fix his problems.  After thinking
about the career
change, he decided not to adopt this course.  He admitted that
he always wanted to be a counsellor and when he resumed work after
the
accident, that is exactly the path he followed.
<P>

74  	The plaintiff had expressed a desire to make a career change,
but continued to work as an electrician for a further 5 years
to the date of
the accident.  He would have, whether or not the accident occurred,  attempted
to ease himself out of the physical
work of an electrician as he did not still
want to be walking through ceilings when he was 65 years old.  He may have
still been
working in the trades but in a more supervisory role or
alternatively he may have pursued his desire to be a counsellor. He has always
demonstrated the commitment to work and that did not and would not have changed
whether the accident had occurred or not.  He would
have continued to earn a
reasonable income.  Doing the best I can, I would find that the plaintiff would
have earned $700 net per
week from two sources, Inco Electrical and the
distributions from the trust.  I would have assessed the plaintiff's past
economic
loss from 24 December 1992 to 8 August 1994 at $700 net per week.
From 8 August 1994 to date I would have assessed the plaintiff's
past economic
loss as being what he could have earned at $750 net per week less what he has
actually earned.  The parties can calculate
this amount and interest due on
past economic loss.
<P>

75  	For the future, he would have earned $800 to $900 net per week.
He probably could have earned more taking into account the
comfortable position
of the trust but he would have, in some years in the future, made a career
shift which may have resulted in
a decrease in financial remuneration for some
time.  He is currently earning about $764 net per week but I accept that this
job is
insecure and the plaintiff may be forced on the open labour market where
he has limited experience and qualifications.  He cannot
do physical work nor
stand or sit for long periods of time or use his left hand.  He is intelligent
and resourceful, can manage people,
keep records and plan.  He is self
motivated.  I assess his loss of earning capacity at $100 net per week until he
reaches the age
of 65 years.  This should be discounted at 3% and 15% for
vicissitudes.  The parties can calculate this sum.
<P>

<b><u>Past Out-of-pocket expenses</u></b>
<P>

76  	Past out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed at $19,807.  These
out-of-pocket expenses have been paid.
<P>

<b><u>Workers compensation payback</u></b>
<P>

77  	Workers compensation payback is $38,135.
<P>

<b><u>Future out-of-pocket expenses</u></b>
<P>

78  	The plaintiff claims $10,000 for future out-of-pocket expenses.
I would not have allowed this sum.
<P>

<b><u>Future treatment</u></b>
<P>

79  	In the Part 33 particulars the plaintiff has claimed $15,000 for
the costs of operative treatment for a fusion in the left
wrist in the not too
distant future.  Dr Caspary estimated that the costs of a possible limited
fusion which would include overall
hospital, medical and associated costs would
be in the region of $8,000.  The period of hospitalisation would be 2 to 3 days
and
the period of total absence would be for about 2 months.  A further period
of 4 months of light duty restrictions would apply.  The
plaintiff's treating
orthopaedic specialist does not specifically recommend it and the plaintiff did
not give any evidence that he
would contemplate undergoing this operation and
appeared reluctant to have any further treatment.  It is my view that it is
unlikely
that he will undergo this operation but in accordance with <b><u>Malec
v J C Hutton Pty Ltd</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a> I should make some allowance
for the possibility.  I would have allowed the sum of $1,800.00.
<P>

80  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Verdict and judgment in favour of the defendants.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

(3)	Verdict for the cross defendant on the cross claims.
<P>

(4)	The cross claimants are to pay cross defendant's costs on the cross
claims.
