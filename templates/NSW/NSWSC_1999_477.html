<center><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: By Notice of Motion filed 10 July 1998 the Second
Defendant seeks that the proceedings against him be dismissed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part
13</a> Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules.  On 21 August 1998 Master Harrison
dismissed the application.  By Notice of Appeal filed on 16
September 1998, the
Second Defendant appealed against the Master's decision. 
<P>

2	The factual background against which the issue posed for determination arises
is as follows.  The Plaintiff alleges that the First
and Second Defendants were
negligent in their conduct of a conveyancing transaction for the Plaintiff, the
Second Defendant being
the First Defendant's employee at the time.  The
application before the Master and before me has proceeded on the basis that any
liability the Defendants have or had to the Plaintiff was as joint tortfeasors.
The claim between the Plaintiff and the First Defendant
has been settled.  A
deed of release was executed, providing that in consideration of the payment of
the sum of $250,000 the Plaintiff
released the First Defendant from any claim
in relation to the cause of action pleaded in the proceedings but providing for
the continuation
of the proceedings.  Later, Terms of Settlement were filed,
paragraph 1 of which states:-
<P>

	"That there be verdict and judgment against the first defendant in the sum of
$250,000." 
<P>

3	The $250,000 has been paid.  The Second Defendant contends that in
consequence of these matters the claim against him cannot succeed.
 It is said
firstly, that the Plaintiff has received full satisfaction of the joint
liability of the Defendants.  Secondly, it is
submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(1)(b)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946</a> precludes the Plaintiff from
obtaining judgment for more than $250,000 and, the Plaintiff having received
this sum, further proceedings
are therefore futile.
<P>

4	So far as is presently relevant <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5</a> provides:-
<P>

	"5.	(1)	Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether
a crime or not) -
<P>

	(a)  judgment recovered against any tort-feasor liable in respect of that
damage shall not be a bar to an action against any other
person who would, if
sued, have been liable as a joint tort-feasor in respect of the same damage;
<P>

	(b)  if more than one action is brought in respect of that damage by or on
behalf of the person by whom it was suffered, or for
the benefit of the estate,
or of the wife, husband, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, parent or
child, of that person,
against tort-feasors liable in respect of the damage
(whether as joint tort-feasors or otherwise) the sums recoverable under the
judgments given in those actions by way of damages shall not in the aggregate
exceed the amount of the damages awarded by the judgment
first given; and in
any of those actions, other than that in which judgment is first given, the
plaintiff shall not be entitled to
costs unless the court is of opinion that
there was reasonable ground for bring the action;"
<P>

5	The effect of legislation in similar terms has been the subject of
consideration by the High Court in two cases to which I was
referred, <b>XL
Petroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d1985%29%20155%20CLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-1985) 155
CLR 448</a> and <b>Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20574" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186
CLR 574.</a>  It will be convenient to refer to those cases as "<b>XL</b>" and
<b>Thompson</b>.  It will also be convenient in the discussion which follows to
substitute reference to the corresponding sub-section or paragraph
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946</a> for the references to the
legislation of other jurisdictions considered in those decisions.  In those
cases it was recognised or
decided that:-
<P>

	(i)  Prior to the introduction of the section, there was only one cause of
action against joint tortfeasors and only one judgment
for one sum of damages
could be given in favour of the Plaintiff - <b>XL</b> at 454.3 and 459.9.
<P>

	(ii)  This old common law rule had been abolished in its entirety by
sub-section 1(a) - <b>XL</b> at 459.9 - 460.2, <b>Thompson</b> at 584.2.
<P>

	(iii)  More than one judgment may be given against joint tortfeasors for
damages caused by a joint tort - <b>XL</b> at 459.9.
<P>

	(iv)  Those judgments may be in different amounts in a proper case - <b>XL</b>
at 461.2.
<P>

	(v)  This is so whether the Plaintiff brings separate actions or the joint
tortfeasors are sued in the one action - <b>XL</b> at 460.3.
<P>

	(vi)  The concept of a single wrong and single cause of action having gone,
the rule that a release given by one joint tortfeasor
releases any others must
have gone with it - <b>Thompson </b> at 584.
<P>

6	The passages in <b>XL </b>to which I have referred are in the judgment of
Gibbs CJ.  The remarks of at least Mason and Wilson JJ at pp 464 and 465
indicate
agreement with these conclusions.  See also Brennan J at p465.  The
passages from <b>Thompson</b> are to be found in the joint judgment of the
majority, Brennan CJ and Dawson and Toohey JJ.
<P>

7	The "proper case" that was under consideration in <b>XL</b> was one where
there was a claim for exemplary damages against one of the joint tortfeasors
but not against the others.  Brennan J
recognised that different evidence in
separate actions might also lead to differing awards - at 466.4.  Sub-paragraph
(b) indeed
recognises the same limiting only "the sums recoverable under" those
judgments so that in the aggregate the Plaintiff does not recover
more than the
amount of the judgment in the first action.  The provisions of this
sub-paragraph do not apply to the case where more
than one judgment is given in
a single action - <b>Wah Tat Bank Ltd v Chan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20AC%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) AC 507</a> at 519.  Gibbs
CJ, and those who agreed with His Honour would seem to have endorsed this
approach in <b>XL</b> at p458.
<P>

8	Having regard to these various matters, there is nothing in the Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions)Act which makes the Plaintiff's
claim unmaintainable.

<P>

9	In support of the other basis on which the Second Defendant put its motion
reference was made to <b>Bryanston Finance Ltd v de Vries</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%201%20QB%20703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 1 QB 703.</a>
In that case three plaintiffs had issued a writ for libel against de Vries and
Lord Carberry.  The latter paid 10 pounds into court.
 Later the dispute
between the plaintiffs and Lord Carberry was settled and consent orders in the
following terms were approved:-
<P>

	"Judgment for the plaintiffs against the second defendant Baron Carberry for
1000 pounds, being his proportion of the damages and
1,250 pounds being his
proportion of the costs , to be paid by the second defendant ..." 
<P>

	An order for the payment out to the plaintiffs or their solicitors of the
moneys paid into court on behalf of the second defendant
<P>

10	No formal judgment was drawn up although nothing seems to have turned on
that.  Subsequently a trial was had of the libel action
against de Vries and
judgment was given against him in favour of one plaintiff in the sum of 300
pounds, and in favour of the other
two plaintiffs in the sum of 100 pounds
each.  De Vries appealed.  Inter alia he claimed that the plaintiff's claim
against him was
foreclosed by the earlier orders and the terms of settlement
they reflected.
<P>

11	All three judges agreed that if the earlier judgment had been satisfied,
then the Plaintiffs were not entitled to any further
judgement - see pp 722,
733 and 739.  In <b>XL</b> (at 458) Gibbs CJ said the same.
<P>

12	Before me there was little, if any, development of this principle or
consideration of its rationale, nor of exceptions to it,
nor of the question
whether, given the circumstances of the settlement between the Plaintiff and
the First Defendant, the principle
had any application.  The authorities to
which I have referred were the only ones mentioned.
<P>

13	That basic proposition is not one peculiar to the situation of joint
tortfeasors.  It may be based on the view that "as soon
as the damage is
repaired or made up to the party hurt by any one of (the concurrent
tortfeasors), the obligation is extinguished
as to the rest: for an obligation
founded solely upon damage cannot possibly continue after the damage ceases to
exist" - <b>Erskine's Institutes </b>III, Title 1, para 15, or an equitable
doctrine designed to prevent unjust enrichment by double compensation or
otherwise - <b>D'Angela v Rio Pioneer Gravel Co Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20NSWLR%20495" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 NSWLR 495</a>
at 499 - but whatever be the reason there are many other authorities to like
effect.  Early authorities are referred to in Glanville
Williams <b>Joint Torts
and Contributory Negligence</b> para 9.  See also <b>Castellan v Electric Power
Transmission Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2069%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 69 SR (NSW) 159</a> at 180-181, and <b>Ruffino v
Grace Bros Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%201%20NSWLR%20732" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 1 NSWLR 732.</a>  In the latter case Master Allen,
referring to <b>Carrigan v Duncan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1971%20SLT%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1971 SLT 33</a>, recognised the possibility
that if a Plaintiff receives payment otherwise than as full satisfaction of the
defendants' liability,
that payment may not be a bar to proceedings against
another tortfeasor. <b>Carrigan v Duncan</b> and some of the cases referred to
in it certainly support that approach which may echo the sort of circumstances
referred to by Glanville
Williams at page 46 note 8.
<P>

14	As I have indicated, the Terms of Settlement entered into between the
Plaintiff and the First Defendant did contemplate that
the action against the
Second Defendant would continue.  If one is entitled to go outside merely the
terms of the judgment itself,
it is therefore clear that none of the parties
concerned in its entry intended that the judgment sum would define the extent
of the
Plaintiff's loss or damages or recovery entitlement.  The reference in
the Terms of Settlement to the continuation of the proceedings
may fairly be
regarded as an express reservation of the Plaintiff's rights against the Second
Defendant even in the case of payment
of the amount referred to in those
Terms.
<P>

15	Does the judgment sum define the Plaintiff's entitlement, notwithstanding
the circumstances surrounding its entry?  I do not
believe this is a matter I
should decide finally in an application such as this when the matter was not
fully argued.  The authorities
showing the court's approach in applications
such as this are set forth in the judgment of the Master from which this appeal
is brought.
 They were not canvassed again before me.  They dictate that a
court should be reluctant to deprive a party of a trial unless persuaded
that
that party cannot succeed.
<P>

16	Compromise of litigation is to be encouraged, even if it is only partial.
At common law judgment against one was not definitive
of the amount of the
Plaintiff's damages and judgment could be given against a second for a higher
amount - Glanville Williams, page
39.  Sub-section 5(1)(b) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a> indeed recognises that this can still occur,
although where this occurs in successive actions, the amount recoverable is
limited
to that awarded in the first action.  If a judgment, even one
reflecting a determination by a Court of the amount of damages is not
definitive, why should payment of an agreed amount, even if it is embodied in a
judgment, do so?
<P>

17	I do not seek to decide these issues.  Despite the weight of the two
authorities on which the Second Defendant relied, I am not
persuaded that it
would be a proper exercise of my discretion to summarily dismiss the
proceedings.  The application fails.
<P>

18	The question of costs was not argued.  My inclination is to make them costs
in the cause, partly because of the basis on which
I have decided the
application and partly because there was less than full argument on both sides
on the issue just considered. 
However I will hear argument on costs if either
party wishes to advance it.
