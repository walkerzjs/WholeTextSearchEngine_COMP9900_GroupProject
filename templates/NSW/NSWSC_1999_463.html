<b>JUDGMENT-- Ex Tempore</b>
<P>

<b>22 April 1999</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the registered proprietor of rural land
for extension of a caveat.  The circumstances are
that the applicant was a
farmer who carried on some form of farming operation upon the property until
1995. She was then severely
injured and has been living in South Australia
where she has not had any occupation though she has qualified to enrol in a
farming
degree or diploma at Flinders University in South Australia.
<P>

2	The property was subject to a mortgage in favour of the defendant.  The
defendant has in fact exercised power of sale - the plaintiff
would say
purported to do so - and has sold the property - the plaintiff would say
purported to sell the property - to a third party
who has, according to
Counsel, and somewhat surprisingly, completed the purchase.  There is however a
caveat lodged by the plaintiff
which prevents registration of the transfer to
this third party.  The plaintiff's contention is that she has a caveatable
interest
and is entitled under s74F(2) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i> to lodge
and maintain a caveat, on the basis that she "fears an improper dealing with
the estate.. ".
<P>

3	The essential basis for the contention that this is an improper dealing is
that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act</i> 1994</a> (NSW) has not been complied with
in that the defendant lender has failed to give the necessary notice
preparatory to engaging in
a farming mediation as required by that Act.
<P>

4	The short answer to that contention is this. For that Act to apply, there has
to be a "farm debt", and there has to be a "farm
mortgage". The latter in turn
requires a "farming operation ", carried on by a "farmer"; each of those terms
are defined by the Act.
There has been since 1995, no farming operation carried
on on the property.  There is no cattle stock grazing, and no crops. The
property has not been managed even on a care and maintenance basis during the
plaintiffs enforced absence.  What is argued is that
the plaintiff had her
capital invested in what had been a farm in 1995; through circumstances outside
her control, she had not carried
on any farming operations but that these were
in effect still to be treated as sufficiently carried on merely from the
continued
investment of her capital in what had once been a farming property.
However the problem with that contention, which I am satisfied
is insuperable,
is that there was no mere brief suspension of a farming operation, but a
cessation that occurred in 1995, and continues
to this day. There investment of
capital cannot suffice. To describe it as a "suspension" is thus not strictly
accurate.  There is
simply no farming operation extant, though no doubt it
could be resumed.  The length of time which has passed since operations ceased
with occupation in 1995, means that this is no mere suspension of an active
farming operation capable of being viewed as somehow
continuing, albeit
passively.
<P>

5	In those circumstances, even if the Plaintiff could overcome the other
formidable barriers based on balance of convenience in
the way of extending a
caveat such as the position of the purchaser who presumably acquired without
notice of any basis for setting
aside the contract, with the further fact that
the plaintiff failed to put herself in a position to receive any notice from
the lender/
mortgagee, such that she delayed in taking any action until now,
the threshold difficulty remains that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act</a></i> simply
does not apply in the present circumstances.
<P>

6	Thus, there is no basis for the caveat, more particularly a caveat that
depends on the apprehension of an improper dealing. There
is simply no improper
dealing by the mortgagee in favour of the entirely innocent purchaser.
