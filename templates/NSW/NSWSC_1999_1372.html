<center>JUDGMENT<p>
</center><p>
SIMPSON J:  I agree with the orders of Justice Hidden and his reasons
therefor.<p>
<p>
HIDDEN J:<p>
<p>
	This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences passed upon the
applicant after he pleaded guilty before Nield DCJ
at Liverpool District Court
to a variety of charges.  The charges and sentences were as follows:<p>
1.	Culpable driving:  fixed term of 6 months imprisonment for 27 July 1995
(licence disqualified for 3 years).<p>
2.	Break enter and steal:  fixed term of 3 years penal servitude from 27 July
1995.<p>
3.	Break enter and steal:  penal servitude for 5 years, comprising a minimum
term of 3 years from 27 July 1995 and an additional
term of 2 years.<p>
4.	Attempt break and enter with intent to steal:  fixed term of 3 years penal
servitude from 27 July 1995.<p>
5.	Possess housebreaking implements:  fixed term of 1 year from 27 July 1995.<p>
6.	Assault police officer in the execution of his duty:  fixed term of 2 years
imprisonment from 27 July 1995.<p>
	<p>
	An existing periodic detention order was cancelled and his Honour directed
that the balance of that term be served concurrently
with the sentences which
he had imposed.  The effective overall sentence then was a minimum term of 3
years from 27 July 1995, and
an additional term of 2 years.<p>
<p>
<u>Facts.</u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>	The facts of the various offences can be briefly stated.  The charge of
culpable driving arose from a head-on collision between a
vehicle driven by the
applicant and another vehicle in the Wellington area on 21 December 1992.  It
seems that the applicant fell
asleep at the wheel, having earlier been warned
by a police officer that it was not safe to drive because he was tired.  As a
result
his defacto wife suffered serious injuries.  He himself was injured, a
matter to which it will be necessary to return.<p>
<p>
	On 14 July 1995, he broke into adjoining home units at Casula and stole
property, this activity giving rise to the two charges of
break enter and
steal.  On 27 July 1995, he attempted to break into a home at Bonnyrigg with
intent to steal, but was disturbed while
doing so.  As police sought to
apprehend him, he brandished an axe and swung it towards one of the officers.
He was disarmed and
arrested and, upon being searched, was found to be in
possession of a screwdriver.  It was this incident which gave rise to the
charges
of attempt break and enter with intent, assault police and possess
housebreaking implements (the axe and the screwdriver).  His Honour
expressed
himself satisfied that the applicant carried the axe for the purpose of
housebreaking, not for assault.<p>
<p>
	At the time of the culpable driving the applicant was on a recognisance
granted in September 1992 in respect of a charge of entering
enclosed lands
with intent.  At the time of the later offences he was serving periodic
detention imposed in May 1995 on charges of
assault occasioning actual bodily
harm, break and enter and possess housebreaking implements.  Further, after his
arrest for the
break and enter offences of 14 July 1995, he was released on
bail and was subject to that bail undertaking at the time of the offences
of 27
July.<p>
<p>
<u>Subjective Matters.</u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>	The applicant is now 34 years old.  He has a criminal record which is
quite sporadic in earlier years, containing entries in 1977,
1980 and 1983.
Nothing further is recorded until September 1992, when he was convicted of the
charge of enter enclosed land with
intent, referred to above.  In 1993 he was
twice before courts on charges of break enter and steal, and in 1995 he was
convicted
of a minor matter to which I need not refer, and was dealt with for
the matters previously mentioned for which he was sentenced to
periodic
detention for 12 months.<p>
<p>
	His relationship with his defacto wife was of long standing and there are four
children of that union.  He is of limited education
and, over the years, has
had various labouring jobs and some period of unemployment.<p>
<p>
	The applicant did not give evidence before his Honour, but he told a probation
officer that he had used marijuana since his mid
teens and had taken to heroin
after the car accident.  He told police that the 1995 offences were the result
of his drug problem,
which had left him unable to provide for his children, and
his Honour appears to have accepted this.  The applicant's brother, a
drug and
alcohol counsellor with the Aboriginal Medical Service at Redfern, gave
evidence that he became addicted to morphine whilst
in hospital after the car
accident, and that after his discharge the applicant had "taken certain drugs
to help him with his pain
and the addiction from morphine".  It is not entirely
clear from the remarks on sentence what his Honour's assessment of this
evidence
was.  As I read them, it seems that his Honour was prepared to accept
that his treatment with morphine in hospital led to his heroin
addiction, even
though there was no evidence to confirm it.<p>
<p>
	The brother said that the applicant had more recently come to realise that his
drug abuse was harming his family and himself and
was motivated to address the
problem.  Before his Honour was a drug and alcohol report from the Department
of Corrective Services
to the same effect, and there were also a number of
certificates attesting to his participation in educational courses whilst in
custody.  Those steps towards rehabilitation and his need for counselling in
relation to his drug problem led his Honour to find
special circumstances, so
as to fix a longer than usual additional term.<p>
<p>
<u>The Application.</u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>	Before us the applicant was represented by Mr Segal of counsel, who did
not appear for him in the District Court.  The effective
sentence is challenged
only on the basis that it fails to give adequate weight to the applicant's
physical injuries arising from
the car accident, and their effect upon the
conditions of his custody.<p>
<p>
	Apart from the brief reference to his physical injuries in the evidence of the
applicant's brother, which I have mentioned, there
was no evidence before his
Honour on this matter.  As I have said, the applicant gave no evidence, and
there was no medical evidence.
 It seems that the injuries were referred to by
the solicitor then appearing for the applicant, both in written and oral
submissions,
which led his Honour to observe in his remarks:<p>
	"It is the fact that, as a result of the motor vehicle collision on 21
December 1992, he suffered injuries and that those injuries
have resulted in
some permanent disabilities.  I do not think, however, in the absence of
medical evidence, that his disabilities
are as severe as they have been
painted.  If they were I would have expected that medical evidence would have
been produced."<p>
<p>
	It is impossible to challenge that finding on the material that was before his
Honour.  We have been supplied with a copy of the
solicitor's written
submissions which make laconic reference to the applicant's injuries, but we
cannot know what was put in oral
submissions as they have not been transcribed.
However, before us, Mr Segal had relied upon an affidavit of the applicant
sworn in
December 1996, setting out his injuries and their effects and the
applicant expanded that material somewhat in oral evidence.  Again,
no medical
evidence was tendered.<p>
<p>
	The applicant's affidavit, in addition to setting out his injuries, recounts
an incident when he suffered violence in prison on
January 1996, and asserts
that he is susceptible to serious injury if assaulted.  In his oral evidence he
spoke of another incident
of violence in December 1996, which led to his
requiring surgical treatment.  Mr Segal submitted that this evidence was
admissible
as fresh evidence in accordance with the principles enunciated by
King CJ in <i>R v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2044%20SASR%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 44 SASR 587</a> at 588.  In a frequently cited
passage, the Chief Justice held that it was permissible for an appellate court
to have regard to events
occurring after sentence for the purpose of
demonstrating the true significance of a state of affairs which existed at the
time of
sentence and, in particular, so as to explain "the full extent and
implications" of an illness which the prisoner suffered at the
time of
sentence.  Mr Segal frankly explained that the absence of any medical evidence
before us was the result of the funding constraints
upon the regional
Aboriginal Legal Aid organisation which was instructing him.<p>
<p>
	No doubt in recognition of the exceptional nature of the case, the Crown
prosecutor, fairly in my view, did not object to our receiving
the affidavit
and the oral evidence.  Equally, our reception of the evidence is exceptional
and should in no way be seen as a precedent.
 The principle in <i>Smith</i> is
not a licence for legal practitioners to make passing reference in proceedings
at first instance to a matter about which evidence
could have been led, and
then ventilate the matter more fully on appeal.  In the context of a prisoner's
illness, King CJ's remarks
were directed to cases where there was evidence of
the illness before the sentencing court but the full significance of the
condition
was not understood until after sentence was passed, or where events
after sentence established that the prisoner suffered an illness
at the time of
sentence of which he was not then aware:  cf <i>Bailey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2036%20A%20Crim%20R%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 36 A Crim R
458.</a>  The principles which govern the admission of fresh evidence in
applications for leave to appeal against sentence are no different
from those
applicable to appeals against conviction:  <i>R v Lanham</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%202%20NSWR%20217" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 2 NSWR
217.</a><p>
<p>
	In his affidavit the applicant deposes that, as a result of the car accident,
he suffered fractures to his cheekbones, nose, jaw,
hip and pelvis, punctured
lungs and injuries to his right knee and foot.  The fractures to his cheekbones
required reconstructive
surgery and the insertion of plates into his cheeks.
As a result of the injuries to his lower limbs he walks with a limp, is
susceptible
to arthritis and is in constant pain.  He deposes also that he is
liable to serious injury if assaulted and, in the nature of things,
the risk of
violence in prison is high.<p>
<p>
	In his oral evidence he said that, as a result of the incident in December
1996 referred to above, the plates in his cheeks were
loosened and had to be
removed.  He had not sought protection as he believed that he was at risk of
assault by protected prisoners
as much as by others.  He acknowledged that he
had discussed the possibility of protection only with other prisoners and not
with
prison staff.<p>
<p>
	In cross examination, the Crown prosecutor did not challenge the applicant's
account of his injuries or of the two violent incidents.
 Given that he had
only late notice of the affidavit and there was no medical evidence, it is
difficult to see how he could have
done so.  Nevertheless, there is no reason
why the applicant's evidence, even though uncorroborated, should not be
accepted.<p>
<p>
	On the material before him it could not be said that Nield DCJ dealt with the
applicant other than humanely.  As the Crown prosecutor
properly reminded us,
the offences were serious and were committed whilst the applicant was subject
to one form of conditional liberty
or another.  Nevertheless, because of the
applicant's evidence before us about his injuries and the additional risk to
which he is
exposed whilst he is in custody, and for no other reason, I
consider that this Court should intervene.  The authorities on the relevance
to
sentence of a prisoner's state of health were reviewed by this Court in <i>Reg
v L</i> (unreported, 17 June 1996) at pp 6-8, and it is unnecessary to repeat
what is there set out.<p>
<p>
	In the event of resentence, we also received in evidence further certificates
attesting to the applicant's participation in the
prison's drug and alcohol
programme and in educational courses.  Taking all these matters into account, I
have determined that the
appropriate overall sentence is one of penal servitude
for 4 years, comprising a minimum term of 2 years and an additional term of
2
years.  To that end I would propose the following orders:<p>
<p>
1.	Leave is granted and the appeal allowed.<p>
2.	On the charge of break enter and steal from the premises of Mr Reddich on 14
July 1995, the sentence is quashed and the applicant
is sentenced to a fixed
term of 2 years penal servitude from 27 July 1995.<p>
3.	On the charge of breaking entering and stealing from the premises of Miss
Watson on 14 July 1995, the sentence is quashed and
the applicant is sentenced
to penal servitude for 4 years, comprising a minimum term of 2 years from 27
July 1995 and expiring on
26 July 1997, and an additional term of 2 years
commencing on 27 July 1997 and expiring on 26 July 1999.<p>
4.	On the charge of attempted break and enter with intent to steal, the
sentence is quashed and the applicant is sentenced to a fixed
term of 2 years
penal servitude to date from 27 July 1995.<p>
5.	The other sentences passed by Nield DCJ are confirmed.<p>
