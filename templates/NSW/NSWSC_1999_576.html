<b>2588/99 - RE ACN 059 849 017 PTY LTD &amp; THE CORPORATIONS LAW</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>  This is an application to wind up the company ACN 059
849 017 Pty Ltd.  The summons was filed in court this morning.  The  company
is
one of a group of companies which is a subsidiary of Allied Meridian Pty Ltd.
That company and its subsidiaries, including the
present company, were
allegedly under administration, Mr Lewis being the administrator, but in
proceedings 1990/99 I declared that
the administration was invalid.
<P>

2	Mr Lewis has, however, done considerable work in respect of the  company ACN
059 849 017 and prepared a report for creditors which
shows that it is
hopelessly insolvent.
<P>

3	The present application is made by Mr Gordon, who is one of the directors of
the company, so that Mr Lewis can continue his work
in another guise.
<P>

4	The application seems to be commercially sensible, but it is necessary to
steer one's way through Pt 5.4 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

5	First it should be remarked that as the administrator was invalidly appointed
there is no barrier under s 532 of the Corporations
Law to Mr Lewis being
appointed liquidator.  Secondly, a director may only make an application for
winding up in insolvency under
s 459P with leave, and that leave is to be given
if there is a prima facie case that the company is insolvent, and not
otherwise.
 The voluntary administrator's report to creditors of 27 April 1999
provides that evidence.
<P>

6	There is then the question as to whether on its proper construction Pt 5.4
only applies when a statutory demand has been given.
 Although the prime focus
of the Part is on giving a statutory demand, the phraseology in ss 459R and
459S show that winding up following
a statutory demand is not the exclusive way
of approaching insolvency and that view is confirmed, at least obliquely, by
cases such
as<b> Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/tas/TASSC/1994/126.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] TASSC 126</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2014%20ACSR%20580" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 14 ACSR 580.</a>
<P>

7	The application has not been advertised.  It is essential for the commercial
community that there be a public advertisement. 
In the instant case I am
prepared to dispense with advertisements that should have been placed before
today on the basis that all
the creditors have already been identified under
the invalid administration.  However, there should be an advertisement that
this
order has been made, so that the mercantile agencies and others who rely
on advertisements can be appraised of what has happened.
<P>

8	Accordingly, I make orders 1 to 4 in the summons.  I dispense with all the
advertisements prescribed by the Regulations, provided
that an advertisement in
Form 154B mutatis mutandis is published in 
<P>

the prescribed newspaper within ten days.
<P>
