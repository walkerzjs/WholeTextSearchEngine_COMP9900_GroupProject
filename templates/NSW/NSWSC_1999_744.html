<P>

TUESDAY 27 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>12804/1996</u>	<u>COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA v STEPHEN ROGER
CONLEY</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The proceedings were commenced in 1996.  The case as propounded
by the plaintiff is pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim
filed on 29
October 1996.  The defendant's case is as pleaded in the Amended Defence filed
on 5 June 1997.
<P>

2  	The hearing took place on 30 June 1999.  The plaintiff was
represented by Mr Burton of counsel.  The defendant appeared in person.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff's evidence in chief was largely formal.  It relied
on certain admissions and tendered Exhibits A and B.  The defendant
has relied
on two affidavits.  Both were sworn by himself and annex documentation.  The
plaintiff has identified many objections
to part of that material.  The course
was taken of reading the affidavits subject to the objections.  In reply, the
plaintiff relied
on four affidavits.  The defendant was briefly
cross-examined.
<P>

4  	The defendant had been a customer of the plaintiff for many
years.  There have been a number of lending transactions.  He made
the
applications.  The applications were assessed on information provided by him.
The advances were paid to him.  I shall briefly
refer to certain of these
transactions (being those that have relevance for present purposes).
<P>

5  	In March 1989, the defendant obtained a personal loan of
$20,000.00.  The advance was used to purchase a motor vehicle.
<P>

6  	In December 1990, the defendant obtained a further personal loan
in the sum of $20,000.00.  The advance was used to build a
road on a property
at Mudgee and to connect power and the telephone.
<P>

7  	In March 1991, he obtained a further loan of $84,000.00.  The
advance was used to pay out the two personal loans and to build
a house on the
Mudgee property.  The loan was secured by a second mortgage over the property
known as 52 Carefree Road North Narrabeen
(the property).
<P>

8  	In June 1992, a further advance was approved.  This saw the
existing loan being increased by $35,000.00.  The increased loan
was secured by
the existing second mortgage.
<P>

9  	It appears that until about late 1995/early 1996 the defendant
was able to service the lending arrangements had with the plaintiff.
 There is
material which suggests that prior to that time he was regarded as a good and
valued customer.  The material is not particularly
helpful as to how it came to
be that the defendant began to have problems in meeting his lending
commitments.
<P>

10  	He fell into default in late 1995/early 1996 and he has remained
in default under the mortgage.  Exhibit A (a certificate given
pursuant to the
mortgage) reveals a present indebtedness in the sum of $165,558.00.73.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff's claim is founded on that default.  It seeks both
possession of the property and judgment in a monetary sum.
<P>

12  	The defendant has prepared his own pleading.  Whilst there is no
Cross-claim as such, the Amended Defence contains material
which might be read
as a claim for relief in respect of the lending arrangements.
<P>

13  	Broadly speaking, in submissions, the defendant has identified
three areas upon which he seeks to defend the plaintiff's claim.
 Firstly, he
relies on the provisions of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</u> 1980</a> (the Act).
Secondly, he says that there was active encouragement by the plaintiff to him
to take out further loans without regard
to his current level of financial
commitment.  Thirdly, he said that the plaintiff was in breach of its lending
guidelines.
<P>

14  	The second and third matters do not of themselves constitute
individual defences to the plaintiff's claim for relief.  To the
extent that
they are relevant, they are to be seen in the context of the claim for relief
under the Act.
<P>

15  	The material does reveal correspondence from the plaintiff to
the defendant which may be seen as encouraging him to use the
lending
facilities provided by the Bank.  Despite this encouragement, I am not
satisfied that he was led to a position where he entered
into financial
commitments which he was not able to service.  I am not satisfied that there
was any breach of relevant guidelines.
<P>

16  	The picture revealed by the material is one of a customer well
able to service the relevant financial commitments over a period
of many years.
His difficulties did not arise until some years after the entry into of the
last of the relevant transactions.
<P>

17  	The Amended Defence does recite many of the matters which may be
found in the provisions of the Act.  The mere recitation of
some of these
matters (together with proof thereof) does not thereby lead to an entitlement
to relief under the Act.  In this case,
there was a lack of proof of
matters.
<P>

18  	It does appear that the defendant did not have the benefit of
any expert advice.  The plaintiff did not have any duty to give
him advice.  It
seems that the transactions were made between the parties themselves.  In his
oral evidence, the defendant conceded
that he had entered into each of the
transactions as a matter of his own choice.  It is not said that he lacked
understanding of
the relevant transactions.  The material does not reveal any
need for independent or expert advice.  He appears to have capably handled
his
affairs over many years.
<P>

19  	The mortgage is in standard form.  No particular  provision
thereof has been identified as the subject of any complaint.
<P>

20  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> of the Act confers a discretion on the Court to grant
any one or more of the heads of relief identified therein where it finds that
certain threshold requirements have been satisfied (inter alia, where it finds
a contract to have been unjust in the circumstances
relating to it at the time
it was made).  See <u>Nguyen v Taylor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 48</a> at 55-57 and 71-72
and <u>Younan &amp; Anor v Beneficial Finance Corporation Limited</u> (Court of
Appeal, 21 November 1994).  It may grant relief if it considers it just to do
so and for the purpose of avoiding as far
as practicable an unjust consequence
or result.  
<P>

21  	I have read the material relied on by the defendant.  I have had
reference to that which is relevant.  In my view, the defendant
falls well
short of satisfying the relevant threshold requirements and/or demonstrating an
entitlement to relief.
<P>

22  	This was a case in which the plaintiff's prima facie entitlement
to relief was not in dispute.  The relevant questions concern
the matter of
whether or not the defendant could make out his defence.  In my view, he has
failed to do so.
<P>

23  	I direct the entry of judgment for possession of the land
described in paragraph 2 of the Amended Statement of Claim filed
on 29 October
1996.  It may be that such judgment will suffice for present purposes.  The
plaintiff is to have liberty to apply for
judgment in a monetary sum and for
leave to issue a Writ of Possession.  The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's
costs to date. 
The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
