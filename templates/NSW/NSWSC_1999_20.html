<b><u>NO. 20399/97 - DRUMMOND v ANSTO</u></b>
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	In this matter application has been made by the Australian Nuclear Science
and Technology Organisation ("ANSTO"),  the defendant
in these proceedings, by
Notice of Motion filed 19 June 1996 for orders that ANSTO be granted an
extension of time to bring this
application; that this Court set aside the
originating process; or alternatively, that this Court decline, in the Court's
discretion,
to exercise its jurisdiction in the proceedings; or, alternatively,
that the proceedings be stayed on the basis that the respondent,
the plaintiff,
Bryn Drummond ("Drummond"),  has instituted the originating process in an
inappropriate forum, and further that Drummond
pay ANSTO's costs of the motion
and of the proceedings. 
<P>

	<b>The Facts Alleged</b>
<P>

2	For the purposes of this application, Drummond's allegations in the statement
of claim filed herein were that he was being treated
for hyperthyroidism at
Taranaki Base Hospital ("TBH") in New Zealand in May 1994. Batches of radio
active iodine were sent to New
Zealand on the same day and the address labels
and dangerous goods declarations were placed on the wrong containers as a
result of
which it is contended by Drummond that he was administered a dose 30
times that which is prescribed. The two doses of therapeutic
Iodine - 131 were
packaged at ANSTO's New South Wales premises and although the label stating the
contents was correct on each package
and on each container, the address labels
on the outside and the two dangerous goods declaration forms (which also
contained the
delivery address) for each of the two packages were swapped.
<P>

3	The two packages passed through both the cargo handling at Sydney Airport and
customs at Auckland Airport without the error being
detected, and it was not
until they taken by a courier for delivery to the intended hospitals that the
discrepancy was noted. The
activity on one of the two forms addressed to
Palmerston North Hospital ("PNH"), was crossed out and changed from 6,000 to
200 MBq
(the unit of measurement of radiation). The other form was however,
unaltered. 
<P>

4	During a routine check on 9 May 1994, at PNH the package marked at 200 MBq
had been delivered that morning was recognised as a
mistake as that belonging
to TBH. The technologist, Peter Gene, tried to telephone TBH but the lines were
engaged until after 9 am.
TBH received the 6,000 MBq package on the same day.
The senior nuclear medicine technologist at TBH was not working on 9 May 1994
but there were two technologists (Ms Mia le Blanc and Ms Victoria Brooks)
working. The 6,000 MBq package was first measured at the
surface using a survey
meter by Ms le Blanc and was recorded. Ms le Blanc failed to notice that the
capsule was in a larger lead
pot than those usually delivered. Ms le Blanc
opened the package, filed the packing slip and placed the inner container (a
tin) behind
lead shielding but failed to note the activity level on the packing
slip.
<P>

5	Ms Brooks, the second technologist opened the tin and noticed that the lead
pot was larger than normal but failed to appreciate
the significance of this.
Ms Brooks placed the vial containing the capsule in the well counter and read
the number as 385. The activity
prescribed is often 400 MBq, so she took this
reading to be 385 MBq. Ms Brooks then took the prescription form, identified
the patient,
Drummond, by his photo attached to the form, and read him the
instructions for I - 131 patients. After ensuring that he understood
she gave
him the capsule. At 9.05 am Drummond, an outpatient, took the capsule with a
glass of water and then went home. Ms Brooks
had not checked to see if the
prescribed dose was administered. 
<P>

6	At 9.10 am the Ms Brooks removed the label from the vial to attach to the
prescription form and saw a disagreement between the
prescription (200 MBq) and
the label (she read it as 600 MBq), she then phoned the licensee, Dr Michael
Carr, in Palmerston North.
Dr Carr consulted with the nuclear medicine
physician at PNH, Dr Kevin Smidt. Telephone contact was made with Richard Neale
of Alphatech,
the importer of the medicine and Peter Gene at PNH whereupon it
was realised that the activity was 6,000 MBq (not 600 MBq). Drummond
was
brought back to TBH immediately and was admitted to an isolation ward and
placed under the care of Dr Murray Hunt, the medical
officer at in oncology at
TBH.
<P>

7	Vomiting was induced, under the instruction of Dr Carr at 10.40 am,
approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes after administration.
885 mls of vomitus
was recovered. A 2 ml sample was measured to contain 11.25 MBq of I - 131
suggesting that about 5,000 MBq or 80%
of the dose had been recovered. A copy
of the standard nursing instructions used for the care of high-dose I - 131
patients at PNH
was faxed to TBH. At 1.00 pm thyroid blocking with a substance
known as Lugol's solution was initiated.   
<P>

8	On 10, 11, and 12 May 1994 Drummond remained at TBH in the isolation ward.
Except for some nausea caused by the Lugol's solution,
Drummond remained
physically well. On 13 May 1994 Drummond was discharged from TBH.
<P>

	<b>The orders Sought in this application</b>
<P>

9	ANSTO sought an order that it be granted an extension of time to bring the
application, such extension not being opposed by Counsel
for Drummond.  I make
that order granting extension of time to bring this application. 
<P>

10	ANSTO further seeks an order that the Court set aside the originating
process, or, in the alternative that this Court decline
in its discretion to
exercise its jurisdiction in the proceedings. The Applicant submits that the
matter presently before the Court
is not justiciable because the wrong that is
alleged to have occurred did not occur in New South Wales, but in New Zealand.

<P>

11	ANSTO also submitted that since the wrong occurred in New Zealand, Drummond
is not entitled to bring proceedings in New South
Wales as he is not entitled
to bring them in New Zealand under the choice of law rules which were set out
by the High Court by Brennan
J (as he then was) in <u>Breavington v.
Godleman</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20169%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 169 CLR 41</a> at pp. 110-111 which judgment was applied in
<u>McKain v. R.W. Miller &amp; Co (S.A.) Pty. Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 1</a> and
also by the majority in <u>Stevens v. Head</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 176 CLR 433</a>, holding at
p.433 that:
<P>

	"A Plaintiff may sue in the forum to enforce a liability in respect of a wrong
occurring outside the territory of the forum if
 
<P>

	1. the claim arises out of circumstances of such a character that, if they had
occurred within the territory of the forum, a cause
of action would have arisen
entitling the Plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of
the kind which the Plaintiff
claims to enforce; and by the law of the place in
which the wrong occurred, the circumstances of the occurrence give rise to a
civil
liability of the kind which the Plaintiff claims to enforce."
<P>

12	Before the choice of law rules can apply however, it is necessary to
determine whether the wrong occurred outside New South Wales,
namely in New
Zealand or whether the wrong occurred in New South Wales.
<P>

13	Drummond submitted that the wrong occurred in New South Wales, not in New
Zealand, that while the damage occurred in New Zealand,
the act on behalf of
ANSTO which gives Drummond his cause of complaint, took place in New South
Wales. This being the case, ANSTO
submitted that the tort is not a foreign
tort. In order to accept this submission it is necessary to determine where the
wrong actually
took place.
<P>

14	The correct test to determine where a tort has been committed is set out in
the Privy Council decision in <u>Distillers Co. (Biochemicals) Limited v.
Thompson</u>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20NSWLR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 NSWLR 83</a> which was confirmed by the High Court in
<u>Voth v. Manildra Flour Mills Pty. Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538</a> at 568. In
<u>Distillers Co. (Biochemicals) Limited v. Thompson</u> the Privy Council held
at p.90 that:
<P>

	"The right approach is, when the tort is complete, to look back over the
series of events constituting it and ask the question,
where in substance did
this cause of action arise?"
<P>

15	<u>Distillers</u> involved a purchase by an Australian company from an
English company of a pharmaceutical preparation, the drug thalidomide
manufactured
and packaged by the appellant, in England but marketed and sold in
Australia. The printed matter that accompanied the drug described
it as
harmless, safe and effective sedative with no side effects. The plaintiff, an
infant, was born with disabilities alleged to
be due to her mother having taken
the drug whilst pregnant. The plaintiff alleged the defendant was negligent in
that it failed to
warn the mother that the product would be dangerous if taken
during the first three months of pregnancy. The Supreme Court of New
South
Wales was asked to consider whether it had jurisdiction to entertain the
action. 
<P>

16	For the Court to have jurisdiction the plaintiff had to show that <i>"there
is a cause of action which arose within the jurisdiction"</i> within the
meaning of s.18(4) of the NSW Common Law Procedure Act 1899. Lord Pearson,
delivering the judgment of the Privy Council
in <u>Distellers'</u> referred at
p. 87 to three possible theories:
<P>

	"(i) that the `cause of action' must be the whole cause of action, so that
every part of it, every ingredient of it, must have
occurred within the
jurisdiction; (ii) that it is necessary and sufficient that the last ingredient
of the cause of action, the event
which completes a cause of action and brings
it into being, has occurred within the jurisdiction; and (iii) that the act on
the part
of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint must
have occurred within the jurisdiction."
<P>

17	After analysing each of the theories, Lord Pearson rejected the first and
second, finding theory (iii) 
<P>

	"inherently reasonable, as the defendant is called upon to answer for his
wrong in the courts of the country where he did the wrong."
<P>

18	As to theory (ii) Lord Pearson stated at p.89C;
<P>

	"The last event might happen in a particular case to be the determining factor
on its own merits, by reason of its inherent importance,
but not because it is
the last event...But when the question is which country's courts should have
jurisdiction to try the action,
the approach should be different: the search is
for the most appropriate court to try the action, and the degree of connection
between
the cause of action and the country concerned should be the determining
factor."
<P>

19	The Privy Council in <u>Distellers'</u> concluded that it was the omission
of the warning from either the packaging of the product or at the point of sale
to the consumer
which constituted the tort. The Privy Council further held that
the warning should have been communicated in New South Wales, thereby
giving
the necessary jurisdiction.
<P>

20	In <u>Castree v. E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%201248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR 1248</a>, a
decision involving a claim by a plaintiff for damages for personal injury
sustained in the course of her employment while using
a defective machine
manufactured in Germany, Ackner L.J, in determining whether the plaintiff had a
cause of action in an English
Court cited Lord Pearson's test in
<u>Distillers</u> with approval and concluded at p.1252 that:
<P>

	"...That which gave, or gives, the plaintiff her cause of complaint is not the
mere manufacture of the defective machinery, which
of course took place in
Germany; the mere manufacture of the defective machinery is not in my judgment
even the beginning of tort.
That manufacture might have been manufacture for
experimental purposes, or it might have been for the development of some part
of
the machinery. The substantial wrongdoing in this case alleged to have been
committed by the appellants is putting on the English
market a defective
machine with no warning as to its defects. That being, in my judgment, the
position, and applying the test which
is accepted on all sides to be the
appropriate test, namely, to look back over the series of events constituting
the tort and to
ask the question where in substance this cause of action arose,
I would conclude that it arose in this country."
<P>

21	In <u>D'Ath v. T.N.T Australia Pty Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%201%20Qd%20R%20369" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 1 Qld R. 369</a>, White M
following the substance test in <u>Distillers</u> held that the plaintiff whose
husband was killed when the car which he was driving was struck by a freighter
dog-trailer after the
drawbar had fractured on the trailer and the trailer had
broken from the truck had established jurisdiction despite the manufacturer
of
the drawbar being German. Master White held that jurisdiction was established
in respect of that part of the third party claim
which alleged the breach of a
positive duty arising at the point of sale within the jurisdiction to warn or
advise with respect to
safety chains or other devices and mode of installation
of the drawbar.
<P>

22	As indicated above, the decision in <u>Distillers</u> has also been
confirmed by the High Court in <u>Voth v. Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538</a> and followed by the Court of Appeal in England in <u>Metall
&amp; Rohstoff v. Donaldson Inc.</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%201%20QB%20391" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 1 QB 391</a>, the Courts applying in
both cases the test "where, in substance, did the cause of action arise." 
<P>

23	As Slade L.J. commented in <u>Metall &amp; Rohstoff v. Donaldson
Inc.</u>:
<P>

	"In our judgement, in double locality cases our court should first consider
whether, by reference exclusively to English law, it
can be properly said that
a tort has been committed within the jurisdiction of our courts. In answering
the question, they should
apply the now well familiar "substance" test
previously applied in such cases as Distillers Co. (Biochemicals) Limited v.
Thompson
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20NSWLR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 NSWLR 83</a>  Castree v. E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20WLR%201248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 WLR
1248</a> and Cordoba Shipping Co. Ltd v. National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 91.</a> If on the application of this test, they find that
the tort was in substance committed in this country, they can thenceforth
wholly
disregard the rule in Boys v. Chaplin  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 356</a>; the fact that some
of the relevant events occurred abroad will thenceforth have no bearing on the
Defendant's liability in tort.
On the other hand, if they find that the tort
was in substance committed in some foreign country, they should apply the rule
and
impose liability in tort under English law, only if both (a) the relevant
offence would have given rise to liability in tort in English
law if they had
all taken place in England, and (b) the alleged tort would be actionable in the
country where it was committed."
<P>

24	ANSTO argued cogently that the place of the wrong should be New Zealand
considering that the only act that took place in New
South Wales was the
incorrect affixing of address labels. ANSTO refer to Annexure "A" in the
Affidavit of Ivan Griscti sworn 4 November
1996, in particular at p.5 - the
section headed "What went wrong", as well as the  items listed 5 - 10 and
submit that every one
of those acts could have put an end to the initial
mis-labelling nullifying the incorrect affixing of  address labels.  
<P>

25	ANSTO sought to distinguish the present case from the facts in  <u>D'Ath v.
T.N.T Australia Pty Ltd,</u> submitting that in the present case the
radioactive material had not been sent over to New Zealand to be sold or
marketed, unlike
that in <u> D'Ath v. T.N.T Australia Pty Ltd,</u> but that the
material was designated to a particular hospital, for a particular patient, and
was precisely manufactured for this
patient. The patient, ANSTO submits was a
New Zealand resident who went to a New Zealand hospital to be treated. The only
fortuitous
thing was according to ANSTO the fact that that the material came
from Australia and was not manufactured in New Zealand. ANSTO submits
that for
those reasons the mere wrong addressing of labels in New South Wales was only
one factor and was not a sufficient factor
to say the tort took place in New
South Wales.
<P>

26	ANSTO submits that the test of the place of the last ingredient of the cause
of action, although rejected in <u>Distillers</u>, supra, is relevant to the
present case and neither fortuitous nor accidental, considering that the sale
of radioactive material
was specifically directed to New Zealand; that the
material was directed for the use of the hospitals concerned; and, it could
reasonably
be assumed, for this particular Plaintiff, in the case of one
package. ANSTO concludes therefore that when looking at the cause of
action
from the beginning to the end the wrong occurred could only be said to have
occurred in New Zealand.
<P>

27	Drummond submits that the wrong occurred in New South Wales, not in New
Zealand. Drummond submitted that the Court must look
at what the essential act
of the conduct complained about was, which Drummond contended was clearly the
mis-labelling of the vials
that occurred in New South Wales. The fact that
there were ten steps, all but the first occurring in New Zealand, therefore
amounting
to the conclusion that the tort must have been committed in New
Zealand, is, according to Drummond, an artificial way of putting
the matter.

<P>

28	Drummond contended that whilst there were a series of separate tortious
acts, there existed a duty of care by ANSTO to label
the medicine correctly,
and the damage that flowed from the mislabelling was entirely foreseeable.
Drummond submitted that this case
is not a negligent misrepresentation case,
there being no allegations in the pleadings of detrimental reliance by the
applicant.
 Drummond asserted that if the case is one involving negligent
misrepresentation would it wrongly assume that the primary duty of
ANSTO when
misdirecting the goods was to advise about their contents when in actual fact
ANSTO's duty was simply to direct the goods
to the correct place.
<P>

29	The facts of the present matter deal with a series of tortious acts. This
series of acts consisted first of the incorrect typing
of the address labels in
New South Wales; the failure by cargo handling at Sydney Airport and Auckland
Airport to identify an inconsistency
between the dangerous goods form and the
activity on the package label; the failure by the courier freighting the
packages to PNH
and TBH to notice the inconstancies; the failure to note the
activity being heavier than normal when opened and removed from its
container
at TBH; the mis-reading of the measured activity by the technologist at TBH and
her failure to check the activity prescribed
against the activity administered;
the failure to treat Drummond with appropriate urgency cause by the mis-reading
of the measure
of activity (which was thought to be 600 MBq but was really
6,000 MBq and therefore the failure to administer proper medical attention
(vomiting should have been induced much sooner, or a stomach pump should have
been used which would have been more effective and
would have allowed the
administration of stabilising agent, iodine, much earlier.
<P>

30	In <u>Mahoney v. J. Kruschich</u> at 522, the majority (Gibbs CJ, Mason,
Wilson, Brennan and Deane JJ) at p.528 stated the following in relation to who
is liable,
where a series of torts have been committed:
<P>

	"A negligent tortfeasor does not always avoid liability for the consequences
of a plaintiff's subsequent injury, even if the subsequent
injury is tortiously
inflicted. It depends on whether or not the subsequent tort and its
consequences are themselves properly to
be regarded as foreseeable consequences
of the first tortfeasor's negligence. A line marking the boundary of the damage
for which
a tortfeasor is liable in negligence may be drawn either because the
relevant injury is not reasonably foreseeable or because the
chain of causation
is broken by a novus actus interveniens: M'Kew v. Holland &amp; Hannen &amp;
Cubitts. But it must be possible
to draw such a line clearly before a liability
for damage that would not have occurred but for the wrongful act or omission of
a
tortfeasor and second tortfeasor's negligence alone: see Chapman v. Hearse.
Whether such a line can be drawn is a matter of fact
and degree." 
<P>

31	However the decision went on to hold that minds may differ as to whether a
subsequent injury was foreseeable or too remote to
be regarded as a consequence
for which an earlier tortfeasor may be liable. It was also held that an
exacerbation such as caused
by medical treatment may easily be regarded as
foreseeable, applying the law of the workers compensation cases that a
compensible
injury when exacerbated by medical treatment is to be treated to
the original accident.

32	Subsequent to the hearing of this application the NSW Court of Appeal in
<u>James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Putt</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 554</a> held that
although s.17 of the <i>Accident Rehabilitation Compensation Insurance Act</i>
1992 of New Zealand, being an amendment to the legislation which establishes
the New Zealand no fault liability scheme, in form,
bars an action to enforce a
right to damages. It's effect is to substitute cover under the statute for the
right to recover common
law damages and it is therefore a substantive not a
procedural law (p.579B and 585D). That case involved an action against a parent
company in respect of an injury sustained by an employee of a New Zealand
subsidiary of the Australian parent company. The Court
held in that case where
manufacturing occurred in New South Wales that to provide a safe system of
work, the place of the tort would
have been the foreign jurisdiction, where the
warning would have operated to protect the employees and the system of work
should
have been safe.
<P>

33	 <u>Putt</u> was applied in <u>James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Grigor</u>
(NSW Court of Appeal, unreported 18 June 1998) in which the plaintiff was
exposed to asbestos dust where there had been a failure
to warn him of the
danger of that dust. Both decisions were to the effect that it was in New
Zealand where the plaintiff suffered
the injury and it was in New Zealand that
there was a failure to warn. 
<P>

34	ANSTO submitted that, of the items listed in the evidence of Ivan Griscti of
4 November 1996, there is set out a series of tortious
acts of which the last
six occurred in New Zealand. It is submitted by ANSTO that the James Hardie
decisions of the Court of Appeal
are binding in the present case which
submission is conceded by Counsel for Drummond. It is put to the Court however,
by Dr Renwick,
Counsel for Drummond, that the findings of the Court of Appeal
in <u>Putt</u> and <u>Grigor</u> are wrong, but accepts that the Court is bound
by the decision. It seems to me that the in circumstances of the present case,
the
nature of the tortious acts which occurred in New Zealand as against those
which occurred in New South Wales more clearly demonstrate
that the tort
occurred in New Zealand, applying the "substance" of the tort test in
Distillers' to the number of separate events
which were particularised by
Drummond  show the tort to have occurred in New Zealand. ANSTO was supplying
the hospitals not Drummond.
<P>

35	ANSTO submitted that the majority judgment on this issue in <u>Grigor</u>
has no relevance, citing Mason P at p.20;
<P>

	"This case is distinguishable from James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Limited v. Putt,
Court of Appeal unreported, 27 May, 1998, in that
there is evidence that the
plaintiff may not be barred by the Accident Compensation Rehabilitation &amp;
Insurance Act, 1982 (NZ)
if he establishes actionable negligence occurring
before 1974. That distinction is significant to me in the balancing exercise
that
needs to be performed, albeit that the Court is not ultimately concerned
with the substantive rights of the parties as distinct from
the appropriateness
of litigating in the chosen forum"
<P>

	and it is submitted that no such possibility arose in the present case.
<u>Grigor</u> related to the issue of when injury commences by the inhalation
of asbestos in a death as a result of mesothelione. 
<P>

36	ANSTO also cites Mason P at p.21;
<P>

	  "With some hesitation, I regard <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ddta1989243/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ddta1989243/" class="autolink_findacts">Dust Diseases Tribunal
Act, 1989</a> as offering more than a mere legitimate personal or juridical
advantage to the plaintiff...The potential savings of time and cost
offered by
this provision are significant, even if used with proper circumspection and
close attention to the Defendant's right to
insist on clear prior indication of
the particular use to be made of the voluminous <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ddta1989243/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25(3)</a> material that is
often tendered. So long as the power is fairly used it cannot, in my opinion,
be viewed as a source of prejudice
to one party over another. Since <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ddta1989243/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
25(3)</a> is a matter of procedure, it is, I consider, appropriate to take into
account in focusing on <i>"the advantages arising from the continuation of the
proceedings in the selected forum"</i> (which is acceptable: <i>Voth</i> at
559. See also at 571) while avoiding <i>"assessment of the comparative
procedure or other claims of the foreign forum</i> (which is not: ibid)." 
<P>

37	It is submitted on behalf of ANSTO that there is nothing to make
<u>Grigor</u> relevant in the current proceedings.
<P>

38	It is put on behalf of Drummond that there is a distinction to be drawn
between <u>Putt</u> and <u>Grigor</u>, these proceedings. It is argued on
behalf of Drummond that the particulars of negligence and breach of duty of
care pleaded in the
statement of claim, to which there is no defence filed,
took place in New South Wales. Drummond asserted that ANSTO's characterisation
of these proceedings as negligent failure to warn assumes that the primary duty
of ANSTO when misdirecting goods was to advise as
to their contents. Counsel
for Drummond submitted that ANSTO was to direct the specific goods of the
patient on whose specific part
they had been sought.  
<P>

39	I accept the submission of ANSTO in relation to Grigor. Those circumstances
do not apply here.
<P>

40	In my view the wrongful act of administration occurred, on the pleadings, in
New Zealand. It was the system in New Zealand which
caused the injury to
Drummond. The tort therefore occurred in New Zealand and the plaintiff is
barred effectively, as a matter of
substantive law from bringing proceedings in
New Zealand and thus fails the second test in Breavington and thus is precluded
from
bringing proceedings for tort for general damages in this State. 
<P>

41	In my view the proper exercise of jurisdiction by the Court is, since
Drummond has come into this jurisdiction, is to stay the
proceedings in so far
as there is a claim for general damages. 
<P>

42	There remains, however, one other issue of damages. In his submissions, Dr
Renwick for Drummond submitted that exemplary damages
were not precluded and
that the New Zealand legislation only applies as to general damages. Although
his submission was put to the
Court in terms of "exemplary damages" I note that
the Statement of Claim does not refer to exemplary damages but refers to
"aggravated
compensatory damages". It has not been argued before me and I do
not decide the issue of whether there is any distinction to be drawn
for these
purposes between aggravated and exemplary damages. It may be that aggravated
damages are subsumed into a general damages
claim and that exemplary damages
are not, but it appears on the evidence before me that there is no bar to a
bringing of a claim
for other than general damages. There was admitted before
me the evidence of Linton Lawrence Stevens of 12 February 1997 omitting
paragraphs 6(b), 24,25, 26, the last two sentences of paragraph 30 and the
third last sentence in paragraph 31 and paragraph 22 was
to be taken as a
submission. That evidence as to New Zealand law, which I accept, restricts
actions seeking "damages or compensation".
I also, in relation to exemplary
damages, accept the evidence of Colin William Bright admitted before me that
the New Zealand legislation
does not prevent a person from issuing proceedings
seeking exemplary damages, although the matter is yet to be clarified by the
New
Zealand courts. Mr Bright makes the comment that he doesn't consider the
report which was furnished to him revealed a basis for a
successful claim for
exemplary damages against the defendant. I make no finding in relation to that
matter although it appears that
the acts relied on fall somewhat short of than
what would normally be a basis for exemplary damages.
<P>

43	In the light of the orders that I propose to make it is not necessary for me
to make any comment as to the submissions on forum
non-conveniens.
<P>

44	The orders therefore that I make are as follows;
<P>

1. 	That ANSTO be granted an extension of time to bring this application.
<P>

2. 	I stay these proceedings to the extent that the proceedings claim general
damages against ANSTO.
<P>

3. 	I order that Drummond pay ANSTO's costs of these proceedings.
