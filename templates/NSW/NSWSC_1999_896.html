<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The prisoner, David Jason Hooker, was
committed to this Court for trial on a large number of counts.  The Crown first
presented
an indictment on 23 June 1999, the prisoner pleaded guilty to certain
of the counts and the Crown accepted his pleas in discharge
of the indictment.
On 27 August 1999 the Crown presented a second indictment which superseded the
first and accepted in discharge
the pleas the prisoner then entered.  In the
circumstances it is proper to regard the prisoner as having pleaded guilty at
the first
opportunity.  The offences of which he now stands convicted are as
follows -
<P>

On 9 March 1998 at Marrickville he murdered Duc Hoang Do;
<P>

At the same time and place he robbed Toan Van Doan of certain property and at
the same time used corporal violence upon him, occasioning
him grievous bodily
harm; and
<P>

At the same time and place he robbed Cong Hai Nguyen of certain property and at
the same time used corporal violence upon him.
<P>

2  	On 9 March 1998 the prisoner, who was addicted to the use of
heroin and other drugs, went with six other young men or youths
to a flat in
Marrickville.  They had bought heroin there before and intended to do so on
this occasion.  They arrived there some
time after 10pm.  The prisoner had
already consumed drugs on that day.  Between about 1pm and 5pm he had taken
between seven and
nine serepax pills and between 5pm and about 9.30pm had taken
heroin.
<P>

3  	When they arrived at the premises there were two men there, Cong
Hai Nguyen and Duc Hoang Do.  The young men purchased heroin
from Cong Hai
Nguyen and sat in the lounge smoking it.  In the meantime Cong Hai Nguyen and
Duc Hoang Do prepared or ate a meal in
the kitchen.
<P>

4  	One of the visitors suggested that they rob the two men of their
money and drugs.  Although there was an initial reluctance
on the part two or
more of them, including the prisoner, they all joined in the attack which
followed.  Duc Hoang Do walked into
the room where they were and was
immediately set upon and punched and kicked by a number of people.  They left
him apparently unconscious
and bleeding in the corner of the room.
<P>

5  	Cong Hai Nguyen entered the room and they attacked him, kicking
and punching him in the face and the head.  They threatened
to kill him and
tore his clothes.  They stole his wallet but he managed to run out of the flat
and escape.
<P>

6  	The prisoner went into a bedroom looking for money and drugs.  As
he searched he found a knife under a chair and picked it up.
 During the
assault on Cong Hai Nguyen a third man, Toan Van Doan, had entered the flat,
unaware of what was happening.  They set
upon him as well and threw him into
the bedroom where the prisoner was.  The prisoner struck him on the head with
the knife.  While
that was going on the others were removing property from the
flat and loading it into the car.  As the prisoner came out of the bedroom
Duc
Hoang Do, who was recovering and trying to get off the floor, screamed at the
prisoner and threatened him.  He was in no position
to do him harm, of course,
but he threatened to take revenge.  At that, the prisoner walked over to him
and stabbed him three times
in the chest.  The knife used was a large, heavy
one.
<P>

7  	The prisoner and the others got away in the car.
<P>

8  	Duc Hoang Do died of his wounds.  He sustained three stab wounds
to the chest and blunt force head injuries.  The longest wound
was 210mm deep
and perforated the heart.  The lungs, liver and diaphragm were also
perforated.
<P>

9  	Toan Van Doan sustained a serious head injury.  He was kept in
hospital for the next six days.  The repair of the head wound
required
thirty-four stitches and he had to have an operation to remove a blood clot
from the brain.  There is no evidence of any
continuing disability and it is to
be assumed that he has recovered from his injuries.
<P>

10  	The prisoner was arrested, taken to police premises and formally
interviewed.  He admitted going to the premises with the other
people and gave
the police a version of what happened which is substantially the same as the
one I have related.  He admitted that
he remembered hitting the man on the head
in the bedroom but said that he had no recollection of stabbing the second man.
He admitted
that he must have done so, however, because he remembered having
the knife and because his colleagues had told him that he had stabbed
the
man.
<P>

11  	I accept the opinion of Dr Westmore that the prisoner's
inability to recall exactly what happened is genuine and probably results
from
the combined effect of the drugs he had taken and the difficulty he has had
coming to terms with what he has done.
<P>

12  	The offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced are very
serious indeed.  One man was killed, another was badly hurt.
 Substantial
quantities of goods and money were taken under violence and threats of
violence.  The first count carries a maximum
sentence of penal servitude for
life, the second twenty-five years' penal servitude and the third twenty years'
penal servitude.
<P>

13  	There are important features, however, which mitigate the
criminality of the prisoner.  I am satisfied that he did not go to
the flat
with intent to attack or rob.  He took no weapon.  The attack was suggested by
another member of the group and I think that
he responded partly because of the
pressure of his friends and partly because the effect upon him of the drugs he
had consumed made
it difficult for him to resist.
<P>

14  	He admitted his involvement as soon as the police spoke to him.
Without his admissions and his pleas of guilty the Crown would
have had a weak
case.  The Crown informed the Court that it was doubtful whether the two
surviving victims would have been available
to give evidence.
<P>

15  	The prisoner was born on 6 November 1980.  He had a difficult
childhood.  His father beat him severely over a period of years
and the
household was unhappy.  An uncle sexually abused him.  It may have been because
of his resentment of his father that he began
when he was thirteen years old to
commit crime and to experiment with illegal drugs.  By the time he was fourteen
he had become dependent
on heroin.  By the age of seventeen he was using more
than one gram per day, costing between $500 and $600.  Of course, he was
committing
crimes to raise the money he had to have.  He began offending in
1995 and has a record of stealing from the person, stealing motor
vehicles,
possessing implements, robbery in company and other offences of violence as
well as motor vehicle offences.  He was given
the benefit of community service
orders, but reported poorly and breached the conditions of them, and of control
orders to which
he was later made subject.
<P>

16  	The prisoner has been in detention since the date of his arrest,
namely 8 April 1998.  He has no psychiatric illness, is of
average intelligence
and has the ability of an adult to read and comprehend.
<P>

17  	He has a girlfriend with whom he was living at the time of his
arrest and they have a young child.  His family and his girlfriend
are
supporting him.
<P>

18  	He feels guilty about putting his family through the ordeal of
their suffering.  Although his family wanted him to plead not
guilty, he wanted
to recognise his involvement by pleading guilty.  Although he finds it
difficult to demonstrate remorse, I think
that his action in entering his pleas
shows that he is sorry for the pain he has inflicted on others.
<P>

19  	Notwithstanding the efforts of those who are supervising him, he
resists autonomy, thinks little of himself and mistrusts others.
 According to
a psychologist, Mr Harry Smith, who prepared a report for the Court, the
prisoner may have trouble sustaining or even
beginning a consistent therapeutic
relationship.  His hypersensitivity, gloomy outlook and self-demeaning comments
intensify his
anguish about the past, the present and the future.  He is in
need of long-term therapy.  Mr Smith considers that he has not closed
the door
completely to help, however.
<P>

20  	In spite of his lack of trust in himself and others, however,
reports from the officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice
show that the
prisoner is taking tentative steps towards rehabilitation.  He is well
respected by those who have the charge of him.
<P>

21  	Since his arrest the prisoner has been taking part in a program
of study supervised by officials of the Department.  He is
working towards
completing his Year 10 School Certificate, something he was denied when
expelled from his last high school.  His
executive teacher speaks highly of his
motivation and efforts to continue his education in custody.  He thinks that
the prisoner's
attitude during the months after enrolment has improved
considerably.  He is taking a lot of pride in his work and is one of the
best
students in the course.  He has also completed a number of TAFE outreach
courses in conjunction with his Year 10 studies.  They
concentrate on
practical, trade work, something to which the prisoner seems well suited.
<P>

22  	During recent riots at the Juvenile Justice Centre where he was
being held he assisted the authorities to bring a dangerous
state of affairs to
a safe and satisfactory conclusion.
<P>

23  	I think that these are signs that the prisoner may gain
confidence in himself and others and I accept the opinion of Mr Smith
that he
should be given the opportunity to continue to take advantage of the juvenile
justice system until he is twenty-one years
old.
<P>

24  	It is difficult to come to a conclusion whether the prisoner
will offend again after his release into the community.  Dr Westmore
held out
some hope that the violence the prisoner engaged in was perhaps out of
character because he told Dr Westmore that he was
not normally violent.
However, the prisoner had by then been found to have committed two robberies.
Dr Westmore thought that the
aggression occurred in the context of his
antisocial personality traits, resulting from his violent childhood and from
his substance
abuse.
<P>

25  	I think that there are modest prospects that the prisoner will
not offend again if he takes advantage of the opportunities
that will be
offered him in the juvenile justice system and, later on, when he is in the
adult correctional system and on probation.
<P>

26  	The prisoner was seventeen years and four months old at the time
of these offences.  He is therefore entitled to consideration
on account of his
age.
<P>

27  	In sentencing young people, the consideration of general
deterrence is not as important as in sentencing adults because for
young people
considerations of rehabilitation have to be given prominence.  However,
deterrence and retribution do not cease to be
significant merely because the
people to be sentenced are in their late teens.  When the offence calling for
sentence is a grave
crime of violence frequently committed by people of such
age the need to protect the public against such crimes must be kept in mind.
Unfortunately, serious assaults and robberies by groups of teenagers are not
uncommon in our society.
<P>

28  	Of the prisoner's six companions, only two have been dealt with,
and both in the Children's Court.  One, who was ten months
younger than the
prisoner, pleaded guilty to a single count of robbery in company and was
ordered to serve one year's probation,
allowance having been made for five
months' pre-sentence detention.  The other, who was four months younger than
the prisoner, pleaded
guilty to two counts of aggravated robbery with corporal
violence and was ordered to serve eighteen months, probation and made subject
to a conditional control order for nine months.  Because of the difference
between the criminality of those offenders and that of
the prisoner and because
they were dealt with under a different sentencing regime and because I know
nothing of the backgrounds or
any criminal antecedents of those offenders, I
find those sentences of no assistance in determining the sentences to be
imposed upon
the prisoner.
<P>

29  	The sentence I impose for each offence will take account of the
criminal conduct on which the relevant count is based.  At
the same time, the
overall sentence will be proportionate to my assessment of the prisoner's total
criminality.
<P>

30  	Because all the offences were committed within a single short
episode of misconduct, the prisoner is entitled to expect a degree
of
concurrency.  However, because his total criminality exceeds that of the most
serious offence, there must also be a degree of
accumulation.
<P>

31  	The fact of accumulation and the special needs of the prisoner
for an extended period in the community under supervision in
order to promote
his rehabilitation produce the need for an additional term for the first count
which exceeds one-third of the minimum
term.  The same need to structure an
overall sentence which accords with the totality of the prisoner's criminality
but makes proper
provision for his rehabilitation also produces the need to fix
an additional term on the second count which exceeds one-third of
the minimum
term and to impose a fixed term on the third count.
<P>

32  	For the offence of robbing Cong Hai Nguyen and using corporal
violence upon him the prisoner is sentenced to penal servitude
for a fixed term
of three years, commencing on 8 April 1998 and expiring on 7 April 2001.
<P>

33  	For the offence of robbing Toan Van Doan and using corporal
violence upon him occasioning him grievous bodily harm the prisoner
is
sentenced to penal servitude for five years, comprising a minimum term of three
years commencing on 8 April 1998 and expiring
on 7 April 2001 and an additional
term of two years.
<P>

34  	For the offence of the murder of Duc Hoang Do the prisoner is
sentenced to penal servitude for thirteen years comprising a
minimum term of
seven years commencing on 8 April 2001 and expiring on 7 April 2008 and an
additional term of six years commencing
on 8 April 2008 and expiring on 7 April
2014.
<P>

35  	The prisoner will be eligible for release on parole on 7 April
2008.
<P>

36  	I direct that until he is twenty-one years of age the prisoner
serve his sentences in a detention centre.
