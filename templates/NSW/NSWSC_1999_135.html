2216/95- WILLIAM WALKER FRANCIS MCGRATH v
<P>

GRAHAM JOHN WALKER AND 2 ORS
<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

 
<P>

1	MASTER: This is an application under the Family Provisions Act in respect of
the estate of  the late Violet Elizabeth McGrath
who died 22 November 1993 aged
69.  The deceased was survived by her widower, the plaintiff in the action, her
sons and several grandchildren.
Under her will which was made on 4 August 1984
the deceased appointed her son the first defendant as executor and gave the
whole
of her estate to be held equally between her husband, the plaintiff, her
son Graham, the defendant, and her grandsons, Adam and Scott
who were the
second and third defendants respectfully.
<P>

2	     There has been adduced no evidence before me as to why the plaintiff may
have made such a provision.  The evidence is simply
silent on the matter. The
estate of the deceased is compromised of a modest property, 35 Hollingsworth
Street, Port Macquarie, which
has a value of approximately $100,000. There were
some small amounts in bank accounts and after payment of administration
expenses
the amount left is sum of $6452.80.
<P>

3	     The costs incurred today, so far on the plaintiffs part are $8432.90.
The defendant part $9,001.20. Although the second and
third defendant's cost
amount to $9822.00 the second and third defendant made it plain at the
commencement of the proceedings they
are not seeking any costs orders and
accordingly they clearly happy to bear those costs.
<P>

4	     The plaintiff and the deceased were married on 10 January 1946.  Prior
to that the plaintiff had served in the AIF during
the Second World War and was
discharged medically unfit from the Army in 1945 the result of some
psychological problems, osteo-arthritis
and possible heart disease.  They had
one child, Graham, the defendant.  The plaintiff apparently was well enough to
be able to do
some work as a truck driver and taxi driver and cleaner.
Although he seemed to cease work in 1960 and lived on the invalid pension.
In
1962 he had a heart attack and apparently there has been no recurrence of
that.
<P>

5	     He and his wife initially lived in rental accommodation.  In the 1970's
the deceased's mother died leaving some money to
her. That money was used to
purchase a house in July 1975 in Grafton in the joint names of the deceased and
the plaintiff. The January
1979 property which was the property remaining in
the estate was purchased in the name of the deceased. The purchase price of
$28,500
was financed by $10,500.00 being savings of the deceased and the
plaintiff and an $18,000 loan. Apparently it was purchased in the
deceased name
as both parties expected that the plaintiff would predecease her.
<P>

6	In 1980 they moved from Grafton to live in the Port Macquarie house and this
was after some fairly extensive renovations which
were carried out by the
plaintiff on the property at Port Macquarie. I will not go through them in
detail but they are set out in
paragraph 18 of his principal affidavit. And in
paragraph 19 he details some other matters which he attended to on the house.
Grafton
was sold in May 1980. Part of the sale proceeds were used pay off the
debt for Port Macquarie.
<P>

7	     The parties have lived there since that time and the plaintiff still
lives there. Effectively. They have been married some
48 years at the date of
death of the deceased on 22 November 1993.
<P>

8	     In application under the Family Provisions Act to the High Court
recently in Singer and Berghouse<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>; , <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1994%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1994 (181) CLR 201</a> 1 set out the two  stage
approach that the court must take.  At page 209 it said the following:
<P>

	     " The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the
applicant inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance,
education and
advancement in life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between
'adequate provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in Bosh v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited.  The
determination of the
first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was inadequate or what, in
all
of the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate
for the applicant having regard, amongst  other things,
to the applicants
financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality
of the relationship between the
applicant and the deceased, and the
relationship between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims
upon his or her
bounty.
<P>

	     The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the
process, the court may need
to arrive at an assessment or what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision
in which event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which
a court could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for
proper maintenance  Take, for example, a case
like Ellis v Leeder where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably
be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements to pay creditors."
<P>

9	     As is apparent from what is said, it is necessary to consider the
position of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff is aged either
73 or 74 years of age
and he has an income from a totally permanent incapacity pension of $1029,80
per fortnight.  He has expenses.
 However he is able to save from his pension
and for instance he has increased  his savings a little bit under a thousand
dollars
over the last year. As far as his medical condition is concerned
clearly he had sufficient incapacity to justify the grant of a pension.
 He had
a heart attack in 1962 and he has not referred to any other problems since
then.  He appears in the witness box to be a person
who is still able to move
about comfortably and nothing was suggested in cross-examination to dispel that
impression. As far as his
financial circumstance are concerned leaving aside
his interest he takes under the will of his late wife he has a land Cruiser
worth
about $8,000, cash of about $6,000, boat and trailer worth $2,000, and
some tools and furniture which he estimates has a value of
$17,000.  He has as
I have mentioned been increasing his savings and the purpose of that has been
to pay the cost of these proceedings
<P>

10	     When one looks at the position of the first defendant one comes across
the split that has occurred in this family. The first
defendant quite properly
in my view supports his fathers application.  He asked his sons to also agree
shortly after his mother's
death that his father, the plaintiff in the action,
could have the house absolutely.  This was initially agreed to although shortly
afterwards the second and third defendants changed their minds. Accordingly the
first defendant's his financial situation is quite
irrelevant.  He wishes to
see his father have the whole property. That of course, as has been pointed out
in submissions will ultimately
work to his benefit as he is the one who will
benefit from his fathers will.  But he is giving something up at this stage.
<P>

11	     The second defendant is a grandson of the deceased. Adam is a senior
constable with the New South Wales police force and
is married with three
children.  They are young children aged approximately four and below.  He
deposed to his assets situation in
his affidavit of 28 April 1988. That was not
updated when he gave evidence in chief and a somewhat different picture emerged
in cross-examination.
He as a senior constable has a salary gross amount of
$46,400 and he gets shift allowances of between two and three thousand dollars
per annum. He and his wife reside in a home at 14 Russel Street, Vaucluse which
is owned by his wife's father.  And they own some
furniture and he has a
Commodore sedan valued at $44,500.  To acquire that his wife lent him $30,000
dollars approximately which
he used with a trade in of his own vehicle to
purchase that vehicle.
<P>

12	     It is apparent from cross-examination that his wife is a lady of some
substance. She apparently owns 9 properties and indeed
has five units in one
block of six.  Those no doubt are income producing and given the other matters
which I am about to refer to
I think it is reasonable to infer that she has
substantial income. Adam gave evidence that his wife substantially met their
household
expenses from this income. She recently gave him $65,000 so he could
buy an investment property at Maroubra.  He purchased that for
$275,000 with a
loan of $220,000. 
<P>

13		Looking at his situation over all, he is married, has been  together with
his wife for some years, they have three young children.
 There is no reason
why that relationship is not likely to continue.  Clearly his wife is person of
some substance.
<P>

14	     As far as Scott is concerned his situation is quite different. Scott
was born on 17 June 1977 and is the younger son. He
left school after obtaining
the school certificate in 1992. After a series of casual jobs he recently
obtained permanent employment
and is now in permanent employment with David
Jones.  He is now married and earns 330 dollars per week and his wife also
apparently
earns some similar amount. They live in rented accommodation for
which they pay $190 per week. The furniture belongs to his wife
and there is
little else of great substance which he or his wife have. However, they do not
have the responsibility yet, of a family.
 They are young and have their life
before them.
<P>

15	     It is of course necessary for a plaintiff who comes to this court to
establish that he has been left without adequate or
proper provision for his
maintenance, education and advancement in life.  Unless that is established the
court cannot make an order.
This court does not make orders to  readjust wills
to make what someone might think would be a fair provision. Accordingly it is
necessary to see what way the plaintiff might have been left without adequate
and proper provision.  Clearly as far as income is
concerned the plaintiff has
sufficient income to meet his needs as he is secure with the provision of his
pension.
<P>

16	     As far as other matters which would normally be expected there is the
question of his accommodation and also the question
of whether he ought to have
some fund for the contingencies in life which might come upon him given his
age. Widows claims are frequently
the subject of application in this court. The
Court of Appeal in Goloski and Goloski unreported (5 October 1993) referred to
formulation
of that standard to be expected for a widow in terms which refer to
the decision of Powell J and Luciano v Rosenblum  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65</a> and Elliot
and Elliot it was approved by the Court of Appeal on 24 April  1986.  There the
court said:
<P>

	     "Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and
harmonious, where the widow has loyally supported her husband
and assisted him
to build up and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his
widow can be no less than to the extent
to which his assets permit him to
achieve that result; first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for
the rest of her life
and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her
she have the capacity to change her home; secondly that she have available
to
her and income sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of
comfort and free from financial worry; and third, that
she have available to
her a fund to which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such
modest luxuries as she might
choose and which would provide her with a hedge
against any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring."
<P>

17	     This of course was the widow's application and the principles which I
have just quoted in respect of widow's applications
apply with equal force for
a widower's application.  In particular in this case there has been a  long
relationship, 42 years, and
very clearly the plaintiff has contributed to and
helped build up the assets which is now all that survives of that long
relationship.
 There is nothing to suggest the relationship was unhappy and
accordingly one would ordinarily expect that those three major matters
should
be addressed.  One of them is addressed by the provision of the pension. The
case is unusual in one sense, in that apart from
some short evidence given in
cross-examination in which Scott said he lived with his grandparents for two
and a half months, there
is absolutely no evidence that Adam did.  There is
also no evidence of any family contact between the grandparents and the
grandchildren.
<P>

18	     There can be no suggestion from what evidence I have seen that the
grandchildren contributed to the estate which has been
substantially
contributed to by the plaintiff and the deceased. The only submission of
substance that is made on behalf of the second
and third defendants is that the
appropriate order that the court could make would be that there should be some
life estate given
to the plaintiff.
<P>

19	     The plaintiff has a life expectancy of some 11 or 12 years depending on
his precise age.  In this regard I am mindful of
what was said by the High
Court in White v Baron <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1924/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%2d1980%29%20144%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979-1980) 144 CLR 431.</a>  At page 444 the court said
that:
<P>

	     "A capital provision should only be awarded to a widow when it appears
that this is the fairest means of securing her proper
maintenance.   However,
the provision of a large capital sum for a widow who is not young, may in the
event
<P>

	of her early death, result in a substantial benefit to her relatives, contrary
to the wishes of the testator, when a benefit of
another kind would have
afforded an adequate safeguard to her personally, without leaving her in a
position in which she could benefit
her relatives from the proceeds of the
legacy."
<P>

20	     However even bearing that in mind there are a number of other cases
where the courts have talked about the unsuitability
of such provisions.  For
instance in a case which was referred to in argument, The Court v Hunt, the
decision of Young J, (unreported),
14 December 1987, his Honour said:
<P>

	     "Old age is a growing problem in our community and judges who sit in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> applications get experience as well as their own
experience in the community, as to what happens when people reach the age when
they
can no longer look after themselves and one judges the evidence in these
sort of proceedings against that background knowledge."
<P>

21	     His Honour went on to talk about the assumptions and referred to the
fact that in many case these days a life estate would
not be sufficient because
it does not cover the situation of the plaintiff moving from her own home to a
retirement home to hospital.
 He said:
<P>

	     "Sometimes it is possible for  a court to order a more flexible
non-capital provision such as was done by Holland J in Crisp
v  Burns Philp
Trustee Co Ltd,  Service at page 13206.  Other times the proper provision is
for a fee simple give, realising that
this property will be sold and will be
turned over into the appropriate property to maintain the widow for the rest of
her life.
Care also has to be given by those administering the plaintiff's
property to ensure
<P>

	 that there is sufficient income being raised after tax that will provide for
maintenance levies and other payments that have to
be made by the widow."
<P>

22		At times the Court of Appeal has also referred to undesirability of giving
life estates.  In Goloski v Goloski unreported, 5
October 1993, the Court
summarised principles of widows applications and included was this
statement:
<P>

	     " A mere right of residence will usually be an unsatisfactory method of
providing for a spouse's accommodation to fulfil the
foregoing normal
presupposition.   This is because a spouse may be compelled by sickness, age,
urgent supervening necessity or otherwise,
with good reason, to leave the
residence.  The spouse provided and will then be left without the kind of
protection which is normally
expected will be provided by a testator who is
both wise and just.  See Moore v Moore, Court of Appeal, unreported, 16 May
1984,
per
<P>

	Hutley JA."
<P>

23	     The matter that concerns me is that in this case I do not think one
really needs to get to a consideration of whether or
not it is appropriate to
consider a life interest. There are a number of factors which lead to this
result.  One is that the estate
has small if any cash which may well be used by
expenses and costs.  And the second more important matter is that on the
evidence
there is no claim on the testator's bounty by second and third
defendants. Admittedly the second and third defendants come here as
beneficiaries who are named in the will.  However the court has to consider the
relationship between not only the deceased and the
person making the
application but also the relationship with the person who take a benefit under
the will.
<P>

24	     As I have earlier demonstrated, apart from living there for two and a
half months, in the case of Scott there has, in fact,
been nothing referred to
in the evidence dealing with any matters which would tend to show some claim on
the bounty of the deceased.
In Gorton v Parks there is passage by His Honour
Justice Bryson when he refers to the mere fact of paternity being of
significance.
His Honour's context was in a case dealing with children and
sometimes in this jurisdiction people are better to rely on that fact
as matter
which is appropriate to support a claim by a child. However, the mere fact of
paternity in my view in the case of grandchildren
does not in any way establish
any claim on the bounty of a testator and this is particularly so where there
is a widower, a son and
a small estate.
<P>

25		Even if I were wrong in this conclusion in my view it would still not be
appropriate to grant some life estate to the plaintiff.
 The plaintiff although
having past illnesses does not have any current matters which seem to be
threatening his health.  He has
an 11 year life expectancy.  Even though it is
expressed briefly in his affidavit he is concerned about his security and it is
a
worry to him.
<P>

26	     The fact that the second and third defendant in evidence expressed that
they had all been prepared to let him live there
until he dies really does not
address the problem.  The problem is for the person who has lived the whole of
his 46  married years
in one house to have control of that house to be able to
do as he wishes, and not be at the beck and call or dependant upon the good
graces and favours of someone else. In my view it would be quite inappropriate
in this case to grant a life estate
<P>

27	     Accordingly I order that in lieu of the provisions of the will in
favour of the parties that the whole of the estate pass
to the plaintiff.
<P>

28	  I have heard argument about costs in this matter.  The plaintiff seeks
that the second and third defendant pay the costs of
the plaintiff on an
indemnity basis.  The executor, the first defendant, also seeks a similar order
from the second and third defendant.
<P>

29	     The matter is one where the evidence in chief of the plaintiff was
completed in July 1998.  The only evidence put on by
the second and third
defendant was completed in April 1998.  There apparently was an unsuccessful
mediation on 24 June 1998, and
after that on 17th of September 1998 one has
consent orders which were the orders that Scott McGrath be joined as the third
defendant.
<P>

30	     Certain other motions were compromised and there was then a direction
that the second and third defendants were to file
further affidavit evidence on
which they intended to rely on or before 24 September 1998.  No such affidavits
were filed or relied
upon. There is some correspondence in September in which a
claim for costs if the plaintiff is successful is foreshadowed with no
mention
made of cost being claimed on an indemnity basis.  
<P>

31		Frequently one finds in matters of this nature that there are circumstance
in which unsuccessful plaintiff's costs can be met
where the deceased has
misled people.  However that is not this piece of litigation. Prima facie, this
piece of litigation is contested
inter-parties litigation between son and
father on one side, and grandchildren on the other.  In all civil litigation
when one party
loses, the prima facie result is that the party who loses pays
the costs.
<P>

32	     The other matter which has to be noted that is there a duty to
compromise small estate claims.  They are frequently the
subject of litigation
that erodes the estate and has unfortunate consequences on the parties. There
is little left.  The costs that
have be met on the plaintiff and the
defendant's side are $17,434.00 dollars and the cash that the plaintiff has and
what is in the
estate certainly will not cover that.  I note that the matter
was presented in an economical way for which I am thankful.  However
apart from
putting that the provision of the will should be upheld there was little put to
the court by way of evidence to justify
the resistance to the claim. This
should have been well known to those advising the second and third defendants
at least by the middle
of 1998.
<P>

33	     Accordingly I order the second and third defendant to pay the
plaintiff's and the defendant's costs on a party and party
basis from 31 July
1998.  To the extent that they may not be so paid, only in the event of their
not being paid, I order that the
first defendant's costs on an indemnity basis
that the plaintiffs costs on a party and party basis may be paid or retained
out of
the estate of the deceased. The exhibits may be returned.
<P>

 
<P>

 ( Mr Gorrick asked for clarification of the costs order)
<P>

 
<P>

MASTER: I have made one order for costs.  And in respect of the second cost
order that order will also apply in respect of costs
prior to 31 July 1998.
<P>

     The first order is that the second and third defendant will pay the
plaintiff's and defendant's costs from 31 July 1988 on
a party and party basis.
And the second is that to the extent they are not paid, the first defendant's
costs on indemnity basis and
the plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis
are to come out of the estate.  And to the extent there are costs prior to 31
July
1998, they are to be paid out of the estate in respect of the first
defendant on an indemnity basis, in the respect of the plaintiff,
on a party
and party basis.
