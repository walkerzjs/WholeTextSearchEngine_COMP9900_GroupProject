<i>Tuesday, 4 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1302/99	GABRIEL STONE HOMES PTY LIMITED   -v-   READY RAIN WATERING SYSTEMS
PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER: </b>By Summons filed on 9 February 1999 the
plaintiff Gabriel Stone Homes Pty Limited claims an order pursuant to section
459G of the<b> </b><i>Corporations Law</i> that the statutory demand dated 18
January 1999 served upon the plaintiff by the defendant Ready Rain Watering
Systems Pty Limited
be set aside.
<P>

2   	By that statutory demand the defendant seeks payment to it
by the plaintiff of the amount of $11,145. That amount is described
in the
schedule to the demand as "unpaid invoices rendered to the company on
19/11/98".
<P>

3   	The claim of the defendant relates to the provision and
supply of certain irrigation works at a site at Homebush Bay in respect
of
which the head contractor was a company Waller Constructions Pty Limited, and
the plaintiff was a subcontractor. The subcontract
which the plaintiff had with
the head contractor included the provision of the irrigation works which
ultimately were provided by
the defendant. There is now no dispute that the
defendant provided that irrigation system at the site. The dispute, however,
relates
to the entity which is liable to pay the defendant for that work.
<P>

4   	The present proceedings are brought pursuant to the
provisions of section 459H of the<b> </b><i>Corporations Law</i>. Subsection
(1) of that section provides for the situation where the Court is satisfied
that there is a genuine dispute between the
company and the respondent about
the existence, or amount, of a debt to which the demand relates.
<P>

5   	In the instant case the plaintiff submits that there is a
genuine dispute that the plaintiff is liable to pay the amount claimed
by the
defendant. The basis of that submission is that the plaintiff is not the entity
which is liable to pay for the installation
of the irrigation system which was
provided by the defendant. The plaintiff submits that there is a genuine
dispute as to whether
it is the plaintiff or Waller Constructions which is
liable to pay for that work.
<P>

6   	The present proceedings are not an appropriate vehicle in
which to decide disputed questions of fact concerning the ultimate
liability
for the payment of the amount claimed by the defendant. All that is necessary
for the plaintiff in the present proceedings
to establish is that there is a
genuine dispute as to whether the plaintiff is liable to pay for that work.  It
is not necessary
for the plaintiff to establish that the Court must be
satisfied that the plaintiff is not liable to pay for the work, or for the
plaintiff to establish that the defendant could not succeed in a claim in a
court of  appropriate jurisdiction for the work performed
by the defendant.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff relies upon a number of evidentiary matters
as supporting the existence of a genuine dispute as to whether it
is the
plaintiff which is the appropriate entity under a legal obligation to pay for
the work which the defendant performed. 
<P>

8   	Firstly, although the defendant submitted to the plaintiff
a document being, a quotation for the supply and installation of
an automatic
irrigation system at the Homebush Bay Sub-station, nevertheless, that document
was never signed, or otherwise adopted
in any formal sense, by the
plaintiff.
<P>

9   	There is evidence given by Mr Fawas Gabriel, the principal
of the plaintiff, concerning various conversations which he asserts
he had with
Miss Vicki Anne Tumminello, the principal of the defendant, concerning the
provision of a booster pump.  Those conversations
are inconsistent with the
conversations of which evidence is given by Miss Tumminello.
<P>

10   	It is not necessary for me in the present proceedings to
resolve those inconsistencies. It is appropriate that I should proceed
upon the
basis that those conversations are inconsistent and to consider whether it can
be argued that the version given by Mr Fawas
Gabriel is a version which could
be accepted at a final hearing in proceedings for recovery of this debt in an
appropriate court.
<P>

11   	Although cross-examined in the course of the present
hearing, Mr Gabriel did not withdraw from the version of the conversations
which he gave.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff also points to the fact that in her evidence
Miss Tumminello described the usual procedure which was adopted
by her company
in entering into a contract with another party for the supply and installation
of an irrigation system. That usual
procedure included the quotation document
being signed by the contracting party; the supply by the defendant of, firstly,
drawings
and, secondly, operating manuals to the contracting party; and the
participation by the contracting party at the final inspection
and
commissioning of the irrigation system.
<P>

13   	In the instant case, the defendant departed from its usual
procedure by not requiring the quotation to be signed by the plaintiff,
by not
supplying to the plaintiff drawings or operating manuals and by not involving
the plaintiff in the final inspection and commissioning
of the irrigation
system.
<P>

14   	An explanation was offered for the non-participation of
the plaintiff in that inspection and commissioning, in that, according
to Miss
Tumminello, she found it difficult to contact Mr Gabriel at the relevant
time.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff also points to the fact, of which evidence
was given by Miss Tumminello, that the commissioning and inspection
were
arranged at the request of Waller Constructions. Further, the plaintiff points
to the fact that the ultimate contact by the
defendant in respect to the
booster pump (being reflected in a document headed "Pressure Inquiry" addressed
to the Water Board) named
as the person to whom inquiries should be directed by
the Water Board not the plaintiff, or anyone concerned with the plaintiff
company,
but one Scott Waller, who I would infer to be a principal of  Waller
Constructions.
<P>

16   	The defendant, however, submits that there is strong
evidence which not merely does not support the existence of a genuine
dispute,
but supports the submission that any alleged dispute as to whether or not the
plaintiff was the appropriate entity liable
to pay for the work performed by
the defendant is not in fact a genuine dispute. In this regard the defendant
relies upon several
letters from Waller Constructions to the plaintiff, being
the two letters of 8 January 1999 and 23 February 1999 (comprising Exhibit
1),
and the letter of 18 January 1999 (Exhibit 2).
<P>

17   	Certainly, the two letters in Exhibit 1 suggest that
Waller Constructions regarded the plaintiff as being responsible for
the
payment for the installation of the irrigation system. In this regard it is not
without significance that Mr Gabriel, although,
in his oral evidence at today's
hearing he disputed the accuracy of those letters, nevertheless, upon receiving
those letters, chose
to ignore them and not to respond in any way by pointing
out either to Waller Constructions or to the defendant that the figures
and
assertions contained therein were incorrect.
<P>

18   	It should be noted, however, that those letters were
written after the dispute had arisen between the plaintiff and the defendant
concerning the defendant's claim against the plaintiff. The work had been
performed by the defendant between 16 and 20 November 1998
and these letters
from Waller Constructions were written in January and February 1999. 
<P>

19   	It is somewhat curious that neither party has seen fit to
place before the Court evidence which would be clearly available
from Waller
Constructions as to whether that company had paid the plaintiff for the work
performed by the defendant. If Waller Constructions
had actually paid the
plaintiff for the installation of the irrigation system, that would be
completely determinative of the present
proceedings. There could be no
possibility of a genuine dispute in those circumstances that the plaintiff was
the entity then liable
to pay the defendant for the work.
<P>

20   	Of course, if Waller Constructions had not paid the
plaintiff for the work, it would still be open for the defendant to assert
that
the plaintiff was the entity which was liable to pay the defendant for this
work. But, although evidence has been placed before
the Court, being an
affidavit sworn 12 March 1999 by Anthony Asnicar, he being the site manager for
Waller Constructions, nevertheless,
neither in that affidavit, nor in the
correspondence from that company is it revealed whether or not Waller
Constructions has actually
paid the plaintiff for the installation of the
irrigation system.
<P>

21   	It was certainly in contemplation that that irrigation
system would be a component of the contract between Waller Constructions
and
the plaintiff. But, as I say, the evidence of Mr Asnicar did not address itself
to what one might have considered to have been
a vital question, an answer to
which would have been determinative of the present proceedings.
<P>

22   	The plaintiff chose not to cross-examine Mr Asnicar.
Accordingly, the Court is left without any direct evidence as to whether
Waller
Constructions has paid the plaintiff for this work. 
<P>

23   	I do not consider that the subsequent conduct of the
defendant, for example, in invoicing Waller Constructions, or, as a component
of that invoicing, in raising a credit in the name of the plaintiff in respect
to this work is in any way determinative of the defendant's
claim against the
plaintiff. It is quite obvious that that conduct, which took place well after
the dispute between the plaintiff
and the defendant became apparent, was part
of a fully understandable and quite legitimate desire by the defendant to be
paid by
somebody for the work which the defendant had performed.
<P>

24   	I have already stated that it is not part of the function
of the Court in the present proceedings to arrive at any concluded
decision as
to whether or not the plaintiff is liable to pay the defendant at the amount
claimed.  All that the Court is required
to do, and beyond which it would be
inappropriate for the Court to proceed, is to decide whether there is a genuine
dispute as to
whether it is the plaintiff which is the entity liable to pay for
the work performed by the defendant. It is apparent that there
is such a
genuine dispute, and, in those circumstances, I must set aside the statutory
demand.
<P>

25   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the statutory demand served by the defendant upon the plaintiff
be set aside.
<P>

2.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff.
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
