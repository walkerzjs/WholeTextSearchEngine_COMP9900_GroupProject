1   	The present application is for orders in terms of a Summons
brought on an ex parte basis by ASIC for which leave has been given
to be filed
in Court to-day. The orders sought are based upon ASIC having issued a notice
under s600(3) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> prohibiting the First Defendant
from "managing" a corporation as that term is defined in s91A of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, for a period not exceeding five years. This can be
done where, as here, the Defendant was a director of more than one liquidated
company which, according to the liquidator's report, paid less than 50 cents in
the dollar to unsecured creditors, within the preceding
seven years. This is so
long as the person concerned was in office at any time during the period of
twelve months ending on the day
the winding-up began. ASIC has satisfied me
that prima facie the requirements of s600 were satisfied including the
procedural ones.
In particular I am satisfied that the notice in writing under
s600(2) was given to the First Defendant who exercised the opportunity
afforded
to him to attempt to show cause why the relevant notice should not be served
upon him. The orders sought are by way of injunctive
restraint under s1324 of
the <i>Corporations Law</i> of an interim nature directed to preventing the
First Defendant from continuing to manage in terms of s91A of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2   	This is in circumstances where on the evidence before me in
the form of an affidavit of Mr Ivory dated 5 July 1999 it is clear
that the
First Defendant is in fact managing the corporations there identified, being
the Second, Third and Fourth Defendants.
<P>

3   	Before me is the report of a delegate of ASIC Mr Reynolds,
dated 16 October 1997 ("INK1") followed by the notice of prohibition
to which I
have earlier made reference ("INK2"). ASIC's submission is that when the Court
is satisfied that the conditions laid down
by s600 have prima facie been
fulfilled for the issuance of what is called a s600 notice prohibiting a person
from managing a corporation,
the Court in giving injunctive relief is not
required to look further at whether there might be grounds for challenging that
notice.
This is more particularly where the grounds for challenge would be not
to this Court ordinarily but under s1317B of the <i>Corporations Law</i> to the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal; see <i>Iliopoulos v ASC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%201512" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLC
1512</a>; <i>Laycock v Forbes</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20150%20ALR%20186" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 150 ALR 186</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=25%20ACSR%20659" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">25 ACSR 659.</a> That may be so
in general terms. But the Court does need to consider, particularly when an
application for enforcement is brought
on an ex parte basis, whether the
considerations which led ASIC to issue the relevant s600 notice appear
congruent with the requirements
of s600 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>. The
source for doing so in the present case is the delegate's report and the
affidavit of Mr Ivory.
<P>

4   	To look further as to the kind of matters that might be
raised before the AAT should not ordinarily be necessary. In the present
case
that conclusion is fortified by the fact that an application to the AAT by the
First Defendant was discontinued on 3 July 1998.
Certainly a necessarily broad
consideration of Mr Reynold's decision as ASIC delegate culminating in paras
5.16 and 5.17 of his report,
reveals there were aspects of Mr Keech's conduct
earlier identified which support the action taken by ASIC in issuing the
notice,
congruently with s600. Thus he refers in para 5.16 and earlier to Mr
Keech causing the transfer of assets from a company in liquidation
to another
company which subsequently went into liquidation. In para 5.17 he refers to a
failure to pay group tax in the case of
Lakeview Kitchen (Sales) Pty Ltd, a
company controlled by Mr Keech, which subsequently went into liquidation. Those
aspects in turn
led to the determination that Mr Keech "demonstrated a serious
lack of commercial morality" in respect to the debt to the Australian
Taxation
Office (5.16.3). He also exhibited conduct, described in 5.17.13, as
demonstrating "Mr Keech's dishonesty toward the company's
preferential
creditor" (5.17.5). It is not of course appropriate for me to express any view
in relation to those findings beyond
noting that they have not been
subsequently challenged and that they support ASIC in now seeking enforcement
of its notice.
<P>

5   	This then provides a background of concern about Mr Keech
simply disregarding the prohibition upon his managing corporations
where the
conditions of s600 have prima facie been fulfilled. Mr Keech did not seek the
leave of the Court to undertake such management,
as required by s600(5); see
most recently <i>Didovich v ASIC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2029%20ACSR%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 29 ACSR 122</a> for how that discretion
is to be exercised by a court. Had he had proper grounds, he could readily have
made application under s600(5)
and chose not to do so. In those circumstances,
the orders sought on an interim basis ought to be made in the public interest.
I
have considered whether they should be suspended in operation for a short
time. But having regard to the matters earlier noted I
consider they should be
made operative forthwith, though with leave to apply on reasonable notice.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

6   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	The First Defendant is, without leave of the Court, prohibited from

indirectly) concerned in managing, the Second, Third and/or Fourth
Defendants.

causing, or allowing, the Second, Third and/or Fourth Defendants

further liabilities, from the date hereof.
<P>

financial institution with which the Second, Third
and/or Fourth Defendants or
any of them conduct an account or accounts, notice of these Orders.
<P>

(5)	Orders (1), (2) and (3) shall not restrain the doing of anything which is
not "management" or "managing" within the meaning

<i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

(6)	That the time for service be abridged to 11 am on 7 July 1999.
<P>

(7)	Leave to apply on reasonable notice.
<P>

(8)	I direct the matter come back before the Corporations Judge at 10 am 12
July 1999.
