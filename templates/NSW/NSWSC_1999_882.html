<b>JUDGMENT</b>-- ex tempore
<P>

<b>30 August 1999</b>
<P>

1   	What follows are my reasons for making the orders by way of
judicial advice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s63</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</i> 1925</a> (NSW).
<P>

2   	Attached to this judgment is a chronology of the relevant
events.  Essentially what has happened is that back in October 1984,
a scheme
of arrangement contemplated that certain monies be paid to the relevant
overseas shareholder beneficiaries of the scheme
and indeed that is what so far
as possible occurred.  However, a number of such beneficiaries have failed to
present their cheques
and some cannot be located.  The amounts individually are
small.  But in overall terms, out of approximately $300,000 realised for
overseas shareholders from sale of their shares, $106,000 only was able to be
distributed of their entitlement for the reasons mentioned,
leaving
approximately $190,000 still in the relevant trust fund held by the two
applicants as trustee.
<P>

3   	The trustees of these funds are accountants who wish to be
indemnified for their costs and are entitled to be.  This is in
circumstances
where the company is now insolvent.  Under the terms of clause 2.7 of the
scheme, the company bears the cost of meeting
the trustee's costs.  The
Applicant's submissions note that there is however no provision under clause
2.7 precluding the trustee's
right of indemnity at general law from the
relevant trust fund.  In all the circumstances, including that the trustees
forego any
profit on their costs, calculated at a 10 per cent margin, and the
long passage of time (nearly 15 years) in which the residue of
the fund has
been left unclaimed, and the fact that about $140,000 will still remain, I am
satisfied that the monies standing in
the relevant account may be applied as to
$48,150.90 to pay all outstanding costs and a further amount be paid for the
costs of the
present application.  
<P>

4   	The detailed submissions are in the file and are initialled
by me for identification and I consider they correctly state the
position to
the extent necessary to underpin the basis of the orders I have made. 
<P>
