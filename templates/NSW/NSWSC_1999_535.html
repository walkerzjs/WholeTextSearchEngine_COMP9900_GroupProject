<b>050268/95  -  CURRABUBULA HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED and PAOLA HOLDINGS PTY LTD  v
STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LIMITED </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In paragraph 1124 of the judgment delivered on
30 March 1999 the Court indicated that the proceedings would be
re-listed for
further submissions in relation to any specific claims which either party
contended had not yet been dealt with, such
as interest, including claims for
interest charges unnecessarily incurred, for submissions in relation to costs
and for the making
of final orders.  Paragraph 1072 had reserved for further
submissions the question of the precise relief to be granted in respect
of the
defamation cause of action in the light of the judgment.
<P>

2   	Both parties have now addressed submissions dealing
with:
<P>

(a)	damages for defamation;
<P>

(b)	quantum of damages;
<P>

(c) 	interest;
<P>

(d)	costs<i>.</i>
<P>

3   	I deal with these matters seriatim.
<P>

<b>DAMAGES FOR DEFAMATION</b>
<P>

4   	In the judgment at paragraph 1065 the confined mode of
pleading the imputations was noted as leading to the holding that Currabubula
was defamed only upon the publishing of the Bank statements in respect of
itself.
<P>

5   	The difficulties posed for the Court in determining what
damages Currabubula alone is entitled to recover in respect of those
Bank
statements published on and after 21 February 1990 and bearing the offensive
"in liq" notations, were referred to in the judgment
at paragraph 1071.
<P>

6   	The fact that no specific evidence had been devoted to
examining what loss flowed from the publishing of the Currabubula statements,
as opposed to the detailed evidence of what followed the publishing of the
earlier Bank statements, was referred to in the judgement
at paragraph 1067.
<P>

7   	The parties have now addressed detailed submissions on the
matters reserved for further submission in the judgment at paragraph
1072.
<P>

8   	Currabubula submits that the Court should consider the
context of the publications as part of a continuum.  The submission
is that
prior to the specific publication relating to Currabubula, it cannot be said
that all the damage had already been done and
that in consequence, the sending
of the statements to Currabubula had no independent effect.  Currabubula
submits that to so argue
is to incorrectly suggest that the total damage to
Currabubula was done upon the sending of the first Bank statement containing
the
notation to another member of the Group.  Such an approach is said to fly
in the face of what Currabubula contends was "the Court's
determination...that
the matter cannot be viewed in isolation".  [Submissions 14 April 1999
paragraph 19]
<P>

9   	Currabubula then submits as follows:-
<P>

<i>"(1)	 The proper analysis is that each offending publication to the Group
companies reflected upon Currabubula as suggested at paragraph
1065 of the
judgment and affected Currabubula's reputation and goodwill.  The effect upon
Currabubula would depend it is submitted,
upon the company to which the
notation relates.  It is submitted that at the relevant time there were only
two companies in the Group
which had any real reputation and income earning
ability, namely NRS and Currabubula.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	 The effect of the defamatory statement to Currabubula was that, to the
greater community, the Bank had withdrawn support for
the entire Group
including Currabubula Holdings (judgment paragraph 806) and that it was no
longer viable.</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	 The defamation took out of the hands of Currabubula the effective
control of its affairs (judgment paragraph 1015).  Any remnants
of
Currabubula's ability to argue that it was separate and distinct from the
problems of the Group because of its previous reputation
as a solid land
holding company, was effectively destroyed by the publication of the defamatory
statement.</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	 This led as a matter of fact as found by the Court to an inability of
Currabubula and the Group to regain the good offices of
suppliers and creditors
and took out of the hands of the Group and Currabubula, the ability to deal in
any manner with creditors
whose confidence was required to be regained.
[Judgment paragraph 809].</i>
<P>

<i>(5)	 There is evidence referred to in the judgment of an inability to
refinance from April 1990 and evidence of Mr Paola's attempts
to
refinance.</i>
<P>

<i>(6)	 The Court was at pains to make it clear that the controlling mind of
Currabubula and in fact the Group was Tony Paola.  A considerable
part of the
summary of the facts at the beginning of the judgment was dedicated to
recounting the Bank's view of what kind of entrepreneur
Tony Paola was and the
credit rating assigned to the Group during their relationship.</i>
<P>

<i>(7)	 The Court has accepted that the fortunes of the Group enterprises were
linked to Tony Paola's ability and business acumen to
sell assets to repay debt
when necessary.</i>
<P>

<i>(8)	 The effect of the defamation was to take control of the assets of the
Group out of its hands and to take away also Tony Paola's
ability to use and
leverage the company's assets to invest or raise further finance".  [Paragraph
952].  To use the Court's phrase,
after the imputation was made, the company
could not through its director and controller &#180;put the genie back in the
bottle'
(paragraph 809).</i>
<P>

<i>(9)	 The publication of the documents affected the staff's own standing and
reputation in the community (paragraph 813).</i>
<P>

<i>(10) The matter was not minor, insignificant or minimal (paragraph
820).</i>
<P>

<i>(11) It was accepted by the Court that the support of its bankers to a going
concern may as a general matter be regarded as one of
the first matters of
interest to those dealing with such a concern (paragraph 820).</i>
<P>

<i>(12) The Court held that as a matter of contract, the value of NRS was
diminished by the Bank's breach which gave rights to Currabubula
to sue for
that breach.</i>
<P>

<i>(13) The Court held that the Bank always accepted that its exposure to the
Group was more than adequately protected by the security
cover given by
Currabubula through its land holding.  It was also accepted that the Group was
prepared to sell assets when required
to meet commitments.</i>
<P>

<i>(14) As at April 1990, the Group owed $8,500,000 all of which was secured by
Currabubula's land holding.</i>
<P>

<i>(15) It is submitted that in light of the above, the harm to Currabubula's
reputation translated to an effective liquidation of Currabubula's
assets to
satisfy the debts of the Group and to take away any business credibility held
by Currabubula to re-finance the debt.  It
lost all ability to be pro-active
(paragraph 809).</i>
<P>

<i>(16) The purpose of an award of damages to Currabubula arising from the
defamation is to compensate it for the effects of the defamatory
statements.
Whilst Currabubula cannot of course, recover damages for injured feelings see

<P>

<i>(17) A corporation can recover damages for injury to its business reputation
without proof of any specific loss of business; South

in that case:-</i>
<P>

<i>Statements may be made with regard to their mode of carrying on business,
such   as lead people of ordinary sense to the  opinion
that they conduct their
business badly and inefficiently.  If so, the law will be the same in their
case as in that of an individual,
and the statement will be libellous.  Then,
if the case be one of libel - whether on a person, firm or a company - the law
is that
damages are at large.  It is not necessary to prove any particular
damage;  the jury may give such damages as they think fit, having
regard to the
conduct of the parties respectively, and all the circumstances of the case".
(See also Lewis, at 262, Barnes at 473-474,
478-479 and 485</i>
<P>

<i>(18) Further in such cases damage arising from the publication is presumed

<P>

<i>(19) In the present case, for the reasons found by the Court and referred to
above, the defamation was a serious one that affected
the fortunes of the
entire Group and those of Currabubula.  The starting point is to compare the
fortunes of Currabubula before and
after the defamation took place.</i>
<P>

<i>(20) it is submitted that the loss to Currabubula's reputation can be
measured in one fo the following ways:</i>
<P>

<i>(I)	The loss of the chance to obtain a loan.  It should be inferred that
Currabubula could have re-financed had it reputation not
been harmed - namely
its loss is the inability to have access to a facility of $8,500,000 as at
February 1990.</i>
<P>

<i>(II)	The value of the land holdings actually sold by Currabubula which it
would otherwise not have to have sold to repay the debt
- namely the sale
proceeds of Gabo ($3,500,000), Durhambone West ($1,304,000) and the
re-financing to the Commonwealth Bank in June
1992 ($1,200,000) which totals
$6,004,000.</i>
<P>

<i>(III)	As for (II) above with the addition of 	the value of Durhambone East
($4,300,000) - which totals $10,304,000.</i>
<P>

<i>(IV)	The reduction in Currabubula's net asset position from 30 June 1989 to
30 June 1992 by which time the relationship between the
Bank and Currabubula
came to an end - the evidence (vol 7 of PX1) shows the net asset position of
Currabubula at 30 June 1989 was
$19,629,643, at 30 June 1990 $18,648,786, at 30
June 1991 $9,800,828 and at 30 June 1992 $9,072,972.  The plaintiff submits
that
Currabubula's reputation as a corporation is equal to at least its net
asset position from time to time as that figure measures the
entity's total
value excluding debts and other obligations.  The combined effect of these
amounts is to reflect a reduction in the
company's net asset position of
$10,556,716.</i>
<P>

<i>(V)	As an alternative to (IV) above, it is submitted that the reduction in
Currabubula's reputation (the reduction in the net asset
position) was caused
as a result of the statement being made about Currabubula and about individual
companies in the Group which
reflected badly upon Currabubula.  In this case,
it is submitted the Court can apportion the reduction in the value of
Currabubula's
reputation between the effect of the publication directly to
Currabubula and the effect as a result of the reflection from other
companies
in the Group.  The plaintiff submits that as at February 1990, the only
companies of the Group with any real commercial
presence were Currabubula as
the land holder and Currabubula as the pastoral land holding company.
Accordingly any apportionment
should be for a maximum of 50 per cent
(50%).</i>
<P>

<i>(VI)	The value of an opportunity lost.  The only real opportunity lost was
the purchase of shares in Ubix.  In the absence of a cogent
reason from the
defendant why such a thing would not have occurred but for a lack of funds,
then the Court is entitled to and should
consider the likelihood of such an
investment being made and the likelihood of a damage claim being mounted.  The
plaintiff submits
such an opportunity was real and in fact lost.  The
defendants have assessed the value of the investment at NZ$14,640,800 at the
relevant time".</i>
<P>

<i>(21) The loss suffered by Currabubula to its reputation by reason of the
defamation is directly linked to the reduction of its asset
holdings.  It is
wrong and too simplistic to say that the sale by Currabubula of its assets to
reduce debt was simply the replacing
of an asset with a lower liability.  This
ignores the reputation of Currabubula which had been found and acknowledged by
the bank
as being a rural land holding which had "blossomed" (judgment
paragraph 107), generated after tax net profit of $2,100,000 (judgment
paragraph 175) and provided 2.79 times security cover to its loans (paragraph
174).  It was the vehicle underpinning the Group and
was the vehicle to realise
the entrepreneurial plans to leverage from and expand its assets and fortunes
from the strategic holding
and disposal of its assets".</i>
<P>

10   	Currabubula also addressed the following submissions in
support of its suggested reputation up until February 1990:-
<P>

<i>"(a)	As at August 1987 it was recorded by the Bank  that the attraction of
Mr and Mrs Paola to their rural operations had seen their
rural holdings
"blossom" into a livestock and pastoral operation  under the name of
`Currabubula Station' with a combined area of
27,000 hectares (paragraph
107).</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	 The bank was not concerned with its exposure  position because of the
extent of its security (paragraph 146).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	 By February  1989 the bank enjoyed a security cover of 2.79 times the
debt upon a valuation of $16,341,253 (paragraph 174).</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	 The net profit of Currabubula after tax for the year ended 30 June 1988
was $2,100,000 (paragraph 175).</i>
<P>

<i>(e)  The bank expressed comfort in its security (paragraph 182).</i>
<P>

<i>(f)  It was being proposed in about June 1989 that from this base, the
operations would be floated (paragraph 207).</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	 By October 1989 the Group had three areas of income, namely, the fax
business, the rural operations of NRS and the pastoral operations
conducted on
Currabubula's property.</i>
<P>

<i>(h)  The objective as at January 1990 was to reduce total bank debt to
$5,000,000 (paragraph 382).</i>
<P>

<i>(i)  The Group's revenue base at January 1990 was substantially reliant on
the properties (paragraph 383) which were all owned by
Currabubula.  The
plaintiff submits it can be inferred that Currabubula on its own from its own
properties could support a loan up
to about $5,000.000."</i>
<P>

11   	Currabubula submits that the significance of the Court's
findings is to place the defamatory statements as held to have been
published
into an overall timeline.  It is submitted in this regard that at the time the
statements were made the facts were:-
<P>

<i>"(a)	The current accounts had been `frozen'.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	News was getting about that the Group and/or Mr Paola were "going
bust".</i>
<P>

<i>(c)  Nothing was specifically said at the time   about Currabubula.  That
is, though Currabubula  was affected by the overall conduct
of the Bank  and
the overall perception of the Group as described at judgment paragraph 806, no
specific  statement had been said
of it.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)  Bank statements had been sent in relation to  other companies in the
Group with the defamatory notation.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)  Currabubula still owned all its property and this fact would have been
known in the community.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)  Cheques drawn by Currabubula and the Group companies had been
dishonoured.</i>
<P>

12   	Hence, Currabubula submits that the sending of the Bank
statements to Currabubula itself with the defamatory notation was
at the time a
continuation of the Bank's earlier conduct in the circumstances.
<P>

13   	The Bank takes issue with any suggestion that Currabubula
is entitled to obtain damages in respect of defamation of the "Group"
and/or of
companies in the Group otherwise than itself.  The submission is that
"Currabubula is only entitled to obtain damages in
respect of the damage it
suffered".  [Bank submissions 23 April 1999 paragraph 1]
<P>

14   	The Bank then submits:-
<P>

<i>1.	That Currabubula cannot recover damages for  injured feelings but only
for injury to its business or trading reputation and its
goodwill.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	That at the time of the publications, Currabubula carried on no
business.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	That as Currabubula was not trading, its business or trading reputation
or goodwill could not be adversely affected.</i>
<P>

15   	The Bank further submits that there is no evidence of
Currabubula having suffered any "special damage" as a result of the
defamation
- that is, that there is no evidence of any identifiable financial loss
suffered by Currabubula.
<P>

16   	The Bank further submits as follows:-
<P>

<i>"1.	(a)	In paragraph 23 of its Submissions Currabubula refers to the finding
that the Bank's actions prevented the "Group" from being
able to "regain the
good offices...of . . . suppliers of creditors..." (paragraph 809 of the
Judgment).  (It must be noted however
that the Judgment recognises that part of
the cause of this difficulty were the dishonoured cheques and the `freezing
letter' - it
was not, by any means, caused solely by the defamation and
certainly not by the alleged defamations of Currabubula constituted by
the bank
statements of 21, 23, 28 February and 7, 14, 21, 28 March, these being well
after the critical days of 15 and 16 February
and the start of the extensive
and justified dishonour of cheques by the bank).</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Mrs Hamblin's evidence was to the effect that that:-</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	The suppliers/creditors who made contact with her did so because they
had received dishonoured cheques, they did not say anything
about bank
statements.  [T298.40-50]</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	They were making inquiries concerning NRS.  [T289.10 and
296-298]</i>
<P>

<i>(iii) A neighbour said to her that Mr Paola 	had "gone bust".
[T292.10]</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Mr Paola's evidence was also of discussions concerning NRS [Para 61 to
74 statement of 16 October 1996 and T50.55 - 60.39]</i>
<P>

<i>There was no evidence that any person, other than possibly the employees of
NRS, had formed an adverse opinion as to Currabubula's
credit because of the
defamation.  There was no evidence at all of publication of the Currabubula
bank statements or their contents
to anyone outside the Group.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	There was no evidence of:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	There being any "suppliers" to Currabubula;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	There being any difficulties with suppliers or creditors of
Currabubula</i>
<P>

<i>and, having regard to the fact that Currabubula did not trade, it ought be
inferred that its only creditors were secured creditors
- such as the Bank and
other creditors whose dealings with Currabubula would be unaffected by the
defamation - for example the Local
Council which might be owed Council
rates.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	There is no evidence which would justify an award of more than nominal
damages for the defamation.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	There is certainly no evidence whatsoever to support the Plaintiff's
contention in paragraph 34 of the Submissions that the defamation
caused an
"effective liquidation" of Currabubula".</i>
<P>

<i>"2.	The activity and conversations regarding the Group's solvency occurred
on 16 February 1990 (paragraph 492 to 514 of the Judgment).
 Mr Paola spoke to
creditors "within days of 16 February" (paragraph 512).  The first of the
Currabubula "in liq" statements was
not sent until 21 February and so was not
the cause of the "damage" described by Mr Paola in his evidence.  For the
reasons set out
in the preceding paragraph, the statements, the first of which
was not sent until a week after the first cheques were dishonoured,
were not
the cause of the "damage" described by Mrs Hamblin either".</i>
<P>

<i>"3.	Dealing specifically with assessment of damages referred to in paragraph
39 of the Plaintiff's Submissions:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	There is no evidence that Currabubula ever sought another loan, let
alone that it refused another loan.  There is no evidence
upon which a
conclusion could be reached that the loss of reputation caused by the
defamation prevented it from being able to refinance.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii) and (iii)	There is no causal connection between the defamation and the
sale of the properties or the amounts received on the
sale:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)  Currabubula had decided to sell Durhambone months before the defamatory
material was published (paragraph 947 judgment).</i>
<P>

<i>(b)  Attempts to sell had taken place before the defamatory material was
published (judgment paragraph 947).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The reduction in value of the properties was caused by factors such as
market uncertainty, rather than any loss of reputation
of Currabubula (judgment
paragraph 947).</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Durhambone West and Gabo were sold on 16 June 1994 and 30 August 1991
respectively long after the publication of the defamatory
material, and at a
time when its "effect" would have been spent.</i>
<P>

<i>(iv) and (v)	There is no causal connection between the defamation and the
reduction in Currabubula's net asset position.  The reduction
in net asset
position occurred as a result of factors such as the drought, reduction in
grain prices and wool prices, reduction in
land values, guarantee obligations
in relation to ABE Fax et cetera.  [PX 824]</i>
<P>

<i>It must not be forgotten that the accounts prepared by Currabubula are not,
in any event reliable - its auditor qualified the accounts
because significant
debts or contingent debts were excluded.  [PX 824]</i>
<P>

<i>(vi)  There is no causal connection between the loss of the opportunity to
purchase Ubix's shares and the defamation.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	Until the last day of Submissions, the only case the Bank had to meet was
an allegation that the defamation was contained in one
bank statement of 14
February.  On the last day of the Submissions, Currabubula was given leave to
withdraw that allegation and to
tender bank statements that were issued to
Currabubula on 21, 23, 28 February and 7, 14, 21 and 28 March 1990 which
contained the
reference to &#180;in liq'.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	The first `in liq' statement sent to Currabubula was sent a number of
days after the first `in liq' statements were issued.  Schedule
2 to the
Further Amended Summons identifies an `in liq' statement having been sent to
Pyojit Pty Limited on 13 February 1990 and
three `in liq' statements having
been sent to NRS on 16 February.  There was no complaint by Mr Paola or anybody
in relation to these
earlier statements notwithstanding that, if complaint had
been made, the sending of the `in liq' statements to Currabubula would
have
been averted.</i>
<P>

<i>6.	Furthermore, it appears that the Bank was sending `in liq' statements to
Currabubula over a period of six weeks.  There was no
complaint during this
period by Mr Paola or anybody to the Bank concerning the Currabubula
statements, or indeed in relation to any
of the bank statements noting `in
liq', and any damage which Currabubula sustained could have been significantly
reduced if Currabubula
had notified the Bank of the difficulties that the `in
liq' notation was causing soon after the first or second of the bank statements
were received.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	The fact that no-one from the Paola Group took the trouble to ask for the
form of statements to be changed is strong evidence that
the sending of further
statements with the `in liq' reference on them was regarded as of no
significance, even if the initial one
sent to NRS had been.'</i>
<P>

17   	Currabubula in reply, submits as follows:-
<P>

<i>`1.	The Defendant seeks to categorise the Plaintiff's submissions as
claiming compensation for defamation of the Corporate Group of
which
Currabubula was a member.  That is not, however, correct.  What is sought are
damages for defamation of Currabubula, albeit
in the context where Currabubula
was part of a trading group and had commercial interests of its own which were
affected by the defamation.</i>
<P>

<i>2.  The Court recognised (paragraph 1068) that this matter cannot be looked
at in isolation.  There is a finding in any event that
Currabubula itself
suffered loss (paragraph 1070).</i>
<P>

<i>3.  It is incorrect to say that Currabubula carried on no business. . . .  A
more realistic characterisation is that Currabubula conducted
the farming
businesses which took place on its property.  Whilst there was some evidence of
an intention to conduct such operations
through ABE Holdings Pty Limited
(judgment paragraph 329, 330), there is no suggestion that the operations were
conducted pursuant
to any binding agreement which prevented Currabubula from
having the benefit of their operations or such operations being, in substance,
those of Currabubula.</i>
<P>

<i>4.  It was simply a convenient way of organising the Group's business to
have such operations conducted through ABE Holdings, to the
extent that they
were at all.</i>
<P>

<i>5.  The Bank submits that Currabubula did not trade and thus its business or
trading reputation or goodwill could [sic]be affected.
 This is quite an
unrealistic view of Currabubula's role in the Group.  Similarly the submissions
made in paragraph 4 of the Bank's
submissions depend upon Currabubula not being
a trading entity, and thus not having any suppliers or creditors with whom it
could
have any difficulties.  That submission also attempts to ignore the fact
that news of the problems of the Group, which included Currabubula
spread
quickly throughout the community.</i>
<P>

<i>6.  The difficulties in identifying with precision what financial loss was
caused by the defamation should not prevent the Court from
awarding more than
nominal damages.</i>
<P>

<i>7.  The submission in . . . the Bank's submissions attempts to remove the
publication of the Currabubula `in liq' statement from the
causal arena.  This
should not be permitted.  The delivery of the statements to companies in the
Group, and to Currabubula, were
a cause of the subsequent problems of the
Group, including those of Currabubula.</i>
<P>

<i>8.  It is not the point that there may have been no complaint by Mr Paola
about the sending of the statements.  Quite clearly, on
the totality of the
evidence, the delivery of the statement was a very serious blow to Mr Paola and
his Group and could not be described
as being trivial in content or effect.
There is no evidence to suggest that the Bank, if asked, would have stopped
sending out the
`in liq' statement.  In any event if that is relevant since
there was no duty to ask the Bank, and it is not a defence to the Bank's
conduct to assert, as a hypothesis, that it would have so acted.</i>
<P>

18   	The plaintiff's further submissions in reply, dated 2 May
1999, included the following:
<P>

<i>`1.	In response to paragraph 2 of the defendant's submissions, the nature of
Currabubula's business is summarised at par 207 and 208
of the judgment by the
Bank's officer Mr Booth agreeing that Mr Paola, the plaintiff's principal "was
constantly doing what he could
to take advantage of business opportunities ...
and that involved ... for one thing the buying and selling of assets".</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Currabubula's role in the group was on any view, to hold the group's real
property and where and when necessary to buy and sell
such assets.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	The evidence is that it was a common practice of Currabubula to use
vendor finance funding to purchase and trade such assets (pars
591 and
207).</i>
<P>

<i>4.	The defamatory statement did harm Currabubula's ability to utilise this
form of funding as evidenced by the attempts to finance
the purchase of the
Ubix shares and the fact that suppliers put the group on cash only
terms.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	It is common ground that the value of the Group and its constituent
companies constituted, as a whole, a substantial enterprise.
 Of that group the
primary company which held the primary securities was Currabubula which held
net assets at 30 June 1989 of $19,629,643.00.
 It is unrealistic in all the
circumstances to say that once it has been found a defamatory statement has
been made and to find that
the net assets of that company had fallen in June
1992 to $9,072,972.00 to not conclude that some part of that reduction was not
attributable to the defamatory statement.'</i>
<P>

<b>DEALING WITH THE DEFAMATION ISSUE</b>
<P>

THE `NON-TRADING' ISSUE
<P>

19   	Currabubula was at all material times the owner of very
substantial rural properties.  The banking summary set out at judgment
paragraph 108 referred to the Paola's interest in farming properties as `having
blossomed into livestock and pastoral production
under the name "Currabubula
Station",' to the properties as situated at Collarenebri, Tamworth and Narrabri
and to the properties
as having a combined area of over 27,000 hectares.
<P>

20   	At judgment paragraph 178, reference was made to Mr
Booth's acceptance under cross-examination that to his perception, the
importance of Currabubula Holdings was that it owned the rural properties in
the Group and to the significance of these in terms
of the Bank's
securities.
<P>

21   	Currabubula was at all material times clearly an integral
part of the Paola Group and generally known to be such.  It held
one third of
the issued shares in Paola Holdings which together with ABE Holdings (following
a Group restructure) controlled the
operating entities in the Group.  The
restructure (referred to in judgment at paragraphs 93, 242, 325 and 326)
involved ABE Holdings
taking over the pastoral operations from Currabubula
Holdings from 1 July 1989.
<P>

22   	I accept as correct Currabubula's submissions that the
decision to permit ABE Holdings to take over the management of the
properties
in question involved no more than a convenient mode, capable of being later
reversed, of reorganising a section of the
Group's business interests.
<P>

23   	I reject the Bank's submission that as at the date of the
publishing of the Currabubula Bank statements bearing the `in liq'
notation,
the restructuring to which I have referred, meant that the goodwill of
Currabubula could not be adversely affected.
<P>

24   	The fact is that Currabubula was, at the time the Bank
statements were published, a company which had for some years owned
and managed
very extensive rural holdings as part of a closely held group of companies with
diverse interests.  The name `Currabubula
Station' would have been widely
known.  Currabubula had a reputation as a solid land holding company.  By
January 1990 the Group's
revenue base was substantially reliant on the
properties (judgement paragraph 383).  The fact that Currabubula's operations
were,
at the time when the Bank statements were published, by inter-group
arrangement being conducted through an associated group company
in which
Currabubula was an indirect intermediate owner by its joint shareholding in
Paola Holdings, does not mean that Currabubula
was an empty non-trading shell.
To the contrary, Currabubula remained the pivotal land holding company in the
Group, able at a moment's
notice, by further Group reorganisation, to
recommence its previous control and management of the rural operations being
conducted
upon its property.  And even outside such Group reorganisation, it
would qua its legal interest in its properties, have had relevant
dealings with
numerous third parties, including creditors such as the Bank.  It was far
removed from the example posited by Pincus
J in <i>ABC v Comalco</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2012%20FCR%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 12
FCR 510</a> at 602 of an incorporated charity not engaged in any commercial venture
and which receives no income by way of contributions (being
permanently endowed
at the outset), which is defamed.  Pincus J considered that such an artificial
entity was incapable of suffering
loss for which it could recover damages.
<P>

25   	In any event, the Bank's submissions overlook the fact
that a corporation may recover in respect of injury to its reputation
<u>as
such</u>, in contra-distinction to injury to its trade reputation and goodwill.
In <i>Andrews v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 225</a> Mahoney
JA, as his Honour then was, said at 254 to 256:-
<P>

<i>`INJURY TO THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION AS SUCH</i>
<P>

<i>There are two points which are relevant in this regard:  first, that damages
may be awarded to a trading corporation for injury to
its reputation
</i><cite>as such; </cite><i> and, second, that the basis upon which such
damages are calculated differs from that on which damages are calculated for
injuries
of the other kinds to which I have referred.  It is, of course, clear
that damages may be awarded to an individual for injury to
his reputation.  But
it is necessary to have in mind that reputation as used in the law of
defamation, may refer to more than one
thing;  and in my opinion the basis for
the calculation of damages in respect of injury to each of these things may be
different.</i>
<P>

<i>"Reputation" may, in relation to an individual, refer to what may more
accurately be described as his trade reputation, his goodwill
or the like.
This reputation as applied to an architect may refer inter alia to that about
him which will be relevant in relation
to the income derived by him in so far
as it will be apt to induce clients to resort to him.  But in relation to an
individual the
term may refer to his standing, to the regard paid to him in the
community.  I do not mean that this is irrelevant to his income
earning
capacity.  But reputation in this sense, to which I shall refer as
</i><cite>"reputation as such</cite><i>" may exist, and damages may be awarded
for injury done to it even if the individual in question is not involved in any
income earning
activity.</i>
<P>

<i>Damages for injury to reputation as such are in my opinion different in
nature from, and are calculated upon a different basis (and
require different
evidence) from damages for the other kinds of injuries caused by defamatory
material.  Damages for injury to reputation
as such are in the nature of a
solatium;  they are not in the ordinary sense, restitution.  I would with
respect adopt as correct
the statement of law made in this regard by Windeyer J
in Uren v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [(1965)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=66%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">66 SR (NSW) 223</a> at 150].  His
Honour said:</i>
<P>

<i>"When it is said that in an action for defamation damages are given for an
injury to the plaintiff's reputation what is meant?  A
man's reputation, his
good name, the estimation in which he is held in the opinion of others, is not
a possession of his as a chattel
is.  Damage to it cannot be measured as harm
to a tangible thing is measured.  Apart from special damages strictly so-called
and
damages for a loss of clients or customers, money and reputation are not
commensurables.  It seems to me that properly speaking,
a man defamed does not
get compensation for his damaged reputation.  He gets damages because he was
injured in his reputation, that
is simply because he was publicly defamed.  For
this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of
the
plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done.
Compensation is here a solatium rather than a monetary recompense
for harm
measurable in money."</i>
<P>

<i>In Cassell &amp; Co Ltd v Broome <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 1027</a> at 1071, the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, adopted a similar principle and
cited with approval portion of the
passage to which I have referred.  The
passage has been accepted as stating the law by the full court of the Supreme
Court of Victoria,
David Syme and Co Ltd v Mather <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1977/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] VicRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20VR%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] VR 516</a> at 524.</i>
<P>

<i>It is, in my opinion, in this sense that damages [in] defamation are said to
be "at large".  The tribunal is allowed to award what,
on proper community
standards, is the proper solatium to a man whose reputation as such has been
injured.  In the assessment of that
solatium evidence of actual monetary loss
is not essential and, in the strict sense, it may perhaps not be relevant.  In
so far as
actual monetary loss is to be taken into account, that for which the
damages are awarded may, I think, best be seen as something
other than damage
to reputation as such.  These distinctions are fine, but they are in my
opinion, significant in considering what
evidence is necessary to establish
damage and what damage may be inferred and compensated for upon the basis of
particular evidence.</i>
<P>

<i>It is, in my opinion, in accordance with principle to accept that a trading
corporation may have such a reputation and may be awarded
damages for injury to
it.  It appears well accepted that damages may be awarded to a non-trading
corporation for injury to reputation
as such, see Bognor Regis Urban District
Council v Campion  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20QB%20169" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 QB 169</a>; and the cases there referred to, see also
Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th edition vol 28, p 14 paragraph 25.  In such
cases, the
damages were not awarded for injury to assets or loss of income,
that was not the basis on which the claim for damages was made.</i>
<P>

<i>Thus, in National Union of General and Municipal Workers v Gillian [1946] 1
KB 81 damages were awarded to a trade union.  Both Scott
LJ [at 87] and Uthwatt
J [at 88] appeared to recognize that a trading corporation could have a
reputation of the kind for which,
in the case of the union, damages might be
awarded.  Uthwatt J said:  "The social duty so to conduct the affairs of the
union as
not to invite well-founded criticism is hardly forwarded by the denial
of the right to seek redress for an unjustified disparagement
of its
activities."  The union was not injured in its assets or income and, perhaps,
the more recent expressions such as "corporate
image" may be seen as indicating
the nature of that for which the damages were there given.</i>
<P>

<i>There is, in my opinion, nothing in the law which is inconsistent with the
recognition that a company may have such a reputation,
that it may be injured,
and that damages may be awarded for that injury.  I do not think that general
statements as to the position
of a corporation, and what may be recovered by
it:  see, eg, Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 234</a> at 262, should be seen
as indicating a contrary view.  Such injury falls within "harm suffered by" a
plaintiff, within s 46 of the
Defamation Act.</i>
<P>

<i>I think it is to be taken that the jury included, in the awards made by
them, damages for injury to the company's reputation </i><cite>as
such</cite><i> and, therefore, in considering the quantum of the awards, it is
necessary to consider how such damages could have increased such
award as it
would otherwise have been proper to make.</i>
<P>

<i>The company claimed for injury to its "reputation".  There was no
substantial evidence directed specifically to showing the nature
or extent of
the company's reputation;  but it may be inferred from what was said about Mr
Andrews and his reputation, and about
the relationship he had to the company.
What was apt to be the effect of the publications upon the company's reputation
was left
to inference.  The jury was invited to infer that the company had
shown a lack of care and/or competence in the design and the supervision
of the
construction of the building.  It was required to assess the injury done by the
publication made by each newspaper to that
reputation and, in this regard, to
award a solatium accordingly.  Having regard to the nature of what was said,
and the evidence
of the various witnesses, I doubt that the award under this
head alone could have gone a great distance towards justifying the total
amount
awarded.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)  Injury to the company's trade reputation and goodwill:</i>
<P>

<i>The trade reputation, goodwill, and the like ("goodwill") of a company is an
asset, and injury to it may be compensated by damages:
 Lewis v Daily Telegraph
Ltd [1964] AC 254 at 262.  Such injury may consist in depreciation in the value
of the goodwill as an asset,
in the reduction of the income which otherwise
would have been derived from the use of it, or in a combination of both.  No
doubt,
in the ordinary case, the depreciation in the value of the goodwill will
be measured by the fall in the company's relevant profits
or super-profits;
and care will, in assessing damages, need to be taken to avoid overlapping.
Damages for injury to goodwill are,
in my opinion, not "at large" in the sense
in which damages for reputation as such are.  If damages are to be awarded for
such injury,
the amount of injury must be appropriately established, and the
tribunal must be appropriately satisfied of the extent of it.  I
shall return
to this matter in dealing with the award of the damages for direct financial
loss.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

26   	In the same passage his Honour continues to deal with
injury to the second head, namely injury to the company's trade reputation
and
goodwill.
<P>

27   	The underlying difficulty is to deal with a somewhat
artificial position in this case.  The Paola Group as a whole suffered
damage
by reason of the publishing over a period of weeks of the Bank statements
bearing the offensive notations.  The Group as a
whole has not sought to sue in
defamation.  Only in respect of NRS and Pyojit were Bank statements bearing the
notations published
on 15 February 1990 Pyojit and on 16 February 1990
(NRS).
<P>

28   	Neither NRS nor Pyojit have sued in defamation in relation
to these Bank statements.  Neither Currabubula, nor any other Group
member, nor
the Group as a whole, has sued in defamation seeking to plead imputations to
the effect that upon the publication of
<u>any</u> Bank statements to
<u>any</u> Group member, the notations conveyed:
<P>

<i>-  that the whole Group was insolvent or </i>
<P>

<i>-  that specified Group members were insolvent or</i>
<P>

<i>-  that a liquidator had been appointed to the Group or</i>
<P>

<i>-  that a liquidator had been appointed to specified Group companies
or</i>
<P>

<i>-  that the Group businesses were conducted badly or inefficiently or</i>
<P>

<i>-  that all or specified Group companies conducted their businesses badly or
inefficiently.</i>
<P>

29   	How then does the Court deal with the one Group member's
defamation claim grounded upon the publishing only of the later Bank
statements
addressed to it, when it seems clear that, as part of the Group, it first
suffered damage in respect of which it does
not sue, on 15 and 16 February
1990.
<P>

30   	As stated in judgment paragraph 1070, Currabubula suffered
loss because the defamatory utterances in respect to it occurred
at a time when
news of the Group and/or Mr Paola `going bust', was rapidly circulating and
came to embrace Currabubula proper.
<P>

31   	I reject the Bank's submission that the damages awarded to
Currabubula qua its contract claim mean, in substance, that no
loss can be
recovered on the defamation claim.  The latter cause of action is clearly
distinct and Currabubula is entitled to recover
in respect of damages for
injury to its reputation as such.
<P>

32   	I accept as correct, Currabubula's description of its
claim as "damages for defamation of Currabubula, albeit in a context
where
Currabubula was part of a trading group and had commercial interests of its own
which were affected by the defamation".  [Submissions
in reply paragraph 1]
<P>

33   	At the same time, the following passage found at paragraph
1071 of the judgment must be taken into account: "Had the Bank
statements
relating to Currabubula been published on 15/16 February 1990 and had all Group
companies in respect of whom similar Bank
statements had been received on 15/16
February sued in defamation, the defamation case would have been a very
different one".
<P>

34   	As pointed out by Lord Esher MR in <i>South Hetton Coal Co
Ltd v North-Eastern News Association Ltd</i> [1844] 1 QB 133, a corporation can
recover damages for injury to its business reputation without proof of any
specific loss of business.
 [See excerpt recited in Currabubula's written
submissions set out above].
<P>

35   	In Australian Defamation Law and Practice, Butterworths,
1990, by Tobin and Sexton, the following passage appears:-
<P>

<i>`Once the publication of defamatory matter is proved the law presumes damage
except in cases of slander not actionable per se.  A
plaintiff is not required
to prove that his reputation had in fact been damaged.  He is entitled to rely
on the presumption that
some damage will inevitably be caused to his reputation
by the publication of defamatory matter.  Once a tribunal of fact finds for
the
plaintiff on liability, it must award damages even if only nominal damages.
The infringement of the plaintiff's rights itself
entitles him to
damages.</i>
<P>

<i>"In all such cases the law presumes that some damage will flow in the
ordinary course of things from the mere invasion of the plaintiff's
rights and
calls it general damage".'  (Ratcliffe v Evans<b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%202%20QB%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892] 2 QB 524</a> at

36   	In <i>Cassell &amp; Co Ltd</i> <i>v Broome </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1972/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC
1027</a> at 1072, Lord Hailsham referred to the term "damages are at large" as
meaning only that "the whole process of assessing damages...is
essentially a
matter of impression and not addition".
<P>

37   	The defamation was a serious one and occurred in the
Bank's dealings with its customer.  However, the fact that the statements
in
respect of which Currabubula sues, were only published during the middle of the
week following February 15/16 (Thursday/Friday)
is to my mind an extremely
material fact.   In my view Currabubula, in the absence of having proved that
it suffered any special
damage as a result of the defamation in respect of
which it sues, and in the very unusual circumstances above referred to, is
entitled
to a damages award of $15,000.
<P>

<b>CALCULATION OF QUANTUM OF DAMAGES</b>
<P>

38   	The Bank has sought to address submissions going to the
calculation of the quantum of damages dealt with in the judgment.
 Although the
plaintiff submitted that the Court was <i>functus officio</i> in respect of the
issue, to my mind the leave reserved in the judgment covers such an issue as
this.
<P>

39   	The Bank points out that in paragraph 925 of the Judgment,
the value of the NRS business at the time of its sale is found
to have been
$1.6 million and, the business having been sold for $691,000, it is concluded
that the sale realised $909,000 less than
the fair value of the business.  The
Bank points out that the business consisted of operations at four locations,
namely Tamworth,
Gunnedah, Narrabri and Moree.  Also that only the first three
operations were sold in June 1990 as the Moree business continued,
being wound
up in 1991.  The Bank then submits that an amount of $75,000 had been received
by the liquidator when he sold the plant,
equipment and stock of the Moree
branch.
<P>

40   	The Bank then submits that the measure of loss caused by
the Bank's breaches of contract should have been reduced by the above-described
$75,000.
<P>

41   	The Bank initially addressed submissions in support of the
proposition that there were other appropriate deductions said not
to have been
taken into account in the holding that the measure of loss caused by the Bank's
breach of contract was $909,000.  The
first of those matters was said to be
costs of the sale of the business and expenses involved in its marketing.  The
Bank initially
submitted that such costs ought to have been allowed for but
were not allowed for.  Subsequently the Bank determined not to press
these
submissions.
<P>

42   	The Bank initially submitted that had the business been
sold for its full value in June 1990, a significant part of the goodwill
would
have been subject to capital gains tax.  In this regard, the Bank referred to
paragraph 92 of the report of Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan
which was referred to in
the Judgment [paragraph 911] wherein Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan expressed the view
that Mr Hardy should have
taken into account the taxation consequences to NRS
of realising a capital gain on the sale of its business.  The Bank's submission
was that the Court should assume, in the absence of the plaintiff having led
evidence as to a lesser proportion being subject to
capital gains tax, that the
whole of the goodwill would have been subject to capital gains tax.  The
submission was that there ought
be a further deduction of $325,260 (39 per cent
of $834,000), representing the capital gains tax the plaintiff would have had
to
pay upon the sale of the business.  Again this submission was later not
pressed.
<P>

43   	In the result, the Bank's submission is that the holding
that the measure of loss caused by the Bank's breach of contract
was $909,000,
is appropriate to be revisited.  The submission is that the actual value
received on the sale of NRS's business is
to be regarded as $834,000 ($909,000
minus $75,000).
<P>

44   	The plaintiffs submitted that the Court was <i>functus
officio</i> in relation to this issue.  To my mind, the leave reserved to the
Bank in the Judgment does extend to permit the Court to deal with
a matter such
as this.  To my mind the Bank ought be permitted to raise the question of the
asserted sale of plant, equipment and
stock of the Moree branch to Currabubula
Holdings for approximately $75,000.  Mr Bryant/Mr Halligan in paragraph 91 of
their report
of April 1997, had used the words "<u>if the sale did occur</u>
then the loss, if any, in respect of NRS should be reduced by $75,000)".
<P>

45   	It being accepted as I understand it by the plaintiffs,
that the sale did occur, it seems to me the Bank has made good its
proposition
that the measure of loss caused by the Bank's breach of contract should be
reduced by $75,000 so that the measure of
loss becomes $834,000.
<P>

46   	In consequence, the various schedules relied upon by
Currabubula in support of its interest claims will be required to be
amended in
due course.
<P>

<b>INTEREST</b>
<P>

47   	Currabubula in written submissions, put forward its claims
to interest on four alternative bases.  They are as follows:-
<P>

<i>`(a)	Compound interest at Supreme Court rates from 1 June 1990 to
date;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Compound interest at the rates charged by the Bank from 1 June 1990 to
30 June 1992 and thereafter Supreme Court interest rate;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Compound interest at the rates charged by the Bank from 1 June 1990 to
30 June 1992, compound interest for the period 1 July 1992
to 30 June 1993 at
the rate charged by the Bank which re-financed Currabubula Holdings, and
following 30 June 1993 interest at Supreme
Court rates;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Simple interest from 1 June 1990 to April 1999 at Supreme Court
rates.'</i>
<P>

48   	A claim to interest charges unnecessarily incurred is
pursued in relation to interest charged by the Bank upon the sum of
$834,000.
The claim is that such interest is to be calculated on the same basis as the
Bank is said to have charged interest.  This
was initially said to have been
compounded monthly and in arrears.  Later, as I understood Mr Ryan during oral
submissions, the Plaintiffs
accepted that there was no evidence that the Bank,
during the period 1 June 1990 through to 30 June 1992, charged anything
otherwise
than simple interest and that there was no evidence that the
Commonwealth Development Bank during the period 1 July 1992 to 30 June
1993
charged anything otherwise than simple interest.
<P>

49   	The claim put in alternative (d) addresses the alternative
claim for interest, being simple interest at Supreme Court rates
for the whole
of the relevant period.
<P>

50   	Currabubula also submitted that it was entitled to recover
as a separate head of damages, interest pursuant to s 94 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</a></i> on the amount of damages held to have been $834,000.  However,
Currabubula, as I understand it, now accepts that it cannot receive
double
recovery.
<P>

51   	The Bank submits, as must be correct, that Currabubula is
only able to claim interest because of the finding that it has a
right to
recover, as damages, the loss in the value of NRS.
<P>

52   	Plainly, as the Bank submits, Currabubula cannot recover
`interest unnecessarily incurred', as well as interest under s 94
of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> from June 1990 to date.
<P>

53   	To my mind, and as I have indicated the Bank now accepting
this to be the case, the Court is entitled to find on the evidence
and/or to
infer from the evidence, that Currabubula would have applied any additional
funds available on the sale of NRS to further
pay down the Bank's facility on 1
June 1990.
<P>

54   	The Court referred in paragraph 382 of the Judgment to Mr
Booth's summary of a meeting which he held with Mr Paola on 16 January
1990, in
which summary Mr Booth stated that Mr Paola's strategy was to reduce Bank debt
to less than $5,000,000 as soon as possible
and that assets would be realised
until this was achieved.  In paragraph 926 of the Judgment the Court referred
to the Bank's knowledge
of the Group's plan first to sell the jet aircraft and
next NRS.  In Judgment paragraph 952, the Court set out sections of Mr Paola's
evidence under cross-examination, including his evidence that by April 1990 he
saw the Group getting itself into a wholly unacceptable
financial position
later in the year unless Durhambone could be sold quickly.  In paragraph 956,
the Court referred to Mr Paola having
recognised that there was a pressing need
to reduce the Group's indebtedness to the Bank both to honour the term of the
facility
which required the end of May reduction and also to alleviate the
Group's over-stretched financial situation.  The holding was that
on the
evidence, this was an over-stretched financial situation which in Mr Paola's
personal view, was simply intolerable and had
to be addressed.
<P>

55   	In paragraph 959 the Judgment includes the following:
"Even had the plaintiffs received the additional $909,000 upon the sale
of NRS,
that would have been far from achieving the reduction in Bank debt below
$5,000,000 that in Mr Paola's view was necessary".
<P>

56   	In those circumstances, to my mind, the interest question
ought be decided upon the basis now conceded by the Bank, that Currabubula
would have applied any additional funds available on the sale of NRS to further
pay down the Bank's facility on 1 June 1990.
<P>

57   	Turning now to the question of interest to be calculated,
the plaintiff submitted in reply that it was not necessary in order
to claim
compound interest, that a specific claim for the same be made in the pleadings,
and that the companies were trading companies
that used and re-used capital as
it became available to them.  The plaintiff submitted that it was appropriate
to award compound
interest in such circumstances.
<P>

58   	The Bank's submissions were as follows:-
<P>

<i>`The defendant submits that the proper measure of interest is that which
accrues at the Supreme Court rates from 1 June 1990.  Further
the interest
should be calculated on a "simple interest" basis - a claim for compound
interest must be pleaded as part of the Plaintiff's
case and supported with
evidence and the Plaintiff did not do so here.  The Defendant accepts the
Plaintiff's calculations in Annexure
D.</i>
<P>

<i>Even if Currabubula is entitled to make a claim for interest for "interest
unnecessarily incurred", the proper measure is the interest
accruing on the
amount of $909,000 (assuming Currabubula is awarded damages for this amount) at
the interest rate payable under the
Bank's facility until the facility was paid
out on 30 June 1992.  There is no evidence that the Bank charged the Group
compound interest
during this time nor that in the period since 30 June 1992
the Plaintiff has had to pay compound interest and so Currabubula would
not be
entitled to be compensated on this basis.  Furthermore there is no evidence
that Currabubula as opposed to some other company
in the Group paid the
"interest unnecessarily incurred" and therefore no factual basis for an order
allowing it to recover that interest'.</i>
<P>

59   	In <i>Hobartville Stud Pty Ltd v Union Insurance Co
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 358</a> Giles J at 364, made plain that a factual
investigation into the loss suffered through being held out of the money is
appropriate
so that the plaintiff's loss is to be found as a fact and not
assumed from a mere withholding of the money.  The question of whether
the Bank
charged compound interest during the relevant period or whether the plaintiff
had otherwise had to pay compound interest,
remains therefore, one of fact.
<P>

60   	The parties, as I have said, ultimately accepted that
there was no evidence as to the amount of interest charged by the Commonwealth
Development Bank, as I understood it, and the evidence being that the Bank
charged only simple interest from 1 June 1990 to 30 June
1992.
<P>

61   	In all of those circumstances, in my view, the appropriate
interest award is that identified in the plaintiff's alternative
(b), subject
only to this being simple interest, that is to say simple interest at the rate
charged by the Bank from 1 June 1990
to 30 June 1992 and Supreme Court interest
rates from 1 July 1992 to date.
<P>

62   	In so far as the amount which had been claimed in
alternative (b) is concerned, those figures had been on the basis of compound
interest for the period 1 June 1990 to 30 June 1992.  On that basis, and on the
basis of simple interest rate claim thereafter and
with an opening balance of
$909,000 the claim had been to $2,643,107.52.  The measure of loss caused by
the Bank's breach now being
reduced, as I have earlier said to $834,000, and
the appropriate interest rate being determined to be simple interest, it is
necessary
that the interest figures be recalculated on these bases.
<P>

63   	The plaintiffs will be required to bring in a schedule
setting out the correct figures for the altered claim which the plaintiffs
have
made out.
<P>

64   	It remains then to deal with costs.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

65   	The plaintiffs submit as follows:-
<P>

`<i>(a)	There is no reason why the general rule as to costs should not apply in
this case.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Costs should follow the event.</i>
<P>

<i>(c) 	The plaintiff has been successful in establishing liability in respect
to its defamation claim and contract claim.  The defendant
has been wholly
unsuccessful in denying liability.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	There is no additional cost borne by the introduction of the second
plaintiff as the costs involved in that part of the case relied
upon and rested
with the evidence and submissions adduced for the first plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Currabubula has been successful on its breach of contract claim.  Paola
Holdings was added to ensure that there was "no standing
problem" and its
addition has caused no additional costs that have been identified by the
Bank.'</i>
<P>

66   	The Bank submitted that the plaintiffs should pay the
Bank's costs in relation to the issues on which the plaintiff was
unsuccessful:-
<P>

`<i>(a)	Paola Holdings was totally unsuccessful and should never have been
joined as a party and ought pay the Bank's costs involved in
the
joinder.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Currabubula should pay the Bank's costs in relation to the issues
involving the sale of Durhambone and Gabo.  These costs include
the whole of Mr
Spackman's fees.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Currabubula should pay the Bank's costs in relation to Ubix.  These
costs include all of the fees of Mr Lorrimer and Mr Partridge
and a significant
part of the Arthur Anderson fees.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Currabubula should pay that proportion of the Bank solicitors and
counsel's fees as are attributable to.'</i>
<P>

<i>-  valuation of the properties, the Ubix's shares, the deed of release, the
assertion that Currabubula was entitled to take representative
proceedings, the
estoppel claim, any issues relating to Paola Holdings.</i>
<P>

67   	The Bank submitted that to the extent that the Bank is
ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs in relation to the issues on which
the
plaintiff was unsuccessful, the Bank ought not be required to pay the
proportion of the plaintiff's costs of its solicitor and
counsel as referred to
in paragraph (d) above.
<P>

68   	In particular, it was submitted that a significant part of
Mr Hardy's fees should be disallowed on the basis that they relate
to the
valuation of the properties or the Ubix shares.
<P>

69   	To my mind, Currabubula, having substantially succeeded in
establishing liability in respect of its contract and defamation
cause of
action it is entitled, subject to one consideration, to the benefit of the
usual rule that costs follow the event.  The
matter to which I refer is the
undoubted fact that Currabubula failed to establish liability in the Bank on a
number of heads of
damage.
<P>

70   	Taking that matter into consideration, the appropriate
order is, in my view, that the Bank pay 90 per cent of Currabubula
Holdings'
costs of the proceedings.
<P>

71   	In relation to Paola Holdings, it has failed in
establishing any causes of action on which it sued.  However, it is fair to
say
that most of the costs of the Bank which were incurred in defending itself
against the claims brought by Paola, were the very
same costs as were incurred
in its defence to Currabubula's claims.
<P>

72   	Mr MacFarlan QC submitted, on behalf of the Bank, that the
position with respect to Paola Holdings was that it simply did
not succeed and
as I understood the submission, that Paola Holdings should pay the Bank's costs
of the proceedings or of the proceedings
in so far as they involved Paola
Holdings' claims.
<P>

73   	The circumstances in which the Paola Group was joined were
somewhat unusual.  The question of locus remained a matter for
decision of the
trial judge - the matter is generally referred to in the Judgment.
<P>

74   	Mr Ryan submitted that it was not appropriate to punish
one group of plaintiffs in the present proceedings.  The submission
was that
because one plaintiff is present in the proceedings to ensure that any standing
problems are overcome, it is inappropriate
to visit upon that unsuccessful
plaintiff the costs of the proceedings and thereby to effectively deprive the
successful plaintiff
of its costs.  Mr Ryan submitted that a qualification to
this proposition was where the Court could identify substantial segments
of the
case which related to, and only to, the unsuccessfully joined plaintiff's
suit.
<P>

75   	Mr Ryan submitted that it was incorrect to view the case
as one in which both plaintiffs substantially failed.  Mr MacFarlan
had
submitted earlier that the appropriate way to view the proceedings was that a
claim of $31.84 million had been particularised
and a damages liability found
in the order to which I have earlier referred in this judgment.  Mr MacFarlan's
submission was that
in those circumstances, the plaintiffs had recovered
something less than 3 per cent of their claim and that in perspective, this
is
an extreme case where the plaintiffs were effectively unsuccessful, having
succeeded only in very small measure in relation to
Currabubula alone.
<P>

76   	Mr Ryan submitted that it was incorrect to view the case
as one in which both plaintiffs substantially failed.  He submitted
that
Currabubula had succeeded in its contract claim and in its defamation claim.  I
accept Mr Ryan's submission that the vast majority
of the trial involved the
question of whether the Bank had breached its contractual obligations and had
defamed Currabubula.  The
parties engaged in each presenting a vigorous case,
the plaintiffs in support of the proposition that the contract had been
breached
and that Currabubula had been defamed and the defendant negating those
propositions.  It seems to me, that it is simply not realistic
to suggest that
the case is to be properly viewed as one in respect of which the plaintiffs
effectively failed.
<P>

77   	Mr MacFarlan also addressed submissions suggesting that as
part of the Court's discretion, the Court ought take into account
the fact that
the Group was in default at material times in such a way that the Bank had been
entitled to terminate the facility
were it minded to do so.
<P>

78   	To my mind, that consideration requires to be very
carefully addressed indeed.  The Bank through the whole of the proceedings
accepted that it relevantly, save for one particular alternative, had not
sought to terminate the facility.  The suggestion then,
that the Group having
been found to be in default in such a way that the Bank was entitled, had it
been disposed to do, so to terminate
the facility, should be taken into account
in some special way in the exercise by the Court of its discretion, is
therefore rejected.
<P>

79   	To my mind, the appropriate order here is that Paola
Holdings pay 20 per cent of the Bank's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

80   	I direct that the plaintiffs bring in short minutes of
order to deal with the final orders and unless there is something which
either
counsel suggest that I have forgotten about I would propose to adjourn.
<P>

81   	I earlier referred to the plaintiff's objection on a
functus officio basis, to the Court revisiting the question of calculation
of
quantum of damages.  To my mind the leave which had been reserved to the
parties to address further submissions, which is to be
found in the last
paragraph, paragraph 1124 of the judgment, was entirely appropriate to include
a matter such as that.  On the other
hand that leave would not have extended in
any way to permitting, for example, the Bank to revisit questions such as the
breaches
of contract alleged or the defamation which had been found or matters
of fundamental principle and central fact treated within the
judgment.
<P>

82   	In relation to the costs reserved on the application by
Paola Holdings Pty Limited to be joined as a further plaintiff in
the
proceedings, to my mind costs of and occasioned by that application ought be
regarded for the purposes of the proceedings in
terms of the whole of the
proceedings.  In short, the costs orders which I have made, and the short
minutes to be brought in by the
plaintiff, should embrace costs of and
occasioned by the application for joinder to be appropriately described as
costs as part of
the whole proceedings.
