Friday 5 March 1999
<P>

<b>No. 3588/94 GIOVANNI OLIVERI  v  MICHAEL JONES &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  <b>THE LITIGATION</b>
<P>

2	This is the hearing of an accounting and assessment of damages which arises
out of the principal proceedings which were determined
by Bryson J on 18
December 1996 and the Court of Appeal thereafter.  The proceedings concerned
the ownership of three properties.
 They were rural land at Silverdale and
Mulgoa and a block of four flats at 57 Station Street, Petersham.  Proceedings
had been brought
by the plaintiff, Giovanni Oliveri, seeking declarations as to
his ownership of these properties.  He succeeded before Bryson J and
the Court
of Appeal in establishing his ownership of the properties at Silverdale and
Mulgoa but failed in respect of the claim to
the Petersham property.  
<P>

	<b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

3	The Petersham property title was held in the names of two of the children of
Giovanni Oliveri, namely, Dominic Oliveri and Joseph
Oliveri.  Dominic Oliveri
is a graduate in Arts and Law and a legal practitioner.  He completed his
studies and became a solicitor
in 1982.  He was made bankrupt under a
sequestration order dating back to 23 December 1993.  In these proceedings
brought by the
father there was also a cross claim by Mr Jones as trustee of
the bankrupt estate of Dominic Laurence Oliveri.  That cross claim
includes
claims relating to the occupation of the Petersham property to the exclusion of
the trustee from 23 December 1993 until
3 February 1997.  In respect of that
occupation of the property there are a number of matters which are common
ground between the
parties.
<P>

1.	Emanueli Oliveri, another son of the plaintiff, Giovanni occupied unit 1
rent free from some time in 1990.
<P>

2.	Prior to his occupation unit 1 was occupied by Dominic Oliveri.
<P>

3.	The rental value of each unit including unit 1 was $170 per week over the
relevant period.
<P>

4.	Since 1990 and certainly during the period in which this assessment is
concerned, namely from 23 December 1993, Emanueli Olivieri
managed the block of
flats as well as residing therein.  
<P>

5.	In the course of management of the flats Emanueli collected the rent mostly
in cash and some of this was deposited to an account
in the name of Joseph
which had been opened for the purposes of paying the monthly repayments on the
bank mortgage.  That mortgage
was a 25 year term loan.  
<P>

4	Apart from declaring interests in respect of the three properties Bryson J
made the following orders:-
<P>

	"3. An account be taken of the dealing of the cross defendants with the
Petersham property subsequent to the sequestration order
made against the
estate of Dominic Laurence Oliveri.
<P>

	4. An enquiry be held as to the amount of damage suffered by the cross
claimant by reason of the conduct of the cross defendants
in dealing with the
Petersham subsequent to the sequestration order made against the estate of
Dominic Laurence Oliveri."
<P>

5	The cross defendants to that cross claim are Giovanni Oliveri, his children,
Joseph Oliveri, Emanueli Oliveri, Rosa Oliveri and
Saverio Oliveri.  Giovanni
Oliveri, Joseph Oliveri, Rosa Oliveri and Saverio Oliveri have all sworn
affidavits as accounting parties
stating that they have received nothing from
the property in the relevant period.  They were not in physical occupation of
any of
the units in the block of flats.  There does not seem to be any dispute
on this aspect as clearly the property was managed for the
relevant period by
Emanueli Oliveri.
<P>

	<b>CLAIMS MADE IN THE ACCOUNTING</b>
<P>

6	A claim is made against the father, Giovanni Oliveri.  This claim is based
upon the allegation that he asserted a claim for ownership
and denied the
trustee of the bankrupt estate of his son, Dominic, occupation and the benefit
of the property.  The second claim
is against Emanueli Oliveri which claim
relates to his management of the three units, namely, units 2, 3 and 4 which
were rented
during the period and his occupation rent free of unit 1.
<P>

	<b>BASIS OF CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF UNITS 2, 3 AND 4</b>
<P>

7	It is useful first to look at how the claims in respect of units 2, 3 4 are
propounded by the trustee.  The orders made by His
Honour contemplate an
account of the dealing with the property and enquiry as to the amount of
damage.  In the present enquiry I
am dealing with a number of different aspects
in respect of different claims.  There is not one claim as commonly occurs in,
for
example, misuse of confidential information where it is necessary for a
party to elect whether to have an account of profits or damages.
 Normally such
an election has to be made at least by the time the accounting commences.  His
Honour in referring to an account in
order 3 is clearly contemplating an
account of what occurred in respect of the management of units 2, 3 and 4 which
were rented during
the relevant period.  There is no doubt that Mr Emanueli
Oliveri was in receipt of the rents in the relevant period and would be
liable
for money had and received in respect of these matters. The fact that the
trustee is entitled to an accounting in the present
circumstances does not seem
to be disputed and is in fact one of the oldest examples of liability arising
from wrongful assumed authority.
 See the cases and references collected at
note 23 on page 697 of Goff &amp;  Jones, <b>The Law of Restitution 5th
Edition</b>.  The nature of the account would probably fall within that group
of cases which has been described as "the vaguely defined number
of cases where
an account would be too complicated to settle at law or to be left to a
jury".
<P>

	<b>JUST ALLOWANCES UNITS 2, 3 AND 4</b>
<P>

8	The one matter of principle which needs to be addressed in respect of this
claim is whether or not Mr Emanueli Oliveri is entitled
to a just allowance for
his time and effort in managing the property.  The detail of this claim is set
out in Annexure C to his affidavit
of 23 November 1998 and in substance it is a
claim for 7 percent of the income rental received each year plus a week's
rental for
the commencement of each new tenancy. 
<P>

9	Part 48 rule 7 which would seem to also apply to accounts in equity provides
that in taking the account all just allowances will
be made.  One most commonly
sees just allowances being dealt with in claims against fiduciaries or in
respect of a constructive trust.
 The present case, apart from being an
account, is also a claim for money had and received.  Just allowances are
allowed in such
cases.  For example in <b>Dale v Sollet </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1767/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1767] EngR 5</a>; (1767) 4 Burr 2133;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=98%20ER%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">98 ER 112</a> the court was concerned with an action for money had and received for
the plaintiff's use.  The defendant, a ship broker, acted as
the plaintiff's
agent in recovering a sum of 2000 pounds for damages done to the plaintiff's
ship.  Of this sum he retained 40 pounds
for his labour.  The jury found this
was a reasonable allowance.  At the trial the plaintiff had objected that a
reasonable allowance
was not available but that a set-off should have been
pleaded.  The argument was successful subject to the opinion of a higher
court.
<P>

10	It was held at p 43 by Lord Mansfield with the concurrence of two other
judges that:-
<P>

	"This is an action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use.  The
plaintiff can recover no more than he is in conscience
and equity entitled to:
which can be no more than what remains after deducting all just allowances
which the defendant has a right
to retain out of the very sum demanded.  This
is not in the nature of a cross-demand or mutual debt: it is a charge which
makes the
sum of money received for the plaintiff's use so much less"
<P>

11	In <b>Moses v Macferlan </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1760/713.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1760] EngR 713</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281760%29%202%20Burr%201005" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1760) 2 Burr 1005</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=97%20ER%20676" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">97 ER 676</a> in a discussion of
the remedy, Lord Mansfield stated (at 1010; 679) that a party sued for moneys
had and received for the plaintiff's
use 
<P>

	"can be liable no further than the money he has received; and claim every
equitable allowance;...he may defend himself by every
thing which shews that
the plaintiff, ex aequo &amp; bono, is not intitled to the whole of his demand,
or to any part of it."
<P>

12	"Just allowances" has a long history being referred to in <b>Lord Provost of
Edinburgh v Lord Advocate</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%204%20AC%20823" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 4 AC 823</a> as including everything which the
court might think just and proper.  There is a useful discussion of the
principles in <b>Kalyk v Whelan</b> a decision of Justice Bryson (unreported
31.8.88).  There His Honour said:-
<P>

	"There are no closely defined principles for determining what allowances are
to be made and the allowances to be made must be made
on the basis of the
perceived justice of each case and as an aspect of the decision to enforce a
constructive trust.  Such a wide
range of facts may give rise to a constructive
trust that generalisation about the principles on which allowances are made are
difficult.
 In <b>Boardman v Phipps</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1966/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%202%20AC%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 2 AC 46</a> the constructive
trustees were to receive an allowance of the sum '..proper to be allowed to'
(either of them) 'in respect of his
work and skill in obtaining the said shares
and the profits in respect thereof' and the payment was to be on a liberal
scale: see
at pages 104 and 112.  The Court of Appeal reviewed authorities in
United States Surgical Corpn v Hospital Products International
Pty Ltd.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20NSWLR%20157" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983)
2 NSWLR 157</a> at 241 to 423.  The Court of Appeal referred to the vagueness of
the expression 'just allowances' and to the vagueness of the underlying
principle - see 242 C-D.  They withheld an allowance in that case because of
the gross character of the breaches and the circumstances
in which they were
committed, including fraud.  They did not, it seems to me, establish that the
presence of fraud disqualifies a
constructive trustee from any just allowances.
They cited (at 242A) a passage from the judgment of Upjohn J in <b>Re Jarvis
Dec'd </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%201%20WLR%20815" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 1 WLR 815</a> at 820 which includes the statement:- 'Each case
must depend on its own facts and the form of inquiry which ought to be directed
must vary accordingly to the circumstances.' This seems to be echoed in his
Lordship's statement (in dissent) in <b>Boardman v Phipps </b>at 123:- 'Rules
of equity have to be applied to such great diversity of circumstances that they
can be stated only in the most general
terms and applied with particular
attention to the exact circumstances of each case.' The High Court reversed the
decision of the
Court of Appeal: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">156 CLR 41</a>; but in my opinion the passage to
which I have referred continues to be entitled to my respect and there are some
observations in
the High Court which are to similar effect. (at page 79)
<P>

	I refer in particular to Mason J at 110 (and Mason Js citation from Cardozo J
in <b>Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281919%29%20225%20NY%20380" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1919) 225 NY 380</a> at 389: 'A Court
of Equity in decreeing a constructive trust is bound by no unyielding formula.
The equity of the transaction must
shape the measure of relief."
<P>

13	The claim for a management fee in this instance is clearly in respect of the
functions which Mr Emanueli Oliveri did in managing
the property particularly
units 2, 3 and 4.  This included obviously the collection of rent, organising
cleaning, repairs, supervising
vacating and incoming tenants, arranging for new
tenancies and generally looking after the property.  The claim by the cross
defendants
of 7 percent probably stems from the fact that in 1993 the
regulations under the <b>Auctioneers and Agents Act</b> prescribed 7 percent of
the gross weekly rental as a maximum amount to be charged for agents'
commission.  I have on a previous occasion
in <b>Pollicino v Pollicino </b>21
March 1996 discussed the allowance of such management fees in the context of a
fiduciary claim as a just allowance.  See pages
19 and 20 of that judgment. 
<P>

14	A submission was made to the effect that s 42 of the <b>Property, Stock and
Business Agents Act </b>1941 prevents an unlicensed agent from recovering any
commission fee, gain or reward for service as a real estate agent.  The
definition
of "Real Estate Agent" in section 3 imports the need for there to be
the carrying on of a business.  In my view such provision would
not prevent a
just allowance as the activities could not be described as a business.  It is
an allowance by the Court of some countervailing
amount in order to reflect the
personal effort expended by the accounting party in managing a property in
which his family had an
interest.  Having regard to the matters to which I have
referred to in my judgment in <b>Pollicino v Pollicino</b> at page 20, I would
have fixed an allowance of 3 percent of the rental collected and one half of
various weeks claim for new tenancies.
 However, no evidence of what is the
normal rate at the relevant time has been led before me.  The trustee's concern
seemed to be
with the principle of the allowance.  In the circumstances, if the
parties do not agree, I will fix the amount as indicated if evidence
called by
the defendant shows that 7 percent and one week's rent is the usual rate.
Later in this judgment I will deal with the remaining
details of the claim for
the accounting in respect of units 2, 3 and 4.  
<P>

	<b>BASIS OF CLAIM AGAINST GIOVANNI OLIVERI FOR UNITS 2, 3 AND 4</b>
<P>

15	There is also a claim against Giovanni Oliveri in respect of this
accounting.  The primary claim made against Giovanni Oliveri
was that Emanueli
Oliveri acted by his authority and on his instructions and was, for relevant
purposes, the agent for Giovanni Oliveri.
<P>

16	On a factual basis there is no doubt that Emanueli Oliveri believed that he
was managing the property which belonged to his father.
 His collection of rent
and payment of the mortgage may have benefited him after his father's death but
at the relevant time he had
no entitlement to the rent. There is also no doubt
that Giovanni Oliveri believed that his son, Emanueli Oliveri, was managing the
property by collecting the rent and paying the mortgage.  Although he was not
concerned about the rent he clearly believed he was
the owner of the property.
Emamueli, in my view, was his father's agent for the purpose of managing the
property including the collection
of rent.  However, this arrangement was not
known to the trustee at the time of commencing its cross claim.
<P>

17	Cases were cited in support of the proposition that if an agent receives
money on behalf of his principal and deals with it on
his principal's
instructions then the principal is liable to anyone who has made a claim on the
money.  They were <b>ANZ v Westpac</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d88%29%20164%20CLR%20662" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-88) 164 CLR 662</a> at 681, <b>Burt v
Claude Cousins</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%202%20QB%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 2 Q.B. 426</a> and <b>Rahimtoola v Nizam of Hyderabad
</b>(1957) 3 All ER at 453.  The first of these cases however dealt with the
situation where the agent has before receiving any notice
of a claim paid out
the money in respect of which he has been dealing to his principal or to others
on behalf of such principal.
 Such a factual basis has not occurred in this
case.  There was no suggestion that any payments were made by Emanueli Oliveri
to
his father.  In fact the evidence is to the contrary.  He did apply some
part of the rent on his father's behalf and it is only the
balance of the rent
still retained by Emanueli Oliveri with which I am concerned.  The second case
concerns the ability to recover
a deposit paid to an estate agent for a land
purchase where a contract for sale does not eventuate.  The case really was
determined
on the basis which of two innocent parties should bear the loss and
little assistance is gained from it.  It has been overruled in
<b>Sorell v
Finch </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1977%20AC%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1977 A.C. 728.</a>  The third case essentially held that where the
principal is a foreign sovereign and immune from suit the rule as to wrongful
payment
does not enable the agent to be sued.
<P>

18	The difficulty in the matter arises because the traditional analysis of the
liability of an undisclosed principal for repayment
is invariably dealt with in
the context of a claim for payment by a person who made the payment (perhaps by
mistake) to the agent.
 Such a person would be the tenant in this case.  As is
demonstrated by <b>ANZ v Westpac</b> the agent may have a good defence if
before notice of the claim he has paid it to the principal or done something
equivalent thereto.
 In this circumstance the claimant must look to the
principal.  But that is not this case.  
<P>

19	The basis for recovery against Emanueli Oliveri arises because an account
lies when a person intervenes without right to collect
another's rents.
Whenever an account lies indelitatus assumpsit will be available and hence the
claim for money had and received.
 Since <b>Arris v Stukeley</b> (1677) 2 Mod
260 it appears clear that recovery is allowed, not because a tort had been
committed but because an account lay.
<P>

20	If one turns to general principles of agency one finds that an undisclosed
principal may be sued in respect of money paid or
received on his behalf by his
agent acting within the scope of his actual authority.  See <b>Bowstead on
Agency </b>15th Edition Article 79.  In this case, Emanueli Oliveri was, in
collecting rents, acting within the scope of his actual authority.
 It is also
a general principle of agency law that an agent is not personally liable to
repay money received by him for the use of
his principal.  See <b>Bowstead on
Agency </b>Article 118 Rule 1.  There are exceptions one of which is when the
money is obtained by means of a wrongful act to which the agent
is a party.
The collection of someone else's rents without an entitlement could be
described as wrongful even though such wrongfulness
may not legally ground
recovery.  An example of this exception is that of an agent who acts for an
executor de son tort is, himself,
an executor de son tort and personally liable
to account for assets collected by him, even after he has paid them to his
principal.
 See <b>Sharland v Mildon </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1846/750.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1846] EngR 750</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281846%29%205%20Hare%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1846) 5 Hare 469</a> and <b>Padget v
Priest </b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1787/205.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1787] EngR 205</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281787%29%202%20TR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1787) 2 T.R. 97.</a>  There is no reason why such a principle should
not apply to someone who collects rents to which neither he nor his principal
is
entitled.
<P>

21	In these circumstances it would seem, as a matter of principle, that
Giovanni Oliveri should be liable jointly with his son,
Emanueli Oliveri, for
this claim.
<P>

22	The alternative claim in this area propounded against Giovanni is for
damages for having denied the trustee's title and kept
the trustee out of
possession by pursuing his claim to be the owner.  It was suggested that the
evidence of income and outgoings
is indicative of what the damages would be and
in contrast with the first claim the trustee concedes that some allowance for
management
can be made.  For reasons which I will advance later when dealing
with the claim in respect of unit 1, it seems to me that this alternative
could
not succeed.
<P>

	<b>BASIS OF THE CLAIM FOR UNIT 1  </b>
<P>

23	I turn to the claim in respect of unit 1.  The principal claim is against
Emanueli Oliveri he being the person in occupation
for the relevant years.  The
first claim is one in trespass.  It was submitted that upon entry into
possession, which the trustee
was ultimately able to achieve, he was entitled
to damages from the date upon which his right to possession arose.  Clearly the
right
to possession accrued on 23 December 1993.  However, the trustee did not
enter upon the premises until after judgment was given by
His Honour Bryson J
in December 1996.  The trustee referred to three cases, namely, <b>Ocean
Accident v Ilford </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281905%29%202%20KB%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1905) 2 KB 493</a>, <b>Ebbels v Rewell </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1908/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1908] VicLawRp 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%20VLR%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) VLR 261</a>
and <b>Wynn v Green </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1901/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1901] NSWStRp 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%201%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) 1 SR (NSW) 40</a> in support of the proposition. An
alternative claim was also propounded by the trustee.  That was that he was
entitled to succeed
in ejectment and thus there would be an entitlement to
mesne profits.
<P>

24	Both of these submissions overlook the fundamental nature of a claim for
mesne profits which is based upon the doctrine of "trespass
by relation".  The
basis of the claim received careful attention from the High Court in
<b>Minister of the State for the Interior v R.T. Co Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20107%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 107 CLR
1.</a>  In that case Taylor J was concerned with a claim for mesne profits made
after a resumption of certain premises.  After resumption
which gave the
Commonwealth title it brought the proceedings.  They are thus similar in fact
to the present matter where the trustee
obtained title and the right to
possession by the effect of Dominic's bankruptcy.  As in the present matter the
<b>Minister of State for the Interior </b>did not obtain possession until after
the proceedings were commenced and this is fatal to the claim.  The matter was
explained by
Taylor J at pages 5 to 7 in these terms.
<P>

	"In support of the primary submission of the companies upon this branch of the
 case it was pointed out that a claim for mesne
profits is a particular form of
the action for trespass, that as such it is based upon an injury to the
plaintiff's possession and
that the plaintiff is enabled to recover only upon
the doctrine of trespass by relation. That is to say, that upon entering into
possession the plaintiff is deemed by a legal fiction to have been in
possession ever since his right to possession arose. But, so
the argument ran,
a plaintiff is not entitled to assert a claim to mesne profits until entry or
re-entry has taken place. The principle
upon which the submissions are based
are clearly established (see Tharpe v. Stallwood (1843) 5 M &amp; G 760, at pp

Torts 13th ed. (1961) p. 179 and Fleming on Torts 2nd ed. (1961) p. 80) and it
is too late in the day to deny that at
common law a plaintiff suing for mesne
profits could not, in general, succeed unless he proved that pursuant to a
right to do so
he had entered into possession. An exception seems to have been
made in the case of a plaintiff whose title had expired before an
entry had
been made (Fleming on Torts (supra) p. 50) and for many years it has been
permissible in a number of jurisdictions for
a landlord, after a holding over
without consent, to combine a claim for mesne profits with an action of
ejectment. Indeed, in Dunlop
v. Macedo  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281891%29%208%20TLR%2043" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1891) 8 TLR 43</a> it was held that in view
of the provisions of r. 2 of 0. 17 of the English Rules of 1875 this course
might be followed in an action
for possession against a trespasser
notwithstanding the fact that such a case did not fall within the provisions of
s. 214 of the
Common Law Procedure Act, 1852 (cf.Supreme Court Act 1958
(Vict.), s. 119, and Supreme Court Rules, 0. XVIII, r.2). But the proceedings
before me are not proceedings in ejectment or for possession and it is
unnecessary to consider how far, if at all, a claim for mesne
profits might be
joined with proceedings of that character in this Court. (at p6) 
<P>

	None of the cases relating to mesne profits to which I have referred deals
with a situation precisely the same as that which presents
itself in this case.
It is true, of course, that the cases consistently predicate that the plaintiff
must establish that he has entered
into possession of the subject premises. And
they do so in language which suggests that the accrual to the plaintiff of a
cause of
action for mesne profits is dependant upon the occurrence of such an
event. But none of the cases, as far as I can see, contemplated
a situation
such as the present where the writ was issued before entry and an entry, in
turn, preceded the trial. This case is, perhaps,
made even more unusual by the
fact that the plaintiff had obtained a warrant of possession some years before
the date when the suit
was instituted. The immediate question, however, is
whether a claim for mesne profits made independently of proceedings for
possession
must fail if it is made before the plaintiff obtains possession of
the subject premises. The answer to this question must, I think,
be in the
affirmative unless the fiction upon which trespass by relation is erected can
be made to do double duty. Upon entry the
plaintiff's possession is said to
relate back by virtue of the legal fiction to the time when his right to
possession arose. Can
the plaintiff, then, in these proceedings, having entered
after the issue of the writ, assert by force of the fiction that he was
in
possession at the date of the writ and, therefore, that his cause of action had
then accrued? Or, perhaps, to put it in another
way, is a plaintiff, upon
entering into possession, entitled to assert that, thereupon, he became
entitled to mesne profits "at the
time when they arose"? (Ocean Accident and
Guarantee Corporation v. Ilford Gas Company (1905) 2 KB, at p 499 ). It is,
however, the
contention of the companies that they are entitled to judgment if
it appears that if the matter had been investigated at the date
of the
commencement of the suit it would have been found that the plaintiff's cause of
action had not then accrued. To my mind principle
and authority admit of only
one answer to the problem; it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish the
existence of his cause
of action as at the date of his writ and the failure or
success of his action will not depend upon whether the trial takes place
promptly or happens to be delayed until after he has entered into possession.
It seems to me that the problem is analogous to that
which has arisen in cases
where a plaintiff has, before actual grant of administration, commenced
proceedings as an administrator.
Notwithstanding that upon grant the
administrator's title relates back to the death of the deceased whom he
represents it has been
consistently held that this element of retroactivity is
incapable of sustaining a writ issued before grant (Chetty v. Chetty  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281916%29%201%20AC%20603" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1916) 1

). (at p7)"
<P>

25	As his Honour indicates there is often a statutory basis to allow the
combination of a claim for mesne profits with an action
for ejectment.  In New
South Wales this is found in section 12 of the <b>Landlord and Tenant Act
</b>1899.  The section only applies to the case of landlord and tenant which is
not the present factual situation.  In any event there
was no claim for
possession in the cross claim and there has been no judgment for possession.
As the trustee did not obtain possession
until after judgment the claim must
fail.  In my view there is no entitlement to mesne profits.  That this result
should follow is
not surprising given that the action of trespass is available
only to those in possession at the time of the unauthorised entry.
 I note that
there could not be a claim for use and occupation as that is predicated upon
there having been in the past a relationship
of landlord and tenant.
<P>

26	Another alternative might be that there would be a right to damages in
equity under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s68</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> on the basis that a court would have
issued an injunction against the continuance of a wrongful act.  However, an
injunction to restrain
a trespass or threatened trespass normally will not be
granted unless there is likely to be irreparable injury.  See the discussion
in
<b>Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies</b>, Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, Third
Edition, at para 2122.
<P>

27	In any event there does not seem to any evidence of a request to Emanueli
Oliveri for access or possession of the unit.  He had
been put in possession by
his brother, Dominic in 1990, before Dominic's bankruptcy.  He was clearly
there with his father's permission.
 It is hard to see how, in these
circumstances, he has committed some wrongful act.  In my view the claim
against Emanueli Oliveri
in respect of unit 1 must fail.
<P>

	<b>CLAIM AGAINST GIOVANNI OLIVERI UNIT 1</b>
<P>

28	In dealing with the claim against Giovanni Oliveri in respect of unit 1 it
is perhaps useful to recount the evidence which relates
to what in the
trustee's submissions were referred to as an ouster or denial of title.  In
correspondence before action Giovanni
Oliveri has certainly claimed through his
solicitors a 100 percent interest in respect of the Petersham property.  In
July 1994 the
trustee sought access for the purposes of valuation and he also
gave notice that he intended to appoint a receiver of the rents in
order to
safeguard the position.  On 10 August the solicitor for Giovanni Oliveri said
that he did not agree that the trustee or
anyone on his behalf could have
access to the properties.  Shortly after this the proceedings were
commenced.
<P>

29		The claim is said to be primarily in trespass as a result of him putting
his son into possession.  As I have found that a claim
will not lie against the
son it can not on this basis succeed against Giovanni.  The claim was also
expressed to flow from the fact
that Giovanni in this action denied the
trustees title by claiming the equitable ownership of the property.  
<P>

30	The submissions fastened upon the use of the expression "denial of title" in
<b>Biviano v Natoli</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20695" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 695.</a>  That case concerned property held
jointly and the question which arose was whether certain actions did constitute
an "ouster" and
thus give rise to a claim for an occupation fee.  The court
held that a denial in the pleadings of the co-tenants title was sufficient
to
constitute an ouster.
<P>

31	Such denial is no doubt similar to the action of Giovanni Oliveri in
bringing the present proceedings and if the defendant were
a co-tenant such
proceedings would amount to an ouster.  At common law a co-tenant so excluded
could sue for ejectment and for mesne
profits.  See the discussion at p 700 of
<b>Biviano.</b>
<P>

32	However, the defendant is not the co-tenant of the plaintiff.  He is a
stranger who has established a superior title.  The rules
applicable to
co-tenants arise because of their unity of possession.  See generally the
discussion in <b>Foregeard v Shanahan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 206</a> AT 221-2.
<P>

33	Any right in the trustee against Giovanni must derive from the general
principles in respect of trespass.  As has been shown
earlier these do not
apply as possession was not obtained prior to action.  The claim against
Giovanni thus fails.
<P>

	<b>ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES</b>
<P>

34	When this matter was first set down no proper form of accounting had been
given by the accounting party.  Mr Emanueli Oliveri
had simply filed an
affidavit annexing various check butts and bank statements.  There was no
attempt to vouch any of the amounts
out of court.  In the course of directions
hearings I gave directions which had the result that Mr Emanueli Oliveri filed
an affidavit
sworn on 23 November 1998 in which he set out by way of annexed
schedules an accounting of income and expenditure.  The schedule,
annexure A,
is a listing of all the items of income and expenditure for yearly periods
commencing on 23 December 1993 the last period
being 23 December 1995 to 19
December 1996.  Although this finishes somewhat short of the period covered by
the accounting it is
accepted by the parties that appropriate amounts have been
paid after that period.  Schedule A relates to units 2, 3 and 4 and includes
charges for the items of expense which applied to the property generally, such
as rates and mortgage repayments.
<P>

35	Annexure B to his affidavit is a further schedule of income and expenditure
itemised in respect of unit 1 and thus relates to
that unit alone. 
<P>

36	Annexure C to the affidavit of Mr Emanueli Oliveri of 23 November is his
claim for just allowances as a result of his managing
the building and
lettings.  The total claim is for $6,086.  
<P>

37	At the commencement of the hearing there was admitted as exhibit 1, a
schedule, for the purpose of showing the attitude of the
trustee to the
accounting as identified by Mr Oliveri in his affidavit.  That exhibit on the
first page dealt with the claim in annexure
B to Mr Oliveri's affidavit which
concerned his occupation of unit 1.  The subsequent pages dealt with annexure A
to his affidavit
and concerned units 2, 3 and 4.  As the case progressed the
parties stance not unnaturally changed in respect of some of these matters
and,
accordingly, what I will do is deal with those matters which appear to me to be
in dispute and leave the parties to do the relevant
accounting exercise to
determine the final state of accounts following upon such determination.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	DETAIL UNIT 1</b>
<P>

38	I will first deal with schedule B to Mr Oliveri's affidavit concerning unit
1.  The first item in that schedule is item 1 income,
which income is shown as
nil.  I have already held that he is not liable for his occupation of unit 1.
If he had been liable the
relevant income would have been $26,520.  So far as
expenses are concerned the parties are agreed that the correct quantum of items
3 to 34 is $2,729.38.  The only other item in contention is item 35 which
relates to contributions to the mortgage between the 24
December 1993 and 18
February 1994.  The amount claimed is $749.  The basis for this claim was said
to arise from the fact that the
funds which had been collected by Mr Oliveri
and deposited to an account from which the mortgage payments were deducted have
been
taken by the trustee following bankruptcy.  It appears, however, that when
one considers the account there is a miscalculation and
Mr Oliveri concedes
that because two payments of mortgage amounts came out of the account at the
relevant time the first amount is
not payable.  The trustee on the other hand
contends that there should be an allowance the other way in the sum of $372
because the
mortgage paid for the rent collected that year from monies saved in
that earlier year.  Given that the accounting for rent and mortgage
payments in
annexure A is expressed to be for a whole year this submission would not appear
appropriate.  Accordingly, all that is
necessary, if it were necessary to
decide the matter, is to reject Mr Oliveri's claim for an amount for $749.  
<P>

39	I say, "if necessary" because I do not think that Emanueli Oliveri has
demonstrated an entitlement to recoup any of these expenses.
 There is no
suggestion that the trustee, knowing that he was carrying out these minor
maintenance matters, deliberately stood by
and let him incur the expenditure.
Mr Oliveri had the benefit of occupation and these expenses were simply an
incident of that occupation.
<P>

	<b>DETAIL UNITS 2, 3 AND 4</b>
<P>

40	I turn to the account contained in annexure A which is in respect of units
2, 3 and 4.  Before dealing with the individual items
it is worth noting that
in this account we are mostly dealing with falsifications and, accordingly, the
onus is on the accounting
party.  The other matter that should be noted at the
commencement is the extraordinary lack of records maintained by Mr Emanueli
Oliveri.  He well knew that a claim was being made by the trustee of his
brother's estate and accordingly one would have thought
that some care would
have been taken in regard to records.  His explanation for the somewhat abysmal
records he has kept is that
he never believed that he would have to account.
The lack of records was extensive.  He issued no rent receipts for the whole
period
of his management and he had no records such as a cash book dealing with
receipt of income and payment of expenses.  So far as receiving
the rent is
concerned most of it was received in cash and what few cheques were received
from one tenant were banked in the account
which was used to pay for the
mortgage.  When he received cash he mixed it with his own money and did not
differentiate.  Frequently
in respect of many of the claims he makes in this
accounting he has no records and merely provides an estimate based upon his
memory
of events many years prior to the time of him swearing his affidavit a
mere few days before the hearing before me in this matter.
 Fortunately, for Mr
Oliveri, the trustee has taken a somewhat realistic approach and has admitted a
number of claims which seem
reasonable but for which no proof was available.

<P>

41	The first items in dispute are items 4 to 7 which cover periods of vacancy
for the first year.  Eight weeks has been claimed
from 26 February 1994 to 17
April 1994.  In the second year he also claims 8 weeks item 76 and in the third
year he claims 3 weeks
for unit 2 between 10 and 30 November.  The only
documents which give any indication or allow any basis for the first claim are
three
advertisements which were placed in the Sydney Morning Herald.  These
covered a period of ten days with the possibility of one other
some time
earlier.  In cross examination he suggested that he may have looked at other
documents in the Federal Court but no such
documents were produced.  Given the
absence of documentation and the generality of Mr Oliveri's evidence I do not
accept this claim
except to the extent conceded by the trustee.  This
concession was that the trustee would allow a vacancy rate of one week per unit
per year.  The amount allowed is $510.  
<P>

42	Items 74 to 76. There was, once again, a short period of advertisement and,
for the reasons expressed above, the amount allowed
is $510.
<P>

43	Item 126. This claim in the sum of $510 should be allowed as it accords with
the trustee's concession.
<P>

44	Items 9 and 10 relate to no bond being available.  This is a loss of rent
for several units as a result of tenants vacating without
paying rent.  Mr
Oliveri was not able to recover as he did not hold any bond.  Under his
management of the units no written tenancy
agreements were executed and he took
no bonds from any of the tenants.  Cross examination seems to indicate that he
has some memory
of the occasion in the first year.  Thus on a factual basis, I
accept he did not receive the rent. In respect of items 78 for the
next year
his explanation at transcript 67 and 68 was not consistent with the only
document available and I would not accept it on
a factual basis.  In the 3rd
year the claim is not made.  The failure to obtain a bond in the first year was
a clear breach of proper
prudence in managing the property.  However, there has
not been an order for the taking of accounts on the basis of wilful default
which would have meant that the accounting must be for not only receipts and
payment actually received and made by him but also for
all monies he would have
received if he had managed the property prudently.  As the matter is not a
mortgagor and mortgagee case
there is no entitlement to an account on the basis
of wilful default unless at least one example of wilful default is alleged in
the pleadings and proved at the trial.  This did not happen and, accordingly,
the amount of rent not received in the first year must
be taken into account in
favour of Emanueli Oliveri.
<P>

45	Item 18. Water rates.  This item was calculated by Mr Oliveri from one
quarter's voucher which included charges for arrears and
probably some recovery
fees.  An examination of cheque butts showed that the most likely amount for
rates for the year is $1,615
and accordingly this amount should be allowed and
$176.80 rejected.  Water rates also occurred in subsequent years at item 86
where
the correct amount to be allowed is $1,687.60 leading to a rejection of
$104.20.  Mr Oliveri agrees with this rejection.  In the
third year water rates
are item 140.  Based upon the cheque butts the correct allowance should be
$1,718.15 with $73.65 disallowed.
<P>

46	Item 22. Pest control.  This has been claimed in each year in the sum of
$444.  When one goes to the first claim at item 22 only
one account for $240
was produced.  There appears to be evidence of only two amounts, one of $240 in
this year and one for $220 somewhat
later.  Mr Oliveri says that it was done
every six months and he allowed the tenants to organise the treatment to suit
their convenience.
 I am prepared to accept his evidence as it is likely that
the tenants would not allow the matter to be left in abeyance.  Items
22, 90
and 14 are allowed in the amount claimed, namely, $440 each..  
<P>

47	Item 23. This is a claim for gardening in an amount of $200.  No dockets are
available and it is apparent that cash amounts were
paid from time to time for
gardening work.  This also appears at items 91 and 147.  The comment in
document 54 suggests that there
was a vegetation build up but I am not
satisfied that it establishes that gardening was not done.  I do accept that
some was done
and I am prepared to accept these figures given the small nature
of them.
<P>

48	Item 24. Lock replacement and key cutting at $300.  There are no documents
for these items and clearly it is a round figure estimate
with no detail.  It
should be disallowed.
<P>

49	Item 25. Security door repair.  This likewise has no documents and is from
recollection and given in a round figure.  It should
be disallowed.  
<P>

50	Item 26. Replace wrought iron and driveway gates $500.  This item is from
recollection only and no documentary proof and is a
round figure.  It should be
rejected.
<P>

51	Item 27. Roof repair $800.  This is the same as above and should be
rejected.
<P>

52	Item 28. Window repair $200.  This is the same as above and should be
rejected.
<P>

53	Item 33. Repair to rear fire escape landing $1,200.  There were three quotes
which were not accepted and instead Mr Oliveri said
he used a cash worker to
repair it.  He cannot recall his name but recalls the amount.  In the
circumstances and given the description
of the work I am prepared to allow this
amount.
<P>

54	Item 34. Professional cleaning $200.  This is a similar item to items 98 and
154 except that the latter two claimed $250.  No
records were available and the
figures are really estimates of what would be cash payments.  They are minor
amounts and I propose
to allow them as I am satisfied that cleaners were
engaged.
<P>

55	Item 56 on 24 June $74 for plumbing.  There is no document for this and it
is apparently a mistake.  Mr Oliveri agrees it should
be rejected.  
<P>

56	Item 97. Window repair sash cords.  There are no documents and cross
examination demonstrated no recollection of facts which
would support the
claim.  It should be disallowed.
<P>

57	Item 101. Emergency call $100.  This seems to be an error the date having
been taken from another document wrongly.  I would
disallow this sum.  
<P>

58	Item 102. Unit 2 May 1995 purchase of second hand stove $350. Item 105 unit
3 July 1995 purchase of second hand stove $300. 
There are no documents to
support these and they are merely from memory.  The recollection does seem to
have a basis because earlier
he had bought a new stove and on these occasions
he looked for second hand ones.  I am prepared to allow these amounts.
<P>

59	Item 110. $5,800.  These are costs for repairs to walls and rising damp.
There is produced an account from Mr Steve Toff which
details the work and
indicates that the amount has been paid.  It is suggested that no record could
be found of him as a plumber
but this is not conclusive particularly given that
Mr Oliveri says he met him at a coffee shop.  Given the documentation I am
prepared
to accept it.
<P>

60	Item 146. Fencing on the northern boundary.  There are no documents for this
and it was paid in cash.  However, there is a photograph
which shows a small
indication of new fencing.  In the circumstances I propose to allow this item
of $255.
<P>

61	Item 152.  Repair to a gas heater $175.  The claim for this arises from
document 55.  From my interpretation of that it seems
fairly clear that the
tenant is claiming $45 as an amount he paid to the repairer and accordingly I
would allow this amount in the
sum of $45.  
<P>

62	Item 149.  It should be noted that this amount is accepted in full at
$64.
<P>

63	Item 153.  It should be noted that this amount is accepted by the trustee in
full at $390.  
<P>

	<b>PROFIT ON SALE OF PROPERTY</b>
<P>

64	There was a suggestion in argument that because the trustee had now sold the
property at a price in excess of its value in 1993,
that he had made a profit
and no damage could be proved.  There is evidence before me that I accept which
sets out clear reasons
why the trustee could not sell the property before the
conclusion of the litigation.  However, there is no causal connection between
the cross defendant's management of the premises and the ultimate sale of the
premises by the trustee.  He was entitled to the benefit
of that sale whenever
it occurred.  See the discussion in a similar area in <b>Hussey v Eris</b>

<P>

65	I direct the parties to bring in short minutes, argue interest and costs and
deal with any remaining matters such as evidence
in respect of agent's fees.
