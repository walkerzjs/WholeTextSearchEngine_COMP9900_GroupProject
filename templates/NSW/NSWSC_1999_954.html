PTY LIMITED (subject to deed of company

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>OUTLINE</b>
<P>

1   	The applicants by notice of motion seek the Court's leave
pursuant to section 596C of the Corporations Law to inspect and copy
the
affidavit filed by the Administrators in support of an application for the
issue of examination summonses under section 596B
of the Corporations Law.  The
applicants also sought in the notice of motion orders that the summonses for
examination be set aside
or alternatively that the court directs the
examinations to be limited to certain issues.  However it was decided at the
beginning
of the case that the only issue for the court to determine at this
stage is access to the affidavit.
<P>

<b>BACKGROUND/FACTS</b>
<P>

2   	Peter Geroff and Gregory Moloney are the deed
administrators of Pegasus Gold Australia Pty Ltd (PGA).  In late 1997 PGA
commenced
proceedings in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory against
Bateman Project Engineering Pty Ltd, Kinhill Pacific Pty Ltd and
Kilborn
Engineering Pacific Pt Ltd (collectively known as BKK).  The proceedings were
later transferred to the Federal Court.  In
those proceedings PGA claims from
BKK loss and damage of approximately $340 million for breach of contract,
misleading and deceptive
conduct and negligence with regard to an expansion
project at the Mt Todd Gold Mine in the Northern Territory.
<P>

3   	In July 1999, the Deed Administrators successfully applied
to this Court for Examination Summonses pursuant to section 596B
of the
Corporations Law to require the attendance of the applicants for examination
about the examinable affairs of PGA.  The Administrators
also obtained under
Supreme Court Rules Pt 36 r12 an order for production of documents relating to
PGA's right of action against
BKK in the Federal Court Proceedings and the
capacity of BKK to meet any judgment obtained against it by PGA in those
proceedings.
 These applications for examination summonses were accompanied by
a supporting affidavit of the Administrators as required by section
596C, and
it is this affidavit which is the subject of this notice of motion.  The
applicants are Bateman Project Engineering Pty
Limited, Kilborn Engineering
Pacific Pty Ltd, Kinhill Pacific Pty Ltd and Messrs. Artis-Smith, Kinnaird,
Pickle, Harris and Stott,
these latter persons being either directors of one of
the defendant companies in the Federal Court proceedings or persons involved
with the project at a reasonably senior level.
<P>

<b>ISSUES</b>
<P>

4   	The question to be determined in this case is whether the
applicants should be given leave pursuant to section 596C of the
Corporations
Law to inspect and copy the affidavit of the Administrators. 
<P>

5   	Section 596C is as follows:
<P>

596C(1) A person who applies under section 596B must file an affidavit that
supports the application and complies with the rules.
<P>

596C(2) The affidavit is not available for inspection except so far as the
Court orders.
<P>

6   	The court has a discretion to order disclosure of the
affidavit to the applicants and should do so where the justice of the
case so
requires <b><i>- </i><cite>Re British and Commonwealth Holdings Plc (Nos 1 and
2)</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20Ch%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] Ch 342</a> at 345.  However the authorities make it quite
clear that it is not in every case that the affidavit will be made available
for inspection,
as that would make s596C(2) purposeless: See <b><cite>Simionato
v Macks</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19 ACSR 34</a> at 69.
<P>

7   	In particular an applicant will not be permitted access to
enable him or her to "fish" for a case, there must be material before
the court
from which it is clear that the applicant has an arguable case to which the
material is or may be relevant - <b><cite>Worthley v England</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2052%20FCR%2069" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
52 FCR 69</a> at 94.  More recently this was applied in <b><cite>Re Southern
Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq); Bond and Another v England</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997)
25 ACSR 394</a>  with Lander J stating at 422:
<P>

The authorities are clear that there is no right, on the part of an examinee,
to access to the material lodged in support of the
application for the
examination summons.  It is clear enough that while the court has a discretion
to allow an examinee to inspect
an affidavit supporting the application, which
discretion should be exercised in favour of the examinee where the justice of
the
case so requires, there must be some evidence before the court from which
it may be inferred that the examinee has an arguable case
and that the
affidavit material is relevant to that arguable case.
<P>

8   	Therefore the onus is on the applicants to show an arguable
case, meaning that the court must be satisfied to an appropriate
level of
satisfaction that they are not pursuing the application without good cause or
good reason - Nourse LJ in <b><cite>Re British and Commonwealth
Holdings</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20Ch%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 Ch 342</a> at 355.  There is further guidance as to
what an arguable case should relate to in <b><cite>Re Southern Equities
Corporation Ltd (in liq); Bond and Another v England at 432-3</cite></b>,
namely that the applicants must demonstrate an arguable case that the
examination summonses have been obtained for an improper purpose
and that
purpose being the predominant purpose of the administrator's application for
examination.
<P>

9   	In <b><cite>Re Moage Ltd (in liq)</cite><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25
ACSR 53</a> </b>Mansfield J commented on the threshold of the applicants having an
arguable case as he said at 67:
<P>

I think it is both inappropriate and sterile for the purposes of the present
applications to seek to attribute some scientific exactitude
to the degree of
satisfaction of "an arguable case" which needs to be made out by the applicant.
In my view it involves no more than
that the court requires to be satisfied to
an appropriate level of satisfaction that the applicant is not pursuing the
application
without good cause or without good reason, and in particular is not
doing so purely in the hope that, by procuring the release of
the affidavit,
some evidentiary foundation for the allegation will be made out.  In other
words, if the applicant is merely `fishing'
for a case, then no reason for
exercising the discretion in its favour will exist; if it presents material
from which it is shown
that it has passed the threshold beyond fishing, and has
an arguable case based on that material, then the discretion may be exercised
in its favour.
<P>

10   	Although this may seem to be a slightly lower threshold
than that expressed in <b><cite>Worthley v England</cite></b> and followed in
<b><cite>Re Southern Equities</cite></b>, the applicants still have to present
to the court good reasons for disclosure of the affidavit.  I agree that a lot
of the discussion
is a little sterile.  In simple terms, unless there is
evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the applicant for disclosure
has an arguable case as to improper obtaining of the summons then access should
not be allowed.
<P>

11   	It is now necessary to consider whether the applicants
have made out an arguable case to which the affidavit is relevant.
 The
applicants submitted that the Deed Administrators may be acting for an improper
purpose as the examination would be a trial
run or dress rehearsal of the
pending federal court proceedings, giving the administrators the opportunity of
trying to destroy the
credit of the BKK witnesses.  They also argued that the
actions of the Administrators are oppressive to BKK as they are distracting
them and their advisers from preparing for the Federal Court proceedings,
particularly in the voluminous nature of the documents
required for production,
which will interrupt the agreed protocol for discovery in the Federal Court
action.
<P>

12   	The Administrators submit that they were acting for a
proper purpose in their application for summonses made pursuant to section
596B
of the Corporations Law, which is as follows:
<P>

s596B (1) The Court may summon a person for examination about a corporation's
examinable affairs if:
<P>

	(a) an eligible applicant applies for the summons; and
<P>

	(b) the court is satisfied that the person:
<P>

(i)	has taken part or been concerned in examinable affairs of the corporation
and has been, or may have been, guilty of misconduct
in relation to the
corporation; or
<P>

(ii)	may be able to give information about examinable affairs of the
corporation.
<P>

13   	The administrator is clearly an "eligible applicant" as
the definition in section 9 states that an eligible applicant includes
"an
administrator of a deed of company arrangement executed by the corporation".
The administrators submit that there is no basis
to suggest that their purpose
is not to find out a) the extent to which BKK could satisfy a judgment debt;
and b) assess the claim
that PGA has against BKK and its likelihood of success.
These come within the definition of "examinable affairs" under section 53(a).
These purposes as stated by the administrators are clearly proper purposes for
such an application to be made.  <b><cite>In Re Moage Ltd</cite></b> Mansfield
J at 64 stated that 
<P>

it is established clearly by authority that it is a legitimate use of that
power by a liquidator to obtain information which might
assist in the conduct
of litigation.
<P>

he then went on to give examples of the specific purpose such as 
<P>

it may be sought to identify the nature and extent of evidence available to
support a claim in proposed or actual proceedings and
to determine the
probability or otherwise of success in those proposed or actual proceedings;
<P>

14   	The applicants argued that in this particular case the
examination would give PGA or the Administrators an advantage in the
pending
Federal Court proceedings, thus making their purposes improper.  However it was
held by Gleeson CJ in <b><cite>Hong Kong Bank v Murphy</cite></b> (1992) 28
NSWLR 512 at 519 that "the possibility that a forensic advantage will be gained
does not mean that the making of an order
will not advance a purpose intended
to be secured by the legislation.", and that it is entirely proper for the Deed
Administrators
to obtain information which may assist them in prosecuting
causes of action - <b><cite>Hong Kong Bank v Murphy</cite></b> at 520.
In<b><cite> Re Hugh J Roberts Pty Ltd (in liq) and Companies Act</cite></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%202%20NSWLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 2 NSWLR 582</a> at 584 Street J  found that the mere fact that questions
might be asked of an examinee directly involving a matter currently being
litigated between the company and the examinee does not render it an abuse of
process.  More recently in <b><cite>Re Southern Equities Corporation (in
liq)</cite></b>; <b><cite>Caboche v England</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20ACSR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 ACSR 582</a> at
589 Debelle J held that an examination process can be used for the purpose of
assessing the prospects of success and determining
whether the pending action
should be continued.  Therefore it is not an improper purpose to undertake an
examination whilst other
proceedings are pending.
<P>

15   	The other argument of the applicants is that there is or
may be a case the administrators purpose is improper and an abuse
of process
because of the voluminous nature of the documents to be produced, and the
disruption this would have on discovery in the
Federal Court action for which a
protocol has been established.  That does not in any way suggest an arguable
case which would justify
an exercise of discretion authorising access to the
affidavit.
<P>

16   	It is important to recognise that it is not necessary at
the present moment to decide on whether the summons should be set
aside.
However, the court looks at the persons summoned and the documents ordered to
be produced to see whether this might indicate
some improper purpose.  I have
not yet considered, except in a general way, the desirability of conducting the
examinations by directing
that they be limited in the first instance to matters
relevant to the financial position of the defendant companies.
<P>

17   	I have been reluctant to enter the debate on s596C(2) as
much as I have.  Discretionary decisions are just that, as long as
the
discretion is exercised in accordance with law and accepted principles.  The
principle is that the applicant for disclosure must
show an arguable case that
the summons ought not to have been obtained.  That has not been shown.  The
application for access should
be dismissed.
<P>
