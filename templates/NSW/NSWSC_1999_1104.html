TUESDAY 26 OCTOBER 1999

<P>

<b>4998/98 - DENNIS JOHN ROBSON &amp; 1 OR  v  DARLENE JOY McGRATH - ESTATE OF
BEVERLEY ELAINE BOARD</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in
respect of the estate of the deceased late Elaine Board, who died on 31 July
1997.  The deceased was survived by two children
of her first marriage, who are
the plaintiffs in the action, and her two children of a relationship with a Mr
Billet, one of whom
is the defendant.
<P>

 
<P>

2  	     The deceased's first and second husbands survived the
deceased.  However, Mr Billet, the father of Janine Charrington and
Darlene
McGrath, has died.  At the commencement of this hearing the plaintiff Mr Dennis
Robson withdrew his application for relief
and the plaintiff Lynn Potter has
proceeded.
<P>

 
<P>

3  	     There has been given before me evidence of a solicitors'
discussion with Mr Frank Robson as to whether or not he wished
to bring
proceedings.  Apparently he has decided not to, notwithstanding the fact that
he is an eligible person.  In these circumstances
the court can disregard any
possible claim by him.
<P>

 
<P>

4  	     A Mr Board was the deceased's second husband.  The marriage
to him was a short one of a year; they were married in 1964
and divorced in
1995. Although he has not been notified I have heard evidence that Mr Board had
a property settlement in which they
shared equally between them the matrimonial
assets at that stage.  Given there has been this property settlement, and the
lack of
contact thereafter, it would seem that the prospect of him having any
substantial claim or any claim indeed is so remote that the
court can disregard
his interest.
<P>

 
<P>

5  	     There is reference in the will of the deceased to children
of Mr Lance Murphy, with whom the deceased had a relationship
up until 1991.
The evidence before me indicates that those children were not part of the
household comprising the deceased and Mr
Murphy. Accordingly, they would not be
eligible persons.
<P>

  
<P>

6  	     The deceased's last will was made on 24 April 1992. This was
obviously made shortly after a dispute with the plaintiff
Mrs Potter.  Under
that will the deceased left the whole of her estate to her two daughters
Darlene McGrath and Janine Billet, as
she was then known.  In clause 5 the
deceased provided as follows:
<P>

 	<u>I HAVE MADE</u> NO provision for my son <u>DENNIS ROBSON</u> and <u>LYNN
MAREE POTTER</u> or my stepchildren being issue of my late husband <u>LANCE
DESMOND MURPHY</u>, <u>DESMOND MURPHY</u> and his daughter <u>LISA MAREE
MURPHY</u> as I am satisfied that all of these persons are able to maintain
themselves in life, according to their requirements; they are not
dependant
upon me nor were they dependant upon their late father for their support nor do
they contribute to any of the assets comprised
in either the estate of their
late father or of my estate. 	
<P>

 
<P>

7  	In respect of this provision, it is notable that the deceased did
not describe her relationship with Lynn Potter in contrast
to the other persons
she mentioned.  The deceased also referred to Lynn Potter and her stepchildren
being able to maintain themselves
in life according their requirements. The
situation that has emerged before me is quite different from what the deceased
has expressed
her belief to be.
<P>

 
<P>

8  	     The estate is a small one.  It consisted of the deceased's
house, which has been sold.  The estate has been totally reduced
to cash and
amounts to $155,617.56. If the plaintiff is successful there will be her costs
out of the estate.  There are also the
defendants' costs.  The defendant's
costs are estimated at $28,000 and the plaintiff's costs at $25,000, giving a
total of $53,000.
This would leave a net distributable estate of $102,617.56,
with some small adjustments to costs given that one of the plaintiffs
is not
proceeding.
<P>

 
<P>

9  	     I will deal with some of the history in order to put the
matter into context.  The deceased married Frank Robson in 1952.
 There were
two children of that marriage. The first was Dennis Robson, who was born on 23
September 1953, and the second, Lynn Potter,
who was born on 16 December 1959.
The following year they purchased a property at Swansea using borrowed funds.
The marriage did
not last long.  In 1962 the deceased and Mr Robson separated.
At that stage the plaintiff Lynn Potter was three years of age.  The
deceased
left the home and the children.  Thereafter the plaintiff and her brother were
looked after firstly by their father for
a short while and ultimately by their
grandparents.
<P>

 
<P>

10  	     In 1963 the deceased apparently began a relationship with
Keith Norman Billet. There were two children of that relationship,
Darlene
McGrath, who was born on 28 May 1966, and Janine Charrington, born on 3
November 1968.  That relationship also founded and
in 1972 Mr Billet left the
deceased and the two children Darlene and Janine.  At that stage Darlene was
six and Janine four.  Thereafter
they were brought up by their mother, the
deceased.  Given her circumstances, there was, no doubt, a difficult time for
the children.
There was little money to go around and they obviously had to put
up with things such as second-hand clothes as they grew up.
<P>

 
<P>

11  	     In 1974 there was a visit by the deceased, Janine and
Darlene to Swansea near Newcastle.  Up until that time neither 
of these
children knew of their mother's first marriage and the fact that she had
children by that first marriage.  They met Lynn
Potter for the first time.  At
this stage Lynn was 14.  It was the first time she had seen her mother since
she had been left by
her when she was three years old.
<P>

 
<P>

12  	     In 1981 Mrs Potter became pregnant and she, at the
instigation of her mother-in-law, tried to contact the deceased in
order to
tell her that she was going to become a grandmother.  She did not have any
contact address for her mother but using those
contacts that she could and also
using the help of the police she traced her mother.  She then established
telephone contact with
her.
<P>

 
<P>

13  	     In 1984 the deceased married Harry Board and there was
another visit at that stage to Swansea.  In 1985 the deceased and
Harry Board
divorced.  Probably in 1985 or 1986 the plaintiff Mrs Potter and her husband
borrowed $1,000 and used that to visit the
deceased at Townsville with their
daughter.  That was for a few weeks.
<P>

 
<P>

14  	     In 1989 Darlene married.  In 1990 the deceased moved from
Townsville and came to live at Caves Beach, which is near Swansea,
where the
plaintiff was living.  At that stage the deceased was in a de facto
relationship with a Mr Lance Murphy.  He died during
1991.  In 1992 there was
an argument or a dispute between the plaintiff Mrs Potter and her mother, the
deceased.  I will come back
to the details of that.  Thereafter a will was
made.  I have already set out the provisions.  The deceased died on 31 July
1997.
 Probate was granted in due course.
<P>

15  		In applications such as this under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the
High Court has recently in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out
the two-stage process the court must take at page 209 the court said the
following:
<P>

The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

	The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors." 
<P>

16  	     As directed by the High Court, it is necessary to look at
the plaintiff's situation and in particular her financial situation.
 She is
married with two children. One of them is in year 12 and aged 18 and the other
is in year 7 and aged 12.  The plaintiff herself
has little training. She left
school after the School Certificate in year 10 and she has had two jobs since
that time.  She has worked
as a process worker in a clothing factory for
two-and-a-half years and for Coles for two-and-a-half years.  She receives a
family
allowance of $420 per fortnight.  Her daughter Kelly has been receiving
Austudy, however, that will cease next week.
<P>

 
<P>

17  	     Her husband, because of the parlous state of his business,
is receiving a Job Start allowance of $527 per fortnight. 
They have between
them occasional drawings of about $100 per week, mainly to buy petrol, from the
business.  Lynn's husband is also
doing casual work as a bar attendant in order
to make ends meet.  Their assets are minimal.  There is an old Rover, which is
not
operable.  There is a Ford Falcon, repairs for which will cost more than
the car is worth.  There is also a Hiace truck, probably
used in the business,
worth about $1,500. They have minimal furniture and nothing else.  They live in
a Housing Commission flat and
pay rent of $89 per week.
<P>

 
<P>

18  	     Mrs Potter and her husband have liabilities which are
slowly startly to build up.  They owe school fees as far back as
kindergarten
amounting to $1,630, they owe ELCOM Credit Union $3,000 and Australian
Guarantee Corporation $1,100. The plaintiff owes
her father $2,500.  There are
business debts, no doubt debts of her husband of $6,400, however these debts
must impact upon the plaintiff's
situation.  The total amount of these is
$14,630.60.
<P>

 
<P>

19  	     The principal matter a court has to consider is the way in
which a plaintiff may have been left without adequate and proper
provision for
her maintenance, education and advancement in life.  It is only if the court
finds that there has been inadequate or
not proper provision that the court can
make an order. In the present case the plaintiff has presented her case as
needing something
for advancement in life.  She has no proposals to further her
education, but no doubt in a general sense, given her fairly straitened
circumstances, something to assist her in her daily living would be of
benefit.
<P>

 
<P>

20  	     Principally, the areas that she advances for consideration
are the repayment of her debts, the $14,630; the desire to
purchase some
furniture, which is not specified or costed; the desire to replace a motor
vehicle with a new motor vehicle.  There
is evidence before me that the cost of
a new Holden Olympic edition Commodore is $37,829. Notwithstanding that this
may be seeking
a car which is beyond what is appropriate, the general situation
of the plaintiff has to be taken into account.
<P>

 
<P>

21  	     The court also has to take into account others who have a
claim on the bounty of the deceased.  In the present case these
are two, the
first is, Darlene McGrath, a daughter of the deceased.  She is 33, married and
has two children aged seven and five.
 She and her husband own a home worth
about $180,000, upon which there is a mortgage of $95,000. Accordingly, they
have a reasonable
equity which they have build up in that home.  Darlene has a
car worth some $25,000 and her husband has a business, the details of
which are
not in evidence but at least he has a car worth about $20,000 in that business.
Darlene herself has income of some $12,000
as a finance clerk and her husband
presently earns about $35,000 per annum from his business.  They have minimum
superannuation.
<P>

 
<P>

22  	     Janine Charrington is 31.  She is married with two or
perhaps three children.  They are young, and certainly her elder
children are
presently aged four and two. She and her husband have a home worth $93,000,
which has a mortgage of some $69,000.  There
is a Pulsar car worth some $40,000
which she owns. Her husband has a car.  She has some superannuation
entitlements which will be
of assistance in the future.  Her income when she
was working as a shop assistant was about $20,000.  Her husband is a motor
vehicle
assessor and has an income of $39,000.  Clearly, both daughters are
starting out in life and acquiring the usual assets.
<P>

 
<P>

23  	     Importantly, both Darlene and Janine have had a good
relationship with the deceased during their lifetime.  They had a
fairly
Spartan upbringing, as I have mentioned.  Both, however, kept in contact with
the deceased, particularly after her move back
to Caves Beach.  They included
the deceased in their activities, tried to make sure that she was not lonely at
Christmas time and
enabled her to spend time with their families at that
time.
<P>

 
<P>

24  	     It is the relationship between the plaintiff Mrs Potter and
the deceased which is the matter of most concern in the case.
Having heard the
evidence, there appears to be some uncontroverted facts.  The first is that the
deceased left her when she was three
years of age.  She grew up with her father
and then with her grandparents. In 1974, when she was 14, she had this sudden
visit out
of the blue from her mother.  In 1981 communications started.  That
was at the instigation of the plaintiff.  Clearly, there were
further
communications, and there is evidence of letters and cards from the deceased to
the plaintiff.  These appear to have occurred
during the period in the eighties
until the deceased moved to Caves Beach in 1990.
<P>

 
<P>

25  	     There was also one contact, which was the visit to
Townsville in 1985 or 1986 to which I have referred. According to the
plaintiff
Mrs Potter, when her mother came to Caves Beach in 1990 her mother stayed with
her for some weeks while the house was made
ready. It seems that there was
contact between the plaintiff Mrs Potter and her mother up until 1992. In 1992
there was a serious
argument between the plaintiff Mrs Potter and her mother.
This is referred to in paragraphs 13 through to 18 of the affidavit of
the
plaintiff which are in the following terms:
<P>

	13.	Mum kept on saying to my daughter Kelly, "come to mummy" all the time and
she wanted Kelly to live with her.  I said to Mum,
"she is your granddaughter
mum, not your daughter".  Mum just kept on saying it over and over again.  I
could not even chastise her
because my Mum would say "come to mummy".  I said
to Mum, "She is my daughter and I will say what she does".  Mum turned very
nasty.
<P>

	14.	Our car was off the road for three weeks getting fixed in my Dad's
garage.
<P>

	15.	My daughter has a friend that lived near Mums house.  Kelly went to her
friend's house to play.  I said to Kelly, "just go
and tell grandma that we
have had problems with the car and I will see her soon".  She slammed the door
in my daughter's face and
said, "just tell them its too late".  I then rang her
and she just said "nobody comes near me and you're taking my daughter'
away".
<P>

	16.	I was scared because I didn't want my daughter hurt in any way.
<P>

	17.	I have some letters, cards and photos of us together.
<P>

	18.	I loved my mother for the time I had with her, which was only a few years
of my life and I just did not want her to hurt me
anymore by thinking that my
daughter was hers.  I said to Mum, "you cannot make up for the years lost with
me, with my daughter".
 I just did not want to be hurt anymore.  I could not
allow myself to get as close as I would have liked to have been with my Mum
because I was afraid of being hurt again. 
<P>

 
<P>

26  	     This difference, which seems to have stemmed out of a
somewhat possessive attitude by the deceased towards the plaintiff's
child, has
had an effect on the plaintiff which I think she still seems to suffer from at
the moment.  I would have thought, given
the nature of the person that Mrs
Potter is and having seen her give evidence, that it could be quite frightening
for her that her
mother was showing these intentions and what might be
described as worrying or excessive affection for her daughter. Probably it
might be that Mrs Potter was not mature enough to be able to handle the
situation.  Certainly the way she dealt with it was to cut
off her mother from
all contact.  The will was obviously made just after this incident and
thereafter the plaintiff Mrs Potter and
her mother did not speak even though
they would pass each other in the street, as they lived nearby.
<P>

 
<P>

27  	      There is also evidence of complaint by the deceased that
the relationship with Mrs Potter was one which had a financial
interest as far
as Mrs Potter was concerned. There were also references in the evidence to the
children of Mrs Potter, after this
occurred, coming around to the deceased's
house, throwing stones in the pool and on the roof and generally probably being
spiteful
to the deceased. Mrs Potter denies that these events happened.
However, it seems to me that given the nature of young children and
particularly given what happened to Kelly when she went round to see her
grandmother, the evidence in respect of which I have already
set out above,
namely the fact that she had the door slammed in her face and was told it was
too late, that the children may well
have reacted this way and have done it of
their own initiative.
<P>

 
<P>

28  	     It is very unfortunate.  The chances of there being some
rapprochement I would have thought were pretty small.  The deceased
appears to
have thought she had been badly rebuffed by her daughter, and probably her
daughter felt that her happiness and also her
child's happiness was at risk.
It is to be remembered that the plaintiff had been abandoned by her mother when
she was three and
any further relationship has to contend with the history
which must have an effect on the parties.
<P>

 
<P>

29  	     The question is what has to be done about this break in the
relationship.  It is not submitted that the break is such
as to be conduct
disentitling to the extent that no order ought to be made.  Certainly the fact
that there was this break and that
the plaintiff took no steps to try and heal
the rift is a matter that has to be taken into account.  These matters are
always difficult.
 One has the deceased making statements to other people,
which may perhaps have sprung from a desire to justify herself. The deceased
does seem to have had some feeling that the plaintiff was depending on her and
seeking financial assistance.  That probably is a
result of the difficult
financial situation of that the plaintiff.
<P>

 
<P>

30  	     Ultimately one has to balance this along with the other
claims on the bounty of the deceased.  Clearly, her two daughters
to whom I
have referred do deserve the bequests which they have been given.  They have
supported their mother.  They had a difficult
time as they grew up.  For this
reason, one can understand the deceased making proper provision for them.
However this may be, there
is still the relationship of a mother and daughter
between the plaintiff and the deceased.  The deceased should have recognised a
duty to that daughter.
<P>

 
<P>

31  	     Having regard to the matters to which I have referred,
particularly considering the matters relating to the separation,
it seems to me
in dealing with an estate which is after costs a little over $100,000 that the
appropriate order is it that the plaintiff
Mrs Potter receive a legacy of the
$25,000.  Accordingly, the orders I make are as follows:
<P>

 
<P>

      1.  That the plaintiff Lynn Potter receive a legacy out of the estate of
the deceased of $25,000.
<P>

 
<P>

     2.   Interest not to run on the legacy if it is paid within one month, and
thereafter at the rate provided under the Wills,
Probate and Administration
Act.
<P>

 
<P>

     3.   The plaintiff Lynn Potter's costs on a party-and-party basis and the
defendants' costs on an indemnity basis be retained
or paid out of the estate
of the deceased.
<P>

 
<P>

32  	     The other matter that has to be resolved are the costs in
relation to the claim by Dennis Robson. He was a joint plaintiff
in these
proceedings and clearly, having filed affidavits, the defendants have had to
reply to the matters which he has raised. 
The defendants' affidavits deal with
his affidavits.  Although there are not a lot of paragraphs devoted to them,
they do always
require work on the part of the solicitors, whether it be in
conference, obtaining advice or otherwise.
<P>

 
<P>

33  	     The claim which Dennis Robson made was one which, given the
size of the estate, would have no chance of success.  He is
a person who has in
relative terms compared with the other parties large property entitlements
including amounts of superannuation
of some $98,000.  In these circumstances,
clearly one would have thought the decision was the right one and it is a pity
that it
was not taken earlier.  In the circumstances the appropriate order is
that the plaintiff Dennis Robson pay the defendants' costs
thrown away as the
result of the abandonment of the claim of Mr Dennis Robson, those costs to be
on a party-and-party basis.
<P>

 
<P>

     Exhibits to be returned.
