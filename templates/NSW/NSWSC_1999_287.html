<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>By Notice of Motion filed 22 February 1999 the plaintiff
seeks to amend its Statement of Claim.  The various defendants take different
positions, and initially it is appropriate to consider the position of the
sixth to ninth defendants.
<P>

2	The proceedings concern the tendering process for what is commonly know as
the "Finger Wharf" at Woolloomooloo and some associated
works.  The plaintiff
was an unsuccessful tenderer in the project and the seventh defendant was the
successful tenderer while the
sixth, eighth and ninth defendants are joint
venturers in the project with the seventh defendant.
<P>

3	By its Summons filed on 5 January 1995 and the Amended Summons filed in Court
on 7 March 1995, the plaintiff sought inter alia
a declaration that the
decision of the first defendant on 4 March 1993 to appoint the seventh
defendant as the preferred tenderer
for the redevelopment of Woolloomooloo Bay
was void; an order in the nature of certiorari that such decision be set aside,
and an
order restraining the first defendant from implementing or otherwise
carrying into effect such decision.  The sixth to ninth defendants
were not
joined as parties in the proceedings, but they subsequently applied on their
own motion to be joined pursuant to SCR Pt
8 r 8 on the ground that they were
parties whose joinder was necessary to ensure all matters in dispute in the
proceedings be effectively
and completely determined and adjudicated upon.
<P>

4	This application by the sixth to ninth defendants was consented to by the
plaintiff and an order made by me to that effect on
11 April 1995.  At that
time I also ordered that the costs of the application for joinder, and costs
between the defendants and the
other parties be reserved to be dealt with by
the trial Judge.  The proposed Amended Statement of Claim no longer seeks the
orders
to which I have referred, but merely seeks damages against the first and
second defendants, that is to say, no order in the nature
of certiorari or for
injunction is sought nor any declaration to the effect that the decision
appointing the seventh defendant as
the preferred tenderer was void.
<P>

5	The reason why they sought to be joined was because although no relief was
expressly sought against them, if the decision to appoint
the seventh defendant
as preferred tenderer was set aside as void, the contracts for the sixth to
ninth defendants to develop the
area at Woolloomooloo Bay, which flowed from
the successful tender, would also be set aside, and in that way their contracts
were
in jeopardy.  Now that it is no longer sought to have the decision of 4
March 1993 set aside, their contracts are no longer in jeopardy
and therefore
there is no need or purpose for them to be parties to the proceedings.
Accordingly, Pt 8 r 9 applies, they have ceased
to be proper or necessary
parties and it is appropriate to order that they cease to be parties.
<P>

6	Mr Smith SC on behalf of the plaintiff does not oppose an order that they
cease to be parties, but opposes any order for costs
in their favour on the
ground that they should not have been joined in the first place, as he submits
they did not come within the
terms of Pt 8 r 8(1) and he referred me to
<b><i>Walker v The Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20496" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 496.</a>
In my view that case is distinguishable.  It involved an application by a
company liquidator to set aside payments to a creditor
of the company on the
ground that such payments were preferences, and the issue was whether persons
who had given mortgages as guarantors
of the debt should be joined.  Needham J
held they were not necessary parties as no estoppel would be created by the
proceedings
if they were joined and in any event, they could, if sued in
separate proceedings, have raised any matter including that the creditor
was
not liable for the original debt.
<P>

7	It seems to me that is a very different situation to the situation here.  As
I say, if the plaintiff was successful in having
the decision of 4 March 1993
appointing the seventh defendant as the preferred tenderer set aside, the sixth
to ninth defendants
would have lost their rights that flow from the seventh
defendant ultimately being the successful tenderer and therefore they had
a
very substantial, significant and direct interest in the outcome of the
proceedings.  If that decision of 4 March 1993 was set
aside they would have no
remedy to have the successful tender and the contracts which flowed therefrom
reinstated.  I am therefore
satisfied that they were proper parties to be
joined pursuant to Pt 8 r 8.
<P>

8	The plaintiff has a further major problem in this regard in that it consented
to their joinder, and it is arguable that having
done so it is now too late to
submit that they should never have been joined in the first place.  They having
been joined, as the
plaintiff no longer seeks any orders which will affect
their rights, I am satisfied that the plaintiff should pay the costs incurred
by the sixth to ninth defendants, but no material has been put to me which
would justify an order for costs on an indemnity basis.
<P>

9	I therefore order that the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth defendants cease
to be parties to the proceedings.  I order the plaintiff
to pay the costs of
the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth defendants of the proceedings to date,
including any reserved costs and
the costs of today.  This order may be entered
forthwith at the expiration of twenty-eight days from today.
<P>

10	I turn now to deal with the application to amend the Statement of Claim,
being the subject of the notice of motion filed on 22
February 1999 on behalf
of the plaintiff.  The proposed Amended Statement of Claim is annexed to the
Notice of Motion and the first
defendant has only two objections to it; one is
to paragraph 40.2 and the other is to paragraph 42(b).
<P>

11	In relation to paragraph 40.2 the objection is that it alleges discussions
between the plaintiff and Wedderlight-Delmo Pty Limited,
formerly the seventh
defendant, after the tendering process was complete, and this submission is
supported by reference to a letter
of particulars dated 25 March 1999, where it
is alleged that the discussions took place "after the announcement of the
result of
the tender assessment process on 22 March 1993".  
<P>

12	This is not the time nor place to determine when the tender process was
complete and when, if at all, the first defendant was
entitled to speak to the
person who was, at that stage as I understand it, "the preferred tenderer" and
who became "the successful
tenderer".  These are matters that can be resolved
at trial.
<P>

13	I therefore propose to allow paragraph 40.2, but in the light of the letter
of particulars to which I have referred, I will only
allow the amendment if
there is inserted on the second line, after the word "and", the words "after
the announcement of the result
of the tender assessment process on 22 March
1993". 
<P>

14	As to paragraph 42(b) the first defendant objects to the plaintiff splitting
the claim for damages in two and having the claim
for damages in respect of the
costs of preparing and submitting the formal tender dealt with at the main
hearing, followed by a subsequent
inquiry into damages in respect of its loss
of opportunity and loss of business reputation.
<P>

15	No evidence in relation to this latter head of damages has yet been filed,
and pursuant to an order I made on 9 June 1998 no
further evidence in chief is
to be permitted at the trial, without a special order of a Judge.
<P>

16	Counsel for the first defendant submits that all the evidence on damages
should be on before the actual trial starts, and that
there may be
disadvantages in relation to the cross-examination of the plaintiff's principal
witness if this is not so.  On the other
hand, if the first defendant is
successful in its defence of the proceedings, all this evidence which would no
doubt be costly to
gather would be irrelevant.
<P>

17	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that there will be no real prejudice
to the first defendant in permitting the claim for
damages for loss of
opportunity and business reputation to be separated from the other claims for
damages and made the subject of
a subsequent inquiry.  I will therefore permit
paragraph 42(b) in its present form.  This is not of course in any way intended
to
limit the attitude that might be taken by the trial Judge at the trial.
<P>

18	I order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the first defendant occasioned by
the amendment.
<P>

19	The second defendant who was at all relevant times the Minister with
responsibility for the first defendant, opposes the proposed
Amended Statement
of Claim on a number of grounds.
<P>

20	Firstly, he draws attention to the form, particularly of paragraph 22, and
submits that there are technical deficiencies in the
form of the pleading, and
in particular no allegation of damage.  The allegation of damage is to be found
in paragraph 25.  This
may be confusing because of the heading "proceedings" in
paragraph 23, but it is nevertheless there.
<P>

21	Paragraph 22, standing by itself, may not be the most elegant pleading of
all time but it is sufficient for the purposes.
<P>

22	Whilst conceding that the proposed amendment, if the subject of fresh
proceedings, would be statute barred at this stage, it
prima facie comes within
the terms of SCR Pt 20 r 4(5) as being a claim substituting a new cause of
action arising out of the same
or substantially the same facts as pleaded in
the earlier Statement of Claim.  Counsel for the second defendant nevertheless
submits
that I should make an order pursuant to sub-r (5A) to the effect that
the amendment not relate back to the date of the filing of
the Statement of
Claim, but date from today, and relies on the fact that no cause has been shown
for attempting to recast the claim,
nor has there been any explanation for the
delay in bringing the amendment application.
<P>

23	He referred me to the decision of the High Court in<b><i> Brisbane South
Regional Health Authority v Taylor</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 186 CLR 541</a>, particularly the
dicta of McHugh J at 556, where his Honour refers to the general presumption of
prejudice which arises from a long
delay and the rationales that have persuaded
legislatures for more than four centuries that, generally speaking, civil
actions should
be commenced within fixed periods.
<P>

24	He submits that having regard to the presumed prejudice and the lack of any
explanation for the delay in seeking the amendment
an order should be made
under sub-r (5A) which would, in effect, give the second defendant a good
limitation defence to the claim
as now amended.
<P>

25	In my view sub-r (5A) was not intended to cover a situation such as the
present.  If it were it would completely negative the
effect of sub-r (5),
which is remedial legislation designed to overcome the settled rule of practice
known as the Rule in <b><i>Weldon v Neal</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281897%29%2019%20QBD%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1897) 19 QBD 394</a>; see
<b><i>McGee v Yeomans</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NSWLR 273</a> at 284-5.  
<P>

26	It is also to be borne in mind that <b><i>Taylor's case</i> </b>was
concerned with the commencement of proceedings out of time, not with the
amendment out of time of proceedings which had already
been on foot for a
number of years, and in my view there is a substantial difference between the
two.
<P>

27	I therefore propose to allow the Amended Statement of Claim as against the
second defendant.
<P>

28	Mr Perram on behalf of the second defendant, also seeks an order that the
plaintiff pay the second defendant's costs of the proceedings
to date on the
basis that the previous claim, which was a claim for misfeasance in public
office, has been resolved in his favour.
 Although the claim for misfeasance in
public office and also claims of lack of good faith and misuse of ministerial
discretion have
been abandoned, a lot, if not all, of the costs incurred on
behalf of the second defendant to date, will be absorbed in the costs
of his
defending the proceedings as now reconstituted.
<P>

29	I therefore will not make an order for the costs of the proceedings to date,
but only the usual order that the plaintiff pay
the costs of the second
defendant of the amendment and the costs of the second defendant thrown away by
the amendment.
<P>

30	I come now to consider a claim for indemnity costs in relation to the third,
fourth and fifth defendants.  They were, at relevant
times, officers of the
first defendant, being its chief executive, a senior project manager and the
property manager.
<P>

31	In the pleadings to date serious allegations have been made against each of
these defendants; in particular, it has been alleged
that they were guilty of
misfeasance in public office, which involved an allegation that by their
conduct they had misused their
position of trust in public office. These are,
of course, very serious allegations to make against senior public servants
involved
in the disposition of public rights with large commercial
consequences.
<P>

32	In the proposed Amended Statement of Claim this allegation, and all other
allegations against them in their individual capacities
are withdrawn, and no
relief is sought against any of them. The third defendant is now deceased, but
it is agreed that that does
not affect the outcome of this application. In the
circumstances it is agreed that they should cease to be parties in the
proceedings,
but there is some dispute as to how this should be done.
<P>

33	Mr Smith SC on behalf of the plaintiff submits that he should be given leave
to discontinue the proceedings against them, and
has indicated that he would
not oppose an order that leave be granted on condition that no further
proceedings be commenced against
them in respect of these matters, except by
leave of the Court; whereas Mr Finch, counsel for the relevant defendants,
submits that
there should be an order directing the entry of judgment in their
favour, so that they are vindicated and no proceedings can in any
event be
brought against them in the future.
<P>

34	In my view they are entitled to be vindicated and they are entitled to be
placed in a position where they can assert that the
allegations against them
have, in effect, been withdrawn, that there are no outstanding allegations
against them, and that this situation
is permanent.
<P>

35	In this regard I note that there has been no evidence adduced as to why they
were joined and why these allegations were made
against them in the first
place, nor why the allegations have now been withdrawn.
<P>

36	On the other hand, Mr Smith is concerned that if judgment were entered
against them, in some way which he cannot foresee and
cannot particularise,
there may, at a later stage in the proceedings be some question of an issue of
estoppel or even res judicata
arising out of the fact that they were senior
servants of the first defendant which, being a corporation, can only act
through its
servants.
<P>

37	To guard against this possibility, remote and all as I believe it to be, I
consider the appropriate order is to grant leave to
discontinue against them,
but on condition that no proceedings be commenced against them in the future
arising out of these matters,
and that there be no qualification to that
condition permitting the leave of the Court to be obtained.
<P>

38	Arising from the discontinuance against them is the question of costs, Mr
Finch submitting that an order should be made for their
costs on an indemnity
basis. Whilst Mr Smith SC consents to an order for costs, he opposes it being
on an indemnity basis.
<P>

39	It is true that one of the grounds for ordering costs on an indemnity basis
is that a party has instituted or maintained proceedings
that have no real
prospect of success (see cases referred to at <b><u>Ritchie: Supreme Court
Procedure</u></b> (NSW) at p 1144.7), but in <b><i>Huntsman Chemical Company
Australia Limited v International Pools Australia Limited</i> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36
NSWLR 242</a> at 248, Kirby P expressed some reservation about the widening of the
circumstances in which costs should be awarded on an indemnity
basis, and
expressed the view that if a general rule of indemnity costs was adopted in
commercial litigation it could present a risk
that costs recovery entitlements
would be abused.
<P>

40	Although these proceedings have a strong administrative law flavour they
are, in substance, proceedings of a commercial nature
and it is also relevant
to bear in mind that the costs of the third, fourth and fifth defendants in the
present case, to a very large
extent, are also the costs of the first
defendant, and I have no doubt that they will be paid by the first defendant
out of its public
funds.
<P>

41	In these circumstances I consider that an order for indemnity costs is not
warranted.  I therefore grant leave to the plaintiff
to discontinue the
proceedings against the third, fourth and fifth defendants on terms that no
proceedings be subsequently instituted
by the plaintiff against such defendants
on the same causes of action, or arising out of the same or similar facts.
<P>

42	I order the plaintiff to pay the third, fourth and fifth defendants' costs
of the proceedings.
