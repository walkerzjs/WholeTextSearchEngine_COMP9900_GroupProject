<b>Judgment (On tender of documents - general compensatory damages - aggravated
damages - "<i>ratings</i>" - relevance - admissibility)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The exercise has begun of tendering, at the
close of the oral evidence in the plaintiff's case, documentary material.
<P>

2   	In each action there has been tendered without objection,
what I will describe as the usual interrogatories by a plaintiff
of a media
defendant, and its answers, as to either circulation figures or estimates of
viewing audiences.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff seeks to tender two documents described in
the schedule of the plaintiff's tender bundle for his case in chief
as
follows:
<P>

<i>"5.	Nielsen Media Research document entitled `ATN 07/05/6' (D2 Doc
115)".</i>
<P>

<i>"6.	Documents produced by AC Nielsen in answer to a subpoena for production
issued at the request of the plaintiff on or about 18
January 1999 (subpoenaed
material -envelope marked 51)".</i>
<P>

4   	The issue to which the tender of this material is said to
relate is the "<i>extent of publication" </i>by the defendant of the respective
telecasts complained of.  The "<i>extent of publication"</i>, accepted doctrine
indisputably permits, if the material is admissible, as relevant on the issue
of general compensatory damages.
<P>

5   	Its tender is not restricted to that; more importantly its
tender is as relevant to aggravated (compensatory) damages.
<P>

6   	I leave to one side any question of notice or the giving of
particulars.
<P>

7   	A plaintiff is entitled, as a general proposition, to
increased compensatory damages or "<i>aggravated damages"</i>, provided two
fundamental requirements are met:   one, it is in the end established that the
matter in aggravation affected the relevant
harm; and two, the matter, as
conduct of the defendant, can be characterised as improper, unjustifiable or
lacking in bona fides.
<P>

8   	Turning to the first essential component: relevant harm.
This material, it is said, is relevant to the increase in injury to
the
plaintiff's reputation.  It is not advanced on any basis of increase to hurt
feelings.
<P>

9   	Focusing on the basis asserted (and making the great deal
of assumptions in favour of the plaintiff as to the comprehensibility
of the
documents and what they can reasonably be understood as capable of
establishing), on no rational basis could one come to the
view that, by itself,
whatever it is it is assumed the document establishes, that it constitutes
matter that would increase the injury
in the  plaintiff's reputation, as was
pointed out in submissions for the defendant.  It would be saying no more than
a newspaper
on a particular day had a certain circulation in isolation, or it
had a circulation larger in comparison with that of its competitors
or other
publications of the same date.  Making the assumptions I have referred to, it
can go no more than establishing the extent
to which, without more, it is
certainly, relevant to the issue of general compensatory damages.
<P>

10   	Turning to the second matter, namely the attribution to
the defendant of the qualities of lacking in good faith, unjustifiability
or
impropriety, the documents in themselves, (again making every assumption as to
their comprehensibility), on no rational basis
could be understood as
establishing any one or more of those essential ingredients as against the
defendant.
<P>

11   	There is, however, the threshold problem to which I have
adverted: namely what do the documents prove?  Well their contents
are there.
On its face, each document contains columns and figures and what might be
described as legends. But, by themselves, they
do not establish anything that I
can understand.  For example in the document numbered 5 there are such
expressions as "<i>Hut Summary Report" "Dailies Plus"</i> and<i> "Preliminary
Ratings</i>".  Leaving aside my ignorance of and that there is no evidence as
to "<i>Hut Summary Report" </i>or " <i>Dailies Plus,</i>" but not ignoring my
general knowledge of the general use of the word "<i>ratings</i>",
"<i>Preliminary Ratings</i>" is meaningless.
<P>

12   	When one goes to the second page and there locates in the
columns and numbers the word "<i>Witness,</i>" there is next to it the figure
"<i>32</i>" which seems to be higher in mathematical terms to the figures next
to other words in the other columns. That may be a proportion
of something, a
score out of something; but, again, I do not know.  Similar comments must be
made in relation to the balance of document
5 insofar as it appears to deal
with other cities in this country.
<P>

13   	This is not an exercise in deliberate judicial adoption of
some opacity in relation to this matter; as I have said, the word
"<i>Ratings</i>" probably is understood generally in the community of which I
am a member.  What is not generally understood, what cannot be understood
from
its face and what certainly cannot be understood in the absence of evidence, is
a document such as number 5 which, giving it
the most favourable construction
to the plaintiff, relates to "<i>ratings"</i>, whatever they might be or mean
in the context of the heads of relevance to which it is said this material
relates.
<P>

14   	Document 6 is constituted by material produced by AC
Neilsen in answer to a subpoena.  It really confronts the Court with
the same
difficulty.  It covers a period of a year, according to the schedule to the
subpoena: 30 June 1995 to 30 June 1996.  A table,
curiously headed
"<i>Prognosis 2.00</i>", with a date 5 September 1997 thereafter, sets out
dates ranging from 9 April 1996 to 25 June 1996.  The program with which this
action is concerned is clearly identifiable.
<P>

15   	The next page, dealing with three cities in this country,
has a heading <i>"Total People</i>".  For a period of the year I have referred
to there were "<i>Tarps</i>", a "<i>%"</i> sign and projections into the
thousands.  I do not know what  "<i>Tarps</i>" is and projections, to my mind,
at the very least, are estimates pointing to the future, rather than matters
establishing historical
facts.  The incomprehensibility in the sense which I
have used that expression, attends those pages of document 6.
<P>

16   	Another part of document 6 relied upon seems to be
concerned with Port Pirie/Broken Hill, with two headings "<i>Average
Audiences</i>" and "<i>Audience Compositions</i>" one part of which deals
<i>with "hundreds of viewers</i>", divided at least into gender.  I suspect,
but cannot be certain, that under the "<i>Gender</i>" heading might be an
age-grouping.  It is said to be "<i>Survey Number 1 of 1996</i>", whatever that
means.  There are other columns in the part relied upon dealing with hundreds
of viewers headed "<i>TNS", "CLD", "G/B</i>" which I do not understand.
<P>

17   	There are thus three bases for rejecting the tender. The
first is the threshold one with which I have just dealt: namely this
Court is
incapable of coming to a rational view that permits it to understand this
document, also to understand it, for example,
in the context of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  Second, neither is rationally capable of establishing
anything other than extent of publication relevant to the issue of compensatory
damages, (making all the assumptions to which I have earlier referred). Third,
neither establishes anything as to the second ingredient
in relation to
aggravated compensatory damages, namely that which impugns the relevant conduct
of the defendant.
<P>

18   	Document 5 will be MFI 43 and Document 6 will be MFI
44.
