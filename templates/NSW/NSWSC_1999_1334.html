<P>


<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  It is necessary for me to rule upon the
tender by the defendants of a report prepared in February 1999 by Dr Margaret
Craig-Lees
of the School of Marketing at the University of New South Wales who,
for present purposes, could conveniently be described as an
expert in
marketing. She was retained, I imagine, some time in 1998 to prepare a report
which went to the question of justification.
 To that end she was provided with
certain materials by the solicitors for the defendants and she made
investigations of her own.
<P>

2  	Despite the lengthy interlocutory proceedings in this matter, it
was not until about 17 or 18 November, which was well into
this trial, that
those representing the plaintiffs became aware of the existence of this report.
This might be thought to be unfortunate,
although I make no criticism of anyone
in that regard because no application was ever made for an order that experts'
reports be
exchanged.  In any event, Dr Craig-Lees was called by the defendants
on 18 November this year to give evidence.  Shortly after she
embarked upon her
evidence objection was taken to certain aspects of the evidence.
<P>

3  	There was some debate in the absence of the jury on 18 November
and then much more detailed debate in the absence of the jury
on the morning of
19 November.  At that stage Mr Littlemore QC for the defendants stated that he
had not presently formed an intention
to tender Dr Craig-Lees' report (T911).
One of the areas of discussion was the fact that the report was based upon
material which
had not found its way into evidence.  Mr Littlemore proposed
that when the Court resumed in the presence of the jury, he would put
certain
specific assumptions to Dr Craig-Lees, consistent with the evidence, and adduce
her opinions based upon that evidence with
particular reference to a number of
the particular jobs which were executed by the plaintiff company.
<P>

4  	The evidence accordingly continued before the jury on 22
November.  There were further objections taken and certain evidence
was taken
on the voir dire.  In any event, Dr Craig-Lees' evidence was taken to the
conclusion of her examination-in-chief and she
was then cross-examined at some
length, but I would not have thought undue length by Mr Hughes QC on behalf of
the plaintiffs.
<P>

5  	One of the matters that he put to Dr Craig-Lees was the
submission that the assumptions upon which she relied, in one very significant
aspect, did not include certain material  which was to be found in her report.
In other words, in expressing certain views, she was
not taking into account
basically the assumptions, but certain material which was not specifically in
evidence but which she had
taken into account in her report.  To the extent
that it is necessary for me to express an opinion on that, I would have thought
that that was a permissible course of cross-examination, without it being said
that counsel for the plaintiffs had embarked upon
a cross-examination of the
witness in relation to her report to the extent necessary to attract a
conclusion that there had been
cross-examination on the report, in the sense
which is generally relied upon to attract either the tender by the other party
of a
report, or the other party requiring the cross-examining party to put a
report in evidence.
<P>

6  	However, the cross-examination constituted, as one would
anticipate, a somewhat determined attack upon Dr Craig-Lees' credibility
and
her expertise and the validity of a number of her significant conclusions.  The
attack, if I may use that expression without
sounding offensive, was directed
in many instances to specific extracts from the report.  In some instances
extracts were read to
the witness from the report.  She was cross-examined
about material in certain respects upon which she relied in expressing her
opinions
in the report.  Apart from numerous direct references to her report,
there were a number of questions which implicitly referred to
the content of
the report, together with information which the witness did or did not have
prior to compiling the report.
<P>

7  	I think it may fairly be said, in summary, that the
cross-examination ranged widely over the report.  I have concluded that,
in the
generally understood way in which this phrase is understood, the witness was
cross-examined on her report.  I cannot respectfully
agree that the
cross-examination could fairly be described as restricted to a relatively small
number of discrete areas so far as
the report was concerned.
<P>

8  	In re-examination by Mr Littlemore there was a brief reference to
the report.  No application was made by counsel for the defendants,
prior to
the witness being excused, for the report to be admitted into evidence.
However, it should be noted that during one of the
numerous debates arising out
of objections to certain parts of the cross-examination, Mr Littlemore said (at
transcript 1000 on 23
November):
<P>

"It now transpires that without any question whatsoever our learned friend Mr
Hughes has cross-examined that report into evidence,
and it shall be tendered.
So the case is altered.  Whereas at the time I took that objection we had no
intention of relying on that
report, the fact is now that my friend has
cross-examined it into evidence.  So we shall have, upon the tender and the
receipt into
evidence of the report, two bodies of evidence from Dr Craig-Lees;
that which we offered in chief, which is offered on the basis
of her assuming
certain evidence had been given and which has gone into evidence, and we shall
also be able to, we respectfully submit,
rely on the report, albeit a report
that was under attack last week which my learned friend has now chosen to
cross-examine into
evidence."
<P>

9  	This statement attracted no response from Mr Hughes, although I
would not be prepared to say that a lack of response could be
interpreted as an
assent to that proposition.  Nevertheless, the plaintiffs were put on notice by
Mr Littlemore that he would be
seeking to tender the report.  However, that did
not happen until the end of the whole of the oral evidence tendered by the
defendants.
 During the course of tendering a number of documents Mr Littlemore
tendered the report, and objection has been taken to it.  I have
heard detailed
argument on that and reference has been made to a number of the authorities.
<P>

10  	One question which particularly arises is whether, allowing for
the wide-ranging cross-examination on the report, it is now
too late for it to
be tendered.
<P>

11  	Reference was made to the judgment of Harris J in
<u>Hatziparadissis v GFC (Manufacturing) Pty Limited</u>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1978/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] VicRp 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20VR%20181" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) VR 181.</a>  That
case is authority for the proposition, certainly in Victoria, that:
<P>

"The right of the party calling the witness to require the cross-examiner of a
witness to tender in evidence a document used by
the witness to refresh his
memory (where cross-examination upon it has extended beyond matters referred to
by the witness to refresh
his memory) is available only during the course of
the cross-examination."
<P>

At page 184 his Honour said:
<P>

"There is a further point which, in my opinion supports the conclusion, and it
is one which was relied upon by Mr Meldrum.  If the
rule is invoked at that
point of time, the situation is that the witness is still under
cross-examination.  Although the cross-examiner
has been forced to put the
document in, it does not mean that he is thereafter debarred from asking
further questions about it. He
is then in a position to continue to
cross-examine about it with a view to explaining the additional parts in it, or
reducing the
impact of them or dealing with them in some way which he considers
to be appropriate.  True enough, if the document were allowed
in at a later
stage, the witness could be recalled, but I consider if I allowed that course
to be adopted, I would be going beyond
the contents of the rule as it is to be
found in the authorities and textbooks so far.  I do not consider I would be
justified in
taking that step."
<P>

12  	It is interesting to note that in a paper presented by Mr M H
McHugh QC, as his Honour then was, dealing with cross-examination
on documents,
which is to be found in Volume 1 of the Australian Bar Review 1985, page 51, at
page 60, Mr McHugh said:
<P>

"A very important decision by Harris J in the Victorian Supreme Court, which is
contrary to the practice which has existed in my
time at the New South Wales
Bar, is authority for this proposition."
<P>

13  	Mr McHugh then referred to<b> </b><u>Hatziparadissis</u>, and
continued:
<P>

"Very frequently counsel in New South Wales will say of his opponent, `He
examined on that document; he has got to tender it'. 
It might be two days
later, or a month later or it might be in re-examination of the witness.  But
Harris J deals with the matter
in some detail and he decides as a matter of
precise decision that if you do not require the tender of the document during
cross-examination
you lose your right to insist on the tender."
<P>

14  	Counsel have not drawn my attention to any authority in New
South Wales which approves of the approach taken by Harris J in<b>
</b><u>Hatziparadissis</u>.  It was the subject of consideration by the
Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal (Andrews CJ, Thomas J; de Jersey J) in<b>
</b><u>R v Foggo ex parte Attorney-General</u>.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%202%20QdR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 2 QdR 49.</a>  Their Honours
did not accept that the principle enunciated by Harris J was an inflexible one
and indeed referred to the fact that
in<b> </b><u>R v McGregor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20QdR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 QdR
256</a> at 265. McPherson J expressed reservations about the decision in
<u>Hatziparadissis</u>.  And indeed in<b> </b><u>Foggo</u> their Honours did
not disturb a ruling by the trial judge that it was open to the Crown to
tender, at any stage, a document which
had been cross-examined on by counsel
for the accused.  It is only fair to say, however, that there was a very
particular reason
why in that case the Crown Prosecutor deferred the tender of
the document.  It was necessary for the document to be dealt with by
another
Crown witness who gave evidence after the cross-examination on the document had
taken place.
<P>

15  	So it seems to me, interesting, and in some respects persuasive,
as the decision in<b> </b><u>Hatziparadissis</u> is, it cannot be treated in
this State certainly as a principle which would have required the tender of the
subject report prior
to the conclusion of Dr Craig-Lees' evidence.  I would
have thought that it would have been preferable if the matter had been dealt
with while Dr Craig-Lees was still giving evidence, but that cannot be
considered to be a fatal objection, and there can be no doubt
that while she
was in the witness box, the plaintiffs were informed of the defendants'
intention to tender the report.
<P>

16  	A question also must arise as to whether the cross-examination
of Dr Craig-Lees has attracted the admissibility of the whole
document or only
part thereof. <b> </b><u>Meredith v Innes</u> (1930) 31 SR 104. is authority
for the proposition that if some part only of the statement is cross-examined
upon, only that part
and such other parts as are so connected with that part as
are necessary to explain it, are admissible.
<P>

17  	I have carefully overnight re-read the cross-examination of Dr
Craig-Lees, with particular reference to the report, and endeavoured
to relate
the cross-examination (so far as time permitted) to the terms of the report
itself, to satisfy myself whether any part
or parts of the report could
satisfactorily be severed off, by reason of the content of the relevant
cross-examination being neither
a direct nor implied reference to any part of
the report.  I am unable to satisfy myself that such a severance is possible.
In my
view the whole report should go in.  I have, of course, given anxious
consideration to the question of fairness to the plaintiffs,
but in the context
of the case as a whole, the entirety of the evidence, and the events which have
happened, I am not satisfied that
admitting the whole report at this stage
would be unfairly prejudicial in the legal sense, to the plaintiffs, and so I
propose to
admit the whole report.  That can be done when the jury returns.
