<center><u>DIMITRI GRINEFF  v   ALEXANDER CHUSOV &amp; ORS</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter the plaintiff is Dimitri
Grineff.  He was a nephew of Fotinia Nicolaeff and her brother, Michael
Nicolaeff.  His mother, Vera Grineff, was the sister of Fotinia and Michael.
The first defendant, Alexander Chusov, is the son of
Klavdia Nicolaeff, who was
the wife of Michael Nicolaeff.  The second defendant, the Public Trustee, is
the executor of Klavdia's
estate.  Fotinia, Michael and Klavdia Nicolaeff are
deceased.  
<P>

2   	There is no appearance on behalf of Alexander Chusov.  He
was, at one time, represented by a firm of solicitors in Sydney and
an
appearance was entered.  The solicitor, after taking proper steps, filed a
Notice of Ceasing to Act.  More recently, a solicitor
in Victoria has indicated
that he had been contacted on behalf of Mr Chusov and had been in touch with
his solicitors in Russia;
but in the event there is now no appearance for him.
The Public Trustee has put in a submitting appearance.
<P>

3   	The matter principally in issue concerns the ownership of a
home at 14 Wray Street, Fairfield, which was the residence of Fotinia
and
Michael and later Klavdia.  There is also another issue as to funds which were
drawn from Fotinia's bank accounts about the time
she went into a nursing
home.
<P>

4   	I shall set out the principal facts briefly.  Fotinia was
born on 2 December 1916 in Russia.  In 1922, she and her parents
moved to China
and her younger brother Michael was born in that country.  In 1960, Fotinia,
Michael and their parents migrated to
Australia.  In April 1964, Fotinia and
Michael purchased the subject property in Fairfield as joint tenants for a
price of &#163;5,670.
 A mortgage from the Commonwealth Bank for &#163;3,700
was taken out.  It seems as though Fotinia and Michael contributed the
necessary
funds equally from their own savings.
<P>

5   	In the following year, Fotinia sponsored the migration to
Australia of her sister Vera, her husband and their son Dimitri Grineff,
the
plaintiff. After arriving in Australia, they lived until 1968 in the garage of
the Fairfield property. 
<P>

6   	By 1967 Michael was showing signs of the delusional
condition which was later diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia.  I need
not go
into all the details; but it is clear that he imagined that he was being
affected by burning ray equipment and that he was
at risk from secret services,
including Australian secret services. 
<P>

7   	In mid to late 1968, Michael was so concerned about what he
considered to be the threats to his safety that he decided to move
to Russia.
He said to the plaintiff: 
<P>

<i>"I am emigrating for good.  I am not returning to the country where they are
trying to kill me.  I do not want to become a citizen
of Australia, the country
whose secret service want to kill me.  I want to start a new life as a Soviet
citizen."</i>
<P>

With this background he spoke to Fotinia and sought from her funds to enable
him to obtain accommodation in Russia.  An oral arrangement
of some sort was
made between them and it is known that Fotinia paid to Michael sums totalling
approximately $2000, which was about
one-half of the moneys which they had put
into the property, and that subsequently she sent some other moneys overseas to
Michael
whilst he was in Russia.  However, the exact nature of the arrangement
between them is not known.  According to the plaintiff, Fotinia
said words to
him to the effect, "I have paid Michael his share," and, before he left,
Michael said, "I have got my share of the
house."  Nevertheless, the house was
not transferred into Fotinia's name notwithstanding that, at that time, a firm
of solicitors,
D C McLaren &amp; Co, was engaged to draw up a loan agreement
which Fotinia signed in relation to a sum which she had borrowed from
a friend
to enable her to make the payment to Michael. 
<P>

8   	The plaintiff's evidence is that, some years later, in
1982, Fotinia said:
<P>

"<i>He (Michael) persuaded me to leave the house registered in both names as
insurance that in the event of my death the house would not
be lost.  Also as
insurance to receive the rest of his money from me.</i>"
<P>

In any event, when Michael went overseas in early 1969 the property remained in
the joint names.  Fotinia continued to make payments
under the mortgage until
it was finally discharged in April 1976.  
<P>

9   	In 1980, Michael indicated that he proposed to return to
Australia and that he wished to bring to Australia his then girlfriend,
Klavdia.  Fotinia was not at first pleased with this information and wrote to
Michael saying, inter alia:
<P>

"<i>I understand that for you it is one thing to come for three months but
another to come forever and you will ruin my health for all
that time.  You
have to live on something and I don't want to ask my tenants to leave and it
will be crowded for us in the garage.</i>"
<P>

Apparently the house at Fairfield was, at that stage, let to tenants and
Fotinia herself was living in the garage.
<P>

10   	However, Michael and Klavdia did arrive in Australia in
September 1981 and they moved into the Fairfield property.  Klavdia
was
younger, I think, than both Fotinia and Michael, certainly younger than
Fotinia.  Klavdia appears to have been a person who abused
alcohol and she was
a person with a considerable temper and an inclination to violence when she had
been drinking.  By early 1982,
Klavdia had abused and struck Fotinia more than
once and in early 1982 she formed the view that she ought to have an interest
in
the Fairfield property and that she should be entitled to half of Michael's
one-half share in the house.  On 3 June 1982 a caveat
was lodged by Klavdia
over the Fairfield property claiming a resulting trust of a one-quarter share.

<P>

11   	On 23 August 1982, Fotinia executed a will leaving her
estate to Michael for life and, on his death, to the plaintiff.  
<P>

12   	At the end of 1982 and into early 1983, Michael was
treated at hospitals and health centres because of his paranoid schizophrenia.
In 1982/83 there were more abuse and assaults of Fotinia and, on 25 August
1983, a summons was issued against Klavdia alleging an
assault of Fotinia on 21
August 1983.  That matter was ultimately settled a year later on Klavdia's
undertaking not to verbally or
physically assault Fotinia.
<P>

13   	In the meantime, there was a transaction in relation to
the Fairfield property which is one of those with which these proceedings
are
concerned.  Fotinia and Michael, as joint tenants, transferred the Fairfield
property to themselves as tenants in common in equal
shares for a stated
consideration of $1.  On the same day, Michael, for an expressed consideration
of $14,500, transferred half of
his share of the property to Klavdia. An
agreement for the sale between Michael and Klavdia and the two necessary
transfers were
prepared by D C McLaren &amp; Co who had acted in 1968 when
Fotinia had borrowed money to pay to Michael.  
<P>

14   	During 1984 and 1986, there were further visits by Michael
to the Fairfield Area Health Centre and Rydalmere Hospital. In
1984 and 1986,
there were further abuses of Fotinia by Klavdia and assaults on her by Klavdia.

<P>

15   	In 1986, two summons were issued by Fotinia against
Klavdia.  In July 1987, Fotinia left her Westpac passbook accounts with
her
sister Vera and asked her to look after it.  In December 1988, Klavdia alleged
that she had been assaulted by Michael and Michael
was charged.  The statement
given to the police also alleged that Fotinia had taken a necklace from
Klavdia's neck and grabbed her
right hand and bitten it.  The complaint
included the statement: "My husband likes his sister better than me, listens to
her not
me."  It is clear from the overall evidence that there was a very close
relationship between Michael and Fotinia.
<P>

16   	Subsequently the charge brought by Klavdia was withdrawn.
At the end of 1989 Fotinia was becoming physically weak and incontinent.
 She
was, therefore, unable herself to travel to see her sister Vera and,
thereafter, the plaintiff would, from time to time, drive
her to his mother's
home. On one visit towards the end of 1989, Fotinia said words to the effect,
"Michael looks after me because
I am becoming more and more frail".
<P>

17   	The plaintiff has given evidence that there were occasions
when his mother and he attempted to visit Fotinia but Klavdia discouraged
the
visits saying words to the effect that Fotinia was not at home. At the end of
1989 on one visit Fotinia asked for her Westpac
passbook and that was given to
her.  She did not explain why she wished it.  
<P>

18   	On 1 May 1990, Michael was admitted to Liverpool Hospital
because of his delusional state and he remained there until 5 June
1990.
Earlier, Klavdia had applied for a domiciliary nursing benefit for Fotinia and,
in the application form, described her condition
as including senile dementia
and incontinence of the urinary bladder.  
<P>

19   	On 20 July 1990, Fotinia was admitted to Liverpool
Hospital.  The records of the hospital show that she was diagnosed as having
dementia.  A report of Dr N M Munn of 17 August 1990 mentions a diagnosis of
dementia, mild diabetes and mild hypertension. Dr Munn
stated that her
condition since discharge from Liverpool Hospital was:
<P>

<i>"She has now settled in a Nursing Home, the Nurse who accompanied her agreed
she gets confused and lost and she is still unable to
talk for herself
spontaneously, there doesn't appear to be any major problems."</i>
<P>

A cerebral CT scan was normal. Dr Munn concluded:
<P>

<i>"Probable diagnosis here is hypertension, cerebral vascular ischaemic,
dementia; although you can't exclude Alzheimers; either way
neither of these
amenable to treatment."</i>
<P>

20   	On 31 July, Fotinia was transferred from the Liverpool
Hospital into St Sergius Nursing Home and was there given a principal
diagnosis
of dementia with diabetes present.  Doctor S K Law subsequently reported on 11
August 1995, at a time when Vera was seeking
to take control of her sister's
affairs:
<P>

<i>"On the physical side she is obese, virtually chair fast, though able to
shuffle walk with help. She is able to eat and drink unaided.
Her diabetes is
well controlled, though she has urinary incontinence and in all probability has
been like this since her admission
in July 1990."</i>
<P>

21   	On 1 August 1990, solicitors, Calvin Nelson &amp; Co., who
had acted for Klavdia in at least one of the assault proceedings,
wrote to
Michael and Klavdia to say: 
<P>

<i>"We confirm your instructions that Fotinia Nicolaeff will, without the
payment of any monies, transfer her one half interest in the
property 14 Wray
Street, Fairfield to you."</i>
<P>

22   	In March 1991, a transfer from Fotinia to Michael and
Klavdia of her one-half share in the Fairfield property was executed.
The
transfer was expressed to be in consideration of a payment of $70,000.  No such
payment was made.  The transfer was signed twice
by Fotinia.  The first
signature was apparently so shaky that the solicitors, Calvin Nelson &amp; Co
considered that a further signature
was required.  
<P>

23   	On this occasion Mr Michael Trotiansky, who was an
accounts clerk at St Sergius Nursing Home, was called to assist.  He knew
Fotinia and has given evidence he would, on occasions, say to her in Russian
words, "How are you today Miss Nicolaeff?" and she would
reply in Russian
words, "I am well," or "I am not so well."  On being informed by Klavdia and
Michael there was a problem with the
signature, Mr Trotiansky phoned Calvin
Nelson &amp; Co and obtained instructions as to what should be done.  His
affidavit evidence
states:
<P>

<i>"I then went with Klavdia and Michael Nicolaeff to Fotinia Nicolaeff's room.
Klavdia Nicolaeff held the transfer in her hand.  Fotinia
Nicolaeff was sitting
in her armchair.  She did not get up when we entered the room.  I do not
remember the exact chain of events
but I do remember that Klavdia and Michael
Nicolaeff kissed Fotinia Nicolaeff and said hello to her (in Russian).  Fotinia
Nicolaeff
was then given the transfer to sign.  I also remember that someone
pushed the mobile table to her so that she would have something
to lean on
while she signed. I also remember that she seemed to take a long time to sign
the document as she was very careful in
writing the letters.  I then signed as
her witness and filled in my name and address.  I then left the room.  Klavdia
and Michael
Nicolaeff stayed behind and I left the transfer with them.</i>
<P>

<i>As Fotinia Nicolaeff signed the transfer, I did not ask her what she was
signing.  I did not go through the document with her nor
did I explain the
document to her.  As far as I can remember Fotinia Nicolaeff did not ask
Klavdia or Michael Nicolaeff what the
document was (and neither of them went
through the document with her nor explained the document to her while I was
present.)"</i>
<P>

It will be seen from this that on the occasion of the second signing, after Mr
Trostiansky had spoken to Calvin Nelson &amp; Co.,
there was no information
given to Fotinia as to what the nature of the document to be executed was, or
why it had to be signed. 
Simply, a document was put in front of her for
signature and she signed it, exercising care. 
<P>

24   	The plaintiff says that he and his mother visited Fotinia
at the nursing home around about this time and nothing was said
to them about a
transfer of the property.  He says, moreover, that at this time Fotinia had
difficulty remembering anything she had
done just a short time before.  Fotinia
remained in the nursing home.  
<P>

25   	Following upon this transaction is a note dated 1993 from
Klavdia's papers which records that Vera and her family were angry
about the
house and goes on to say:
<P>

<i> "It is not enough for them that I [Klavdia] transferred all the documents
into my name ...I redid everything or it would all have
vanished into the
air."</i>
<P>

The substance of this appears to be that had the two transactions I have
mentioned not occurred, Klavdia would not have obtained
any interest in the
home. 
<P>

26   	Michael died on 26 February 1993.  Klavdia died from acute
alcohol poisoning on 30 September 1994 and Fotinia died on 3 July
1996.
Fotinia left practically no assets and Klavdia's assets listed by the Public
Trustee are the property at 14 Wray Street, Fairfield,
some money,
approximately $6000, in a Commonwealth Bank account, and some minor moneys owed
to her.  
<P>

27   	Those are the relevant facts with respect to the land. I
have yet to come to the facts with respect to the bank account. 
I shall deal
with them later. 
<P>

28   	Of the principles relied upon, the first is that of <i>non
est factum</i>, that is that a person who does an act without understanding the
nature of what occurs is not bound by that act.  The principle is
stated this
way by Fullagar J in <i>Blomley v Ryan</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 362</a> at 401:
<P>

"<i>The case is not one of that comparatively rare cases where a man's
faculties, whether from age or natural infirmity or drink or any
other cause,
are so defective that he does not really know what he is doing - that his mind
does not go with his deed. In such a
case his instrument is void even at law -
non est factum.</i>"
<P>

Also relied upon are elements of the principle of equitable fraud.  These
principles were stated in <i>Story's Equity Jurisprudence</i>, 13th edition in
par 187 as follows:
<P>

<i>"Fraud indeed, in the sense of a Court of Equity, properly includes all
acts, omissions and concealments which involve a breach of
legal or equitable
duty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious to another, or by
which an undue and unconscientious
advantage is taken of another."</i>
<P>

Paragraph 221 of Story states, when dealing with relevant cases of fraud:
<P>

<i>"In this class might properly be included all cases of unconscientious
advantages in bargains obtained by imposition, circumvention,
surprise, and
undue influence over persons in general, and in an especial manner all
unconscientious advantages, or bargains obtained
over persons disabled by
weakness, infirmity, age, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness, coverture, or other
incapacity, from taking due care
of or protecting their own rights and
interests."</i>
<P>

29   	This general principle has been adopted in the United
Kingdom in cases such as <i>Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20AC%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] AC 691</a>,
<i>Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1974/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] EWCA Civ 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20QB%20326" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 QB 326</a> and <i>National Westminster Bank
PLC v Morgan</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1985/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20AC%20686" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] AC 686</a> and in this country in <i>Blomley v Ryan</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 362</a>, <i>Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151
CLR 447</a> and <i>Legione v Hateley</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20152%20CLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 152 CLR 406.</a>
<P>

30   	Under this general principle, there are three specific
principles with which we are concerned.  Firstly, the principle of
duress which
is, I think, for present purposes, sufficiently expressed in <i>Barton v
Armstrong</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20AC%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) AC 104</a> at 121 where Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon in
their dissenting opinion stated:
<P>

<i>"This involves consideration of what the law regards as voluntary, or its
opposites; for in life, including the life of commerce and
finance, many acts
are done under pressure, sometimes overwhelming pressure, so that one can say
that the actor had no choice but
to act.  Absence of choice in this sense does
not negate consent in law: for this the pressure must be one of a kind which
the law
does not regard as legitimate.  Thus, out of the various means by which
consent may be obtained - advice, persuasion, influence,
inducement,
representation, commercial pressure - the law has come to select some which it
will not accept as a reason for voluntary
action: fraud, abuse of relation of
confidence, undue influence, duress or coercion. In this the law, under the
influence of equity,
has developed from the old common law conception of duress
- threat to life and limb - and it has arrived at the modern generalisation
expressed by Holmes J - 'subjected to an improper motive or action': Fairbanks
v Snow 13 N.E. Reporter 596, 598.</i>
<P>

<i>In an action such as the present, then, the first step required of the
plaintiff is to show that some illegitimate means of persuasion
was
used."</i>
<P>

31   	That principle has been applied in cases such as <i>Pao
On</i><b> </b><i>v Lau Yiu Long</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1979/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] UKPC 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 614</a>, <i>Crescendo Management Pty

McHugh JA, with whom Samuels and Mahoney JJA agreed, in <i>Crescendo
Management</i> when his Honour said at page 46:
<P>

"<i>The proper approach in my opinion is to ask whether any applied pressure
induced the victim to enter into the contract and then ask
whether that
pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to countenance as legitimate?
Pressure will be illegitimate if it consists
of unlawful threats or amounts to
unconscionable conduct,. But the categories are not closed. Even overwhelming
pressure, not amounting
to unconscionable or unlawful conduct, however, will
not necessarily constitute economic duress.</i>"
<P>

32   	Another two aspects of the principle of equitable fraud
are undue influence and unconscionable conduct. For present purposes
I think it
is sufficient to refer to<b> </b><i>Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v
Amadio at </i> 461 where Mason J said:
<P>

<i>"Historically, courts have exercised jurisdiction to set aside contracts and
other dealings on a variety of equitable grounds.  They
include fraud,
misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, undue influence and unconscionable
conduct.  In one sense they all constitute
species of unconscionable conduct on
the part of a party who stands to receive a benefit under a transactions which,
in the eye of
equity, cannot be enforced because to do so would be inconsistent
with equity and good conscience.  But relief on the ground of 'unconscionable
conduct' is usually taken to refer to the class of case in which a party makes
unconscientious use of his superior position or bargaining
power to the
detriment of a party who suffers from some special disability or is placed in
some special situation of disadvantage,
e.g. a catching bargain with an
expectant heir or an unfair contract made by taking advantage of a person who
is seriously affected
by intoxicating drink.  Although unconscionable conduct
in this narrow sense bears some resemblance to the doctrine of undue influence,
there is a difference between the two.  In the latter the will of the innocent
party is not independent and voluntary because it
is overborne.  In the former
the will of the innocent party, even if independent and voluntary, is the
result of the disadvantageous
position in which he is placed and of the other
party unconsciously taking advantage of that position.</i>
<P>

<i>There is no reason for thinking that the two remedies are mutually exclusive
in the sense that only one of them is available in a
particular situation to
the exclusion of the other.  Relief on the ground of unconscionable conduct
will be granted when unconscientious
advantage is taken of an innocent party
whose will is overborne so that it is not independent and voluntary, just as it
will be granted
when such advantage is taken of an innocent party who, though
not deprived of an independent and voluntary will, is unable to make
a
worthwhile judgment as to what is in his best interest."</i>
<P>

Other more detailed aspects of the principle of unconscionable conduct are
dealt with in the reasons of his Honour, particularly
at p 462.  I need do no
more than refer to his Honour's remarks. 
<P>

33   	The first submission of counsel for the plaintiff, Ms
Ottesen, was that, when Fotinia paid Michael the $2000 in 1969 and when
she
sent to Michael further sums thereafter, she undertook all that she had to do
pursuant to an arrangement whereby, for that price,
she acquired the whole of
the interest in the Fairfield property.  I have outlined the basic facts in
relation to that matter and
I can see why the submission is made, for there is
a good deal of substance in it.  
<P>

34   	However, there are two reasons why I think the submission
should be rejected.  The first is that there is great doubt as to
what was
agreed between the parties and a doubt as to whether Michael was at that stage
in a fit state to come to any final arrangement
with respect to the Fairfield
property.  We know he was under pressure form his delusions to leave the
country and needed money to
acquire accommodation in Russia.  We also know from
Fotinia's statement to the plaintiff and to Vera that Michael had persuaded
Fotinia
to leave the house registered in both names.  That suggests that
Michael was, although he was going to Russia, still hoping or expecting
to have
some remaining interest in the property. In fact, nothing was done about
transferring the title although, as I have said,
Fotinia went to her solicitors
to have a loan agreement drawn up. 
<P>

35   	I am not satisfied on the facts that there was ever a
final binding agreement between Fotinia and Michael for transfer of
property to
Fotinia and, in particular, I consider that, had the matter been finally agreed
between them at that time, a transfer
would have been formally executed.  I
think the more likely position is that Michael did not anticipate participating
any further
in the property, at least until after Fotinia's death, but he was
not actually prepared to sign a transfer at that time.  
<P>

36   	Another aspect of the matter is that the relationship
between Fotinia and Michael was close.  I have already referred to one
statement by Klavdia that Michael preferred Fotinia to her.  That is not the
only such statement. The whole history of the association
between Fotinia and
her brother Michael shows that that was the case.  It follows, in my opinion,
that once Michael had arrived in
Australia with his wife, Fotinia would have
wished them to live with her and, in my opinion, once they were living with
her, Fotinia
would have been very happy for Michael to have a half interest in
the property.  She would have considered that to be proper. So,
it seems to me
that Fotinia would have agreed to the transfer into tenancy in common and would
have been happy for that to be the
position having regard to the fact that
Michael had returned from Russia and was married. It seems to me that that
transaction having
been carried out, that was how Fotinia wanted affairs to be.
Moreover, if Fotinia had complained about the transaction in her lifetime,
I
think she would have been estopped from raising that point because the matter
had been done and the other parties had relied upon
it.   So, for those
reasons, I cannot accept the submission that Fotinia was the sole beneficial
owner of the property at Fairfield.
<P>

37   	That brings me, then, to the question whether Fotinia
executed the transfer in the names of herself and her brother as tenants
in
common under duress or undue influence, or whether the transaction was
unconscionable.  On the whole it seems to me that Fotinia
would have executed
the transfer of her own free will, knowing what she was doing and that she did
it happily with a view to making
Michael's marriage a happier one.   I can see
the argument for duress.  Fotinia had been the subject of abuse and some
physical assaults,
but it does not seem to me that what had occurred was
directed expressly at the point of the land or that she would have executed
a
transfer because of those threats.  I think she is more likely to have executed
the transfer because she felt that Klavdia was
unhappy, one of the reasons for
the unhappiness being that Klavdia was worried she might have no security in
the future should Michael
die. It seems to me that Fotinia would have executed
the transfer with a view to putting the family on a better footing rather than
because of duress or because of any influence that was exercised and it seems
to me to be that the transaction that occurred was
not unconscionable. That is
because Klavdia had come out to Australia with Michael, her security was at
risk, and Michael was not
a tower of strength for the very reason that he
suffered from delusions. 
<P>

38   	In the papers, there are complaints made by Fotinia about
assault.   Some of the complaints are written statements.  In them,
there is no
complaint that the property was taken out of her name because of duress or
wrongful influence or unconscionable conduct.
 The only statement that comes
possibly to such a complaint is one in the affidavit of Vera who said that her
sister, in July 1982,
said to her words to the effect:
<P>

<i> "Now that he and Klavdia have returned, I appear not to have a moment's
peace.  Klavdia wants to drive me out of my house.  It is
my house and I should
not be treated in this way."</i>
<P>

It seems to me that the reference to "my house" is too general to amount to
persuasive evidence that the property was hers in its
entirety or, for that
matter, to be a complaint about duress.  It seems to me it was more a complaint
about Klavdia's behaviour.
 So, for those reasons, I do not accept the
submission that the transfer of the property into the names of Fotinia and
Michael as
tenants in common and the transfer by Michael to Klavdia of a
one-quarter share of the property should be set aside.
<P>

39   	The next aspect is somewhat easier.  That is the transfer
which was executed in April 1991.  It seems that what was done on
that occasion
would be set aside under any of the principles of non est factum, undue
influence and unconscionable conduct.
<P>

40   	Fotinia was at the time incapable of looking after her
affairs and was suffering from quite severe senile dementia.  She received
nothing in the transfer, although it was expressed to be a transfer in
consideration of the payment of $70,000.  She did not receive
independent legal
advice.  Her solicitors, D C McLaren &amp; Co., were not used and there was no
evidence that she received independent
advice, or indeed any advice from any
person. 
<P>

41   	I am satisfied that Fotinia was at the time so deficient
in mind that it is probable that she executed the document not knowing
that it
was.  If I am wrong in that, I am satisfied that the unconscionable nature of
the transaction, taking as it did the only
substantial asset which she had and
giving nothing in return, was unconscionable and was only executed because of
the influence which
Michael and Klavdia had over her.  She had in fact been
reliant on them for quite some time before she was put into hospital and
then
into the nursing home.  For those reasons, I am satisfied that the orders
sought in relation to that transaction of April 1991
should be granted.
<P>

42   	That leaves the question of the moneys.  I have already
mentioned that, as at 3 April 1990, Klavdia had applied for domiciliary
nursing
benefit on the grounds that Fotinia was suffering from senile dementia.  I have
also mentioned that, on 1 May 1990, Michael
was admitted to Liverpool Hospital
because of his delusions and that he remained there until 5 June 1990.
<P>

43   	In early May 1990, Fotinia had a Commonwealth Savings Bank
account which had a little over $5000 to its credit.  On 8 May
1990 a sum of
$1250 was withdrawn.  The withdrawal form was signed by Fotinia and on the
reverse side by Klavdia. A further sum of
$1000 withdrawn from the account on
16 July 1990.  Evidence has been given by a handwriting expert, Mr P D
Westwood, Forensic Document
Services Pty Limited, that the withdrawal slip was
very probably not written by Fotinia and was probably written by Klavdia.  This
was just four days before Fotinia was admitted to Liverpool Hospital, the
admission records of which noted: "<i>Family claims she is crazy, refuse to
have her at home any longer</i>."
<P>

44   	Two days later the account had been reduced to $2638.18.
On 31 July 1990, the day on which Fotinia was transferred to St Sergius
Nursing
Home, a withdrawal slip signed by Fotinia was presented for the sum of $2638.
That left the account with a credit of eighteen
cents before the next Social
Security pension cheque was paid in.  
<P>

45   	Those sums all have the suspicious element of being either
round sums or sums close to the total of the account.  There was
no explanation
for their withdrawal which is known.  I think it is probable that the sums were
withdrawn by the actions of Klavdia
with a view to clearing out the moneys in
Fotinia's account.  Once again, I conclude that, although two of the withdrawal
slips were
signed by Fotinia, she was then incapable of understanding the
nature of the act which she was doing, that she acted under Klavdia's
instructions and that the money went to Klavdia's benefit and not to the
benefit of Fotinia.   The amount of $2638 was in fact deposited
to an account
in Klavdia's name on the same day.  
<P>

46   	Like comments can be made about other withdrawals. A sum
of $1600 was withdrawn from Fotinia's Westpac savings account which,
on 30
April 1990, had a credit of $2448.03.  On 3 July 1990, a withdrawal slip signed
by Fotinia was used to withdraw $1600 from
this account.   Fotinia had a third
Westpac savings account to which a little over $7000 was credited on 16 May
1991 on the termination
of a term deposit.  On the same day, $5000 was
withdrawn and shortly thereafter there was a further amount of $2130 withdrawn.
Mr
Westwood's evidence is that the withdrawal form for the latter was probably
written by Klavdia.  That left the account with only
a little over $20 to its
credit.  
<P>

47   	I am satisfied that all these moneys were taken by Klavdia
for improper purposes and that they were not withdrawn as a result
of the
exercise of individual will by Fotinia.
<P>

48   	I will order that the plaintiff's costs be taxed and paid
out of the estate and that the Public Trustee's costs be paid out
of the
estate.
<P>

49   	I direct that counsel bring in short minutes by 5pm on
Friday.
