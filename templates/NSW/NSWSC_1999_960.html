<b><u>11274/.99 - Andrew DONNELLY &amp; David MUNDINE  v  ROSS MINING
NL</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Before the Court are the following
applications:
<P>

1.	An application by way of Summons filed on 26 May 1999.
<P>

2.	A Notice of Motion filed on 5 August 1999.
<P>

3.	A Notice of Motion filed on 19 August 1999.
<P>

4.	An Amended Summons filed on 13 September 1999.
<P>

2  	In the Summons filed on 26 May 1999 Mr. Andrew Donnelly and Mr.
David Mundine, (to whom I shall refer for the sake of convenience
as <i>"the
appellants"</i>), seek against Ross Mining NL, (to which entity I shall refer
for the sake of convenience as <i>"the respondent"</i>), relief expressed as
follows:
<P>

"1.	A declaration that the solicitors for the Appellants for the purposes of
the Costs assessment had acted with unsatisfactory
conduct in breach of section
127(1) of The Legal Professions Act 1985.
<P>

2.	An order granting the appellants Leave to Appeal for the court to hear and
determine the appeal."
<P>

3  	Such a summons is subject to the requirements of SCR Pt 51A. Part
51A Rule 2(6) requires that such a summons shall be accompanied
by a statement
setting out the nature of the case which it is sought to make on the projected
appeal; the questions involved in the
projected appeal; and the reasons why
leave should be given for the projected appeal. 
<P>

4  	Presumably in conformity with that requirement of the Rules, a
document was filed on 29 July 1999. A photocopy of the document
is attached,
for ease of reference, to this judgment.
<P>

5  	The notice of motion filed on 5 August 1999 seeks, at the
instance of the appellants, the following relief:
<P>

"1	The appellants seek leave to amend the Notice of Appeal for an order that
the payment of the costs being appealed from the decision
of the costs assessor
be stayed until the leave to appeal is determined or until further order.
<P>

2.	Costs reserved."
<P>

6  	The notice of motion filed on 19 August 1999 is that of the
respondent. The notice of motion seeks the following relief:
<P>

"1.	The Appellants' Notice of Motion dated 5 August 1999 and returnable on 19
August 1999 amending the Appellants' Notice of Appeal
dated 26 May 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

2.	The Appellants' Notice of Appeal and Summons dated 26 May 1999 be struck out
as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
<P>

3.	The Appellants' Notice of Appeal and Summons dated 26 May 1999 be dismissed
as being out of time.
<P>

4.	Costs."
<P>

7  	The Amended Summons filed on 13 September 1999 seeks at the
instance of the appellants the following relief:
<P>

"1.	An order pursuant to part 51A rule 3(3) extending the time for the
lodgement of this appeal. 
<P>

2.	An order granting the applicants leave to appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208M</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a> from the determination of Ross Graham Pannifex
costs assessor, dated the 16th of April 1999 in matter no. 92674 of 98. 
<P>

3.	Any other order which the court deems fit.
<P>

4.	Costs of this summons."
<P>

8  	At all stages of the proceedings before this Court, the
respondent has been represented by counsel; Mr. Donnelly has been represented
by Mr. Oshlack, to whom the Court granted leave to appear as agent for Mr.
Donnelly; and Mr. Mundine has appeared for himself.
<P>

9  	The background to the proceedings in this Court is provided by
antecedent proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. The
material before
this Court as to the nature of, and the course of, the proceedings in the Land
and Environment Court, is incomplete.
It appears, nonetheless, that there were
proceedings instituted in the Land and Environment Court by the appellants
against two companies
of which the present respondent was one. The essence of
the proceedings was a claim by the appellants to an entitlement, the nature
and
extent of which is not clear from the evidence before this Court, to native
title over certain land.
<P>

10  	On 2 June 1998 Talbot J of the Land and Environment Court gave
judgment in favour of the two companies. The effect of that
judgment was either
to dismiss or to strike out essential parts of the claim as formulated in the
Land and Environment Court by the
appellants. Those who were then advising the
appellants appear to have taken the view that what was left of the appellants'
claims
could not succeed; and so the undismissed balance of the claims as
originally formulated in the Land and Environment Court was discontinued.
<P>

11  	In the wake of those developments, it became necessary for
Talbot J to consider the question of costs. This his Honour did
in a judgment
published on 9 July 1998. His Honour ordered that the applicants pay, so far as
is at present relevant, the costs of
the respondent of the proceedings in the
Land and Environment Court. Talbot J, in the course of giving his Honour's
reasons for judgment,
observed that the legal issues raised before the Land and
Environment Court <i>"were all comparatively clear"</i>. His Honour added:
<i>"This case cannot be regarded as a `test case' of difficult or novel legal
issues"</i>.
<P>

12  	The effect of the costs order made by Talbot J entitled the
respondent to make an application pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s202.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.202</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act 1987</a> (NSW)</b>, ["the Act']. That section, so far as is at present
material, provides as follows:
<P>

"(1)	A person ............... who is entitled to receive ............... costs
as a result of an order for the payment of an unspecified
amount of costs made
by a court or a tribunal may apply to the proper officer of the Supreme Court
for an assessment of the whole
of, or any part of, those costs."
<P>

13  	In due course the respondent made such an application; and Mr.
Ross G. Pannifex, a costs assessor for the purposes of the Act,
had the
respondent's application referred to him for assessment. In due course Mr.
Pannifex determined that the respondent was entitled
to recover from the
appellants a sum of costs assessed at $87,504.
<P>

14  	Mr. Pannifex was required by the Act to proceed, thereupon, in
manner provided by s.208J of the Act. So far as is at present
material, that
section provides as follows:
<P>

"(1)	On making a determination, a costs assessor is to issue to each party a
certificate that sets out the determination.
.......................................

<P>

(3)	In the case of an amount of costs that has not been paid, the certificate
is, on the filing of the certificate in the office
or registry of a court
having jurisdiction to order the payment of that amount of money, and with no
further action, taken to be
a judgment of that court for the amount of unpaid
costs...................................................................................
"
<P>

15  	Mr. Pannifex's certificate as to his costs assessment has been
filed in the Land and Environment Court. This has had the effect,
pursuant to
s.208J(3) of the Act, of making the appellants liable to the respondent, as
though upon an enforceable judgment of the
Land and Environment Court, for a
judgment debt of $87,504 as stipulated in Mr. Pannifex's certificate. 
<P>

16  	The appellants wish to dispute their liability to pay that
judgment debt. In order to do so, it is necessary for them to go
behind Mr.
Pannifex's certificate. In order to do that, the appellants must have recourse
to either or both of ss 208L and 208M of
the Act. Section 208L makes provision
for an appeal to this Court <i>"as to a matter of law"</i> by a party who is
dissatisfied with a determination of a costs assessor. Section 208M provides
that such a dissatisfied party may
seek leave of this Court to appeal against
the determination of the costs assessor, there being no restriction of such an
application
for leave to an application made <i>"as to a matter of law"</i>.
<P>

17  	It was not contended by any party to the proceedings in this
Court that s.208L applied in the case of the present appellants.
The present
appellants seek, rather, to bring their case within s.208M of the Act. The
relevant provisions of s.208M are as follows:
<P>

"(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in accordance
with the Rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of
the court to appeal to the
court against the determination of the application made by a costs assessor.
<P>

(2)	[not applicable in the case of the present appellants]
<P>

(3)	The Supreme Court ....................... may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine
the appeal.
<P>

(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or evidence
in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the original
proceedings, may be given. 
<P>

(5)	After deciding the questions the subject of the appeal, the Supreme Court
............... may, unless it affirms the cost assessor's
decision, make such
determination in relation to the application as, in its opinion, should have
been made by the costs assessor."
<P>

18  	As I have earlier noted, SCR Part 51A is applicable to an
application, made pursuant to s.208M of the Act, for leave to appeal
to this
Court against a determination of a costs assessor. More particularly, Pt 51A, R
2(3) provides that the summons for leave
to appeal <i>"shall be filed within 14
days after the material date or within such extended time as the court may
fix"</i>. As to an extension of time under Rule 2A(3), it is provided by Rule
2A(5) that the Court may extend time under sub-rule (3) <i>"at any
time"</i>.
<P>

19  	The application in any particular case of r.2A(3) depends,
obviously, upon the correct definition of <i>"the material date"</i>. This
expression is itself defined in R.2 of Part 51A. So far as is at present
material, it is there provided that <i>"material date"</i> means <i>"the date
on which notice of the decision was given to the person who wishes to appeal by
or on behalf of the person who made the
decision"</i>. 
<P>

20  	A copy of the certificate issued by the costs assessor is in
evidence. It bears the date 16 April 1999; and there is no reason
to think that
it was in fact issued on any other date. 
<P>

21  	As to the giving to the appellants of notice of the certified
decision of the costs assessor, there is before this Court evidence
in the form
of a letter written on 9 September 1999 by Mr. Pannifex, the costs assessor, to
the solicitors for the respondent. That
letter reads, formal parts omitted, as
follows:
<P>

"I refer to a telephone conversation with Rebbecca Mohr on 9th September 1999
and note you have my letter of 15th April 1999 written
to both parties and the
certificate in Forms 3 and 4 which were enclosed with it. 
<P>

I note the certificates were each dated 16th April 1999, and confirm my
recollection is that I prepared the letter to both parties
on 15th April and
prepared and signed the certificates on 16th.
<P>

While I have no postage book or recollection independently of my file, my
invariable practice is to post the letters and certificates
to all parties as
soon as possible after the same have been prepared.
<P>

I note 16th April 1999 was a Friday. I am sure that the above letter directed
to both parties and enclosed certificates were posted
by me to both parties
either on that day, or the following Monday 19th April 1999."
<P>

22  	Miss Mohr, to whom reference is made in Mr. Pannifex's letter,
is the solicitor having carriage, on behalf of the respondents,
of the
proceedings in this Court. Miss Mohr has sworn an affidavit dated 10 September
1999 to which she has annexed, among other
things, copies of two letters. One
of them is a copy of the letter from Mr. Pannifex and to which I have referred.
The other is a
copy of a letter, also written by Mr. Pannifex, but dated 15th
April 1999. It is a letter addressed by name both to the solicitors
for the
respondent and to the solicitors for the appellants. It sets out various
matters explanatory of the ultimate decision reached
by the costs assessor and
certified by him in the certificate dated 16 April 1999. Miss Mohr deposes to
the fact that a copy of that
letter reached the office of the respondents'
solicitors on 19 April 1999. 
<P>

23  	Miss Mohr was not required for cross-examination on her
affidavit. There is no other reason to doubt the reliability of the
matters to
which she has deposed in her affidavit; and I accept, accordingly, the contents
of that affidavit evidence. Mr. Pannifex
was not subpoenaed either by the
appellants or by the respondent to give evidence or to produce documents; with
the result that the
Court has had no assistance from Mr. Pannifex save the bare
assistance afforded by him in his letter dated 9 September 1999. There
is no
reason that I can see to doubt the veracity of what Mr. Pannifex says in his
letter; and I accept, therefore, as reliable the
statements contained in his
letter.
<P>

24  	The position of the appellants respecting their receipt of
notice of the certificate of the costs assessor is, to say the least,
imprecise. 
<P>

25  	Mr. Mundine, who appeared, as previously noted, unrepresented,
addressed the Court during the course of the recent hearing.
What Mr. Mundine
then said conveyed with complete clarity the continuing dissatisfaction and
sense of grievance which he bears in
connection with anything and everything
concerned with the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court, including the
assessment
of the costs of the proceedings in that Court. It is equally clear
that Mr.Mundine feels, and feels very strongly indeed, that such
legal
representation as he has hitherto had, has been both incompetent and
ineffective. If I have understood Mr. Mundine correctly,
he is strongly of the
view that some at least of the things done by his former solicitors were done
without his instructions. I am
not sure whether Mr. Mundine's final position is
that he has never seen the certificate; or whether his final position is that
he
has seen it, but only in very recent times, and then well after the date of
issue of the certificate. Mr. Mundine did not give evidence
before this Court;
nor did he call other oral evidence or tender any documentary evidence.
<P>

26  	Mr. Donnelly's position is marginally clearer. On 13 September
1999 Mr. Donnelly swore an affidavit in connection with the
hearing before this
Court. In paragraph 5 of that affidavit, Mr. Donnelly says that the first he
knew of the costs assessment or
of its ultimate outcome was when Mr. Oshlack
showed him, on or about 18 May 1999, a copy of the determination: (by which I
take him
to mean a copy of the certificate dated 16 April 1999). In paragraph 6
of that affidavit Mr. Donnelly deposes as follows:
<P>

"I received no communication at all from Craddock, Murray and Neumann about the
costs assessment while it was in progress. Nor did
I have any knowledge that I
had a right to take part in any way with the process of the costs assessment.
If I had know that I had
such a right, and that an assessment was in progress,
I would have wanted to take part in it."
<P>

27  	Mr. Donnelly had sworn, on 6 September 1999, another affidavit
in connection with the hearing before this Court. In that affidavit
he sought
leave to refer to, among other paragraphs, paragraph 6 of an affidavit that he
had sworn on 19 May 1999 in connection with
the proceedings in the Land and
Environment Court. In paragraph 6 of that affidavit in the Land and Environment
Court proceedings,
Mr. Donnelly deposes as follows:
<P>

"Annexed to this affidavit and marked with the letter D is a copy of the
Certificate As To Determination Of Costs and say that I
have not seen this
document before."
<P>

28  	It will be observed that there is a conflict between what Mr.
Donnelly has sworn in paragraph 5 of his affidavit of 13 September
1999, and
what he had earlier sworn in his affidavit of 19 May 1999, as to the date upon
which he first had notice that there had
been a costs determination and that a
certificate of its outcome had issued from the costs assessor. This discrepancy
is not without
significance in proceedings which turn, in a very real sense,
upon the proper determination of the relevant <i>"material date"</i>. The
discrepancy stands, however, entirely unexplained by Mr. Donnelly. Mr.
Donnelly, like Mr. Mundine, gave no evidence before this
Court.
<P>

29  	The appellants relied, among other affidavits, upon an affidavit
which Mr. Oshlack had sworn on 26 May 1999. Annexures "A"
and "B" to that
affidavit are copies of documents addressed to, and apparently communicated to,
the Registrar of the Land and Environment
Court. One document pertains to Mr.
Mundine; and the other to Mr. Donnelly. The documents give notice that Mr.
Oshlack is appointed
as representative in connection with the proceedings in
the Land and Environment Court. Mr. Mundine's document is dated 29 April
1999.
Mr. Donnelly's document is dated 18 May 1999. I think that it is reasonable to
infer from those documents, and I do infer accordingly,
that Mr. Neumann
remained on the record until 29 April 1999 as Mr. Mundine's solicitor; and
until 18 May 1999 as Mr. Donnelly's solicitor.
<P>

30  	Such a state of affairs prompts, obviously, an inquiry as to
what Mr. Neumann might have to say about the date of any receipt
by him of the
letters written by Mr. Pannifex on 15 and 16 April 1999. It is, however, the
case that the Court has no evidence whatsoever
of Mr. Neumann's stance on that
all-important question. No attempt was made by the appellants, so far as I can
see, to subpoena Mr.
Neumann to give evidence; or, if that were thought too
risky from a forensic point of view, to subpoena the production of his relevant
office file.
<P>

31  	At the hearing before this Court, evidence was admitted of a
letter written and delivered on 13 September 1999 to Mr. Neumann
by the
respondent's solicitors. That letter sought, put simply, the assistance in
various respects of Mr. Neumann in connection with
the proceedings then current
before this Court. As I understand the fact, no response was received to this
letter.
<P>

32  	Given the foregoing tangled, imprecise and generally unhelpful
state of affairs, this Court must do its best on the probabilities,
given the
evidence as it actually stands. Approaching the matter on that basis, I am
satisfied on the probabilities of the following
things: <i>first</i>, that Mr.
Pannifex did forward by pre-paid post to Mr. Neumann, and in accordance with
what Mr. Pannifex says in that regard in his
letter of 9 September 1999, both a
copy of his letter dated 15 April 1999 and a copy of his certificate dated 16
April 1999; <i>secondly</i>, that such documents were received in Mr. Neumann's
office either on, or not later than, Monday 19 April 1999; and <i>thirdly</i>,
that, as at such date of receipt, Mr. Neumann continued to hold instructions
from both of the appellants to represent them as their
legal representative in
connection with all aspects of the proceedings in the Land and Environment
Court, including the aspect of
the implementation of the costs order of Talbot
J. 
<P>

33  	The foregoing findings entail that the <i>"material date"
</i>for present purposes is 19 April 1999. That entails, in turn, that the 14
day period fixed by Pt 51A Rule 2A(3) expired on 3 May 1999.
As is noted in the
chronology at the commencement of the present judgment, the first notification
of an intention to seek leave to
appeal was the filing of a Summons on 26 May
1999; and that document was not only out of time, but was irregular in form in
that
it was not accompanied by such a statement as is required by Rule 2A(6),
such statement not having been filed until 29 July 1999.
<P>

34  	The foregoing findings entail that there is an onus cast upon
the appellants to show cause why they should have, in accordance
with Pt 51A
Rule 2A(3) and (5), an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal.
In discharging that onus, the appellants
are required, conformably with well
established principle, to answer the following questions:
<P>

1.	Why was a Summons seeking leave to appeal not filed on or before 3 May
1999?
<P>

2.	Why was such a Summons not filed after 3 May 1999 but sooner than 26 May
1999?
<P>

3.	Is there practical utility in granting an extension of time for the filing
of an application for leave to appeal; that is to
say, if such an extension of
time be granted, is it reasonably <i>"on the cards"</i> - (to adopt the
expression used by Gibbs CJ in <b>Alister v The Queen</b> [1984] 154 CLR 404 at
414) - that leave to appeal will be granted?
<P>

35  	In my opinion, the answer to question 1 is, plainly: no. In the
absence of any evidence about what Mr. Neumann did or did not
do in connection
with the costs assessment and the resulting certificate of the costs assessor,
I do not consider the appellants
to have given any, let alone any sufficient,
answer to this question.
<P>

36  	The answer to question 2, also, is in my opinion: no.
<P>

37  	As to question 3, I have come to the conclusion that it, too,
should be answered: no. Subject to one proviso, I cannot find
in the evidence
before this Court any, let alone any coherent, formulation of the complaint(s)
that the appellants have about the
rulings and the associated calculations of
the costs assessor. The proviso concerns that part of the statement lodged
pursuant to
Rule 2A(6), being that part of the document commencing with the
words <i>"Matters that should have been raised in submissions to the costs
assessor would include ..........."</i>. It suffices to say that there is not,
in the material before this Court, a scintilla of evidence to support either of
the propositions
there advanced; or, more importantly, to establish that either
or both of those propositions, if established in point of fact, might
reasonably be supposed to entail a revision of substance to the costs
assessment.
<P>

38  	I can now summarise, as follows, the conclusions to which I have
come:
<P>

<b>SUPREME COURT OF</b>
<P>

<b>NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>SULLY J</b>
<P>

<b>23 September 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>11274/.99 - Andrew DONNELLY &amp; David MUNDINE  v  ROSS MINING
NL</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Before the Court are the following
applications:
<P>

1.	An application by way of Summons filed on 26 May 1999.
<P>

2.	A Notice of Motion filed on 5 August 1999.
<P>

3.	A Notice of Motion filed on 19 August 1999.
<P>

4.	An Amended Summons filed on 13 September 1999.
<P>

2  	In the Summons filed on 26 May 1999 Mr. Andrew Donnelly and Mr.
David Mundine, (to whom I shall refer for the sake of convenience
as <i>"the
appellants"</i>), seek against Ross Mining NL, (to which entity I shall refer
for the sake of convenience as <i>"the respondent"</i>), relief expressed as
follows:
<P>

"1.	A declaration that the solicitors for the Appellants for the purposes of
the Costs assessment had acted with unsatisfactory
conduct in breach of section
127(1) of The Legal Professions Act 1985.
<P>

2.	An order granting the appellants Leave to Appeal for the court to hear and
determine the appeal."
<P>

3  	Such a summons is subject to the requirements of SCR Pt 51A. Part
51A Rule 2(6) requires that such a summons shall be accompanied
by a statement
setting out the nature of the case which it is sought to make on the projected
appeal; the questions involved in the
projected appeal; and the reasons why
leave should be given for the projected appeal. 
<P>

4  	Presumably in conformity with that requirement of the Rules, a
document was filed on 29 July 1999. A photocopy of the document
is attached,
for ease of reference, to this judgment.
<P>

5  	The notice of motion filed on 5 August 1999 seeks, at the
instance of the appellants, the following relief:
<P>

"1	The appellants seek leave to amend the Notice of Appeal for an order that
the payment of the costs being appealed from the decision
of the costs assessor
be stayed until the leave to appeal is determined or until further order.
<P>

2.	Costs reserved."
<P>

6  	The notice of motion filed on 19 August 1999 is that of the
respondent. The notice of motion seeks the following relief:
<P>

"1.	The Appellants' Notice of Motion dated 5 August 1999 and returnable on 19
August 1999 amending the Appellants' Notice of Appeal
dated 26 May 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

2.	The Appellants' Notice of Appeal and Summons dated 26 May 1999 be struck out
as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
<P>

3.	The Appellants' Notice of Appeal and Summons dated 26 May 1999 be dismissed
as being out of time.
<P>

4.	Costs."
<P>

7  	The Amended Summons filed on 13 September 1999 seeks at the
instance of the appellants the following relief:
<P>

"1.	An order pursuant to part 51A rule 3(3) extending the time for the
lodgement of this appeal. 
<P>

2.	An order granting the applicants leave to appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208M</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a> from the determination of Ross Graham Pannifex
costs assessor, dated the 16th of April 1999 in matter no. 92674 of 98. 
<P>

3.	Any other order which the court deems fit.
<P>

4.	Costs of this summons."
<P>

8  	At all stages of the proceedings before this Court, the
respondent has been represented by counsel; Mr. Donnelly has been represented
by Mr. Oshlack, to whom the Court granted leave to appear as agent for Mr.
Donnelly; and Mr. Mundine has appeared for himself.
<P>

9  	The background to the proceedings in this Court is provided by
antecedent proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. The
material before
this Court as to the nature of, and the course of, the proceedings in the Land
and Environment Court, is incomplete.
It appears, nonetheless, that there were
proceedings instituted in the Land and Environment Court by the appellants
against two companies
of which the present respondent was one. The essence of
the proceedings was a claim by the appellants to an entitlement, the nature
and
extent of which is not clear from the evidence before this Court, to native
title over certain land.
<P>

10  	On 2 June 1998 Talbot J of the Land and Environment Court gave
judgment in favour of the two companies. The effect of that
judgment was either
to dismiss or to strike out essential parts of the claim as formulated in the
Land and Environment Court by the
appellants. Those who were then advising the
appellants appear to have taken the view that what was left of the appellants'
claims
could not succeed; and so the undismissed balance of the claims as
originally formulated in the Land and Environment Court was discontinued.
<P>

11  	In the wake of those developments, it became necessary for
Talbot J to consider the question of costs. This his Honour did
in a judgment
published on 9 July 1998. His Honour ordered that the applicants pay, so far as
is at present relevant, the costs of
the respondent of the proceedings in the
Land and Environment Court. Talbot J, in the course of giving his Honour's
reasons for judgment,
observed that the legal issues raised before the Land and
Environment Court <i>"were all comparatively clear"</i>. His Honour added:
<i>"This case cannot be regarded as a `test case' of difficult or novel legal
issues"</i>.
<P>

12  	The effect of the costs order made by Talbot J entitled the
respondent to make an application pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s202.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.202</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act 1987</a> (NSW)</b>, ["the Act']. That section, so far as is at present
material, provides as follows:
<P>

"(1)	A person ............... who is entitled to receive ............... costs
as a result of an order for the payment of an unspecified
amount of costs made
by a court or a tribunal may apply to the proper officer of the Supreme Court
for an assessment of the whole
of, or any part of, those costs."
<P>

13  	In due course the respondent made such an application; and Mr.
Ross G. Pannifex, a costs assessor for the purposes of the Act,
had the
respondent's application referred to him for assessment. In due course Mr.
Pannifex determined that the respondent was entitled
to recover from the
appellants a sum of costs assessed at $87,504.
<P>

14  	Mr. Pannifex was required by the Act to proceed, thereupon, in
manner provided by s.208J of the Act. So far as is at present
material, that
section provides as follows:
<P>

"(1)	On making a determination, a costs assessor is to issue to each party a
certificate that sets out the determination.
.......................................

<P>

(3)	In the case of an amount of costs that has not been paid, the certificate
is, on the filing of the certificate in the office
or registry of a court
having jurisdiction to order the payment of that amount of money, and with no
further action, taken to be
a judgment of that court for the amount of unpaid
costs...................................................................................
"
<P>

15  	Mr. Pannifex's certificate as to his costs assessment has been
filed in the Land and Environment Court. This has had the effect,
pursuant to
s.208J(3) of the Act, of making the appellants liable to the respondent, as
though upon an enforceable judgment of the
Land and Environment Court, for a
judgment debt of $87,504 as stipulated in Mr. Pannifex's certificate. 
<P>

16  	The appellants wish to dispute their liability to pay that
judgment debt. In order to do so, it is necessary for them to go
behind Mr.
Pannifex's certificate. In order to do that, the appellants must have recourse
to either or both of ss 208L and 208M of
the Act. Section 208L makes provision
for an appeal to this Court <i>"as to a matter of law"</i> by a party who is
dissatisfied with a determination of a costs assessor. Section 208M provides
that such a dissatisfied party may
seek leave of this Court to appeal against
the determination of the costs assessor, there being no restriction of such an
application
for leave to an application made <i>"as to a matter of law"</i>.
<P>

17  	It was not contended by any party to the proceedings in this
Court that s.208L applied in the case of the present appellants.
The present
appellants seek, rather, to bring their case within s.208M of the Act. The
relevant provisions of s.208M are as follows:
<P>

"(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in accordance
with the Rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of
the court to appeal to the
court against the determination of the application made by a costs assessor.
<P>

(2)	[not applicable in the case of the present appellants]
<P>

(3)	The Supreme Court ....................... may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine
the appeal.
<P>

(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or evidence
in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the original
proceedings, may be given. 
<P>

(5)	After deciding the questions the subject of the appeal, the Supreme Court
............... may, unless it affirms the cost assessor's
decision, make such
determination in relation to the application as, in its opinion, should have
been made by the costs assessor."
<P>

18  	As I have earlier noted, SCR Part 51A is applicable to an
application, made pursuant to s.208M of the Act, for leave to appeal
to this
Court against a determination of a costs assessor. More particularly, Pt 51A, R
2(3) provides that the summons for leave
to appeal <i>"shall be filed within 14
days after the material date or within such extended time as the court may
fix"</i>. As to an extension of time under Rule 2A(3), it is provided by Rule
2A(5) that the Court may extend time under sub-rule (3) <i>"at any
time"</i>.
<P>

19  	The application in any particular case of r.2A(3) depends,
obviously, upon the correct definition of <i>"the material date"</i>. This
expression is itself defined in R.2 of Part 51A. So far as is at present
material, it is there provided that <i>"material date"</i> means <i>"the date
on which notice of the decision was given to the person who wishes to appeal by
or on behalf of the person who made the
decision"</i>. 
<P>

20  	A copy of the certificate issued by the costs assessor is in
evidence. It bears the date 16 April 1999; and there is no reason
to think that
it was in fact issued on any other date. 
<P>

21  	As to the giving to the appellants of notice of the certified
decision of the costs assessor, there is before this Court evidence
in the form
of a letter written on 9 September 1999 by Mr. Pannifex, the costs assessor, to
the solicitors for the respondent. That
letter reads, formal parts omitted, as
follows:
<P>

"I refer to a telephone conversation with Rebbecca Mohr on 9th September 1999
and note you have my letter of 15th April 1999 written
to both parties and the
certificate in Forms 3 and 4 which were enclosed with it. 
<P>

I note the certificates were each dated 16th April 1999, and confirm my
recollection is that I prepared the letter to both parties
on 15th April and
prepared and signed the certificates on 16th.
<P>

While I have no postage book or recollection independently of my file, my
invariable practice is to post the letters and certificates
to all parties as
soon as possible after the same have been prepared.
<P>

I note 16th April 1999 was a Friday. I am sure that the above letter directed
to both parties and enclosed certificates were posted
by me to both parties
either on that day, or the following Monday 19th April 1999."
<P>

22  	Miss Mohr, to whom reference is made in Mr. Pannifex's letter,
is the solicitor having carriage, on behalf of the respondents,
of the
proceedings in this Court. Miss Mohr has sworn an affidavit dated 10 September
1999 to which she has annexed, among other
things, copies of two letters. One
of them is a copy of the letter from Mr. Pannifex and to which I have referred.
The other is a
copy of a letter, also written by Mr. Pannifex, but dated 15th
April 1999. It is a letter addressed by name both to the solicitors
for the
respondent and to the solicitors for the appellants. It sets out various
matters explanatory of the ultimate decision reached
by the costs assessor and
certified by him in the certificate dated 16 April 1999. Miss Mohr deposes to
the fact that a copy of that
letter reached the office of the respondents'
solicitors on 19 April 1999. 
<P>

23  	Miss Mohr was not required for cross-examination on her
affidavit. There is no other reason to doubt the reliability of the
matters to
which she has deposed in her affidavit; and I accept, accordingly, the contents
of that affidavit evidence. Mr. Pannifex
was not subpoenaed either by the
appellants or by the respondent to give evidence or to produce documents; with
the result that the
Court has had no assistance from Mr. Pannifex save the bare
assistance afforded by him in his letter dated 9 September 1999. There
is no
reason that I can see to doubt the veracity of what Mr. Pannifex says in his
letter; and I accept, therefore, as reliable the
statements contained in his
letter.
<P>

24  	The position of the appellants respecting their receipt of
notice of the certificate of the costs assessor is, to say the least,
imprecise. 
<P>

25  	Mr. Mundine, who appeared, as previously noted, unrepresented,
addressed the Court during the course of the recent hearing.
What Mr. Mundine
then said conveyed with complete clarity the continuing dissatisfaction and
sense of grievance which he bears in
connection with anything and everything
concerned with the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court, including the
assessment
of the costs of the proceedings in that Court. It is equally clear
that Mr.Mundine feels, and feels very strongly indeed, that such
legal
representation as he has hitherto had, has been both incompetent and
ineffective. If I have understood Mr. Mundine correctly,
he is strongly of the
view that some at least of the things done by his former solicitors were done
without his instructions. I am
not sure whether Mr. Mundine's final position is
that he has never seen the certificate; or whether his final position is that
he
has seen it, but only in very recent times, and then well after the date of
issue of the certificate. Mr. Mundine did not give evidence
before this Court;
nor did he call other oral evidence or tender any documentary evidence.
<P>

26  	Mr. Donnelly's position is marginally clearer. On 13 September
1999 Mr. Donnelly swore an affidavit in connection with the
hearing before this
Court. In paragraph 5 of that affidavit, Mr. Donnelly says that the first he
knew of the costs assessment or
of its ultimate outcome was when Mr. Oshlack
showed him, on or about 18 May 1999, a copy of the determination: (by which I
take him
to mean a copy of the certificate dated 16 April 1999). In paragraph 6
of that affidavit Mr. Donnelly deposes as follows:
<P>

"I received no communication at all from Craddock, Murray and Neumann about the
costs assessment while it was in progress. Nor did
I have any knowledge that I
had a right to take part in any way with the process of the costs assessment.
If I had know that I had
such a right, and that an assessment was in progress,
I would have wanted to take part in it."
<P>

27  	Mr. Donnelly had sworn, on 6 September 1999, another affidavit
in connection with the hearing before this Court. In that affidavit
he sought
leave to refer to, among other paragraphs, paragraph 6 of an affidavit that he
had sworn on 19 May 1999 in connection with
the proceedings in the Land and
Environment Court. In paragraph 6 of that affidavit in the Land and Environment
Court proceedings,
Mr. Donnelly deposes as follows:
<P>

"Annexed to this affidavit and marked with the letter D is a copy of the
Certificate As To Determination Of Costs and say that I
have not seen this
document before."
<P>

28  	It will be observed that there is a conflict between what Mr.
Donnelly has sworn in paragraph 5 of his affidavit of 13 September
1999, and
what he had earlier sworn in his affidavit of 19 May 1999, as to the date upon
which he first had notice that there had
been a costs determination and that a
certificate of its outcome had issued from the costs assessor. This discrepancy
is not without
significance in proceedings which turn, in a very real sense,
upon the proper determination of the relevant <i>"material date"</i>. The
discrepancy stands, however, entirely unexplained by Mr. Donnelly. Mr.
Donnelly, like Mr. Mundine, gave no evidence before this
Court.
<P>

29  	The appellants relied, among other affidavits, upon an affidavit
which Mr. Oshlack had sworn on 26 May 1999. Annexures "A"
and "B" to that
affidavit are copies of documents addressed to, and apparently communicated to,
the Registrar of the Land and Environment
Court. One document pertains to Mr.
Mundine; and the other to Mr. Donnelly. The documents give notice that Mr.
Oshlack is appointed
as representative in connection with the proceedings in
the Land and Environment Court. Mr. Mundine's document is dated 29 April
1999.
Mr. Donnelly's document is dated 18 May 1999. I think that it is reasonable to
infer from those documents, and I do infer accordingly,
that Mr. Neumann
remained on the record until 29 April 1999 as Mr. Mundine's solicitor; and
until 18 May 1999 as Mr. Donnelly's solicitor.
<P>

30  	Such a state of affairs prompts, obviously, an inquiry as to
what Mr. Neumann might have to say about the date of any receipt
by him of the
letters written by Mr. Pannifex on 15 and 16 April 1999. It is, however, the
case that the Court has no evidence whatsoever
of Mr. Neumann's stance on that
all-important question. No attempt was made by the appellants, so far as I can
see, to subpoena Mr.
Neumann to give evidence; or, if that were thought too
risky from a forensic point of view, to subpoena the production of his relevant
office file.
<P>

31  	At the hearing before this Court, evidence was admitted of a
letter written and delivered on 13 September 1999 to Mr. Neumann
by the
respondent's solicitors. That letter sought, put simply, the assistance in
various respects of Mr. Neumann in connection with
the proceedings then current
before this Court. As I understand the fact, no response was received to this
letter.
<P>

32  	Given the foregoing tangled, imprecise and generally unhelpful
state of affairs, this Court must do its best on the probabilities,
given the
evidence as it actually stands. Approaching the matter on that basis, I am
satisfied on the probabilities of the following
things: <i>first</i>, that Mr.
Pannifex did forward by pre-paid post to Mr. Neumann, and in accordance with
what Mr. Pannifex says in that regard in his
letter of 9 September 1999, both a
copy of his letter dated 15 April 1999 and a copy of his certificate dated 16
April 1999; <i>secondly</i>, that such documents were received in Mr. Neumann's
office either on, or not later than, Monday 19 April 1999; and <i>thirdly</i>,
that, as at such date of receipt, Mr. Neumann continued to hold instructions
from both of the appellants to represent them as their
legal representative in
connection with all aspects of the proceedings in the Land and Environment
Court, including the aspect of
the implementation of the costs order of Talbot
J. 
<P>

33  	The foregoing findings entail that the <i>"material date"
</i>for present purposes is 19 April 1999. That entails, in turn, that the 14
day period fixed by Pt 51A Rule 2A(3) expired on 3 May 1999.
As is noted in the
chronology at the commencement of the present judgment, the first notification
of an intention to seek leave to
appeal was the filing of a Summons on 26 May
1999; and that document was not only out of time, but was irregular in form in
that
it was not accompanied by such a statement as is required by Rule 2A(6),
such statement not having been filed until 29 July 1999.
<P>

34  	The foregoing findings entail that there is an onus cast upon
the appellants to show cause why they should have, in accordance
with Pt 51A
Rule 2A(3) and (5), an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal.
In discharging that onus, the appellants
are required, conformably with well
established principle, to answer the following questions:
<P>

1.	Why was a Summons seeking leave to appeal not filed on or before 3 May
1999?
<P>

2.	Why was such a Summons not filed after 3 May 1999 but sooner than 26 May
1999?
<P>

3.	Is there practical utility in granting an extension of time for the filing
of an application for leave to appeal; that is to
say, if such an extension of
time be granted, is it reasonably <i>"on the cards"</i> - (to adopt the
expression used by Gibbs CJ in <b>Alister v The Queen</b> [1984] 154 CLR 404 at
414) - that leave to appeal will be granted?
<P>

35  	In my opinion, the answer to question 1 is, plainly: no. In the
absence of any evidence about what Mr. Neumann did or did not
do in connection
with the costs assessment and the resulting certificate of the costs assessor,
I do not consider the appellants
to have given any, let alone any sufficient,
answer to this question.
<P>

36  	The answer to question 2, also, is in my opinion: no.
<P>

37  	As to question 3, I have come to the conclusion that it, too,
should be answered: no. Subject to one proviso, I cannot find
in the evidence
before this Court any, let alone any coherent, formulation of the complaint(s)
that the appellants have about the
rulings and the associated calculations of
the costs assessor. The proviso concerns that part of the statement lodged
pursuant to
Rule 2A(6), being that part of the document commencing with the
words <i>"Matters that should have been raised in submissions to the costs
assessor would include ..........."</i>. It suffices to say that there is not,
in the material before this Court, a scintilla of evidence to support either of
the propositions
there advanced; or, more importantly, to establish that either
or both of those propositions, if established in point of fact, might
reasonably be supposed to entail a revision of substance to the costs
assessment.
<P>

38  	I can now summarise, as follows, the conclusions to which I have
come:
<P>

<i>As to the Summons Filed on 26 May 1999:</i>
<P>

1.	I dismiss the claim for relief in paragraph 1. It is not relief of a kind
contemplated by s.208M of the Act.
<P>

2.	I strike out the claim for relief in paragraph 2 as being a claim made out
of time.
<P>

3.	I order the appellants to pay the costs of the respondent of this
Summons.
<P>

<i>As to the Notice of Motion filed on 5 August 1999:</i>
<P>

There is no utility remaining to this Notice of Motion. I dismiss it with
costs.
<P>

<i>As to the Amended Summons filed on 13 September 1999:</i>
<P>

1.	I refuse the relief sought in paragraphs 1, 2 and 4.
<P>

2.	There being no other utility to the Amended Summons, I dismiss it with
costs.
<P>

<i>As to Notice of Motion filed on 19 August 1999:</i>
<P>

Given the foregoing orders, there is no purpose to be served in making orders
particular to this Notice of Motion. I strike it out
with no order as to
costs.
<P>

39  	I make formal orders in accordance with the foregoing summary.
The exhibits may be returned.
