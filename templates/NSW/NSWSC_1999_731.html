Revised on 29 July 1999
<P>

<b>50042/98  -  CENTURY MEDICAL INC  v  THLD LIMITED (Formerly known as
Telectronics Holdings Limited) AND SIX OTHERS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:    There is before the Court a notice of motion
filed on 1 March 1999 in which the plaintiff, Century Medical Inc,
seeks the
following orders:
<P>

1.  Order that the plaintiff be granted leave to file and serve a further
amended summons on terms that the plaintiff pay the costs
of and occasioned by
the amendment;
<P>

2.  Order that the time for the plaintiff to file its further amended summons
be extended from 12 February 1999 to 5 March 1999.
<P>

The application is for costs to be costs in the cause.
<P>

2   	The proceedings commenced on 9 April 1998 upon the filing
of a summons in the Commercial Division of the Court.  An amended
summons was
later filed on 13 November 1998.  That amended summons came before Rolfe J in
November 1998, when the defendants, THLD
Limited and others, by motion dated 24
November 1998, sought to have the summons struck out.  By judgment delivered on
27 November
1998, his Honour directed that the amended summons be struck out
and granted leave to the plaintiff to file a further amended summons,
directing
that this take place by 4pm on Friday 5 February 1999.
<P>

3   	By letter dated 4 February 1999, the plaintiff's solicitors
informed the defendant's solicitors that they were in the process
of finalising
a further amended summons which, it was said, had been completely redrafted.
The plaintiff's solicitors said that they
had the objective of filing and
serving that summons on 5 February as ordered by the Court.  However, the
plaintiff's solicitors
advised that Mr Saegusa of the plaintiff had been abroad
that week and would not be returning to Japan until Wednesday or Thursday
on
the following week, and in view of that, advised that the plaintiff did not
anticipate being in a position to file the further
amended summons before
Friday 12 February.  The plaintiff's solicitors sought the defendant's consent
to a filing of the further
amended summons on or before 12 February.
<P>

4   	By letter dated 8 February 1999, the defendant's solicitors
advised that they were instructed to agree to adjourn the directions
hearing
for seven days, but to require that the amended summons be delivered as soon as
possible that week.  They advised that no
further extensions for delivery of
the amended summons would be afforded.
<P>

5   	It is common ground that on 12 February 1999 the plaintiff
obtained an extension of time within which to file its further amended
summons
to the close of business on that day, which had been agreed to by the
defendants on 8 February 1999.  The foreshadowed further
amended summons was
not filed by 12 February 1999 and the defendants have refused their consent to
any further extension of time
within which that document might be filed.  In
consequence, on 1 March 1999 the notice of motion now before the Court was
filed.
<P>

6   	Mr G F Dowd, a solicitor with the plaintiff's solicitors,
deposed that during the week commencing 5 February the relevant person
at the
plaintiff from whom he required instructions in relation to certain matters was
abroad, and when that person returned to Tokyo,
Mr Dowd ascertained that he
needed to obtain instructions from the former president of the plaintiff in
relation to certain matters
pertaining to the further amended summons.  That
person was no longer employed by the plaintiff and had been retired for some
time,
and Mr Dowd was only able to obtain instructions from the former
president of the plaintiff on 25 February 1999.  He then communicated
instructions to counsel and the notice of motion was filed on 1 March 1999.
<P>

7   	Extensive submissions have been addressed to the Court in
relation to the motion now before the Court.  Those submissions centred
on the
content of a document which became exhibit P1 on the hearing of the motion,
being a further amended summons now sought to
be propounded by the plaintiff.
That summons covers some 82 pages.
<P>

8   	In opposing the making of the orders sought in the notice
of motion, the defendant's counsel has relied upon four particular
complaints.
These are:
<P>

1.  The absence in the pleading to identify properly and distinctly the conduct
of each defendant as referable to liability recoverable
against that
defendant;
<P>

2.  The failure of the document to identify the causal nexus between the
conduct complained of against each defendant and the loss
or damage sought to
be recovered from each defendant.
<P>

3.  The document itself is said to offend in a number of respects which are
said to be not merely pleading points.  Here it is said
that the document fails
to spell out material facts necessary to complete causes of action and to
sustain heads of liability in respect
of which relief is sought. 
<P>

4.  A complaint is made that the amended summons being propounded does not
conform to the reasons of Rolfe J to which I have referred
in certain
respects.
<P>

9   	The amended summons which had been struck out by Rolfe J
included under the heading "Nature of the Dispute" definitions of
"supplying
defendants" and "manufacturing defendants."  Rolfe J had on page 2 of his
Honour's judgment stated that these definitions
in themselves had failed to
illuminate the parties to which reference was being made, save for the first
defendant, because they
had referred "to it and/or its subsidiary or affiliated
companies, including one or more of the defendants."  His Honour had pointed
out that one was "then left, when reading the pleading and seeing either of
those defining words, to speculate as to which of the
defendants reference is
being made."
<P>

10   	The extensively redrafted amended summons now sought to be
propounded by the plaintiff includes a section (III) commencing
at page 13,
which is an entirely new section of the pleading.  It had not previously been
included in the summons struck out.  It
follows section (II) which commences on
page 13 and which in turn deals with the topic "the parties and their
representatives."
<P>

11   	Section (III) in the pleading is in the following terms:

<P>

<i>`III.	<b>The Telectronics group of companies</b></i>
<P>

<i>18.	CMI contends that the first to fifth defendants (inclusive) ("the
Telectronics group of companies") jointly carried on the business
of
manufacturing, packaging and supplying of Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products;  the business being carried on either via
a joint venture, a
partnership, an agency relationship or some other arrangement the details of
which are not know by CMI and are
in the peculiar knowledge of the
defendants.</i>
<P>

<cite>Particulars</cite>
<P>

<i>(a)	The first to fifth defendants (inclusive) all carried on business under
the name "Telectronics Pacing systems";</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The initial approach to CMI was in fact made by Pacific Dunlop which
asked Itochu if CMI was interested in distributing Telectronics
brand heart
pacemaker products in Japan;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Thomas and/or Vale, prior to entry into the Distribution Agreement,
represented to CMI that the business of "Telectronics Pacing
Systems" was
carried on in Australia and the USA by a group of companies named Telectronics
and that the Telectronics companies were
all subsidiaries of Nucleus, which in
turn was the "Medical Division" or "Medical Group" of Pacific Dunlop;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Vale and Thomas purported to and did negotiate the entry into written
agreements on behalf of :</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the second defendant, then known as Telectronics International, in
particular the Cordis Neich Agreement dated 25 October 1991
and subsequent
agreements dated 28 June 1993 and 18 March 1994;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	the first defendant, Telectronics Holdings, in particular the
Distribution Agreement dated 5 December 1991;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Vale was at all relevant times a director and/or senior executive of all
of the first-fifth defendants;</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	At all relevant times, Thomas was the chief executive officer of:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	Telectronics Holdings;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	Medical Telectronics;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	TPLC;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	Nucleus;</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	The written Distribution Agreement dated 5 December 1991;</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	makes reference in the first recital to "subsidiary companies of
Telectronics".</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	refers to heart pacemaker products with "the trade name Telectronics
which are manufactured, sold or distributed by Telectronics,
its subsidiary or
associate or affiliate companies, anywhere in the world . . .".</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	on page 6 makes specific reference to the "Telectronics Group of
companies";</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	The Distribution Agreement dated 5 December 1991 was executed by the
first defendant as agent for all of the companies in the
Telectronics group of
companies;</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	The Distribution Agreement dated 5 December 1991 was ratified by the
subsequent conduct of the second to fifth defendants (inclusive);</i>
<P>

<i>(j)	Invoices received by CMI used the name "Telectronics Pacing
Systems";</i>
<P>

<i>(k)	Promotional material received by CMI used the name "Telectronics Pacing
Systems";</i>
<P>

<i>(l)	The various recall notices/safety alerts which were issued in respect of
Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products were variously
issued by the second
defendant, the third defendant, the fourth defendant and the fifth defendant on
behalf of the Telectronics group
of companies;</i>
<P>

<i>(m)	The recall notices/safety alerts were issued under the name
"Telectronics Pacing Systems";</i>
<P>

<i>(n)	All of the Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products were manufactured
by the fifth defendant (see admission made on behalf
of the defendants by their
solicitors' letter of 29 January 1999) but none of the products were actually
supplied by the fifth defendant
itself;</i>
<P>

<i>(o)	The first defendant, which executed the Distribution Agreement, did not
itself either supply or manufacture Telectronics brand
heart pacemaker
products, which reflects the fact that the supply of the Telectronics brand
heart pacemaker products was a group
enterprise and not an enterprise of the
first defendant solely;</i>
<P>

<i>(p)	Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products which were subject to recall
and surgically removed from patients ("explanted") were
returned by CMI to the
second defendant on behalf of the Telectronics group of companies irrespective
of whether the particular unit
of heart pacemaker product was supplied by the
second defendant, and, further, the second defendant examined each explanted
unit
and returned an advice to CMI in relation to that particular explanted
unit;</i>
<P>

<i>(q)	During the period of the supply of Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products to CMI, communications emanating from the Telectronics
group of
companies were not on the letterhead of the first defendant but were largely on
the letterhead of the second defendant;</i>
<P>

<i>(r)	The first, second and third defendants all carried on business from the
same business premises, being premises from which Nucleus
carried on business
in Australia;</i>
<P>

<i>(s)	The fourth and fifth defendants both carried on business from the same
sets of business premises;</i>
<P>

<i>(t)	From time to time, some of the claims for compensation and rebate made
by CMI in respect of Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products were paid by
the second defendant;</i>
<P>

<i>(u)	the second and third defendants implemented instructions given in the
USA by the FDA to "Telectronics";</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	Statistical failure analyses for all Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products are conducted by the "Returned Product Analysis
Group" on the premises
of fourth defendant;</i>
<P>

<i>(w)	Complaints in respect of Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products
were and continue to be administered by "Clinical Engineering/Product
Performance Groups" on the premises of the fourth and/or fifth
defendants;</i>
<P>

<i>(x)	 By the "Dear Doctor" letter of 23 August 1991, the third defendant gave
undertakings on behalf of the fourth defendant.'</i>
<P>

12   	Mr Walker of counsel, appearing for the defendants,
addressed what I understood to be the principal ground of attack on the
amended
pleading in a number of ways.  The submission refers to paragraph 18 of the
contentions section of the new summons as a "linchpin"
section.  The submission
is that on the basis of the pleading now sought to be propounded, there are no
specifically identified bases
upon which each of the defendants are said to
become liable for conduct of the others in relation to the conduct that is
complained
of.  The submission is that a central problem with paragraph 18 is
that on the one hand, it seeks to group the first five defendants
as a group,
generally referred to on numerous occasions throughout the documents as "the
Telectronics Group of Companies," and on
the other hand, that the allegations
of fact to be found generally referred to from time to time in the pleading,
allege conduct
carried out "on behalf of the group."
<P>

13   	Mr Walker submitted, inter alia, that the pleading walks
between, as I understood him, alleging that the group is a legal
entity itself
and on the other hand, alleging conduct by one or other member of the group or
by one or other defendant said to have
been carried out on behalf of the
group.
<P>

14   	The pleading, it was said, does not identify the actions
on behalf of one defendant for and on behalf of the other defendants
being
complained of.  What was missing, for example, it was suggested, was an
allegation that the second defendant supplied for and
on behalf of the first
defendant, product pursuant to the distribution agreement and that thus the
plaintiff had established liability
against the first defendant by reason of
that agency.  It was necessary, so Mr Walker submitted, to properly spell out
the conduct
of each party and any vicarious responsibility of another party
which likewise, he submitted, required to be set forth.
<P>

15   	Mr Walker's submission was that in essence this is a
product liability case.  The submission was that there was plainly a
contract
being the distribution agreement of 5 December 1991 entered into, so he
submitted, between the plaintiff and the first defendant.
 The submission was
that the plaintiff plainly complains about product supplied pursuant to that
agreement.  The submission was that
it is then open to the plaintiff to sue on
that contract and on the contractual warranties in the document, including any
alleged
fitness for purpose and merchantable quality clauses.  Hence Mr Walker
submitted that there is no good reason for the elaborate device
which the
plaintiff is, so it was submitted, here engaged in, by way of outflanking or
getting around the suggested fact that any
liability, (should there be any
established), in contract, was a liability of the first defendant.
<P>

16   	A short outline of the Group of Companies comprising, on
the plaintiff's allegation, the defendant group, was given in a judgment
delivered by Judge Spiegel in case number 1-CV-95-087-MDL-1057, sitting as the
United States District Court of the Southern District
of Ohio, Western
Division, on February 3 1997.  Those proceedings were brought by recipients of
pacemakers who had claimed that their
pacemakers were defective for various
reasons.  Pages 1 to 7 of that judgment are set out below and were received in
evidence before
me on this notice of motion as background material.
<P>

<i>`This case involves a discussion of the limits of personal jurisdiction over
out-of-state defendants who own corporations that do
business in the forum.
Pacific Dunlop Limited ("PDL") and Nucleus Limited ("Nucleus") (collectively
the "Australian Defendants")
are Australian corporations who have moved to
dismiss this action against them for lack of personal jurisdiction.  PDL is the
beneficial
owner, through Nucleus as the holding company, of TPLC, Inc., the
manufacturer of an allegedly defective pacemaker.  The Australian
Defendants
argue they are not subject to personal jurisdiction because they do not have
sufficient contacts with any forum involved
in this consolidated matter.  The
Australian Defendants further argue that they are only subject to jurisdiction
if they are shown
to be the alter ego of the Telectronics Companies.</i>
<P>

<i>In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part I</a>, the Court will provide some background on this litigation and
generally describe the facts pertinent to the question of personal
jurisdiction.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part II</a> delineates the general rule for the exercise of personal
jurisdiction and Plaintiffs' arguments in favor [sic] of jurisdiction. 
In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part
III</a>, the Court evaluates whether this case presents a situation where it is
appropriate to depart from the traditional forum based minimum
contacts
inquiry.  The Court then determines in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part IV</a> the proper test for personal
jurisdiction in cases where jurisdiction is based upon a parent corporation's
contacts with a subsidiary.
 Finally, in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part V</a>, the Court analyzes whether the
facts here satisfy the test of </i><cite>International Shoe</cite><i> as
applied to the context of the parent-subsidiary relationship.</i>
<P>

<i>I.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	BACKGROUND</i>
<P>

<i>This is a products liability action concerning pacemakers containing the
Accufix Atrial "J" Lead.  A pacemaker is a device that uses
electrical impulses
to reproduce or regulate the rhythms of the heart.  </i><cite>Dorland's
Illustrated Medical Dictionary</cite><i>, (28th ed. 1994).  It is driven by a
battery and connected to the heart by leads and electrodes.
</i><cite>Id.</cite>
<P>

<i>The heart pacing system at issue here consists of three main parts:  a pulse
generator, leads, and a programmer.  Each pacing system
usually contains one or
two leads, which traverse through a person's veins, directly from the pulse
generator to inside the heart.
 The lead utilizes a retention wire to hold the
atrial lead in the "J" shape.  The lead's retention wire is a filament of one
of
two metal alloys, Elgiloy or MP35N.  Telectronics Pacing Systems,
Incorporated, Letter of Duane A. Schultz, Vice President Clinical
and
Regulatory Affairs, Premarket Notification to FDA, December 18, 1989.  Both
Elgiloy and MP35N are nickel-cobalt based alloys.
 </i><cite>Id.</cite>
<P>

<i>The retention wire is not electrically active in the pacing circuit.
Consequently, it has nothing to do with the conduction of the
electrical signal
or the operation of the pacing system.  The retention wire is encased in
polyurethane insulation and bends back
and forth within the system.</i>
<P>

<i>Plaintiffs are recipients of pacemakers containing the "J" lead and their
spouses.  Plaintiffs claim that their pacemakers are defective
because the
retention wires will occasionally break because of the bending and poke through
the polyurethane.  Such a fracture can
cause serious injury to the heart or
blood vessels.</i>
<P>

<i>Plaintiffs, Elise and Eugene Owens, filed and lead action in this case on
February 13, 1995, alleging injury due to a defective "J"
lead.  The Panel on
Multi-District Litigation ("MDL Panel") selected this Court as the transferee
court for all claims involving
the Accufix "J" lead.  Presently, over 400 cases
are pending before this Court for pretrial proceedings.  The Court appointed
Plaintiffs'
Steering Committee ("PSC") to coordinate discovery and other
pretrial proceedings on behalf of Plaintiffs in the cases transferred
to this
Court.  The Court ordered the PSC to file a Master Complaint.  On July 20,
1995, Plaintiffs filed an Amended and Consolidated
Master Class Action
Complaint asserting claims for negligence, strict liability, failure to warn,
breach of warranty, fraud, medical
monitoring and emotional distress.</i>
<P>

<i>B.	JURISDICTIONAL FACTS</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant, TPLC, Inc., ("TPLC") is a Delaware Corporation engaged in the
business of designing, manufacturing, and marketing medical
devices including
the Accufix atrial "J" lead pacemakers at issue in this case.  Defendant,
Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. ("TPSI"),
is a corporation organized under
the laws of the State of Delaware.  TPSI owns 100% of the stock of TPLC.
TPSI's sole business is
to hold certain industrial property rights, real estate
and the equity interest in TPLC.</i>
<P>

<i>Nucleus Limited ("Nucleus") is a corporation organized under the laws of
Australia.  It is a holding company involved in the medical
products industry.
Nucleus owns a group of companies that design, manufacture and sell pacemakers
and defibrillators around the world
under the trade name "Telectronics Pacing
Systems" or "Telectronics" (collectively referred to as the "Telectronics
Companies").
 TPLC and TPSI are the two Telectronics Companies that operate in
the United States.</i>
<P>

<i>Until 1988, Nucleus was a publicly-held Australian company.  In 1988,
Pacific Dunlop Limited ("PDL" or "Pacific Dunlop) purchased
Nucleus and thus
became beneficial owner of TPLC and TPSI.</i>
<P>

<i>Pacific Dunlop is organized under the laws of Victoria, Australia.  It is in
the business of manufacturing, marketing and distributing
industrial and
consumer products on a worldwide basis.  PDL is organized into five core
business areas (automotive, distribution,
consumer products, building and
construction and health care) consisting of over 225 separate corporate
affiliates and subsidiaries
with annual sales worldwide of approximately $5.5
billion.</i>
<P>

<i>Pacific Dunlop is a publicly held corporation.  Its shares trade on the
NASDAQ.  It maintains bank accounts in the United States--New
York.  Pacific
Dunlop also files reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
as the law requires of publicly traded
companies.  Four divisions of Pacific
Dunlop conduct business in the United States, but none of which conducts
business in Ohio.
 The four divisions have total sales in the United States of
$1.1 million, none of which is in Ohio.</i>
<P>

<i>Nucleus, TPSI and TPLC are all subsidiaries in Pacific Dunlop's health care
business.  These three Defendants plus the other Telectronics
Companies and
other Nucleus' owned medical companies make up the "Nucleus Group" which is the
medical products group of the Pacific
Dunlop Family.  The companies of the
Nucleus Group are all separately incorporated but operate as part of a
"functional organization."</i>
<P>

<i>Pacific Dunlop Holding Co. USA (PDH), a United States holding company which
directly owns most of TPLC through TPSI, requires any
subsidiary in which it
owns 80% or more of the stock to file a consolidated United States income tax
return.  This allows for the
offset of operating losses with operating profits
of the various corporations.  PDL's and Nucleus' performance results, however,
are not included in this consolidated return.</i>
<P>

<i>The Telectronics Companies and other companies of the Nucleus Group
"functionally cooperate" through an entity called the Nucleus
Management Board
("NMB").  The NMB is an oversight committee made up of officers and directors
of Nucleus and PDL.  William Thomas,
as Nucleus' Chief Executive Officer
("CEO"), designates the members of the NMB which includes Nucleus' Chief
Financial Officer ("CFO"),
PDL's managing director, and PDL's CFO.  The NMB
meets monthly and reviews the financial and management reports provided by
TPLC's
officers.</i>
<P>

<i>PDL is involved in establishing the budget for the companies of the Nucleus
Group from the early stages of budget formulation through
final approval.
TPLC's annual budget is consolidated with the budgets of the other Telectronics
Companies.  Happ Aff.   This consolidated
budget is submitted to Nucleus, which
prepares a further consolidated budget for the Nucleus Group.  The budget of
the Nucleus Group
is then transmitted to PDL for approval and reporting
purposes.  </i><cite>Id</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>PDL and Nucleus are also involved in the approval of TPLC's capital
expenditures.  TPLC must submit for approval any capital expenditure
for more
than $100,000 to Nucleus.  All expenditures between $100,000 and $500,000 must
be submitted to the Nucleus Management Board.
 The PDL's managing director
reviews and approves capital expenditures greater than $500,000 but less than
$2 million.  The Board
of Pacific Dunlop reviews and approves any capital
expenditure over $2 million.</i>
<P>

<i>PDL provides financial services to its subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries may
borrow from or invest money with PDL (at all market rates)
but are not required
to do so.  PDL is also involved in the risk management activities of its
subsidiaries.  PDL manages and coordinates
risk by arranging for insurance
coverage for itself and its subsidiaries.</i>
<P>

<i>Finally, PDL has on a few occasions agreed to indemnify TPLC suppliers.  It
claims to have done this only on two occasions when the
supplier refused to do
business with TPLC without the agreement from PDL.  PDL felt this was the only
way to protect its investment
in TPLC by insuring that TPLC had supplies to
carry on its business.'</i>
<P>

17   	The plaintiff pleads, as has already been seen, that the
first five defendants jointly carried on the business of manufacturing,
packaging and supplying of Telectronic brand heart pacemaker products, that
business being carried on either through a joint venture
or a partnership or an
agency relationship or some other arrangement, details of which are in the
pleadings said to not be presently
known to the plaintiff.
<P>

18   	The pleading alleges a number of specific allegations with
respect to the place within the group of the respective defendants.
 Hence
paragraph 16 pleads that the seventh defendant at all material times engaged in
the business of manufacturing, marketing and
distributing industrial and
consumer products in Australia and worldwide.  Particular 8 to paragraph 18
pleads that the first to
fifth defendants all carried on business under the
name "Telectronics Pacing Systems."  Particular (g)(ii) to paragraph 18 pleads
that the written distribution agreement entered into between the plaintiff and
the first defendant (alleged to have been entered
into by the first defendant
as agent for all of the companies in the Telectronics Group of Companies),
referred to heart pacemaker
products with "the tradename Telectronics which are
manufactured, sold or distributed by Telectronics, its subsidiary or associate
or affiliate companies anywhere in the world."
<P>

19   	Particular (r) to paragraph 18 pleads that the first,
second, third and sixth defendants all carried on business from the
same
business premises.  Particular 18(s) pleads that the fourth and fifth
defendants carried on business from the same sets of business
premises.
<P>

20   	Particular (o) to paragraph 18, pleads that the first
defendant did not itself supply or manufacture Telectronics brand heart
pacemaker products, which it is said "reflects the fact that the supply of such
products was a group enterprise and not an enterprise
by the first defendant
solely."
<P>

21   	The case clearly throws up the question of a plaintiff's
entitlement to pierce the corporate veil.  In <i>Briggs v James Hardie and
Co</i> (1989) 16 NSWLR page 549, Rogers AJA at page 567 referred to the
threshold problem which arises "from the fact that there is no common
unifying
principle, which underlies the occasional decision of courts to pierce the
corporate veil."  His Honour went on to say "although
an ad hoc explanation may
be offered by a court which so decides, there is no principled approach to be
derived from the authorities...in
the result, it is a matter of extreme
difficulty to say whether the evidence adduced meets even the less than
exacting requirements
of the section (referring to section 58 of the
Limitations Act 1969 there under consideration).
<P>

22   	Rogers AJA examined a number of authorities dealing with
attempts to pierce the corporate veil.  I do not intend to here set
out the
whole of his Honour's observations in relation to those authorities.  Suffice
it to say that his Honour referred, inter alia,
to<i> Smith, Stone and Knight
Limited v Birmingham Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%204%20All%20ER%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 4 All ER 116</a>, where the profits of
a subsidiary were treated a profits of the holding company which had appointed
the persons who had conducted
the business and were in effectual and constant
control.  Atkinson J had in that case at page 120 said,
<P>

<i>"It is also well settled that there may be such an arrangement between the
shareholders and a company as will constitute the company,
the shareholders'
agent, for the purpose of carrying on the business and make the business the
business of the shareholders."</i>
<P>

23   	Atkinson J had cited from the judgment of Cozens-Hardy MR
in <i>Gramophone and Typewriter Limited v Stanley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%202%20KB%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 2 KB 89</a> pages
95-96.  In that passage the Master of the Rolls had said, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`The fact that an individual by himself or his nominees holds practically
all the shares in a company may give him the control of
the company in the
sense that it may enable him by exercising his voting powers to turn out the
directors and to enforce his own
views as to policy, but it does not in any way
diminish the rights or powers of the directors, or make the property or assets
of
the company his, as distinct from the corporation's.  Nor does it make any
difference if he acquires not practically the whole, but
absolutely the whole,
of the shares.  The business of the company does not thereby become his
business.  He is still entitled to
receive dividends on his shares, but no
more.  I do not doubt that a person in that position may cause such an
arrangement to be
entered into between himself and the company as will suffice
to constitute the company his agent for the purpose of carrying on the
business, and thereupon the business will become, for all taxing purposes, his
business.  Whether this consequence follows is in
each case a matter of fact.
In the present case I am unable to discover anything in addition to the holding
of the shares which in
any way supports this conclusion.'</i>
<P>

24   	Atkinson J had extracted a number of points which he
deemed relevant for determination of the question as to who was really
carrying
on the business, and these included whether the persons conducting the business
were appointed by the parent; whether the
parent was the hidden brain of the
trading venture, whether the parent governed the adventure and decided what
should be done and
whether the parent was in effectual and constant control.
<P>

25   	Ford's Principles of Corporation Law at paragraph 4.400
expresses the view that in Australia "it is still impossible to discern
any
broad principle of company law indicating the circumstances in which a court
should lift the corporate veil."  Agency or partnership,
implied or imputed, is
dealt with in paragraph 4.370 of Ford.  Ford expresses the following view:
<P>

<i>"But where a parent company withholds from the subsidiary company the normal
consequences of being a separate legal entity, there
is a possibility that the
courts will identify it with the controller.  This may happen where a parent
company forms or requires
a subsidiary ostensibly to do something for which the
subsidiary needs a minimum level of resources, but the parent does not give
it
adequate proprietors, capital or loan money, or equip it to run its own
business by loan of personnel or other resources, or give
it a reasonable
chance of independently obtaining credit or resources from third persons.  In
such a case a court may hold that the
dominated subsidiary is an agent of the
parent or a partner with it."</i>
<P>

26   	Several English cases are then cited which are said to
illustrate that approach.
<P>

27   	It is particularly important, it seems to me, to recall
that the present application is essentially an application for an
extension of
the time, which Rolfe J granted in which the plaintiff would be entitled to
re-plead.  True it is that as at the present
moment there is no leave granted
to file an amended summons, and in form it may be appropriate to suggest that
the plaintiff is presently
engaged in an exercise of simply seeking leave to
amend.  However, to my mind, it is fair to describe the plaintiff's application
as in effect a combination of an application for an extension of time in which
to file an amended summons, and an application for
leave to appropriately
amend.
<P>

28   	In <i>Briggs v James Hardie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 549</a> at
544, Hope JA, albeit in referring to the tortious base, pointed out that where
a plaintiff brought an action against two defendants
alleging that one or both
were liable, and there was some evidence to connect each defendant with the
events the subject of the action,
then provided the plaintiff established a
prima facie case against of the defendants, the other defendant would not be
dismissed
from the action until the whole of the evidence had been heard.  As
it seemed to his Honour, "this means that a plaintiff is entitled
to bring an
action against two defendants if he has evidence to establish a prima facie
case against one of the defendants and also
has evidence pointing to the
possibility of the other defendant being liable."
<P>

29   	To my mind, it is particularly important to treat the
subject notice of motion as dealing with a pleading point or matter
going to
pleadings.  This is not an occasion in which evidence of the underlying facts
is appropriate to be examined or to be examined
in any real detail.  The
question is quite simply whether or not the pleading in the form now sought to
be propounded offends against
the necessary requirements for a pleading before
the Commercial list [previously called the Commercial Division].  The pleading
must
provide, as Justice Rolfe pointed out at page 7 of his Honour's judgement,
a sufficient statement of the case which is made against
the defendant.  The
plaintiff must plead allegations which have a sufficient degree of specificity
to enable the defendants to know
precisely what case it is that is being made
against those defendants.  Practice note 100, paragraph 6 (ii) states that the
plaintiff's
contentions should (a) avoid formality, (b) state the facts on
which the plaintiff relies together with adequate particulars, and
(c) identify
the legal grounds for the relief claimed.
<P>

30   	To my mind and subject to the particular matters to be
referred to hereafter, the amended summons now sought to be propounded
does
specify and does specify with sufficient particularity, what the plaintiff's
case is against the respective defendants.  This
is not to suggest for a moment
that the plaintiff's pleading seeking in a number of ways to fix the first five
defendants and in
other ways to fix the sixth and seventh defendants with
liability for relevant conduct, is a simple pleading.
<P>

31   	In so far as the defendants have complained that the
plaintiff's allegation that the first to fifth defendants defined as
"the
Telectronics Group of Companies" had jointly carried on the particular business
of manufacturing, packaging and supplying Telectronics
brand heart pacemaker
products, and had carried out that business via a joint venture, a partnership
or an agency relationship, to
my mind the pleading does not offend the above
principles.  As I understood Mr Walker, he accepted in argument that the
defendants
do not submit that it is conceptually a legal impossibility to find
a group of companies who jointly carry on a particular business
and who, as I
understood his concession, from time to time, by any of those companies, might
act on behalf of the others.
<P>

32   	The plaintiff asserts that the first defendant did not
itself supply or manufacture Telectronic brand heart pacemaker products
and
that, as I understand the pleading, this evidences the fact that the supply of
such products was a "group enterprise" and not
an enterprise by the first
defendant solely.
<P>

33   	Having closely examined each of the particulars to
paragraph 18 of the pleading, to my mind the plaintiff clearly pleads with
sufficient particularity to satisfy the requirement that the defendants know
the case sought to be made against them, how it is that
the defendants are
drawn into the proceedings and into each of the causes of action specifically
relied upon.  In this regard I note
that paragraph 21 and following contains
alternative modes of putting the plaintiff's case against the second to seventh
defendants.
 These are paragraphs which commence from the platform that the
plaintiff would fail in its contention in paragraph 18 that the first
to fifth
defendants jointly carried on the business of manufacturing, packaging and
supplying Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products.
<P>

34   	The proper approach to the notice of motion in my view, is
to treat the motion by applying the same principles as would be
applied had the
summons now sought to be propounded, been filed and had the defendants in fact
sought to strike that summons out.
<P>

35   	Returning to the four complaints of the plaintiff, I have
dealt I believe with the submission that the new summons does not
comply with
so much of Rolfe J's reasons as are set out on page 2.9 of his Honour's
judgment - the so-called linchpin issue.  To
my mind, the pleading now sought
to be propounded addresses in an entirely detailed and ultimately acceptable
fashion the manner
in which the several defendants are sought to be pursued.
The complaint dealt with at page 2.9 in Rolfe J's reasons has, to my mind,
been
satisfied by the extensive additional material to be found in the summons now
sought to be propounded.
<P>

36   	In so far as Rolfe J on page 4 of his judgment had
referred to the need for specification with respect to the representation
case,
to my mind paragraph 24 of the pleading now sought to be propounded, in
furnishing particulars there to be found satisfies
the requirement of
specificity.
<P>

37   	It is appropriate to then travel through the whole of the
propounded pleading and to identify those areas in respect of which
the
defendants pursued complaints and to deal with them seriatim.
<P>

38   	The linchpin paragraph and section have already been dealt
with.  However, I accept the defendant's submission that particular
(c) to
paragraph 18 ought to be substantively pleaded - to my mind, as long as that
paragraph is pleaded as an independent paragraph
in the pleading and presumably
to be pleaded prior to paragraph 18, the fact that subparagraph (c) to
paragraph 18 remains as a particular
to that paragraph, does not raise any
particular difficulty.  The particular purpose in pleading paragraph 18(c) in
substance in
an independent paragraph and not simply as a matter of
particulars, it has been suggested, will permit the defendants then to join
appropriate issue.  Whilst that exercise may not be a matter of grave
significance in relation to the pleading, the point having
been made by Mr
Walker, the short minutes to be brought in after the delivery of this judgment
should include provision for that
subparagraph to be independently pleaded in
the fashion to which I have referred.
<P>

39   	In so far as paragraph 25 is concerned, Mr Walker
addressed submissions in relation to the use of the word "impliedly."  The
submission was that the defendants did not know the facts, matters and
circumstances from which the alleged implication was said
to arise.  A similar
complaint, as I understood his submissions, was directed to the use of the word
`impliedly' which appears in
paragraph 30.
<P>

40   	To my mind, those submissions are not of substance in this
sense.  To my mind, the words "by the representation," being the
first three
words in paragraph 25, are to be read and are only to be read, as referable to
the representations pleaded in paragraph
24.  To my mind, the words "by the
representation" appearing as the first three words to paragraph 30, are to be
read and are only
to be read, as referable to the representation which is
pleaded in paragraph 29.
<P>

41   	The representation pleaded in paragraph 24 is one in
respect of which detailed particulars are furnished.  Apparently the
allegation
is that the representations were made orally.
<P>

42   	The representation pleaded in paragraph 29 is a
representation by the submission by the Telectronics Group of Companies to
CMI
of a draft distribution agreement.  Those words are to be read in terms of the
proper construction of paragraphs 29 and 30 as
referable only to the
communication of that document by the Telectronics group to CMI.  In other
words, should the plaintiff in due
course seek to call evidence to the effect
that at one and the same moment as the handing over by the Telectronics group
to CMI of
the draft distribution agreement, certain matters are stated which
are relied upon as part and parcel of the so-called "submission,"
the trial
judge in presumably being referred back to this judgment, will appreciate that
the parties have been required as part of
the leave to be granted today to the
propounding of the amended pleading, to confine the plaintiff to the
representation in terms
of a simple communication by way of delivery or
facsimile or letter, of the document from the one company to the other
company.
<P>

43   	It does not seem to me appropriate in a judgment of the
type presently being delivered to set out large segments of the pleading
now
sought to be propounded, nor indeed to refer with particular specificity to
very many segments of that document.  The document
before the Court requires to
be read in full.  It is divided, in so far as the plaintiff's contentions are
concerned, into nine segments.
 They are conveniently summarised by subheads
and appear in paragraph 1 on page 9.  The most convenient mode of proceeding
seems
to me to simply travel through the document, pausing from time to time at
segments where Mr Walker for the defendants has addressed
particular attention
and to endeavour to deal with those submissions.  Not every particular matter
raised by Mr Walker will be dealt
with.  Those submissions which were put with
respect to the suggested deficiencies in the pleading are generally taken into
account,
but there were numerous attacks on many segments of the pleading,
often overlapping and in some cases discrete, which the Court has
had to take
into consideration in giving these reasons.
<P>

44   	The definitional section from pages 9 to 13 requires no
particular attention.
<P>

45   	The section dealt with under the head "Parties and their
Representatives" is reasonably short.  It is convenient to at this
point in
time note that a close examination of the pleading records the specific
allegations, as I have understood them, with respect
to shareholding to be as
follows.  The seventh defendant owned, it is alleged, 72.7 per cent of the
shares in the first defendant
and owned all of the shareholding in the sixth
defendant.  The sixth defendant, it is alleged, owned 27.3 per cent in the
first defendant.
 The sixth defendant, it is alleged, owned 100 per cent of the
shareholding in the second defendant.  The first defendant, it is
alleged, held
100 per cent of the shareholding in the third defendant.  The fourth defendant,
it is alleged, held 100 per cent of
the shareholding in the fifth defendant.
<P>

46   	The judgment of Judge Spiegel already referred to at page
4 in relation to the fourth and fifth defendants stated, inter alia,
as
follows:
<P>

<i>"TPLC and TPSI are the two Telectronics companies that operate in the United
States."</i>
<P>

47   	In the following paragraph, Judge Spiegel said:
<P>

<i>"Until 1988, Nucleus was a publicly held Australian company.  In 1988,
Pacific Dunlop Limited...purchased Nucleus and </i><cite>thus became beneficial
owner of TPLC and TPSI.</cite><i>"</i>
<P>

48   	An important allegation is to be found in paragraph 184
which pleads that `the first to fifth defendants inclusive as companies
of the
Nucleus group were affiliated through an entity called the Nucleus Management
Board'.  Paragraph 185 then pleads that `at
all material times the Nucleus
Management Board was an oversight committee constituted by officers and
directors of Nucleus and Pacific
Dunlop including Pacific Dunlop's managing
director, Philip Brass, and Pacific Dunlop's chief financial officer'.  The
following
paragraphs refer to the activities of the Nucleus Management Board
and to Mr Thomas, alleged to have been the chairman of the board
of Nucleus and
the chief executive officer of Nucleus.  The pleading in paragraphs 188 to 191
continues:
<P>

<i>"188.  Nucleus owns a group of companies that design, manufacture and sell
pacemakers and defibrillators in a number of countries
under the tradename
`Telectronics Pacing Systems' or "Telectronics".  </i>
<P>

<i>189.  Nucleus is the "Medical Products Group" of Pacific Dunlop.  </i>
<P>

<i>190.  Pacific Dunlop acquired Nucleus in 1988 and thus became beneficial
owner of all of the other defendants.  191.  At all material
times, Nucleus
exercised significant control over the first to fifth defendants
inclusive."</i>
<P>

49   	Relevant to one of the matters raised by Mr Walker which
concerned, so it was suggested, the lack of necessary precision in
the document
in terms of the mode in which the plaintiffs asserted the sixth and seventh
defendants to be appropriately joined and
pursued alleged causes of action
against the sixth and seven defendants, are the references to Nucleus and to
Pacific Dunlop to be
found within part II of the pleading.  In paragraph 13
there is pleaded the allegation that `Nucleus is the holding company of the
first to fifth defendants inclusive', and in paragraph 16 there is pleaded the
allegation that `Pacific Dunlop at all material times
engaged in the business
of manufacturing, marketing and distributing industrial and consumer products
in Australia and world wide'.
<P>

50   		I have already treated with paragraph 18.  The section of
paragraph 18 which to my mind is objectionable and ought not be
permitted to be
propounded in the amended pleading, comprises the words in the third and fourth
lines "or some other arrangement,
the details of which are not known by CMI."
To my mind, those words are inappropriate in a pleading such as this.  They are
not precise.
 They do not appropriately inform the defendants of precisely what
it is that the plaintiffs are seeking to posit as their case.
 When the short
minutes of order giving effect to these reasons are brought in, they should
reflect the fact that those words will
not be presently permitted to be
propounded in this document.
<P>

51   	The particulars to paragraph 18 have already been referred
to.  Subparagraph (n) was the subject of some particular submissions
by Mr
Walker.  The submission was that there was an inconsistency or an arguable
inconsistency between this subparagraph and other
paragraphs in the pleading
which allege that other defendants manufactured Telectronics brand heart
pacemaker products.  During the
course of argument, Mr Foster, SC, conceded
that what was intended to be put by particular (n) was simply that the actual
products
were manufactured by the fifth defendant physically, but it was said
were so manufactured on behalf of the several defendants from
time to time
referred to in the pleading.  That particular reading of subparagraph (n) is
the reading which pursuant to that concession
is to be given to the
subparagraph.  To my mind, it is appropriate for a further sentence to be added
to (n) when the pleading is
filed so that there can in future be no doubt about
that particular matter.
<P>

52   	Subparagraph (o) of the particulars plainly alleges that
the first defendant, which executed the distribution agreement, did
not itself
either supply or manufacture Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products which,
it is said in this particular, `reflects
the fact that the supply of the
Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products was a group enterprise and not an
enterprise of the first
defendant solely'.  I have already dealt generally with
the submissions put by Mr Walker which were to the impropriety, as it were,
of
the inclusion throughout the pleading in so many places of the words "the
Telectronics Group of Companies" as having engaged in
particular conduct or
breached particular terms of agreement and the like.  The allegation that the
supply of the products was a
group enterprise and not an enterprise of the
first defendant solely was plainly relevant to an understanding of the way in
which,
as I have understood this pleading, the plaintiff is putting its case,
at least at one level.
<P>

53   	In so far as Mr Walker's submissions then dealt with the
assertion that the pleading falls short in failing to identify properly
and
distinctly the conduct of each defendant as referable to liability recoverable
against that defendant, and fails to identify
the causal nexus between the
conduct complained of against each defendant and the loss or damage sought to
be recovered from each
defendant, those submissions are rejected.  To my mind,
in a case such as the present in which the plaintiff in a number of ways
seeks
to assert a responsibility of the first to fifth defendants inclusive, called
the Telectronics Group of Companies, on various
causes of action, the pleading
is not one which is inappropriate.  It does sufficiently clearly make plain to
the defendants what
the nature of the case to be made against them is.
<P>

54   	Ultimately it must always be a question of degree in any
given case, as to whether the plaintiff's contentions fall short
of giving the
facts on which the plaintiff relies together with adequate particulars, and
identifying the legal grounds for relief
claimed, in which case an amendment
ought be disallowed, or if the pleading had been filed, the relevant paragraphs
struck out. 
In contradistinction to that is the situation in which the
plaintiff can be seen to give the best particulars which the plaintiff
is then
able to give with respect to those matters.  To my mind, in this type of case
where the corporate veil is sought to be pierced
and/or the plaintiff seeks by
one of a number of means to fix liability in the relevant defendants for acts
of one another or of
a group, the defendants retain an entitlement through
other interlocutory steps and particularly following discovery, to revisit
as
it were, those matters or a number of those matters which Mr Walker on the
motion before me had sought to agitate.  In other words,
to my mind, there may
well come a time prior to the hearing in these proceedings where the defendant
may be able to persuade the
Court on an appropriate application, that more
detailed particulars in terms of specificity of pleading have become
appropriate.
 This is not to say that such an application if pursued will
necessarily be successful.  It is merely to point up that, to my mind,
there
are certain types of class of case and this, it seems to me, may well be one,
when the degree of specificity of particulars
furnished in a pleading may at
one stage be sufficient and at another stage prove insufficient.
<P>

55   	I have already dealt with paragraphs 24, 25, 29 and 30.
<P>

56   	Paragraph 32 importantly pleads that the distribution
agreement was executed by Mr Thomas on behalf of the first defendant
"which in
turn entered into the distribution agreement on behalf of the Telectronics
Group of Companies."  The particulars to that
paragraph include a particular
that at all material times Telectronics Holdings carried on business as part of
a group of companies
comprising it and the second to seventh defendants which
group, it is said, was and is ultimately controlled by the seventh defendant.
Hence at that point in the pleading one finds the seventh defendant and its
role referred to in a significant fashion.
<P>

57   	Paragraphs 34 and following represent significant segments
of the pleading.  It is in these paragraphs that I read what are
said to have
been the obligations imposed by the distribution agreement.  Later in the
pleading, when one finds for example on page
46 Section (vi) paragraph 1 and
following, allegations of breaches of the distribution agreement, it is my
understanding that the
allegations of breach are to be read as allegations of
breach of the terms and conditions of the distribution agreement earlier
referred
to and set out in that earlier section including paragraphs 34 and
following.
<P>

58   	To my mind, the criticisms which were levelled at the
reliance paragraphs, particularly paragraph 40 and following, are without
substance.  I fail to understand why it must be the case that a plaintiff is
disentitled from alleging its reliance upon representations
made, albeit made
prior to execution of a contractual agreement.  I can readily understand
arguments which may be put at the hearing
to the effect that, so it may be put,
precontractual representations merge in the contract.  That is not to say
however that it is
not possible for a plaintiff to make good a case that it
relied upon representations in negotiations which led to an agreement and
so
relied on those representations subsequent to execution of the agreement.  A
great deal depends of course on the particular cause
of action upon which such
a plaintiff would ground his or her case.
<P>

59   	There is then a complaint levelled at paragraph 48 and in
particular at paragraph 48(c) where the words "key types" are used.
 As I read
paragraph 48(c), the word "key" is to be read as synonymous with the word
"particular", which it will be noticed is in
fact the word used in paragraph
48(d).
<P>

60   	Paragraph 48 is an important paragraph in the scheme of
the pleadings.  Following paragraph 48 one has, as I read it, paragraphs
49
through to 87 which are generally the particular pleading of defects relied
upon by the plaintiff.  To my mind, the way in which
the pleading ought be read
is to include as it were particulars to paragraph 48.  In short, a paragraph
entitled Particulars should
be added to paragraph 48 and the content of those
particulars should be referable to paragraphs 49 to 87.  A short statement to
that
effect, it seems to me, ought be included and this will have the effect of
unambiguously confining the plaintiff's allegation in
paragraph 48 to the
particular defects then pleaded in the many pages which follow.
<P>

61   	Further criticism was levelled at the mode of expression
under the column `Defect' which appears on page 29 in table A.  To
my mind, at
this stage in these proceedings, that criticism is not justified and is not of
substance.  I do however accept what I
understood Mr Walker to be putting,
namely that the paragraph in parentheses at the end of the table ought be
deleted.  I can accept
that the defendants ought not be in the invidious
position of having to face a case which is, to use Mr Walker's words I believe,
more appropriately described as a "moving feast".  In short, the defendants
ought know at any particular time through the proceedings
precisely which
products are said to have been defective and for what particular reason.
<P>

62   	Should it be the case that the plaintiff in the fullness
of time determines to endeavour to extend the reach of the pleading
beyond the
products presently complained of, an application will be required to be made by
way of a further amendment.  The alternative
approach is that no doubt the
plaintiff may then see fit to simply start a second set of proceedings
referring to the particular
additional products, and no doubt at some point in
time there may be an application to have those proceedings heard at the same
time
as these proceedings.  Whatever the vehicle be which in the future may,
should the plaintiff be disposed to do so, move the plaintiff
to seek to extend
the reach of the products the subject of this pleading, the defendants are at
all material times clearly entitled
to know precisely which products the
plaintiffs complain of, what those complaints are, and what is the relevant
loss with respect
to the complaints - in short what are the elements of the
respective causes of action.
<P>

63   	I do not accept that there is substance in the submission
that the precise date of identification of defects referred to generally
at the
commencement of each of the following segments, that is, the segments which
follow the table, now require to be specified
in particulars.  The defendants
have an opportunity to, again perhaps following discovery, press for further
and more detailed particulars.
 That may alternatively simply be a matter of
evidence.
<P>

64   	I pass then from those sections of the pleading which
follow the table through to the subheading "Other Defective Telectronics
Brand
Product Types" and paragraph 86.  Paragraph 86 read as follows:
<P>

<i>'86	Other Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products which were not
acquired by CMI for distribution in Japan, but were the subject
of product
recall/safety alerts are as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	implant generator model 5281;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	implant generator model 5282;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	pacing lead model 329-201;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	implant generator model 6291;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	implant generator model 188A7;</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	pacing lead model 329-701;</i>
<P>

<i> (g)	pacing lead model 330-158;</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	pacing lead model 033-448.</i>
<P>

65   	To my mind, paragraph 86 is entirely unacceptable and Mr
Walker's submissions in respect of that paragraph are accepted. 
The paragraph
presently does not seem to me to go to an issue.  I did not understand Mr
Foster, SC, to press paragraph 86 in submissions
when the difficulties which
the Court perceived the plaintiff had with that paragraph were raised.  It may
not be included in the
document which is taken in as propounded.
<P>

66   	There was a degree of attention levelled at paragraph 88.
To my mind, that paragraph is unexceptional, and it and paragraphs
90 and 96,
and in particular 96(b), seem to me to be perfectly acceptable pleaded
paragraphs.
<P>

67   	The causes of action segment in (vi) of the proposed
amended summons commencing on page 46 seem to me to be reasonably clear.
 Care
has been taken to divide the causes of action into the breach of the
distribution agreement section, the negligent misrepresentations
section, the
negligent manufacture and packaging section, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i>
breach section and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soga128/" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Act</a></i> section.  The submission Mr
Walker made that the words "the Telectronics Group of Companies" at the
commencement of paragraph 139
were inappropriate, is rejected.  I have already
sought to deal with the question of the mode in which and particular manner in
which,
the plaintiff seeks to treat with the so-called first to fifth defendant
group of companies.  It is important, it seems to me, to
recognise that against
the background and context of the framework of the pleading, it is entirely
proper for the plaintiffs to plead
- and after all this is simply a pleading -
that that group of companies owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to ensure
that any
representations made as to the Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products were accurate and reliable.  One has to keep in mind steadfastly
that
the pleader has pleaded that the first to fifth defendants, namely the
Telectronics Group of Companies as defined, jointly carried
on the business of
manufacturing, packaging and supplying Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products.
<P>

68   	I interpolate that I did not understand there to be any
issue raised by the defendants, but that the words "joint venture";
"partnership"; and "agency relationship" were clearly understood in terms of
conventional legal principle.  Of course, there are
partnerships and
partnerships.  Of course, there are joint venture and joint ventures.  Of
course, there are agency relationships
and agency relationships.  However, the
purpose of the pleading is to seise the defendants of the way in which the
plaintiff puts
its case against the several defendants, and it seems to me that
using those terms in a case of this type is entirely unexceptional
when the
pleading is viewed in full.
<P>

69   	I do not intend then to go through each of the segments of
the pleading, particularly on and after approximately page 56,
where one finds
the words "Telectronics Group of Companies."
<P>

70   	There was a submission made by Mr Walker, as I understood
him, to the effect that paragraph 146 and following dealing with
breaches of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> failed to include any allegation that what I
understood Mr Walker to say had been an implied representation or implied
representations
were falsified.  I understood Mr Walker in that regard to
particularly refer to paragraph 146(c) and by reference back to paragraph
25.
This is the alleged representation that the Telectronics brand heart pacemaker
products had and would continue to have a good
reputation in the marketplace.
Having read paragraph 147B both subparagraphs (a) and (b), I fail to understand
the complaint in this
regard.  To the extent that the representations are said
to have been continuing representations or representations with respect
to
future matters, paragraph 147B(b) clearly alleges that as to those statements
there was no reasonable basis for making any of
them at the time that each of
them was made, nor did the defendants it is alleged believe that each of them
was accurate at the time
it was made.  In so far as statements of fact are
concerned, they are dealt with in paragraph 147B(a).
<P>

71   	I do accept Mr Walker's criticism of particular (iii) in
paragraph 147B.  The words "in particular" are to be regarded, it
seems to me,
and only regarded, as exhausting the plaintiff's case in this regard.  In
short, Mr Walker's apprehension was that the
plaintiff may rely upon those
words as simply exemplifying and not exhausting the plaintiff's claims.  That
is not the way in which
that subparagraph is to be read.  To my mind, the
plaintiff ought be obliged to delete the words "in particular" so that the
criticism
which Mr Walker it seemed to me fairly levelled at that particular,
will disappear.
<P>

72   	I reject the submission that there is a difficulty with
particular (iv) to paragraph 147B.  To my mind, that criticism is
not made out
as one of substance.
<P>

73   	Criticism was made of the way in which paragraph 149, as I
understood Mr Walker, is pleaded.  The words "the contract" appearing
in the
second line to paragraph 149 do, it seems to me, require appropriately to have
particulars.  I read the words "the contract"
appearing in the second line of
paragraph 149 as referring to the contract alleged in paragraphs 31 and 32 of
the pleadings.  If
I be correct in my understanding of the pleader's intent it
should, it seems to me, be a relatively simple task to add as a particular
to
paragraph 149, words such as `the contract referred to is that pleaded in
paragraph 31 and 32'.
<P>

74   	There were also submissions addressed by Mr Walker to the
categories of loss and damage segment of the pleading.  To my mind,
the
pleading fairly apprises the defendants at this stage in the proceedings of the
heads of category of loss and damage sought to
be relied upon by the plaintiff.
I do not accept the submission that there is no sufficient allegation in the
pleading of the relevant
causal nexus between the loss and damage claimed and
the causes of action in terms of breach of agreement, negligent
misrepresentation,
breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> and other causes of action
relied upon.
<P>

75   	To the extent that Mr Walker submitted that it was
important that the plaintiff make plain, were it the case, that it is entitled
to recover general damages in respect of the damage to its business reputation,
to my mind, that criticism is met by the terms of
paragraphs 173 to 176
inclusive on page 71 of the document, which seem to me to cover that matter.
<P>

76   	With respect to the question of the appropriateness of the
pleading in terms of the joinder of the sixth and seventh defendants,
the sixth
and seventh defendants are generally dealt with in the section of the pleading
entitled VIII which commences on page 72.
 I do not, as I have said, intend to
set out all of those paragraphs, but paragraphs 181 up to and including 211
require careful
reading in that regard.  One finds references to Pacific Dunlop
and to Nucleus scattered throughout the pleadings.  The submission
that the
pleader has not made good in this pleading the proposition that the sixth and
seventh defendants are relevantly liable in
respect to the causes of action
pleaded, is not made out.  The allegation that Pacific Dunlop exercised
significant control over
the first to sixth defendants is to be found, for
example, in paragraph 197.  The allegation that at all material times Pacific
Dunlop
was or is the indirect parent, principal and alter ego of the first to
sixth defendants inclusive is to be found in paragraph 196,
replete with
particulars.  The allegations with respect to Pacific Dunlop directly and/or
through Nucleus, or in the alternative
Nucleus, exercising control, inter alia,
over the activities of some or all of the other defendants are squarely, it
seems to me,
pleaded in paragraph 203.  See also paragraph 211 which reads as
follows:
<P>

<i>"As a result of, inter alia, the common management, officers and board
members, and the central treasury function of Pacific Dunlop,
the significant
exercise of control by Pacific Dunlop and the day to day involvement of Pacific
Dunlop and Nucleus in the other defendants'
affairs, Pacific Dunlop and Nucleus
are both liable to CMI as the alter egos and principals of the other defendants
for the defects
of the Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products and the loss
and damage that CMI has suffered and will continue to suffer as a
result of the
defects of the Telectronics brand heart pacemaker products."</i>
<P>

77   	The pleading includes in relation to paragraphs 214 and
following a number of ways in which the second to fifth defendants
are sought
to be pursued.
<P>

78   	Paragraph 214B, for example, pleads that:
<P>

<i>"The second to fifth defendants were or became parties to the distribution
agreement by reason of their authorisation of the entry
into the distribution
agreement of the first defendant or alternatively, subsequent ratification of
their entering into the distribution
agreement on their behalf."</i>
<P>

79   	Paragraph 214(c) reads:
<P>

<i>"The second to fifth defendants became bound by the distribution agreement
when they, to their knowledge, performed tasks and/or functions
contemplated by
the distribution agreement, namely the manufacture, packaging and supply of
Telectronics brand heart Pacemaker products
to CMI."</i>
<P>

80   	Subparagraph (d) to paragraph 214 reads:
<P>

<i>"And as such it is the second to fifth defendants inclusive which are liable
pursuant to the cause of action set out in section (vi)
above under the heading
"(1) Breach of distribution agreement.""</i>
<P>

81   	To my mind, the pleading does to the extent necessary to
enable the defendants to understand the nature of the case put against
the
defendants, the causes of action and the facts, identify the causal nexus
between the conduct complained of against the defendants
and the loss or damage
sought to be recovered from each defendant.  Many of Mr Walker's submissions
went back to the as it were linchpin
question.  The fact is that the conduct
complained of against the particular defendants are often addressed by
reference to the defendants
as a class.  In other cases, being cases where the
background and context and overview manner in which the plaintiff puts its case
against a group, a pleading may be quite defective for failing to identify such
a causal nexus.  It is however absolutely crystal
clear from the wording of
this pleading in these proceedings, that the first to fifth defendants are sued
as having jointly carried
on the relevant business.  To my mind, the same
degree of precision to the extent necessary to satisfy the rules, and the rules
of
pleading, appear in this pleading in relation to the role of the sixth and
seventh defendants.
<P>

82   	I turn then to the question of limitations.  There is no
real issue, as I have understood it, but that the court has power
pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">part 20</a> of the rules to allow a pleading to be amended.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 1</a>
provides that the Court may at any stage of any proceedings on application by
any party or of its own motion order that any document
in the proceedings be
amended, or that any party have leave to amend any document in the proceedings,
in either case in such manner
as the court thinks fit.  Were it the case that
new causes of action were sought to be added in an amendment, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(5)</a>
provides that:
<P>

<i>"Where a plaintiff, in his statement of claim, makes a claim for relief on a
cause of action arising out of any facts, the court may
order that he have
leave to make an amendment having the effect of adding or substituting a new
cause of action arising out of the
same or substantially the same facts and a
claim for relief on that new cause of action."</i>
<P>

83   	In paragraph 37 of the defendant's submissions, the
defendants asserted that the proposed amendments in respect of causes
of action
founded on:
<P>

(a) breaches of contract as alleged in paragraphs 126, 127, 130(a) and (b),
131(a) and (b);
<P>

(b) the representations referred to in paragraph 135;
<P>

(c) the acts and omissions alleged to be negligent in paragraph 145, are the
subject of expired statutory limitation periods and
ought not be allowed.
<P>

84   	Alternatively, the submission put was that to such extent
as is applicable, the proposed amendments did not fall within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(5)</a>
of the rules.
<P>

85   	Alternatively, it was submitted that if, to the contrary,
it is held that such amendments are within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(5)</a>, injustice to the
defendants occasioned by such amendments inclines against allowance of the same
in exercise of the court's discretionary
power.
<P>

86   	Mr Foster, appearing for the plaintiff, has pointed out
that the causes of action referred to, namely the breaches of contract
paragraphs, the representations paragraph and the acts and omissions alleged to
be negligent paragraph, are all causes of action
which were pursued by the
amended pleading which Justice Rolfe struck out.
<P>

87   	As I have understood both counsel, no submissions were put
to Justice Rolfe on the occasion of the application to strike out
the previous
amended summons to the effect that there were limitation difficulties inherent
in the order which his Honour made, striking
out the then amended summons and
granting leave to the plaintiff to replead by a particular date.  To my mind,
that circumstance
is an important circumstance in considering the manner in
which the undoubted exercise of the court's discretion should here be
exercised.
 In a real sense, the present is a case in which the plaintiff has
simply allowed approximately two weeks to lapse after the time
in which,
pursuant to Justice Rolfe's order, the plaintiff was entitled to replead.  Both
counsel referred to the circumstances in
which the proceedings had commenced in
April 1998.  I understood from Mr Walker that the correspondence had included
references to
the strikeout application for a period of time.  Ultimately, the
exercise of the Court's discretion requires to take into consideration
as a
matter of fundamental fairness on the one hand, prejudice to the defendants if
the amendments are allowed with the effect that
the operation of the rules will
result in the amendments being effective as from commencement of the
proceedings and on the other
hand, prejudice to the plaintiff if the amendments
are not so allowed.
<P>

88   	In all of the circumstances, I am of the view that the
discretion ought be exercised so as to allow the pleading to be filed
as an
amended pleading with the result that the amendments will be deemed to have
been in operation from commencement of proceedings.
 I propose to allow the
plaintiff to amend in that fashion.  Had it been appropriate to treat with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part
20</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 4(5)</a> I would clearly have been of the view that it is appropriate for
the plaintiff to have this leave, as the same facts and claims for
relief
generally appear to me to be sought in the pleading now proposed to be
propounded as had been previously sought to be pleaded,
with one qualification.
The qualification is that without a shadow of a doubt, the pleading now sought
to be propounded includes
a very large number of very detailed particulars, no
doubt a logical concomitant of the previous pleading being struck out.
<P>

89   	To my mind, at the end of the day the plaintiff, subject
to the matters which I have specifically referred to, ought be permitted
to
replead in the form of a document generally in the form of exhibit P1 but
which, when propounded, will require to embrace those
matters which I have
sought to make plain.
<P>

90   	There is one further matter which it is appropriate to
refer to.  As I have understood counsel, although there is no live
notice of
motion in this respect, both parties treated before Justice Rolfe and have
sought to treat before me with an application
understood to be made by the
defendants for further security for costs.  In the result, it was unnecessary
for any argument to take
place on that head as the parties agreed to terms of
the plaintiff furnishing such further security.  The agreement is noted in
short
minutes of order which have been handed to the Court.
<P>

91   	I make orders (1) and (2) in the document which is
entitled Short Minutes of Order, signed by counsel for each of the parties,
which I have initialled and date 19 May 1999, and will leave with the Court
papers.
<P>

COUNSEL ADDRESSED ON COSTS
<P>

Following some argument in relation to costs, both counsel in due course
accepted that it was unnecessary for me to deliver reasons
in respect of the
order which I propose to make and which I understand following argument is not
really the subject of debate, namely
that costs of and occasioned by the notice
of motion be costs in the cause.
