<b>50085/98  -  INCHCAPE FINANCIAL SERVICES (AUST) PTY LIMITED  v  </b>
<P>

<b>CLASSIC AUTOMOBILES PTY LIMITED.</b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:	The plaintiff in these proceedings, Inchcape
Financial Services (Australia) Limited (Inchcape) is a financier.
 As part of
its business it provides finance in relation to the sale of new and used motor
vehicles.  In the course of its business
it enters into terms purchase
agreements, lease agreements, and chattel mortgages with customers in respect
of motor vehicles.  The
first defendant, Classic Automobiles Pty Limited
(Classic) is a licensed motor dealer which (inter alia) trades as Chatswood
Classic
Cars, from premises situated at Chatswood, on the Pacific Highway.  The
second defendant, John Keith Thompson (Mr Thompson) is the
principal executive
and a director of Classic.  Both Classic and Inchcape are companies
incorporated in Australia and are trading
corporations for the purposes of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth) ("the TPA").
<P>

2   	Between late October 1997 and May 1998 Classic forwarded to
Inchcape applications for finance in respect of a number of persons
purportedly
acquiring motor vehicles through Classic.  Inchcape claims, in these
proceedings, that in respect of twenty-one applications,
the information
supplied by Classic was misleading and deceptive, resulting in Inchcape
providing finance in circumstances when it
would have otherwise declined.  It
entered into contracts of terms purchase and chattel mortgage with customers
who failed to honour
those contracts.  In a number of cases the motor vehicles
the subject of the contracts have not been recovered and the customers
cannot
be found.  Inchcape has suffered considerable loss in respect of these
transactions, the details of which will be referred
to later.  It seeks to
recover those losses from Classic.  Its main claim is based upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 52</a> of the
TPA.  It also claims in respect of alleged breaches of relevant terms of an
alleged contract between itself and Classic, described
as an Introducer
Agreement.  In the conduct of the case, this latter claim has assumed only
secondary significance.  Factual issues
relating to it, however, have some
bearing upon the credit of witnesses and it will be necessary for me to
consider this claim later
in these reasons.
<P>

3   	The claim against Mr Thompson is based upon s. 75B of the
TPA.  I shall refer to the nature of the claim later in these reasons.
 
<P>

4   	The hearing of the proceedings occupied twelve days.  A
number of witnesses gave evidence orally and by affidavit.  A large
number of
documents were tendered.  Issues of credit of witnesses assumed considerable
importance as there was very significant conflict
in the oral testimony.  The
demeanour of witnesses in the giving of their evidence was important and,
during the hearing, I formed
fairly distinct impressions as to reliability of
testimony.  Since the hearing terminated I have re-read the whole of the
evidence
and considered it in detail, in light of the demeanour of the
witnesses which was fresh in my recollection.  My impressions have
been
confirmed.
<P>

5   	Before I consider the parties' respective cases, it is
necessary to set out certain uncontentious facts by way of background.
 
<P>

<b>Background</b>
<P>

Inchcape is a company the shares of which are held by Capital Consumer Finance
Limited (Capital) as to 51% and by Inchcape Motors
Australia Limited as to 49%.
Inchcape Motors Australia Limited imports into Australia and distributes motor
vehicles including Volkswagen
motor vehicles.  Capital is also a financier and,
prior to the formation of Inchcape, provided motor vehicle finance to motor
dealerships
including Classic.  When Inchcape commenced operations in January
1997 in New South Wales it took over the role of Capital in providing
finance
to Classic.  Neither Capital nor Inchcape had the major role in providing
finance to Classic.  Neither provided it with floor
plan financing.  It appears
from the evidence that neither financed the sale by Classic of new cars.  Each
had a role in providing
finance for the retail rather than the wholesale
aspects of Classic's operation.  This involved providing finance to approved
customers
of Classic, who were seeking to buy second-hand vehicles.  It is
clear that, throughout 1997 and into 1998, Inchcape was seeking
to increase its
business.  In particular, it was negotiating to obtain the role of wholesale
financier to Classic in respect of Volkswagen
vehicles which Classic sold
through its Volkswagen franchise.  I shall refer to the course of these
negotiations later.  They had
not resulted in any agreement by the time they
came to an end, as a result of the problems with which this litigation is
concerned.
 Witnesses called on behalf of Inchcape included Robert Edward
Foster (Mr Foster) who is the New South Wales/A.C.T. State Manager
for
Inchcape.  Prior to being employed in that position he was Sales Manager for
Capital for a period of twelve months.  He has had
over twelve years experience
in motor vehicle finance, having previously worked in Citibank's Motor Vehicle
Division for six years.
 Although described as the State Manager, the evidence
makes it clear that his role was really that of Sales Manager.  He had two
sales representatives who reported to him, one of whom was Mr Richard Noye (Mr
Noye), another witness in these proceedings.  Each,
as part of their job, made
regular visits to motor vehicle dealerships including Classic.  Mr Foster's
role was to make contact with
senior executives of the motor dealerships, such
as Mr Thompson.  Mr Noye's role was to deal with financial managers in such
organisations,
although, it is clear that Mr Foster also maintained contact
with such executives.  Mr Foster had a key role in negotiations with
Mr
Thompson for the obtaining for Inchcape of the wider floor plan type financing
of Classic's Volkswagen dealership.
<P>

6   	An important witness for Inchcape was Mr Iain Grant (Mr
Grant).  He was the General Manager and a Director of Inchcape.  His
appointment as General Manager commenced on 1 February 1997 and his
directorship in March 1998.  It is clear that he has had extensive
experience
in motor vehicle finance.  He is senior in the organisation to Mr Foster, who
reports to him.  
<P>

7   	Other witnesses for Inchcape included the four underwriters
who dealt with the twenty-one applications which are the subject
of these
proceedings.  They are Messrs Tindall, Corby, Taylor and Neil.  Each gave
evidence orally and by affidavit.  Another witness
was Ms Plumridge.  She was
employed as Team Leader of the Business Service Representatives (the BSRs) and
gave evidence as to the
role of such representatives in relation to Inchcape's
provision of finance to the customers of motor dealerships, including Classic.
Another witness was Ms Clinch who, from March 1997 held the position of Team
Leader in the Settlements Department of Inchcape.  She
gave evidence as to the
role of settlements officers in Inchcape's provision of finance.  From 1
January 1998 she held the position
of Manager of the Settlements Department.
<P>

8   	The evidence of these witnesses established the system
operating in Inchcape in 1997 and 1998 for the receipt and processing
of
applications for financial assistance.  It may be summarised as follows.
<P>

9   	Applications for finance were received by facsimile in the
BSRs section.  In the period November 1997 to May 1998 the section
dealt with
about twenty to thirty applications per day.  The applications were received on
a standard application form provided by
Inchcape to the relevant business
managers at the motor vehicle dealerships with which it dealt.  These forms
provided for the supplying
of information as to the name of the introducer of
the business, a description of the motor vehicle for which finance was being
sought,
the amount of the advance sought together with interest rate and
repayment terms, and details in relation to the proposed borrower.
 With
respect to the vehicle, information was sought as to its make and model, its
year of manufacture, whether it was new or used,
had a manual or automatic
gearbox and whether it had options such as air-conditioning, airbags etc.
Importantly, the name of the
supplier of the vehicle was to be provided.  The
particulars relating to the proposed advance included the amount of a deposit
or
the value of a trade-in.  Particulars in relation to the proposed borrower
included name, address, date of birth, marital status,
number of dependants,
whether a home owner, buyer or renter, or whether living with parents, whether
there was a mortgage over the
home and the like.  Where appropriate, employment
details were required to be given, with contact telephone numbers.  Also,
credit
and bank references were supplied in another part of the form.  It is
clear that these details were commonly filled-in by the business
manager at the
relevant dealership, who was dealing with the proposed borrower.  In addition
to the application form there would
also be forwarded from the dealership a
further Inchcape standard form described as a Privacy Consent Form.  This was
an authority
to Inchcape signed by the applicant borrower to make enquiries and
obtain information from various sources as to the applicant's
financial
position.  
<P>

10   	When these documents were received into the section the
BSRs logged the application details onto a register and set about
obtaining
other information.  This information consisted of a valuation for a vehicle
answering the description in the application.
 This was obtained from a
standard reference work known as Glass's Guide.  A report was also obtained in
respect of the applicant
from the Credit Reference Association of Australia
(CRAA).  A check was made that name, date of birth and address of the applicant
on the application corresponded with the CRAA report.  If this material
appeared satisfactory, it was passed-on to the Underwriting
Department for the
attention of an underwriter.
<P>

11   	An underwriter would then assess the documentation.  The
evidence indicates that approximately 90% of applications were approved
immediately, approval being based upon an assessment by the underwriter of the
financial viability of the application.  If it was
clear that the applicant
would be in a position to service the loan then the application would be
approved subject to conditions
as to the supplying of supporting documentation.
There were standard approval conditions upon an Inchcape form, which also made
provision
for an underwriter adding additional conditions.  An additional
condition sometimes sought was the provision of a Form 4 document
issued by a
dealership, under the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mda1974154/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Dealers Act 1974</a> as prescribed by
cl.16 and Schedule 1 of the Motor Dealers Regulation 1986.  This was a form
attached to a second-hand vehicle in
a dealer's saleyard.  It provided for a
three months' warranty on the vehicle.  It gave details relating to the vehicle
such as make,
model, year of manufacture, kilometres travelled, options, engine
number, chassis number, registration number and asking price. 
It also provided
for the recording of the cash price at which the vehicle was sold and the
kilometres travelled at time of sale.
 Also to be included was the purchaser's
full name and address.  In addition provision was made on the form for the
recording by
the dealer of the date when the notice was affixed to the vehicle.
The form provided for the recording of the book number and entry
number, the
former referring to the book kept by a motor dealer recording the issuing of
the notices, the latter being the serial
number of the notice so recorded.  The
reason for an underwriter seeking the provision of such a notice would be to
confirm that
the vehicle in respect of which the application was made was
correctly described.  Four such notices were called for and provided
in the
present case.  I shall make reference to them later.
<P>

12   	The underwriter, having approved the application, subject
to conditions, would return the file to the BSR section to be further
processed.  The BSRs then considered the underwriter's requirements and,
pursuant to them, would forward an Approval Advice document
to the relevant
dealer.  This document indicated the granting of approval, subject to the
provision of additional information identified
in the document.  The dealer
then complied with the conditions and forwarded the compliance documents to the
BSR dealing with the
matter.  On receipt of this material, the file with the
additional material was sent to a part of the Inchcape organisation referred
to
as the Settlement Unit.
<P>

13   	The procedures in relation to settlement are set-out in
the evidence of Ms Clinch.  Her testimony establishes that the finance
transaction could not be settled unless the documents referred to in the
Approval Advice were supplied.  Additionally, an invoice
from the supplier of
the vehicle was necessary, this being required as an indication that the
correct vehicle was being supplied
pursuant to the contract.  It also
demonstrated the passing of title of the vehicle from the motor dealer to the
finance company
in the case of terms purchase and leasing transactions or to
the borrower where a chattel mortgage was being given by the borrower
to the
finance company.  The invoice further indicated that the dealer giving it was
the owner of the vehicle.  The invoice would
be checked to ensure that the
details contained in it, as to type of car, chassis number, engine number,
registration number and
name of customer corresponded with such details in the
contract.
<P>

14   	Ms Clinch also gave evidence, which I accept, that if the
invoice showed the vehicle was being supplied by someone other than
the
introducing dealer on the application form, enquiries would be made to
ascertain why the vehicle was being supplied by a third
party.  In
circumstances where both the application and the invoice indicated that the
supplier was other than the dealer the settlement
figure would be paid only if
the relevant Settlement Officer verified the transaction with the relevant
underwriter and obtained
authority to settle.  In such cases, the invoice would
have come from the supplier of the vehicle and not the introducing dealer.
 The
supplier would be paid, not the dealer, if the transaction was permitted to
proceed.
<P>

15   	It is now necessary to consider the arrangements within
Classic relating to the obtaining of finance for vehicles from Inchcape
at the
time of the subject applications.  The evidence establishes that Mr Thompson
did not directly concern himself in matters of
financial management.  He
delegated this work to David Kevern (Mr Kevern) who supplied his services
through a company structure,
the company being named Janafe Pty Limited
(Janafe).  He had an assistant, Sharleine Whyte  (Ms Whyte).  Mr Kevern and Ms
Whyte performed
the role of business managers.  They interviewed customers of
the dealership wishing to acquire vehicles; they filled out and faxed
to
Inchcape application forms and Privacy Consent Forms; they forwarded supporting
documentation and complied with the approval conditions
imposed by the Inchcape
underwriters; they obtained the customer's signature to the application forms
and contract documents; they
received and disbursed settlement monies received
from Inchcape.  From time to time, as necessary, they would discuss
transactions
with the relevant BSRs at Inchcape.  They received visits from Mr
Foster and Mr Noye and could discuss transactions with them.  They
could not
discuss transactions with the underwriters at Inchcape.
<P>

16   	I have already indicated that in 1997 and 1998 Inchcape,
through the direct solicitations of Mr Foster was endeavouring to
become the
main supplier of finance, floor plan and retail, to Classic in respect of its
Volkswagen dealership.  The financier which,
then, had that status was
Australian Guarantee Corporation (AGC).  It is clear that, at least until late
October to early November
1997, the bulk of the retail financing required by
Classic's customers was obtained from AGC.  Inchcape received a relatively
small
amount.  The evidence indicates that it could receive retail financing
applications in respect of used cars after some form of monthly
quota to AGC
had been filled.  Also other applications could be referred to it, if Mr Kevern
saw fit.  No significant pattern emerges
from the evidence.  However, from the
beginning of November 1997 there was a considerable increase in the
applications made to Inchcape.
 From November 1997 to May 1998, in excess of
fifty such applications occurred, which, undoubtedly, were markedly more than
had been
received prior to November.  Some of these were declined by the
underwriters as not coming within Inchcape's lending guidelines.
 A large
number were accepted.  Amongst those accepted were the twenty-one in issue in
these proceedings.  
<P>

17   	The flow of applications ceased abruptly when a problem
arose in relation to a transaction described in the evidence as the
"Jimmy Lee
transaction".  This had involved the advance of $180,000 for the terms purchase
of a Mercedes Benz vehicle by Jimmy Lee.
 The repayments contracted for were
$3,200 per month.  No payments other than the initial payment had been made.
The account was
$9,600 in arrears and neither the vehicle nor Jimmy Lee could
be found.  These facts and other facts revealed by investigation of
the problem
brought the course of dealing between Classic and Inchcape to an end.  They
also brought to an end the negotiations,
which were still current, for the
finalisation of floor plan arrangements in respect of the Volkswagen franchise.

<P>

18   	After the Jimmy Lee problem arose, the problems in
relation to the other twenty transactions sued upon also came to light.
 I
shall not refer by name to these transactions as, in my view, they have
sufficient common characteristics to enable their being
treated as a unit.  It
is clearly established that none of the vehicles involved in these transactions
were vehicles sold from Classic's
premises at Chatswood nor from any other
premises owned and controlled by it.  They were never owned by Classic.  They
were owned
by private persons or by one of two dealerships not associated in
any way with Classic.  
<P>

19   	These vehicles had been introduced to Classic by Mr John
Joseph Purchall (Mr Purchall), a finance consultant who traded under
the name
JP Investments.  Mr Purchall had an association with Classic.  He had been a
business manager at a Collaroy dealership owned
by Mr Thompson.  He also acted
from time to time as a business manager at Classic's premises at Chatswood,
apparently filling-in
when Mr Kevern was away.  It is clear that Mr Kevern knew
him well and that Mr Thompson was also acquainted with him.  Apart from
these
occasional part-time activities he conducted a business which he described as
being that of a finance intermediary in the motor
car trade.  It appears that
persons or small dealerships, who had no access to finance for their customers,
would approach him, seeking
his assistance in the obtaining of finance.  It is
clear that a type of transaction known as a "third party deal" was a recognised
feature of motor car selling.  It involved a motor dealer, who had access to a
regular source of finance from a financier, introducing
to that financier a
customer who wished to acquire, or borrow on, a vehicle which was not part of
the dealer's stock.  In such circumstances
the dealer would make an application
in which it was indicated that that finance was sought for the customer but
that the vehicle
was to be supplied by an outside party, commonly, but not
necessarily, another dealer.  If the finance company accepted the transaction
and advanced the amount sought, a third party deal was consummated.
<P>

20   	All the deals brought by Mr Purchall to Mr Kevern, in
which Mr Kevern successfully applied to Inchcape for finance, were third
party
deals, in so far as the vehicles the subject of the transactions were not
supplied by Classic from its own stock but came from
an outside supplier, that
outside supplier being the organisation or person who had approached Mr
Purchall for assistance.  I am
satisfied on the evidence, however, that they
lacked one very significant feature of accepted customary third party
transactions.
 In each case there was no disclosure on the application made by
Mr Kevern or Ms Whyte on behalf of Classic that the supplier of
the vehicle in
question was an outside or third party supplier.  In each case the supplier was
represented as being Classic.  The
description commonly used was "Chatswood
Classic Cars," this being the name under which Classic traded at Chatswood.  I
shall refer
to this group of transactions as "the Purchall transactions."
<P>

21   	Against this background I turn now to consider the
plaintiff's case.
<P>

22   	<b>The Plaintiff's Case</b>
<P>

It is convenient to deal in the first place with the plaintiff's claim pursuant
to s. 52 of the TPA.  It is asserted that Classic,
through Mr Kevern,
relevantly engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by the provision of
applications for finance, which indicated
on their face that the supplier of
the vehicle, in respect of which finance was sought for the customer in
question, was Classic
itself.  Insofar as Classic was not the supplier of the
vehicle in any of the cases in question this was incorrect and relevantly
misleading information.
<P>

23   	It was claimed, through evidence which I accept, that it
was a matter of importance to Inchcape and, indeed, to any financier
to know
that the vehicle in respect of which finance was sought was a vehicle owned by
the dealer seeking finance for its customer.
 It operated as an indication that
the dealer, who had either purchased the vehicle for the purpose of offering it
for sale as a
second-hand vehicle, or who had accepted it as a trade-in, had
undertaken all normal checks in relation to the acquisition of the
vehicle.
These would involve, through examination of the vehicle, the ascertainment of
the correspondence between the details on
the registration papers as to engine
and chassis numbers with the numbers actually displayed on the vehicle and an
enquiry through
the Register of Encumbered Vehicles to ascertain that there was
no money owing on the vehicle to some other person or organisation
(a REVS
check).  Also, a check on the identity of the person supplying the vehicle,
through his motor vehicle licence details and
other evidence.  Also, it could
be assumed that in most cases a statutory declaration would have been obtained
from the person in
question as to his identity and ownership of the vehicle.
Mr Thompson, himself, agreed that a finance company would want to be confident
of these matters.
<P>

24   	The provision, later in the transaction, of an invoice
indicating that Classic was the seller of the vehicle operated as a
document of
title and also as confirmation that the vehicle, having been acquired by
Classic, had been subjected to all the relevant
checks.  Both Mr Thompson and
Mr Kevern agreed that the provision of the invoice was, in effect, a guarantee
of title.
<P>

25   	In all the cases in issue in these proceedings the
application form and the invoice are relied upon as making the misleading
representation that the vehicle came from Classic's own stock and therefore had
attracted the safeguards just discussed.
<P>

26   	It was claimed that the misleading information, thus
conveyed to Inchcape, resulted in Inchcape suffering the damage in respect
of
which it sues.  It was submitted that, having regard to the way in which the
applications were processed at Inchcape from their
receipt by the BSRs, their
assessment and conditional approval by the underwriters and their ultimate
payment after the Settlement
Officers had satisfied themselves that the
underwriter's conditions had been fulfilled and that the invoice in all proper
respects
corresponded with the application, the necessary result was that
Inchcape made its payments in respect of the transactions as a direct
consequence of Classic's misleading conduct.  
<P>

27   	I should add that the payment in question was not only the
payment of the amount of finance required to complete the transaction
but also
a payment of commission to Classic.  The evidence establishes that this
commission was split between Mr Purchall and Classic
in the ratio of 60% to
40%, Classic's 40% then being split 60% to Classic itself and 40% to Janafe.
It is claimed by Inchcape that
the amounts of commission in relation to the
subject transactions were also paid as a result of its being mislead by the
conduct
referred to.
<P>

28   	I am quite satisfied that prima facie, these claims are
made out.  There is evidence given by each of the underwriters who
dealt with
the claims that they were aware that Inchcape had a policy of not engaging in
third party transactions.  I am further
satisfied that had any of these
transactions been identified as third party transactions, the relevant
underwriter would not have
embarked upon an evaluation of the application
without obtaining authorisation to do so.  There is some evidence to indicate
that
such authorisation could have been obtained from Mr Foster.  It could
certainly have been obtained from Mr Grant.  However, on the
evidence, there is
no reason to suppose that, having regard to the policy referred to, such
authorisation would readily have been
given.  Moreover, such authorisation
would, quite clearly, not amount to a direction to approve the transaction.
The power to approve
remained solely the province of the underwriters who, if
authorisation were granted, would proceed to evaluate the application in
the
ordinary way, according to the ordinary guidelines of financial viability.  
<P>

29   	These considerations, however, are really beside the point
in the present case.  Although, as already indicated, the transactions
in
question were, indeed, third party transactions, they were not presented to
Inchcape in this form.  No reference was made in the
application or in the
invoice to the existence of a third party supplier.  This fact was disguised.
Consequently, Inchcape's policy
in relation to third party transactions and its
procedures in relation to them were never engaged.  If they had been presented
as
third party transactions, I entertain no doubt that authorisation to the
underwriters to proceed with their assessment would have
been withheld.  
<P>

30   	There was much consideration in the evidence of the way in
which individual applications were dealt with by the underwriters.
 It is clear
that a number of the transactions in question were not regarded as clear cases
for acceptance.  Some were originally
declined but were resubmitted with
additional information which led to their acceptance.  Some were accepted by an
underwriter after
having been declined previously by another underwriter.
Others succeeded after reference to the Supervising Underwriter, Mr Tindall.
It is clear, also, that a number of the applications emanating from Mr Purchall
were declined.  However, none of the problems associated
with these
applications which caused concern to the underwriters related to their being
third party transactions.  I am satisfied
that, quite apart from the fact that
their true third party nature was disguised, there was nothing in the
transactions themselves
which caused any of the underwriters to believe that
they were in fact dealing with concealed third party transactions.  One of the
underwriters, Mr Taylor, whom I felt to be a rather suggestible witness, tended
to accede to propositions that the type of vehicle,
the high interest rates,
and the areas of residence of the purchasers could be indicative of the
transactions not emanating from
Classic.  However, his evidence in this regard
fell well short of establishing that he regarded the transactions with which he
dealt
as being of a third party nature.  He clearly did not.  Otherwise, he
would have referred them to senior levels in Inchcape.
<P>

31   	I am quite satisfied, therefore, that the misleading
characteristics of the application forms and the invoices, namely their
indication that the vehicles in question were owned and supplied by Classic,
effectively caused Inchcape to finance the Purchall
transactions.  Had the
correct situation been disclosed on the face of this documentation, the
transactions would not have proceeded.
 In these circumstances, it is
unnecessary to consider the detail of the  individual transactions.  
<P>

32   	The misleading nature of Classic's conduct in relation to
these transactions is heavily underlined when consideration is given
to what
was known by Mr Kevern, acting on behalf of Classic, as opposed to what was
revealed to Inchcape.  Mr Kevern, of course,
knew that all the transactions
were third party transactions introduced by Mr Purchall.  It is obvious from
the documents maintained
in the files of Classic in relation to the Purchall
transactions and from the evidence of Mr Kevern and Mr Purchall, that any
documentation
which might have revealed the true position to Inchcape was kept
from it.  The transactions were frequently introduced to Classic
by a fax sent
by Mr Purchall which provided information as to the nature of the transaction.
This documentation or the information
contained in it was not made known to
Inchcape.  The result was that, in respect of some of the transactions,
Inchcape supplied finance
believing the transaction was of a particular type
when, in fact, the money was intended to be used for a different transaction,
the existence of which was not disclosed to Inchcape.  For instance, in the
case of applicant Akkouche, Inchcape advanced money on
the basis that it was
purchasing the relevant motor vehicle from Classic to be provided to Mr
Akkouche under a normal term purchase
agreement.  In fact the vehicle was not
sold by Classic to Inchcape.  It was never owned by Classic.  It was owned by
Mr Akkouche
who was seeking to raise finance on it.  The term purchase
agreement was inappropriate.  Inchcape entered into it as a result of
being
deliberately mislead by Mr Kevern.  A similar situation existed in relation to
a transaction involving an applicant Mr S. Chan.
 
<P>

33   	In addition to the initiating faxed information, Mr
Purchall would forward to Classic registration certificates in relation
to the
vehicles together with notes as to information he had obtained, such as REVS
checks.  The registration certificates would
have indicated that the vehicle in
respect of which finance was being sought was owned by a third party.  This
information was never
supplied to Inchcape.  It was deliberately withheld.  In
relation to Mr Chan's transaction, Mr Kevern gave the following evidence:
<P>

"Q.  You didn't send them Mr Purchall's fax of 8 January or a copy of the
certificate of registration with the note "No revs check",
because if you had
done so, it would have been obvious that this was a third party deal, isn't
that right?
<P>

  A.  Well, they would ask why we had a registration paper in the name of Chan
there."
<P>

34   	The conduct of Mr Kevern in relation to the supplying of
Form 4s when requested by an Inchcape underwriter as a condition
of approval
was also deceptive.  There were four such cases.  It is not necessary to refer
to them in detail.  The same deception
was practised in each case.  Mr Purchall
either supplied information to Classic which would be provided in a regular
Form 4 or forwarded,
in circumstances where the vehicle was being supplied by a
dealer, the Form 4 which had actually been placed on the vehicle in that
dealer's yard.  The real Form 4 could not be supplied to Inchcape as it would
reveal the third party nature of the transaction. 
Instead, Mr Kevern, or Ms
Whyte at his direction, produced a Form 4 purporting to issue from Classic.  It
contained all the information
to which reference has already been made and
which would be expected to appear upon a Form 4 legitimately attached to a
vehicle offered
for sale in Classic's own saleyard.  It appears from the
evidence that Mr Kevern and Ms Whyte maintained a number of blank forms
in the
desk in Mr Kevern's office which were to be used for this purpose.  They
contained a false reference to the book number and
entry number referred to
above.  These pieces of information gave the document apparent authenticity.
The document, when forwarded
to Inchcape, provided information as to the
identity of the vehicle through registration number, engine number and the
like.  This
information was being sought by the Inchcape underwriter.  However,
the provision of it in the body of a bogus Form 4 concealed the
fact that the
true Form 4 would have revealed, namely that the vehicle was not owned by
Classic but by a third party.  I am satisfied
that the provision of such
documents was part of a plan to conceal from those making the relevant
financing decisions in Inchcape
the true nature of the transaction for which
finance was being sought.  Also, I have no difficulty in inferring that this
concealment
was occasioned by an awareness on the part of both Mr Kevern and Mr
Purchall that if the true nature of the transaction had been
disclosed finance
would not be forthcoming.  Indeed, Mr Purchall, in his evidence, readily
conceded that these documents were supplied
instead of the legitimate ones in
order to prevent Inchcape knowing the true position.
<P>

35   	I should add that both Mr Purchall and Mr Kevern had
significant motivation for misrepresenting the position to Inchcape in
order to
achieve the financing of the transactions.  The commissions which were paid to
Classic in the first instance were of not
inconsiderable size.  Mr Purchall
received 60% of them and the percentage received by Mr Kevern would have
provided incentive to
him to deceive Inchcape into supplying the finance and
paying the commissions.  In fact, in respect of only four transactions Mr
Purchall received commission payments totalling $24,000.
<P>

36   	Notwithstanding the apparent strength of this case,
Classic has sought to defend it in a variety of ways.  It has asserted
that
Inchcape was not misled because it was aware of the relevant facts.  As I
understand it, it was but faintly suggested that persons
other than Messrs
Foster and Noye in Inchcape were aware of the true position.  In my view there
is no evidence to support this assertion.
 I reject it.  It is claimed,
however, that Mr Foster and Mr Noye were fully aware of what was going on and
had even directed that
the deception be practised in the way that it was.  Upon
this factual foundation defences such as acquiescence and estoppel are sought
to be raised together with an assertion that knowledge on the part of those two
employees must be regarded as, in law, the knowledge
of Inchcape.  As part of
this case, the credit of Mr Foster was severely attacked.  Included in this
attack was an allegation that
he had deliberately manufactured evidence
relating to the alleged execution by Mr Thompson and his wife, on behalf of
Classic, of
an Inchcape Introducer Agreement in January 1997.  In these
circumstances, it is convenient to consider together the question of
the
Introducer Agreement and the Classic defences. 
<P>

37   	<b>The Introducer Agreement and Classic's defences to
Inchcape's claim</b>
<P>

Prior to the formation of Inchcape, Capital had provided finance to Classic in
relation to business which had not been given to
AGC.  It was provided pursuant
to a document described as an Introducer Agreement between the two companies,
the document being dated
25 August 1996.  As already indicated, Inchcape, after
its formation, took over this aspect of Capital's business.  It is claimed
that
in February 1997 an agreement in the same terms, with the substitution of
Inchcape for Capital, was executed by Classic, the
signatories being Mr and Mrs
Thompson.  On behalf of Inchcape, reliance is placed upon the evidence of Mr
Foster as to the execution
of the document.  Its execution is denied by Mr and
Mrs Thompson.  Mr Foster has testified that he delivered the document, after
its execution, to a Mr Rowland, an officer of Inchcape charged with the
responsibility for the keeping of such documents.  He has
not seen it since.
It cannot be found.  
<P>

38   	Mr and Mrs Thompson deny the execution of the agreement.
There is a substantial conflict of testimony, which is typical of
many of the
factual disputes in this case.  Mr Thompson said that Mr Foster was lying.
This piece of evidence was given in an emotional
and histrionic way, which
typified much of his testimony.  
<P>

39   	Mr Foster gave a short and circumstantial version.  He
said that in February 1997, before Inchcape's commencement of business
on 1
March 1997, he attended the office of Mr Thompson at Classic's premises at
Chatswood.  He explained to him that Inchcape would
be taking over from Capital
on that date and that it was necessary for a new Introducer Agreement to be
signed.  It was the same
as the "Capital Finance Agreement barring the change
in name".  He gave the document to Mr Thompson and said that "we require the
document to be signed".  It was necessary to "formalise our arrangement and be
ready for business on 1 March."  He said that Mr Thompson
assented, took the
document into the adjoining office where his wife was working and, shortly
thereafter, brought it back signed
by himself and his wife with the company
seal affixed.  Mr Foster says that he took the document back to Inchcape's
office and handed
it over to Mr Rowland.  
<P>

40   	Mr Thompson denies the whole episode.  He said that he
would never have signed such a document in these circumstances.  He
further
said that he kept the company seals, of which there were about ten for the
different companies in his organisation, at home
in his study and that he would
bring a seal into the office only when it was required for the execution of an
important document.
 Consequently, the company seal would not have been
available in his wife's office for the execution, on the spot, of the
Introducer
Agreement.  His wife was the company secretary and there was a safe
on the premises.  The company seals were too important to keep
in that safe.
She agreed with her husband in saying that important documents would not be
signed on the spot but would be the subject
of advice from accountants and
lawyers.  She remembered the previous Introducer Agreement with Capital but
could not remember the
occasion of it being signed in 1996, nor of the taking
of advice in respect of it.  This document had not been produced on notice
to
produce.  However, she said in evidence that she had searched for and found it
and handed it to her solicitor.  She seemed quite
clear about this.  However,
shortly after, in re-examination, she said she was not sure about this.  I
formed the view that her memory
was not reliable. 
<P>

41   	As to Mr Thompson's testimony, it is necessary to have
regard to other occasions in his evidence where his memory appeared
to be
deficient in relation to other documents which might have been regarded as of
importance.  In the course of the lengthy negotiations
in relation to the Floor
Plan Agreement, various letters of offer were given to him by Mr Foster.  One
such document, Exhibit H,
dated 5 June 1997, apparently produced on discovery,
could not be recalled by him.  He said that "Maybe it got lost in the system."
A subsequent document, Exhibit J, was dated 7 August 1997.  It was an important
document.  It contained an elaborate offer which
could be accepted in
principle, although subject to subsequent documentation.  Mr Thompson had
signed that document.  He said he
recollected signing it "vaguely" apparently
after having lunch with Mr Grant.  He undoubtedly received a very important
letter from
Mr Grant, Exhibit P, setting out Mr Grant's recollection of a
significant discussion between the two of them, consequent upon the
surfacing
of the Jimmy Lee problem.  It recorded Mr Grant's version of an oral agreement
reached between them in that discussion.
 Mr Thompson was unable to produce
this letter and said that he must have misplaced it.  In these respects and in
a number of other
respects to some of which I shall make reference later, I had
concerns as to the reliability of Mr Thompson's testimony.
<P>

42   	I find myself unpersuaded that the company seal was
handled with the care suggested in the evidence of Mr and Mrs Thompson.
 It is
not without significance that the Capital Introducer Agreement, Exhibit E,
after execution by Mr and Mrs Thompson, had had
an incorrect company seal
affixed to it.  Moreover if the execution of that document had taken place with
the solemnity suggested
in their evidence, I find it difficult to understand
why they could not recall at least some significant aspects of its execution,
the receipt of advice in respect of it, or explain how it was that the
incorrect seal was affixed.
<P>

43   	I prefer the evidence of Mr Foster.  I consider that the
suggestion by the defendants that he would lie about the execution
of this
document simply to protect his position in Inchcape is highly improbable.  It
was, obviously, a fairly insignificant document
in comparison with the
agreement that he was hoping to negotiate for the much more extensive financing
of Classic's operations. 
I should add that the rather elaborate evidence given
on behalf of Classic, illustrated by photographs, to the effect that Mr Foster
would not have been able to observe what was going on in Mrs Thompson's office
does not affect my view of the situation.  I do not
understand Mr Foster to
have claimed that he could make such an observation.
<P>

44   	However, there is a problem in relation to the Introducer
Agreement.  Before it could become effective it would need to have
been
executed on behalf of Inchcape.  There is no evidence that it was executed.
There is no evidence from Mr Rowland as to what
occurred after the document was
handed to him.  I am not prepared to find, on the balance of probabilities,
that the document ever
came into effect.  Consequently I dismiss Inchcape's
claim based upon the terms of the Introducer Agreement.  It is fair to say that
no real reliance was placed upon it in these proceedings.  However, I reject
the assertion that Mr Foster was lying in relation to
its execution and I draw
no adverse inference as to his credibility from this episode.  
<P>

45   	I turn then to the substance of Classic's defence.  It is
two-fold.  In the first place it is asserted that Mr Foster, as
State Manager
of Inchcape, authorised Classic to enter into "disclosed" third party deals in
February 1997 and later in October-November
1997 broadened this authorisation
to include "non-disclosed" third party transactions.  Alternatively, although,
perhaps, as part
of the same argument, it is asserted that at all relevant
times Mr Foster was aware of precisely what was going on in relation to
the
Purchall transactions and that his knowledge was, relevantly, the knowledge of
Inchcape, with the result that Inchcape was not
misled.  There are, of course,
legal questions involved in these defences.  However, as they are fundamentally
dependent upon the
view I form, on the facts, as to Mr Foster's involvement in
these matters, it is appropriate that I consider the factual questions
first.
<P>

46   	I should say, at the outset, that although, on occasions I
felt that Mr Foster's testimony might be a little glib and rehearsed,
my
overall impression, based, to a considerable extent, upon his demeanour in the
witness box, was that he was a reliable witness.
 He made a much more
favourable impression upon me than did Messrs Thompson, Kevern and Purchall and
Ms Whyte.  However, it is rare
that demeanour can be the sole determinant of
credibility.  It is necessary, of course, to consider the effect of the
evidence and
inferences that may be drawn from it.  
<P>

47   	As I have already indicated, Mr Foster was, throughout
1997 and into 1998 concerned with negotiating a larger agreement with
Classic
and with, in effect, taking over at least that part of AGC's business which
related to Classic's Volkswagen franchise.  Classic
relies upon certain events,
which occurred in the negotiations in February, as indicating agreement or
authorisation by Foster, on
behalf of Inchcape, for Classic's entering into the
Purchall transactions in November.  
<P>

48   	It is clear that Mr Foster attended a meeting at the
premises of Classic at Chatswood on 4 February 1997.  I am satisfied
that Mr
Thompson was present for only part of the meeting and that the discussion about
the projected business arrangements took
place between Mr Foster and Mr Kevern
and also Classic's financial adviser.  Mr Foster made a diary note of this
conversation shortly
after its occurrence.  After recording some aspects of the
discussion, the note concludes "outside deals okay from new/used dealership
to
be placed in letter of offer for retail paper."  
<P>

49   	There is also in evidence a letter of 4 February 1997
addressed to Mr Thompson and signed on behalf of Inchcape by Mr Foster
and a Mr
Wang.  Mr Foster's signature is dated 4 February 1997.  The letter itself is a
precursor to other letters which were part
of the negotiation process.  The
letter of 4 February 1997 commences with the sentence "Further to our recent
discussions, we are
pleased to submit an outline of our financial plan which
may be available to your dealership."  There follows an exposition of that
plan
under a number of headings.  The plan covers the projected provision of retail
finance and wholesale or financial floor plan
finance and related matters.  In
the portion relating to "RETAIL FINANCE" the following passage appears:
<P>

"Incentives are available to your dealership for retail business and are
applicable to standard fixed rate, fixed term loan, hire
purchase and lease
transactions only.  Maximum term of 60 months and a minimum amount financed of
$5,000 will apply.
<P>

<b>NON REGULATED TRANSACTIONS</b>:<b> </b>Lease / Term Purchase / Consumer
Lease Incentives will be paid at settlement on deal by deal basis.  
<P>

<b><i>REGULATED TRANSACTIONS:  </i></b><i>Consumer Loans</i>
<P>

Incentives will accumulate in your favour in our records and shall be payable
to your dealership monthly in arrears after adjustment
for rebates for
contracts predetermined within three (3) months of acceptance.
<P>

Notwithstanding (sic) the above, on a case by case basis we are pleased to
consider incentives on retail business which may be outside
the guidelines."
<P>

50   	Both Mr Thompson and Mr Kevern have given evidence that
they relied upon the passage in the letter of 4 February, 1997 as
indicating
agreement on the part of Inchcape for the entering into by them of third party
transactions which would be financed by
Inchcape.  They assert that the passage
in question is the fulfilment of the understanding recorded in the passage in
Mr Foster's
diary.  They claim, in effect, that an agreement corresponding to
that passage was reached at the meeting and that, as indicated,
it was "placed
in the letter of offer for retail paper", being, the letter of 4 February  
<P>

51   	I do not accept this.  In the first place I am satisfied
that letters outlining the financial plan were taken by Mr Foster
to the
meeting and that they were distributed and used as a basis for discussion at
the meeting.  That is Mr Foster's evidence and
I accept it.  It is
corroborated, in my view, by Exhibit 4 which is another copy of the same letter
upon which Mr Foster has made,
from time to time, short manuscript notes of
subsequent conversations between himself and representatives of Classic
relating to
the proposed plan.  I am satisfied that he took this letter to the
meeting of 4 February and retained it thereafter, using it in
subsequent
discussions.  Moreover, part of the diary note of that meeting, made by Mr
Foster, reads "Advised by DK that if Lionel
okays John will sign."  It is clear
from the evidence that "Lionel" was intended to refer to a Mr Neil Bettridge,
Classic's financial
controller, and that "DK" is Mr Kevern and "John" is Mr
Thompson.  The letter of 4 February, Exhibit F, was in fact signed by Mr
Thompson on 6 February, as appears from the exhibit.  In my view, this makes it
abundantly clear that the passage in Exhibit F relied
upon by Mr Thompson and
Mr Kevern was not, in fact, added as a result of the reference to outside deals
noted in the diary note.
 It has no relation at all to that part of the diary
note.  The reference to "retail business which may be outside the guidelines"
in the passage relied upon refers to "incentives" as discussed in the previous
parts of the passage.  There is no connection between
the passage relied upon
and the portion of the diary note.  Indeed, I am not satisfied that Mr Kevern
or Mr Thompson ever considered
that there was such a connection before the
advent of this litigation.  
<P>

52   	However, the diary note is indicative of what I accept to
be the position, namely that third party transactions were a feature
of motor
car sales which were well known to Mr Foster.  Finance companies would accept
them if they were satisfied as to their viability.
 In my view, Mr Foster's
note makes it plain that outside deals, i.e. third party transactions, were
acceptable if the supplier of
the relevant vehicle was a "new/used dealership".
The reason for this is obvious enough, on the evidence.  If the vehicle came
from
such a dealership then it might reasonably be expected that all the
necessary checks, to which reference has already been made, would
have taken
place.  I am satisfied that Mr Foster, at the meeting on 4 February, indicated
that Inchcape would consider receiving
third party applications of this limited
kind.
<P>

53   	It would appear that from time to time deals of this kind
were accepted by Inchcape.  The evidence does not indicate any pattern
of
acceptance.  I am satisfied that such occasions would have been rare and would
have been an exception to Inchcape's general policy
of not accepting such
transactions.  However, it is apparent that in December 1997 Mr Grant had
occasion to speak to Mr Foster in
relation to third party transactions that
were being introduced by way of a private broking company described in evidence
as E.F.S.
 It was conducted by a business manager at a motor dealership
referred to as "Trivett's".  Mr Foster knew and trusted the manager
in question
and had formed the view that the transactions would be advantageous for
Inchcape.  It is clear that they were not introduced
to Inchcape as relating to
vehicles sold by the Trivett dealership.  The true supplier was disclosed.
These were disclosed transactions,
apparently of the type referred to in the
discussion of 4 February.
<P>

54   	Mr Grant did not approve of the transactions.  They were
outside Inchcape's strict guidelines.  He instructed Mr Foster to
bring the
transactions to an end and, apart from two which had advanced to a stage where
Mr Grant obviously thought it was unreasonable
to halt them, they were
rejected.  Mr Grant issued instructions to Mr Foster that he and the
representatives under him should make
it clear to the dealerships associated
with Inchcape that third party deals would not be accepted.
<P>

55   	Both Mr Foster and Mr Noye gave evidence to the effect
that, pursuant to these instructions, they advised dealers, including
Classic,
that Inchcape would not accept third party transactions for financing.  Each,
however, placed the E.F.S. matter and the
receipt of instructions in the
October-November 1997 period and their notification to dealers as having taken
place in November.
 This alleged timing was clearly wrong in light of the date
of the E.F.S. transactions, as demonstrated from documents relating to
them
which were tendered in evidence.  Both Mr Thompson and Mr Kevern denied
receiving any indication from Messrs Foster or Noye
to the effect that Inchcape
would not accept third party transactions.  On the contrary Mr Kevern asserted
that in November he was
specifically authorised by Mr Foster that he could
present to Inchcape "non-disclosed" third party transactions.  He further
asserted
that he was instructed by Mr Foster to present Mr Purchall's
transactions to Inchcape as transactions emanating from Classic and
in respect
of vehicles owned by Classic.  This non-disclosure was to be effected both on
the application form and the invoice.  The
giving of this authorisation and
instruction was firmly denied both by Mr Foster and Mr Noye.  
<P>

56   	In this context, what effect should be given to the
evidence relating to the E.F.S. transactions and their sequelae?  Considerable
reliance is placed upon them by Classic as indicating that both Mr Foster and
Mr Noye are untruthful in their denials.  I have given
careful consideration to
this submission as, undoubtedly, each are incorrect when they assert that they
notified Classic in November
that Inchcape would not accept third party deals
for financing.  Moreover, it would appear that the dating of the E.F.S.
controversy
in December only became apparent during the course of the hearing
when documents relating to those transactions became available.
 This led to
the suggestion that Messrs Foster and Noye had deliberately chosen a November
date for the making of the alleged notification
in order that it would coincide
with the commencement of the disguised Purchall transactions, thus eliminating
any suggestion that
they had a part in those transactions.  It was suggested
that they had been caught out, in an obvious attempt to fabricate evidence,
by
the late revelation of the true date of the E.F.S. episode.
<P>

57   	I have given, I consider, due weight to these submissions.
I am not satisfied that the facts have the significance sought
to be attributed
to them.  In the first place the incorrect dating appears in the affidavit
evidence.  In the affidavits of both
witnesses the connection between the
E.F.S. incidents and the giving of the warning pursuant to Mr Grant's
instructions are clearly
connected.  The references to the E.F.S. transactions
were made in circumstances clearly inviting investigation in the way in which
it in fact occurred.  It would, plainly, have been very foolish to have lied in
the affidavits in circumstances where exposure of
the lie could so easily have
been achieved.  This makes more likely the alternative explanation, that a
mistake was made in the recollection
of the dates.  Moreover, if the assumption
is made that Messrs Foster and Noye were not involved in the deception that was
being
practised on Inchcape from November onwards by Messrs Kevern and
Purchall, then there would be nothing to indicate to them that Classic
was
forwarding to Inchcape any third party transactions at all.  In these
circumstances, in following out Mr Grant's instructions,
they would not have
been seeking to bring to an end any third party deals of which they actually
knew, let alone an established pattern
of dealing, such as was present in the
E.F.S. transactions.  There would be nothing to make the giving of the warning,
in those circumstances,
particularly memorable, other than that it followed
upon the instruction given by Mr Grant.  In such circumstances, reliance simply
upon recollection, without making a check against documentation which would
have been available, could easily produce a mistake as
to the date of the
giving of the warning.  An intention deliberately to lie would have involved,
as a matter of prudence, checking
the dates of the E.F.S. incident before
committing the lie to affidavit form.  
<P>

58   	Moreover, if Messrs Foster and Noye were involved in the
Purchall transactions which had been increasing in volume in November
and
December common prudence would surely have suggested that, after Mr Grant's
clear instructions had been received, they or at
least Mr Foster would have
taken positive steps to prevent the transactions continuing.  It must be
remembered that the evidence
clearly indicates that they had nothing to gain
from these transactions, other than such kudos as might accrue to them from
increasing
Inchcape's business with Classic.  It was acknowledged by Mr Kevern
that there was no agreement that either of them should share
in the commission
income that was being generated.  Nor was there remuneration from Inchcape
based upon the volume of introduced
business.  The risk of continuing the
transactions after Mr Grant's clear instructions would have been significantly
high, especially
in circumstances where no private gain was in contemplation.
When I take all these considerations into account I consider that the
likelihood of the matter is that the warning was given and that, in the
circumstances, it was given perfunctorily, there being no
indication that any
third party dealing was in fact going on, and that in making their affidavits
they were simply mistaken as to
the date.  
<P>

59   	I come then to consider other evidence bearing upon the
issue of whether Mr Foster was a knowing participant in the Purchall
transactions.  That is, whether he widened, as alleged, his authorisation for
disclosed third party transactions given in February
1997 to the authorisation
in November 1997 of "non-disclosed transactions".  
<P>

60   	It is to be noted that Mr Thompson does not allege that Mr
Foster spoke to him about any such widening.  Moreover, to speak
of a
progression from authorisation of disclosed third party transactions to
non-disclosed third party transactions, as though it
were nothing but a natural
evolutionary process, is clearly nonsensical.  The first type of transaction
was one clearly recognised
in the trade and, if subject to proper safeguards,
was acceptable.  The other necessarily involved deception being practised on
the
finance company.  In my opinion it could never be acceptable.  The
defendants' argument that, in effect, Mr Foster might readily
slip from one
form of authorisation to the other would seem to be contrary to common sense.
He would be procuring deception of his
employer.  The only motive suggested for
his taking such an unworthy and dangerous step was a desire to enhance his
position in Inchcape
by increasing the flow of business from Classic.  This
would seem to be an extraordinarily poor motive for such an undertaking.
However,
it is the defendants' case that Mr Foster did so.  I turn, then, to
consider the evidence called by the defendants in this regard.
<P>

61   	The genesis of Classic's involvement with the Purchall
transactions was an approach made by Mr Purchall to Mr Kevern in late
October
1997.  He told Mr Kevern that he had a number of transactions in respect of
which finance was required and asked whether
Classic would be interested in
processing them as outside deals.  They consisted of deals coming from small
dealerships and also
some private deals and deals involving refinancing of
vehicles.  It is clear that the idea was to obtain the necessary finance
through
Classic's relationship with Inchcape.  Obviously, because of the large
number of transactions in contemplation, there would be significant
commissions
to be earned.  I am satisfied that there was discussion as to how such
commissions should be split between Classic, Mr
Purchall and Mr Kevern's
company, Janafe.
<P>

62   	Mr Kevern took the suggested deal to Mr Thompson.  This
occurred the following day.  Both Mr Thompson and Mr Kevern give evidence
as to
what was said.  Mr Thompson gives the more circumstancial account both in his
affidavit and orally.  I am satisfied that Mr
Kevern came to his office and
said "John, Purchie's got some outside business.  We could put it through
Inchcape.  We can make some
money out of this".  Mr Thompson enquired where the
vehicles would be coming from and was told that they would come from a
particular
dealership.  Mr Thompson knew the proprietor and, accordingly,
agreed.  He asked who the other suppliers would be and was told that
the
vehicles would come from "an accountant at Parramatta" and someone else.  He
expressed the view that that part of it could be
"risky business" as "they are
the ones you have to be careful of."  He said "just do it according to the book
and, as long as Inchcape
are happy with it, I am happy."  It is clear that he
also indicated that appropriate checks should be made.  The cars should be
sighted,
and REVS checks, bank statements and registration certificates
obtained.  He was advised that "Purchie will check them out".  
<P>

63   	It is clear that Mr Purchall also had a conversation with
John Thompson shortly after this in which Mr Thompson asked where
the business
was coming from and was given the same reply as Mr Kevern had previously given.
He required of Mr Purchall that he do
all the necessary checks.  Mr Purchall
responded that he would do so.  
<P>

64   	I am also satisfied that at about the same time, Mr
Purchall had a further conversation with Mr Kevern in the terms which
appear in
Mr Purchall's affidavit, namely:
<P>

"DK:	"Chatswood Classic has to invoice the goods.  You have got to sight the

<P>

vehicles and do the necessary REVS checks."
<P>

JP:	"I agree with those terms.""
<P>

65   	Following upon these conversations, Mr Purchall began to
introduce transactions.  The business was performed in the way it
had been
discussed.  Quite clearly, it could have been conducted in this way without the
receipt of any instructions from anyone
at Inchcape.  Classic had the necessary
Inchcape application forms.  It was provided with the necessary information for
the completion
of the forms by Mr Purchall, either orally or through faxed
instructions, and documents were provided such as certificates of registration
and true Form 4s in respect of the vehicles.  Mr Kevern and Ms Whyte required
no assistance from anyone on the part of Inchcape to
fill out the application
forms showing, incorrectly, that Classic was the supplier of the vehicles and
also to supply invoices incorrectly
showing Classic as the owner and supplier.
Clearly enough the whole scheme could have been put into effect without any
outside instructions.
<P>

66   	However, Mr Kevern asserts that Messrs Foster and Noye
were directly involved from the outset.  He says that within a week
of his
discussion with Mr Thompson he spoke to Mr Foster in his office at Classic.  He
gives the following account in his oral testimony:
<P>

"Q.	Would you please tell his Honour what you said and what Foster said at that
discussion.
<P>

A.	Certainly.  I started off by saying to Robert Foster: 
<P>

"John Purchall, who I believe you know from your  Citibank days, and as you
know has been associated with Chatswood Classic and
at another dealership, that
John Thompson used to own at Collaroy, has got some outside business".
<P>

I explained to him that he was getting it from Haberfield Autos, he had
accountants that used to supply business.  He also had a
financial planning
organisation that he used to get some business from.  I asked Robert, would
Inchcape be interested in looking
at that business?  
<P>

Q.	Did he say anything to you?
<P>

A.	No, he replied, yes, he did remember John Purchall from his Citibank days
and that he would only accept that business from Chatswood
Classic Cars as if
we had to invoice the deals through Chatswood Classic Cars, as if we were
supplying the vehicles."
<P>

67   	This evidence was contrary to the version he had
previously given in his affidavit.  There he had sworn that Mr Foster had
not
replied immediately but had got back to him the following day with his reply,
which was in similar terms.  Considering the importance
of the conversation, I
consider this discrepancy to be of some significance.  In his evidence he
explained it on the basis that he
was, at the time of the making of the
affidavit, confusing the occasion of Mr Foster's reply with the occasion,
occurring a couple
of days after the conversation with Mr Foster, when, he
alleges, Mr Noye had a conversation with him confirming the arrangement that
deals were to be invoiced through Classic.  I feel there is little substance in
this explanation, as the affidavit also refers to
the Noye conversation.  In
his oral testimony he describes the conversation with Noye as follows:
<P>

"Q.	Would you please tell the Court what was said in that conversation?
<P>

A.	Certainly.  I said to Richard that I had conversations with Robert Foster
regarding John Purchall and some outside deals.  I
asked Richard, had Robert
spoken to him?  Richard Noye replied to me:
<P>

"Yes, he has.  I believe Chatswood Classic Cars will be invoicing all the
vehicles."
<P>

Q.	Anything further at that conversation?
<P>

A.	No, that was it.  I replied,  "Well that's good that you know about it.""
<P>

68   	These two conversations form the basis of the defendants'
case that, in forwarding the series of disguised third party transactions
to
Inchcape for approval, they were doing so at the express direction of Mr
Foster, in collaboration with Mr Noye.  Both men firmly
deny that the
conversations occurred.  I have already indicated that I hold a reasonably
favourable view of Mr Foster as a witness.
 I was similarly impressed by Mr
Noye who, so far as demeanour in the witness box can take the matter, appeared
to be a truthful
and reliable witness.  
<P>

69   	I was, on the contrary, not impressed by the evidence of
Mr Kevern.  His demeanour did little to inspire confidence in his
testimony.
He was both voluble and evasive in answering questions.  He was cross-examined,
at considerable length, in relation to
matters to which I have already made
reference, namely the forwarding of application forms which erroneously
described Classic as
the supplier of the vehicles, the disparity between
information in the forms and that supplied by Mr Purchall, the forwarding of
false Form 4s, and the retention from Inchcape of the correct Form 4s and other
documentary material which would have indicated the
true nature of the
transactions in respect of which finance was being sought.  Whenever he was in
difficulty in answering questions
on these topics, which happened frequently,
he resorted to a stock answer to the effect that Mr Foster and Mr Noye knew
what was
going on.  One answer that he gave I found to be quite significant.
Having repeatedly indicated that both Mr Foster and Mr Noye had
been party to a
course of conduct which could only have led to deception of their employer, he
responded to a question in cross-examination
by saying that he thought that
they were acting honestly.  Of course, had he answered to the contrary, he
would have been obliged
to admit that he himself was involved in this
dishonesty.  I have already set-out a portion of his evidence which indicated
quite
clearly that, in respect of the Chan transaction, he knew perfectly well
that Inchcape was being misled.
<P>

70   	Mr Kevern gave much more evidence in which he sought to
portray Mr Foster as the guiding hand behind the Purchall transactions.
 He
swore that Mr Foster had told Mr Purchall "to sight all vehicles and forward
copies of the registration papers so that Mr Foster
could be satisfied as to
the ownership of the vehicle."  This would account, of course, for his receipt
of registration certificates
and correct Form 4s from Mr Purchall and their
presence in Classic files kept by him.  It may be noted, incidentally, that he
swore
that he did not send these registration papers and other evidence of
title to Inchcape because he was never asked for them.  He denied
that he had
deliberately not sent them on.  This evidence, in my view, is unacceptable.
The material, if furnished to Inchcape, would
have resulted in the revelation
that Classic, was not, as represented in the other material forwarded by Mr
Kevern, the owner and
supplier of the vehicle.  Moreover, this evidence is
quite contrary to evidence given by Mr Purchall.  Mr Purchall was quite adamant
that he did not meet Mr Foster until late December or early January, although
he said that he had met Mr Noye previously.  He was
quite clear that he had
commenced submitting his deals to Classic before he had any meetings with
anyone from Inchcape.  He said
his first contact was with Mr Kevern when "we
cleared up that it was acceptable for me to do it for Mr Kevern and Mr
Thompson" and
that was before he sent in any applications.  He gave this
evidence in chief.  In cross-examination he agreed that he did not discuss
with
Mr Foster "certificates of registration or REVS checks or checking vehicles
before May 1998" and he stated that David Kevern
had told him that "it was the
instructions of Mr Thompson that he should sight all vehicles that weren't
coming from dealers and
get copies of registration papers and do REVS checks."
In light of this evidence it is quite impossible to accept Mr Kevern's
assertion
that Mr Foster was the source of the precise instructions as to the
checks to be made by Mr Purchall in respect of the vehicles he
financed.  I am
satisfied that Mr Kevern introduced this evidence in an attempt to bolster his
allegations that Mr Foster was the
controlling mind in the Purchall
transactions.
<P>

71   	It was also part of Mr Kevern's evidence that both Mr
Foster and Mr Noye regularly discussed with him the Purchall transactions
during the course of their frequent visits to the Classic dealership.  He said
that in the course of a twenty minute discussion Mr
Purchall's name would be
mentioned at least ten times.  Furthermore, if the initial conversation with Mr
Foster had in fact occurred
and the instructions had then been given to invoice
all the vehicles from Classic, it would be most unlikely that Mr Kevern would
not have discussed this conversation with Mr Purchall.  Indeed, one would have
expected that by December 1998 Mr Purchall would have
been thoroughly familiar
with Mr Foster's role in the scheme and that Mr Foster would, himself, be
thoroughly aware of Mr Purchall's
identity and function.  However, Mr
Purchall's evidence as to the single meeting he alleges occurred between him
and Mr Foster, before
the Jimmy Lee problem surfaced in May 1998 does not fit
in with this scenario. 
<P>

72   	Having said that he felt sure he had come across the name
of Mr Foster when Mr Foster had been working at Citibank, he said
that he
remembered meeting him in Mr Kevern's office either late December 1997 or early
January 1998 when he was introduced to him
by Mr Kevern.  He said the
introduction took the following form:  "This is Purchie.  He has been
introducing business from other
dealers to us."  Considering the alleged
involvement of Mr Foster in the whole scheme to the full knowledge of Mr
Purchall, it is
quite impossible, in my view, that Mr Kevern would have
introduced the two men in this way.  Mr Foster does not accept that this
meeting occurred. 
<P>

73   	I was not impressed by Mr Purchall's demeanour in the
witness box.  He was very guarded in committing himself in cross-examination
when there was an obvious risk of his being caught out by documentary evidence.
His evidence is important in the alleged implication
of Mr Noye in the scheme.
I shall refer to that now.
<P>

74   	I have already referred to Mr Kevern's evidence as to the
alleged conversation with Mr Noye shortly after the initial conversation
with
Mr Foster.  This was alleged to have taken place in Mr Kevern's office.  It may
be noted that the office was shared by Ms Whyte.
 They shared a desk and were,
for the most part, in the office together.  Ms Whyte gives no evidence as to
hearing Mr Noye making
the statement alleged.  Mr Purchall, in his affidavit
evidence and in his oral evidence in chief, made no mention of hearing any
statement from Noye to the effect that the vehicles should be invoiced from
Classic.  However, in his cross-examination he made reference
to this, for the
first time, in an unresponsive answer.  I set out the whole passage so that the
statement can be seen in context.
 It is as follows:
<P>

"Q.  On the occasion you spoke first to Mr Kevern and Mr Thompson about doing
this business, you remember that?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  And you say that was in either late October or early November?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  Is that right?  One or other of them said you had to do the usual checks,
the registration, REVS check, statutory declaration?
 Did they also suggest you
get a statutory declaration?
<P>

A.  No, that is something I use myself when it is a sale and lease back, it
protects me.
<P>

Q.  And did, at that time I take it there was discussion about the fact that
the invoices would be issued by Chatswood Classic?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  Did that they, at that time, give you copies of Chatswood Classic invoices?
That is blank forms so you could complete them?
<P>

A.  On the occasions when I had completed them it would have been done in
Chatswood Classic office.  I don't have any Chatswood
Classic documentation.
<P>

Q.  Was it discussed that on the Inchcape applications the introducer and
supplier would be described as Chatswood Classic?
<P>

A.  They were to be the introducer.
<P>

Q.  Yes?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  And the supplier?
<P>

A.  And the supplier.  These were the instructions given to Mr Kevern from
Richard Noye in my presence.
<P>

Q.  I see, when did that conversation take place?
<P>

A.  When we first started introducing business.
<P>

Q.  You have not given any evidence about that in your evidence-in-chief, have
you?
<P>

A.  I don't recall.  I mean, if it's not in there, it's not in there.
<P>

Q.  And I suggest it is a lie?
<P>

A.  No, sir.
<P>

Q.  You have never met Richard Noye, have you?
<P>

A.  Many times.  Half a dozen times in David Kevern's office, at least, in the
presence of others."
<P>

75   	The written transcript does not, of course, reproduce the
effect of the evidence as given in Court.  Although the initial
questions, as
recorded, are somewhat lacking in specificity, there was no doubt, in my
recollection, that they were directed to the
activities of Mr Kevern and Mr
Thompson in late October or early November.  The "discussion" referred to was a
suggested discussion
between Mr Purchall and them or either of them.  The
reference to Mr Noye had all the appearance of being introduced by Mr Purchall
in an attempt to undo the damage, which his answers were creating, to the case
made against Messrs Foster and Noye.  This was in
circumstances where he knew
that Mr Noye alleged that he had never met Mr Purchall.
<P>

76   	Later when he was being cross-examined on the topic of the
Form 4 notices the following occurred:
<P>

"MEAGHER:  Q.  You have not given any evidence about any conversations you say
you had with either Mr Foster or Mr Noye about Form
4 notices, have you?
<P>

A.  I have not.
<P>

*Q.  And that's because you don't suggest that you did have any conversations
with either of those gentlemen about Form 4 notices?
<P>

A.  I understood from Mr Kevern that--
<P>

Q.  Please, address my question.
<P>

A.  Would you repeat the question?
<P>

QUESTION MARKED * READ
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  That is Foster or Noye?
<P>

A.  I had no direct conversation with Foster or Noye regarding Form 4s.
<P>

MEAGHER:  Q.  All your conversations were with Mr Kevern, were they?
<P>

A.  My conversations regarding that matter, as a conversation with dialogue,
were with Mr Kevern.  However, I was there  with Mr
Kevern and with Sharleine
Whyte in David Kevern's office when Mr Noye laid down that the vehicles had to
be invoiced through Chatswood
Classic Cars.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  What did that have to do with Form 4s?
<P>

A.  In the trade generally, if the car is a warrantable car it is required that
the finance company requires evidence that the car
engine number, VIN number,
registration numbers, correspond to the documents given, the invoice and the
details on the contract.
<P>

Q.  The Form 4 is a way of supplying that evidence?
<P>

A.  It is an accepted way of supplying that evidence, that most finance
companies do ask for.
<P>

MEAGHER:  Q. Do you accept there is a distinction between a genuine Form 4 and
a dummy or false Form 4?
<P>

A.  Yes, I do.
<P>

Q.  You don't suggest, do you, in the ordinary course of events finance
companies accept dummies or false Form 4s, do you?
<P>

A.  I would think that, knowingly, they wouldn't.
<P>

Q.  You say that there was an occasion, was it in Mr Kevern's office when Mr
Noye was present and he talked about invoices?  Is
that what you say?
<P>

A.  About invoices?  No.  His instructions were for the business that I
submitted that Chatswood Classic Cars had to invoice the
vehicles.
<P>

Q.  Were you present when Mr Noye said that?
<P>

A.  Yes, I was.
<P>

Q.  Where did that statement take place?
<P>

A.  Where?
<P>

Q.  Yes?
<P>

A.  In Mr Kevern's office.
<P>

Q.  Who was present?
<P>

A.  Myself, Mr Kevern, Mr Noye and probably, but I can't say with 100 per cent
certainty, Sharleine Whyte.
<P>

Q.  What do you say Mr Noye said?
<P>

A.  That the contracts--
<P>

Q.  Try and give us--
<P>

A.  Words to the effect that all the deals that had to be submitted had to be
invoiced by Chatswood Classic to Inchcape.
<P>

Q.  Is that all he said?
<P>

A.  Words to that effect, yes.
<P>

Q.  When do you say that was?
<P>

A.  Before we started submitting the business.
<P>

Q.  When do you say that was?
<P>

A.  Before we started submitting the business.
<P>

Q.  In October 1997? 
<P>

A.  October/November, yes.  Before we started submitting the business.
<P>

Q.  When did you start submitting the business?
<P>

A.  In October or November 1997.
<P>

Q.  Do you say this was after the conversations you had had with Mr Kevern and
Mr Thompson?
<P>

A.  I do.
<P>

Q.  And I suggest to you that your evidence in this respect is just false,
isn't it?
<P>

A.  No, sir.
<P>

Q.  You are making it up?
<P>

A.  No, sir.
<P>

Q.  And Mr Purchall, there is no reference to this conversation with Mr Noye in
either of your affidavits, is there?
<P>

A.  (No answer).
<P>

Q.  You know there isn't, don't you?
<P>

A.  There is no evidence, not in the affidavit.
<P>

Q.  You didn't give any evidence in your evidence-in-chief when you answered
the questions of Mr Neil?
<P>

A.  I answered the questions.
<P>

Q.  You made no reference of this conversation with Mr Noye in your
evidence-in-chief?
<P>

A.  I was not asked the question.
<P>

Q.  You understood when you gave your evidence-in-chief that the critical issue
in this case, or one of the critical issues, is
whether Inchcape knew that this
business was third party business.  You knew that, didn't you?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  And if you were present at a conversation with Mr Noye in which he said to
you, "These applications have to be naming Chatswood
as supplier and the
invoices have to be issued by Chatswood" that would have been critical,
wouldn't it?
<P>

A.  Critical to what?
<P>

Q.  Critical evidence to assist his Honour to decide who is telling truth?
<P>

A.  I answered the questions that were put to me, sir.
<P>

Q.  I suggest you just made that evidence up?
<P>

A.  No, sir."
<P>

77   	Again, I have set out the passage at length so that the
evidence given as to Mr Noye's alleged statement on invoicing can
be observed
in context.  The transcript does not capture the atmosphere of the courtroom.
Another unresponsive answer was being thrust
upon the cross-examiner.  I gained
the distinct impression that Mr Purchall was concerned that his previous
attempt to make this
point had not been very successful and he wished to try
again.  On this occasion he attempted to add verisimilitude by reference
to the
presence of Ms Whyte.  When the topic was returned to after some questioning on
Form 4 matters (in which he conceded that
finance companies would not knowingly
accept false Form 4s), he diluted the earlier statement by saying that he
couldn't "with 100%
certainty" assert that Sharleine Whyte had been present.
Only a short time before he had had no hesitation in asserting positively
that
she was.  I felt that he had had misgivings about the earlier statement, as it
had occurred to him that he could be in conflict
with Ms Whyte's evidence,
which in fact he was.  I was not impressed with his demeanour in the course of
this evidence.  
<P>

78   	I have already set out Mr Kevern's version of this alleged
conversation with Mr Purchall.  I am satisfied that it was an attempt
on his
part to recount the same alleged conversation.  It is significantly different
from the version given by Mr Purchall.  It would
be unreasonable to assume that
they were seeking to give evidence of two different conversations as the thrust
of each was suggested
instructions given by Mr Noye in relation to the highly
significant matter of the false invoicing.  Mr Kevern does not suggest that
Mr
Purchall was present.  Indeed the alleged conversation as recounted by Mr
Kevern strongly suggests that he was not.  Nor does
Mr Kevern suggest that Ms
Whyte was present at the conversation.  Moreover, Mr Kevern's version can
hardly be described as a "laying
down of instructions" to them by Mr Noye. 
<P>

79   	In the situation that Mr Noye denies ever having met Mr
Purchall, let alone having conversations such as this with him, I
find the
discrepancies between the versions of Mr Kevern and Mr Purchall to be highly
significant.
<P>

80   	Mr Kevern gave further evidence as to the complicity of
Messrs Foster and Noye in the Purchall transactions.  He said that
both men
were regularly in his office after the transactions commenced and discussed
them with him.  The paperwork in relation to
the transactions was kept in trays
upon his desk.  The trays were also used by Ms Whyte.  The evidence establishes
that there were
three such trays arranged vertically.  The top tray contained
material relating to AGC.  The second tray contained copies of the
material
forwarded to Inchcape.  The bottom tray contained the material forwarded to
Inchcape together with Inchcape's approvals.
 The evidence establishes, also,
that after a transaction had been finalised by payment, Mr Purchall would
forward to Classic the
whole of his file of material relating to it.  This
would put into Classic's possession material such as certificates of
registration
in respect of the vehicles and Form 4 notices which had been
attached to those vehicles at the other dealerships.  As already indicated,
this sort of material was present in the files kept by Classic but was not
present in Inchcape's files, because it was never forwarded
to them.  
<P>

81   	Mr Kevern avers that in the course of regular discussions
with the two men he would discuss the Purchall transactions separately
from
such transactions as were, in fact, ordinary transactions emanating from
Classic.  He says that he would separate the documents
and place them on the
desk so that they could be separately examined.  The Purchall transactions
would then be discussed separately
from the Classic transactions.  I consider
that this evidence is an attempt by Mr Kevern to attach plausibility to his
contention
that the Inchcape men were well aware of the Purchall transactions.
Both men deny it.  It is most significant that Ms Whyte who,
it appears quite
clearly, would have been present on most, if not all, of these alleged
occasions does not corroborate this.  In
fact she states in her evidence that
she never saw Mr Foster looking at any of the documents contained in the trays.
She did see
Mr Noye in Mr Kevern's office on a far more regular basis than Mr
Foster.  She says that the documents he looked at came from the
middle tray.
Her evidence establishes that these documents were the documents sent to
Inchcape, namely the application forms and
privacy authorities.  These
documents bore no indication that the vehicles originated from Mr Purchall.
Indeed, the application forms
indicated that they came from Classic.  
<P>

82   	Mr Kevern went further in his evidence.  He said that both
men would specifically examine the material which came from Mr
Purchall to
determine whether appropriate checks such as REVS checks had been made
according to, as he suggested, Mr Foster's instructions
in that regard.  Quite
apart from Ms Whyte's evidence that Mr Foster did not look at any documents,
there is a basic lack of likelihood
in this evidence.  It is clear that Mr
Purchall provided this material after the matters had been settled, that is
after Inchcape
had paid out the money.  One wonders what purpose could be
served by Messrs Foster and Noye satisfying themselves that all appropriate
checks had been made after payment had occurred.  I am satisfied that Mr
Kevern's evidence in this regard is not worthy of acceptance.
 
<P>

83   	Mr Kevern also sought to involve Mr Foster in the use of
the sham Form 4 notices in some of the Purchall transactions.  As
has been
seen, Mr Purchall does not claim to have had any discussions with the men about
the use of these documents.  However, Mr
Kevern sought to implicate Mr Foster
as a result of conversations which he said occurred, the first in mid December
1997 to early
1998 and the second about two and a half months later.  He says
that the first conversation occurred as a result of his receiving
a request
from a relevant underwriter via a BSR for the provision of a Form 4, as a
condition of approval.  It is perfectly plain
that if he had forwarded a
correct Form 4 supplied through Mr Purchall this would have indicated that the
vehicle in question was
not being sold to Inchcape by Classic.  There was,
therefore, an obvious problem relating to the exposure of the true nature of
the
deal.  However, he did not discuss this problem with Mr Foster, in a way
that might have been expected if, indeed, Mr Foster was,
in effect, a
co-conspirator.  He says that he complained to Mr Foster that if he sent along
a Form 4 purporting to come from Classic
Cars then Classic might be involved in
the warranty obligations associated with such a form.  He also says that he
complained that
the vehicle was not subject to warranty, as it fell outside the
ambit of the relevant regulations.  No explanation is given as to
why Inchcape
was not simply informed that no Form 4 existed, for this reason.  However, Mr
Kevern stated that Mr Foster told him
that he would fix the matter up.
Thereafter, he says, there were no applications for Form 4s until the requests
appeared again some
two and a half months later.  He says that he approached Mr
Foster again who said he would make enquiries and later told him that
the Form
4s were only required for the checking of the relevant particulars of the
vehicle.  In my opinion, it would have been plain
to anyone associated, as long
as Mr Kevern had been, with the financing of motor vehicles, that this would
always have been the purpose
of the request.  However, Mr Kevern appears to put
forward this alleged statement by Mr Foster as a satisfactory reason for his
issuing
the bogus documents.  I simply do not accept his evidence on this
topic.  
<P>

84   	I should add that Ms Whyte gave clear evidence that Mr
Kevern gave her instructions in relation to these documents, which
were kept,
in blank form, in a drawer in the office.  She agreed that Mr Kevern said to
her that "if Inchcape ever asks for a Form
4 just complete one of these and
copy it and fax it off".  She also agreed that she had had no conversation
about the Form 4s with
either Mr Foster or Mr Noye.  She also stated that Mr
Kevern had told her that the Form 4s had always to be issued by Chatswood
Classic
because it was issuing the invoices.  Her evidence may be contrasted
with that of Mr Kevern, given in cross-examination in relation
to a particular
bogus Form 4.   The passage is as follows:
<P>

"Q.	Did you tell her that if she got requests for Form 4s she could prepare
dummy Form 4s?
<P>

A.	I never exactly said it in those words to her.
<P>

Q.	What were the words you said to her?
<P>

A.	She was present when Robert Foster and that were talking about Form 4s and
she would have thought that's what they want, that's
what she will give them; a
Form 4."
<P>

I do not accept this evidence.
<P>

85   	I am satisfied that there was no discussion with either Mr
Foster or Mr Noye about the use of these forged documents and that
they were
unaware of the deception which was being practised when they were forwarded to
Inchcape.  
<P>

86   	It is necessary to refer to two areas of the evidence in
which it was sought to implicate Mr Noye in the Purchall transactions.
 The
first relates to the topic of the interest rates being charged in the
transactions.  Mr Kevern said that about mid December
1997 to mid January 1998
he received a phone call from Mr Noye, in which Mr Noye stated that Mr Foster
and he had discussed the interest
rates and that they would like Mr Purchall to
vary them a little bit.  He agreed to let Mr Purchall know and did so by
telephone.
 A few days later, he says, in the course of a weekly call, Mr Noye
gave the same instruction to Mr Purchall, who happened to be
in Mr Kevern's
office.  He said that Mr Noye gave no reason for the request to make the
variation.  He was cross-examined as to whether
Mr Noye had advanced a reason
along the lines that too many deals at a high rate of 17% would draw attention
and would look suspicious.
 He did not vary his evidence that no reasons had
been given but said that "it was obviously thought of."  Ms Whyte gave some
evidence
on this topic.  In her affidavit she said that she recalled that on
one occasion either Mr Foster or Mr Noye spoke to Mr Kevern and
herself in
relation to interest rates.  In her oral testimony, the following version was
given:
<P>

"Q.	Could you please tell his Honour what you heard anybody say during that
conversation and try, if you can, to put it in italics,
in the first person if
possible?
<P>

A.	Okay.  I remember the conversation, a conversation between David Kevern and
Richard Noye in regards to interest rates being very
high, at around 18, 19 per
cent.
<P>

Q.	And who said what?
<P>

A.	Dave, this is Richard Noye talking to David, saying they were all very high,
around the 18, 19 per cent and they needed to be
adjusted accordingly.
<P>

Q.	Do you recall him saying anything else?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	Do you recall if Mr Kevern said anything?
<P>

A.	David just agreed with what he said, asking him why and I don't really
recall what Richard said then."
<P>

87   	It is to be noted that Ms Whyte makes no reference in her
affidavit or oral testimony to Mr Purchall being at this conversation.
 There
is obvious conflict with Mr Kevern, in that he says that the conversation he
had with Mr Noye alone took place over the telephone.
 I am in some doubt as to
whether I can place any reliance at all upon Ms Whyte's evidence in this
regard.  However, she may well
have heard a conversation about interest rates.
Such a conversation could well have taken place between Messrs Kevern and
Purchall
in her presence and with the passage of time she has come to think
that it involved Mr Noye.  Also the reference to the interest
rates of "around
18, 19 per cent" causes some difficulty.  The evidence in the case suggests
that interest rates were not higher
than 17%.  In any event, I cannot regard
her evidence as corroborating that of Mr Kevern as to his alleged conversation
with Mr Noye.
 Furthermore, it can have no corroborative effect in relation to
the alleged second conversation, which involved Mr Purchall.  I
turn then to
that alleged conversation.
<P>

88   	Mr Kevern's version has already been given.  Mr Purchall
said in evidence that he met Mr Noye some five or six times and that
the
conversation occurred on the second or third meeting.  Mr Noye was looking
through the applications in Mr Kevern's office and
"he mentioned that the
interest rates on the applications were all around 17% and suggested that we
should vary them because it makes
it look too obvious that they were not deals
from within Chatswood Classic Cars."  Mr Purchall says that he then agreed to
vary the
rates.
<P>

89   	Mr Purchall was cross-examined about this alleged
conversation.  He agreed that the person to whom "it would look too obvious"
was "Inchcape".  However, when asked whether he believed it "was all a secret
from Inchcape" he said that he didn't know.  It was
put to him that there were
two possibilities, one that he was making it all up and the other that he knew
it was a secret from Inchcape
and he was joining in the secret.  His answer was
"no, it was just the procedure that had to be followed.  I believe Inchcape
were
well aware."  He was then asked the following questions and gave the
following answers:
<P>

"Q.	If you believed that this was all well known within Inchcape, what was the
point of Mr Noye saying to you, as you say he said,
that:
<P>

"We should vary the interest rates, because it looks too obvious that these
deals are not from Chatswood"?
<P>

A.	I have no idea why he said that, but he said it.
<P>

Q.	I suggest to you he never said it?
<P>

A.	That is not true.
<P>

Q.	And you never met him?
<P>

A.	That is not true."
<P>

90   	The matter was revisited in further cross-examination.  Mr
Purchall maintained that he did not know why Mr Noye had said this
to him.  He
also said that he, obediently, varied the rates in accordance with Mr Noye's
direction.  It seems quite obvious that
Mr Purchall was prepared to give
evidence implicating Mr Noye in the deception of Inchcape, his employer, but
was not prepared to
accept that the same evidence, if accepted, would
necessarily implicate him.  Moreover, an examination of the interest rates
charged
in the applications submitted after the time of this alleged
conversation does not demonstrate any significant downward variation.
<P>

91   	Evidence was given by these witnesses that Mr Noye had
regular conversations with Mr Purchall in Mr Kevern's office.  It appears
that
Mr Purchall would have visited Mr Kevern's office about five or six times in
the period November 1997 to May 1998.  It is, of
course, possible that one or
more of these visits may have coincided with Mr Noye's regular visits to Mr
Kevern.  However, this is
not necessarily so, especially as Mr Noye's visits
would have been relatively short in duration, forming part of a day's routine
visits to the Classic dealership and other dealerships in his area.  Mr Noye
was, after all, only a sales representative and, in
my view, could not
realistically have been seen by Messrs Kevern or Purchall as having any
authority to bind Inchcape outside the
sphere of an ordinary salesman.  There
was some evidence given of an alleged occasion when Mr Purchall announced in Mr
Noye's presence,
in Mr Kevern's office, that he had run out of Inchcape
documentation and that Mr Noye then took him outside to Mr Noye's car and
gave
him documents from the car.  Mr Noye denies this, as he also denies having any
knowledge of Mr Purchall at all.  Mr Purchall
says that the relevant documents
were contract forms.  Ms Whyte says that they were application forms.  She
gives confused evidence
about the occurrence.  In her affidavit she speaks of
the documents being taken from the seat of the car.  In her oral testimony
she
speaks of them being taken from the boot.  In the end she said she was not
sure.  I think her evidence on the matter is unreliable.
 
<P>

92   	I was not satisfied, in general, with the evidence of Mr
Purchall.  I was unimpressed with the evidence of Mr Kevern.  The
evidence of
these witnesses fall far short of satisfying me as to the truth of their
allegations against Messrs Foster and Noye.
 I have not attempted to set out
all the evidence and issues of fact bearing on this.  However, I have
considered it all and nothing
therein deflects me from this view.
<P>

93   	I should add that the defendants placed reliance upon the
fact that there was an undoubted increase in business sent by Classic
to
Inchcape from the commencement of November 1997.  There is no doubt that this
increase was largely due to the introduction of
the Purchall transactions.  The
increase included vehicles, it was submitted, of a type that would not
ordinarily have been sold
by Classic, at prices which did not accord with the
usual prices of Classic's second hand vehicles, and at interest rates not
ordinarily
achieved in financial contracts with Classic's customers.  It is
submitted that these factors would have readily indicated to both
Mr Foster and
Mr Noye that the transactions were of a third party nature.  It was submitted
that their failure to realise the obvious
was indicative of the fact that they
already knew the transactions were third party Purchall deals.  These matters
were of course
put to them in cross-examination.  I do not think that the point
is a telling one.  Mr Thompson himself indicated that a variety
of vehicles
came to Classic by way of trade-ins, some of the vehicles being low quality.
Also his customer base was far wider than
the Sydney North Shore.  Moreover, as
Mr Foster pointed out, the increase in this retail business coincided with the
course of apparently
successful negotiations which he was conducting for the
purpose of widening Inchcape's business relations with Classic, at the expense
of AGC.  It would not be surprising to him if some of AGC's retail business was
being directed to Inchcape in this period.  Agreement
in principle, subject to
proper legal documentation, had been reached in October as shown by the
document Exhibit J signed by Mr
Thompson.  The defendants made a great deal of
the increase in business, the type of business, the type of customer and the
interest
rates in argument.  However, when viewed against the totality of the
evidence I am not prepared to attribute to it the weight that
they submit it
should be given.
<P>

94   	Moreover, as I have already mentioned, there was nothing
in the evidence to suggest that either Mr Foster or Mr Noye had anything
to
gain in orchestrating this plan of deception, as against what they stood to
lose.  Neither had the power to approve the transactions
within Inchcape, a
fact of which I am satisfied Mr Kevern and Mr Purchall would have been well
aware.  Neither could control the
ultimate outcome of any of the transactions.
If substantial default occurred in any one of the transactions, with the result
that
an enquiry would be made, it would readily come to light that the
transaction was not as represented.  This is precisely what occurred
when the
Jimmy Lee transaction was exposed in May 1998.  It is not really conceivable,
in my opinion, that either of these men would
have risked their jobs and their
career by entering into such a potentially dangerous situation from which they
had nothing substantial
to gain.  The evidence which has been offered falls far
short of satisfying me that they did.  
<P>

95   	Accordingly, in my view, the factual basis upon which
Classic seeks to defend the claim under s. 52 of the TPA has simply
not been
established.  Therefore the plaintiff must succeed.  I should add that, had I
been satisfied of the complicity of Messrs
Foster and Noye, there would,
nevertheless, have been considerable legal problems confronting the defendants.
Leaving aside the relatively
lowly position occupied by Mr Foster in the
decision-making hierarchy of Inchcape, there would have been a significant
question as
to whether he, having been involved in a fraudulent enterprise
against his employer, could infect the employer with knowledge of
that
enterprise.  I find it unnecessary to enter upon a consideration of the
authorities which have been cited to me, including the
decision of von Doussa
J. in <b>Beach Petroleum N.L. v Johnson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/283.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 283</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20115%20ALR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 115 ALR 411.</a>  The questions
considered by his Honour in that case simply do not arise here.  
<P>

96   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed
against Classic.  I turn now to the question of whether the second
defendant,
Mr Thompson, is also liable to the plaintiff, pursuant to s. 75B (1) of the
TPA.
<P>

<b>Liability of the second defendant</b>
<P>

I have already voiced some criticism of Mr Thompson as a witness.  I regarded
him, generally, as a poor witness.  He tended to be
argumentative and
unresponsive.  At times, when in a tight corner in cross-examination he
resorted to bluster.  To this extent he
did his cause little good.  He had
obviously fully embraced the concept that his company had been led into
difficulty and danger
through the machinations of Messrs Foster and Noye.  He
fairly regularly, in his evidence, imposed upon the cross-examiner and the
Court, by way of unresponsive assertion, the statement that "Inchcape knew all
about it."  His efforts to bolster Classic's case
against Inchcape by this
forensic behaviour were counter-productive.  However, it does not follow from
this that the case brought
against him personally must succeed.  It is a
significantly different case from that brought against the company.  Before
considering
the evidence, it is convenient to refer to the relevant
requirements of s. 75B (only part of the section is relied upon).  The headnote
to the leading case of <b>Yorke v Lucas</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20158%20CLR%20661" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 158 CLR 661</a> provides a
sufficient indication of the essential requirements of the section and its
relationship to other sections of the TPA.
which are relevant for present
purposes.  The headnote, relevantly, reads as follows:
<P>

"Section 52 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> 1974</a> (Cth) prohibits a
corporation from engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is
likely to mislead or deceive.
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 82</a> allows a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another
person that was done in contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 52</a> to recover the amount of the
loss or damage against that other person or against "any person involved in the
contravention".
<P>

Section 75B provides that a reference to a person involved in a contravention
shall be read as a reference to a person who - "(a)...;
(b)...; (c) has been in
any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the
contravention; or (d)...
<P>

<i>Held:</i>  (1)...
<P>

(2)   Before a person can be said to have been party to a contravention within
par. (c) of s. 75B, he must be an intentional participant,
the necessary intent
being based upon knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention.
<P>

<i>Per curiam</i>.  The word "knowingly" in par. (c) qualifies only the words
"concerned in" and not also the words `party to'."
<P>

97   	Reference to the majority judgment in the case (Mason ACJ,
Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ) indicates the accuracy of the headnote.
 It is not
necessary to cite from the judgment itself.  
<P>

98   	I am satisfied that the question for my determination is
whether Mr Thompson was concerned in the contravention that I have
held to be
established against Classic with knowledge of the essential elements of the
contravention.  Alternatively, was he an intentional
participant in that
contravention with knowledge of the essential elements of it.  I am also
satisfied that the knowledge in question
must be actual knowledge and not
constructive knowledge, except that if "wilful blindness" be established then
knowledge will be
imputed  (<b>Giorgianni v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 473).</a>

<P>

99   	The evidence satisfies me that, as a matter of practice,
Mr Thompson left the day to day running of the financial affairs
of Classic to
Mr Kevern, acting through Janafe Pty Limited.  Put simply, his position is that
after his initial discussion with Mr
Kevern about accepting Mr Purchall's third
party business and conducting it in accordance with Inchcape's requirements, he
took no
further part in either the setting-up of the arrangements or in their
conduct.  He became aware of problems only when the Jimmy Lee
matter was
brought to his attention.  Accordingly, it is submitted on his behalf that he
was not knowingly concerned in or party
to, any of Classic's contraventions.

<P>

100   	There is no evidence to indicate any participation by Mr
Thompson after his initial conversations with Mr Kevern and Mr Purchall.
 Those
conversations have already been referred to.  They did not contain any
information as to how the proposed transactions were
to be carried out.  There
is no evidence from Messrs Kevern and Purchall, Ms Whyte or any witnesses
called on behalf of the plaintiff
to indicate that Mr Thompson participated in
any way in the organisation of the transactions or in their conduct.  The
question,
therefore, in my opinion, is whether there is any other evidence in
the case which indicates that, without his actual participation
in the
transactions, he was nevertheless directly or indirectly aware that the conduct
of them involved Inchcape's being misled,
in the way that I have held.  
<P>

101   	To determine this question it is necessary to have regard
to the evidence of the conversations held with Mr Thompson after
the Jimmy Lee
problem had emerged and also of evidence given by him in these proceedings.

<P>

102   	The first conversation was with Mr Foster.  Evidence
relating to it was given by Mr Thompson and by Ms Whyte.  I consider
that Mr
Foster has a clearer recollection of it.  I accept his evidence.  The meeting
took place on 18 May 1998 at about 10.00 am.
 Mr Foster told Mr Thompson about
the problem with the account, that it was in arrears and that Jimmy Lee could
not be located. 
He asked for help.  Mr Thompson told Ms Whyte to bring in the
Classic file for Jimmy Lee.  She did so.  Mr Foster reviewed the file
and said
to Mr Thompson "What's this documentation in the file here?  We have no
documentation about this coming from a person by
the name of John Purchall."
Mr Thompson, who considered the file at that time, told Mr Foster that Mr
Purchall was forwarding business
to the dealership and that the Jimmy Lee
transaction was one forwarded by Mr Purchall and then on-forwarded to Inchcape.
Mr Foster
said that he was unaware that the transaction was of that nature and
Mr Thompson said that he would call John Purchall, which he
did.  He spoke to
Mr Purchall on the telephone and advised Mr Foster that Mr Purchall would
provide him with documentation relating
to the Jimmy Lee matter.  This was duly
done later in the day at Parramatta.
<P>

103   	After receiving the documentation from Mr Purchall, Mr
Foster had a further meeting with Mr Thompson that day.  He had a
discussion
with Mr Thompson and Ms Whyte as to the contents of the file, advising that it
contained material unknown to Inchcape.
 There is no need to set out the detail
of the Jimmy Lee transaction, which is complex, but the indication was clear
that it was
a very different form of transaction from what had been represented
to Inchcape.  
<P>

104   	The next person from Inchcape to speak to Mr Thompson
about the matter was Mr Grant.  I was impressed with Mr Grant as a
witness and
I fully accept his version of the conversation that occurred.  His evidence was
as follows:
<P>

"A.     I arrived at the showroom and Mr Thompson was downstairs
<P>

......   and he headed me towards a couple of seats downstairs and I
<P>

           said, "John, we need to talk about this, specifically about    
<P>

           the Jimmy Lee case, I think we should go to your office".  So
<P>

           we went upstairs to his office, where his wife joined the
<P>

           conversation.  I said, "John, it's about the Jimmy Lee case.
<P>

           It's obviously a fraudulent transaction", and he said, "Yes,
<P>

           I know".  He was gesticulating "I know, it's down to me, I'm    
<P>

           John Thompson, I'm an honourable man, I'll sort it out."
<P>

           And he said, "I cannot pay you the full $180,000, but I will
<P>

           be able to pay you $10,000 per month", and he said he'd even
<P>

           commence it in June.  I thanked him for his offer.  I said,
<P>

           "In order to show good faith to the other directors, I         
<P>

           would like to take back with me a cheque for the arrears on
<P>

           the account", which, from memory, was $9,566.  I asked him
<P>

           for that cheque and he said he would pay me that cheque, but
<P>

           could I collect it tomorrow, and I said, "No, seeing as I'm
<P>

           here and you and your wife are here, I would want to take       
<P>

           that cheque with me", and he was to prepare it, sign it, and
<P>

           hand it over.
<P>

Q.       Were there any discussions at that meeting about
<P>

           Mr Kevern or Miss Whyte?
<P>

A.       Yes, he had said that both Kevern and Whyte had been
<P>

           sacked.
<P>

Q.       Did he say anything else about them?
<P>

A.       He was pretty disparaging about both of them 
<P>

Q.       Could you try and give us the effect of what he said -
<P>

           if you can?
<P>

A.       He was as annoyed about the situation with Jimmy Lee as
<P>

           he was annoyed about David Kevern.  He felt that he'd been     
<P>

           duped by David Kevern."
<P>

105   	Mr Grant also said:
<P>

"A.       He was talking about how this could have happened in one
<P>

           of his dealerships - "I'm John Thompson" - he was huffing and
<P>

           puffing.  He was obviously very upset about the whole affair,
<P>

           and he just reiterated that he'd sacked Kevern and Whyte."      
<P>

106   	Mr Grant went on to say that Mr Thompson mentioned an
entity called Shola Finance.  Mr Thompson wanted Inchcape to take action
against Shola Finance because he was convinced that they were involved in the
whole fraud.  He said Mr Purchall was associated with
Shola Finance and wanted
to know what Mr Purchall's involvement in the Jimmy Lee case had been.  He was
annoyed that Mr Purchall
and Mr Kevern had dragged his good name down and he
was getting "hot and bothered about the possible effect on his reputation".
<P>

107   	I should mention at this stage that evidence in the case
indicates that Mr Purchall had a connection with an organisation
known as Shola
Finance which was a source of some of his transactions.
<P>

108   	Mr Grant also drew attention to the fact that the Jimmy
Lee deal contained an invoice from Classic.  He gave the following
evidence:
<P>

"A.	I said to John Thompson,
<P>

"Here is the invoice for the Jimmy Lee case, detailing the person and the
goods and the price."  
<P>

I said it was obvious that this had come from Chatswood and that was one of the
reasons that we had actually done the deal."
<P>

109   	Mr Grant indicated that he showed Mr Thompson the
invoice.  He said that Mr Thompson was very emotional and gesticulated
with his
arms in the air saying again, "I'm John Thompson.  I'm an honourable man.  It's
down to me.  We'll sort it out."
<P>

110   	Mr Grant received the cheque that he had asked for and
said that he would fax to Mr Thompson details of the repayment method
that had
been suggested, namely that repayment be made on the 10th of each month,
commencing on 10 June 1998, until the full amount
was repaid.  He also said
that he would visit Mr Thompson when a letter to this effect had been prepared,
in order that Mr Thompson
might sign it.  He then left, taking the cheque with
him.
<P>

111   	Mr Thompson gave a somewhat different version of this
conversation.  He said that it was all hedged around with the word
"if".  He
would make a payment only "if" it was established that Classic was liable.  I
regret to say that I do not accept Mr Thompson's
version.  He may well have
come to believe it, but I think it is a product of wishful thinking.  However,
I consider that what he
was shown in the Jimmy Lee material, including the
invoice from Classic, was a revelation to him.  It indicated the way in which
the Purchall transactions, which he had authorised, had in fact been carried
out.  It was also an indication to him that Inchcape
had been misled and had
certainly not agreed to the transactions being carried out in the way they
were.  I am satisfied, although
he later sought to resile in part from his
statement, that Mr Thompson had sacked both Mr Kevern and Ms Whyte because of
this.  Mr
Kevern was rather evasive on this subject but Ms Whyte, in her
evidence, quite clearly accepted that their employment had been terminated
upon
the emergence of the Jimmy Lee problem.  
<P>

112   	I am also satisfied from the contents of this
conversation that Mr Thompson had formed the view on the material which he
had
seen, that he had been duped by Mr Kevern and by Mr Purchall.  I consider that
his handing over of the cheque was a clear indication
that he was satisfied, on
the basis of what he had seen, that Inchcape had been misled by Messrs Kevern
and Purchall, in circumstances
where Classic had been rendered liable to
Inchcape.  
<P>

113   	Mr Grant prepared the letter, which became Exhibit P.  It
amounted to an acknowledgment of liability on the part of Classic
and an
undertaking to repay the amount involved by instalments.  The letter was faxed
to Mr Thompson and Mr Grant then rang him to
make an appointment to see him on
11 June.  He gives the following account of the telephone conversation, which I
accept:
<P>

"A.	I rang him and said that - I'd already faxed the letter through to him and
I rang him to make an appointment to see him, and
he said:
<P>

"Look, I've changed my mind, I am not happy with the amount of effort that you
are putting into this case to actually recover the
money".  
<P>

He reiterated the point that if push came to shove, he would pay the money by
instalments, as he'd already agreed to, but that he
wanted to take more legal
action to try and recover the money.  He wanted to put an advert in the local
paper saying "Dial this number,
$5,000 reward for finding this vehicle".  And
he said that he knew some people in the police that he could ring up and try
and find
out exactly where the car was and just give them some money."
<P>

114   	Mr Grant went to see Mr Thompson in the afternoon of that
day.  Mr Grant gives the following account of the meeting, which
I accept:
<P>

"A.  I turned up at the meeting - I turned up at the dealership at about 5
o'clock.  I said to John:
<P>

"I need to see you about this letter that I have faxed through to you".
<P>

He had a copy of it and it was in his office and we went to his office and he
was holding the letter saying - gesticulating,
<P>

"I want you to - I want you to pursue Jimmy Lee legally.  I want you to get the
fraud squad on to Jimmy Lee.  I don't want to have
to pay for this and for then
you not to do anything about it."
<P>

And I said,
<P>

"Well, at our previous meeting you had held your hands up, it's down to me, I'm
John Thompson, I'm an honourable man and you agreed,
it was your suggestion,
the $20,000 a month because you couldn't afford anything more, so we agreed to
$20,000 a month, you were
to sign it, and that was the arrangement, John."
<P>

And he said:
<P>

"No, I'm not prepared to sign it.  I want to take some other action.  I will
help you do it but I don't want to sign this letter.
 In fact, I regret giving
you the $9,500.""
<P>

115   	Mr Grant told Mr Thompson that it looked as though there
were other cases of a similar nature to the Jimmy Lee case.  Mention
was made
of the Reiko matter, one of the transactions in dispute.  Mr Grant advised that
there was another investigation going on
about that.  Mr Thompson was
emotional.  He reiterated that Mr Kevern had been sacked and said that he
wanted to take action against
Mr Kevern as well.  He also said that Mr Kevern
had told him that "Rob Foster knew all about this."  Mr Grant denied that Mr
Foster
had any knowledge of the matter.  Mr Thompson said he would make
enquiries and offer a reward for information, which he, in fact,
did.
<P>

116   	Again, I accept Mr Grant's version of this conversation
in preference to that of Mr Thompson.  Mr Thompson's version, as
sworn in the
witness box, was, in my view, unconvincing.  However, again, what Mr Thompson
said was indicative of a lack of knowledge
on his part as to what Messrs Kevern
and Purchall had been doing.  I infer that, after the previous conversation
with Mr Grant, there
must have been a conversation between him and Mr Kevern,
or someone on Mr Kevern's behalf, in which Mr Kevern's self-exculpatory
explanation, namely that it had all been done with the knowledge of Mr Foster,
had been expounded.  Unfortunately, it would appear
that Mr Thompson embraced
this explanation, with the result that Classic's defence in these proceedings
has been based upon the evidence
of Messrs Kevern and Purchall and Ms Whyte.

<P>

117   	I find it unnecessary to refer further to the evidence of
Mr Thompson.  Much of it demonstrated that he had become obsessed
with the idea
that Messrs Foster and Noye were at fault.  However, it had an underlying theme
which I accept, namely that he believed
that Messrs Kevern and Purchall would
make arrangements that were acceptable to Inchcape, that being the clear
instruction he had
given.  Also, I accept his evidence that he would not be a
party, himself, to anything that was deceptive.
<P>

118   	In the upshot, I have come to the firm conclusion that
although, undoubtedly, Mr Thompson should have been aware of what
was going on
in the Purchall transactions, he was not.  He left it to Messrs Kevern and
Purchall to make sure that the deals were
safe and proper and in accordance
with Inchcape's requirements.  I am satisfied that he had no indication that
anything was wrong
until the sudden emergence of the Jimmy Lee matter.  His
first reaction was the proper one, namely to accept liability on behalf
of
Classic.  Unfortunately, it appears that he was induced to change his mind.
This fact, however, does not establish that he relevantly
knew anything about
the true nature of the transactions while they were taking place.
<P>

119   	In these circumstances I dismiss the plaintiff's claim
against Mr Thompson.  However, having regard to all the circumstances
of this
case, I do not think it appropriate to award him his costs.  
<P>

120   	<b>Damages</b>
<P>

I turn then to the question of damages.  I do not find it necessary to review
the plaintiff's evidence on damages.  I am quite satisfied
to accept the
material that has been placed before me by way of affidavit evidence.  I accept
that the principle used in the calculation
of the damages is appropriate,
namely that the plaintiff should recover from Classic, with interest, all of
the monies, including
payments of commission, which it outlaid in respect of
the twenty-one transactions, less any amounts it has received or recovered
in
respect of them.  A Schedule has been put before me on behalf of the plaintiff
which sets out the relevant details of each transaction
including the nature of
the transaction as it was made to appear and what the transaction in fact was.
The Schedule includes a calculation
of damages, including interest, in respect
of all the transactions which have been finalised either by the recovery of the
vehicle
in question or its being written off.  In some cases, however, the
transaction has not been finalised because there is some prospect
of the
vehicle being recovered.  I have been asked to approach those cases, by both
sides, on the basis of making a discount rather
than making some order for
indemnity against future loss.  I think that this is an appropriate course in
the circumstances.  I hold
that a discount of 50% should be allowed in respect
of those particular matters.  
<P>

121   	The Schedule, together with an additional document
prepared by the plaintiff which indicates the matters in respect of which
I
have held that the discount should apply, will be retained in the Court file.

<P>

122   	It will be necessary for a re-calculation of damages to
be effected, taking into account the discounts and also bringing
up to date the
calculations of interest.
<P>

123   	I consider it appropriate that the plaintiff should have
the general costs of the action.  Accordingly, I order the first
defendant to
pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

124   	I direct that the parties bring in Short Minutes based
upon these reasons.  I list the matter for the purpose of taking those
Short
Minutes on 16 September 1999 at 10.00 am.
