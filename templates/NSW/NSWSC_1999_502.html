FRIDAY 16 APRIL 1999
<P>

<b>1494/99 - MARVEL CORPORATION PTY LTD v. MICHAEL ANDREW FISHER</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	MASTER:  This is an application to set aside a statutory demand dated 3
February 1999.  The application has been brought in time
and the demand claims
two sums payable by the plaintiff to the defendant.  The first sum is $5,634.88
in respect of loans said to
be made by the defendant to the plaintiff and the
second is $75,303.83 which is said to be payable consequent upon the
termination
of the employment of the defendant with the plaintiff.
<P>

2		The defendant commenced employment with the plaintiff as finance
administration manager with the company on 8 August 1997.  There
is a letter
setting out the terms of that employment.  The defendant's employment was
terminated on 19 January 1999, according to
the defendant, on the grounds that
the plaintiff took the view that he had made unauthorised transfers of funds to
himself personally.
<P>

3		The application to set aside is made on two grounds:  firstly, that there is
a defect in the affidavit accompanying the demand
and secondly that there is a
genuine dispute in any event.  The affidavit accompanying the demand is that of
the plaintiff sworn
3 February 1999.  That affidavit deals with the loans and
also the payments by the defendant from the company itself in his position
as
finance manager, the termination of the contract, the grounds for termination
and the amount claimed.
<P>

4		Under Part 88 rule 15 of the Supreme Court Rules there are requirements for
the contents of the affidavit accompanying a demand.
 In particular, rule
15(1)(d) and (e) requires a statement by the demand that the amount is due and
owing and secondly a statement
by the deponent that there is no genuine
dispute.
<P>

5		There is one other defect in the demand and that is that it does not have
the 'important note' which must be attached to the
affidavit.  In the
circumstances of this case that is not a sufficient defect under section
459J(1)(b) to set aside the demand. 
This is well established that a defect in
an affidavit accompanying may lead to the demand being set aside and it is not
necessary
in such a case to prove substantial injustice, which is required
under section 459J(1)(a).  See <b>Spencer Constructions v. Aldridge</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/681.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 681</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2076%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997)
76 FCR 452</a> and <b>Kezarne Pty Ltd v. Sydney Asbestos Removal Services Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=29%20ACSR%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">29 ACSR 11.</a>
<P>

6		The matter which is of importance is the absence of a statement that there
is a belief of no genuine dispute.  In <b>B&amp;M Quality Constructions Pty Ltd
v Buyrite Steel Supplies Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%2088" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 88</a> his Honour McLelland J
referred to the importance of this statement as a significant mechanism in the
hearing of statutory demands
for filtering out cases where there is a genuine
dispute.
<P>

7		In the present case it is perfectly obvious on the plaintiff's own affidavit
that he was likely to have been aware that there
was a dispute.  He was called
in and his employment terminated for making unauthorised payments which he said
he was authorised to
make.  This is clearly the type of case where it would be
inappropriate for such a matter to be omitted.  Whether it is omitted by
the
solicitor or by the deponent, I find that in the circumstances there must have
been a dispute.  Accordingly it seems to me that
this is an appropriate ground
for setting aside the demand.
<P>

8		There was also a ground raised that the affidavit supporting the demand did
not specify in detail the way in which the amounts
claimed to be due on
termination of the employment were calculated.  The specification of such
matters were given in later affidavits.
 
<P>

9		By itself I would not necessary set aside the demand on this ground given
the absence of any other evidence in the matter.  However
even in this case it
seems to me that there is a genuine dispute.  There are in fact two amounts,
one concerning a loan and it seems
clear that there is at least an arguable
case on the affidavit evidence that the repayment of that loan is not due until
the granting
of an export grant.  The balance of the amount is to do with the
employment and amounts payable upon termination.
<P>

10		There seem to be a number of different amounts claimed.  The first amount
is the sum claimed to be due under clause 2 of the
contract of employment,
being a statutory superannuation payment.  Probably there is no dispute that
that amount is $6,650.  The
other amount under clause 5 I would have thought
was payable and particularly the next amount is payable under clause 6.
<P>

11		However, in view of my conclusion in relation to defects in the affidavit,
I do propose to set aside the demand.
<P>

12		Accordingly, I make order 1 in the summons and order 2 in the summons.
<P>
