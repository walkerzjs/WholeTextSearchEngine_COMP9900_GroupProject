<b>JUDGMENT (Contextual imputations - capacity - form - discovery and
inspection - interrogatories)</b>
<P>

1   	To the first publication complained of in addition to
pleading a defence pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a> </i>the
defendants have pleaded the following contextual imputations <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 16):</a>
<P>

<i>"8(i)	the plaintiffs were guilty of profiteering at the expense of the
Australian government;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the plaintiffs were lining their pockets with taxpayers' monies for
doing very little; and</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	the plaintiffs compounded their rort of the government by using
translators without the qualifications and credentials to translate
government
advertising".</i>
<P>

2   	With respect to the second publication complained of by the
plaintiffs the defendants have pleaded the following contextual
imputations:
<P>

<i>"9(i)	the plaintiffs were guilty of profiteering at the expense of the
Australian government;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the plaintiffs were taking money from the taxpayers in a `rort' and
giving little in return; and</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	the plaintiffs compounded their `rort' by the way they charged for
their translating services in that they used translators
who had no
professional credibility".</i>
<P>

3   	The plaintiffs contend that the matters complained of are
incapable as a matter of law of conveying these contextual imputations.
 In my
judgment of 30 April 1999 (NSWSC 390:  DLJ: 6) I commented upon the
difficulties confronting both parties arising from the
language used in the
original letter in English, that is, the first matter complained of and the
second publication and its translation
(the second matter complained of)
(paragraph 10).
<P>

4   	Insofar as any of the contextual imputations pleaded by the
defendants are unsuccessfully attacked by the plaintiff they will
be available
as defences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> in respect of publication in New South Wales
(<b><i>Chakravarti v Adelaide Newspapers Limited</i></b> (1998) 193 CLR 519 at
pars 8-12 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J).
<P>

5   	Any notion of expense to the Australian government I am
persuaded is incapable of arising from the matter complained of in
either of
its forms.  I am not therefore concerned with any nice question of form in
relation to the use of "<i>profiteering"</i> in contextual imputation 8(i).
<P>

6   	Accordingly, contextual imputations 8(i) and (iii) I find
to be incapable of being conveyed by the first matter complained
of.
<P>

7   	As to contextual imputation 8(ii) the argument in the usual
way is advanced - "<i>what does it mean?"</i>  The imputation is founded in the
very language of this publication.  It is discrete in form and in my view,
capable of being understood
as a series of ordinary English words.
<P>

8   	Contextual imputation 8(ii) will go to the jury.
<P>

9   	For reasons stated contextual imputation 9(i) I find to be
incapable of being conveyed by the matter complained of.  
<P>

10   	As to contextual imputations 9(ii) and (iii) it is to be
noted that they each contain the word "<i>rort</i>" in the form (that is, in
inverted commas) as used in the translation of the second matter complained of.
Nothing according to the
arguments for the plaintiff turns on this curiosity.
I am certainly of the view that the word "<i>rort</i>" in any event is one in
such general usage as to have a natural and ordinary meaning to ordinary
reasonable readers (cf.  <b><i>Young &amp; Ors v Munro &amp; Anor</i></b>
(Levine J, unreported, 12 May 1995)).  It does not fall within that class of
"<i>colloquialisms"</i> which it seems are proscribed as components of
imputations.
<P>

11   	Contextual imputation 9(ii) will go to the jury.
<P>

12   	Contextual imputation 9(iii) will be struck out.  I do not
understand it.  I do not understand the notion of "<i>compounding</i>" the
rort.  When one reads the matter complained of the recipient is being invited
to consider the credibility of the persons the
second plaintiff employs as
translators as evidence of the existence of the rort and not something that
either aggravates it, compounds
it or increases it.  This contextual imputation
is struck out as bad in form.
<P>

13   	I do not propose to grant the automatic leave that is
usually granted to a pleader in circumstances of the kind with which
I have
just dealt.  This matter is listed for trial on 1 November.  The defendant will
no doubt consider the status of the remnants
of their contextual imputations
particularly in the light of the plea of justification they have on the record
in relation to the
plaintiff's imputations.
<P>

14   	If the defendants propose further to seek leave they will
have to formally move the Court.
<P>

15   	The balance of the dispute between the parties appears to
be concerned with discovery, inspection, a Notice to Produce and
failure to
answers interrogatories.
<P>

16   	In relation to a Notice to Produce said to have been
served by the defendants upon the plaintiffs no call has ever been made
on this
Notice and thus there is no present need to determine any question in regard
thereto.
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=17%20Page%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">17   	Page 11</a> of the transcript of proceedings before me on 13
August 1999 indicate that I have granted leave to the parties to inspect such
documents
as are in the Registry in response to subpoenas and in respect of
which no claim for privilege is made.
<P>

18   	Thus I have made Order 4 in the Notice of Motion filed in
Court on 25 July 1999 by the solicitor for the defendants.
<P>

19   	Order 2 of that Notice of Motion requires that the
plaintiffs require documents sought pursuant to a Notice to Produce dated
14
January 1999.  As I have said until a call is made upon that Notice there is no
obligation upon the plaintiff so to do.  That
disposes of Order 2.
<P>

20   	The first order sought in the Notice of Motion is that the
plaintiffs provide <i>"further and better discovery of the documents listed in
the Affidavit pursuant to Pt 23 r 7 of ...</i>".
<P>

21   	An affidavit by the defendants' solicitor, Mr Tony
Lazaropoulos, sworn 23 June 1999 was filed in Court on 5 June 1999.  It
has
never been read.  I therefore have no regard to it.  I am informed and accept
for the purposes of whatever mechanism is available
for the disposition of the
Notice of Motion and any other dispute between the parties that the plaintiffs
have delivered lists of
documents on 30 October 1997 and 30 April 1998 and in
February of this year.  This is in the context, as I understand it, from the
material provided to me after argument on 13 August of the particularisation by
the defendants of its pleas of justification in communications
dated 24
November 1998, 5 January 1999, 21 January 1999, 5 February 1999, 10 June 1999
and 12 August 1999.  
<P>

22   	In the written material provided to me by counsel for both
sides there appears to be disputes as to the nature and extent
of inspection
that has taken place or not taken place, the conditions sought to be attached
to it and so on.
<P>

23   	The plaintiffs contend, for example, in relation to their
list of documents served in February this year, that documents C34
to C36
contain confidential information "<i>in relation to which the plaintiffs
require Court orders or undertakings before those documents are disclosed to
the defendants legal
advisers". </i> It is stated (not by way of evidence on
the part of the plaintiffs or their solicitors), that neither the defendants
solicitors nor
counsel have made any further requests for access to these
documents.  
<P>

24   	This exemplifies the situation that can only be resolved
if there is a formal request for access and it is denied and the
Court is moved
in a formal way to enable the determination of the issue of whether the
confidentiality is such as to preclude inspection
even by the defendants legal
advisers.  This procedure will have to be followed in relation to the mass of
material on the one hand
asserted to be unavailable, on the other said to have
been inspected.  This course will focus upon a matter that was mentioned during
the course of argument that may be of legitimate concern to the plaintiffs.  It
is tolerably clear that the parties are commercial
rivals.  The solicitor on
the record for the defendant is an "<i>in-house</i>" solicitor for the
defendants and thus there is concern, which I take to be not directed to Mr
Lazaropoulos in a personal sense,
but rather by reason of his employment
status, that information of a confidential commercial nature might fall into
the hands of
the defendants.  I gather from Ms Gibson that undertakings have
been given by herself in relation to sensitive commercial material
in fact made
available.  The point has been reached where I frankly do not see it as a
necessary task for me to perform to go through
the voluminous submissions and
documents which have been handed up to me to make specific orders in relation
to anything that might
range from a "<i>job order</i>" to taxation returns.
The parties have had nearly two years to get this action ready for trial and I
say that taking into account
judgments that have been delivered since February
1998 and the process of discovery to some extent embarked upon by the parties
in
the meantime.  
<P>

25   	The pleadings (taking into account the ruling at the
commencement of these reasons) and the supply of particulars describe
the ambit
of the issues between the parties against which any question of relevance can
be judged.  The parties presently are in
a far better position than I am to
wade their through their own papers to determine that ambit and thus any
question of relevance.
<P>

26   	Mr Littlemore Q.C. rightfully remarked during the course
of argument that unless questions relating to discovery, inspection
and
interrogatories are resolved by the trial, things will have to be done the
"<i>long and hard way</i>" namely by cross-examination of Mr Assaf (on the
assumption that he is called, of course), which may take days.
<P>

27   	The material provided to me after submissions (and I
acknowledge at my request), still provides no evidentiary or proper basis
for
me to make an order of the kind sought in Order 1 of the Notice of Motion and I
decline to do so.
<P>

28   	Order 3 in the Notice of Motion relation to the provision
of access said to be pursuant to SCR Pt 23 r 11 which merely provides
for a
party to whom a document is produced for inspection being able to make a copy
of that document.  A party may make a copy if
the party giving discovery and
permitting inspection objects to the copying of documents, then the Court
should be moved in a formal
way for appropriate relief.  A generalised order of
the kind sought in paragraph 3 of the Notice of Motion cannot particularly in
the circumstances of this case be either fair or of any utility as far as I can
understand it.  I decline to make Order 3.
<P>

29   	A point has been reached where if the defendants are
justifiably aggrieved by what they assert to be the conduct of the plaintiffs
and if the defendants can correlate that sense of grievance in a formal,
succinct clear way (by reference to identified particulars,
identifiable
documents and the like), then they should do so.  The mechanism of the subpoena
should not be overlooked.  
<P>

30   	I turn now to the dispute (of the usual kind) in relation
to interrogatories.  I have had the benefit of written submissions
in chief, in
response and in reply from counsel for the parties.
<P>

31   	I observe that I am not persuaded that as a result of the
judgment delivered on 30 April 1999 that there has been such a shift
in issues
underpinning the pleas of justification as to warrant a repeated assertion of
lack of relevance on such a basis.  I accept
the submissions for the defendant
as to the substance of the imputations (pleaded by the plaintiff) which the
defendants are justifying
and reject the plaintiffs contentions as to the
irrelevance of "<i>costs components</i>", "<i>qualifications</i>" and
"<i>rates"</i>.  As far as interrogatories relate to contextual imputations
held to be unavailable there will be no requirement to provide further
answers.
<P>

32   	I accept the plaintiffs objection on the basis of
oppression in relation to interrogatory 9.
<P>

33   	Accordingly, the plaintiffs will be directed to provide
further answers to interrogatories 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11.  The
basis of
objection in relation to the last mentioned interrogatory, in the context of
the conduct of this litigation, is really specious.
<P>

34   	As to the costs of the argument on 13 August, the balance
of success will be reflected in an order that each side pays it
own costs.
<P>

35   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Contextual imputations 8(i), 8(iii) and 9(i) will not go to the jury.
<P>

2.	Contextual imputations 8(ii) and 9(ii) will go to the jury.
<P>

3.	Contextual imputation 9(iii) is struck out.
<P>

4.	As to the defendants' Notice of Motion:
<P>

(a)	I make Order 4; 
<P>

(b)	Orders 1, 2 and 3 are refused;  
<P>

(c)	otherwise the Motion is dismissed.
<P>

5.	The plaintiffs are ordered to deliver, within 14 days, further verified
answers to interrogatories 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11.
<P>

6.	Each party is to pay its own costs of the Notice of Motion and proceedings
on 13 August 1999.
<P>

7.	  Liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 7 days notice.
<P>
