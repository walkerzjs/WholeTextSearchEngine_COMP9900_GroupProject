1	<b>MASTER:</b>  These are two proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</i> 1982</a>.
<P>

2	By summons filed on 7 April 1997 Christine Anne Croucher and Nina Tracey
Beilby each claims an order for provision for her maintenance,
education and
advancement in life out of the estate and/or the notional estate of their late
father, Christopher John Croucher (to
whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

3	By summons filed on 22 September 1998 Diane Joan Croucher, the widow of the
deceased, also claims an order for provision for her
maintenance and
advancement in life out of the estate and/or the notional estate of the
deceased.
<P>

4	The parties were content that the two proceedings should be heard together
and that the evidence in the one, so far as was relevant,
should be treated as
evidence in the other (although no formal order had been made to such
effect).
<P>

5	At the commencement of the hearing Counsel for the plaintiffs informed the
Court that Nina Tracey Beilby, the first named plaintiff,
had elected to
discontinue her proceedings, and the Court was invited, in due  course, to make
an order dismissing her claim.
<P>

6	The deceased died on 3 November 1996. He left a will dated 18 June 1993,
probate whereof was on 22 June 1997 granted to Diane
Joan Croucher, the
executor named in such will (to whom I shall refer as "Joan" or "the
widow").
<P>

7	The deceased, who was aged forty-nine at the time of his death, had married
twice. 
<P>

8	Of his first marriage, in 1968 to Denise Gilbert, were born three children,
Nina Tracey (born 17 July 1968, who is presently aged
30), Christine Anne (born
28 April 1971, who is presently aged 28), and Mark (who died, as a result of a
motor accident, in May 1988).

<P>

9	The deceased separated from his first wife in 1983, and they were divorced in
the following year. On 4 January 1984 the deceased
and Diane commenced living
together, and they married on 9 November 1985.
<P>

10	Of the deceased's marriage to Diane was born one child, Emma (born 14 July
1989) who is presently aged nine.
<P>

11	By clause 2 of his will (which appears to have been prepared by the deceased
personally, and to come within the provisions of
section 18A of the <i>Wills,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act </i>1898</a>) the deceased, in the events which have
happened, gave the following assets to his three children, Nina, Christine and
Emma in equal
shares as tenants in common;
<P>

	The proceeds of my life insurance (National Mutual), investment account with
the AMP Society, my superannuation, death benefits
and any moneys owing to me
by my employer (Ferntree Computer Corporation) and my share of the property
known as 5 Shaw Street, Saratoga
NSW.
<P>

12	Clause 2 further provided,
<P>

	If any of my children have not completed their schooling, then an adequate
amount should be allocated from each of the shares equally
to cover this cost.
Any moneys owing on the mortgage of the property known as 52 Renwick Street,
Leichhardt, should also be taken
from the above money.
<P>

13	The will then gave the residue of the estate to Diane. 
<P>

14	The inventory of property filed in respect to the application for probate of
the will of the deceased disclosed the following
assets
<P>

	Undivided half share as tenant in common in property situate at and known as
52 Renwick Street, Leichhardt, having an estimated
value of $135,000
<P>

	Undivided half share as tenant in common in property situate at and known as
5/9 Nelson Street, Penshurst, having an estimated
value of $80,000
<P>

	Undivided one-sixth share as tenant in common in property situate at and known
as 5 Shaw Street, Saratoga, having an estimated
value of $20,000
<P>

	Moneys in bank accounts - $5,515
<P>

	Shares in companies - $1,721
<P>

	Salary and leave entitlements - $18,465
<P>

	Life policy (Australian Mutual Providence Society) - $28,428
<P>

	Loan insurance - $17,280
<P>

	Refund of premium on superannuation policy - $108
<P>

15	It should be noted that the deceased at the time of his death held no assets
coming within the descriptions in clause 2 of his
will "proceeds of my life
insurance (National Mutual), investment account with the AMP Society". However
an AMP Society - Benefit
Preservation Plan (in an amount of $624) and a
National Mutual Retirement Fund Policy (in an amount of $23,596) are disclosed
by
the executor as notional estate of the deceased. The former amount has been
paid to the three children equally. The benefit under
the National Mutual
policy (in an amount of $27,600) is to be paid directly to Diane.
<P>

16	At the time of his death the liabilities of the deceased consisted of
indebtedness to unsecured creditors totalling $5,850. In
addition, the deceased
had a mortgage account with Citibank in the sum of $166,467 (secured by
mortgages over the properties at Leichhardt
and at Penshurst), and, in
addition, a secured loan from Community First Credit Union in the sum of
$17,280.
<P>

17	It should here be noted that the other undivided half share as tenant in
common in each of the properties at 52 Renwick Street,
Leichhardt (which was
the matrimonial home of the deceased at the time of his death), and at 5/9
Nelson Street, Penshurst, was held
by Diane. In consequence, therefore, of the
gift to her of the residue of the estate, Diane has become the owner of the
entirety
of each of those two properties. By the time of the hearing the half
interest in the Renwick Street property had increased to $160,000,
and the half
interest in the Nelson Street house unit had increased to $90,000. Diane and
Emma have continued to reside in the Renwick
Street residence since the death
of the deceased. (Diane did not contribute to the purchase price of either of
the two properties,
and all payments on the mortgage loan from Citibank were
made by the deceased during his lifetime.)
<P>

18	The deceased at the time of his death had a superannuation entitlement from
the Kingly Staff Superannuation Fund. Diane, as the
widow of the deceased, made
a submission to the trustee of that fund that the entirety of the entitlement
of the deceased in that
fund, in an amount of $219,556, should be paid directly
to her as widow of the deceased. Eventually, the trustee decided that that
entitlement should be paid, not directly to the widow, but to the estate of the
deceased. The widow objected to that decision, which
the trustee subsequently
ratified. The widow then lodged with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal an
objection to the decision
of the trustee. 
<P>

19	The legal status of that Tribunal was under question, and, ultimately, the
widow, rather than await the outcome of a challenge
in the High Court of
Australia to the status of that Tribunal and then (if the Tribunal still
continued in existence) pursue her
objection against the decision of the
trustee, chose to institute proceedings 4000 of 1998 and claim from the estate
of the deceased
an order for provision in addition to that given to her by the
will of the deceased. Before doing so, however, Diane had already
received from
the superannuation trustee a total of $20,000 (by way of two separate payments
of $10,000 each, made on account of
hardship, the first payment being made in
June 1997, the second in July 1998).
<P>

20	In consequence of the decision of the trustee to pay the superannuation
entitlement of the deceased to his estate, rather than
directly to his widow,
the destination of that asset in the estate is now governed by the provisions
of clause 2 of the will. The
effect of that clause is that (subject to the
qualification relating to the provision for schooling --- Emma is the only
child who
is entitled to benefit from that provision --- and subject to the
qualification concerning the discharge of the mortgage on the Renwick
Street
property) the following assets of the estate should be held for the three
children of the deceased equally:
<P>

	Salary and leave entitlements - $18,465
<P>

	Superannuation, death benefits - $219,556
<P>

	Interest in property situate at and known as 5 Shaw Street, Saratoga -
$20,000
<P>

	TOTAL $258,021
<P>

21	Evidence was placed before the Court on behalf of Diane concerning the cost
of education of Emma, who is presently in Year 4
at Wenona, at North Sydney.
That evidence discloses that the future cost of schooling for Emma from the
beginning of 1998 until the
expected achievement by her of the Higher School
Certificate at Wenona will total $169,901. Further, the amount of the
outstanding
mortgage loan on the deceased's interest in the Renwick Street
property was $11,051.
<P>

22	Adopting for the present the foregoing figures, it follows, therefore, that
from the assets of the estate referred to in clause
2 of the will there must be
deducted an amount of about $181,000 before the balance is distributed among
the three children of the
deceased, being Nina, Christine and Emma.
Accordingly, upon those figures, the effect of that distribution will be that
each of the
three children of the deceased will receive about $26,000.
<P>

23	For practical purposes Diane, as executor, will retain the sum of about
$170,000, for the future school education of Emma, and
will also retain the sum
of $11,051 in respect of the liability of the deceased under the mortgage on
the Renwick Street property.
(A payment in that latter amount was, in fact,
made to Citibank on 1 April 1998, the source of that payment being the
deceased's
mortgage loan insurance.) That property was the family home of the
deceased, Diane and Emma at the time of the death of the deceased.
In addition,
Diane will become the absolute owner of the Renwick Street property and of the
Nelson Street home unit (which latter
is an investment property, producing
income). She retains the National Mutual Retirement Policy ($23,596) and also a
Ford Fairmont
motor car (to which she ascribes a value of $11,000).
<P>

24	Christine is employed as a superannuation fund administrator by Prudential
Corporation. She receives a net income, after tax,
of $634 a week. She is
currently living in a de facto relationship with Robbie Abony, who is also
employed by Prudential Corporation,
as an administrator, and who receives a net
income of $604 a week. They are intending to marry in 1999, and estimate that
the cost
of their wedding will be between $15,000 and $20,000.
<P>

25	Apart from some furniture, Christine's only asset is a 1992 Daihatsu Charade
motor car. She presently has liabilities totalling
about $10,700. Evidence was
placed before the Court concerning the weekly outgoings of Christine and her
partner. Those outgoings
include a total of $100 a week for cigarettes and a
total of $150 a week for entertainment. 
<P>

26	Diane is employed on a part-time basis, two days a week, as a professional
development co-ordinator by Mallesons Stephen Jaques,
solicitors. The
arrangement as to her days and hours of work (which suits Emma's schooling) has
been in place for the past five or
six years. For that employment she receives
$18,296 (gross) a year. She also receives by way of income a family allowance
of $3,660
(gross) a year (from Centrelink).
<P>

27	In addition to her interest as tenant in common with the deceased in the
house property at Renwick Street, Leichhardt, in which
she resides with Emma,
and her interest as tenant in common in the home unit at Penshurst (from which
she receives rental income
of $5,359 a year), the assets of Diane include the
furnishings and contents of the Renwick Street residence, together with her
personal
effects. It should be observed that the furnishings of the house
property include some items of antique furniture, to which Diane
ascribed an
estimated value of between $20,000 and $25,000, and that her personal effects
include jewellery, to which she ascribed
an estimated value of $2,500. (Neither
of those categories of assets were included in the list of her assets set forth
in her affidavit
evidence; but evidence of those additional assets emerged only
under cross-examination at the hearing). 
<P>

28	In her affidavit of 1 December 1998 in proceedings 4000 of 1998 Diane sets
forth details of her current financial and material
circumstances. Those
details include a schedule of liabilities, totalling $35,723. However, that
schedule of liabilities includes
$4,261 in respect to provision for education
expenses of Emma for terms 3 and 4, 1998, an item which under the provisions of
clause
2 of the will is entitled to be deducted from the fund established under
that clause. Other items amongst those current liabilities
are the amount of
$11,051 shown as a mortgage loan over the Renwick Street residence, owing to
Citibank, personal loans totalling
$14,099, an outstanding HECS debt of $931,
and various credit card indebtednesses totalling $5,380. 
<P>

29	The amount of $27,600 which will be paid directly to Diane from NM
Superannuation Pty Limited, being the National Mutual Retirement
Fund, will be
almost sufficient to discharge the foregoing debts (apart from that in respect
to Emma's education, which should be
borne by the fund established under clause
2 of the will). 
<P>

30	That affidavit of 1 December 1998 also has annexed to it details of Diane's
current annual income, which discloses that her total
net income is $22,395.

<P>

31	One of the components of that income is the amount of $5,395, being a one
half share of the rental income on the Penshurst home
unit. It will be
appreciated that, since the death of the deceased, Diane is entitled to the
entirety of the rental on that home
unit, and that, in consequence, her income
from that source will now be $10,718 a year. Thus, after provision is made for
income
tax on that  additional income, Diane's total net income will increase
by about $4,000, to about $26,400. She will, in addition,
have a capital fund
comprising part of the residue of the estate, which should, if invested,
produce a further increase in her annual
income. 
<P>

32	Christine, as a daughter of the deceased, is an eligible person within
paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, she has the standing to bring her
present proceedings. Diane also, as the widow of the deceased, is an eligible
person,
within paragraph (a) of that definition. As such, she also has the
standing to bring her present proceedings. 
<P>

33	I have already observed that Christine (in common with her sister Nina and
her half sister Emma) under the terms of the will
receives from her father's
estate the sum of $26,000. Apart from those three amounts (totalling about
$58,600) the entirety of the
estate passes to Diane, to be held by her either
on trust to pay for Emma's schooling (as to about $170,000) or to discharge the
indebtedness of the deceased in respect to the mortgage on the Renwick Street
residence (as to $11,051), or beneficially for herself
(as to the residue of
the estate). 
<P>

34	Christine seeks an order that she should receive from the estate of her
father a sum greater than the $26,000 which she will
receive under the terms of
his will. Diane seeks, in effect, an order that she receive, either
beneficially for herself, or on trust
for Emma's education, the entirety of the
estate of the deceased, and that neither Christine nor Nina should receive any
benefit
from their father's estate. 
<P>

35	The evidence disclosed that the deceased was a generous and loving parent to
each of his three children. He contributed to the
acquisition of a motor
vehicle and to various residences (usually rented) for Christine. Originally
the home unit at Penshurst was
to have been purchased by Christine and her
father conjointly. 
<P>

36	Similarly, although some attempt was made on the part of Christine to
suggest the contrary, the evidence discloses that the deceased
was a loving and
devoted husband to Diane. 
<P>

37	It was submitted on behalf of Christine that she should, in addition to the
amount of about $26,000, which she will receive under
the terms of the will,
receive from the estate an additional amount, sufficient to discharge her
debts, to make a contribution towards
the cost of her wedding, and to pay for a
deposit on a house. 
<P>

38	Although no details were given, it was estimated by Christine that the cost
of her wedding would be between $15,000 and $20,000.
I assume that that cost
will be borne more or less equally between Christine and her partner.
Christine's debts total about $10,600.

<P>

39	It will be appreciated that any order which might be made in favour of
Christine must be made in the light of the competing claims
upon the
beneficence of the deceased. Those competing claims are the claims of the other
two children of the deceased and the claim
of the widow. The deceased
recognised an obligation to make provision for each of those four persons,
being his widow and his three
children. Nina, by deciding to discontinue her
present proceedings, must be taken to be satisfied with the provision made for
her
under the will of the deceased. Christine seeks to obtain more. Any
additional amount which she might receive from the estate must,
of necessity,
come from the interests of Nina, Emma, or Diane. 
<P>

40	Although Nina now does not wish to receive an amount greater than that
provided for her by the will, her present attitude of
not pursuing her claim
for further provision does not mean that she abandons or does not to assert her
entitlement to receive the
benefit given to her by the will. I would be
reluctant, in the circumstances of this case (and in the absence of any
submission by
either of the other plaintiffs that I should do so), to benefit
Christine at the expense of Nina. I certainly would not encroach
upon the
interest directly given to Emma in order to benefit Christine. 
<P>

41	I have already observed that the deceased recognised an obligation to make
provision for his widow and each of his three children.
However, it is apparent
from the terms of clause 2 of the will that the deceased believed that his
assets included life insurance
with National Mutual and an investment with the
AMP Society. It would appear that the deceased did, in fact, have life
insurance,
but not with National Mutual. Accordingly, his life insurance (with
Australian Mutual Provident Society) in an amount of $28,428
forms part of
residue and thus passes to Diane. Similarly, it would appear that the deceased
had held (apparently conjointly with
Diane) a policy with National Mutual, but
that that policy was not one of life insurance. Diane thus is entitled to and
will receive
(although directly, and not as a result of the provisions of the
will) an amount of $27,600 from the National Mutual Retirement Fund
Policy.
<P>

42	In addition, it will be appreciated that the hardship payments totalling
$20,000 received by Diane have the effect of reducing
by that amount the only
substantial asset which comes within the provisions of clause 2 of the will.

<P>

43	Although it is difficult to be absolutely certain concerning the intentions
of the deceased in this regard (since, as I have
already observed, the will
appears to have been prepared by the deceased personally), it is possible that
it was the intention of
the deceased that the assets which should be subject to
clause 2 would include the life policy with AMP, and the retirement policy
with
National Mutual, with the consequence that the assets which he intended to be
subject to the provisions of clause 2 of the will
would have had a total value
exceeding that which they in fact have. If so, the share of each child would in
consequence be greater.
<P>

44	I have in my calculations proceeded upon the basis that the figures
presented by Diane concerning the education of Emma at Wenona
should be
accepted. Evidence was given concerning the thought and care which was given by
the deceased, and by Diane, to the education
of Emma and to their choice of an
appropriate school for her. It has been said that the best investment which
parents can make is
in the education of their children. 
<P>

45	Nevertheless, there is considerable force in the submission on behalf of
Christine that the school education expenses of Emma
are open-ended. Those
expenses could, at least in possibility, exhaust the entirety of the fund
established under clause 2 of the
will, with the consequence that the children
would receive nothing. It may well be that ultimately it becomes necessary for
the executor
to seek judicial advice from the Court (or even to embark upon an
administration suit) in order to establish how much of that fund
should
properly be expended on the schooling of Emma. Otherwise there can be no
certainty as to the amount which should properly
be deducted for that purpose
from the fund. Unless there be such certainty, the amount which will eventually
pass to the children
cannot be ascertained. 
<P>

46	The claim of Christine for a benefit exceeding the $26,000 given to her by
the will of the deceased and the claim of Diane for
the totality of the estate
must be regarded essentially as being claims in competition with each other. If
any order is made in favour
of Christine the practical consequence will be
that, to the extent of such an order, the benefit to be given to Diane will be
reduced.
Similarly, if any order is made in favour of Diane, the practical
consequence will be that the benefit to be given to Christine will
be reduced.
I would be reluctant to benefit Diane at the expense of Nina. I certainly would
not encroach upon the interest directly
given to Emma in order to benefit
Diane.
<P>

47	It should here also be noted that the proceedings of Diane were instituted
some four months after the expiration of the eighteen
months limitation period
provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. Diane seeks an
order for extension of the time in which to institute her proceedings.
<P>

48	In support of such an application for extension of time Diane relied upon
the protracted negotiations conducted by her solicitors
with the trustee of the
superannuation fund, and the subsequent appeal by her from the decision of the
trustee to the Superannuation
Complaints Tribunal, and the presently pending
challenge in the High Court of Australia to the constitutionality of the
establishment
of that Tribunal. She submitted that there has been no prejudice
to Nina or Christine as a result of making her application out of
time.
<P>

49	As I understand it, it was submitted on behalf of Diane that if the trustee
had paid directly to her the amount of superannuation
entitlement of the
deceased, rather than paying it to the estate, it would not have been necessary
for Diane to have instituted her
present proceedings. 
<P>

50	I am satisfied that, if Diane has otherwise established an entitlement to
further provision out of the estate of her husband,
it is appropriate that the
Court should also make an order extending the time for the institution of her
proceedings. If she has
not established an entitlement to such further
provision, then it would futile for the Court to make an order extending
time.
<P>

51	It has been said that the duty of a testator to his widow is, to the extent
that his assets so enable him, to ensure that she
is secure in her residence,
that she is able to live at a standard no less than that which she enjoyed
during the lifetime of her
husband, and that she has a fund to meet
contingencies. 
<P>

52	In the instant case Diane is secure in her residence. The will makes
provision for her to receive the interest of the deceased
as tenant in common
in the Renwick Street residence. In consequence, therefore, Diane will be the
absolute owner of the totality
of that residence. The will also makes provision
for a fund to be available to discharge the outstanding mortgage on that house
property.
In consequence, therefore, the outgoings of Diane will be reduced by
the amount which she has to the present being paying in respect
to that
mortgage. She will also have, under the terms of the will, the residue of the
estate, about $128,000. 
<P>

53	In addition to the house property and the home unit and a Ford Fairmont
motor vehicle (to which Diane ascribed a value of about
$11,000), the residue
of the estate will, upon my calculations, total about $128,000, from which must
be deducted at least Diane's
costs of about $25,000. That is, apart from
becoming the owner of the entirety of the house property and of the home unit,
Diane
will receive a motor vehicle and about $100,000. As a result of her
becoming the owner of the entirety of the home unit, Diane's
income from that
source will increase from $5,359 to $10,718. In addition, under the terms of
the will, there will be a fund sufficient
to guarantee payment for Emma's
schooling. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that Diane has
established an entitlement
to any greater provision from the estate than that
which she receives under the terms of the will. 
<P>

54	I have already referred to the submission on behalf of Christine that, in
addition to the benefit given to her under the will,
she should receive from
the estate an additional amount which would be sufficient to discharge her
debts, to make a contribution
towards the cost of her wedding, and to pay for a
deposit on a house. Christine's debts total about $10,700. They include a loan
in respect to a motor car ($5,800), St. George Visa Card indebtedness ($1,245),
AGC ($2,370), Grace Bros ($750), loan from a family
member ($600). Christine's
de facto partner, Mr Abonyi, has liabilities totalling almost $4,700
(consisting of a personal loan from
Select Credit Union, $4,125, and a Select
Credit Union Visa Card indebtedness, $550). His current assets consist of
personal property
having an estimated value of $200 and a credit balance with
Select Credit Union of $115. 
<P>

55	Christine would require an amount of $10,700 to pay off her own liabilities,
or $15,400 to pay off the totality of the liabilities
of herself and her de
facto partner. If she and her partner contribute equally to their wedding, then
her contribution would be between
$7,500 and $10,000. 
<P>

56	I do not consider that Christine has established an entitlement to have her
father, or his estate, provide for her a deposit
on a house. In any event, no
evidence was placed before the Court concerning any residences which Christine
and her partner might
be desirous of acquiring, or the cost of any such
residences. Nevertheless, the evidence discloses that the deceased during his
lifetime
gave considerable assistance to Christine when she was arranging
accommodation (usually rented) for herself. I have already referred
to the fact
that originally it was intended that the Penshurst home unit was to be
purchased by Christine and her father conjointly,
and that it was only when
Christine did not proceed with that purchase that her father then joined with
Diane in ultimately effecting
the purchase of that home unit. 
<P>

57	Had he lived, it is possible, indeed probable, that the deceased would have
given financial assistance to Christine towards the
acquisition of a residence
upon her marriage. However, the Court must look to the facts and circumstances
as they obtain at the present
time, and, in particular, to the competing claims
of Christine on the one hand and Diane and Emma on the other hand upon the
testamentary
bounty of the deceased. 
<P>

58	Christine and her partner have a conjoint income of $1,238 net a week (that
is, in excess of $64,000 net a year). I recognise
that her partner has an
obligation to pay maintenance and other expenses (totalling about $8,500 a
year) for a child of a former
relationship. Nevertheless, I also note that the
totality of the amounts which Christine and her partner spend on cigarettes and
entertainment is $13,000.
<P>

59	In all the circumstances, however, I have reached the conclusion that it is
appropriate that, in addition to the benefits to
which Christine is entitled
under the will of the deceased (being in amount of about $26,000), she should
also receive an amount
which, taken with that earlier benefit, will enable her
to discharge her present debts and liabilities, to contribute to her wedding,
and to give her a start upon her married life (if not by providing an amount
sufficient for a deposit upon a residence, at least
going some way towards that
purpose). Accordingly, I propose to order that, in addition to the benefits
given to her under the will
of the deceased, Christine should receive an
additional legacy from the estate of the deceased in an amount of $30,000. 
<P>

60	It will be appreciated that that additional legacy will be payable out of
residue, and will thus reduce by that amount the funds
available in residue
(totalling, upon my calculations, about $128,000). Further, from residue there
must also be deducted, not only
the costs of Diane to which I have already
referred, but also the costs of Christine. There will still, however, remain in
residue,
even after the payment of such a legacy and the payment of the costs
of both Christine and Diane, a cash amount of about $50,000,
which (in addition
to the other assets to which I have already referred) will pass to Diane under
the terms of the will. 
<P>

61	The competing claim of Diane as the widow of the deceased will not, in my
view, have the effect of reducing, or even extinguishing,
the proposed legacy
of $30,000 to Christine, an entitlement to which Christine has otherwise
established. My reason for this conclusion
concerning the competing claim of
Diane is that, not only will she receive the foregoing cash amount of residue,
but she has, in
addition, already under the terms of the will received the
entirety of the Renwick Street residence, the entirety of the Nelson Street
home unit (with a concomitant increase of $5,359 in her annual income),
together with a motor car, and also will receive, directly
and not as a result
of the provisions of the will, the amount of $27,600 from the National Mutual
Retirement Fund.
<P>

62	I have heard some submissions as to costs, including the costs of Nina.
However, I will give to the parties an opportunity, should
they so desire, to
make further submissions in respect to costs, in the light of my foregoing
conclusions. 
<P>

63	My present view is that in proceedings 1861 of 1997 each of Christine and
Diane should receive her costs out of the estate, those
of Christine being on
the party and party basis, and those of Diane, the executor, being on the
indemnity basis. Since it was only
at the commencement of the hearing that Nina
abandoned her claim, she certainly would not be entitled to receive any order
for her
costs out of the estate. My present view is that the costs of that
hearing were not appreciably increased by the fact that Nina had
been named as
a plaintiff in the first proceedings. The affidavit evidence which it was
necessary for Diane to put on, both in her
capacity as executor and in support
of her own claim, was not increased by the involvement of Nina. Unless any
party wishes to submit
to the contrary, it seems to me appropriate that I
should make no order in respect to the costs of Nina, to the intent that she
should
bear her own costs of the proceedings, but that she should not be
required to pay the costs of any other party.
<P>

64	Similarly, it seems to me that neither the evidence nor the hearing time was
significantly increased by the institution by Diane
of proceedings 4000 of
1998. In the light of my conclusion in those proceedings, I consider it
appropriate that there be no costs
order in those proceedings, to the intent
that each party thereto will bear her own costs of those proceedings.
<P>

65	Accordingly, unless within seven days of the date hereof, any party makes
application to my Associate to have the matter listed
for argument as to costs,
I make the following orders:
<P>

66	1861 of 1997 Christine Anne Croucher v Diane Joan Croucher
<P>

	1. 	I order that, in addition to the benefits given to her 	by the will of the
late Christopher John Croucher 	("the deceased"),
the plaintiff Christine Anne
Croucher receive a legacy in the sum of $30,000, 	such legacy not to bear
interest if paid on or before
	13 June 1999.
<P>

	2.	I order that the claim of the plaintiff Nina Tracey 	Beilby be
dismissed.
<P>

	3. 	I order that the costs of the plaintiff Christine Anne 	Croucher on the
party and party basis and the costs 	of the defendant
on the 	indemnity basis
be paid out 	of the estate of the deceased, and otherwise I make 	no order as
to costs.
<P>

67	4000 of 1998 Diane Joan Croucher v Christine Anne Croucher
<P>

	1. 	I order that the proceedings be dismissed.
<P>

	2.	I make no order as to costs, to the intent that each 	party will bear her
own costs.
<P>

In each matter the exhibits may be returned.
<P>
