<P>


<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 30 November 1984, the applicant, who
was then aged 29 years, was convicted of the murder of one John Wallace
Mitchell on or about
18 June 1983 and of assaulting Bruce Kitamura and
attempting to rob him of cocaine whilst armed with a .375 magnum revolver.
These
offences arose out of the same occasion.  He was sentenced to penal
servitude for life on each count to be served concurrently and
dating from the
time of his arrest, namely 29 June 1983.  On 27 April 1987, whilst serving
those life sentences he was convicted
of the murder of Anthony William Cameron
at Malabar on 27 November 1983 and on, 28 May 1987, he was sentenced to penal
servitude
for life in respect of this crime.  The second murder was committed
whilst the applicant was at Long Bay prison awaiting trial for
the crimes of
which he was convicted in November 1984.  The offences of June 1983 were
committed when he had been at liberty for
about seven months following his
release on licence after serving something less than eleven months of a
four-year term of imprisonment
for armed robbery imposed on 26 January 1982.

<P>

2   	Having served in respect of the first two sentences of life
imprisonment a little over twelve years and in respect of the second
murder a
little less than nine and a half years the applicant's application for
re-determination of those sentences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</i>
1989</a> (the Act) was dealt with by Allen J on 18 August 1995.  His Honour
considered that the applications should be dismissed and specified
that two
years must elapse before an application might again be made to this Court for
re-determination.  In doing so, his Honour
said -
<P>

"The objective gravity, however, of the offences for which the life sentences
were imposed was so great that I do not consider that
[I should] ... now
proceed to re-determine the life sentences.  In that regard I am most affected
by the second murder which was
a cold, calculated, deceitful assassination.  It
is an offence so grave that were he to be sentenced now for that offence, under
present sentencing patterns, he might well be looking at a sentence of penal
servitude for life, the sentence meaning precisely that."
<P>

The applicant now seeks once again to have the life sentences re-determined
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> of the Act.  
<P>

3   	It is necessary briefly to set out the facts underlying the
three convictions.  At approximately midnight on 17 June 1983,
the applicant,
who was armed with a loaded .357 calibre revolver and accompanied by another
man, both disguised with balaclavas,
arrived at Kitamura's house at Whale Beach
planning to rob him of drugs, of which he was a supplier.  Present at the house
as a guest
was the deceased Mitchell who struggled with the applicant and was
fatally wounded when the loaded revolver was discharged during
the struggle.
The applicant told the police that he realised that a man was dead, but said "I
only went there to rob them not hurt
them, that's the truth".  The report of
the Probation and Parole officer tendered for the purpose of the sentence
proceedings before
the trial judge stated that he displayed "little remorse"
over Mr Mitchell's death.  That this is so is plainly demonstrated by the
commission of the murder of Cameron almost exactly five months after Mitchell's
killing.  Cameron was killed by either inhaling or
having had injected pure
heroin.  This murder was committed by the applicant on a promise of payment of
a large quantity of heroin
by another prisoner, then facing serious drug
charges, who thought that Cameron, jointly charged with him, might give
evidence against
him.  It was a contract killing.  To my mind, the
characterisation by Allen J of this crime, which I have set out above, is
entirely
justified.  It is a matter of concern that the applicant continues to
deny that he was involved in the death of Cameron in any way
at all, a denial
which he also maintained before Allen J.  Quite apart from the uncertainties
which this introduces so far as rehabilitation
is concerned, the element of
remorse and contrition which, if genuine, is relevant to be taken into account
on sentence in a prisoner's
favour is not available to the applicant.
<P>

4   	The Serious Offenders Review Council, the report of which
the Court was required to take into account for the purposes of his
former
application, said -
<P>

"The Council has found MAIN (the applicant) to be drug affected from time to
time and generally to be an unsatisfactory prisoner.
 He has been tested at B
classification institutions and has failed on each occasion.
<P>

Occurrences since October 1993 reinforces the Council's opinion of 5 October
1993 that he is not yet rehabilitated.
<P>

His murders were drug-related, he committed one murder whilst on remand and has
been troubled throughout his imprisonment by indulgence
in illicit drugs.
<P>

The Review Council will persevere with further efforts to assist him overcome
his drug problems but holds no hope at present.  It
would not be safe in the
foreseeable future for MAIN to return to the community."
<P>

Allen J and, with respect I agree with him, was not persuaded that all the
incidents adverted to in the documentation which accompanied
the Council's
report showing the partaking of illicit drugs by the applicant whilst in
custody did occur.  But there was good reason
for thinking that the applicant
had not then overcome his dependence on drugs. That he still requires 100 to
110 milligrams of methadone
a day and expects to do so for the foreseeable
future demonstrates that there has been little change in this respect.  Having
regard
to the circumstances surrounding the crimes for which he is seeking
sentence re-determination, this matter is a troubling one.  
<P>

5   	The report of the Serious Offenders Review Council of 20
April 1998, prepared for the purposes of the present application disclosed
that, since about 1997 there had been significant improvement in the
applicant's attitude and behaviour;  in particular he is now
regarded as being
an excellent worker and has taken on significant responsibilities by running
Narcotics Anonymous for the benefit
of other prisoners.  Even so, the Council's
report falls short of assessing him as suitable for eventual release into the
community,
although this course is not opposed as it had been when he first
applied for re-determination.  The Council's conclusion is as follows
-
<P>

"In the event that the Supreme Court grants MAIN'S application for the
redetermination of his indeterminate sentence, then the Serious
Offenders
Review Council will develop a plan for his management during the remainder of
any minimum term imposed.  Hopefully, MAIN
will be progressively reduced in
security classification leading ultimately to his inclusion in unsupervised Day
Leave and Work Release
programs in preparation for his eventual return into the
community."
<P>

6   	I think it fair to say that, in the present context, the
applicant has shown some real progress towards rehabilitation in the
last two
years but he must go much further before he can be released.  His son gave
evidence that the applicant has become easier
to communicate with and is "just
a calmer person basically".  He was able to offer the applicant work and
provide accommodation.
 
<P>

7   	Rehabilitation, of course, is not the only function of
sentencing.  There must be appropriate punishment for the crimes which
have
been committed.  Murder, it hardly needs saying, is an extremely serious crime
but the murders committed by this applicant fell
into the more serious and
culpable class.  In the first, he sought out a victim in his own home with an
armed weapon the discharge
of which at any human being would obviously be very
likely to cause serious injury and possibly death.  The applicant showed very
little, if any, remorse.  The second victim also did not, as it were, come
across his path and because of something that occurred
between them, meet his
death.  Rather, the applicant sought him out to murder him for reward.  
<P>

8   	I frankly do not know by what measure it is possible to
assess with any reasonable degree of confidence the extent to which
any person
who committed crimes such as these might demonstrate such a change of character
to enable a reliable prediction that there
was such a change as to allow his
safe release into the community.  There are signs, however, that point, in my
estimation, towards
the possibility of this being so in due course so far as
this applicant is concerned.  In his report of 23 March 1995, Mr A Andreasen,
a
consulting clinical psychologist who examined the applicant at the Grafton
Correctional Centre for psychological testing and assessment,
concluded as
follows -
<P>

"The overall evaluation of this man in terms of both the interview and the
testing is that he remains a very self confident highly
active manipulative
person who operates as much as possible in terms of being a law unto himself.
He clearly continues to have the
considerable distortion of personality that
was the basis of his criminality and drug addiction before his incarceration on
these
offences.  I note that there is a history of negative attitudes toward
this man on the part of the jail authorities although these
have not always
resulted in charges or in proven evidence.  While such behaviour in prison
could of course be his means of surviving
in custody, it is nevertheless likely
to predict continuation of the self centered, impulsive, hyperactive approach
that was associated
with him getting into trouble in the past and with his use
of heroin."
<P>

I should point out that I do not see any element of impulsiveness at all in the
applicant's commission of the crimes I am presently
considering.  Indeed, it is
their very deliberate character (except for the killing of Mr Mitchell) which
to a considerable degree
renders them so grave.
<P>

9   	The applicant was again assessed by Dr Lucas in July 1998.
Despite the improvements to which I have referred, Dr Lucas commented
that -
<P>

"Overall, his presentation was consistent with the assessment carried out by Mr
Allan Andreasen in 1995.  My assessment of him is
not markedly different from
Mr Andreasen's."
<P>

Dr Lucas's diagnosis was as follows -
<P>

"The most likely personality diagnosis is of antisocial personality disorder.
It is likely he had a conduct disorder prior to the
age of fifteen.  His
principal personality characteristics have been well described by Mr Andreasen.
What one looks for in a man
his age who suffered a personality disorder of the
antisocial type is evident of maturation with amelioration of antisocial and
impulsive
traits.  One hopes that such changes will become evidence in the
fourth decade of life - they do in a significant number of cases
- and there
may be some indications that Mr Main, rather late in life, is showing signs of
improvement in his prison conduct.  However
it seems probable that there are a
number of personality traits including a high level of activity, impulsively
and possibly excess
confidence, which in some circumstances in the community
might get him into difficulties.  As to how much these traits will change
over
time is difficult to predict."
<P>

10   	Not surprisingly, Dr Lucas opines that the applicant's
"personal history and criminal record, combined with his personality,
make the
difficulties in deciding how [he] ... would function outside prison."  The most
important consideration, from Dr Lucas's
point of view, was whether there was
reasonable evidence of an improvement in prison behaviour in recent years and
the need for the
applicant to demonstrate that any such improvement has a
strong foundation.  
<P>

11   	The applicant did not give evidence before me, so I have
had no opportunity to assess him for myself.  However, after carefully
considering the whole of the material before me, I am persuaded that there is
some indication of genuine change.  It is more, but
not much more, than slight
and sufficient, I think, to enable the Court to infer that there is a
reasonable possibility (and I can
put it no higher) that it will continue and
improve.  However, having regard to the applicant's history, I have no doubt
that a great
deal more time must elapse before he will reach the stage when
indeed he will be reasonably fit for release.
<P>

12   	As I understand it, the philosophy underlying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> of the
Act is that it would be unfair and certainly contrary to our accepted notions
of justice if the passing of the "truth in sentencing"
legislation had the
effect of retrospectively imposing more serious sentences than those which had
already been lawfully passed.
 The sentences currently being served by the
applicant were imposed according to the law as it then stood.  That law, as
O'Brien
CJ at CL observed on the occasion of first sentencing the applicant to
life imprisonment was that a life sentence did not mean what
it said.  His
Honour made this observation in response to the jury's recommendation for
leniency which they added as a rider to the
guilty verdict on the murder count.
This, very likely, followed because the Crown case was not that the applicant
intended to kill
or cause grievous bodily harm or that he acted with reckless
indifference to human life but rather he was guilty of murder because
the
unintended death occurred in the course of a felony.  In my opinion, the
evidence would not have supported a conclusion beyond
reasonable doubt that the
applicant had shot the victim with any relevant murderous intent.  The
situation is altogether different,
of course, so far as the second killing is
concerned.
<P>

13   	The relevant principles to be applied by a court hearing
an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> </i>have been usefully
summarised in the judgment of James J in <i>Regina v Christopher
Hatziathanasiou</i> (unreported NSWSC 25 October 1995) as follows -
<P>

"(i)	The fresh sentencing exercise required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> is in essence no different
to that which would have been undertaken at the time of the original
proceedings on sentence, had the
penalty to be imposed then been wholly at the
discretion of the sentencing judge, save that the judge on the application
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> has the advantage of a great deal of hindsight.
<P>

(ii)	The refusal of an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> is
tantamount to confirming the sentence of penal servitude for life originally
imposed.  Hence, an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> should not (at least normally) be
refused, unless the appropriate sentence, by virtue of the application of
ordinary sentencing principles
to all of the material available to the court,
is one for the remainder of the life of the prisoner.  Such a sentence will be
the
appropriate sentence only if the applicant's case falls within the worst
category of cases of murder.
<P>

(iii)	If a judge decides to set a minimum term, then in setting a minimum term
the judge fixes the minimum period which the prisoner
must serve in prison.  On
the expiration of the minimum term set by the judge the offender will be
eligible for release on parole
but he will not be entitled to be released on
parole unless a parole order is made by the Offenders Review Board, and the
Board is
not to make a parole order unless the Board has inter alia determined
that the release of the offender is appropriate, having regard
to the principle
that the public interest is of primary importance.
<P>

(iv)	By virtue of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A(5)</a> it is not possible to impose
cumulative sentences on an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A.</a>  Consequently, where, as in
the present case, more than one sentence was imposed by the original sentencing
judge, then, if the application
is granted, the longest of the sentences
imposed by the judge hearing the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13A</a> application must reflect the totality of
the criminality in all of the offences committed by the offender, including the
offences
for which determinate sentences were originally imposed."
<P>

I respectfully adopt and apply what was there said by his Honour.  
<P>

14   	Applying those principles to the present case, I think it
reasonably clear that although it was very serious, the killing
of Mitchell did
not fall within the worst category of cases of murder.  On the other hand, the
killing of Cameron is much more serious
again.  The applicant was a mature man
of 28 years.  He was in prison awaiting trial for the killing of another person
only months
before.  It was a cold-blooded, pre-planned murder for reward.
Whether or not his victim was a drug addict or involved in drug dealing
is, to
my mind, irrelevant.  The law will not weigh in the scales the value of a life.
The applicant has shown no remorse.  It is
possible to discern, as I have said,
the commencement of genuine rehabilitation but whether this means that the
applicant is less
likely to kill again, it is impossible to know and I have
significant doubts that this is so.  If the sentencing judge had a discretion
such as is now the case, the imposition of a life sentence upon the applicant,
that is, life meaning life, would have been a proper
exercise of his Honour's
sentencing discretion.  
<P>

15   	It was submitted, however, that it would be appropriate to
impose a minimum term on the applicant with an additional term
of life
imprisonment:  see, eg <i>Regina v Terry Mark Hitchins </i>(unreported, NSWSC 3
June 1993).  This would have the effect of permitting the Offenders Review
Board to determine whether, following
expiration of the minimum term, the
applicant is fit to be released into the community for the balance of his
sentence and, if so
released, to be supervised appropriately.  The mere fact
that the applicant is not presently ready for release and no prediction
can be
made when, if ever, he will be is not a sufficient reason for refusing to set a
minimum term:  <i>Regina v Anthony Lanigan</i> (unreported, NSWCCA 31 August
1992), <i>Regina v Hitchins</i> (supra).  While the possibility of
rehabilitation will be taken into account in a prisoner's favour, to a greater
or lesser extent
depending on the gravity of the offence (see eg <i>Regina v
Purdey</i> (unreported, NSWSC 5 November 1992),<i> Bugmy v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
169 CLR 525</a> at, 530, 532), the lack of rehabilitative prospects must not
increase a sentence that is otherwise proportionate to the crime.  Nor
are
retribution and deterrence the only relevant factors in sentencing, even for
murder, although for two murders they must comprise
by far the most importance
considerations. 
<P>

16   	Several Victims' Impact Statements have been tendered in
respect of the killing of Anthony Cameron.  The law provides for
this to be
done:  s23C of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure</i> <i>Act </i>1986</a>.  In these
statements, Anthony's mother and his widow express their intense feelings of
grief at Anthony's killing and their justified
anger towards his murderer.  Nor
have their sufferings come to an end, as each succeeding day reminds them of
their loss.  In permitting
these statements to be received, however, the law
does not thereby place them to be weighed in the scales of judgment.  I
respectfully
agree with and adopt the careful reasoning of Hunt CJ at CL in
<i>R v Previtera</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20ACrimR%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 ACrimR 76</a> at 85 ff as to why this must be so.
The heinousness of murder is so great in the eyes of the law that it matters
not whether the
victim's death is the cause of pain or grief to many or to
none.  Few notions could be more obnoxious to the moral standards essential
to
the rule of law than the suggestion that justice could regard the life of one
person as more or less valuable than the life of
another or, to put it in
another way, the killing of one person as more grievous than the killing of
another because of their personal
and social circumstances.  All right thinking
people would accept that it would be completely wrong to take one day from an
otherwise
appropriate sentence for murder because the deceased was obnoxious,
stupid, friendless and alone.  By exact parity of reasoning,
it cannot be right
to add a day to an otherwise appropriate sentence because the deceased was
loving, intelligent and surrounded
by friends and family.  If this were not so,
counsel for a murderer might rationally submit that, as the deceased was of the
former
character, the sentence should be more lenient and the Crown Prosecutor,
by pointing to a grieving widow, submit the contrary.  The
virtues or vices of
the deceased, the extent of his or her social connections and whether the death
caused grief or relief or was
simply unnoticed by the indifference of the
uninvolved, would then become the subject of evidence and argument.  The law
will neither
value a life nor punish a death by such a demeaning process.  In
this case, for example, no Victims' Impact Statement has been filed
in respect
of Mr Mitchell.  Yet it would be completely wrong of me to deal with his death
on the basis that, somehow, it is less
serious than that of Anthony Cameron.
The reason that sentences in respect of those two murders might differ arises
from the circumstances
in which they occurred.  Of course, I acknowledge and
sympathise with the grief and loss which Anthony Cameron's family have suffered
but, for the reasons I have stated, it would be wrong of me to allow those
feelings to increase the sentence that, in point of law,
is otherwise
appropriate.
<P>

(b)	not reapply to the Court under this section for a specified period."

18   	A direction under s13A(8)(a) (that a prisoner may never
reapply to a court for redetermination) may be given only where the
applicant
was sentenced for the crime of murder and "it is a most serious case of murder
and it is in the public interest that the
determination not be made":  section
13A(8)(c).  Were I to sentence this applicant today, having regard to the
extreme seriousness
of the crimes of murder that he has committed, more
especially that of Cameron, I would have made an order under s13A(8)(a) with
the effect that he would be required to serve the life sentence relating to the
murder of Anthony Cameron for the term of his natural
life.  I am mindful,
however, that under s13A(9), the Supreme Court in exercising its functions
under this provision, is required,
amongst other things, to consider whether
there has been any material change in the applicant's character, especially
concerning
his or her possible rehabilitation.  It is this requirement which
gives a significantly different sentencing context to a proceeding
under this
provision than that which applies when sentencing a prisoner for the first
time.  It is, I consider, a reflection of the
circumstance that when a life
sentence was imposed under the old law a prisoner was eligible to be released
on licence under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</i> 1900</a> as it then stood and that age and
good behaviour, alone, might eventually provide a sufficient basis for release
despite the heinousness
of the crime.  A marked degree of rehabilitation in
such a prisoner could permit a minimum term to be determined (although it would
necessarily be lengthy) in due course, even though the crime might, if sentence
were now to be passed for the first time, attract
a life-means-life sentence.
It is this possibility that leads me to conclude that I should not at this time
give a direction under
s13A(8)(a) that the applicant may never reapply to the
court for a re-determination of his life sentences.  However, I have concluded,
in all the circumstances, that I should decline the application to determine a
minimum term and an additional term in order to permit
the applicant to
demonstrate a greater degree of rehabilitation and hence establish possibly
that it is appropriate that he should
obtain in due course a minimum term.
Therefore, I dismiss this application and direct that the applicant not
re-apply to the Court
under s13A of the Act for a period of two years from 9
July 1999.
