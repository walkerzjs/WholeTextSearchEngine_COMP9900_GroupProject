<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	This is an appeal  This matter was referred to me in the
Duty List on 25 November 1999.  It had no urgency and by reason of
its lack of
priority had an interrupted hearing as the Duty List became very busy.  Having
heard Mr Coles QC's submissions who appeared
for the appellant, assisted by his
written outline, and having only partly heard Mr Dowdy for the respondent I
requested him to provide
written submissions by 26 November 1999 to avoid the
incursion of further costs. from the judgment of Acting Master Berecry (the
Master) of 30 September 1999 in which he made an order that the
plaintiff/appellant pay the defendant/respondent's costs of proceedings
the
plaintiff/appellant had commenced to set aside or alternatively vary a
Statutory Demand served on the plaintiff on 21 May 1999.
<P>

<b>Background facts</b>
<P>

2   	The appellant is a wholesaler and retailer of white goods
and since the early 1960's had purchased substantial quantities of
white goods
from the respondent which was a manufacturer of white goods. 
<P>

3   	In early April 1999 Mr Murphy, the general manager of the
plaintiff, was contacted by an employee of the Receiver of the respondent
and
was requested to supply a reconciliation of the account between the appellant
and the respondent.  At that time the general manager
informed the employee of
the Receiver that he was unable to provide a reconciliation because of the
large number of unreconciled
claims, proof of delivery forms and copy invoices.
However, he undertook to have the accounts department run a "payments due
report"
that would show him the invoices remaining unpaid.  
<P>

4   	On being requested to give an "indication" of what amount
was owed by the appellant to the respondent, Mr Murphy said he believed
the
figure was "about $153,000 after claims and rebates".  He was informed that the
accounts indicated a "seriously larger sum of
money owing" and after some
further discussion about warranty provisions undertook to forward material to
the Receiver's office.

<P>

5   	Mr Murphy heard nothing further in respect of the
resolution of "any account issues" until a Statutory Demand was served on
the
appellant on 21 May 1999 for an alleged debt of $4,330,382.59.  An affidavit of
21 May 1999 of Mr Anthony Crawford, an accountant
with the Receiver's firm,
Messrs Ferrier Hodgson, was also served on the appellant.  That affidavit
contained a paragraph in which
Mr Crawford stated that he had a belief that
"there is no genuine dispute about the existence or amount" of the alleged
debt.
<P>

6   	On 24 May 1999 the appellant's solicitors, Messrs Deacons
Graham and James wrote to the respondent's solicitors, Messrs Henry
Davis York.
Apart from claiming in colourful terms that such an amount was not owed by the
appellant to the respondent the solicitors
went on to say:
<P>

"We put it to you that it is a serious issue to serve a Statutory Demand based
on a specious set of figures.  You are well aware
that Statutory Demands are
not to be used as mere tools of debt collection.  Our client is solvent and
well able to pay.  It declines
to pay it at this stage.  If the Statutory
Demand is not withdrawn and our client is forced to apply to the Court for an
order setting
the Demand aside you may be assured our client will be seeking
costs on a full indemnity basis."
<P>

7   	The appellant's solicitors informed the respondent's
solicitors that the appellant conceded that it owed the respondent "some
moneys" but requested particulars of the basis of the calculation of the
alleged debt.
<P>

8   	After further correspondence and by 2 June 1999 the
appellant's solicitors repeated a request for a breakdown of the amount
claimed
to be owing by the appellant and then informed the solicitors for the
respondent:
<P>

We repeat our request for a meeting between your firm, this firm, the receiver
and our client.  Our client is not attempting to
avoid any issues - it wishes
to confront them, deal with them and get rid of this matter.
<P>

9   	This meeting did not take place prior to the expiry of the
twenty-one day period in the Statutory Demand.  It appears that
one of the
reasons for this was that Mr Crawford was away at a "long planned seminar" at
the Gold Coast.  More importantly to the
respondent was its claim that the
appellant had not supplied documentary material to the respondent which it
wanted so that it could
"check it and properly respond".
<P>

10   	On 11 June 1999 the appellant issued a summons to set
aside the Statutory Demand or alternatively to vary it to $324,624.24.
<P>

11   	Between the time of the issuing of the Summons and 6
August 1999 there was further correspondence between the appellant and
the
respondent and in a letter of 22 July 1999 the appellant's solicitors referred
the respondent's solicitors to s 459H(1) of the
Corporations Law and
claimed:
<P>

The Statutory Demand details three separate amounts claimed by St George from
Winnings.  In our opinion, there is a genuine dispute
as to the existence or
the amount of each of these claimed debts, and we are confident that the court
would also reach that conclusion.
 Of course, that may not be the end of the
matter.
<P>

Assuming that St George does not wish this matter to become mired in lengthy
litigation, our client proposes that all parties meet,
together with such
experts or advisers as may be required, in order to arrive at a resolution of
the matter once and for all.
<P>

12   	On 29 July 1999 the respondent's solicitors responded to
the appellant's solicitors advising that they would "shortly be in
a position
to serve upon you our client's evidence in chief in these proceedings".  The
respondent's solicitors advised that the
meeting would not take place until the
appellant wrote to the respondent advising with some specificity why the
appellant claimed
that the calculations "of the current debt are wrong".  
<P>

13   	In response to this letter the appellant's solicitors
wrote again on 6 August  and noted that "the Summons issued in these
proceedings and served upon you on 11 June 1999 asked for an order that the
demand be varied to an amount of $324,624.24".  The appellant's
solicitors
further stated "you may take it from us that this is the amount that our client
concedes is owing".
<P>

14   	The appellant's solicitors enclosed the appellant's cheque
in the amount of $324,624.24 "as a gesture of goodwill" and on
the basis of
what had been previously conceded.  The letter continued:
<P>

"Our client contends that issuing a Statutory Demand in a situation where the
amount of the debt was not known, and where there
was a genuine dispute as to
the amount and existence of the debt, constitutes an abuse of process.  We note
that the Statutory Demand
procedure is not to be used as a debt-collecting
agency:  <i>Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Elbakht  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR
697.</a></i>
<P>

15   	Although the cheque was accepted by the respondent it was
done so on a without prejudice basis as to the "amount truly owing".

<P>

16   	On 18 August 1999 the respondent's solicitors suggested
that the proceedings should be resolved on the basis that its client
withdrew
the Statutory Demand and that proceedings be dismissed with an order that the
appellant pay the respondent's costs up to
and including 6 August 1999.
<P>

17   	The appellant's solicitors responded by letter of 19
August 1999 indicating that the disinclination of the appellant to pay
the
amount earlier than 6 August was the "direct result of receiving your client's
Statutory Demand in which untenable claims were
made".  It went on to say:
<P>

Our client always intended to pay your client all amounts that were owing in
the ordinary course, but was forced to seek legal advice
when served with a
demand for outlandish sums of money.
<P>

It seems incredible that, after launching an unsubstantiated and insupportable
claim under the guise of a statutory demand, your
client should seek an
indemnity from our client for its costs simply to withdraw the ill-conceived
demand.  
<P>

The appellant's solicitors suggested that it would be far more equitable that
the appellant's costs be paid particularly because
it had been forced to
perform the respondent's work in quantifying the debt.  However a counter offer
of settlement was then made.
<P>

18   	The proposal put forward by the appellant's solicitors was
that the respondent withdraw the Statutory Demand;  the appellant
discontinue
the proceedings to set aside the demand with the respondent's consent;  the
parties execute a deed whereby they release
all claims that they may have
against each other;  and the appellant pay the respondent's costs in the matter
"presumably less than
but say $5000" such payment to be made at the time of the
exchange of the deed and before the discontinuance.  
<P>

19   	On 25 August 1999 the respondent put a counter offer that
it would accept $10,000 in payment of its costs, however it was
not prepared to
execute a deed of release but it was prepared to agree to the other terms.  
<P>

20   	Apparently nothing further happened until 29 September
1999 when the respondent withdrew the Statutory Demand.
<P>

<b>Court Directions</b>
<P>

21   	On 13 July 1999 the parties filed short minutes of order
in which the respondent agreed to file and serve all its affidavits
and
material upon which it would rely by 27 July 1999.  That did not happen.  
<P>

22   	On 10 August 1999 the parties once again filed short
minutes of order in which the respondent agreed to file and serve all
its
affidavits and material upon which it intended to rely by 31 August.  That did
not happen.  
<P>

23   	On 21 September 1999 the parties once again agreed to
short minutes of order in which the respondent agreed to file in Court
and
serve its affidavits on which it relied by 28 September 1999. Notwithstanding
the fact that the appellant had served all its
evidence upon the respondent and
notwithstanding its agreement to file evidence it did not do so at any
stage.
<P>

24   	On 30 September 1999 as the Statutory Demand the subject
of the relief sought had been withdrawn, the Summons was dismissed
and the only
matter before the Master was the issue of costs.
<P>

<b>Master's judgment 30 September 1999</b>
<P>

25   	The Master referred to the Statutory Demand and the
supporting affidavit of Mr Crawford and said:
<P>

Mr Crawford has not been challenged on his evidence.  On that basis it seems to
me that in the defendant's view the genuine amount
due and owing by the
plaintiff to the defendant was in fact the same set out in the Statutory
Demand.
<P>

26   	After referring to the fact that there was correspondence
between the parties' solicitors the Master referred to the payment
of the
amount on 6 August 1999 and said :
<P>

But for the payment of the money, of course the Statutory Demand would still be
alive to the extent of the variation of the off-setting
provisions of the
Corporations Law.  Therefore to the extent of the variation the defendant was
justified in issuing his Statutory
Demand.  There has been no challenge today
to Mr Crawford's evidence contained in his affidavit.  To that extent the
defendant has
succeeded in the application.
<P>

27   	After referring to the decision of <b>Polaroid Australia
Pty Ltd v Minicomp Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 16 ACLC 529</a> and distinguishing the matter
before him as one different from what Santow J was referring to as a "mini
trial" the Master said:
<P>

In any event, in my view, because the defendant has been successful, it should
be entitled to an order for costs.
<P>

28   	The Master then made an order that the plaintiff/appellant
pay the defendant/respondent's costs on an ordinary basis.
<P>

<b>Grounds of Appeal</b>
<P>

29   	The appellant appeals on the following grounds:
<P>

1.	The Master erred in not finding that the appellant was successful in		the
proceedings;
<P>

2	The Master erred in not finding that the respondent issued the Statutory
Demand knowing that the appellant disputed the amount
of the demand 	and
without any attempt to identify the amount properly owing;
<P>

3.	The Master erred in law in the exercise of his discretion in that heplaced
excessive reliance on one relevant factor, namely
the receiver/manager's
beliefs as at the date of issuing the Statutory Demand; and
<P>

4.	The Master erred in law in the exercise of his discretion in that he		failed
to take into account a relevant factor, namely,
that the policy 		consideration
that the Courts of Equity should not be used for collecting 	debts.
<P>

<b>Consideration of grounds of appeal</b>
<P>

30   	In his judgment the Master stated that the parties had
reached agreement that the Summons should be dismissed.  Mr Coles QC
submitted
that the Summons was dismissed because the respondent had unilaterally
withdrawn its Statutory Demand on 29 September 1999.
 It seems to me that
although there was no opposition in respect of the dismissal of the Summons the
factor that precipitated it
was the unilateral withdrawing of the Statutory
Demand.
<P>

31   	As referred to earlier in this judgment the Master stated
that but for the payment of the money the Statutory Demand would
still be alive
and "to the extent of the variation" the respondent was justified in serving it
on the appellant.
<P>

32   	Mr Coles QC submitted that the withdrawal by the
respondent of the Statutory Demand rendered the Statutory Demand ineffective
rather than the payment of money by the appellant.  This submission has force
and I accept it as an accurate statement of the position.
 
<P>

33   	Mr Coles QC submitted that the Master's statement seems to
indicate that the respondent was justified in issuing the Statutory
Demand
because it resulted in the payment of $324,624.24.  Alternatively Mr Coles QC
submitted that the Master's statement could
be interpreted to mean that on a
hearing of the application to set aside or vary the Statutory Demand, the
Statutory Demand would
have been varied by the offsetting provisions of the
Corporations Law to an amount of $324,624.24 and therefore the respondent was
successful in the proceedings.  
<P>

34   	If that be the correct interpretation that the Master was
intending to convey in his judgment, which I accept it was, Mr Coles
QC
submitted that such a finding would not be consistent with the proper
interpretation of the Statutory Demand procedure.  He submitted
that it would
render a creditor successful, regardless of the amount claimed in the Statutory
Demand, if the creditor was paid some
money by the debtor;  even, if as was the
case in these proceedings, the summons sought as alternative relief the
reduction of the
amount claimed in the Statutory Demand.  
<P>

35   	In those circumstances Mr Coles QC submitted that this
would subvert the central purpose behind the Statutory Demand procedure,
which
is that it is part of the winding up procedure of insolvent companies.
<P>

36   	Mr Coles QC relied upon <b>Intergraph Public Safety Pty
Ltd</b> <b>v Tess Lawrence Media Services Pty Ltd</b> (1996) 19 ACSR 523 an
authority to which the Master was referred but did not mention in his judgment.
In that case Heerey J found
that an order for costs on a solicitor/client basis
was justified and said at 526 - 527:
<P>

...I note that there is no evidence whatsoever suggesting insolvency of the
applicant or any other ground for winding up...  
<P>

...Winding up proceedings are to be used for the winding up of companies, that
is, paying off creditors and distributing whatever
surplus remains amongst the
shareholders...Rather, I infer that it was issused for the improper purpose of
exerting pressure on the
applicant for the payment of what clearly was, as was
known to be, a disputed debt.  So the application is allowed.  The statutory
demand will be set aside.
<P>

The respondents were given fair warning and could have withdrawn the statutory
demand at one time without incurring any costs whatsoever.
 Nevertheless, the
respondent did not withdraw and, of necessity, that provoked the present
application which has been successful.
 So there will be costs on a
solicitor/client basis.
<P>

37   	In the light of the fact that the respondent at no time
alleged that the appellant was an insolvent company Mr Coles QC submitted
that
it could not be said that the respondent intended the issue of the Statutory
Demand to be part of winding up proceedings against
the appellant.
<P>

38   	Mr Coles QC submitted that I would be satisfied that this
was a suitable case for the award of costs in the appellant's favour
on a
solicitor/client basis.  In support of this submission he relied upon
<b>Polaroid Australia v Minicomp Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 16 ACLC 529</a> in which Santow
J said at 536:
<P>

Sooner or later, courts will have to consider whether indemnity costs should be
awarded against the unsuccessful user of a statutory
notice to force payment of
a genuinely contested debt, simply because those taking out such statutory
demands are disregarding that
basic principle.  Mini trials of such disputes
simply add to costs, more especially as the relevant tests do not ordinarily
permit
more than a relatively superficial probing"
<P>

39   	An additional matter which Mr Coles QC submitted caused
the Master to fall into error in exercising his discretion in favour
of the
respondent was his focus upon the fact that Anthony Crawford was not the
subject of any cross examination. 
<P>

40   	There was some material tendered, objected to but not
ruled upon, before the Master which included a Report as to Affairs
in which
the total amount listed as owing by the appellant was no more than $767,000.
This material was relied upon by the appellant
before me and was admitted over
the objection of the respondent.
<P>

41   	This material throws into stark contrast the amount of $4
million odd about which Mr Crawford claimed a belief that there
was no genuine
dispute.  Although he was not cross examined this report was evidence upon
which the Court would have been entitled
to form a view that there was
certainly a question about the accuracy of the $4 million amount.
<P>

42   	Mr Coles QC submitted that regardless of the Receiver's
belief at the date of the swearing of the affidavit it must have been
the case
that by 26 May 1999 when the respondent received the appellant's solicitor's 24
May letter it knew the debt was disputed.
 Indeed much of the evidence before
the Master consisted of letters from the appellant's solicitor's contesting the
alleged amount
of the debt.
<P>

43   	Mr Dowdy submitted that the appellant has not demonstrated
that the Master adopted a wrong principle or allowed extraneous
matters to
guide or affect him <b>Gronow v Gronow </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20144%20CLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 144 CLR 513</a> at 534.
<P>

44   	He submitted that the appellant "unreasonably persisted in
seeking to have its costs paid on an indemnity basis" after the
respondent had
made an "eminently reasonable and sensible offer" A reference to the offer to
withdraw the Statutory Demand and have
its costs paid up to 6 August 1999
contained in its solicitor's letter of 18 August 1999. which it was submitted
"ought to have been
accepted".
<P>

45   	Mr Dowdy submitted that the appellant "simply played
games" with the respondent and emphasised that although it conceded that
it
owed money to the respondent it did not pay any amount until 6 August 1999.  He
submitted that unless the respondent had "persisted
in this litigation to the
extent which it did it would never have been paid the amount of $324,624.24 and
that certainly would not
have been a just result".
<P>

46   	But the appellant sought two orders (1) to set the
Statutory Demand aside or (2) to vary it.  On either approach it was successful
in the litigation as the Statutory Demand was withdrawn.  
<P>

47   	I am of the view that the Master fell into error in
holding that the respondent had been "successful" because the appellant
had
conceded and paid $324,624.24.  But even applying the Master's "success"
approach I am of the view that it was the appellant
that had the measure of
"success" because it was challenging the totality of the $4 million debt and
the respondent withdrew the
Demand when the alternative figure for which the
appellant was contending in its Summons was paid.
<P>

48   	The relevant question was not whether the respondent had
been successful because the money had been paid but whether the proceedings,
the subject of the costs order, had been litigated in a manner to entitle one
party or another to a costs order.  In that regard
the appellant was the party
claiming that there was a genuine dispute about the alleged $4 million debt.
The appellant was also the
party claiming that the only amount owed was that
identified in the alternative order in the Summons.  
<P>

49   	On any view of the state of the evidence as at 30
September 1999 it was overwhelmingly in the appellant's favour to obtain
the
orders in the Summons but for the withdrawal of the Demand the day before.  It
was the appellant that obtained the success -
the withdrawal of the Demand.
<P>

50   	I agree with the appellants submissions that the Master
misdirected himself in focusing upon Mr Crawford's affidavit in deciding
that
the respondent was successful.  This "belief" had been overtaken by many
letters and telephone calls in which it must have been
abundantly clear that
the debt of $4 million odd was genuinely disputed.  
<P>

51   	Additionally there was never the slightest suggestion that
the appellant was unable to pay its debts and the Demand should
have been
withdrawn without the need for the appellant to litigate.  Far from playing
games with the respondent as Mr Dowdy submitted,
I am of the view that the
appellant sought meeting after meeting with the respondent to "confront" and
"deal" with the matter but
was not given the early opportunity to resolve it.

<P>

52   	The respondent waited until the day before the hearing to
withdraw the Demand and although it agreed three times to file evidence
in
support of its entitlement to the alleged debt and maintenance of the demand it
filed none.  It does not seem to me that it was
the appellant that was, as Mr
Dowdy put it, "playing games". 
<P>

53   	I am of the opinion that the Master fell into error in the
manner referred to above and the appeal should be upheld.  The
appeal is upheld
and I make the orders sought in the Notice of Appeal.  Order 1 in the Notice is
restricted to costs on an ordinary
basis as I am of the view that although this
is a borderline case I am not persuaded that it is a case for solicitor/client
costs.
