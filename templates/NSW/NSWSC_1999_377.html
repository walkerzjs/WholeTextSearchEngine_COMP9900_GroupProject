10375/99	<b>MIDDLE EAST GROUP PTY LIMITED t/as AMI MIGRATING CONSULTANTS   v
ALI MOHAMAD OSMAN &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Middle East Group Pty Limited is the plaintiff in these
proceedings and has applied by way of summons for the following
orders:
<P>

	<i>"1.	An order that the order made on 7 September 1998 by the Consumer Claims
Tribunal at Hurstville, NSW be quashed and set aside.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	An order that the Consumer Claims Tribunal grant a re-hearing of the
claim made by the Defendant, Ali Mohamad Osman."</i>
<P>

2	The plaintiff was not legally represented before this Court, but Mr Hanna, a
director of the plaintiff, appeared.  The defendant,
Ali Mohamad Osman,
appeared in person.  I ordered that the Consumer Claims Tribunal be joined as a
defendant and the matter was further
adjourned to enable the opportunity for
such joinder.  Subsequently Mr Ellis announced his appearance for the Tribunal.
Mr Ellis
has returned on the listing of this matter today and has filed in
Court a submitting appearance on behalf of the Tribunal.  In these
circumstances I have already indicated that I will proceed to deliver judgment
forthwith.
<P>

3	The only evidence placed before the Court was an affidavit on behalf of the
plaintiff sworn by Mr Hanna on 18 February 1999 and
the following documents:
<P>

(a)	A document described as "Movements Details", evidencing that Mr Hanna
departed from Australia on 26 August 1998 and returned
on 12 September 1998;
<P>

(b)	A copy of a notice of order of the Tribunal advising of the order made on 7
September 1998;
<P>

(c)	A letter from the Tribunal dated 21 September 1998.
<P>

4	It emerges from the evidence that:
<P>

(i)	In proceedings in the Consumer Claims Tribunal the plaintiff was ordered to
pay to the defendant the sum of $2500; that order
was made on 7 September
1998.
<P>

(ii)	On that date Mr Hanna was in Egypt on what he described in the affidavit
as <i>"urgent business"</i> that resulted in his absence from Australia from 26
August 1998 until 12 September 1998;
<P>

(iii)	In his absence there was no person who appeared before the Consumer
Claims Tribunal on 7 September 1998 to present the plaintiff's
case;
<P>

(iv)	When Mr Hanna learned on his return to Australia of the order that had
been made by the Consumer Claims Tribunal, he applied
to the Tribunal for a
re-hearing, on a form provided by the Tribunal.  The form provided for the
making of an affidavit by the plaintiff
and the basis of an application for a
re-hearing was addressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of that affidavit:
<P>

	<i>"4.	I was not present at the hearing</i>
<P>

<i>	and</i>
<P>

<i>	I was not represented by anyone</i>
<P>

<i>	and</i>
<P>

<i>	my case was not presented by affidavit or statutory declaration.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	I did not attend the hearing because:</i>
<P>

<i>	I was on an important and crucial business visit to Egypt.  I am a small
business owner and to keep my company running I had no other
alternative other
than travelling myself.  Also my present staff is not aware of the case and I
believe that justice can not be done
to my organisation and our sincere work.
I wish to be heard by honourable tribunal again."</i>
<P>

(v)	The application for a re-hearing was refused and the Tribunal wrote to the
plaintiff on 22 September 1998 in the terms following:
<P>

	<i>"I refer to the Consumer Claims Tribunal hearing held on 7/9/98 and your
application for a rehearing of this matter.</i>
<P>

<i>	Section 25(1) of the Consumer Claims Tribunals Act, 1987 provides that a
Tribunal may grant a request for a rehearing if satisfied
there was sufficient
reason for the party's absence at the previous hearing.</i>
<P>

<i>	The Tribunal has reviewed your application and has decided in this instance
not to grant a rehearing of this claim.  Therefore the
Tribunal Order of 7/9/98
is still in effect.</i>
<P>

<i>	Your only avenue of appeal in this matter is to the Supreme Court of New
South Wales.  Should you contemplate such action it is advisable
that you seek
legal advice."</i>
<P>

The plaintiff presumably acted on the content of the last paragraph of the
above letter in making application to this Court.
<P>

5	It appears from correspondence annexed to Mr Hanna's affidavit that the
proceedings in the Tribunal, in which Mr Osman was the
claimant, were first set
down for hearing on 3 August 1998 but that date was vacated for reasons which
do not appear.  A fresh hearing
date on 17 August 1998 was allocated.  However,
by letter dated 13 August 1998 the Tribunal advised that the hearing date was
to
change once more and that the matter was to be dealt with on 7 September
1998.  According to Mr Hanna's affidavit, the letter advising
of this September
date <i>"was dated 19th  August and was received in the plaintiff's office on
24th August 1998."</i>  That assertion is plainly incorrect, at least in part,
because the letter from the Tribunal annexed to the affidavit plainly carried
the date stamp 13 August 1998.  Be that as it may, the plaintiff received
notice of the new hearing date less than two weeks before
Mr Hanna was due to
depart for Egypt.
<P>

6	According to Mr Hanna's affidavit, he telephoned the Tribunal before he left
for Egypt but was advised that the hearing date set
for 7 September 1998 would
not be postponed.
<P>

7	I have set out above the entirety of the evidence placed before this Court by
the plaintiff.  Mr Osman produced no evidence.
<P>

8	The Act under which the Consumer Claims Tribunal functions is the <i>Consumer
Claims Tribunals Act</i>, 1987.  Under s 34 an order of a Tribunal is to be
final.  That section provides:
<P>

	<i>"An order of a tribunal is final and binding on all parties to a consumer
claim that is heard and determined by the tribunal and no
appeal lies in
respect of an order of the tribunal.  However, this does not prevent a claim
being renewed under section 36 and does
not prevent a court granting relief or
a remedy as referred to in section 12(2)."</i>
<P>

9	Consistently with s 34, s 12 of the statute provides for immunity of
decisions of the tribunal from judicial review other than
in the circumstances
set out in s 12(2).  Section 12 provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	Except as provided by subsection (2), a court of record has no
jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari
or other prerogative writ,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a declaratory judgment or order, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	an injunction,</i>
<P>

<i>	in respect of a consumer claim heard and determined or to be heard or
determined by a tribunal in accordance with this Act or in
respect of any
ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such a claim.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) if, in respect of a consumer
claim:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	a tribunal has given a ruling under section 26 or refused or failed to
give such a ruling after the jurisdiction of the tribunal
to hear and determine
the claim has been disputed by a party to the claim and the ground on which the
relief or remedy is sought
is that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the ruling was erroneous, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	the tribunal erred in refusing or failing to give the ruling after its
jurisdiction was disputed, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a tribunal has made an order under section 30 and the ground on which
the relief or remedy is sought is that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	in relation to the hearing or determination of the claim, a party to
the claim had been denied natural justice."</i>
<P>

10	In the present case the plaintiff applies to this Court claiming that there
has been a denial of natural justice and that in
this case it is accordingly
appropriate for this Court to intervene by granting the relief sought in the
summons.
<P>

11	The plaintiff complains that it was denied a reasonable opportunity of being
heard in this matter.  The authorities make it plain
that to deny a party to
proceedings a reasonable opportunity to be heard does constitute a denial of
natural justice.  This principle
is well settled and I refer only to the
following authorities.
<P>

12	In <i>Cameron v Cole</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1944/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2068%20CLR%20571" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 68 CLR 571</a> Rich J said at 589:
<P>

	<i>"It is a fundamental principle of natural justice, applicable to all
courts, whether superior or inferior, that a person against whom
a claim or
charge is made must be given a reasonable opportunity of appearing and
presenting his case."</i>
<P>

13	The above dicta were cited with approval in <i>Taylor v Taylor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%2d80%29%20143%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979-80)
143 CLR 1</a>, see in particular the judgment of Gibbs J at 7.
<P>

14	See also <i>Hoskins v Van Den-Braak</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 290</a> and in
particular the judgment of Mason P at 294.
<P>

15	Parties to proceedings in the Consumer Claims Tribunal are entitled to
natural justice as the scheme of that Act makes clear.
 Indeed s 12(2)
expressly recognises that a party to a claim in the Tribunal is entitled to
expect natural justice.  Section 17,
which provides that the Tribunal has
control of and responsibility for its own procedures, further provides in sub-s
(1) that <i>"in exercising its functions under this Act [a tribunal] must
conform to the rules of natural justice."</i>
<P>

16	Proceedings before a Consumer Claims Tribunal are of course less formal than
proceedings in a court but nevertheless the statute
contemplates that there
will be a hearing and s 23 contemplates that evidence may be given orally or in
writing at a hearing.  Sections
24 and 25 contemplate that the Tribunal may act
in the absence of evidence from a party.  Section 24 provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	Subject to section 25, if at the hearing of a consumer claim by a
tribunal the case of a party to the claim is not presented
to the
tribunal:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the tribunal must decide the issues in dispute on such evidence as is
otherwise adduced before it, and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	an order made by the tribunal to determine the claim is just as
effective as if that party had been fully heard.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	Subject to section 25, if none of the cases of the parties to a
consumer claim is presented to the tribunal at the time and place
fixed for the
hearing of the claim, or at the time and place to which the hearing of the
claim is adjourned, the tribunal must make
an order dismissing the
claim."</i>
<P>

17	Section 25, under which section the Tribunal acted in inviting the affidavit
which Mr Hanna completed on 14 September 1998 provides
in sub-s (1):
<P>

	<i>"(1)	If a tribunal has decided an issue in dispute in the absence of a
party to a consumer claim or a consumer claim has been dismissed
under section
24(2), a referee may, on application in the approved form lodged at the
registry within 14 days after receiving notice
of the decision or the order
dismissing the claim, order the claim to be reheard if satisfied that there was
sufficient reason for
the party's absence."</i>
<P>

18	On the evidence which has been placed before this Court, it has emerged that
the plaintiff was not heard in the proceedings before
the Tribunal.  Indeed on
that evidence I find that the plaintiff was not afforded a reasonable
opportunity to be heard.  I should
add that this was through no fault of Mr
Osman but nevertheless it is my finding that the plaintiff was not afforded a
reasonable
opportunity to be heard by the Tribunal.
<P>

19	Doubtless the demands upon the Tribunal's resources are taxing and it may
well be difficult to quickly accommodate a matter where
an adjournment becomes
necessary.  However the history of this claim indicates that when, for whatever
reason, it became necessary
to vacate the first hearing date on 3 August 1998
the Tribunal was able to allocate a new date fourteen days thereafter.  Then
when
it was necessary, again for whatever reason, to vacate that hearing date
it proved practicable for the Tribunal to accommodate the
matter three weeks
thereafter on 7 September 1998.  It is noted that on each of those occasions
that a hearing time was appointed
the time allowed for the hearing was one hour
so that to afford to the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard would have
required accommodation
for one hour at some time following Mr Hanna's return
from Egypt.
<P>

20	It seems to me on the evidence before this Court that the plaintiff was not
afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as
I have already indicated.  The
affidavit sworn by Mr Hanna on 14 September 1998, and to which I have referred,
on the face of it
showed sufficient reason for his absence at the earlier
appointed hearing date and, in the absence of any explanation for the decision
of the Tribunal not to grant a re-hearing, I conclude that the plaintiff has
established grounds for the relief sought in the summons.
 It seems to me that
the requirements of natural justice demand that the plaintiff be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard
by the Tribunal and that thus far such
opportunity has not been afforded to it.
<P>

21	Accordingly I make the orders sought in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the
summons.
<P>
