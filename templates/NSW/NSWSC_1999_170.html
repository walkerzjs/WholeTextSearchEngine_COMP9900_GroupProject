DECISION: 
<P>

See Paragraph 45.
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act
</i>1982</a>.
<P>

2	By summons filed on 9 December 1996 Muriel Betty Elliott, the plaintiff,
claims an order for provision out of the estate of the
late John George Elliott
(to whom I shall refer as "the deceased"). The plaintiff was the former wife of
the deceased, they having
been married from 1944 until 1975. 
<P>

3	It should here be noted that when the proceedings were instituted two
plaintiffs were named in the summons, being Muriel Betty
Elliott and her
daughter Stephanie Rae Elliott (a disable person who brought her proceedings
through her mother). It is unnecessary
for me to give consideration to the
claim for relief sought on behalf of that latter plaintiff, since Stephanie Rae
Elliott died
on 14 September 1998. (The plaintiff was the executor of and sole
beneficiary under Stephanie's will.)
<P>

4	The deceased died on 14 July 1995, aged 78. He left a will dated 21 June
1990, probate whereof was on 13 September 1994 granted
by the Supreme Court of
Queensland to Clive Hendry Longstaff, the executor named in such will (who is
the defendant to the present
proceedings). That grant was resealed in New South
Wales on 4 October 1996. 
<P>

5	The assets of the deceased (most of which have now been realised, but none of
which have yet been distributed) total in value
about $1,430,000. Among those
assets is a house property situate at and known as 38 Sydney Road, Concord,
which had been the matrimonial
home of the deceased and the plaintiff
throughout their marriage, and in which the plaintiff has continued to reside
since their
separation. A valuation of that house property (Exhibit 1) obtained
by the defendant shows the present value to be $390,000. The
deceased had
liabilities totalling about $82,000, resulting in a net estate of about
$1,348,000. When allowance is made for the costs
of the present proceedings and
for other expected administration expenses, the value of the distributable
estate will be about $1,285,000.

<P>

6	The deceased was born on 26 October 1916. On 20 January 1944 he married the
plaintiff. At the time of their marriage he was an
officer in the Royal
Australian Air Force (seconded to Qantas as a pilot), and had already qualified
as a chartered accountant. 
<P>

7	Although no children were born of their marriage, the deceased and the
plaintiff adopted a daughter Stephanie Rae (born 8 June
1948) and a daughter
Valerie Joan (born 3 July 1951). In addition, they also adopted a son Martin
Kenneth (born 30 August 1955).
However, Martin suffered from epilepsy, which
was detected quite early, and his adoption was rescinded. Stephanie was
intellectually
handicapped. Throughout her life, until her death on 14
September 1998, aged fifty, she lived with the plaintiff, by whom she was
cared
for and principally maintained.
<P>

8	In 1946 the deceased and the plaintiff acquired a house property at 38 Sydney
Road, Concord, which was to be their matrimonial
home throughout their marriage
and in which the plaintiff has continued to reside from the time of their
separation. That house property
was purchased in the name of the deceased
alone, for &#163;1,400.
<P>

9	The plaintiff (who was born on 29 July 1918 and is presently aged 80) had
grown up in various country districts in New South Wales,
and had left school
at the age of fifteen. Thereafter she worked as a governess on rural estates at
Jugiong, at Yass and at Hay,
and for about four years immediately before her
marriage she was employed in a general store at Griffith. 
<P>

10	At the time of their marriage the deceased had savings of about &#163;500
and the plaintiff had savings of about &#163;40. Neither
the plaintiff nor the
deceased owned any other property at that time. 
<P>

11	The plaintiff was not in employment throughout the marriage. She devoted the
entirety of her married life to being a full-time
wife and mother. Almost alone
she was responsible for the entirety of the duties and functions of homemaker
and parent, especially
in regard to Stephanie (who for the entirety of her life
required care and attention far greater than that required by a normal child).
The plaintiff had to maintain the household from an allowance given to her by
the deceased, which at the time of separation in 1972
was $200 a month. . On
occasion, when the plaintiff through her ability in domestic management and
housekeeping frugality, was able
to save something from her monthly allowance,
the deceased would suspend payment of that allowance for a period. He often
acknowledged
in writing that he had done so, but he did not ever reimburse the
plaintiff for those withheld amounts of her housekeeping allowance.
The
plaintiff estimated that those amounts would have totalled, over the years of
the marriage, about $20,000.
<P>

12	In 1965, when she was aged about seventeen, Stephanie commenced to receive
what was then known as an invalid pension (but later
called a disability
pension). Until the separation of the plaintiff and the deceased some seven
years later, the entirety of Stephanie's
pension was retained by the deceased
--- he told the plaintiff that he would bank it in an account in his own name,
and would hold
it in trust for Stephanie. The plaintiff estimated those pension
payments thus retained would have totalled about $20,000. However,
the deceased
never paid the amount of that pension to Stephanie or to the plaintiff, or
accounted to either of them for the amount
to which he had retained.
<P>

13	At a later stage Stephanie was able to work part-time in sheltered
employment. Shortly before her death she was receiving $18
for two days' work
each week. It was necessary for the plaintiff to drive Stephanie to and from
that sheltered employment. 
<P>

14	The younger daughter of the plaintiff and the deceased, Valerie Joan (known
in the family as Meg) lived with her parents until
her marriage in 1971, when
she was aged about twenty. Meg had completed Year 10 at Strathfield Girls High
School, and had subsequently
pursued a secretarial course. She was in
employment from 1969 until her marriage, paying $15 a week by way of board to
her parents.
At the time when Meg commenced work the deceased said that he
would invest for her the amount of that weekly board and that he would
give her
back the investment when she needed it. According to the plaintiff, in the
ensuing three years until her marriage Meg paid
a total of about $4,500 to her
father, but no part of that money was ever repaid to her.
<P>

15	The plaintiff's responsibilities as homemaker and parent, included all
cooking, washing, ironing, and general housekeeping duties,
for herself, the
deceased, Stephanie and (until she left home) Valerie, as well as managing the
household budget and the purchase
of all food and other household requirements.
She did the entirety of the family shopping. In addition she attended to the
gardens,
although occasionally the deceased mowed the lawns. It was rare for
the deceased to help with any of the housework. 
<P>

16	Shortly after the deceased retired from his employment with Qantas he
departed from the matrimonial home on 16 November 1972
(without any pre-warning
to the plaintiff). They were divorced on 31 July 1975, and consent orders were
made in relation to maintenance
and property.
<P>

17	Pursuant to those consent orders the plaintiff received:
<P>

	(a)	A life interest in the Concord house property.
<P>

	(b)	Maintenance of $55 a week.
<P>

	(c)	Interest in a life insurance policy (stated by the 	deceased to have a
surrender value of $4,000).
<P>

	(d)	The sum of $1,000
<P>

18	The evidence discloses that after their divorce a continuing relationship
existed between the plaintiff and the deceased. In
addition to the weekly
spousal maintenance (the payment of which appears to have been somewhat
irregular, and to have required, at
times, prompting by the plaintiff), the
deceased from time to time gave to the plaintiff various amounts of money and
financial assistance.
He paid for certain electrical appliances (including a
television, a video receiver and a microwave oven) and other household items,
as well as the cost of certain carpeting and painting work for the house. On
two occasions, in 1980 and again in 1990, he gave to
her the sum of $10,000, to
assist the plaintiff in the purchase of a new motor car. The deceased paid her
membership fees for the
Concord Golf Club, of about $1,000 a year. The deceased
also gave to the plaintiff a set of good quality golf clubs, a golf bag,
and
two rings. 
<P>

19	The deceased also maintained a continuing and affectionate relationship with
his daughter Stephanie. It would appear, however,
that once he left the family
home the deceased made no financial contribution towards Stephanie's
maintenance, although from that
time Stephanie's pension was paid directly to
her and was no longer retained by her father.
<P>

20	In 1979 the deceased married Doris Sinclair Elliott, who died on 13 May
1993, during the lifetime of the deceased. The plaintiff
said that after the
death of his second wife the deceased telephoned her and said, "I would still
like to be married to you". The
plaintiff regarded that statement as being
close to an apology by the deceased for his conduct towards her. During the
last few months
of his life the deceased telephoned the plaintiff regularly,
and the plaintiff described him as being very pleasant in those
conversations.
<P>

21	By his will the deceased appointed Clive Hendry Longstaff (the husband of a
deceased niece of the deceased) as his executor.
He gave a legacy of $50,000 to
the plaintiff and a legacy of $20,000 to the defendant. The deceased gave a
life estate in the house
property at Concord to the plaintiff and their
daughter Stephanie, with the remainder to the defendant. The residue of the
estate
was given to the deceased's second wife absolutely, but in the event
(which happened) that she did not survive the deceased, then
the residue was to
be divided into six equal shares, one such share to pass to each of five named
great-nephews and great-nieces
of the deceased, and the final share to be held
by the defendant on a discretionary trust for Stephanie for life, with
remainder
to the defendant. 
<P>

22	The practical effect of the provisions of the will, in so far as they
concern the plaintiff, is that she receives a legacy of
$50,000 and a life
estate in the house property. She is responsible for the payment of all
outgoings in respect to that house property.
<P>

23	At the present time the plaintiff has the following assets:
<P>

	(a)	Life interest in the house property at 38 Sydney 	Street, Concord)
<P>

	(b)	1990 Nissan Pulsar sedan motor car (estimated value,	$7,000)
<P>

	(c)	Furniture and household effects (estimated value, 	$5,000)
<P>

	(d)	Advantage saver account, Westpac - $2,452
<P>

	(e)	Commonwealth Bank of Australia account - $3,724
<P>

	(f)	Commonwealth Bank of Australia account - $26,884
<P>

	(g)	Interest in estate of Stephanie Elliott - $25,258.
<P>

	(h)	Legacy of $50,000, plus interest, under the will of the 	deceased (which
legacy has not yet been paid).
<P>

24	The plaintiff has no liabilities.
<P>

25	The plaintiff's sole income consists of the age pension (which she has been
receiving since about 1980), which is presently in
an amount of $362.70 a
fortnight; together with a very small amount of interest earned by the moneys
held in the above bank accounts.
<P>

26	Whilst Stephanie was alive, she and the plaintiff were in the practice of
pooling their resources. It is now necessary for the
plaintiff to meet the
entirety of all her household and personal expenses from her own income.
<P>

27	The plaintiff as a former wife of the deceased is an eligible person within
paragraph (c) of the definition of that phrase contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, she has the standing to bring the
present proceedings.
<P>

28	However, since she is an eligible person only within paragraph (c) of that
definition, it is necessary for the plaintiff to satisfy
the requirements of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i> which provides,
<P>

	Where an application is made for an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> by an eligible
person who is such a person by reason only of paragraph (c) or (d) of the
definition of "eligible person" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1), the Court shall first
determine whether, in its opinion, having regard to all the circumstances of
the case (whether past or
present), there are factors which warrant the making
of the application and shall refuse to proceed with the determination of the
application and to make the order unless it is satisfied that there are those
factors.
<P>

29	The plaintiff submits that there are those factors, and in that regard
relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Churton v Christian</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 241.</a> In that case Priestley JA, concerning a claim by a former
wife, said, at 254,
<P>

	The matters I have mentioned regarding the relationship of Mr and Mrs
Christian after their separation and divorce seem to me to
be factors which
warrant Mrs Christian's making of an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. They seem to me to show that the separation and
divorce did not completely sever Mrs Christian's relationship with her former
husband
and that she was in a position different from that of a woman of whose
relationship with her former husband all that is known is
the fact of the
divorce. The circumstances make applicable to her the description of a person
who might well, to use McLelland J's
words, be "regarded as a natural object of
testamentary recognition" by the deceased.
<P>

30	The plaintiff also relies upon the following passage of the judgment of
Master Macready in <i>Lynch v. Lynch</i> (24 August 1992, unreported),
<P>

	Although I do not relish the thought of numerous attacks in the future upon
Family Court deeds, it does seem to me that the demonstrable
unfairness
(although upon legal advice) of the settlement is a factor warranting the
making of the application.
<P>

31	In the instant case the plaintiff points to the following matters as
constituting factors warranting the making of the application.
Firstly, the
property settlement of 1975 overwhelmingly favoured the deceased. He was left
with all of his assets other than a life
interest in the Concord property and
the proceeds of a modest insurance company. 
<P>

32	Further, the relationship between the parties continued after the
dissolution of their marriage and up to the death of the deceased.
Part of that
relationship was concerned with the deceased's obligations to make maintenance
payments to the plaintiff. In addition,
the plaintiff had the care of their
child Stephanie, and it is clear that the deceased was also interested in
Stephanie's well-being.
But the relationship went further, however, because the
deceased provided financial assistance, in addition to the maintenance
payments,
to the plaintiff, whereby she able to purchase a motor vehicle and
subsequently to replace that motor vehicle (the plaintiff still
drives that
latter vehicle), and whereby she was also able to maintain her membership of a
golf club. Most importantly, it must be
appreciated that the deceased by his
will made provision for the plaintiff. 
<P>

33	The defendant in disputing that there are such factors warranting the making
of the application relied upon the unreported decision
of Cohen J in
<i>Graziani v. Graziani </i>(20 February 1987), where His Honour commented that
the relevant factors are those suggesting that there may have been a duty to
the
person within the class affected of a like kind to the duty generally
considered to exist in relation to persons within the classes
of eligible
persons not affected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> (1). 
<P>

34	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the fact that the deceased
left a legacy to the plaintiff in no way determines
the matter. A testator may
be very fond of a person and quite close to that person and may provide for
that person in his will; but,
so it was submitted, those facts do not make such
a person (in this case, the plaintiff) a natural object of the testamentary
bounty
of the testator. 
<P>

35	The defendant submitted that the consent orders concerning spousal
maintenance and property settlement made between the parties
at the time of the
dissolution of their marriage on 31 July 1975 (which was almost twenty years
before the death of the deceased)
for all practical purposes terminated any
relationship between the parties, and that the contact between the parties
thereafter was
essentially in consequence of the responsibilities accepted by
the deceased and reflected in the terms of those consent orders. In
this regard
the defendant relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Dijkhuijs v
Barclay</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20639" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 639</a>, and, in particular, the judgment of Kirby P at
650-651. The defendant submitted that the continued contact by the plaintiff
could
not be regarded as a factor warranting the bringing of the present
proceedings. However, in <i>Franke v Public Trustee</i> <i>(No. 2)</i> (Court
of Appeal, 16 April 1993, unreported) Clarke JA (with whose reasons Kirby P
agreed) regarded the lack of a continuing relationship
between a former wife
and the testator to be a relevant consideration in concluding that there were
no factors warranting the making
the application.
<P>

36	Despite the foregoing submissions on behalf of the defendant, I am satisfied
that the continued contact between the plaintiff
and the deceased for the last
twenty years of the deceased's lifetime, the financial assistance and benefits
which the deceased afforded
to the plaintiff beyond those required of him by
the terms of the consent orders made in the matrimonial proceedings between
them,
the testamentary provisions made by the deceased for the plaintiff by his
will, and, in addition, the fact that the matrimonial orders
overwhelmingly
favoured the deceased at the expense of the plaintiff, all constitute factors
which, in my view, warrant the making
of the present application by the
plaintiff. I also regard the strength of the plaintiff's present claim as
constituting a further
factor warranting the making of the application.
<P>

37	Accordingly, it becomes necessary for me to proceed to a consideration of
the claim of the plaintiff for an order for provision
for her maintenance.
<P>

38	I consider it to be relevant to the plaintiff's claim that throughout the
marriage of the plaintiff and the deceased, for the
period of twenty-eight
years until their separation, it was to an extent as a result of the
contributions made by the plaintiff,
as a loving and devoted mother to the two
children, one of whom was retarded, and as a responsible and full-time
homemaker, who showed
herself to be a careful and frugal manager of the
household expenses, that the deceased was enabled to build up his assets, and
to
acquire what was, at the time of his death, a not insubstantial estate. 
<P>

39	The plaintiff is currently content to remain in the house property at
Concord, which has been her residence for the past 52 years.
However, it was
submitted on her behalf that the life interest given to her in that house
property by the will of the deceased does
not accommodate the possibility that,
as she advances in years, that house property may not be suitable or
appropriate to her needs.
It will be appreciated that by the will the plaintiff
has a life interest, not a mere right of residence, and that, in consequence,
were she no longer to live in that property she would still be entitled to rent
it out and retain any income from such rental. But
in such circumstances, any
income which she might derive from the Concord house property, added to her
other assets, still would
not be sufficient to enable her to acquire other
accommodation of her own --- other than, possibly, rented accommodation.
<P>

40	The present need of the plaintiff is for security and flexibility in her
accommodation. She presently has security, but not flexibility.

<P>

41	I am of the view that it is appropriate that the plaintiff should receive
the Concord house property absolutely. Thus she would
be enabled, if that
property were to become unsuitable for her needs or circumstances, to dispose
of that property and to acquire
some other property of her choice.
<P>

42	The present income of the plaintiff and her other assets, together with the
legacy of $50,000 which is given to her by the will
of the deceased, are such
as will enable her to live at a standard appropriate to that which she has
enjoyed since her divorce from
the deceased, and still to retain a fund to meet
contingencies.
<P>

43	The entitlement of the plaintiff to relief along the foregoing lines must,
however, be considered in the light of any competing
claims of other persons
upon the testamentary bounty of the deceased. The only other eligible person in
relation to the deceased
is, apart from the plaintiff, their daughter Valerie
Joan Knight (who although served with a notice of claim, has not herself made
any claim in respect to her father's estate). Neither Mrs. Knight nor any of
the beneficiaries has placed before the Court any evidence
concerning her or
his financial and material circumstances. Neither has any submission been made
by the defendant that the circumstances
of any of the beneficiaries are such as
would have the effect of reducing, or even extinguishing, any order for
provision an entitlement
to which the plaintiff might otherwise have
established.
<P>

44	At the conclusion of the hearing Counsel for the respective parties
requested that I make no order as to costs until I have published
my decision
in this matter, and the parties have had an opportunity of making submissions
concerning costs in the light of that decision.

<P>

45	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1. 	I order that, in lieu of the provision made for her by clause 3 (c) of the
will of the late John George Elliott ("the deceased"),
the defendant hold the
house property at 38 Sydney Street, Concord, for the plaintiff absolutely.
