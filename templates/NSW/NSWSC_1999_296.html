<b>1 APRIL 1999</b>
<P>

<center><b><u>30003/99 - Clayton Robert CROKER  v  Edward PERKS &amp;
Anor</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In these proceedings the plaintiff, Clayton Robert
Croker, seeks to set aside orders made in the Residential Tenancies Tribunal
on
4 December 1998 dismissing his application before that Tribunal for monetary
compensation for an allegedly wrongful eviction from
premises of which he
claimed to be a tenant under a residential tenancy agreement and the return of
some property said to belong
to him.
<P>

2	The grounds on which the application was dismissed was that the Tribunal
concluded that the premises operated as a boarding house
and consequently it
had no jurisdiction.
<P>

3	In preparation for the hearing of the proceedings the plaintiff issued a
subpoena addressed to the Australian Taxation Office
seeking production of the
following:
<P>

	A.  Taxation records showing the status of the taxation applied to the
premises 	of 33 Cooper Street, Surry Hills, Sydney 2010
(low cost accommodation
tax 	etc). 
<P>

	B.  Taxation records showing the employment of employees at 33 Cooper 	Street,
Surrey Hills, Sydney 2010.
<P>

4	The subpoena has not been complied with and the plaintiff subsequently filed
a Notice of Motion seeking an order that the subpoena
issued to the Australian
Taxation Department be complied with in full. That Notice of Motion was filed
on 3 March 1999.
<P>

5	In the meantime, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation filed a Notice of Motion
on 25 February 1999 seeking an order that the subpoena
be set aside and other
relief.
<P>

6	Section 16 (3) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</a></i></b> provides
that an officer shall not be required to produce in court any return,
assessment or notice of assessment or to divulge or
communicate to any court
any matter or thing coming under his notice in the performance of his duties as
an officer, except when
it is necessary to do so for the purpose of carrying
into effect the provisions of that Act or of any previous law of the
Commonwealth
relating to Income Tax.
<P>

7	These proceedings do not involve the carrying into effect of the provisions
of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</a></i></b> or any previous law of the
Commonwealth relating to Income Tax and consequently the exception does not
apply. It follows that the
Commissioner or anyone employed by him cannot be
required to produce to this Court the documents the subject of the subpoena.
<P>

8	Mr Croker, who has appeared in person, has referred me to a number of cases
where it has been held that the exception referred
to in the section applied,
including <b><i>Norper Investments Pty Ltd  v  Deputy Federal Commissioner for
Taxation</i></b> (1977) 77 ATC 4211, <b><i>Krew  v  Federal Commissioner for
Taxation</i></b> (1971) 71 ATC 4091, <b><i>Hutchins  v  Federal Commissioner
for Taxation</i></b> (1986), 86 ATC 4549, <b><i>Nestle Australia Limited  v
Federal Commissioner for Taxation </i></b>(1986) 86 ATC 4499. Those cases,
however, were all cases where the issue was either the liability of a party for
tax or the enforcement
of such liability.  As I have already said, these
proceedings do not relate to carrying into effect the purposes of this Act or
any
other Commonwealth Act relating to income tax and consequently the
exception does not apply.
<P>

9	Mr Croker has also submitted he is entitled to the production of the
documents under the <b><i>Freedom of Information Act (Cth) 1982</i></b> but he
has not made an application under that Act and if he does it will no doubt be
dealt with on its merits, although I anticipate
that the application will be
refused pursuant to the exception provided in that Act, s 38(1) and Schedule 3
which in turn refers
to s 16 (2) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment
Act</a></i></b>.
<P>

10	For these reasons the plaintiff's Notice to Produce is dismissed and on the
Notice of Motion filed by the Deputy Commissioner
for Taxation I make order 1
as asked.  I order the plaintiff to pay the costs of both motions.
<P>
