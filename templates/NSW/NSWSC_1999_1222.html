<P>

<b>Tuesday, 14 December 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>70001/99 - REGINA v RPA</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> On 15 December 1998 the prisoner, whom I shall
refer to by his initials RPA, was committed to this Court for trial on a number
of
serious offences, including murder and several counts of aggravated robbery.
On 1 October 1999 the Crown presented an indictment
containing two counts and
the prisoner pleaded guilty to them both.  They were that on 9 March 1998 at
Marrickville he robbed Toan
Van Doan of a gold chain, a wallet and some money
and at the same time used corporal violence upon him and that at the same time
and place he robbed Cong Hai Nguyen of a television receiver, a video cassette
recorder, some hi-fi equipment, two leather jackets,
a gold chain, a telephone
and a wallet and at the same time used corporal violence upon him.
<P>

2  	The prisoner was arrested on 1 April 1998 and held in custody,
bail refused, until he entered into conditional bail on 28 October
1998.
During the currency of that bail he committed further offences and on 18
November 1999 a magistrate committed him to this Court
for sentence for five
offences.  They were that on 13 February 1999 at Yagoona whilst in company with
a person I shall refer to as
RP he robbed LJ Hooker Pty Limited of cash in the
sum of $1,500, that on 15 February 1999 at Peakhurst whilst in the company of
RP
and a person I shall refer to as MB he robbed Forest Real Estate Pty Limited
of cash in the sum of $80 and a mobile telephone, that
on 17 February 1999 at
Beverly Hills whilst in the company of RP and MB he robbed Robert Seib of a
telephone and cash to the total
value of $70, that on 22 February 1999 at
Chester Hill, whilst in the company of RP and MB he robbed The Professionals
Real Estate
Pty Limited of cash in the sum of $1,520 and a camera and that on
26 February 1999 at Berala, whilst in the company of RP, he robbed
The
Professionals Real Estate Pty Limited of cash in the sum of $13,175.
<P>

3  	The prisoner maintained his pleas of guilty in this Court and
asked the Court to take into account pursuant to s 21 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act
1986</a> eleven further offences, nine of them constituting robbery in company and
the remaining two taking and driving a conveyance without
consent.
<P>

4  	On 9 March 1998 the prisoner and six other youths or young men
went together to a house in Marrickville where Cong Hai Nguyen
lived, intending
to buy heroin from him.  The others were Aaron Anderson, Michael Poa, David
Hooker and three youths to whom I shall
refer by their initials, which are PS,
SB and KMD.
<P>

5  	A man called Duc Hoang Do was visiting Mr Nguyen at the time.
The prisoner and his colleagues purchased and smoked heroin and
while that was
going on one of them suggested that they rob Mr Nguyen and Mr Do.  They all
agreed.  As Mr Do walked into the lounge
room from the kitchen he was punched
by Michael Poa and knocked across the room.  He was there punched and kicked
and lay unconscious
in the corner of the room.  Mr Nguyen entered the lounge
room and he too was attacked, being kicked and punched in the face and in
the
head.  His trousers were ripped as his attackers removed his wallet and he was
kicked in the chest.  Some of the offenders began
to remove property from the
flat.  As that happened Mr Nguyen managed to get away.
<P>

6  	During the course of the robbery Toan Van Doan, another friend of
Mr Nguyen entered the flat.  He was forcibly carried into
a bedroom and
attacked.  He lost consciousness.
<P>

7  	During the attack David Hooker was searching a lounge chair,
hoping to find concealed drugs, and found a large knife.  He used
it to stab Mr
Do and Mr Doan.  Mr Do died of his wounds and Mr Doan was seriously hurt.  He
had to have thirty-seven sutures to the
head and had to undergo an operation to
remove a blood clot from his brain.
<P>

8  	The belongings which I mentioned earlier in summarising the
charges were removed by the attackers and they all got away in a
car.
<P>

9  	Although the prisoner joined in the attack and was thereby
responsible for the punching and kicking of Mr Doan and Mr Nguyen
it is no part
of the Crown case that the prisoner personally caused any injury.  Of course,
the finding of the knife by Hooker was
never contemplated by the prisoner and
it has not been suggested that he is responsible for injuries inflicted by its
use.
<P>

10  	I accept that the attack was launched on the spur of the moment
and that the original intent of the prisoner in going to the
flat was to
purchase heroin.
<P>

11  	On 13 February 1999 the prisoner, MB and RP went into a real
estate office at Yagoona.  The prisoner was armed with a knife.
 The offenders
threatened the occupiers, searched the premises and took $1,500 from a cash
tin.
<P>

12  	On 15 February 1999 the prisoner and the same two companions
entered a real estate office at Peakhurst and stole at knife point
the sum of
$80 and a mobile phone.
<P>

13  	On 17 February 1999 the same three offenders entered a real
estate office at Beverly Hills.  The prisoner produced a knife
and the three
stole $70 and a mobile telephone.
<P>

14  	On 22 February 1999 the prisoner, MB, RP and two others entered
a real estate office at Chester Hill.  One was armed with a
knife.  $1,520 in
cash and a camera were stolen.
<P>

15  	On 26 February 1999 the prisoner, MB and RP entered a real
estate office at Berala.  One of them was armed with a knife.  $13,175
in cash
was taken.
<P>

16  	At the time of the Yagoona robbery mobile telephones were taken
from two persons present on the premises, and those two robberies
were the
first items the Court was asked to take into account.  Four further matters
which the Court was asked to take into account
comprised the theft of $500
together with a wallet and papers from the business at Peakhurst on 15 February
1999, the theft of a
watch, a wallet and $20 from the Beverly Hills business on
17 February 1999, the theft of a mobile telephone and $400 at the same
time and
place and the theft of $380 from the Chester Hill premises on 22 February
1999.
<P>

17  	Certain other offences which the Court was asked to take into
account were not directly connected with any of the matters to
which the
prisoner pleaded guilty.  They were that in a robbery of a similar kind on 15
February 1999 in a real estate office at
Riverwood a camera was taken, that at
the same time and place a mobile telephone was taken and that at Mortdale on
the same day,
in a robbery of a similar kind, the sum of $70 was taken.
<P>

18  	The final two items the Court was asked to take into account
concerned the taking and driving of two motor vehicles which were
used to carry
out one or more of the robberies.
<P>

19  	The prisoner was born in New Zealand on 22 October 1980, the
third eldest of nine children.  His parents were of Samoan and
New Zealand
background.  The family moved to Australia when the prisoner was two years old.
His parents were hard workers.  Nothing
remarkable is reported about the
prisoner's early childhood, though it is said that he was shy and continues to
be so.  He progressed
through primary school to high school and developed
normal friendships.  He became very close to his mother.
<P>

20  	Although the matter is not entirely clear, it appears as though
his father used to discipline him harshly.  He was charged
on one occasion with
the assault of the prisoner.
<P>

21  	About the time the prisoner was in year 9 at high school he was
suspended because of an assault on another student.  He denied
being solely
responsible.  He acknowledged to officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice
that he had lost interest in school
at that time.  This led to his leaving
school early in year 9 in 1995.
<P>

22  	The prisoner's mother had a job packing food for an airline and
his father was employed as a demolition labourer.  The prisoner
was able to
obtain part-time work in both of those occupations.
<P>

23  	The prisoner's friends tended to be Fijian, Tongan or Samoan and
he met them at or through school.  He began to offend whilst
he was in the
company of one or more of them.  He began to experiment with drugs and
ultimately became dependent on drugs, needing
to raise money to purchase them.
That he could only do, as he saw it, by resorting to crime.  During 1995 he
began binge drinking
of alcohol, mainly beer.  He would become very drunk and
get involved in fights.  In May 1995 he was given six months' probation
on
charges of assault and having the custody of an offensive implement.  In
January 1996 he was found to have committed ten offences
of breaking, entering
and stealing, two of stealing motor vehicles, one of resisting police and one
of entering a dwelling with intent
to steal.  He was given the benefit of a
bond and parental supervision for a period of six months.
<P>

24  	In May 1996 he was given twelve months' probation and fined for
using a conveyance and driving whilst unlicensed.  He was dealt
with again for
a similar offence in August of the same year.  Two months later he was dealt
with for threatening an injury to resist
arrest and was given a two year bond
with supervision and a six month control order.
<P>

25  	During 1996 the prisoner found himself at Mount Penang Juvenile
Justice Centre and satisfactorily completed a period of parole,
notwithstanding
some difficulty he had had earlier with unsatisfactory reports about his
response to supervision.
<P>

26  	He began experimenting with cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy in
1997 and 1998.  He began using heroin at the end of 1997 and at
one stage was
spending $500 per day on it.
<P>

27  	Following his arrest on 1 April 1998 for the offences committed
at Marrickville the prisoner was kept at Kariong Juvenile Justice
Centre.  His
behaviour in custody was generally satisfactory, although he was considered as
having only limited involvement in programs
or with counselling services.
Similar reports have been made about his custody at Parklea Correctional Centre
since his re-arrest
on 5 March 1999.
<P>

28  	When the police asked the prisoner about the offences that took
place at Marrickville he admitted his involvement straight
away.  He named
others who had taken part and gave what proved to be a substantially truthful
version of events.  He took the police
to the premises and showed them where
and how events had happened.  He said that he was sorry for what had happened,
particularly
the death and injury of the two young men.
<P>

29  	The officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice who have had
the duty and responsibility of supervising him and reporting
upon him are of
the opinion, which I accept, that his expressions of remorse were genuine.
<P>

30  	The authors of the background report, which was furnished to the
Court, appear to consider a period of full-time custody inevitable.
 Counsel
for the prisoner made no submission to the contrary.
<P>

31  	It may be accepted that the reason why the prisoner involved
himself in these offences was to obtain money to buy heroin. 
It may also be
accepted, as stated in the background report of Ms Stamos and Ms Duncan, that
the prisoner must control and overcome
his desire to use drugs if he is not to
continue to offend.
<P>

32  	The prisoner has learned by childhood experiences to resort to
the use of violence and threats in order to obtain what he wants.
 The
combination with drug addiction has put him firmly in the way of criminal
activity.  His addiction to drugs may be partly explained
by his childhood
experiences.  He appears to have an abiding sense of hopelessness and it is
essential that he become engaged in
counselling over his drug use and his use
of violence to achieve his aims.  It will be necessary to impose a sentencing
regime which
requires him to spend a considerable amount of time in custody,
but if he is to become rehabilitated he will have to be given the
chance of an
extended period under supervision on parole.
<P>

33  	In sentencing the prisoner for the Marrickville offences I
intend to impose concurrent sentences of effective full-time custody,
allowing
for the time the prisoner was at large on bail between 28 October 1998 and his
re-arrest on 5 March 1999.  I shall allow
for his pleas of guilty and for his
realistic and truthful answers to questions asked of him.  The fact that he
later re-offended
, I think, does not preclude an acceptance that he had a
degree of remorse, which was partly responsible for his pleas of guilty.
Because the prisoner was being held on bail within the juvenile justice system
he was denied the full benefits of the sentencing
regimes available under the
Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, and I shall take that matter into account
in assessing the length
of sentences to be imposed.
<P>

34  	Of course, subsequent events, resulting in his re-arrest, have
made it out of the question to impose any less than a full-time
custodial
sentence for the Marrickville offences, but they should be made shorter because
of the considerations I have mentioned.
 I take into account his age and the
fact that although he has been dealt with under the criminal system before it
has always been
under the juvenile system.  This is his first service in an
adult prison.
<P>

35  	I shall accumulate the sentences which I impose for the five
offences committed after the prisoner's release to bail.  The
totality of his
criminality comprised seven separate attacks on the staff of real estate
agents' offices carried out over a two-week
period in order to raise money to
buy drugs to feed an addition.  There were two incidental but important
offences comprised in the
theft and use of the cars during the course of the
commission of some of those offences.  All the offences were committed whilst
the prisoner was at liberty on bail and under an obligation to be of good
behaviour and were the more serious for that.
<P>

36  	The robberies on the offices of the real estate agents were very
serious.  Because they were carried out in company each attracts
a maximum
sentence of twenty-five years' penal servitude.  Fortunately, nobody was
injured but innocent people going about their
business were put in great
fear.
<P>

37  	Although no evidence was put before the Court, I am prepared to
deal with the prisoner on the understanding that he has some
remorse for the
second group of offences, as evidenced by his pleas of guilty, and that he
wishes seriously to tackle the many problems
which confront him.
<P>

38  	I propose to impose fixed term control orders for the first two
offences.  It is now too late to allow a probation period.
<P>

39  	In accumulating the sentences for the second group of offences
my intention is to produce an effective overall sentence somewhat
less than
would otherwise have resulted if each group of sentences had been imposed
without regard to the other.
<P>

40  	The accumulation of sentences is a further reason for the
imposition of an extended period of time during which the prisoner
will be
eligible for release on parole.
<P>

41  	RPA, for the robbery with corporal violence of Toan Van Doan and
for the robbery with corporal violence of Cong Hai Nguyen
I commit you to the
control of the Minister administering the Children (Detention Centres) Act for
two fixed terms each of one year
and three months.  Each term will be taken to
have commenced on 1 April 1998 and to have expired on 30 June 1999.
<P>

42  	For the robbery in company of LJ Hooker Pty Limited on 13
February 1999 at Yagoona I sentence you to penal servitude for six
years.  The
sentence comprises a minimum term of three years and six months, which will be
taken to have commenced on 1 July 1999
and which will expire on 31 December
2002, and an additional term of two years and six months, which will commence
on 1 January 2003
and expire on 30 June 2005.  You will be eligible for release
on parole on 31 December 2002.  In imposing sentence I have taken into
account
the several other offences I have summarised under the provisions of s 21
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act</a>.
<P>

43  	For the remaining offences, namely the robbery at Forest Real
Estate Pty Limited Peakhurst on 15 February 1999, the robbery
of Robert Seib at
Beverly Hills on 17 February 1999, the robbery at The Professionals Real Estate
Pty Limited at Chester Hill on
22 February 1999 and the robbery at The
Professionals Real Estate Pty Limited at Berala on 26 February 1999 I sentence
you to terms
of penal servitude each of five years.  Each sentence will
comprise a minimum term of three years six months, which will be taken
to have
commenced on 1 July 1999 and which will expire on 31 December 2002 and an
additional term of one year six months, during
which you will be eligible for
release on parole, commencing on 1 January 2003 and expiring on 30 June
2004.
