<b>THE CENTRAL ISSUES</b>
<P>

1   	The owner Mr Bailey and his related lessee company (First
and Second Plaintiffs respectively) each claim damages solely in
negligence
against their architect and their engineer (First and Second Defendants
respectively) for loss from the collapse under
high winds of an industrial
complex of three units at Unanderra.  I shall refer to the First Defendant
Redebi Pty Limited as "the
Architect" and to the Second Defendant Sherson &amp;
Associates Pty Limited as "the Engineer".  This collapse led to the complete
demolition and rebuilding of the complex.  Responsibility for the collapse can
be attributed at least in a "but for" sense to a wall
being erroneously treated
by Engineer and Architect in its engineering design and construction as an
internal wall.  It had to serve
structurally as an external wall, due to the
construction being staged and the wall was insufficiently stabilised to do so.
This
staging was known to the Architect and was sufficiently made known to the
Engineer.  The amount of the damage for consequential economic
loss is agreed
at $662,680 (plus any further interest).  The claim against the Engineer is for
failure in design of the structural
elements.  That against the Architect
focuses on the Architect's procurement and supervisory role in relation to
engineering design,
including an alleged communication failure on the
Architect's part vis a vis the Engineer and in allowing the builder to leave
the
wall as an internal wall.  The case throws up the issue of where an
architect's responsibility ends and a structural engineer's begins,
but in
circumstances where it is said that the Architect's role and responsibility as
a "design and building consultant" extended
at least to the functions just
described.
<P>

2   	The claim is resisted firstly on the basis of the owner's
alleged failure to respond reasonably to engineering reports from
other sources
received before the building collapsed.  That alleged failure in turn is relied
upon as a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> interrupting causation, or else as
aggravating damage or failing to mitigate it, or as the basis for contributory
negligence on the
owner's part.  The owner disputes the adequacy of any warning
and the efficacy of the remedial action suggested or recommended in
those
reports.  The Architect but not the Engineer denies any responsibility for that
aspect of the design which led to the collapse.
 The Architect alone pleaded
the statute of limitations.  The Engineer belatedly sought to do so, but only
after evidence had closed
and at the conclusion of oral addresses over a month
later.  That application was refused, for reasons set out in my judgment of
12
August 1999.
<P>

<b>OVERVIEW AND PRINCIPAL CONTENTIONS</b>
<P>

3   	Mr Stephen Floyd Bailey ("the First Plaintiff") has at all
material times been the owner of a piece of land located at 36 Investigator
Drive, Unanderra, New South Wales.  The First Plaintiff is the managing
director of Baileys Diesel Services Pty Limited ("the company"),
which is the
Second Plaintiff in these proceedings.  The company has been the lessee of the
premises for seven years and thus at
the material time.  It was not disputed
that the First Plaintiff's actions or inactions could be attributed to the
Second Plaintiff.
 Nor was it contended that the Second Plaintiff was not in
contemplation so far as any tortious claim was concerned (including as
regards
any dealings with the First Plaintiff).
<P>

4   	This dispute arises following the construction work carried
out on the 36 Investigator Drive property commenced in late 1990.
 Each of the
Defendants were earlier engaged for the purpose of designing and advising as
consultants for the building of industrial
warehouse units on the property.
The First Defendant, Redebi Pty Limited, trading as PR Design Co ("the
Architect") was a design
and building consultant under contract to the First
Plaintiff.  The Second Defendant, Sherson &amp; Associates Pty Limited, ("the
Engineer") was a firm of chartered structural engineers, engaged through (to
use a neutral term) the First Defendant.
<P>

5   	On 6 November 1994 the western wall of the building works
the subject of this dispute collapsed under the force of strong winds.
 As a
result, a large part of the rest of the building, being of brick construction
with a metal roof, also collapsed.  The Plaintiffs
bring an action, now solely
in tort, against both Architect and Engineer, having abandoned an earlier
action in contract against
the Architect.
<P>

6   	The Architect has subsequently brought a cross claim
against the Engineer.  The Engineer has, in turn, brought two further
cross-claims, the first against the Architect and the second against Kenna
&amp; Brown Pty Limited (in liquidation), the builder
of the subject
constructions.
<P>

7   	The cross-claims as between the Architect and the Engineer
were settled.  Nor am I concerned with any claim against the builder.
 Thus if
the Architect (or Engineer) is found liable to the Plaintiffs there is no need
for the Court to apportion liability between
the Architect and the Engineer.
The issues originally raised in these proceedings with respect to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s92</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act </i>1979</a> (NSW) do not now need to
be dealt with.  Nor in the negligence claim is there any longer an issue based
on whether the Plaintiffs
voluntarily assumed the relevant risk of collapse.
This issue has been subsumed in the issues of contributory negligence and
mitigation.
<P>

8   	The relevant action in tort was brought against the
Architect on 21 May 1998.  The limitation period of six years is measured
from
the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the Plaintiffs;  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14(1)</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</i> 1969</a> (NSW).
<P>

<b>Factual Background</b>
<P>

9   	In May 1989 the First Defendant approached the Architect to
retain it for the purposes of designing the building development
on the 36
Investigator Drive property.  It early became a two stage development for
budgetary reasons.  The total building development
was to consist of seven
industrial units.  They were partly for use by the Plaintiffs for a diesel
engine maintenance business and
partly for outright rental.  The Architect
accepted the retainer.  Further discussions took place in August, September and
November
1989.
<P>

10   	On 19 January 1990 the Architect, through Mr Rasa, a
principal of the Architect lodged a development application with the
Wollongong
City Council.  The development application, then to develop the property by
building seven units, was signed by Mr Rasa
and by the First Defendant.
Earlier on 1 January 1990, based on the recommendation of the Architect (Mr
Rasa to Mr Bailey) Sherson
&amp; Associates were instructed by the Architect to
design the structural engineering component for the overall design of the
project.
<P>

11   	The Architect's plans (DX2) were provided to the Engineer
by the Architect around mid-January.  By then the development was
to be staged,
as the Architect would have appreciated.  Thus that plan contains upon a
dimension line the words "stage 1", for the
first three units.   Further
drawing by the Architect (DX3) similarly identified "stage 1".  I am satisfied
that this in turn was
enough to put the Engineer on notice of the staged
construction, whether or not the engineers actually took that in at the time.
But in any event later site inspection on 10 December 1990 would have left the
Engineer in no doubt;  see paras 16 and 17 below.
<P>

12   	On 2 April 1990 the development application was granted.
Between 19  January 1990 and 2 April 1990 there were various communications
in
respect of the development works between the Architect and the Engineer.
<P>

13   	On 23 May 1990 the Architect applied for building
approval.  The approval was granted on 25 October 1990 as an approval for
a
seven unit development though some of the drawings submitted showed a stage 1,
for units 1, 2 and 3.
<P>

14   	The builder, Kenna &amp; Brown Pty Limited entered into a
written building agreement with the First Plaintiff.  The agreement
was
executed on 6 November 1990 for work specifically on "stage 1" of the project
and was for a twenty week building period.  On
15 February 1991, Wollongong
City Council sent a letter to the First Plaintiff confirming that the
construction was to be for "stage
1" only, being three units.  (The Plaintiffs
for financial reasons did not want to proceed with both stages at that time but
still
wanted the necessary approvals.)
<P>

15   	The construction works commenced in late 1990 and were
completed after the expiry of the 20 week building period prescribed
in the
building agreement at a time towards the end of 1991.  The western wall, being
the wall that later collapsed, was designed
and built as an internal wall
notwithstanding the fact that it had to function as an external wall during
such time as the second
stage of the building project remained incomplete.  The
second stage was not embarked upon.  It is not seriously disputed that had
units 4 to 7 been erected at the same time, there would have been additional
lateral stability provided for by the brick walls of
those other units. In
addition the roof bracing as a whole would have been far more adequate than the
roof bracing as it was for
just three units.
<P>

16   	During the term of the construction the Engineer visited
the site on at least two occasions.  The purpose of the first visit,
on or
shortly after 10 December 1990, was to inspect the preparation of the footings
and to certify the adequacy of preparation.
 The footings at that stage had
only been prepared for the first three units.  It was conceded by the
Engineer's counsel (T, 9(5))
that the Engineer actually asked the concreter on
site "where are the rest" -- meaning the other four units.  The second visit,
to
inspect the sewer line, was completed and confirmed by letter from the
Engineer to Kenna &amp; Brown Pty Limited dated 1 July 1991.
<P>

17   	The Engineer, if not earlier then as a result of the site
visits, can, I am satisfied, be taken to have become aware that
the planned
construction was not to be completed to the seven unit stage but only to the
three unit stage in the first instance.
 Thus on 22 August 1991 the Engineer
composed a letter to Kenna &amp; Brown Pty Limited.  That letter outlines the
building faults
evident in the construction to that date.  Relevantly, the
letter refers to the existence of only three units.  I conclude that the
Engineer was aware certainly as of 22 August 1991 and I am satisfied earlier,
during the engineering design phase, that only three
of the seven units had
been constructed.
<P>

18   	Towards the end of 1991 the First Plaintiff became
concerned as to the adequacy of the elements used to fix the roof supports
in
place.  The Engineer assured the First Plaintiff of the adequacy of roof
support in a letter of 27 September 1991 (PX1, 52). However,
the First
Plaintiff made further inquiries about the roof supports from Lysaght Building
Industries, the firm that manufactured the
metal components for the roof.
Lysaghts reported that "[a]dditional bolts are required at the lap as detailed
in [an accompanying
drawing].  Attention drawn to lack of fly bracing" (PX1,
36).  The results of that inquiry were communicated by the First Plaintiff
to
the Engineer.  The Engineer assured the First Plaintiff that the roof was
satisfactory.
<P>

19   	Early in 1992 a dispute arose between the First Plaintiff
and the builder Kenna &amp; Brown Pty Limited with respect to certain
aspects
of the building work.  In the course of that dispute the First Plaintiff
engaged solicitors Peedon, Brodie.  The matter went
to the Campbelltown Local
Court on 5 March 1992 but was ultimately resolved through mediation in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cjca1983302/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cjca1983302/" class="autolink_findacts">Community Justice Centres Act</i> 1983</a> (NSW)
on 6 April 1993. 
<P>

20   	During that dispute, the First Plaintiff obtained a
building consultancy report from Stephen Maber of Building Consultancy
Service.
The report (PX1, 65) is dated 9 May 1992.  It therefore came into existence
twelve days earlier than 21 May 1992, the latter
being six years from the date
(21 May 1998) when the Plaintiffs' present actions were brought.  It came to
the attention of Mr Bailey
"on about 9 May 1992" (T,41(57) to 42(5)).  The
evidence as to this needs to be more closely considered to determine at what
point
if at all his awareness centred on the fatal deficiency in the wall, or
should have done, taking reasonable steps.  This is because
of the implications
of the six year limitation period as it bears upon any claim in negligence;
see paras 69 and following.
<P>

21   	Thus while Mr Bailey became aware "on about" 9 May 1992
that the wall had been erected as a temporary wall: T, 41(38), at
T, 52(1-6) he
agreed in cross-examination, that it was in "May `92" that "<i>After</i> you
read this report you <i>became</i> aware, didn't you, that there was something
wrong with the western wall". [emphasis added]  At T, 52(8-14) he agreed that
"in 1992"
he knew the western wall had been defectively designed in so far as
it was an internal wall being used as an external wall.  As to
anything being
defective, except for T, 52(8-14) the questioning did not go further than that
after he read the BCS report he "became
aware that there might be a problem
with the brick wall": T, 41(32).  Thus it can be seen that while he
acknowledges he had the report
on about 9 May 1992, imprecise cross-examination
left the time of his awareness of what was in the report to be inferred.  This
is
in circumstances where the onus must be on the defendant who invokes the
limitation defence;  see para 82 below.
<P>

22   	Mr Bailey had in that report two statements upon which the
Architect, in particular, relies.  The first concerns the roof
and the second
the brickwork of the wall in question:
<P>

"II. ROOF: -- the roof purlins appear to have excessive amounts of deflection.
The roof deflects 20mm under a minor impact load
of 100kg. With this in
consideration, the roof may not withstand the wind forces placed upon it in the
future.
<P>

The roof requires extra bracing and stiffening. The fixing of snap-in purlin
stiffeners, as specified by the manufacturers, should
be installed. This may
reduce the amount of deflection occurring.
<P>

It is recommended that a full report/investigation by a structural engineer be
undertaken for the roof."
<P>

X.  BRICKWORK: -- Brick wall at the end of the factory has been erected as a
temporary wall until the 2nd stage of the factory complex
has been
completed.
<P>

The wall is only 230mm thick and should be checked for stability by a
structural engineer."
<P>

23   	It will be appreciated that Mr Bailey is warned to consult
a structural engineer for the roof, as the roof "<i>may</i>" not withstand
future wind forces and that a wall erected "as a temporary wall" should be
<i>checked</i> for stability by a structural engineer" -- it is not stated that
the wall <i>is</i> unstable at that point. His concessions in cross-examination
as to what he knew in "May 1992" or "in 1992", quoted above, do not
establish
that he knew anything more, immediately <i>before</i> 21 May 1992, than was in
the BCS Report of 9 May 1992.  Nonetheless, I am satisfied that he did know at
that date what was in the
BCS report.  The BCS report stops short of saying
that the building suffered from defective design.
<P>

24   	In any event, Mr Bailey did check the position with a
structural engineer, doing so after 21 May 1992.  The wall was checked
by Mr
Aplin a structural engineer on behalf of KF Williams &amp; Associates Pty
Limited and the findings of that inspection were
contained in a report ("the
first Aplin report") dated 9 July 1992 (PX1, 74).  Quoting from that first
Aplin report of 9 July 1992
of which para 2 is principally relevant:  
<P>

"1.	After design check calculations of the Dead and Wind loads on the roof, the
Z20025 purlins are considered adequate for the spans
in question provided the
bridging is amended to ensure full lateral torsional restraint. (provision of
Hook-Lok Bridging). It must
be clarified, however that deflection is not
dependent upon the provision of bridging. Bridging is to prevent buckling of
the purlins
due to wind load which causes suction (uplift loading) on the
roof.
<P>

2.	The 230mm thick temporary brick wall at the western end of the factory does
not comply with the requirements of the brickwork
code in terms of lateral
stability and is also considered inadequate for the wind loads imposed on the
wall.
<P>

Engaged brick piers 590 x 230 should be provided at 5 metre cts. to ensure
stability of the wall. The tops of these piers are required
to be tied
laterally to the roof framework.
<P>

3.	The angle bracing in the plane of the roof, buttressing the top of the
engaged brick piers on the Southern wall have been attached
to the cross walls
in a dissatisfactory manner. Bolts have been placed through the brickwork only
and not fixed to the raking angles
as is common practice.
<P>

There is a possibility that with wind load on the bracing angles, the top
courses of brickwork may be dislodged."
<P>

25   	On 2 August 1992 a further building consultancy report
(from "Building Consulting Service") was received by the Plaintiffs
through
their solicitors (PX1, 77-80) still for the purpose of the litigation with the
builder.  The report itemised and as requested
priced the work recommended by
the structural engineer in addition to pricing other remedial construction
works.  The cost of all
of the works was $7,800.  Under the itemisation of that
amount, the reinforcement of the western wall was referred to specifically:
<P>

"Steel column to Western wall to reinforce the wall against strong winds and to
conform to building codes as per Eng. [sic.] details."
(PX1, 78)
<P>

26   	KF Williams &amp; Associates Pty Limited then sent a
further report, received by the Plaintiffs' solicitors for the Local
Court
matter on 4 December 1992.  The document, was prepared for the purposes of a
Scott schedule of remedial work to be carried
out by the builder and expanded
upon the structural deficiencies of the building's roof and of the bracing to
the southern wall (PX1,
96) from which I quote:
<P>

"7.	There is a requirement to maintain stability regardless of whether a brick
wall is constructed as an internal or external wall.
<P>

8.	Galvanised steel rod can comply as bridging, however, the way in which the
rod bridging was fitted to the purlins was a totally
inadequate method of
providing bridging to those purlins.  For rods acting in tension to be
effective in providing lateral/torsional
restraint to purlins, the rods are to
be continuous in the same plane, supporting the outer leg of the purlins.
<P>

9.	The additional angle brackets are to provide stability to the wall as at
Item No. 7.
<P>

10.	The intersection of the angle bracing in the plane the roof does not
coincide with the engaged brick piers on the southern wall
of the building.
The bracing is therefore considered inadequate in providing stability to the
southern wall.  With the provision
of RHS columns fastened to the existing wall
and restrained at the top by the existing angle bracing, the wall can be
stabilised
in a positive manner.
<P>

11.	The 24mm dla tension rods may well be, adequate.  The purlins, however, are
incapable of providing sufficient compression strutting
between the node points
of the bracing rods.  The roof sheeting is possibly relied upon therefore, to
carry the bracing forces."
<P>

27   	There was a further and final letter from the same
structural engineers to the Plaintiffs still in regard to the Local Court
proceedings dated 15 January 1993 (PX1, 97).  It contained the following
assessment, having first described the "rod bridging" to
the purlins as a
"totally inadequate method of providing bridging to those purlins":

"<b>2.	Brick Wall at Western End of Factory</b>.  This temporary brick wall

<P>

[emphasis added]
<P>

28   	I will return to the significance of these reports,
including in particular the last letter, when dealing with the Architect's
and
Engineer's defences.
<P>

29   	In June of 1993 preparation began on work for the second
stage of the industrial units.  On 25 June 1994, KF Williams &amp;
Associate
Pty Limited invoiced the Company for work undertaken in designing the footings
and floor slab for stage 2 of the project
(D2X14).
<P>

30   	On 6 November 1994 the western wall of the building, left
unrectified for over two years since its construction, collapsed
under the
force of high winds.  Evidence of wind speed indicates that the wind speed on
that day at the University of Wollongong
peaked at a westerly wind of 54 knots
(PX1, 122). 
<P>

<b>Arrangements with Architect</b>
<P>

31   	It is not in dispute that there existed at the material
times from late 1989, a contract for services between the First Plaintiff
and
the Architects.  It is the Plaintiffs' contention that the Engineer was then
contractually retained by the Architect pursuant
to contractual duties earlier
assumed by the Architect in agreement with the First Plaintiff for both design
and engineering.  That
last proposition is disputed by the Architect who
contends that there was a separate contract for engineering design between the
First Plaintiff and the Engineer, merely effected via the Architect. But as the
Plaintiffs now rely solely on tort, this has ceased
to be a live issue, save as
it may bear on the responsibilities assumed by the Architect for tort
purposes.
<P>

32   	Supporting the Architect's contention, the Engineer admits
that, in or about January 1990, it entered into an agreement with
<i>the
Architect </i>for the provision of certain engineering services [Engineer 3rd
Amended Defence para 5].  The letter of 19 January 1990 (PX1, 1) containing
an
approximate quote by the Engineer for engineering design services in regard to
the construction was addressed and directed to
the Architects and not to either
Plaintiff.  The letter did not refer to the Plaintiffs as the clients of the
Engineer.  
<P>

33   	The Architect also relied upon the plaintiffs' expert
engineer Mr Low agreeing in cross-examination that an engineer has certain
expertise in relation to the design of structural elements of a building that
an architect may not have (T, 127(15-25).  The engineer's
input is important
because his design goes to ensuring that the building stays up, which is the
most important part of the overall
design process (T, 127(25-32).  He agreed
that architects reasonably rely on the experience of engineers in preparing a
design that
is structurally sound (T, 127(30-45).  However while that goes to
what an architect may do, by in effect sub-contracting or delegating
the
engineering design elements to the professional most competent in that area, it
begs the question whether the architect still
retains ultimate responsibility
for an overall building design service which includes the engineering design
elements of the structure,
albeit co-opting the assistance of a qualified
engineer in that task.
<P>

34   	Relevantly the quoted amount was then contained in a
letter from the Architects to the Company dated 31 January 1990 as part
of a
"Total fee" expressed in the singular (PX1, 3).  This gives some support to the
Plaintiffs' contention that this total fee was
for the Architect
<i>inclusive</i> of those engineering services.  The letterhead printed on that
document describes the Architect as "design &amp; <i>building</i> consultants"
(PX1, 3).  That suggests that the Architect held itself out as having
competence in building and not merely architectural
design, thus impliedly
embracing those engineering aspects inherent in a building consulting
service.
<P>

35   	Mr Rasa from the Architects furthermore conceded that its
architectural business was one where the architect provided "a full
service by
way of complete design" (Rasa cross-examination T, 168(15)). Mr Rasa's later
asserted that <i>in this instance</i> the Architect's retainer was to provide
only partial service (T, 168(22)).  That partial design service though was
concededly only
<i>part</i> of the overall service required by the Plaintiffs
(Rasa cross-examination T, 168(22)).  The Architects rely on having requested
that
the Company pay the Engineer's fee directly to the Engineer (Rasa
cross-examination T, 168(30) and affidavit of Mr Bailey of 4 August
1998, para
11).  That still leaves the question whether this was for convenience or rather
reflected a direct contractual relationship
between owner and engineer
bespeaking responsibility directly to the owner.
<P>

36   	The Architect likewise relied on the fact that the
"Memorandum of Fees" of the Engineers dated 16 July 1990 was addressed
to
"Baileys Diesel Service" (PX1, 10).  Further correspondence was also carried
out directly between the Plaintiffs and the Engineer
including, for example, a
letter from the Engineer of 9 August 1991 (PX1, 44) outlining some of the
construction faults present in
the building.  
<P>

37   	The Architect seeks to emphasise that the First Plaintiff
continually contacted the Engineer directly after the Architect's
role in
preparation of the drawings had concluded.  The Architect also contends that
the Engineer's visits on site were outside the
scope of the architect's
retainer, occurred well after that retainer had concluded, and were the subject
of a separate contract between
Bailey and the Engineer, without notification to
the architect.  
<P>

38   	I weigh this evidence, with other relevant matters, in
answering the first of the Legal Questions below.
<P>

<b>LEGAL QUESTIONS</b>
<P>

39   	Against that factual background and broad statement of the
contentions of the parties, I turn now to the relevant legal questions
and the
issues they pose. In answering these legal questions I will deal more closely
with the evidence given by the parties including
the expert evidence.
<P>

40   	The legal questions can be distilled in the following
formulation:  
<P>

<b>Question 1</b>
<P>

<b>Liability: </b> Is either the Architect or the Engineer or both, liable to
the Plaintiffs in negligence by failing, as particularised in the pleadings,
to
design the building so that it was, upon erection, structurally strong, stable
and sound in all respects? In particular as to
the Architect:
<P>

(a)	Did the Architect undertake to the Plaintiffs services which included
engineering design, or otherwise fail in its procurement
and supervisory role
so as to bear shared responsibility for the collapse with the Engineer, and
<P>

(b)	Is the claim in negligence stature-barred?
<P>

<b>Question 2</b>
<P>

<b>Defences and Damage:  </b>Depending on the answer to Question 1, as to
Architect and Engineer:
<P>

(a)	did the Plaintiffs in the circumstances fail to act reasonably in the
protection of their interest in the property between May
1992 and the collapse
of the building on 6 November 1994: 
<P>

(i)	by omitting to rectify the defects detected and reported first by Building
Consulting Service and then subsequently by Mr Aplin
of K F Williams and
Associates Pty Limited by implementing Mr Aplin's recommendations or, if that
would have been insufficient to
avert collapse, 
<P>

(ii)	by omitting to commission a professional and complying re-design and
associated upgrading of the building?
<P>

(b)	if so, does such failure and omission give rise to:
<P>

(i)	a defence based on <i>novus actus interveniens</i> interrupting causation
or rendering the damage not a foreseeable consequence of any negligence,
<P>

(ii)	a defence based on aggravation of damage, or
<P>

(iii)	contributory negligence, and if so how apportioned, or
<P>

(iv)	a failure to mitigate loss?
<P>

41   	As earlier noted, there is no question to be decided of
voluntary assumption of risk nor of contract.  If I were to find liability,
damage has been quantified and there is no question to be decided of the extent
of the contribution as between Architect and Engineer;
that last has also been
agreed.  However, in the latter event, there would remain a question of
contribution as between Plaintiffs
on the one hand and Architect and Engineer
on the other were contributory negligence established.
<P>

42   	Finally, although I have determined that the Engineer
should not be permitted at this late stage to re-open its case by introducing
a
defence that any claim of negligence is statute-barred, I have also dealt with
that defence so far as the Engineer is concerned
in case I were wrong in
denying that dispensation.  The Engineer did not seek to rely on any additional
evidence than was before
me. 
<P>

<b>The Architect alone</b>
<P>

43   	I turn now to answering the questions earlier posed,
starting with the issues applicable to the Architect alone.
<P>

44   	While the contractual claim is no longer pressed against
the Architect, a tortious claim in negligence against the Architect
does pose
an analogous question. Did the Architect owe a duty of care to the Plaintiffs
to exercise reasonable care and skill
<P>

(a)	in those elements of the design of the building that bore upon whether it
would, "upon erection, be structurally strong, stable
and sound in all
respects", or
<P>

(b)	as regards supervision of the building design and its construction overall
including procurement of engineering services and
relevant communication with
the Engineer?
<P>

Given their particular expertise, architects do not undertake a duty of care to
the client which extends to an assumed responsibility
for specialised aspects
of engineering design in the absence of an express undertaking to that effect
or which can be properly implied
from the circumstances, including the nature
of the retainer and any holding out.  An analogy can be found in a solicitor's
duty
of care which would not ordinarily extend to undertaking responsibility
for commercial as distinct from legal advice.  Thus in <i>Teachers Health
Investments Pty Limited v Wynne</i> (1996) NSW Conv Rep 55-785 Beazley JA said:
"It is well established that it is no part of a solicitor's function to give
commercial
or financial advice..." but added the important caveat, relevant
here, "unless retained to do so".  
<P>

45   	Thus the scope of the Architect's duty of care here
depends upon the responsibility assumed by the Architect for services
undertaken to the Plaintiffs having regard to the nature of its retainer.
However, just as, for example, an agent solicitor's duty
is not confined to
doing what it was retained to do as agent solicitor (or what it was
specifically asked to do by the principal
solicitor) so there is a duty owed to
the client to exercise reasonable care and skill <i>in course of</i> its
retainer to take all <i>reasonable</i> steps to avoid any real and foreseeable
risk of economic loss to the client;  <i>Westward Clothing Co Pty Ltd v
Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/1999/266.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] VSC 266 (Smith</a> J, 30 July 1999,
unreported).  The question is whether that proposition similarly applies here.
The Plaintiffs have the onus of establishing
that the Architect did in fact
assume responsibility for procuring and for supervising engineering design as
it affected structural
adequacy, including relevant communication with the
Engineer as well as overall supervision of the construction.  In the present
case the Plaintiffs contend that required the Architects at least to ensure, by
a proper system of communication between Architect
and Engineer, that the
western wall be not built or left as an internal wall lacking sufficient
structural stability.  If indeed
the Architect did undertake those functions,
then insofar as the Architect failed in carrying them out, that must according
to the
Plaintiffs give rise to liability in negligence, subject to any
defences, for what was a foreseeable risk of damage to the Plaintiffs;
 they
were clients known by the Architect to be relying upon the Architect for the
carrying out of that assumed responsibility and
vulnerable in the event of
failure to do so.  Such a duty of care is capable of arising incrementally to
the conventional advisory
relationship of architect and client, as its salient
features are not of themselves such as to preclude a duty of care of that
scope;
 I here adopt the High Court's treatment of duty of care and its scope
in <i>Perre v Apand Pty Ltd</i> ([1999] HCA 36, 12 August 1998, unreported) per
Gleeson CJ, paras 8 to 14 concurring in the judgment of Gummow J especially at
paras
297 to 302.   It remains to determine whether the Plaintiffs have
satisfied the onus of establishing a duty of care so extending
not merely for
ordinary architectural design, but embracing additional responsibility for
procuring and supervising engineering design,
including communication with the
Engineer.
<P>

46   	The Architect contended that the arrangements between it
and the First Plaintiff, Mr Bailey, and in turn between it and the
Engineers
were such that no such duty of care was owed, certainly in this extended form.
This was on the basis that the Architect,
as was customary and as understood by
the Plaintiffs, was in turn relying upon the expertise of the Engineer as
regards design of
the structural elements of the building and assumed no
responsibility for that itself.  That is disputed by the Plaintiffs.  The
Architect relied on Mr Low, the Plaintiff's expert engineer, who accepted that
an engineer has certain expertise in relation to the
design of structural
elements of the building that an Architect may not have (T, 127(15-25)). Thus
he acknowledged that the Engineer's
input is important because his or her
structural design goes to ensuring that the building stays up, which is a most
important part
of the overall design process (T, 127(25-32)). 
<P>

47   	Mr Low acknowledged that architects do reasonably rely on
the experience of engineers in preparing a design that is structurally
sound
(T, 127(30-45)).
<P>

48   	Mr Rasa from the Architect gave evidence that in a project
of this nature (with no internal supporting columns), the brickwork
was the
load-bearing component of the building. As such the brickwork forms the
structural component of the building and, as he saw
it, it is up to the
engineer to document it in the way that he sees fit (T, 170(25)). 
<P>

49   	The western wall was a structural wall. Being a structural
wall, according to Mr Rasa's evidence, the architect "cannot demonstrate
bracing or what needs to be done to keep that wall structurally sound". That he
said was the engineer's job "because the load-bearing
brickwork is the major
structural component of the building" (T, 170(32-35)).
<P>

50   	The Architect's case was that even though Mr Rasa admitted
that it would have been very simple for an architect to have placed
on his
drawings a notation of "insufficient strength for this external wall", it was
not proper to do that in this case because the
walls were a structural element
and therefore anything of this nature had to be done by the engineer. The
Architect's case was that
the architect could not comment on structural
matters, nor could they make notes of an engineering or structural nature,
because
they are not structural engineers (T, 177(5-20)).
<P>

51   	The uncontradicted evidence of Mr Rasa was that the
Development Application drawings were sent to the Engineer, being the
drawings
contained in DX2. These drawings contained a notation of "stage 1".  I am
satisfied that should have sufficiently alerted
the Engineer that this was a
staged development. The Engineer was never called to refute Mr Rasa's evidence
that those drawings were
so sent.  Indeed the Engineer gave no evidence, so
that it was not in contest that I should infer that any such evidence would not
have assisted the Engineer's case.
<P>

52   	In response to any contention that the Architect had
insufficiently advised the Engineer that the development was to be staged,
the
Architect noted that under cross-examination Mr Low confirmed that the most
important thing that the Architect had to do was
to advise the Engineer that
there was to be a staged development (T, 126(50)). Mr Low agreed that one way
to do this was to note
it on a plan provided by the Architect to the Engineer
(T, 127(1)). Upon being shown DX2, that is to say the plan represented by
it,
Mr Low acknowledged that the staged development was noted on the plan and that
the Engineer should have been aware from that
plan that the development was
staged.  If that were all there was to it, that could be accepted as being
sufficient to alert the
engineer to the need to do the engineering design
accordingly.
<P>

53   	However, the Plaintiffs put their case against the
Architect on a different basis. Essentially it is that the Architect was,
or
ought to have been aware, that when the Engineer's designs were received back
by the Architect from the Engineer, it should have
been apparent to the
Architect that the Engineer had not designed for a staged construction, though
the Architect had referred to
"stage 1" in the plans initially sent to the
Engineer. The Plaintiffs contend that the Architect's failure to identify and
communicate
that error to the Engineer was critical and was due to a lack of a
basic system of communication, in the absence of which the Architect
could not
safely proceed.  That in turn breached the Architect's responsibility though it
was not to be expected that he would carry
out the structural design
himself.
<P>

54   	The Plaintiffs' case is that the Architect held himself
out as offering a full design service which must at least extend to
responsibility for failing to identify to the Engineer that the Engineer had in
turn failed to do the necessary design for structural
strengthening of the
western wall.  At that minimum level of responsibility, the Architect was not
asked or required to specify the
particular structural design steps that should
be taken but simply to point out that none had been specified by the Engineer
to whom
the Architect had passed on the task.
<P>

55   	Mr Rasa gave evidence that he received the engineering
design drawings between April to July 1990. At T, 168(57)-169(6), Mr
Rasa was
not prepared to deny that, when he received the Engineer's drawing on the first
occasion, he was "then aware .... that the
Engineer was not designing for a
staged construction".  He said, it was "hard to recall" and that he was not
aware what conversations
there had been between others in his office and Mr
Sherson, the Engineer (T, 171(14-40)). As to his recollection as to "what was
being documented" he said, ".... in honesty I can't recall" (T, 169.42).
<P>

56   	He agreed, as to the Engineer's drawings, "all drawings
show that [western wall] as an internal wall" (T,170(1)), and "it
was on our
drawings as an internal wall" (T, 170(6)).
<P>

57   	Finally at T, 170(16) he had to concede: "when you got his
drawings in 1990 you knew that he had designed the wall ... as
an internal
wall? -- Yes".
<P>

58   	The cross-examination proceeded as follows (T,
170(21-35)):
<P>

"Q.	By that knowledge you knew that he had not designed that wall for a staged
construction, that's correct, isn't it?
<P>

A.	That is not quite correct because in a project of this nature the brickwork
was the load bearing component of the building. 
As such when the brickwork
forms the major structural component of the building, it's up to the engineer
to document it in the way
he sees fit.  Now he documented it as stage 2 being
carried on fairly shortly afterwards, I would have assumed then that something
were to be done about that wall.  He would have designed something with that
wall to make sure it is okay before stage 2 went ahead
because being a
structural wall we can't designate bracing, or what needs to be done, to keep
that wall structural sound.  That is
his job because the load bearing brickwork
is the major structural component of the building."
<P>

59   	Essentially, what Mr Rasa acknowledges about the drawings
he received from the Engineer is this:
<P>

(a)	he knew that a staged construction was to take place,
<P>

(b)	that the western wall was nonetheless designed as an internal wall.
<P>

Yet he asserts:
<P>

(a)	the Engineer could be relied upon to design something in time to make sure
that the wall so shown as an internal wall "is OK
before stage 2 went ahead",
and
<P>

(b)	this was never for the Architect to be concerned about because "being a
structural wall we can't designate bracing, or what
needs to be done to keep
that wall structurally sound" and this was "his job because the load-bearing
brickwork is the major structural
component of the building".
<P>

60   	Mr Rasa's evidence continued that he agreed that it was
important that the engineer be aware that the construction was to
be staged (T,
170(44)) and that the engineering drawings did not have "stage 1" on them (T,
170.21) and that he was not able to refer
to any communication from the
Engineer to show that the Engineer understood that this was to be a staged
construction (T, 171(33-57)).
At T, 170(33) Mr Rasa conceded that when he
received the drawings back from the Engineer "there was nothing, not one thing
on those
drawings to indicate that the Engineer's understanding equated to
your's?".
<P>

61   	At T, 173(29-38) Mr Rasa agreed that for the wall to stand
as an external wall for twenty weeks would be a "usual" construction
period for
the second stage, even if it had commenced straight away. He agreed that there
was no indication on the architectural
drawings which would alert the builder
to the fact that the western wall was not designed as an external wall,
asserting that it
would be "obvious" to the builder (T, 173(55)-174(7)).  By
that logic, the Architect could not deny that this critical deficiency
must
have been at least as obvious to himself as architect.
<P>

62   	Thus the Architect and the Plaintiffs join issue on Mr
Rasa's view that what occurs in the normal course of a construction
was that
even if an engineer does not show the bracings necessary on the drawings, the
normal state of affairs on the construction
site is that the matter will be
raised once the engineer is on site and the builder is on site. At the end of
stage 1, so the Architect's
evidence went, they (the engineer and builder)
would decide whether the wall needed to be braced (T, 170(50)) without
involving the
architect in any way. Mr Rasa relies for support on documents
relating to the Wollongong City Council which had the drawings showing
"stage
1" and where the building inspector confirmed: "Council recognised that the
building was only partially complete and assumed
that any required
modifications to the structure would have been made by the engineer and/or
builder" (PX1, 117).  However, Council's
expectation is not relevant to
determining the Plaintiffs' reasonable expectation of the Architect or the
Architect's responsibility.
<P>

63   	The First Defendant pointed out that there was no expert
evidence from any architect to suggest that Mr Rasa's conduct as
an architect
was negligent, that evidence coming instead from the Engineer, Mr Low, at T,
128(5)-129(5). Mr Low initially conceded
that it was reasonable for an
architect to assume that if an engineer had been informed of the development
was to be staged, then
that engineer would have taken into account whether
anything extra needed to be done to the western wall during stage 1 of the
development.
However, importantly, after initially assenting to the above
proposition, Mr Low qualified that answer in the following passage (T,
128(6)-129(5)), in my judgment correctly: 
<P>

"Q.	It would be reasonable for an architect to assume that if the engineer had
been informed that the development was to be staged
then he would have taken
into account whether or not anything extra needed to be done to the western
wall during the stage 1 of the
development? .... 
<P>

A.	conditional answer to that, the initial answer is yes, however, I think it
would be incumbent upon the architect to perhaps satisfy
himself that that had
been done when he received the engineer's drawings."
<P>

64   	Significantly, Mr Low also gave evidence to the effect
that not many builders would be so experienced as to be in a position
to have
"a fairly good idea as to whether or not a wall might require bracing during a
certain period" (T, 129(10-27)).
<P>

65   	Summing up, the Architect knew that the construction was
to be staged, knew that the western wall was nonetheless designed
by the
Engineer as an interior wall, can be taken to be aware that the builder was not
informed of the latter being an interior wall
or had taken no action to remedy
matters, yet the Architect took no steps:
<P>

(i)	to ensure that the Engineer properly understood the Architect's
instructions when on notice, actual or at least constructive,
that the Engineer
had failed to understand the Architect's instructions as evidenced by the fact
that the wall was shown as an interior
wall and had no designated strengthening
in the plans and, 
<P>

(b)	the builder was likewise not informed by the Architect that the western
wall should not be left as an internal wall.
<P>

66   	The Architect was not entitled to assume that adequate
"temporary bracing" would occur without following that up with the
Engineer. It
is true that the Architect could not be expected to know whether the roof
bracing sufficed or might lose some of its
integrity if it stopped in the
centre of the building (T, 176(46)-176a(7)). But that of itself does not
exonerate the Architect from
its responsibility when on notice to see to it
that the Engineer did direct his mind to the consequence of the staged
construction
for the western wall.  I am satisfied that was a shared
responsibility with the Engineer.  As I have already noted, I do not have
to
make any apportionment of their respective contributions between the two, as
that has already been agreed by them. Lest it be
thought that this is to impose
an unreasonable burden on an architect lacking expertise in engineering
matters, the answer is that
an architect with supervisory functions put on
notice of the engineer having misunderstood or overlooked a matter as obvious
as the
use of an internal wall where an external wall was required, cannot
eschew responsibility. Indeed, if the matter were as the Architect
said
"obvious" to the builder it should have been at least as obvious to the
Architect (see T, 173(55)-174(7)).
<P>

67   	There is nothing unfair, unjust or unreasonable as a
matter of policy in holding an architect liable for failure to discharge
what I
am satisfied was the responsibility it undertook.  That responsibility extended
to procuring the engineer's design and thus
required a proper system of
communication between architect and engineer.  Discharge of that responsibility
should have prompted
the Architect not only to observe that the western wall
was constructed merely as an internal wall without proper support as an
external
one, but to report that fact to the Engineer so the latter could
devise steps to bring about structural stability.  The Architect
clearly failed
to do so and nor did it take the matter up with the builder.  Remember too this
was an architect whose own letterhead
held the First Defendant out as "design
and building consultants" who, while claiming in this instance to provide only
a partial
service, acknowledged that the firm did provide "a full service by
way of complete design".  And in any event the shortcoming was
in procurement
and communication concerning an obvious error, not in engineering design
itself.  That conclusion does not depend
upon whether the Architect was at the
building in 1994, as Mr Bailey claims.  Mr Rasa does not recall being there,
but cannot guarantee
he was not, relying on reconstruction in support;  (T,
177(21)-178(5).
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

68   	The Architect breached its duty of care to the Plaintiffs
in its procurement and supervisory role in failing to take the necessary
steps
to ensure that the Engineer properly understood the Architect's instructions,
when it should have been apparent to the Architect
that they were not
understood and thus the Architect failed in procuring adequate design of the
structural elements.  The Architect
also failed to ensure that the builder did
not leave the western wall as an insufficiently stabilised internal wall.  The
Architect
is therefore liable in negligence to the Plaintiffs, subject to the
defences and matters going to damages dealt with below. 
<P>

<b>Is the claim statute-barred against the Architect?</b>
<P>

69   	We are concerned with a tortious claim in negligence based
on economic loss caused by latent defects in a building.  That
is to be
distinguished from cases of physical injury to person or property and from
present economic loss directly sustained.  We
are here considering
consequential damages flowing from a latent defect; see Deane J in <i>Hawkins v
Clayton</i> (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 587-8 with Mason and Wilson JJ concurring on
that aspect at 543, followed by the Appeal Division of the Victorian
Supreme
Court in <i>Pullen &amp; Anor v Gutteridge, Haskins &amp; Davey Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1993/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] VicRp 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20VR%2027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 VR 27.</a> The latter case affirmed that in cases of pure economic loss
due to a latent defect, time begins to run when the latent defect first
becomes
known or manifest. That principle was clearly assumed in <i>Bryan v Maloney</i>
(1995) 182 CLR 609 by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ at 627.
<P>

70   	This approach modifies the harshness of the so-called
Pirelli Rule applicable in the UK; (<i>Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar
Faber &amp; Partners</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 AC 1).</a>  Under that rule, where a building is
built so defectively as to be doomed from the start, the cause of action is
taken to have accrued
as soon as it was built, notwithstanding that the defect
may be a latent one not yet known or manifest or discoverable by reasonable
diligence on the part of the owner.
<P>

71   	The way in which that harshness has been alleviated is to
be found in the analysis of when consequential economic loss first
accrues.
Where latent building defects later cause consequential damage to the
structure, economic loss does not accrue until the
defect is discovered or
visible consequential damage occurs.  Until then the owner can honestly sell
the house for its market value
and if the owner did, would suffer no loss; see
<i>Pullen &amp; Anor</i> (supra) at 68-9 followed by Handley JA in <i>Sheldon v
McBeath</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) Aust Torts Reports  81-208</a> CA(NSW) at 62,081.
<P>

72   	Finally, as was said by the Full Federal Court in
<i>Jobbins v Capel Court Corporation Ltd &amp; Or</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/538.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 538</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2025%20FCR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 25 FCR 226</a> at 228
in a passage later approved in <i>Magman International Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v
Westpac Banking Corporation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2032%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 32 FCR 1</a> at 11:
<P>

"...where the incurring of damage is an essential element of a cause of action,
the suffering of some damage (the other elements
of the cause of action having
already occurred) will, in general, start time running, even although the
damage continues to grow.
 The running of time is not suspended until all the
damage which will be suffered has ceased to flow, nor does further damage
constitute
a fresh cause of action."
<P>

73   	However, there are two qualifications to be considered in
the present context.  First, damage so suffered must be real rather
than
nominal -- what has been described in the context of personal injury diseases
of gradual onset as "beyond what can be regarded
as negligible" or "not being
insignificant"; see <i>Cartledge v Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20AC%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] AC 758</a> in
the context of personal injuries and more generally Professor Stapleton, "The
Gist of Negligence: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cjca1983302/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a>; Minimum Actionable Damage"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20104%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 104 LQR 213.</a>
There is no reason for not importing that qualification on the stringency of
the rule for when time starts to run in personal injury
to economic loss as
well.
<P>

74   	Second, a plaintiff can recover compensation only for
<i>actual</i> loss or damage, as distinct from potential or likely damage.
Thus where, for example, a plaintiff enters into an agreement which
proves to
be disadvantageous, induced by misleading or deceptive conduct, although
detriment, in a contingent sense, is suffered
on entering into the agreement,
no actionable damage is suffered until the loss becomes actual rather than
prospective -- in the
case in question through fulfilment of a contingency; see
<i>Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514.</a>
<P>

75   	The Architect in its limitation defence relies on the
proposition that a cause of action for tortious negligence is complete
and time
starts to run as soon as some damage has occurred, and this even if the
plaintiff is not aware of the damage; see <i>Sheldon v McBeath</i> (supra)  per
Handley JA at 62,081. However, that principle must be read in conjunction with
the earlier principles to which I have
made reference, insofar as they explain
when, in the case of a latent defect giving rise to consequential
<i>economic</i> loss, the action is taken to be complete and time starts to
run.
<P>

76   	Here, the Architect claims that the Plaintiffs suffered
loss or damage more than six years before the commencement of the
proceedings.
That damage or loss was said to have been suffered by the Plaintiffs prior to
21 May 1992, being six years prior to
the filing of the summons.  It was said
to arise from the receipt of a defective engineering design, requiring further
payment for
the retention of a new engineer to redo the work, which the
Plaintiffs would have appreciated prior to 21 May 1992. The First Defendant
refers to Mr Bailey's evidence in relation to his prior knowledge of the
defective nature of the design work and the initial damage
that both he and his
company is said to have suffered, in these terms:
<P>

&#183;	"Bailey acknowledged that he received and read the BCS (Maber) report on
about 9 May 1992 (T, 2.5)
<P>

&#183;	At the time that he received the BCS report, Bailey believed that the
western wall had been <b>defectively designed</b> insofar as it was an internal
wall that was being used as an external wall (T, 52.10).
<P>

&#183;	The damage that was suffered was, at the very least, the cost of having
"...<i>to retain a new engineer who is completely redoing all the engineer's
work</i>." (Ex.PX1-p92)"
<P>

77   	The Architect then contends that although it may be argued
that there were two separate types of damage, namely the initial
damage caused
by the defective design requiring the re-doing of the engineering work, and the
later damage caused by the collapse,
such a distinction is of no consequence.
The Architect relies upon the principle that where subsequent injury (here the
collapse)
is consequential upon and governed by the same cause of action (here
the negligence) as the earlier damage (the need to rectify the
design of the
wall), time starts to run from the time the earlier damage is inflicted as
regards both the original injury and the
consequential injury; <i>Magman
International</i> (supra) per Beaumont J at 11, affirming <i>Jobins v Capel
Court Corporation Ltd</i> (supra).
<P>

78   	Thus the Architect contends that by mid-May 1992, the
Plaintiffs were aware of the defective design. At that stage the cause
of
action in tort was said to be complete as some damage, the need to re-do the
Engineer's work, had already occurred. The inadequacy
of the design (the
negligent act) was also known or manifest by mid-May 1992 so that, all of the
facts which were material to be
proved to entitle the Plaintiffs to succeed in
an action against the Architect were known by mid-May 1992.  I should at this
point
observe that there is no evidence as to the precise cost of new
engineering drawings, but it can reasonably be inferred as likely
to be
relatively modest, certainly compared to the agreed figure for damage
overall.
<P>

79   	The Plaintiffs respond by disputing that it has been
established by the Architect, who bears the onus of proof (see para 82),
that
Mr Bailey was relevantly aware of the latent defect concerning the western wall
prior to 21 May 1992, there having been no precise
cross examination of Mr
Bailey to fix the date of his actual awareness.
<P>

80   	It is convenient that I set out the relevant transcript
references as fairly summarised by the Plaintiffs in their written
submissions
dated 12 July 1999:
<P>

"Mr Bailey said that he received the BCS document "<i>on about</i>" 9 May 1992:
T, 41(57)-42(5).
<P>

"He became aware "on about" 9 May 1992 that the wall had been erected as a
temporary wall: T, 41(38). At T, 52(1-6) he agreed that
it was in "May `92"
that "<i>After</i> you read this report you <i>became</i> aware, didn't you,
that there was something wrong with the western wall".
<P>

At T, 52(8-14) he agreed that "in 1992" he knew the western wall had been
defectively designed in so far as it was an internal wall
being used as an
external wall.
<P>

As to anything being defective, except for T, 52(8-14) the questioning did not
go further than that after he read the BCS report
he "became aware that there
might be a problem with the brick wall": T, 41(32).
<P>

A re-reading of the Transcript page 41-50 reveals that the questioning as to
receipt of the BCS report and knowledge of defects
did not rise above the fact
that it contained a recommendation to have a structural engineer check it for
stability.  The only evidence
as to his appreciation, in May 1992, that there
was a <i>defective design</i> was at T, 51(1-14), which was left by the
cross-examiner as "<i>in 1992</i>" and "<i>in May 1992</i>".  There was no
attempt to clarify what was the date "<i>After you read the report</i>" nor
when he "became" aware, beyond "<i>May 1992</i>", and "<i>in 1992</i>" "
<P>

81   	I would conclude that it is more probable than not that Mr
Bailey received the BCS document prior to 21 May 1992 and thus
can be taken to
have been aware of its contents prior to that date also. The real question is
whether by virtue of that awareness
of the contents of the BCS document, Mr
Bailey thereby must be taken to have "discovered" the faults, such that the
latent defect
"first becomes known or manifest". <i>Pullen &amp; Anor v
Gutteridge, Haskins &amp; Davey Pty Ltd</i> at 66-7 and Deane J in <i>Hawkins v
Clayton</i> (supra) at 587-8. There Deane J speaks of when a defect is
"actually discovered or became manifest, in the sense of being discoverable
by
reasonable diligence, with the consequence that the damage was then sustained
by the then owner".  Thus in the case where there
is no actual discovery, but
the defect could be discoverable by reasonable diligence, the moment when it
becomes manifest needs to
allow for the time reasonable diligence would take to
ascertain the defect.  In other words, if the defect has already occurred,
but
reasonable diligence would take three weeks, then that time should be allowed
<i>before</i> the defect <i>could</i> have "became manifest".  This is unless
the first report was enough of itself for the defect to be actually discovered
by Mr Bailey,
a conclusion which I reject for reasons later elaborated.
<P>

82   	It is clear that the onus of establishing a defence under
the <i>Statute of Limitations</i> is upon the party invoking the statute,
however pleaded; see <i>Pullen &amp; Anor</i> at 71 to 77.
<P>

83   	A fair reading of the critical passages of the BCS Report
of 9 May 1992 is that the wall is described as a temporary wall
and the report
advises that it should be checked for stability by a structural engineer. There
is a similar reference to the roof
which it is said "may not withstand the wind
forces placed upon it in the future" and the recommendation is for a full
report/investigation
by a structural engineer.  I consider that the Report, by
itself, does not put the Plaintiff in the position, without more, that
the
defect is <i>actually</i> discovered;  the question is rather when it could
have become manifest, in the sense of becoming discoverable by reasonable
diligence.
<P>

84   	That, I am satisfied, required further reasonable enquiry
of a structural engineer to constitute what is necessary for the
exercise of
"reasonable diligence" in rendering the defect manifest.  I am further
satisfied on the evidence before me and recognising
the onus is on the
Defendant, that such an enquiry would reasonably take at least a month and thus
would have delayed discovery till
<i>after</i> 21 May 1992.  In the events that
happened, the further enquiry took place and <i>did</i> take around a month, as
demonstrated by the fact that the first Aplin report is dated 9 July 1992 --
and led to the further report
from BCS of 2 August 1992.  But I should
emphasise that in so concluding I am <i>not</i> at this point determining,
either as of 9 July 1999 or as of 2 August 1992, or indeed until the wall did
collapse, that:
<P>

(a)	the defect was earlier discovered, or
<P>

(b)	that the steps in fact taken by Mr Bailey rendered the defect manifest
earlier.
<P>

Those questions are dealt with later.  All I am determining is that the defect
was not discovered prior to 21 May 1992 and reasonable
steps would necessarily
delay discovery till <i>after</i> 21 May 1992, on any view.
<P>

85   	Accordingly, I conclude that the relevant defect did not
become known or manifest till <i>after</i> 21 May 1992 and thus the six year
limitation period had not expired, even if damage had been first sustained
before the wall's collapse.
 It is to that latter proposition I now turn.
<P>

86   	There is however a further basis for that conclusion
turning on <i>what</i> is to be discovered.  What is to be discovered is
whether and when "damage has been <i>sustained</i>", in the economic sense.
The word "defect" is clearly used by Deane J in <i>Hawkins v Clayton</i> in
that sense.  The fundamental point made by the Plaintiffs is that the design
defect in the present context gave rise to no damage
at the point of receipt of
the BCS report or indeed later reports.  Rather it gave rise to the potential
for future damage as occurred
when the wall eventually collapsed, this being a
potential that depended upon the fulfilment of a contingency of the kind
described
in <i>Wardley Australia Limited v Western Australia</i> (supra). The
contingency is the application of strong wind forces prior to completion of
stage 2 causing the destruction of the building.
 The Defendant contends in
response that there was damage that pre-dated the six year limitation period,
being the cost of getting
further engineering advice and drawings.  The
Architect relies upon the damage said to have already occurred by reasons of
the need
".... to retain a new engineer who is completely re-doing all the
Engineer's work". (PX1, 92 being a file note of a conference between
the First
Plaintiff and his solicitor).  But that is refuted by the following
circumstances:
<P>

(a)	That cost was never a specified part of the Plaintiffs' claim (see the
Plaintiffs' summons at C23 and the accompanying particulars),
and not
necessarily recoverable in any event for the reasons elaborated below,
<P>

(b)	That cost even if recoverable was distinct, in causal if not obligation
terms, from the actual claim resulting from collapse
of the building,
<P>

(c)	That cost even if recoverable would have been likely to be wholly
insignificant in amount, compared to the actual claim of $662,680.
<P>

(d)	The Defendant Architect, upon whom the onus rests, provided no evidence as
to the quantum of any damage nor were the Plaintiffs
cross-examined on that,
and
<P>

(e)	Any deficiency of design would not have been discovered just from the first
BCS Report but only after the further design work
was done by an engineer and
that, as I have earlier determined, would necessarily have been <i>after</i> 21
May 1992.
<P>

87   	The underpinning for these conclusions are fairly put in
the Plaintiffs' written submissions of 12 July 1999, quoted below:
<P>

"(i)	The design prepared for Mr Bailey was for construction in two stages;
<P>

(ii)	Mr Bailey intended to build the second stage when he could afford it;
<P>

(iii)	Had the whole project been erected, the subject western wall would have
been of sufficient strength as an internal wall, and
the roof bracing system as
a whole would have been adequate.  No one suggests that, upon completion of the
whole, the wall would
still have been at risk;
<P>

(iv)	The design defect here was the omission of further works, i.e. temporary
strengthening of the western wall and temporary stiffening
of the roof
bracing;
<P>

(v)	Had such temporary bracing and stiffening been carried out by the builder
(for example immediately at conclusion of the works
under the building
contract), the cost thereof would have been an additional cost to the owner --
but such additional cost was always
necessary.  It would have been incurred in
a proper design for two stage construction.  Such additional cost would not
have been
expenditure in the nature of damages;
<P>

(vi)	The only possible additional cost in the nature of damages may have been a
differential element, i.e. if the cost to do the
temporary bracing and
stiffening <i>after</i> conclusion of the building contract would have been
greater than had such works been done as part of the works under the building
contract. But there was no evidence about that;
<P>

(vii)	In <i>Sheldon v McBeath</i>, the footings were faulty as a result of
faulty workmanship and inadequate inspection by the architect. Here, the
western wall, and
roof bracing, were not in themselves faulty.  Here, the
design defect was failure to provide additional works in the nature of bracing
and stiffening;
<P>

(viii)	Here, monies paid away were not paid away for defective works;  not
enough money was spent."
<P>

88   	Another way of putting the Plaintiffs' argument is derived
from the following passage of Handley JA in <i>Sheldon v McBeath</i> at 62,081:

<P>

"These authorities establish that where latent building defects later cause
consequential damage to the structure economic loss
does not occur until the
defect is so discovered or visible consequential damage occurs. Until then the
owner can honestly sell the
house for its market value, and if he did would
suffer no loss. These cases also decide that the owners did not suffer economic
loss
when they acquired the houses without knowledge of the defective
foundations."
<P>

89   	In the present case the Defendants have not refuted that
the Second Plaintiff could sell the property with full disclosure
of the
internal wall and its requirement for additional expenditure and be paid its
market value, reflecting expenditure still to
be made for the temporary
strengthening of the western wall and temporary stiffening of the roof bracing,
or leaving it to the purchaser
to build stage 2 straight away taking the risk
of any wind damage during the construction period.
<P>

<b>Summing up</b>
<P>

90   	Any defect was not reasonably discoverable or discovered
before 21 May 1992 as evinced by the date of the second report. 
The Architect
has not refuted the proposition that this damage could have been avoided, as
would any rectification work, if stage
2 had been built straight away -- or
before the wall collapsed, such that the building could have been sold with
loss on that basis.
 Certainly, the Architect has not satisfied the onus to
demonstrate that the initial so-called damage was more than "what can be
regarded as negligible".  Finally, the relevant damage claimed here is, as the
Plaintiffs contend, economic loss for the collapse
of the building.  That
damage to be sustained depended upon the fulfilment of a contingency which only
occurred <i>during</i> the limitation period.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

91   	The First Defendant fails to discharge the onus upon it in
invoking the limitation period which therefore affords no defence.
 Although
not necessary to decide this, I would have reached the same conclusion in
relation to the Second Defendant, had the Second
Defendant been permitted to
invoke the limitation period, contrary to the conclusion I reached that it
should not.
<P>

<b>Negligence of Engineer</b>
<P>

92   	The Engineer concedes that it would be open to the Court
on the evidence, to find that the Engineer was negligent. The Engineer
likewise
concedes that Court could properly draw an inference, from the fact that the
Engineer did not lead evidence from Messrs
Sherson and Lautier of the Second
Defendant, that their evidence would not assist the Engineer's case; see
<i>Jones v Dunkel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298</a> per Windeyer J at 320-21. I have
already concluded that the Architect was negligent.
<P>

<b>DEFENCES AND DAMAGES</b>
<P>

<b>Causation -- Intervening Cause</b>
<P>

93   	The starting point in considering causation are the
findings so far reached as to <i>how</i> the collapse came about.  I find that:

<P>

(a)	the Plaintiffs relied on the Architect in the procurement of the necessary
engineering design and in particular relied on the
Architect as regards
supervision and communication with the Engineer as required, including ensuring
that the western wall was insufficiently
stabilised as an internal wall given
that it was required to perform as an external one, 
<P>

(b)	the Plaintiffs also relied on the Engineer to carry out the necessary
engineering decision to ensure such stability, and
<P>

(c)	the Architect failed properly to supervise and communicate to the Engineer
concerning the inadequately stabilised western wall
when he should have
appreciated that it was constructed as an internal wall but required to
function as an external one, while the
engineer failed to provide proper
engineering design to stabilise that wall in those circumstances.
<P>

94   	Analysis of causation has been the subject of much
judicial exegesis in recent times.  The now accepted formulation is to
be found
in <i>Bennett v Minister for Community Welfare</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176 CLR 408</a> in the
majority judgment of Mason CJ Deane and Toohey JJ at 412-3 emphasising that
causation is essentially a question of fact, to
be resolved as a matter of
common sense.  Once however what happened has been explained, what Lord Hoffman
emphasises about the attribution
of legal responsibility for those events
becomes the principal question.  Thus he said in <i>Environmental Agency
(formerly National River Authority) v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20WLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 WLR 350</a> (at 358):  "one cannot give a common sense answer for the
purpose of attributing responsibility under some rule without knowing the
purpose and scope of the rule" and that this is itself a question of law not
fact -- though it may be more accurate to describe it
as mixed fact and law.
He returns to that theme in a recent paper:  "The reason why courts get the
wrong answer on questions of causation
is not usually because they have
misunderstood the facts or lack common sense but because they have got the law
wrong"; "Common Sense
and Causing Loss", lecture to the Chancery Bar
Association, 15 June 1999.  Amplifying what the High Court said in
<i>Bennett</i> on causation:
<P>

`In the realm of negligence, causation is essentially a question of fact, to be
resolved as a matter of common sense.  In resolving
that question, the "but
for" test, applied as a negative criterion of causation, has an important role
to play but it is not a comprehensive
and exclusive test of causation;  value
judgments and policy considerations necessarily intrude.  The inadequacy of the
"but for"
test has emerged in cases in which a superseding cause, amounting to
a <i>novus actus interveniens</i>, has been held to break the chain of
causation which would have otherwise resulted from an earlier wrongful act or
omission.  In
those cases, though the earlier wrongful act or omission may have
amounted to an essential condition of the occurrence of the ultimate
harm, it
was not the true cause or a true cause of that harm.' [footnotes omitted]
<P>

95   	The cases themselves illustrate two things.  First that
application of those principles is no mechanical process devoid of
any policy
overlay, and second, that the process of decision making actually followed is
in practice a two stage process of enquiry.
 Professor Stapleton has recently
argued in a paper "Causation Revisited" that most disputes about causation are
ultimately not about
fact at all -- for the trial judge has usually explained
factually <i>how</i> the events occurred. Rather it is about competing
perspectives on agreed or found facts, in answering the question which of such
causal factors should "make a difference"; see "Perspectives on Causation",
from Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence (4th series) (OUP
1999 in press) by
Professor Stapleton.
<P>

96   	Drawing on Professor Stapleton's analysis, I would
describe the two stage process in these terms.
<P>

First, what were the factors, including those relating to the defendant, and
other external factors, which led to the event, or
transition, giving rise to
the damage claimed, being the "but for" factors, or those that would have been,
had not another set of
factors intervened.
<P>

This involves identifying all factors of at least material contribution to the
loss, then determining which if any were sufficient
in themselves to cause it
and which were at least concurrent causes of the "but for" kind or would have
been, but for other factors
present.  In that context, their chronology,
sequence, interaction in a chain of events and how far they were reasonably
foreseeable
are all part of that factual explanation.  That stage is linked to
the second stage of enquiry, concerning the attribution of legal
responsibility.  
<P>

The second stage of enquiry asks which factors <i>should</i> be treated as
"making a difference".  That entails assessing the defendant's conduct, whether
act or omission, not only in its factual
context but by reference to
considerations such as:
<P>

(i)	the scope of the duty of care earlier found in relation to the events
giving rise to the damage,
<P>

(ii)	the foreseeability of the damage so far as the defendant is concerned,
itself a factual question and a function of the degree
of likelihood of the
risk coming home;  for physical injury, still tilted as compared to economic
loss in favour of the claimant,
it suffices that injury of the same general
kind is foreseeable, as distinct from the injury that in fact occurred,
<P>

(iii)	in the case of negligence by omission, the hypothetical question of
whether performance of the duty would have averted the
damage or removed its
risk and if by commission, more generally whether the claimed damage would have
occurred without the defendant's
conduct, and
<P>

(iv)	the remoteness of the damage, which is not so much a matter of
spatio-temporal concerns though they may be involved, but where
in the chain of
consequences and degree of foreseeability the particular item of damage is to
be found and a line drawn;  whether,
as a matter of policy responsibility in a
legal sense <i>should</i> fall on the defendant.  Often the language of
proximate cause has been used, concealing something much more rough and ready,
where
"because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,
the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events
beyond a certain
point.  That is not logic.  It is practical politics"; <i>Palsgraf v Long
Island</i> <i>RR</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%20248%20NY%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 248 NY 339</a> at 352 (Andrews J). 
<P>

97   	In the case of an omission to perform a positive duty,
determining whether a <i>novus actus interveniens</i> is operative straddles
both stages of the enquiry.  It brings into play what Gaudron J described in
<i>Bennett v Minister for Community Welfare</i> (supra) at 420-1:
<P>

"And although it is sometimes necessary for a plaintiff to lead evidence as to
what would or would not have happened if a particular
common law duty had been
performed, generally speaking, if an injury occurs within an area of
foreseeable risk, then, in the absence
of evidence that the breach had no
effect, or that the injury would have occurred even if the duty had been
performed, it will be
taken that the breach of the common law duty caused or
materially contributed to the injury.  However, the question whether some
supervening event broke a chain of causation which began with or which relates
back to an omission or a failure to perform a positive
duty, is one that can
only be answered by having regard to what would or would not have happened if
the duty had been performed.
 It is only by undertaking that exercise that it
is possible to say whether the breach was `still operating', or, continued to
be
casually significant when the harm was suffered."  [footnotes omitted]
<P>

Her footnote 23, omitted from the above, suggests a shift in evidentiary onus
upon the defendant once an injury occurs within an
area of foreseeable risk.
<P>

98   	Professor Glanville Williams in his Joint Torts and
Contributory Negligence (1951) stated at para 2-24 that the <i>novus actus
interveniens</i> "must constitute an event of such impact that it rightly
obliterates the wrong-doing of the defendant", earlier stating:
<P>

"If a particular consequence of the defendant's wrongdoing is attributable to
some independent act or event which supersedes the
effect of the tortuous
conduct, the defendant's responsibilities may not extend to the consequences of
the supervening act or event."
<P>

99   	It will generally speaking, not be possible to establish a
<i>novus actus interveniens</i> unless:
<P>

(a)	the breach is shown to have had no causative effect, even of the "but for"
kind, because the injury would have occurred, or
the same risk of it, even if
the duty had been performed; compare <i>Chappel v Hart</i> (1998) 156 ALR 517;
72 ALJR 1344 (where the minority would have concluded that a surgeon's failure
to warn did not materially contribute
to the plaintiff's injury),
<P>

(b)	the intervening act or decision was not a reasonably foreseeable
consequence of the negligent act in the sense of being "in
the ordinary course
of things the very kind of thing likely to happen as a result of the
defendant's negligence" (per Mason CJ in
<i>March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 506</a> at 517-8),
<P>

(c)	there was no positive duty to take precautions against the happening of the
intervening act or that class of act;  contrast
the finding of the House of
Lords in <i>Reeves v Commissioner or Police of the Metropolis</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] UKHL 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%203%20WLR%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 3 WLR
363</a> that there was a positive duty of care to guard against that very act --
suicide by a prisoner -- so precluding any defence based
on <i>novus actus
interveniens</i> (or <i>volenti</i>) despite the autonomous nature of the
prisoner's decision.
<P>

100   	For the purpose of <i>novus actus interveniens</i> the
Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs' conduct was so unreasonable as to
displace any causative effect of the Defendants' own
acts or omissions.  Such
conduct by the Plaintiffs must thus be shown to have been so
<i>unreasonable</i> as to be a supervening cause of the loss;   see <i>McKew v
Holland &amp; Hannen &amp; Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/1970_SC_HL_20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] UKHL 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20SC%28HL%29%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) SC(HL) 20</a> at 25
per Lord Reid, approved in <i>Mahoney v J Krusich (Demolitions) Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 522</a> at 528.  I would agree that such conduct can be unreasonable
because of omission or failure to act in appropriate circumstances.
<P>

101   	In the context of aggravation of damage, the Plaintiff's
conduct is similarly assessed for unreasonableness by reference
to whether, as
in the refusal of potentially efficacious medical intervention, the Plaintiff's
omission to act, judged by reference
to the Defendants' duty of care and its
extent, makes the plaintiff the effective cause of his or her own injury.  Here
an evidentiary
onus to negate causation passes to the plaintiff, once the
defendant has done enough to raise the issue.  Thus Luntz "Assessment
of
Damages" 3rd edition (Butterworths, 1990) at 105:
<P>

"Cases where it is alleged that the plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable
care may in some instances be more categorised as concerned
with `aggravation'
rather than `mitigation' of damage (cf <i>Bell v Knight</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20St%20R%20Qd%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] St R Qd 234
(FC)</a>, where it was held that the trial judge might properly have reduced the
damages on account of evidence that the plaintiff's condition
was worse than it
would have been if he had not disregarded medical instructions after his
discharge from hospital).  The only consequence
of such categorisation may be
that the onus of proving the exercise of reasonable care would fall on the
plaintiff."
<P>

102   	In the case of mitigation of damage, the issue of the
plaintiff's reasonableness must turn on whether the plaintiff has failed,
<i>after</i> the loss, to take some precaution or step which was reasonable to
take in light of the defendant's wrong.  That cannot be made out
here.  This is
because the failures relied upon all preceded that loss, which only occurred
when the wall collapsed, even if it were
"an accident waiting to happen".
<P>

103   	Finally when it comes to contributory negligence, the
issue of plaintiff unreasonableness does arise <i>prior</i> to the defendant's
wrongful act, acts or omissions by the plaintiff.  That unreasonableness must
consist of a failure by the plaintiff
to take proper care for its own
protection, so that its fault is a legally contributory cause, together with
the defendant's default,
in bringing about the injury;  Fleming, the Law of
Torts (1992) at 242 citing the US Restatement.  That leads to the factual
question,
did the Plaintiffs between May 1992 and the building collapse on 6
November 1994 act so unreasonably as to negate causation, or aggravate
damage
or constitute contributory negligence?  I turn to that first.
<P>

<b>Reasonableness of Plaintiffs' Conduct</b>
<P>

104   	The Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs did so fail to
act reasonably, by failing to act upon the reports of Mr Aplin
and BCS or, to
the extent they were deficient or acting on them would have been inefficacious,
by failing to commission a professional
and complying re-design and associated
upgrading of the building.
<P>

105   	The starting point is the actions of Mr Bailey, who may
be taken to represent both himself and, as the directing mind of
the Second
Plaintiff company, that company. I am satisfied that there is no basis for
distinguishing the two.
<P>

106   	It is clear enough that Mr Bailey, and thus the
Plaintiff:
<P>

(i)	did commission a building consultancy report from Building Consultancy
Services dated 9 May 1992, doing so prompted by litigation
with the builder,
<P>

(ii)	did, as recommended by the BCS report consult a structural engineer,
namely Mr Aplin of K F Williams &amp; Associates Pty Limited
and thus were not
guilty of any failure in that regard.
<P>

(iii)	the Plaintiffs received three reports and a set of calculations and
drawings from K F Williams &amp; Associates Pty Limited,
namely a report of 9
July 1992 (PX1, 74), then a series of calculations and drawings of work to be
carried out dated August 1992
(D2X12 and D2X13), a document entitled
"Additional Comments to the Scott Schedule" dated 4 December 1992 (PX1, 95, 96)
and finally,
a structural report of 15 January 1993 (PX1, 97, 98).
<P>

(iv)	on 8 August 1992, using the plans and a quotation information sheet, BCS
costed the rectification work as proposed by Mr Aplin
at $7,800.
<P>

(v)	Mr Bailey did not implement the Aplin/BCS proposal and in particular stated
that he did not recognise that the building might
collapse, based on his
understanding of the Aplin report of 9 July 1992, and
<P>

(vi)	the Plaintiffs contend, based on the expert evidence analysed in more
detail below, that had the steps recommended by Mr Aplin
and costed by BCS been
implemented, it was more probable than not that the building would still have
collapsed under the wind conditions
experienced, so that it was not
unreasonable for the Plaintiffs to have failed to implement the BCS/Aplin
proposal, whatever their
reasons;  the Defendants dispute that conclusion, but
in any event contend that even if correct, it does not bear upon the
reasonableness
or otherwise of the Plaintiffs' conduct, in the
circumstances.
<P>

107   	Turning first to the Plaintiffs' reasons, Mr Bailey's
evidence was that he did not recognise that the Aplin report of 9 July
1992
(PX1, 74) indicated that the condition of the building was dangerous, and that
it could collapse. It will be recalled that that
report did not say that the
building would collapse though the Defendants contend that was clearly enough
indicated by what <i>was</i> said.  What was said was that "the 230mm thick
temporary wall at the western end of the factory does not comply with the
requirements
of the brickwork code in terms of lateral stability and is also
considered inadequate for the wind loads imposed on the wall".  There
follows a
recommendation for engaged brick piers at intervals to ensure stability of the
wall, to be tied laterally to the rear framework,
a recommendation which the
Plaintiffs' experts say would not have been effective.
<P>

108   	Mr Aplin was cross-examined on his report and it is clear
that Mr Aplin was of the opinion that the building was in dangerous
condition
and at risk of collapse, but deliberately chose not to state such opinion in
those terms in his report. He was cross-examined
about this (T, 190, 191) where
the following revealing exchange occurred during cross-examination:
<P>

"Q.	You did not use the word `collapse'?
<P>

A.	No, I did not.
<P>

Q.	Is that because you had not, at the time, formed the view that it was in
danger of collapse?
<P>

A.	No.  What I write in the report, and what I actually think are actually two
different things, because it is not for me to look
at someone else's design and
say that that is going to collapse.  All I can do is, upon my structural
thinking and structural analysis,
in conjunction with the code and the
requirements for stability, I can only use those but I can't -- it is not for
me to make the
judgment specifically as to whether that structure is going to
collapse or not;  I may have the thinking, and <i>I probably certainly did have
the thinking that the structure would collapse, but I was not going to say that
in a report</i>.
<P>

Q.	Equally, you weren't going to say in the report on the same basis that it
was in a dangerous condition?
<P>

A.	That would be correct.
<P>

Q.	For the reasons you have just explained?
<P>

A.	Exactly."
<P>

[emphasis added]
<P>

109   	Mr Bailey's evidence as to his understanding of the
problem is fairly summarised by the Plaintiffs as follows:
<P>

"(a)	He did not think the building might collapse.  "<i>There is no mention of
that anywhere</i>". T, 46(24).
<P>

He did not believe that there were any safety implications because "...<i>I
would have thought that he [Mr. Aplin] would have told me first off because it
is very concerning</i>"; T, 46(53).
<P>

(b)	"<i>If I was told that the wall would fall down or was in danger of falling
down, I would have done something about it straight away.
 I would have called
in another engineer to do an assessment on it and, with that, I would have
fixed it</i>.": T, 48(26).
<P>

(c)	As to his understanding of lateral stability, he believed that the
expression meant that the building could move, and that "<i>maybe we would get
cracks in the wall ... probably for one or two years</i>."; T, 45.
<P>

"<i>My interpretation of stability is the wall moving, not falling down or in
danger of falling down ... that the wall would move, it
would create cracks
visible by me</i>.": T, 49(26).
<P>

(d)	He was aware that the building had been constructed to the design of
Sherson, and he considered Mr Aplin's report as being the
opinion of one
engineer against another: "<i>...this is an engineers report against another
engineers report</i>." T, 45(55); and see further cross-examination T,
75(18-32), 84(16-85(10)), and re-examination t, 89(16)."
<P>

110   	The Second Defendant emphasises that Mr Bailey conceded
that he was not a structural engineer and quotes Mr Bailey's further
evidence
at T, 60(35-51) as follows:
<P>

"Q.	So you were relying on your own structural engineering expertise as to what
the effects, if any, might be of the sorts of concerns
expressed by Mr Aplin in
his July 1992 report?
<P>

A.	That is the only thing I understand, yes.
<P>

Q.	But you never asked Mr Aplin whether the only thing that you needed to worry
about was cracking?
<P>

A.	I beg your pardon?
<P>

Q.	You never asked Mr Aplin whether the only thing that you needed to worry
about was cracking?
<P>

A.	No, I didn't.
<P>

Q.	That was because you took your own decision on that?
<P>

A.	Yes."
<P>

111   	The Second Defendant then contended that as Mr Bailey did
not say in his evidence that he took that decision <i>because</i> no express
warning was given by Mr Aplin in his report that there was any danger of the
wall falling down, no such inference should
now be drawn.  This was said to be
by reason of the evidence by Mr Bailey that he was relying on his own
structural engineering expertise.
That this was not clarified in re-examination
should thus lead to an adverse inference based on that argument.
<P>

112   	However, a fair reading of Mr Bailey's evidence is not
that he professed expertise; rather that he eschewed any structural
engineering
expertise, not professing more than a lay understanding.  His own business was
not in that field of structural engineering.
 He interpreted the report's
reference to lateral stability as simply a warning to check for stability to
see whether there were
cracks, rather than to expect any unforewarned collapse.
Although with the wisdom of hindsight, that proved a wrong judgment, Mr
Bailey
was a layman, and the advice was opaque, guarded and given in the context of a
dispute with the builder.  There is no suggestion
he disregarded the advice of
the Defendants whom he had paid to avoid just this sort of risk, when none was
forthcoming from them,
save that advice which proved deficient.  Thus the
muddle brought about by Mr Bailey's inadequate appreciation of risk as a
layman,
coupled with the later engineer's inhibition in commenting on another's
work adversely, could fairly be said to be, in the ordinary
course of events,
"the very kind of thing likely to happen" as a result of the Defendants'
negligence.
<P>

113   	The Plaintiffs engaged and paid for the Defendants
precisely to obtain the protection of <i>their</i> advice, with each professing
expertise in their respective roles.  The point is made cogently be Professor
Stapleton in her article
"Duty of Care: Peripheral Parties and Alternative
Opportunities for Deterrence"  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20111%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 111 LQR 301</a> at 308:
<P>

"In contrast, where a plaintiff who had taken the opportunity to protect
himself or herself by paying for just this sort of professional
advice sues
this adviser, these countervailing reasons against liability fall away because
the payment elevates the adviser from
peripheral to a principal causal status.
We see this in <i>Smith v Eric S Bush</i> where the defendant valuer and the
intermediate contracting party had required a contractual structure which
prevented the plaintiff
securing privity with the defendant whom she had paid
to be careful in relation to a house valuation. Despite this fact (or probably
because of it) .... she was rightly held to be owed a duty of care by that
party in relation to the valuation."
<P>

27	 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%20AC%20831" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] AC 831</a> 
<P>

114   	One may contrast a local authority and what may be called
its peripheral status in providing advice to the purchaser of a
property and
the engaged adviser who has principal causal status because principally relied
upon, in circumstances where it is reasonable
so to do.
<P>

<b>Contributory Negligence</b>
<P>

115   	The contrasting position between contributory negligence
and liability for negligence to another party is most clearly stated
in
<i>Daniels v Anderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 438</a> where at 574 Clarke and Sheller
JJ said:
<P>

"In our opinion this submission overlooks the difference between contributory
negligence and liability in negligence to another
party.  As we have pointed
out, in the latter case the court is concerned to determine whether B has
breached a duty of care which
it owes A, an exercise which involves the
application of established principles of foreseeability and proximity.  In the
former case
the court is concerned with an entirely different issue -- whether
A, the plaintiff, has failed to take reasonable care for its own
protection.
Fleming, <i>The Law of Torts</i> 8th ed (1992) at 242 cites the Restatement in
support of the proposition that `contributory negligence is a plaintiff's
failure to
meet the standard of care to which it is required to conform for its
own protection and which is a legally contributing cause, together
with the
defendant's default, in bringing about its injury."
<P>

116   	The Court of Appeal went on to conclude that the type of
duty that the defendant owes to the plaintiff will affect the degree
to which
the plaintiff may be said to be contributorily negligent such that in some
situations the nature of the defendant's duty
may preclude liability at all or
reduce it (at 568).  However, as the High Court affirmed in <i>Astley v
Austrust Limited</i> (1999) 161 ALR 155; 73 ALJR 403, reaffirming <i>Davies v
Adelaide Chemical &amp; Fertiliser Company Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1946/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2074%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 74 CLR 541</a> a
plaintiff can still be guilty of contributory negligence, even where the
defendant has breached either a statutory or contractual
duty of care to
protect the plaintiff from the very loss which the plaintiff has suffered as a
result of the defendant's breach of
duty.
<P>

117   	The Defendants contend that for the modest cost of under
$10,000 and with a warning so sufficiently explicit, the Plaintiffs
at the
least failed to take proper care for their own or their property's protection,
when they failed to carry out the remedial
work recommended by BCS/Aplin.  
<P>

118   	This alleged failure of proper care for their own
protection the Plaintiffs first deny, contending that it was expecting
too much
of the Plaintiffs to act to carry out remedial work on the muted warning given
them and they did seek a further engineering
opinion.  The Defendants however
emphasise that the Plaintiffs were then warned by the later report of 9 July
1992 with its reference
to non-compliance with the brickwork code in terms of
lateral stability and inadequacy for the wind loads imposed on the wall and
which was against a background of the earlier warning in the BCS report of 9
May 1992.  They contend that in the context of the series
of reports received,
it was not expecting too much of a laymen to have at least understood the need
for taking remedial steps and
taken them. To this the Plaintiffs respond in two
ways.  First, by asserting that the advice in the report was not so explicit as
to make it unreasonable for Mr Bailey to act only as he did;  see above.
Second, they contend that proper care on the Plaintiffs'
part for their own
protection could not require them to implement the proposal that was put to
them, given that it would not have
prevented the failure of the building in the
conditions that occurred.  It is necessary now to turn to the conflict of the
expert
evidence on that matter.
<P>

119   	The Plaintiffs' expert, Mr Low, in his final report of 28
April 1999 concludes in these terms.
<P>

"Although the building would have been considerably strengthened had the works
priced by BCS been carried out, in my opinion it
is more probable than not that
collapse would still have occurred, despite these works.  The reasons for this
opinion are as follows
--
<P>

1.	Provision of only one column (Item 2A) to brace the western wall is
inadequate.  There would need to be at least two such columns
to satisfy the
Masonry Code AS3700 in respect of the brick wall panel strength.
<P>

2.	In my opinion the proposals do not address the problem of transferring the
wind forces from the roof plane into the walls and
thence to the ground.  For
example, the forces in the new members numbered 2B, 4 and 6 cannot be
transferred to the ground.
<P>

3.	The roof tie downs were not installed in accordance with Sherson's drawings,
as referred to in paragraph 3.4 of my report dated
3rd July 1998, and Aplin's
design does not address this."
<P>

120   	In so concluding, he differs from the Second Defendant's
expert Mr Hans Jensen who, at para 4.3 of his report of 4 December
1998 states:
"Had the owner acted on the findings it is, in my opinion more than likely that
the partial collapse of the building
would have been avoided." By "findings",
he is referring to the "Engineer's details" appended to the quotation to which
earlier reference
has been made.  This provided for a remedial cost of $7,800
based on the construction details provided by Mr Aplin and the costing
provided
by BCS. However, Mr Jensen, in cross-examination, acknowledged that, as to the
BCS proposal at pages 77-80 of PX1, "these
documents in my opinion are
incomplete so acting on them would not necessarily solve the problems" (T,
197(5)). He agreed that any
assumption that the BCS proposal of 8 August 1992
represented the details of the work necessary to make the building safe, would
be incorrect; see T, 197(22). He also conceded that the prices contained in the
BCS quotation totalling $7,800 "were premature because
it could not, could not
represent the totality of the necessary work to make the building safe"; T,
197(30).
<P>

121   	Mr Jensen agreed that, as to the work proposed in the BCS
report, it was not possible to protect the buildings' future behaviour
should
that work be done, T, 197(35-39).
<P>

122   	Mr Jensen also agreed, from his observations of the
drawings and the information provided to him, that the structure as built
lacked a viable load path to transfer wind loads to the ground; T, 197(55).
<P>

123   	Indeed Mr Jensen made a further report of 10 May 1999 in
which he said: 
<P>

"When the Jensen Report in 4.3 (last paragraph) refers to remedial work that
should have been carried out by the owner to avoid
a collapse, it refers to
"...the findings of the reports it (the owner) received ...". In other words,
reference is made to all reports
received and not just to BCS's quotation. It
is, of course, implicit in the Jensen Report that any redesign to be carried
out to
upgrade the building would be a design complying with ALL relevant
Australian Standards and Codes.
<P>

Whilst the Low Report concedes that the building would have been "considerably
strengthened" had the BCS proposed work been carried
out, it still expresses a
view that it is more probable than not that the collapse would still have
occurred despite the BCS remedial
work.
<P>

Bearing in mind that:
<P>

(a)	the BCS proposed remedial work as set out on its "part plan" provides <i>no
sizes</i> to the various structural elements to be added (such as columns,
diagonal compression members and the like), and
<P>

(b)	that associated engineering details are not available,
<P>

I do not believe that an engineer could reasonably express a conclusion as to
the building's ability to withstand a design windload.
 I therefore do not
agree with the Low Report's conclusion that one event is more likely to occur
than another event."
<P>

124   	Then, in para 3, he concludes:
<P>

"When the Jensen report in 4.3 (last paragraph) refers to remedial work that
should have been carried out by the owner to avoid
a collapse, it refers to
"...the findings of the reports it (the owner) received ...".  In other words,
reference is made to all
reports received and not just to BCS's quotation.  It
is, of course, implicit in the Jensen Report that any redesign to be carried
out to upgrade the building would be a design complying with ALL relevant
Australian Standards and Codes.
<P>

The issue to be  addressed is not whether or not the BCS proposal is
structurally adequate but whether or not the building would
have survived the
windstorm in November 1994 if the owner had acted on the various reports
submitted to him and, as a consequence,
commissioned a professional and
complying redesign and associated upgrading of the building."
<P>

125   	Thus Mr Jensen shifted his ground from a confident
assertion that the BCS proposals would have more likely than not averted
the
partial collapse of the building to expressing disbelief that an engineer could
reasonably express a conclusion as to the buildings'
ability to withstand a
design wind load.  Yet he then put upon the lay owner the responsibility to
commission "a professional and
complying re-design and associated upgrading of
the building".  This he said was what acting on the various reports submitted
to
him entailed.
<P>

126   	But it is apparent from a reading of the reports that
there is no suggestion that the BCS/Aplin proposals were, so far as
<i>their</i> authors were concerned, insufficient to carry out the necessary
remedial work.  Certainly there was no recommendation that proper
remediation
required a "professional and complying re-design and associated upgrading of
the building".  
<P>

127   	The Plaintiffs correctly point out that the Defendants
thus shifted their ground from saying that all the owner had to do
to avoid the
collapse was to carry out building works for about $7,800 to the assertion that
Mr Bailey was obliged to "commission
a professional and complying design and
associated upgrading of the building".
<P>

128   	The Plaintiffs correctly point out that the Defendants,
who have the onus in such a contention, did not attempt to identify
what works
would be required to satisfy complying design or upgrading nor prepare a
specification for such work, nor attempt a costing
in order to see whether it
would have been reasonable for Mr Bailey to have carried out the work. 
<P>

129   	In answering the question whether Mr Bailey acted
reasonably, the issue of expenditure needs to be identified and any concession
from Mr Bailey that $7,800 was affordable is rendered nugatory once the ground
shifted to requiring a fresh commissioning of remedial
work.  Mr Bailey in fact
was not able to proceed with the second stage of the building because he did
not have the funds to do so
(T, 38(36-54); T, 40(54)).  Therefore the
assumption of sufficient funds to carry out such work on a more expensive scale
on either
his part or his company's, is unwarranted.
<P>

130   	There was no cross-examination of Mr Bailey as to whether
he could afford to do whatever work it was that Mr Jensen had in
mind though
never specified and thus Mr Bailey had no opportunity to consider and give
evidence about and to adduce if necessary
expert evidence about this
hypothetical and unspecified remedial work proposed by Mr Jensen. No question
was put to him in cross-examination
about his alleged failure to "commission a
professional and complying re-design".
<P>

131   	The absence of such cross-examination would make it quite
unfair for the Defendants to seek to have the Court find that the
Plaintiffs'
"decision" was unreasonable, when the very matters going to reasonableness had
never been put to Mr Bailey.
<P>

132   	Turning to the evidence of the other experts, it is fair
to say that no expert was prepared to say more than that the implementation
of
the Aplin/BCS proposals would have strengthened the western wall; see Low T,
146(35).  The Plaintiffs' other expert, Mr Keighran,
said no more than such
result was "debatable"; T, 155(25).
<P>

133   	Mr Aplin's evidence, when pressed, was that such works
would have produced only a "lower probability of collapse"; T, 184(27).
 He
could not "categorically say" that such works would be "adequate"; T, 187(23).
At T, 186(27) he could not categorically say that
"the wall would have been
completely stable after that work was done because I mean it is difficult to
add piers to a wall that is
already constructed. He did not regard such
re-design as a "normal situation" and he was plainly uncomfortable at accepting
any responsibility
for such work; T, 188(28-35).
<P>

134   	Mr Aplin agreed that the construction of one column in
the western wall was insufficient to overcome the problem and that
the building
would not then comply with the masonry code; T, 189(6-14). He added that it was
necessary to have at least two columns;
T, 189(41).  Mr Jensen as expert for
the Engineer, said "at least two" were required; T, 198(8); the BCS/Aplin
proposals provided
for only one such column.
<P>

135   	Mr Low, whom I found impressive in his expertise and the
fairness with which he gave his evidence, said that the Aplin remedy
was not
adequate and that other walls suffered the same problems as the western wall;
T, 138(5-15). Further, he gave evidence that
the large roller door in the
northern wall meant that such wall could not be relied upon for support to the
western wall; T, 149(46)-150(46)
and the plan contained in DX2. He concluded
that the Aplin method proposed "for stabilising the western wall would have
been ineffective";
T, 140(31). He further concluded that the suggested engaged
brick piers were "not in my opinion structurally viable to provide the
necessary bracing to that western wall"; T, 140(40).
<P>

136   	Mr Low pointed out that adequate roof bracing was not
part of the Aplin design, and that they "have no means of resisting;
they will
get a compression force .... But there is no means of removing that force ...
it can't be resisted"; T, 140(21-26); (30-36).
Mr Low said that the roof
bridging system was "structurally unviable", the system was "composed purely of
tension rods" and no compression
force carrying capacity; T, 148(26-40);
(33-40). He said that the "bracing became quite useless" and caused the
"rotation" in the
opposite (eastern) wall; T, 149(16-44).
<P>

137   	Mr Jensen conceded that, as to the BCS proposal in pages
77-80 of PX1 that "these documents in my opinion are incomplete
so acting on
them would not necessarily solve the problem". T, 197(5).  He agreed that any
assumption that the BCS report of 8 August
1992 represented the details of the
work necessary to make the building safe, would be incorrect; T, 197(22).  He
agreed that, as
regards PX1 page 80, "that prices in document 80 from the
bundle were premature because it was not, could not represent the totality
of
the necessary work to make the building safe"; T, 197(30)
<P>

138   	Mr Jensen agreed that, as to the work proposed in the BCS
report, it was not possible to predict the building's future behaviour
should
that work be done; T, 197(35-39).
<P>

139   	Mr Jensen agreed that, from his observations of the
drawings and the information provided to him, the structure as built
lacked a
viable load path to transfer wind loads to the ground; T, 197(55).
<P>

140   	Summing up: 
<P>

(1)	The Defendants have failed to establish that adopting the BCS/Aplin
proposals would more probably than not have enabled the
building to withstand
the wind loads which led to its collapse, the onus being upon them to do so.
Indeed I am satisfied that it
is more likely than not that the additional
strengthening would not have saved the building from collapse, based on Mr
Low's evidence
which I accept in preference to that of the other experts, where
in conflict.
<P>

(2)	The Defendants have failed to substantiate that it would have been
reasonable, taking proper care for the Plaintiffs' own protection,
for the
Plaintiffs, and in particular Mr Bailey, to "commission a professional and
complying design and associated upgrading of the
building", having failed to
articulate what such complying re-design and associated upgrading of the
building would entail both as
to specification and cost and in particular
having failed to put any such matters to Mr Bailey in cross-examination.
<P>

141   	The foregoing findings mean that cases such as <i>Plenty
v Argus</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20WAR%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] WAR 155 (FC)</a> are not really to the point. That case held
that a defendant need not show on the balance of probabilities that particular
remedial
medical treatment would have been successful. The evidence need only
show that, having regard to the chances of success, a reasonable
person in the
position of the plaintiff would have attempted this course. If the plaintiff
unreasonably failed to undergo the treatment,
the damages should be assessed on
the basis of the actual condition, discounted by the chance that it would have
been improved by
the treatment; see <i>Plenty v Argus</i> (supra) at 158-9 per
Burt J.
<P>

142   	However, in determining the reasonableness or otherwise
of the Plaintiffs' actions, in accordance with the dicta of Jenkins
LJ in
<i>Mcauley v London Transport Executive</i> [1957] Lloyd's LLR 500 at 505, the
advice and the prospects of success of the proposed operation or treatment must
be clearly put
to the Plaintiffs so that, as a "reasonable man", he would
appreciate that he was being advised that this treatment or operation
would put
him right.
<P>

143   	Here, not even the Plaintiffs' expert Mr Jensen, was able
or prepared to predict the future behaviour of the building, and
this whether
one is considering the BCS/Aplin proposals alone or the totality of the various
reports; see his report of 10 May 1999,
paras 2 and 3, as well as his other
evidence to which I have earlier made reference.  There is of course no
suggestion that Mr Bailey
had had explained to him what the prospects of
success would likely be if the proposed BCS/Aplin proposals were implemented.
Indeed
on the Defendants' own expert evidence from Mr Jensen it was not
possible to quantify such a chance at all.
<P>

144   	As a factor not automatically in bar of contributory
negligence but relevant to any apportionment of liability and in some
circumstances capable of precluding it, is the fact that the Defendants were
under a duty respectively to supervise and advise in
relation to the very
matter of the wall's stability.  That factor, in the present circumstances
would make it "just and equitable"
in the language of <i>Daniels v Anderson</i>
(supra) at 568, that the Defendants bear all the damages in the present case.
This is so even were there, contrary to my conclusion,
a degree of fault as
distinct from understandable confusion on the Plaintiffs' part in reacting to
the various reports.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

145   	The Defendants have failed to establish that the
Plaintiffs acted unreasonably in failing either to implement the BCS/Aplin
proposal or to commission a professional and complying design and associated
upgrading of the building.  That conclusion precludes
any finding of
contributory negligence on the Plaintiffs' part.
<P>

<b>Consequences of finding that Plaintiffs have not acted unreasonably for
Causation, Damage and Contributory Negligence. </b>
<P>

146   	I consider that the Defendants should have foreseen
consequences of the same general character as that which followed, namely
the
lateral instability of the building giving rise to damage, whether by way of
total collapse or something less; compare Mason
P in <i>Kavanagh v Akhtar</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/779.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 779</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 588</a> at 602 approving the principles set out in <i>Commonwealth
v McLean</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 389</a> cited with approval by Mason P at 600.  Thus,
the damage that occurred is not such as should be excluded under any principles
of
remoteness or of reasonable foreseeability.
<P>

147   	Turning to causation, clearly enough the relevant acts
and omissions of the Defendants in the deficient treatment of the
western wall
as an internal wall satisfies the test as formulated by McHugh J in <i>Chappel
v Hart</i> (supra) where, at [27] he said: 
<P>

"If a wrongful act or omission results in an increased risk of injury to the
plaintiff and that risk eventuates, the defendant's
conduct has materially
contributed to the injury that the plaintiff suffers whether or not other
factors also contributed to that
injury occurring. If, however, the defendant's
conduct does not increase the risk of injury to the plaintiff, the defendant
cannot
be said to have materially contributed to the injury suffered by the
plaintiff."
<P>

148   	Applying the two level enquiry described by Professor
Stapleton, one reaches the same result.  Thus the first stage factual
explanation clearly establishes that both the Architect's and Engineer's
failure was at least a "but for" factor materially contributing
to the
Plaintiffs' loss.  This was not a loss which would have occurred even if the
Defendants had fulfilled their respective duties;
 compare Gaudron J in
<i>Bennett</i> at 420-1.  Second, there was insufficient in the Plaintiffs'
conduct or in the relevant circumstances as should prevent the Defendants
failure from "making a difference", in terms of their ultimate legal
responsibility in negligence;  the scope of their respective
duties of care
covered their failures in relation to the events in question.
<P>

149   	Clearly enough, the defective engineering design did as a
matter of fact and common sense result in increased risk of economic
injury to
the Plaintiffs which did eventuate when the building collapsed under high
winds.  Thus the defective design materially
contributed to that economic
injury.  Their respective duties of care was of sufficient scope, as a matter
of law, to render both
Defendants liable.
<P>

150   	The Plaintiffs' conduct could not be said to be
unreasonable for the reasons earlier stated.  It thus could not constitute
a
<i>novus actus interveniens</i> such as to interrupt the causation otherwise
made out.
<P>

151   	Accepting as Gummow J emphasised in <i>Chappel v Hart</i>
the need to temper the application of the "but for" test by the making of value
judgments and the infusion of policy considerations
(at [62]), here there is
nothing in the Plaintiffs' conduct which would justify treating the Defendants
as "peripheral actors" in
comparison to any role played by the Plaintiffs as
regards the injury they suffered. Just as, in <i>Chappel v Hart</i>, particular
emphasis was placed by Gummow J upon the fact that the very risk of which the
Plaintiffs should have been warned was
the risk that materialised (at [67]),
here, the very risk which the Plaintiffs sought to avoid by employing a design
architect and
structural engineer materialised. There is thus no evident basis
in policy for denying the Plaintiffs' remedy.
<P>

152   	As was said by Mason CJ in <i>March v Stramare</i>
(supra) at 517-8: 
<P>

"It has been said that the fact that the intervening action was foreseeable
does not mean that the negligent defendant is liable
for damage which results
from the intervening action ... But it is otherwise if the intervening action
was in the ordinary course
of things the very kind of thing likely to happen as
a result of the defendant's negligence."
<P>

153   	He went on to say (at 518-9):
<P>

"As a matter of both logic and common sense, it makes no sense to regard the
negligence of the plaintiff or a third party as a superseding
cause or novus
actus interveniens when the defendant's wrongful conduct has generated the very
risk of injury resulting from the
negligence of the plaintiff or a third party
and that injury occurs in the ordinary course of things."
<P>

154   	Here, the very kind of thing which was likely to happen
as a result of the Defendants' failure to provide an adequate structural
design
was what did occur, namely that Mr Bailey would be faced with having to make a
decision which as a layman he was ill-equipped
to make, being a decision as to
what remedial action if any to take when adventitiously confronted with the
later muted and inefficacious
advice which was received. 
<P>

155   	The Plaintiffs were confronted with having to decide on
whether to carry out recommendations, in circumstances where, had
they carried
them out, there was no demonstrated prospect that the damage that occurred
would have been averted.  Failure to do so
cannot in such circumstances make
the Plaintiffs the true author of their own harm as a <i>novus actus
interveniens</i> nor contributors to it for purposes of contributory
negligence. 
<P>

156   	Finally, it may be observed in the context of tort
damages, scepticism has been expressed by way of dicta as to whether a
plaintiff should be able to recover damages for the loss of a chance as
distinct from the all or nothing traditional approach based
on the balance of
probabilities; see Gaudron J in <i>Naxakis v Western General Hospital &amp;
Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20782" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 782</a> at paras 28 to 36. The scepticism that Gaudron J
there expresses may at some future date be visited upon the notion of
discounting
damages by reference to the loss of a chance where the plaintiff
has <i>failed</i> to take particular remedial action that offers a chance of
averting the damage that occurred. I say this, having earlier concluded
that
the Defendants have failed to establish even that threshold of an averted
chance, simply to indicate that the line of the authority
earlier referred to
including <i>Plenty v Argus</i> may fall to be re-examined at some future
date.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

157   	Turning from causation, it equally follows that the
Plaintiffs could not be said to have aggravated their damages.  Nor can
they
have failed to act reasonably in their mitigation.  And in any event mitigation
can only follow the loss not precede it. 
<P>

158   	Finally, there is no basis for reducing the Plaintiffs'
damages under the principles of contributory negligence as the Plaintiffs
did
not fail to take proper care for the protection of their property.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

159   	The defences based upon causation, <i>novus actus
interveniens</i>, and contributory negligence have not been made out nor is
there any basis for reducing the Plaintiffs' damages.
<P>

<b>COSTS AND ORDERS</b>
<P>

160   	The Plaintiffs have succeeded against both the First and
Second Defendants and they are entitled to the damages that have
been already
quantified, subject to any interest thereon not yet taken into account.  I do
not need to consider any apportionment
as between First and Second Defendants
as that has already been agreed between them.  Ordinarily, costs should follow
the event though
I give leave to the parties to address me on costs if they
wish.  I direct that the parties submit orders within twenty-one days
of the
date of this judgment.
