<b>ESTATE OF THE LATE JOAN CAROLINE BIRT</b>
<P>

<b>3597 of 1997 &amp; 1682 of 1999 - Margaret Caroline Ford v Daniel Arthur
Birt </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Two proceedings between the same parties and
relating to the same estate were heard together.  Mrs Joan Carolyn
Birt late of
Nimmitabel, New South Wales, retired school principal died on 12 March 1997
aged 55 years.  At the time of her death
she was divorced; she and Mr Arthur
Frederick Birt were married in 1961 and divorced on 2 June 1986 and she is
survived by her only
two children, Mrs Margaret Carolyn Ford the plaintiff who
was born on 20 September 1962 and Mr Daniel Arthur Birt the defendant who
was
born on 24 August 1970.  The plaintiff is often known by the nickname Marnie.
On 20 November 1998 Daniel Birt obtained probate
of Joan Birt's last will dated
21 November 1996.  Under the provisions which took effect Daniel Birt was
appointed sole executor
and was given the whole of Joan Birt's estate.  There
were provisions in the will which might have conferred benefits on Margaret
Ford if Daniel Birt had not survived Joan Birt and taken an interest under the
will; in that case Margaret Ford would have received
the net income of the
estate for life, with provision for her children.
<P>

2  	In the 1997 proceedings Margaret Ford claims provision for her
maintenance and advancement in life under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a>
out of the estate and notional estate of Joan Birt.  She seeks an order
designating several items of property as notional estate.
 The items include
Joan Birt's interest as tenant-in-common in the rural property called
"Hurlstone", and money in a bank account
which was transferred to Daniel Birt
shortly before her death.
<P>

3  	In the 1999 proceedings Margaret Ford claimed that she has an
equitable interest as owner of a house built in 1996 and surrounding
40
hectares of Hurlstone and alternatively a charge to secure an equitable
interest.  She also claims ancillary remedies. Her two
claims are not
cumulative on each other.  The two proceedings were heard together. 
<P>

4  	Hurlstone is a rural property about 9 kilometres east of
Nimmitabel and about 47 kilometres south-east of Cooma, with frontage
to the
Kybeyan Road which is tar sealed.  Mr Valuer Trethewey says:- "<i>The land is
described as a mix of undulating to hilly country, steep in parts with granite
base soils.  Some 35 hectares joining the
Kybeyan Road is gently undulating
mostly cleared country, however, the land falls steeply into a gully that runs
north-south through
the property some 500 metres east of the road boundary.
The gully obstructs access to the remainder of the land which is a mix of
hilly
and steep country, mostly heavily timbered with isolated pockets of clearings."
</i>Mr Trethewey also says<i> "The land is currently used for residential
purposes and light grazing which is considered to be the highest and best
use."</i>  The evidence speaks of a number of rural activities which have been
carried out there but Daniel Birt's principal activity there
now is running
about 350 sheep.  The area is spoken of in evidence as 640 acres but this is
not exactly correct according to dimensions
stated on deposited plans.  There
are two freehold holdings, Lot 2 Deposited Plan 732581 which has a frontage to
Kybeyan Road to
the west, and by plan has 126.8 hectares excluding the road,
and Lot 55 DP 7505662 to its east, containing by plan 126.8 hectares
or 320
acres.  There is also a small area formerly a school site referred to variously
as Crown leasehold and permissive occupancy;
this cannot be of significant
value.  Mr Trethewey's evidence including his revaluation, which I accept,
establishes the value of
the property at $240,000 as of 7 June 1999.  It also
establishes that the value of the cottage on a notional 5 ha lot would be
$85,000,
being $30,000 for the land and $55,000 for improvements.  There has
been no subdivision, and while approval would not be impossible,
there would be
uncertainty and difficulty in getting approval.
<P>

5  	Joan Birt purchased Hurlstone in 1990 and caused the property to
be transferred by the vendors Mr and Mrs Cratchley to Daniel
Birt and herself
as joint tenants.  The consideration stated in the transfer was $209,425.  The
purchase money was raised by borrowing
$110,000 or thereabouts from State Bank
of New South Wales and the balance was contributed by Joan Birt.  Daniel Birt,
who was then
19 years of age and had no significant resources of his own, made
no contribution to the purchase, except that he joined in the mortgage.
 After
several years the mortgage to the State Bank was discharged with money obtained
from Commonwealth Bank of Australia under
a mortgage dated 30 April 1993.  
<P>

6  	The Commonwealth Bank mortgage in turn was discharged by
Discharge dated 26 August 1996 and later registered, on payment on
19 April
1996 of $106,177.01 from the superannuation entitlement received by Joan Birt
on resigning her employment.  At the time
of her death she was still proprietor
of Hurlstone jointly with Daniel Birt; legal ownership then passed to him on
her death by survivorship.
 However on 7 March 1995 five days before her death
Joan Birt signed a series of documents prepared for her by Mr John Clarke
solicitor
of Cooma.  Although the instructions for these documents were
conveyed to Mr Clarke by Daniel Birt, Joan Birt's conduct when Mr Clarke
brought the papers to her at Hurlstone for execution shows that they were fully
understood by her and intended to have effect.  The
documents were contract for
the sale by her to Daniel Birt of her interest described as "<i>The Vendor's
one-half share in the land, the improvements, all fixtures and inclusions</i>
..." for $120,000, a Memorandum of Transfer dated 7 March 1997 acknowledging
receipt of consideration of $120,000 and transferring
her interest to Daniel
Birt, and two acknowledgments or letters of the same date, one from Joan Birt
to Mr Clarke's firm saying "I
advise that all moneys payable with respect to
this transfer have been received" and the other from Joan Birt to Daniel Birt
saying
"I hereby forgive any moneys that may be owed by you to me".  The
substance of these events was that on 7 March 1997 Joan Birt made
a donation of
her equitable interest in the property to Daniel Birt; the donation was
effective in equity because he was in a position
to have the transfer
registered, and Mr Clarke proceeded in his interest to register it, although
registration took place after Joan
Birt had died.
<P>

7  	At the time of her death Joan Birt owned an interest in the
partnership business which conducted rural operations on Hurlstone,
and in the
plant, stock and equipment thereof.  Joan Birt was entitled to 75% of the
income of the partnership and Daniel Birt to
25%; presumably interests in the
partnership assets were in the same proportion.  However the partnership
accounts in evidence show
that she had an entitlement as against the
partnership to capital worth far more than the assets of the partnership
actually were
worth, so that on winding-up partnership affairs at the time of
her death all assets would have gone to her.  All assets of hers
including her
interest in the partnership passed to Daniel Birt under her will.  His own
nominal interest in partnership assets was
of no value.
<P>

8  	Joan Birt and her then husband Arthur Birt lived in Cabramatta in
Margaret Ford's early childhood.  Joan Birt set up and conducted
a pre-school,
then obtained formal qualifications as a teacher and did relief teaching work.
They made several moves; they lived
in Menai, then in 1979 to 1981 in Nowra
where they conducted a boat-hire business, then in Woronora. About 1985 Joan
Birt moved to
Goulburn where she had a teaching position.  About this time she
bought a house property with about 30 acres near Goulburn; it seems
likely that
she used some proceeds of the home at Woronora which she received under a
matrimonial property settlement for this purchase.
 About 1989 Joan Birt moved
to Cooma and taught at Monaro High School; she sold the Goulburn the property
at about this time.  Later
she became principal of Delegate Primary School, and
while working there she returned to Hurlstone at week-ends.  She resigned from
the Department of School Education on 1 April 1996 and received $20,667.57 for
long service and recreation leave.  She also received
$260,941.49 for
superannuation entitlements.  She may later have done some casual teaching.
<P>

9  	On 12 April 1996 the Superannuation payment of $260,941.49 was
deposited into a partnership bank account no. 720160570-82; kept
by Joan Birt
and Daniel Birt at the State Bank the previous balance was $13,707.  Evidence
does not show how the long service and
leave payment of $20,667.57 was applied
or whether it contributed to that previous balance.  A few days later the
partnership bank
account was drawn against for $106,177.10 to pay out the
mortgage to the Commonwealth Bank.  This operated as a benefaction to the
defendant as he was a party to the mortgage and a joint owner of the land.
<P>

10  	In 1996 Joan Birt also received distributions in the estate of
her late mother, and these were also deposited into the same
partnership bank
account: $57,500 on 21 June 1996; $66,000 on 9 October 1996; $1,264.45 on 4
December 1996.
<P>

11  	After deducting the amount repaid on the mortgage the moneys
which came to hand for Joan Birt in these ways from 12 April 1996
to the end of
the year amounted to $300,196.50.
<P>

12  	The disposition of the amounts received by the testatrix is
explained, in part but not fully, by a table of payments in Exhibit
G, which
was prepared on behalf of the defendant while these proceedings were pending.
These show many payments which are readily
acceptable as connected with the
operation of Hurlstone and rural enterprises there, payments for vehicles and
equipment and payments
for building materials and services relating to
constructing the cottage.  (The payments identified as relating to construction
total
$32,610.39).  Several large payments relate to attempts to establish
ostrich farming on Hurlstone, which has been a business failure.
 Expenses
directly related to ostrich farming are:
<P>

<i>June 4, 1996	Bank transfer					$40,000</i>
<P>

<i>June 13, 1996	Cheque to Australian Ostrich Association	$ 5,000</i>
<P>

<i>January 31, 1997  Purchase of 19 ostriches			$13,537.50</i>
<P>

13  	The $40,000 was transferred to a bank account of the testatrix
at Colonial State Bank, Account No. 720107534-00 described as
"Hurlstone
Ostrich Facility Account".  Further dealings with moneys in that account are
not explained and the amount held in the
account at the testatrix' death was
$1,175.79.  I accept that the amounts referred to were in fact expended in
connection with the
ostrich venture and are not now represented by any asset of
significant value.  A cash withdrawal of $20,000 on 8 August 1996 from
the
partnership bank account is unexplained. No basis exists for a finding of how
the testatrix disposed of this sum, and there is
no basis for finding that
either the plaintiff or the defendant got the benefit of it.
<P>

14  	In the inventory of property filed with the probate application
Daniel Birt showed property at the following values.
<P>

Furniture and jewellery					$ 1,000.00
<P>

Colonial State Bank account no. 720107534-00	$ 1,175.79
<P>

Taxation Credits						$23,865.11
<P>

1985 Mitsubishi Cordia					<u>$  2,000.00</u>
<P>

Total:								$28,040.90
<P>

He also showed the interest in the farming partnership without attributing a
value to it.  He incurred legal costs of $962 for the
probate application.
<P>

15  	The financial statements of the partnership business for the
financial period ending on the date of Joan Birt's death in Exhibit
F show the
total partnership equity and the net assets at $94,843.08.  Interests in the
partnership equity were shown as Joan Birt
$408,315.83 and Daniel Birt
($312,472.75) negative, producing a balance equal to the net assets. The
probabilities are that on depositing
money in the partnership bank accounts
Joan Birt became entitled to a corresponding credit in the partnership capital
account which
Daniel Birt was in no position to pay out.  In my view the
interest in the partnership assets which passed to Daniel Birt under the
will
should be valued at $94,843.08.
<P>

16  	The partnership balance sheet as at 12 March 1997 did not
include any cash at bank.  On 10 March 1997 there was a balance in
the
partnership bank account of $87,501.98 but on that day it was transferred to an
account no. 720108414-81 conducted by the defendant
solely, also with the
Colonial State Bank.  
<P>

17  	I find that assets which passed to Daniel Birt in the last five
days of Joan Birt's life or under her will are valued as follows:
<P>

Assets in Probate Inventory		$  28,040.90
<P>

Partnership assets				$  94,843.08
<P>

Gift of joint interest in Hurlstone	$120,000.00
<P>

Cash from partnership account	<u>$  87,501.98</u>
<P>

total						<u>$330,385.96</u>
<P>

18  	The legal costs of $962 relating to probate application are the
only debt or testamentary expense referred to in evidence.
 I asked the parties
to show by evidence what costs have been incurred in the proceedings.  The
evidence of Mr Wall solicitor for
the plaintiff estimated the plaintiff's total
costs of the proceedings on a solicitor and client basis at approximately
$113,525.55.
 He estimated the party and party costs would be about 80 to 90%
of that sum, and taking median amount I treat that as $96496.71.
 He estimated
that about $15,000 of the party and party costs would be attributable to the
1999 proceedings and to interlocutory
proceedings relating to a caveat.  The
estimate of costs given on affidavit by the defendant's solicitor, Mr Clarke,
was $66,000
to the completion of the proceedings.
<P>

19  	I regard both these estimates as astonishingly large and I
cannot understand how sums of that order can have been spent on
a controversy
like this.  Expenditures of those kinds appear to me to be quite
disproportionate to the importance which success or
failure could have to
either party, or to any legal work the need for which is at this point apparent
to me.  I have not yet decided
what orders for costs should be made, by which
party costs will be payable or whether they will be payable out of the estate
and
the notional estate.  I can do no more in addressing the plaintiff's claim
than to have regard to the probability that large sums
of costs will be payable
out of the estate.
<P>

20  	When Joan Birt died Daniel Birt already owned another interest
in Hurlstone derived from earlier benefactions, and that joint
interest should
be valued at $120,000.  Hurlstone was then unincumbered.  As a single man 27
years of age without dependants and
already for some years engaged in farming
activity on Hurlstone he was left in a relatively strong financial position.
He is now
29 years of age, unmarried and without dependents.  The form of the
assets has been changed somewhat as he has purchased some stock
and equipment
and no longer has significant funds in cash. As well as grazing sheep on
Hurlstone he has other ventures including
sharefarming cattle on one
neighbour's property and a lease of small area of another neighbour's property,
and he makes some seasonal
earnings as a security guard.  He is still in a
relatively strong financial position, which very largely arises from
benefactions
made to him by Joan Birt, although his position has been
contributed to by his own work in the partnership and otherwise. 
<P>

21  	The plaintiff's life has been rather unsettled.  About 1978 when
the plaintiff was 16 she left her parents' then home at Menai.
 A few months
earlier she had damaged the family car.  After living separately from her
parents for 8 or 9 months she returned to
their home which they then
established in Nowra.  She helped her parents in their boat hire business
there.  Towards the end of 1979
she started to live with Terrence Patrick Ford,
whom she married in February 1980.  They lived in a caravan at the boat hire
business
in Nowra, and later in a rented home unit in Nowra.  Their daughter
Cheryl Anne Ford was born on 28 January 1981.  After that Margaret
Ford her
husband and daughter lived in many places; they lived in Queensland for about
three months in 1981, then returned to Nowra
where they lived in a caravan
park.  Later they lived in Goulburn, and in Queensland for about six months.
They stayed for a short
time in her parents' home in Woronora.  They rented a
house in Sylvania.  From about 1982 onwards they lived in Nowra for several
years; then about 1987 when Joan Birt was established in her property at
Goulburn, they went to live in Garathy Street Goulburn.
 About 1987 Margaret
Ford had major surgery for a liver tumour and was unwell for many months.  They
began to move again, and settled
in Jervis Bay for several years.  In September
1991 they moved to Hurlstone at Joan Birt's invitation; then they rented a
house near
Nimmitabel and operated a roadhouse at Nimmitabel.  At one time in
the early 1990's they owned a property at Mungar Queensland; after
the sale of
that property and meeting various obligations, including making a payment to Mr
A.H. Birt, they had around $38,000 to
$40,000.  This was used to buy land in
Nimmitabel, to buy a car, and a lot of it was used in the roadhouse; Margaret
Ford said "...
it just got eaten up in the roadhouse."  They purchased two
blocks of unimproved town land in Nimmitabel for $6,000.  The road house
business failed.  In 1995 they went to live in Pambula where Terrence Ford
operated a second-hand goods shop.  It is unlikely that
Mr and Mrs Ford ever
had any greater amount of capital than they had after selling the house in
Mungar.
<P>

22  	Terrence Ford has had many employments and occupations.  At
times he has made good earnings, but his changes of employment
have been
frequent.  When the hearing began he was in good employment as Sales Manager at
Martyn Ford Cooma, where he commenced work
about May or June 1998.  However he
lost his employment on 2 July 1999 after a dispute with one of the proprietors.
Before obtaining
that employment he had received Disability Pension for several
years from about 1995; it seems probable that he will again depend
on the
Disability Pension.  He is able to make some casual earnings as a musician.

<P>

23  	Margaret Ford has also had many employments.  At the time of the
hearing she was working part-time in a bakery in Nimmitabel;
her earnings
varied very greatly according to the availability of work.  She said that the
gross earnings varied between $140 per
week and $500 per week.  Their daughter
who is now 18 has left their household.  
<P>

24  	So far as can be seen from evidence, until the last year of her
life Joan Birt's most significant asset was her mortgaged interest
in
Hurlstone; her asset position arose very largely from her earnings in her
teaching career, there is no other discernible source
except that she may have
received proceeds of the former matrimonial home in a property settlement, and
she had little opportunity
to make benefactions until she received her
Superannuation entitlement and distributions from her mother's estate.
<P>

25  	It would be understandable that a parent might not think highly
of or give approval to the careers of Margaret Ford and her
husband.  They have
a long history of rootlessness, with many moves and several financial failures;
Terence Ford had been bankrupt
three times, and Margaret Ford twice, more
recently through her involvement in the roadhouse.  There are many worse ways
to disappoint
a parent than by having several business failures.  Their
marriage has been a constant to their lives for almost 20 years and their
daughter is now adult.  Margaret Ford suffered a severe reverse in her health
some years ago, and Terrence Ford is in a state of
health where when he does
not have employment it has been accepted that he is entitled to a Disability
Pension.  It is a fact of
Margaret Ford's life that she was never given any
advancement or means of establishing herself in life by either parent; from the
course her life has taken it would not have been easy to help her.  She did not
have any education or training which has equipped
her for a career.  At her age
and stage in life this is at least as much her responsibility as it could be
thought of as her parents'
responsibility, but it is a fact of her existence
that she has not had training or establishment in life and now has no security
of any kind, either in the form of home ownership, stable employment or
reliable dependence on earnings of a male provider.  The
contrast between her
situation in terms of assets and means of maintaining herself and that of
Daniel Birt is very marked, particularly
as Daniel Birt's position arises
largely, almost entirely from benefactions.  The benefactions given to him
point out that in the
terms on which this family has lived it is appropriate
that there be some establishment in life, and give some indication of an
appropriate
scale.  The history of repeated business failures and the lack of
success of Margaret Ford and her husband in establishing themselves
in life are
a restraining factor on the generosity of any benefaction.
<P>

26  	There is nothing in evidence which I regard as a reliable basis
for a finding what were Joan Birt's reasons for the shape which
her
benefactions took.  It seems likely, from some inconclusive discussion, and
from the protective nature of the provisions in the
will which did not take
effect, that she felt strong concerns about the financial responsibility of
Margaret Ford and her husband
and the use to which any benefactions may be put.
Signs of these concerns are reflected in two documents in Joan Birt's
handwriting
which are in evidence and express uncompleted projects for
providing Margaret Ford with housing.
<P>

27  	In evidence a great deal of attention was given to events from
about June 1996 onwards and to communications among the parties
relating to the
construction of a new cottage on Hurlstone.  Margaret Ford and her husband have
occupied the workman's cottage from
its completion late in December 1996 until
the present, and the claim in the 1999 proceedings relates to an interest in
it.  Although
these subjects have some significance, in retrospect the
attention given to them appears to have been excessive.
<P>

28  	Margaret Ford appears to have maintained a good relationship
appropriate for a daughter with her mother throughout her life
and
notwithstanding what must have been strains and difficulty arising from her
unsettled life, many moves and financial vicissitudes.
 In evidence which I
accept Margaret Ford speaks of assistance she gave to her parents including her
mother at various times throughout
her adult life, including assistance in the
boat hire business at Nowra, and later, particularly in rural work and
housework at Hurlstone.
 The burden has never been great, but it was
appropriate for her to undertake it.  She should not be treated as a person who
has
neglected her mother or disregarded the relationship.
<P>

29  	In a conversation in January 1996, when Margaret Ford and her
husband lived in Pambula where they ran a second-hand goods store,
Joan Birt
showed awareness of the plaintiff's needy condition.  In June or July 1996 Joan
Birt told Margaret Ford that she had received
money from her own mother's
estate and discussed giving her money so that she could have a home of her own.
There were further discussions
when Margaret Ford and her husband visited
Hurlstone and there were discussions within the family about various possible
ways of
providing housing.  Joan Birt suggested building a house on
Hurlstone.
<P>

30  	After this discussion Daniel Birt obtained some kit home plans.
There was a further discussion about August 1996 about the
possibility of
subdividing part of Hurlstone, and various locations were considered and
discussed.  In evidence there are several
plans illustrating locations that
were considered, and also evidence of Joan Birt's having pointed out a
location.  All these passages
of evidence are inconclusive to identify any
particular piece of land in any way which would establish its size or
boundaries. I
accept on the basis of the plaintiff's evidence that Joan Birt
pointed out the location of the house site on one occasion by pointing
to the
land she had in mind and speaking of its boundaries and on at least one other
occasion by referring to a topographical map
which is not in evidence, and that
she referred to the area as 100 acres.  However there is no evidence from which
any particular
area of 100 acres which was the subject of her intention can be
identified, and is not clear that she ever did fully and clearly
identify
boundaries in any expression of her intention.
<P>

31  	There was discussion about arranging a building application and
arranging for electricity supply (which affected the location
of the house).
In evidence there is an application to Cooma Monaro Council for approval for
construction of the cottage, referring
to building approval, development
approval, installation of septic tank and insulation of a solid fuel heater;
this application is
part of Exhibit 6 which also contains the Town Planner's
report.  The application was made in the sole name of Joan Birt as owner
and
signed by her only on 19 August 1996.  It was approved by delegation on 30
September 1996 and a building permit was issued to
her dated 2 October 1996
Exhibit 6.  An application to instal a septic tank Exhibit 9 dated 19 August
1996 was also made and signed
by Joan Birt solely as owner.  These applications
do not deal with development consent for subdivision or with approval of
subdivision
plans, and no application made to Council ever related to a
proposed subdivision.
<P>

32  	About August or September 1996 Margaret Ford and her husband
sold the second-hand goods business, that is to say they sold
the stock to a
person who obtained a lease for the same premises from their landlord,
terminated their house lease at Pambula and
on 26 September 1996 moved to
Hurlstone, where they at first lived in a caravan.  From October 1996 onwards
construction of the new
house proceeded.  Construction was carried out on the
basis that Joan Birt was an owner-builder.  Terrence Ford did much of the
labour,
and specialist contractors were brought in for skilled building work.
Daniel Birt also contributed some labour towards preparing
the site, a
relatively small part of the work.  Materials and contractors were paid for
largely by Joan Birt by payments out of the
partnership bank account, which
then contained relatively large sums arising from her deposits.  She indicated
that $30,000 would
be available for this purpose but in fact $32,610.39 was
paid out of this account for materials and contractors.  In addition Margaret
Ford and her husband paid other sums which they estimate at $7,000 or $8,000
for building materials.  Joan Birt also gave them a
Woodland fire worth $800
which was installed in the house and Daniel Birt gave them a front door worth
$240 which was also installed
in the house.  The house was habitable although
not completed late in December 1996 and Margaret Ford and her husband moved in.

<P>

33  	The defendant erected an electric fence around the building
during the building operations.  I am satisfied that this was done
to keep
stock away from the building materials.  In no way was it an indication of an
agreed boundary.
<P>

34  	On 26 September 1996, the day the Fords moved to Hurlstone, the
testatrix fell ill, and was taken to hospital by ambulance.
 Her condition was
diagnosed as cancer and developed rapidly so that she survived for less than
six months.  During that time she
spent some periods in hospitals, and in the
last months of her life she was very restricted, largely bedridden and in need
of much
care, including nursing care.  The plaintiff contributed appropriately
to her care, as did the defendant.
<P>

35  	From late October 1996 Margaret Ford was employed part time on
Hurlstone by the partnership, and was credited with wages of
$96 per fortnight.
This was not paid to her in cash, and part of it was later appropriated by Joan
Birt to pay $1400 for plumbing
work completed on the new house after
occupation.  The employment was not nominal and Margaret Ford in fact did part
time work on
Hurlstone, both farm work and assistance to Joan Birt in the
house.
<P>

36  	The plaintiff's 1999 proceedings bring forward for determination
a contention that arrangements between Margaret Ford and Joan
Birt have already
conferred on Margaret Ford an equitable interest in the new house and
surrounding land.  
<P>

37  	The defendant's solicitor contended and conducted his case on
the basis that arrangements between Joan Birt and Margaret Ford
had created a
life tenancy, and made an open offer under which the defendant made available
to the plaintiff a somewhat more ample
position see t.11, 29 and 37; to the
effect that the defendant would transfer the house and the surrounding 5 acres
later amended
to 5 hectares,freehold to the plaintiff, on conditions that,
although the defendant was to pay the cost of the subdivision, Margaret
Ford
was to repay it on any sale (and the costs were to be secured by a mortgage)
and that the plaintiff was to securely fence the
boundary.  Another condition
was that a right of way 20 metres wide was to be created, presumably to give
access to Kybeyan Road.
 Generally the defendant's position was to the effect
that as the plaintiff already had an entitlement to a life estate under the
arrangement she had made with Joan Birt it was not appropriate that any further
provision should be made for her.  
<P>

38  	It is in my view clear that no arrangements between Joan Birt
and Margaret Ford created a life estate or any other legal or
equitable
interest of Margaret Ford in any part of Hurlstone.  Of course no subdivision
plan was prepared, approved by the Municipal
Council or registered as a
deposited plan, and no memorandum of transfer of any interest was ever prepared
or registered.  There
is no signed writing creating or evidencing the creation
of any equitable interest in the land and conforming with s.23C or subs.54A(1)
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a></i>.  There is no document which could arguably
be a writing, note or memorandum signed by either party for the purpose of
those provisions.
 Two different forms of a document headed "Agreement" and
written out in the handwriting of Joan Birt are in evidence.  Neither of
these
is dated or signed.  The two forms are similar but not identical.  The first
one produced by the defendant is annexure A to
his affidavit of 3 April 1998
and is wholly in Joan Birt's handwriting except for a short note written by Mr
John Clarke, solicitor.
 It is the defendant's evidence that Joan Birt gave
this document to his solicitor Mr John Clarke at his office and stated "We have
made an agreement with Marnie "(<i>meaning the plaintiff</i>)" and we want you
to put this into a legal agreement".  He says that this happened on the
occasion on 21 November 1996 when Joan
Birt signed her will.  Apart from the
statement attributed to Joan Birt that an agreement had been made with the
plaintiff there
is no evidence which would associate the plaintiff with this
document in any way.  Nor is there any evidence explaining why, if instructions
were given to make the document into a legal agreement, nothing further
happened.  At another part of the case it seemed to be suggested
that agreement
was reached about mid-December (but I do not accept that contention either.)  I
do not regard the defendant's evidence
about the statement made by Joan Birt to
Mr Clarke as reliable but if that statement were accepted it may suggest that
in Joan Birt's
view the agreement was not yet a legal agreement; the words
attributed to her are equivocal.
<P>

39  	Another version of this document is Exhibit 7; most of Exhibit 7
is also in Joan Birt's handwriting but there are extensive
pencil notes written
on it by the plaintiff.  The notes written by the plaintiff show from their
terms that she considered the expressions
in Exhibit 7 closely and did not
accept many of them.  On a whole view of Exhibit 7 it does not bear out that
there was an agreement,
however informal, in accordance with its terms and
demonstrates from the nature of the plaintiff's notes that there was not.  
<P>

40  	Evidence did not establish clearly when these two versions were
written by Joan Birt or when Margaret Ford wrote on them. 
On behalf of the
defendant it was suggested that these things happened during or in relation to
the visit by the Fords to Hurlstone
on 17, 18 and 19 August 1996 but I do not
regard that as having been established.  
<P>

41  	The plaintiff's evidence would show that she made her notes on
Exhibit 7 on a day which appears to have been about mid December,
when Mr
Benesch was at Hurlstone.  I do not accept the defendant's evidence that, in
what appears to be the outcome of the preparation
of Exhibit 7, the testatrix
gave the plaintiff an explanation to the effect that the plaintiff had an
agreement providing for a Life
Estate, that the testatrix read out the Will and
explained that the testatrix had left everything to Daniel Birt and that the
life
tenancy was created to ensure that the plaintiff had a permanent roof over
her head, and that the testatrix said that the reason
for that was to make sure
that Terrence Ford did not get hold of the property.  In my finding, the
testatrix' expressions of her
intentions reflected in Exhibit 7 did not ever
reach the stage of an arrangement or established position, even to the limited
degree
 of clarity which its terms could support.
<P>

42  	The defendant under cross-examination was in great difficulties
in explaining how it was that when he first came to give evidence
in his
affidavit of 3 April 1998 he did not produce or refer to the version which is
now Exhibit 7.  His evidence was to the effect
that he found the document now
Exhibit 7 in the house after his mother's death, and took it to his solicitor's
office about August
1997, but that he had forgotten it and it was overlooked
when he made his affidavit in April 1998 and was only found again much later.
Although he was markedly unimpressive as a witness and there is a basis on
which it could be inferred that he had attempted to suppress
Exhibit 7 I do not
regard that as a correct view of the facts; the probabilities favour a finding
that his account of finding the
document, giving it to his solicitor,
overlooking it and its later being adverted to again is correct.  However the
document in the
state it is in with the plaintiff's notes, and the end result
of those notes which show unsettled positions on a number of different
points
establishes that there was no agreement in the terms which Joan Birt wrote in
Exhibit 7.  
<P>

43  	Although Exhibit 7 is difficult to follow it does not appear to
me that it states that Margaret Ford was to have a life tenancy
or any freehold
interest.  It shows that the testatrix considered providing the plaintiff with
housing, and that she was aware of
her need in that respect, but even if
Exhibit 7 had been put into effect it would not meet the plaintiff's need for
housing by providing
any clear right to have it.  
<P>

44  	The testatrix's will, which she executed at Mr Clarke's office
in Cooma on 21 November 1996 after her hospitalisation and diagnosis,
provides
in a very limited way for the plaintiff to have income but only if the
provision for the defendant did not take effect.
 The will does not record or,
it seems to me, recognise even by implication that the plaintiff already had
any entitlement to any
interest in Hurlstone.
<P>

45  	Exhibit 7 refers internally to an attached plan, but no plan is
attached to it.  No evidence shows that there ever was an attached
plan, or
what the plan showed.  For this reason, if there were no other reason, it would
not be possible to give effect to Ex. 7.
<P>

46  	The plaintiff distinctly denied that the basis on which she
moved to Hurlstone and moved into the house was an arrangement
made by Joan
Birt under which the plaintiff would get a life Estate in the cottage.  The
plaintiff gave an account of dealings in
which Joan Birt at times held out to
the plaintiff that she would have a home and land and that Joan Birt would
contribute $30,000
as the cost of building it, but there was never anything
which could be thought of as an agreement which was enforceable, even under
the
doctrine of part performance, because there was never any real definition of
the parcel of land which was affected or any finality
in the discussion; the
discussions proceeded inconclusively and very late in her life Joan Birt told
Margaret Ford to the effect
that she had left matters in Daniel Birt's hands.
I accept that this inconclusive narration represents substantially what
happened,
and I find that no rights to the cottage and no interest in any land
has been conferred on the plaintiff. It is not established that
the plaintiff
has any claim supported by proprietary estoppel.
<P>

47  	In my finding it was contemplated by the testatrix that the
plaintiff would be given some right or some basis on which to expect
the
cottage would be her own, but what those rights were to be was never expressed
on any clear basis and never established by any
arrangement between them.
Exhibit 7 bears on its face the signs that agreement did not emerge.  Until
very late in her life the testatrix
continued to think of conferring some right
on Margaret Ford but did not ever do so, and towards the end of her life told
Margaret
Ford to the effect that she had left the matter to Daniel Birt to
attend to.  This was a strange state in which to leave her affairs,
as a person
of education with access to a lawyer.
<P>

48  	The plaintiff gave evidence to the effect that she was not aware
during her mother's lifetime that Daniel Birt was a joint
owner of Hurlstone.
This was challenged with vigour, on the basis that the plaintiff had access to
papers, rate notices and other
documents, which if she had adverted to their
implications would have shown that Daniel Birt was a co-owner. Exhibit 7 seems
to suggest
in places that he was a co-owner, although its indications are not
uniform.  On some significant occasions, including applications
to Council,
Joan Birt acted as if she were the sole owner.  While Margaret Ford could well
have found out the true position if she
had thought fit to investigate it, I
see no reason why she should have done that, or why she should have carefully
considered the
implications for ownership of papers which came to her attention
when, for example, she was writing up books for the testatrix, or
which
otherwise she could have seen.  While I accept that the plaintiff did not know
until after the testatrix' death that Daniel
Birt was a co-owner, I do not
regard the subject as of any importance for the outcome of the proceedings.

<P>

49  	When the plaintiff and her husband left Pambula they had $4,000
or $5,000 cash.  The plaintiff now appears to have no assets
of substantial
value.  She and her husband jointly own two town lots at Nimmitabel, but the
highest value suggested for those lots
was $10,000; that figure was not
established by evidence.  As they had already acquired the lots before their
latest bankruptcy there
is a risk that the lots may be claimed by the trustee
of that bankruptcy.  It would be imprudent for the Fords to develop those lots.
Their most substantial asset now appears to be a new Ford Falcon car bought by
Terrence Ford.  They also have a hire purchased truck
in half shares.  
<P>

50  	The position put by Daniel Birt in his evidence was to the
effect that it was left to him what he should do for the plaintiff
with respect
of occupation of Hurlstone.  This is illustrated by the following passage in
his cross-examination:   (t. 147 Line 21
to end of p.147)
<P>

<i>"Q.	You told Marnie, didn't you, that she was not cut out of the will, that
your mother just never told her what she wanted you to
do?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	What I was to do, that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you were to determine when it was right to tell Marnie what was to be
her share of the will?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I was to tell her what I was to do for her.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So, you are saying to his Honour that it was left to you to determine
what should be done for Marnie?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was left to me what I should do for Marnie.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you were only willing to do anything for Marnie provided she earned
your trust?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I had actually already done that for Marnie, but she doesn't know about
it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What have done for Marnie that she does not know about it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I entered Marnie to my will.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So, your idea for providing for Marnie is that she will inherit in the
event that you die?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Her life estate would be maintained even if I die.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is the provision that you consider is appropriate for her?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you have, have you not, told Marnie that her home is never in danger
provided she has your trust?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And conversely, if she doesn't have your trust, her home is in danger,
that's right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not precisely."</i>
<P>

51  	When I have regard to the resources available for Joan Birt to
dispose of in the last months of her life, the claims of the
defendant and the
provision which she made to him, and when I consider whether provision ought to
be made for the plaintiff, it was
not in my opinion appropriate for Joan Birt
to direct all her benefactions to Daniel Birt, and in doing so she did not make
adequate
provision for the proper maintenance and advancement in life of the
plaintiff.  In my judgment the provision which ought to be made
for the
plaintiff by the order of the court is a provision which will provide the
plaintiff with a modest fund which will contribute
substantially, not
necessarily entirely to her need to obtain housing in or near Nimmitabel.  
<P>

52  	The nature of the defendant's claim and needs require that the
provision made for the plaintiff should be modest; the defendant
cannot engage
in farming and grazing unless he has an endowment worth several hundred
thousand dollars, and the direction which his
life has taken thus far means
that he is very much limited to that career.  His claims and those of the
plaintiff are such that he
should take substantially the greater part but not
all of the assets available.  Although it might be feasible to obtain a town
planning
and subdivision decision which would enable some part of Hurlstone
including the cottage to be subdivided so as to be given to the
plaintiff, I do
not think that this is the appropriate form for provision to take.  Hurlstone
is not by any possibility a large or
prosperous holding; light grazing is as
the valuer's evidence shows the highest and best use which can be made of it,
and any reduction
in its size would be unfortunate.  There is a history of
conflict between the parties which would be continued and possibly even
made
worse if they were to continue to occupy neighbouring houses on a rural
property 9 km from town after the decision in these
proceedings, which were
conducted with forceful advocacy and with indications of profoundly hostile
feelings.  It would be very unfortunate
if these parties lived in close
proximity in the future.
<P>

53  	The history of the plaintiff's economic life to date, and of her
husband's life, incline me towards moderation in the provision
to be ordered.
They have no real success in accumulating capital in 20 years of endeavour, he
has been bankrupt three times and she
twice.  There is some degree of hazard in
committing family funds to her prosperity, and the amount so put at risk should
be carefully
restricted.
<P>

54  	I see the possibility that the plaintiff may not use the amount
ordered to be paid to her well; for example, it might get swallowed
up in some
further business venture of her husband's.  I cannot prevent her from making
inappropriate use of a provision, but the
possibility that she might do that
does not destroy her claim to have provision which she can use towards
providing for her housing
need.  The provision will be hers, and will not
belong to her husband.  She now has considerable experience of life, much of it
adverse,
including experience of the struggle to obtain secure long-term
housing, and it appears to me to be reasonable to hope for a good
outcome.  In
my view I have dealt appropriately with the possibility that the provision
might be misused by awarding no more than
a moderate amount.
<P>

55  	I turn to address <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a>.  The
plaintiff is an eligible person.  She is a child of the testatrix.  No previous
order for provision out of the Estate has yet
been made.  In my opinion
provision ought, having regard to the circumstances at the present time, be
made for her maintenance and
advancement in life, the basis of the opinion
being the facts determined in these reasons.  In my opinion the amount of the
provision
is as set out in my orders.
<P>

56  	I turn to subs.9(2).  No provision was made in favour of the
plaintiff by the testatrix during her lifetime or out of her Estate.
<P>

57  	In terms of subs.9(3) I take into consideration contributions
made by the plaintiff by providing services for the welfare of
the testatrix,
to which I have referred in this judgment.  I also take into consideration the
character and conduct of the plaintiff.
 The defendant's solicitor contended
that her conduct disentitled her to provision.  In my opinion the plaintiff's
character and
conduct are not factors adverse to her claim. There is nothing in
her character which is of any real adverse significance on the
question of what
provision ought to be made for her out of the Estate and Notional Estate in the
context of the lives and personal
histories of the family members.  The
unsettled lives, many moves from place to place, history of failed projects and
bankruptcies
and failure to accumulate assets do not appear to me to be
blemishes of the plaintiff's character and conduct in relation to her
mother.

<P>

58  	It is not appropriate to exclude people who have not made an
economic success of life from testamentary benefactions and, on
the contrary,
needs associated with a person's capacity and life circumstances support a
claim for provision, within prudent limits
so that no undue proportion of the
family resources is put to further hazard.  In her personal relationship with
her mother the plaintiff
appears to me to have behaved properly, and to have
enjoyed a good and non-conflictual relationship with her mother in which she
gave her mother assistance, including assistance in business affairs and
conduct of the household and personal care when ill.  The
plaintiff was
repeatedly in need of assistance herself.  The plaintiff had family
responsibilities to other people, her husband and
her daughter, which also
claimed her attention.  
<P>

59  	By contrast Daniel Birt showed close loyalty to his mother,
obtained appropriate training for a farming career, pursued other
studies, and
obtained employment from time to time, but when Joan Birt embarked herself and
him on the Hurlstone project, he gave
it all appropriate attention, formed a
household with his mother, gave his time to rural work on Hurlstone and
provided much of the
labour there.  His claims for provision out of her Estate
and Notional Estate are strong and the testatrix recognised them.  In my
judgment it is appropriate that the provision for him should be much greater
than the provision for the plaintiff, but his claims
are not so strong as to
exclude the plaintiff's claims altogether.  I have taken into consideration the
matters set out in subs.9(3)
as appears in these reasons.
<P>

60  	The only other person referred to in evidence who may be an
eligible person is the testatrix' former husband, who has not made
a claim, and
his interests are to be disregarded.  See subs.20(1).
<P>

61  	I turn to the provisions which relate to Notional Estate.  In my
finding the testatrix entered into two prescribed transactions
within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.22.</a>  One was the disposition of her beneficial and legal joint
interest in Hurlstone to Daniel Birt.  This disposition was effected by
a
series of events; the contract by which she purported to sell her interest to
Daniel Birt, the Memorandum of Transfer recording
a consideration of $120,000,
and the pre-concerted acknowledgments which established that payment of
$120,000 was not in fact to
take place.  This disposition was in substance a
gift; in my view it was effective in Equity and was perfected by the change of
legal
ownership which took place by survivorship on her death, and further
confirmed with the transfer of registered proprietorship which
took soon
afterwards.  The disposition is a prescribed transaction within subs.22(1) and
also within paragraph 22(3)(b).  No valuable
consideration was given for it.
The payment to Daniel Birt of $87,501.98 out of the partnership bank account
was also a prescribed
transaction within subs.22(1) and no valuable
consideration was given for it.  
<P>

62  	Upon these facts the Court has power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> to make an order
designating as Notional Estate of the testatrix any property held by Daniel
Birt.
<P>

63  	In terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.26</a>, each of the dispositions disadvantaged the
Estate of the testatrix.
<P>

64  	I turn to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.27.</a>  I have considered the matters referred to in
subs. 27(1).  The defendant has long had reasonable expectations of becoming
the owner
of Hurlstone, but in my view the importance of his expectations is
outweighed by the need to make modest provision for the plaintiff
and by
consideration of the other benefits which have passed to Daniel Birt and have
either been expended or are now in his hands
in a form less traceable than his
ownership of Hurlstone.  In my view the designation of Hurlstone as Notional
Estate accords with
the substantial justice and merits involved.  I have had
regard to the matters referred to in subs. 27(2), as appears from these
reasons.
<P>

65  	I turn to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.28.</a>  The assets in the Estate have not been
maintained in a separate and identifiable form but have been incorporated and
used in the
defendant's affairs, as he has been entitled to do.  No money is
now readily available.  The assets which actually form part of the
Estate of
the testatrix are not now in a form in which they are sufficient to meet the
provision now ordered.
<P>

66  	I have not yet considered the costs of the proceedings and will
deal with them separately when the parties have had an opportunity
to consider
these reasons and bring forward any special matters requiring consideration in
relation to costs.
<P>
