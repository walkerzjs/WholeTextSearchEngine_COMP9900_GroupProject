<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Appeals against a costs assessors decision)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  Both parties have appealed the decision of costs
assessor Leonard S Hattersley dated 29 April 1999.  By summons filed 25 May
1999
Ms Caballero seeks leave to appeal the decision of the costs assessor
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208A</a> (1)(b) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (as
amended) (the Act).  By summons filed 24 August 1999, Andrew Fegent &amp;
Company seeks firstly, that leave to appeal
out of time be granted and
secondly, leave to appeal the certificate as to determination of costs.  
<P>

2  	Ms Caballero sought an adjournment on the morning of the hearing
which was refused (see separate judgment).  Mr Fegent a solicitor
(the former
solicitor) acted for Ms Caballero in a personal injury matter until his
instructions were terminated and another solicitor
took over carriage of the
matter.  It is the former solicitor's costs and disbursements incurred in the
personal injury matter which
are the subject of the bill of costs that was
assessed.  Mr Ramrakha appeared on behalf of Ms Caballero as a solicitor and
amicus
curie.  He submitted that Ms Caballero was seeking leave to appeal
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M</a> of the Act not <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208A(1)(b)</a> as indicated in the summons.
The Ms Caballero relied on her affidavit sworn 3 August 1999.  There are no
annexures attached to that
affidavit.  The former solicitors Andrew Fegent
&amp; Company relied on the affidavits of Daniel Meneghello sworn 17 September
1999
and 20 August 1999.
<P>

<b><u>Mr Fegent's application for an extension of time to appeal</u></b>
<P>

3  	The court has a wide discretion when considering whether or not
to extend time to appeal.  The ultimate test is to do justice
between the
parties.  As a general rule, time will be extended if there is no prejudice to
the other party and appropriate orders
for costs or the imposition of other
terms of the extension adequately protect their position.
<P>

4  	The costs assessor gave no reasons for his decision on 29 April
1999 and it would appear that he was not asked for the - see
<b><u>Attorney
General for New South Wales v Kennedy Miller Television Pty Limited</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 729.</a>  The summons was not filed until 24 August 1999, about
three months out of time.  No explanation was given for the delay.
Accordingly,
Mr Fegent's application for an extension of time to appeal is
refused.  If I am wrong in this, I turn to consider whether leave to
appeal
should be granted.
<P>

<b><u>Applications for leave to appeal by both Mr Fegent and </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Ms Caballero</u></b>
<P>

5  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> of the Act provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in
accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of the
Court to
appeal to the Court against the determination of the application made by a
costs assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A party to an application relating to costs payable as a result of an
order made by a court or a tribunal may, in accordance with
the rules of the
court or tribunal, seek leave of the court or tribunal to appeal to the court
or tribunal against the determination
of the application made by a costs
assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Supreme Court or court or tribunal may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine the
appeal.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or
evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the
original proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

6  	In seeking to appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M</a> the applicant requires
material, other than, or in addition to, a point of law in order to be
successful.  This section provides
that such an application requires leave in
accordance with the rules of the court.
<P>

7  	I have read Master Greenwood's decision in <b><u>Busuttil v
Holder &amp; Anor</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 9 August 1996).  In particular I
agree with his comments on the applicable test for leave.  He says:
<P>

<b>"Thus whilst each application for leave to appeal is to be determined on its
merits and I heed the statement of the High Court in
Adam P Brown Male Fashions
Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 170</a> that it is "unnecessary and
unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria" for the grant of leave to
appeal, as the circumstances
of different cases are "infinitely various"" I can
see nothing in what is before me that leads me to a conclusion that I ought to
look to the question of leave other than to apply the criteria of an obvious
error on the face of the record and substantial injustice
done to the plaintiff
if the determination of the costs assessor is allowed to stand."  </b>
<P>

8  	Neither party put the costs assessor's reasons for his decision
in evidence.  Mr Fegent complained that the costs assessor disallowed
a
considerable number of items (totaling $3,836) which the costs assessor found
principally related to legal services performed in
the conduct of proceedings
under the <b>Workers Compensation Act</b> and in respect of which no recovery
is permitted from the defendant in the personal injury matter.  Mr Fegent
submitted that the
costs assessor erred in his reasoning and that he was
entitled to charge for perusal of medical reports, correspondence, statements
and other work done to do with previous workers compensation proceedings in
furtherance of the common law proceedings.   Mr Fegent
also complained that the
costs assessor reduced profit costs in the sum of $2,657 by reducing charges
rates for an employed solicitors
from $250 per hour to $160 per hour and
paralegal rates from $150 per hour to $70 per hour.  Mr Fegent says that the
costs assessor
did not pay due regard to the experience level of the employed
solicitor engaged on the file or the skill and experience level of
the
paralegal also working on the file.
<P>

9  	Mr Fegent does not dispute disbursements as allowed by the costs
assessor in his certificate of determination of costs, nor
items 1 to 53 in the
bill of costs.  Mr Fegent says that from the date of taking instructions on 7
July 1995 to the date instructions
were terminated on or about 1 May 1997, he
undertook all reasonable and necessary steps to prepare Ms Cabarello's case for
hearing.
 Ms Cabarello complains that her former solicitor filed an incorrect
statement of claim, arranged a medical appointment when she
was not available,
did not prepare the matter for hearing properly, and charge for items that were
not referrable to the common law
proceedings.  The Court of Appeal in
<b><u>Larsen v Vile</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/397.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 397</a> has recently considered whether
the costs assessor erred in attributing costs to workers compensation
proceedings or common law proceedings.
 
<P>

10  	The bill of costs sought that Ms Cabarello pay Mr Fegent the sum
of $24,803.74.  This sum was reduced by the costs assessor
to $15,427.80.
Without the costs assessor's reasons it is difficult to discern whether the
costs assessor has erred.  It is my view
that there is no obvious error on the
fact of the record nor will there be substantial injustice done to either party
if the determination
of the costs assessor is allowed to stand.  Ms Cabarello
and Mr Fegent's applications for leave to appeal are refused.  The costs
assessor's determination of 29 April 1999 is affirmed.  The summonses are
dismissed.  Each party is to pay his/her own costs.
<P>

11  	The order I make in proceedings 12087/99 is:
<P>

(1)	Mr Fegent's application for an extension of time to lodge an appeal is
refused.
<P>

12  	In both matters:
<P>

(2)	The application for leave to appeal is refused.
<P>

(3)	The decision of the costs assessor of 29 April 1999 is affirmed.
<P>

(4)	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(5)	Each party is to pay his/her own costs.
