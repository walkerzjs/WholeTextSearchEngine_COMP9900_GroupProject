EINSTEIN J

<b>55041/91  </b>Australian Development Corporation Pty Limited v White
Constructions (ACT) Pty Limited and Ors.    
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT </b>   Monday 8 February 1999
<P>

<b>	Background</b>
<P>

1	It is now some sixteen or seventeen years since the National Capital
Development Commission invited the submission of designs
for the development of
a site in Canberra involving a three-storey office building and a twenty-storey
residential building with
underground car parking beneath and adjacent to the
buildings which became known as the `Quadrant project' (`the project').  It is
almost twelve years since the execution of a written agreement (`the
contract'), under which White Constructions (ACT) Pty Limited
(`ACT') agreed to
design and construct the project for Australian Development Corporation Pty
Limited (`ADC') for a price of $19,535,000.00.
 ACT was a wholly owned
subsidiary of White Constructions Limited (`WCL') which was in turn a wholly
owned subsidiary of White Industries
Limited, now known as Exxon Coal Australia
Limited (`WIL' or `Exxon').
<P>

2	In taking the Court through the background history, Mr Gyles QC appearing for
ADC, pointed out that `the lengthy negotiations
which had taken place between
the White Group on the one hand and ADC on the other hand for the construction
of the complex . . .
were conducted on the part of the White Group by officers
of WIL, [that] it was officers of WIL who had done the estimating internally
which was the foundation for those negotiations and [that] ADC had been
negotiating with others . . . as well'.
<P>

3	During the intervening period, there has been much litigation in relation to
the contract.  These proceedings were commenced in
1991.  In July 1992 there
were referred to the Honourable D.A. Yeldham QC for enquiry and report, a
number of questions in the proceedings.
<P>

4	The report brought down was dated 19 April 1993.  The report then came before
Giles CJ Comm. Div. pursuant to Part 72 Rule 13
of the Rules.
<P>

5	Eight questions had been before Mr Yeldham.  The referee's opinion on
Question 4A was, in summary form as follows:
<P>

	<i>`WIL represented that it and ACT or one of them could do the work required
by the contract for the price stipulated therein utilising
a steel frame for
the residential building and ADC relied on the representation in contracting
with ACT.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[See summary set out in the judgment of Giles CJ Comm. Div. 14.10.93 at
page 2]
<P>

6	In his judgment delivered on 14 October 1993, Giles J adopted the report in
relation to some of the questions, rejected it in
relation to others, and
arrived at different answers to the latter questions.  A number of ADC's causes
of action then fell away,
but ADC amended to include claims against WCL for
damages for inducing breach of contract, ACT's intermediate holding company.

<P>

7	Relevantly the judgment of Giles J of 14 October 1993 stated:
<P>

	<i>`Question 4A</i>
<P>

<i>	Originally both the residential and the office buildings in the project
were to be of concrete.  In the course of the negotiations
structural steel
frames were introduced.  A fax dated 28 January 1987 from Mr Amann, an
estimator employed by WIL, on the letterhead
of WIL recorded a "Revised Final
Offer" which included a figure of $2,542,000 for structural steel for columns
and beams in both
the residential and the office buildings, and included the
words, "The structure will be constructed of structural steel columns
and beams
. . .".  Mr Fischer of ADC said that he formed an understanding that the
residential building and the office building would
be constructed of structural
steel columns and beams, and that he had a conversation with Mr Amann to the
effect (para 17 of Mr Fischer's
statement) -</i>
<P>

<i>	"I said:</i>
<P>

<i>	`I have studied steel framed buildings and I cannot understand how you can
make it viable.  We have designed and were planning to
build the MBF building
in Bathurst Street, Sydney and we went through the whole question of concrete
versus steel.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Amann said:</i>
<P>

<i>	`That is not your worry.'</i>
<P>

<i>	I said:</i>
<P>

<i>	`What about the details?  How will you deal with the underside of balconies
and fire proofing for example?'</i>
<P>

<i>	Amann said:</i>
<P>

<i>	`Don't you worry about it, it is all included in the price.  We know what
we are doing.'"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Amann denied this conversation, but the referee accepted that it took
place.  The referee said -</i>
<P>

<i>	"I prefer the version of Mr Fischer to that of Amann, as a matter of
probability, and I am of the opinion that Amann as an employee
of WIL (he was
not employed by ACT) did inform Fischer that the project could be carried out
(whether by WIL or ACT does not matter)
for the price submitted on 28 January
to the design contained in the draft specification of that date, including the
use of structural
steel frame to the residential component which it had
introduced as a cost saving.  I accept also the claim in paragraph 20 of Mr
Fischer's statement (Exhibit 5) that had he not received the assurances that
the project could be completed using steel frame for
the agreed price he would
not have signed the contract, evidence which was corroborated by him when he
was permitted to be recalled
during the course of addresses . . . .  I do not
think that it is an answer to say, as was submitted by senior counsel of WIL,
that
the only reliance was upon the contractual provisions and not upon any
statement concerning the use of steel."</i>
<P>

<i>	After referring to another conversation which the referee regarded as
corroborative of Mr Fischer's concern that the work required
by the contract
could be performed for the price stipulated utilising a steel frame for the
residential building, the referee said-</i>
<P>

<i>	"I answer question 4A by saying that, as is claimed in paragraph 15 of the
amended Summons, WIL by its servant, Amann, did make a
statement to Mr Fischer
concerning a steel frame for the residential building in terms set out in
paragraph 17 of Mr Fischer's statement
(Exhibit 5).  I find also that some
reliance was placed upon the statement by the plaintiff.  In this respect it
should be borne
in mind that, as Wilson J said in Gould v Vaggelas  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=157%20CLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">157 CLR 215</a>
at page 236, the representation need not be the sole inducement for a course of
action.  It is sufficient so long as it plays some
part, even if only a minor
part."</i>
<P>

<i>	There is a touch of obscurity in this.  Paragraph 15 of the summons alleged
a representation that the work required by the contract
could be done for the
price stipulated therein utilising a steel frame for the residential building.
On one view the referee answered
question 4A by finding that Mr Amman said what
Mr Fischer attributed to him, without saying whether Mr Amman's words amounted
to
the representation alleged.  But the words "as is claimed in paragraph 15"
and the passage from the report earlier set out show that
the referee meant
that Mr Amann's words amounted to the representation alleged, and before me it
was taken that he took this second
step.  I have reflected that in my summary
of the referee's opinions at the beginning of these reasons.</i>
<P>

<i>	WIL's primary submission was that all that Mr Amann told Mr Fischer was
that the question of whether or not a steel framed building
could be built for
the price stated was a matter for the builder, and that there was "no
representation in any relevant sense". 
It pointed out that the contract was a
fixed price contract whereby any cost overruns would be to the account of the
builder and
contained a provision that the parties thereto would not be bound
by any external representations, and said that all that could have
been
represented was that the builder would comply with its contractual
obligations.</i>
<P>

<i>	Perhaps that would be so if the conversation ended with the words, "That is
not your worry".  But Mr Amann said more, and it is not
simply a question of
whether a promise to do something connotes a present ability to do it (cf
Futuretronics International Pty Ltd
v Gadzhis  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ATPR%2041%2d049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ATPR 41-049).</a>
</i><cite>In the conversation accepted by the referee he conveyed by the words
"it is all included in the price" that the work required by the
contract,
relevantly so far as a steel frame was intended for the residential building
fell within the quoted price, and by the following
words "We know what we are
doing" that the price was appropriate for the performance of the work so
required.  In a commercial context,
it would not be thought that the builder
was quoting a price insufficient to carry out the work and shouldering a loss,
and what
Mr Amann said would reasonably have been understood as representing
that the price was a price which would cover the cost of doing
the work.  From
the referee's findings, clearly it was understood as an assurance that the
contract was "viable" (Mr Fischer's opening
query to Mr Amann) notwithstanding
the use of a steel frame.</cite><i>  In my opinion the referee was correct in
finding in the conversation between Mr Amann and Mr Fischer the representation
addressed
in the question.</i>
<P>

<i>	WIL's further submission was that the report should not be adopted so far
as the referee held that ADC relied on the representation
as distinct from the
contractual provisions in entering into the contract.  It said that in this
respect the referee's opinion was
at odds with his opinion that WIL did not
represent that it would be responsible for the performance of ACT's obligations
under the
contract, and that it followed from the latter opinion that ADC
relied on its rights under the contract with ACT as the perceived
contracting
party rather than upon what was said by Mr Amann.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is no inconsistency between reliance upon the representation the
subject of the question and the absence of, or of reliance
on, a quite
different representation.  Even if ADC did not rely on WIL holding out that it
would be responsible for ACT's performance
of the contract, it could well have
relied upon the representation the subject of the question.  Further, the
referee specifically
accepted Mr Fischer's evidence that had he not received
the assurances that the project could be completed for the agreed price using
a
steel frame he would not have signed the contract.  That is a finding of fact
the adoption of which was not contested, and WIL's
submission overlooks the
distinction between reliance in entering into a contract and reliance upon the
rights under a contract once
entered into.  I consider that the report should
be adopted in relation to question 4A.</i>
<P>

<i>	The referee was careful to point out that what this might lead to in the
proceedings was not a matter for his opinion.  It may be
that it does not avail
ADC.  That must be left for the future.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[judgment pages 25 to 29]  [emphasis added]
<P>

8	Mr Gyles submitted that these findings could not be `rolled back' by anything
which later occurred.  Mr Gyles submitted that WIL
had been attempting to
subvert the referee's finding on this issue by a series of manoeuvres.
<P>

9	It is relevant to note the terms of paragraphs 15 to 17 inclusive of ADC's
amended Summons dated 3 February 1993 :
<P>

	<i>`15.	Further or in the alternative, the defendants represented that the
defendants or one of them could do the work required by the
contract for the
price stipulated therein utilising a steel frame for the residential
building.</i>
<P>

<i>	PARTICULARS</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	See the facsimile of 23 January 1987 to the plaintiff from Robert Amman
on behalf of the second defendant and the letter to the
plaintiff of 28
January1987 signed on behalf of the second defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	In or about January/February 1987 prior to the contract, Mr. Amman, on
behalf of the second defendant, orally told this to representatives
of the
plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	16.	In reliance on each of the said representations the plaintiff entered
into the agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>	17.	The said representations were false or misleading, further or in the
alternative misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead
or deceive in that
respectively:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the second defendant is not responsible or does not accept
responsibility to the plaintiff for the defaults of the first defendant
under
the agreement;</i>
<P>

<i>	(aa)	At the time of the said representation and at the time of the
agreement the second defendant intended to cease construction
work, transfer
existing construction work to and undertake further construction work through
White Constructions Limited with a view
to a public flotation or outright sale
of the shares in the capital yet made no disclosure to the plaintiff of all or
any of the
foregoing.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the defendants and neither of them could do the work required by the
Agreement for the price stipulated therein by utilising
a steel frame for the
residential building;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ba)	The second defendant had no reasonable grounds for making the
representations.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the fact that the first defendant was licensed was not the only reason
for naming it as the contracting party.'</i>
<P>

10	In a document dated 2 December 1994 the parties agreed upon the issues
remaining in the proceedings and that there should be
a hearing to determine
those issues other than the amount of any damages to which ADC or ACT might be
entitled with the amount of
any damages to be the subject of an order for
reference if liability were established.  There then followed a hearing before
Giles
J. 
<P>

11	The judgment of Giles J was handed down on 30 January 1996 and is reported
in Volume 12, <i>Building and Construction Law</i>, page 317 and covers some 60
pages.  Pages 365 to 376 of the judgment are appended for convenience to this
judgment.  The third last
sentence reads:
<P>

	<i>`More litigation is necessary to determine whether WIL is liable to ADC and
if so for what amount.'</i>
<P>

12	On 16 May 1997, Giles J referred to Mr J.A. Morrisey for enquiry and report
`the balance of the proceedings'.  Mr Morrisey's
report was in turn brought
down on 1 June 1998.
<P>

	<b>The Notices of Motion before the Court</b>
<P>

13	There is presently before the Court an amended notice of motion filed by ADC
on 7 December 1998 seeking orders:
<P>

	(a)	as against the first defendant:
<P>

	(i)	that the report be adopted;
<P>

<i>	</i>(ii)	that there be judgment for the plaintiff against the first
defendant in the sum of $33,593,268 plus interest thereon to date
of
judgment;
<P>

	(iii)	that the first defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff's claim against
it;
<P>

	(b)	as against the second defendant:
<P>

	(i)	that those parts of the referee's report identified in the schedule, be
adopted;
<P>

<i>	</i>(ii)	that the report otherwise be rejected;
<P>

	(c)	in the alternative seeking as against the second defendant:
<P>

	(i)	that the Court reject the findings of the referee that:
<P>

	(a)	if the plaintiff had not entered into the contract which it did with the
first defendant as a result of the second defendant's
contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, the plaintiff would have entered into a similar
contract with the first defendant (but utilising a concrete frame instead of a
steel
frame for the residential tower) for approximately the same price, which
would have been just as `non-viable';
<P>

	(b)	in those circumstances, the plaintiff suffered no loss as a consequence of
the second defendant's contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a>;
<P>

	(ii)	that the Court decide the remaining issues on the evidence taken before
the referee;
<P>

	(d)	as against both defendants:
<P>

	(i)	that the defendants pay the costs of the motion;
<P>

	(ii)	for such further or other orders as to the Court may seem appropriate.
<P>

14	The notice of motion sought only relief against ACT and WIL, WCL having been
earlier dismissed from the proceedings.
<P>

15	There is also before the Court a notice of motion filed on 19 June 1998 by
WIL in which it seeks an order that the Court adopt
so much of the referee's
report as was delivered by the referee and that the balance of the proceedings
be referred to him for enquiry
and report as relates to the dispute between the
plaintiff and WIL.  That notice of motion also seeks an order that ADC pay
WIL's
costs of the reference and of the application.
<P>

16	Mr Rayment submitted in the alternative as follows:
<P>

	(a)	That the Court should adopt the referee's report.
<P>

	(b)	That the Court should ask some questions of the referee with a view to
later adoption of the report, if appropriate.
<P>

	(c)	That the Court should both adopt the report as well as refer the matter
back to the referee for determination of issues not
yet determined, but
suggested as convenient to be determined inter alia, against the event that the
proceedings come before the Court
of Appeal which may set aside the referee's
decision of no loss or damage, including:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	The limitation or time bar issues.
<P>

	(ii)	The quantification of the actual cost of construction of the building in
concrete.
<P>

17	I deal with the parties further submissions on relief below.
<P>

18	ACT did not appear.  ADC was represented by Mr Gyles QC and Mr Liney of
counsel.  WIL was represented by Mr Rayment QC and Mr
Goldstein  of counsel.
<P>

	<b>The Principles which Inform the Court's Discretion in Respect of a
Referee's Report</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>The parties were at one in accepting that the principles which inform
the Court's discretion whether and to what extent to adopt,
vary or reject the
referee's report are as set out in <i>Super Pty Ltd v SJP Formwork (Australia)
Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 549.</a>
<P>

19	The Court's discretion to adopt, vary or reject the referee's report is not
constrained in the same way that challenges to arbitral
awards are constrained.
As <i>Super</i> makes plain, grounds for rejecting a report may include:
<P>

	(a)	an error of principle;
<P>

	(b)	a patent misapprehension of the evidence;
<P>

	(c)	perversity or manifest unreasonableness in fact finding.
<P>

20	<i>Super</i> also makes plain that where a complaint about a report involves
a question of law, or the application of legal standards to the facts,
a proper
exercise of the discretion requires a judge to consider and determine that
matter afresh.
<P>

21	ADC opposed the adoption of the report on the basis of :
<P>

	(a)	suggested errors of principle, involving questions of law or the
application of legal principles to the facts; 
<P>

	(b)	a suggested patent misapprehension of the evidence and perverse or
manifest unreasonableness in fact finding.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Judgments of Giles J of 30 January 1996 and 29 April 1997</b>
<P>

22	It will be necessary from time to time in this judgment to refer to the
judgment delivered by Giles J on 30 January 1996, to
which I have already
referred.  Giles J himself referred to that judgment when his Honour later had
to deal with whether the remaining
issues should be the subject of an order for
reference.  In a judgment dealing with that question, handed down on 29 April
1997,
Giles J said of his reasons, delivered on 30 January 1996, as follows:
<P>

	<i>`In reasons delivered on 30 January 1996 I held that ADC was entitled to
damages from ACT for breach of contract but was not entitled
to damages from
WCL and that ACT was not entitled to damages from ADC.  The position as between
ADC and Exxon was more complicated.
 ADC claimed against Exxon for
contravention of the Act, alleging that misleading or deceptive conduct on the
part of Exxon caused
it to enter into the contract and that it thereby suffered
loss of [sic] damage.  The misleading or deceptive conduct causing entry
into
the contract was established.  I did not feel able to reach a definite
conclusion as to the occasioning of loss or damage, and
in particular when any
loss or damage was suffered (which was important to whether ADC commenced
action within three years of the
accrual of its cause of action), until ADC's
case for the amount of its damages was put forward.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[judgment of 29 April 1997 at page 2]
<P>

23	In the same judgment of 29 April 1997, Giles J identified what his Honour
referred to as `the remaining issues' as follows:
<P>

	(a)	As between ADC and ACT, the amount of damages to which ADC is entitled for
breach of contract;  and
<P>

	(b)	as between ADC and Exxon, whether ADC's entry into the contract occasioned
loss or damage, and if so when the damage was suffered
and the amount of
damages.
<P>

24	Also in this judgment Giles J in dealing with the question of evidence
exchanged to that point in time going to the remaining
issues and the fact that
the evidence was of an expert or technical nature, said as follows:
<P>

	<i>`The unforeseen complication is that it is still necessary to determine for
the purposes of the remaining issues what ADC would have
done had there not
been the misleading or deceptive conduct and when any loss or damage occasioned
to it was suffered, questions
which are linked and to an extent go beyond the
expert or technical questions otherwise to be determined.  That also is common
ground,
although the extent is seen differently by ADC and Exxon.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[judgment at pages 3-4]
<P>

	<b>The Holdings which Bound the Referee</b>
<P>

25	Before continuing with the chronology and turning to the submissions of the
parties, it is convenient to return to the holdings
which bound the referee, Mr
Morrisey.  The holdings were:
<P>

	<i>(1)	`. . . that WIL represented that it and ADC or one of them could do the
work required by the contract for the price stipulated
therein utilising a
steel frame for the residential building'</i>.  [Adoption by Giles J on 14
October 1993 of the report of Yeldham J in relation to question 4A;  Giles J,
30 January 1996 at page
365].
<P>

	<i>(2)	That ADC placed some reliance upon the representation in entering into
the contract. </i> [Adoption by Giles J on 14 October 1993 of the report of
Yeldham J in relation to question 4A;  Giles J, 30 January 1996 especially
pages 365-369]
<P>

	[It is important to note here that the referee, Mr Morrisey, was bound by:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Yeldham's findings as to reliance which involved Mr Yeldham's
acceptance of Mr Fischer's evidence, in its full terms - "had
I not received
the assurances that the project would be completed using steel frame for the
agreed price, I would not have agreed
to sign the contract".
<P>

	(b)	Giles J's findings as to the effect of the representation upon Mr
Fischer's signature of the contract - see Giles J judgment,
30 January 1996 at
pages 368-369]
<P>

<i>	(3)	That the representation was untrue in that on a proper assessment the
work required by the contract could not be done for the
price. </i> [Giles J,
30 January 1996 at page 368]
<P>

	<i>(4)	That:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	In context, the making of the representation was misleading or
deceptive conduct or conduct likely to mislead or deceive in contravention
of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of the </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a><i> and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	if ADC's entry into the contract occasioned loss or damage, that loss
or damage was suffered by the contravention.</i>
<P>

<i>		</i>[Giles J, 30 January 1996 at page 369]
<P>

26	It is pertinent to note, as Mr Rayment reminded the Court in submission,
that there was no finding binding on the referee to
the effect that there had
been an implied representation from the giving of the quoted price that WIL had
checked it and found it
to be viable.  Mr Rayment's submission was that it was
doubtful in the extreme that it would be necessary to take a builder who quoted
a price as thereby implicitly representing that it found the quoted price to be
viable.  In support of this proposition, Mr Rayment
submitted that a builder
may have a number of motives, such as for example a need for continuity of
work, for giving a particular
price to a proprietor.  Mr Rayment submitted that
the only implicit representation in such a situation might well be that the
builder
had done his or her best to work out what the price was and bona fide
believed in the price as a matter of opinion.  These were not,
however, matters
for debate on the notices of motion before the Court.
<P>

<b>	The Order for Reference to Mr Morrisey</b>
<P>

27	It is common ground that following the judgment of Giles J of 30 January
1996 and the further judgment of 29 April 1997, the
proceedings were stood over
for the parties to agree upon a referee and frame an order for reference.  It
is common ground that Mr
Morrisey had referred to him by orders of the Court
made on 16 May 1997 for enquiry and report `the balance of the proceedings'.
It is common ground that at a conference held on 2 June 1997, the parties
agreed a statement of issues as follows:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	as between ADC and ACT, the amount of damages to which ADC is entitled
for breach of contract;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	as between ADC and WIL, whether ADC's entry into the contract with ACT
occasioned loss or damage and if so, when the damage was
suffered and the
amount of damages.</i>
<P>

<i>	If the damage in (b) was suffered earlier than 9 August 1988, whether ADC's
cause of action under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 82(1)</a> of the </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a><i> is barred
by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 82(2)".</a></i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[See pages 1-2 of the referee's report of 1 June 1999]
<P>

28	The referee was then required to determine whether ADC's entry into the
contract with ACT as a result of the misrepresentation
by WIL as to the
viability of the contract, occasioned loss or damage, and if so how much, for
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 82</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i>.
<P>

[Plaintiff's overview submissions paragraph 3]
<P>

	<b>The Referee's Report</b>
<P>

29	The referee's report of 1 June 1998 covers some 108 pages.  The report was
closely examined before me as was the January 1996
judgment of Giles J in the
reported form.  Again and as a matter of convenience, I append pages 74 to 84
of the report to the judgment.
<P>

	<b>Suggested Uncontradicted Evidence of Mr Huntstead</b>
<P>

30	I note immediately Mr Gyles' submission that on the evidence, Mr Amman, a
senior estimator with WIL, was not a decision maker
for WIL, whereas Mr
Huntstead, who was Mr Amman's superior and gave evidence before the referee,
had been responsible for recommending
the offer to be submitted by ADC to the
directors.  Mr Gyles submitted that there was simply no basis on which the
referee could
have made a finding [see page 74 of the report] that WIL would
have put forward a price equating to the price which was bid in relation
to
concrete.  The submission was that the referee in fact edited out so much of
ADC's written submissions as had dealt with Mr Huntstead's
evidence.  The
matter is dealt with in paragraphs 119 and following below.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>ADC's Submissions</b>
<P>

31	ADC claimed before the referee that its loss consisted of:
<P>

	(a)	the actual construction cost it incurred as a result of its entry into the
contract with ACT ($37.9m net of PC), less what
would have been a reasonable
contract price for the work ($18.6m net of PC), being a net claim of $19.3m;
<P>

	(b)	consequential costs consisting of $9.2m additional financing charges on
the above expenditure.
<P>

	[Plaintiff's overview submissions of 3 December 1998 before me - referring to

<P>

	<b>ADC's Submissions as to the Correct Legal Principle</b>
<P>

32	ADC submitted before me that its claim was in accordance with correct legal
principle.  The submission was that a plaintiff who
has been induced by a
misrepresentation to enter into a contract, whether for property or services,
is entitled to recover as damages
the amount he or she actually paid as a
result of so doing (including consequential costs);  less the true or fair
value of what
he or she received, which in the present case was said by the
plaintiff to be equivalent to a fair and reasonable contract price
for the
work.  The plaintiff's submission was that this represents the disadvantage
that such a plaintiff suffered, less the value
he received, and restores the
plaintiff to the position as if the wrong had not occurred.
<P>

33	ADC sought to rely inter alia, on <i>Spencer, Bower and Turner</i>
`Actionable Misrepresentation', 3rd edition paragraphs 203, 206 and 208.
Paragraph 203 reads as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Damages</i>
<P>

<i>	203.  In an action of deceit, or its equitable equivalent, the relief to
which a successful plaintiff is entitled is damages, and
damages only.  There
can be no question of undoing any contract or transaction, since the action is
instituted and maintained on
the basis that the representee has elected, or is
compelled by the application of certain rules of law, to adhere to such
contract
or transaction;  from which it follows that he can be put back in the
position in which he was before he altered it on the faith
of the fraudulent
misrepresentation (which is the purpose of all civil relief) only by the
recovery of a gross sum in money, which
is to compensate him (so far as money
can) for the loss which he has suffered down to the date of trial, and also for
such loss (if
any) as he must necessarily suffer in the future under the
provisions of the contract which he is fixed with, or otherwise.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Paragraphs 206 and 208 are set out in paragraph 92 of this Judgment.
<P>

34	Reliance was also placed upon <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, 15th edition at
page 1096 where the proposition put under the heading `Fraudulent
Misrepresentation : Deceit' reads `The normal
measure of damages is the value
transferred less the value received, whether of property or of services'.
<P>

35	ADC's submission was that the objective of the award of damages in tort is
to place the plaintiff in the position he or she would
have been in absent the
tort, that is, if left alone;  in the present case, as ADC puts it, `if no
representation had been made'.
<P>

36	ADC's submission was that if a plaintiff is induced to enter into a
transaction which it would not otherwise have entered, then
the objective of
the award of damages is achieved if the plaintiff recovers all that he or she
outlaid (subject to any break in the
chain of causation by true supervening
events for example), but must give credit for value received as a result of the
transaction.
<P>

37	On ADC's submissions, if it is necessary to explain the matter by way of
comparison of position, the comparative is simply not
entering the transaction
and so becoming liable to make the outlay's.  On ADC's submission, the Court
does not go further and ask
what else would have been done with the money.
<P>

38	ADC's submission was that such investigation as might take place of a
hypothetical character is usually on the issue of reliance
or inducement;  in
cases where there has been no transaction and, for example, the loss of an
opportunity is claimed;  or where the
plaintiff is seeking some extra `loss of
expectation' - type damages in the case of a misrepresentation leading to a
transaction
(for example <i>Collings Construction Co Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v

<P>

39	ADC submitted that even where a `hypothetical' is indulged in, little if any
weight is attached to ex-post facto statements and
in this regard cites Finn J
in <i>Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Air Services Australia</i> 9
December 1997, Unreported, Federal Court of Australia.  [Butterworths Cases
970710 at page 4]
<P>

40	ADC submitted that Giles J had found that the misleading conduct had caused
ADC to enter into the contract.  On ADC's submission,
the only question for the
referee was what loss this occasioned to ADC.  On ADC's submissions, the
contentions of WIL which the referee
had accepted in the reported pages 78-83,
were `a thinly disguised collateral attack upon his Honour's judgment'.
<P>

41	ADC submitted that the referee's approach did not accord with principle.
ADC's submission before me in this regard was, inter
alia as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Instead [of following an approach which accorded with principle] he
`found' a hypothetical alternative scenario wherein ADC, instead
of being
misled into the non-viable ACT contract by the misrepresentation as to its
viability, entered into another contract, also
with ACT, which was also
underpriced by WIL/ACT, and which would therefore have been equally non-viable
and therefore would have
carried the same adverse financial consequences for
ADC.  On the basis of this hypothetical alternative scenario, he `found' that
ADC therefore suffered no loss as a result of its actual entry into the
contract with ACT, since the hypothetical loss neutralised
the actual loss
(report page 84)'.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[ADC's overview submissions, 3 December 1998 at paragraph 7.]
<P>

42	ADC then submitted that the referee's approach is unsupported by any
authority and entirely begs the task of assessing ADC's
actual loss flowing
from its entry into the contract in reliance on WIL's misrepresentation, in
accordance with the principles which
ADC submitted obtained.
<P>

43	ADC's submission was that the referee's approach on this subject, was
entirely misguided, and as such, his report on this subject
should be
rejected.
<P>

	<b>ADC's Alternative Submission that the Referee in Any Event Misapplied `the
Second Stage Comparison'</b>
<P>

44	ADC then submitted that even if the referee's approach had been correct in
principle, it was wrong in execution.  The submission
was that if it was
necessary to go to a second stage comparison, this is done on an objective and
not a subjective basis.  On ADC's
submissions, the question here would be as to
what would a properly informed, reasonable and honest principal and builder
agree in
relation to the project.  ADC's submission is that the answer must be
a contract for a reasonable price which would yield the identical
result, on
ADC's submissions, to the Court simply ensuring that the plaintiff recovered
all that it outlaid but give credit for value
received as a result of the
transaction.  [See the plaintiff's earlier submissions set out above].
<P>

45	ADC submits that its argument is `even more compelling when it is
appreciated that the gist of the misrepresentation here was
that the building
could be built for the quoted price by the builder concerned, that is, that the
contract was viable, particularly
when the misrepresentation is by a
substantial parent in relation to a subsidiary'.
<P>

46	ADC submits that again, if it is necessary to go to the second stage
comparison, an alternative approach is to ask what contract
would have been
entered into between ADC and ACT, assuming that both parties were acting
honestly and reasonably and were fully informed.
 On ADC's submission, the same
result must follow, namely a contract at a reasonable price.
<P>

47	Here, ADC submits that the Court simply will not assume that reasonable,
honest and properly informed parties would enter into
a contract at a gross
undervalue.  On ADC's submission, even if this would be assumed, it could only
work to the advantage of the
plaintiff, as the set-off would be less and the
verdict greater.  On ADC's submission, in no circumstances could the Court
assume
that the hypothetical contract would be broken by the builder, for that
would be to reward a party for its own wrong.
<P>

48	In relation to the same topic, ADC notes that in <i>Mihalis Angelos</i>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1970/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] EWCA Civ 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%201%20QB%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 1 QB 164</a>, Edmond Davies LJ said at 202-203:
<P>

	<i>`The assumption has to be made that, had there been no anticipatory breach,
the defendant would have performed his legal obligation
and no more.'</i>
<P>

49	In short, even if the referee's approach had been correct in principle,
ADC's submission is that it was wrong in execution for
the reasons that:
<P>

	(a)	Even if hypothesising what would have happened had ADC not been misled
into the contract with ACT which was non-viable and
improperly performed, the
referee should not have hypothesised entry into a different contract with ACT
which was equally non-viable
and improperly performed.  On the contrary, the
referee should have hypothesised that the alternative contract would have been
properly
priced and properly performed.
<P>

	(b)	In finding that if ACT had proffered an alternative contract price, it
would have been equally underpriced and non-viable,
the referee misconceived
the evidence, which was not to that effect at all.
<P>

	(c)	The referee's hypothetical approach involved hypotheses which were legally
irrelevant on any view.  The submission is that
the referee not only asked
`what would have happened if the wrong had occurred', but also `what would have
happened if, additionally,
matters antecedent to the wrong had not
occurred'.
<P>

	<b>ADC's Submissions as to No Admissible Evidence or No Sufficient Admissible
Evidence</b>
<P>

50	ADC further submits that in any event, there was either no admissible
evidence or no sufficient admissible evidence upon which
the referee could have
found that WIL would have consciously permitted its subsidiary to enter into a
hypothetical alternative contract
at a gross undervalue or that ACT would have
breached the hypothetical contract with the same consequences as found in
relation to
the actual contract.  In this regard, ADC's submission is that the
referee's hypothetical finding involved, in relation to key elements:
<P>

	(i)	internally contradictory findings;
<P>

	(ii)	misapprehension of the evidence of Mr Fischer;
<P>

	(iii)	failure to deal with arguable points.
<P>

	<b>Suggested Internal Contradictory Findings</b>
<P>

51	ADC's submissions in relation to suggested internally contradictory finding
were as follows:
<P>

	<i>'25.	WIL's submissions adopted by the referee included the submission that
an alternative contract with ACT was highly likely if not
inevitable because
ever since 1985 the parties had been negotiating toward a contract for concrete
which only became steel at the
last moment:  report pp 82.1, 82.4.  (In fact,
ACT was only introduced as an entity in 1987;  such negotiations as there were
in
1985 and 1986 were with WIL.)  Linked with this is the submission (and
finding) that:  "This is a case where the plaintiff cannot
correctly say that
but for the breach of s52 no contract at all would have been entered into with
ACT"  (report p 82.2).</i>
<P>

<i>	26.	The referee's finding in accordance with the WIL submissions on these
points directly contradicts his own independent finding
earlier in the report.
At page 46 after a lengthy recitation of the pre-contract history, the referee
there concluded:  first, that
in truth there was not really a course of 18
months of negotiations between the parties;  and second, this was a case where
absent
the misrepresentation there would have been `no transaction' between the
parties (adopting the language used in Kenny &amp; Good
v MGICA  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20147%20ALR%20568" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 147 ALR
568</a> - see the referee's recitation of the competing submissions at pp 6 and
7).</i>
<P>

<i>	27.	The referee clearly accepted ADC's Written Submission in Reply
(paragraph 125) that on a proper view of the pre-contract history
there was no
sense of inevitability about a contract with Whites and that until Mr Fischer
had his doubts, there was simply no reason
for ADC to look elsewhere.</i>
<P>

<i>	28.	The earlier, independent conclusion of the referee should be preferred.
His later adoption of the WIL submissions is inconsistent
and cannot
stand.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Plaintiff's written submissions dated 9 July 1998 paras 25-28]
<P>

	<b>Suggested Misapprehension of Mr Fischer's Evidence</b>
<P>

52	ADC's submission in relation to the suggested misapprehension by the referee
of the evidence of Mr Fischer were as follows:
<P>

	<i>'29.	Next, the WIL submissions adopted by the referee included the
submission that ADC (Mr Fischer) would not have sought (or not
relied on) an
assurance from WIL concerning a hypothetical new price in concrete (report p
80). . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	30.	That submission and finding misstated Mr Fischer's evidence in
rejecting it as improbable.</i>
<P>

<i>	31.	In support of the conclusion at the foot of page 80, Mr Fischer is said
to have given implausible evidence to the effect that,
if WIL had come back
with a price in concrete following rejection of its steel price, he would have
been reassured by a statement
that "we know what we are doing" and "it's all in
the price".  That was not his evidence.  The evidence referred to is set out in
the report at pages 59-60.  Two contexts must be distinguished.  One is the
actual context in which the actual misrepresentation
was made;  the other is
the hypothetical context in which assurance might, hypothetically, have been
sought and given.  The evidence
at pages 59-60 deals with the
</i><cite>hypothetical</cite><i> context.  Mr Fischer says only that he would
have sought a "full assurance" from WIL, and, if he was assured then that would
satisfy
him.  He does not say what, in this hypothetical context, he would have
required by way of assurance - perhaps he would have required
a detailed
breakdown of costs.  At pages 65-6, Mr Fischer is simply reciting the
</i><cite>actual</cite><i> misrepresentation (in terms which have been
conclusively found in his favour earlier in the proceedings).  The references
to "it's
all in the price" and "we know what we're doing" belong only in the
context of the actual misrepresentation.  On the hypothesis that
Mr Fischer had
not relied on such statements to enter into the contract for steel, it can
certainly not be assumed that he would
have been reassured by such statements
to enter into a contract for concrete (or even that such statements would have
been made).</i>
<P>

<i>	32.	Thus, the WIL submissions and the referee's findings have conflated two
different areas of evidence, and rejected the conflated
version as
improbable.</i>
<P>

<i>	33.	The referee's (implicit) rejection of Mr Fischer's evidence that he
would have only proceeded to contract with ACT for concrete
if he had obtained
appropriate assurances from WIL, is unsound and should be rejected.</i>
<P>

<i>	34.	Next, the WIL submissions, adopted by the referee, include the
submission (p 82.5) that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Mr Fischer did not have any concern about price except in the context
of a steel frame;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	even then, he said, whether </i><cite>ACT</cite><i> would be able to do
the job for the price was a marginal consideration to him because he was to
have the benefit of a lump sum contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	Thus (goes the submission and finding) it is improbable that Mr Fischer
would have sought or required assurance from WIL before proceeding
to contract
with ACT for concrete instead of steel.</i>
<P>

<i>	35.	The submission (and finding) misstates the evidence in a material
way.</i>
<P>

<i>	36.	As to 34(a):  It was steel that first triggered the question whether
WIL knew what it was doing, and whether the contract was
properly priced and
viable:  see the evidence at report pages 64.5 and 58.5.  But that is not to
say that, once those concerns had
arisen, they would have disappeared if steel
disappeared.  On the contrary, once the questions had arisen, they would have
remained
(and perhaps intensified) if WIL had changed from steel to concrete:
see the evidence at report pages 59.7 and 60.4.  Thus there
is no basis for the
finding that Mr Fischer had no concern about price except in the context of a
steel frame.</i>
<P>

<i>	37.	As to 34(b):  Mr Fischer's evidence was in fact that, if
</i><cite>WIL</cite><i> had (after abandoning steel) given a price in concrete,
</i><cite>with a good reason</cite><i> why it was no longer proceeding with
steel, he would have accepted it, </i><cite>because it was WIL and not
ACT</cite><i>:  see the evidence at report pp 68.5-70.2.  This does not weaken
Mr Fischer's evidence that he would have sought assurance from WIL,
but rather
reinforces it.  Thus the rejection of Mr Fischer's evidence that he would have
required assurance from WIL, is unsound
and should be rejected.'</i>
<P>

	<b>Suggested Failure to Deal with Arguable Points</b>
<P>

53	ADC's submissions in relation to the suggestion that the referee failed to
deal with arguable points were as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Next, the WIL submissions (adopted by the referee) included a submission
that ADC had time imperatives which made a hypothetical
alternative contract
with ACT most likely (report p 78.9).</i>
<P>

<i>	39.	The referee failed to consider or deal with the evidence and
submissions of ADC to the contrary, to the effect that ADC had no
real fears of
suffering forfeiture so as to affect its decision:  Written Submissions
paragraph 77 and evidence there referred to.</i>
<P>

<i>	40.	If that evidence and submission is to be taken as having been rejected,
the process of reasoning has not been revealed.</i>
<P>

<i>	41.	Next, the WIL submissions, adopted by the referee, included the
submission that ADC had budgetary constraints such that it would
not have been
willing or able to countenance prices for concrete that were properly assessed
and viable (report p 79).</i>
<P>

<i>	42.	The referee failed to consider or deal with the evidence and submission
of ADC to the contrary, and to the effect that ADC was
well able and prepared
to accept an alternative concrete price of the order of $22-23M:  Written
Submissions, paragraphs 78, 79,
Written Submissions in Reply paragraph 128, and
the evidence there referred to.</i>
<P>

<i>	43.	If that evidence and submission are to be taken as having been
rejected, the process of reasoning is not disclosed.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Plaintiff's written submissions dated 9 July 1998 paras 38-43]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>ADC's Attack on the referee's Finding of the Hypothetical
Alternative Scenario</b>
<P>

54	It is plainly necessary to treat with each of ADC's submissions very
carefully.  To my mind a convenient starting point involves
the first of ADC's
submissions before me which attacked the referee's finding of the hypothetical
alternative scenario.
<P>

	<b>The Threshold Question</b>
<P>

55	A threshold question is raised by WIL here.  WIL submits that an important
consideration on the respective applications before
me, concerns the approach
taken before the referee by ADC.  WIL submits that ADC's case throughout the
reference involved the proposition
that if ACT had entered into a contract for
the construction of the building with a concrete frame and if the price had
been similar
to the price in the actual contract entered into in February 1987,
then the contract would have met the same kind of non-performance
by ACT as
actually occurred in the case.  WIL submit that so much of the plaintiff's case
was undisputed by Exxon and that indeed,
that was also part of the case of
Exxon.
<P>

56	WIL submits that in contradistinction to the submissions as to principle put
by Mr Gyles for ADC before me, ADC conducted the
whole of its case before the
referee upon the basis that the hypothetical did require to be considered.
Here, WIL cite ADC's written
statement of findings for which it contended
before the referee.  Those written findings were referred to before the referee
at page
18 of the transcript.  In those written submissions, ADC put its claims
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`3.	If ADC had not contracted with ACT, it would probably have contracted
with another builder for substantially the same work but
with a concrete frame
instead of the steel frame recommended by WIL.  The alternative builder would
probably have been one of the
earlier (1985) tenderers, with tender prices
updated to allow for escalation but also for certain cost reductions introduced
by group
architects' modifications to the Dysart Scheme.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	The contract price with the alternative builder would probably have been
of the order of either:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	$24m - $26m (based on updating the 1985 tenders);  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	$21m - $23m (based on quantity surveyors' estimates of the reasonable
cost of construction in concrete in early 1987).</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	Whichever approach is adopted in determining the probable alternative
contract price, it would have been a price which made ample
allowance for the
cost of the work and for profit, so as to remove the disincentive for diligence
and completion which affected the
ACT contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	The alternative contract would probably have been a lump sum contract
(with provision for adjustment for variations), with a fixed
date for practical
completion (with provision for extension for certain types of delay) and with
provision for liquidated damages.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.	It is </i><cite>not probable</cite><i> that such alternative contract
would have been beset by the delays, lack of diligence, unreasonable
provocation of industrial dispute,
breaches of contract and ultimate necessity
for termination that beset the ACT contract.  On the contrary, the alternative
builder
would, having regard to the matters in 5 and 6 above, have had every
incentive to proceed with all due diligence to timely completion,
including by
avoiding or settling industrial disputes.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.	Pursuant to the alternative contract, the works would probably have been
completed for an amount of an order of $21 - $26m (see
4 above), by about April
1989 (the extended date for practical completion under the ACT
contract).</i>
<P>

<i>	9.	Instead, as a result of contracting with ACT, ADC:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	suffered the delays, lack of diligence, unreasonable provocation of
industrial dispute, breaches of contract and termination
that have been found
against ACT;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	incurred the costs of having the project completed by others (without
the security of a lump sum, fixed date contract) and</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	incurred the costs of financing the project through to its delayed
completion date of 21August 1992.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[emphasis added]
<P>

57	Hence, WIL submitted that both ADC and WIL had before the referee, been
content to and in fact confined their cases to the very
hypothetical which ADC
now, as a matter of principle, seeks to suggest was misconceived.  Mr Rayment
for WIL, who appeared during
the reference, contended that the question of
principle which Mr Gyles sought to raise before me, had simply never been
alluded to
or put to the referee, but that to the contrary, ADC positively
sought before the referee to prove that if it had not contracted
with ACT, it
would probably have contracted with another builder for substantially the same
work, however, using a concrete frame
instead of the steel frame recommended by
WIL.  
<P>

58	On Mr Rayment's submissions, ADC having failed dismally before the referee
on the relevant question of fact, albeit that it imported
a hypothetical
element, now seeks to have the Court when the report is sought to be adopted by
WIL, reject the report in a fashion
which the Court ought not condone.  In
short, Mr Rayment submits that it is simply not open at this point in time in
these proceedings,
bearing in mind the manner in which ADC was content to
conduct the litigation before the referee and to proffer issues before the
referee, for ADC to now do a complete turnabout when it has failed on the only
question squarely placed for determination before
the referee.  Mr Rayment's
submission is that even if, which he does not accept, the principles now prayed
in aid by ADC before me
be correct, so that the hypothetical alternative ought
not as a matter of principle to have been considered by the referee, this
is
not a matter which is now open to be contended for by ADC.  Mr Rayment submits
that the Court has a discretion and ought exercise
that discretion, by denying
to ADC any entitlement to challenge the referee's decision on a fundamental
matter never argued before
the referee.
<P>

59	Even if it were now open to ADC to attack the referee's approach as a matter
of principle, I have come to the view that Mr Gyles'
submissions on this
question should be rejected.  Hence it is unnecessary for me to deal with the
so-called threshold question.
<P>

	<b>The Question of Principle</b>
<P>

60	In my view, a number of decisions of the High Court of Australia have
clearly laid down the necessity in proceedings where an
applicant claims relief
under Section 82 or Section 87 that the applicant establish what the applicant
has lost, or in the case of
Section 87, is likely to lose.  The referee's
statement (at pages 3 to 5 of the report) of the principles applicable for
determining
whether ADC's entry into the contract with ACT occasioned loss or
damage, and if so, as to the amount of such loss or damage, was
generally
accurate.
<P>

61	As Gauldron J put the matter in <i>Marks v GIO</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=158%20ALR%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">158 ALR 333</a> [paragraphs
19 and 20] at 340:
<P>

	<i>`There being nothing in the Act to suggest otherwise, it is for an
applicant for relief under s.82 or s.87 to establish what he or
she has lost
or, in the case of s.87, what he or she is likely to lose.  In a case such as
the present, if an applicant can establish
that, but for the misleading and
deceptive conduct, he or should would have entered into a contract that would
have returned the
very benefit that was represented, damages will be the same
as if the representation had been contractual.  That was the situation
in
Collings Construction Co Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20131" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 131.</a>  In that situation, however, "it is for the
[applicant] to establish that he could and would have entered into [that other]
contract".</i>
<P>

<i>	Moreover there may be cases where an applicant establishes that, but for
the contravention of s.52 of the Act, he or she would not
have entered into the
contract in question or into any other contract or arrangement of that kind.
It is possible - although not
inevitable - that, in that situation also, the
loss will be the same in money terms as it would have been if the
representation were
contractual.'</i>
<P>

62	In the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in <i>Marks</i> at
paragraph 39, their Honours in referring to <i>Gates v City Mutual Life
Assurance Society</i> (1986) 160 CLR 1, said as follows:
<P>

	<i>`In that case the appellant claimed that he had been misled by a
misrepresentation about the circumstances in which benefits would
be payable
under a total disability clause which he had added to his existing
superannuation policy issued by the respondent.  In
fact, the clause provided
for payment of benefits only where the appellant was incapable of attending to
any gainful occupation;
 he had been told it would apply if he could not attend
to his occupation.  It was found that "but for the statements, Mr Gates would
have proceeded exactly as he did save that he would not have paid extra for
total disability cover".'</i>
<P>

63	In short, as their Honours point out, the finding in <i>Gates</i> was not
dissimilar from the referee's finding in the present proceedings.
<P>

64	Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ in <i>Gates</i>, said inter alia at 13:
<P>

	<i>`Because the object of damages in tort is to place the plaintiff in the
position in which he would have been but for the commission
of the tort,
</i><cite>it is necessary to determine what the plaintiff would have done had
he not relied on the representation.  If that reliance has deprived
him of the
opportunity of entering into a different contract for the purchase of goods on
which he would have made a profit then
he may recover that profit on the
footing that it is part of the loss which he has suffered in consequence of
altering his position
under the inducement of the representation</cite><i>.
This may well be so if the plaintiff can establish that he could and would have
entered into the different contract and that it
would have yielded the benefit
claimed . . .  The lost benefit is referable to opportunities foregone by
reason of reliance on the
misrepresentation.  In this respect the measure of
damages in tort begins to resemble the expectation element in the measure of
damages
in contract save that it is for the plaintiff to establish that he
could and would have entered into the different contract.</i>
<P>

<i>	So in the present case if the appellant were able to establish that but for
his reliance on Mr Rainbird's representation, he could
and would have entered
into policies of insurance containing a disability clause of the kind
represented by Mr Rainbird, he might
then succeed in obtaining an award of
damages equal to the benefits which would have been payable under such policies
less the premiums
paid or payable in respect of them.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	Unfortunately for the appellant the evidence does not support this basis
for an award of damages.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

65	The referee was, in my view, entirely correct in approaching the question of
determining whether ADC's entry into the contract
occasioned loss or damage by
examining whether ADC could establish that but for the misleading and deceptive
conduct of WIL, ADC
would have entered into some other, and if so, what,
contract for building the project or would have acted in some other, and if
so
what, way.  In short, the referee was required to determine what ADC would have
done had it not relied on the representation.
 Subject to the matters sought to
be put by ADC impugning the report dealt with in the later sections of this
Judgment, the referee
in fact, did determine what ADC would have done had it
not relied on the representation.  ADC was obliged to present a case for an
award of any loss it claimed to have suffered by reason of the misleading and
deceptive conduct of WIL.  The enquiry into the hypothetical
scenario here
engaged in by the referee was entirely appropriate and accorded with
principle.

66	I do not see the passages quoted from <i>Spencer, Bower and Turner</i> or
<i>McGregor</i> <i>on Damages </i>as requiring any different conclusion.
<P>

	<b>The Suggested Constraint on the Hypothetical Comparison - `A Wrongdoer
cannot be assumed to put forward a hypothetical involving his
own
wrongdoing'</b>
<P>

67	Mr Gyles submitted that even if the hypothetical comparison was required to
be carried out by the referee, he was not entitled
to assume that the
hypothetical contract would be broken by the builder for, so Mr Gyles put it,
that would be to reward a party
for its own wrong.
<P>

68	In short form, Mr Gyles summarised his argument as involving the following
propositions:
<P>

	(1)	Once a contract is entered into as a result of a misrepresentation, the
plaintiff receives back all that the plaintiff outlaid
so as to put itself in
the position it was in before the representation was made, but giving credit
for all that it has retained.
 In this case, that was said to be construction
costs plus holding charges minus the value or a reasonable price.
<P>

	(2)	One can compare the contract which was entered into with a contract which
might have been entered into.  That, as it were,
hypothetical contract, is one
which the Court must assume was at a reasonable price and hence one must arrive
at the same result,
whether or not one is looking at the hypothetical parties
or the actual parties.
<P>

	(3)	If it is appropriate to enter into the hypothetical arena, which ADC
submits it is not, on ADC's submission, that arena is
entered into upon the
assumption that persons do not enter into contracts for gross undervalue but
rather at reasonable prices. 
Hence, ADC submits that the Court must assume
that a hypothetical contract will be kept and not broken.
<P>

	(4)	In any event, on ADC's submission, there was no proper basis for the
referee to find that WIL would have consciously permitted
a gross
undervalue.
<P>

	(5)	The Court must assume reasonableness in the parties.
<P>

	(6)	The Court must assume that contracts are kept.
<P>

69	In my view, these submissions simply throw up the importance in each case of
a close examination of all the facts.  The suggested
principles (5) and (6)
have an obvious attraction, but depending on the precise issues which are live
in a particular case, the way
in which the principles are applied may well
differ.  Issues concerning implied terms are for example, obvious candidates
for the
application of such principles.  But here the issue is as to whether
and if so to what extent, the tribunal in examining the hypothetical
scenario,
is to be necessarily inhibited from carrying out a full and unfettered
examination of what position as a matter of fact,
an applicant would have been
in, but for the occurrence of the misleading and deceptive conduct.
<P>

70	I note also that there is and always has been here a distinction between the
two corporate entities, namely ACT and WIL.
<P>

71	Prior to the reference to Mr Morrisey, much attention had been given
initially by Mr Yeldham QC and then by Giles J to the precise
content of the
misrepresentation held in fact to have been made by WIL in about January 1987.
This was a representation in the real
world.  The representation was found
following evidence having been given initially before Mr Yeldham QC and later
before Giles J.
 The real world representation was that WIL represented in
about January 1987 that it and ACT or one of them could do the work required
by
the contract for the price stipulated therein using a steel frame for the
building.  The finding was also that ADC relied upon
the representation in
entering into the contract with ADC.
<P>

72	It seems to me important to note that the context in which the
representation was held to have been made is explained by Giles
J both in his
judgment of 14 October 1993 and in the reported judgment, as one in which Mr
Fischer's concern was with endeavouring
to understand how Whites could make a
steel framed building viable.  The crucial part of the discussion between Mr
Fischer and Mr
Amann referred to by Giles J in the extract from his judgment of
14 October 1993 above set out, involved that topic.  It was in relation
to that
topic that Mr Fischer asked the question to which Mr Amann responded:  "That is
not your worry".  It was after that answer
that Mr Fischer had given evidence
that he had said:  "What about the details?  How will you deal with the
underside of balconies
and fire-proofing for example" and that Mr Amann had
said:  "Don't you worry about it, it is all included in the price.  We know
what we are doing".
<P>

73	As Giles J points out in his judgment of 14 October 1993, WIL's primary
submission to Giles J had been that all that Mr Amann
told Mr Fischer was that
the question of whether or not a steel framed building could be built for the
price stated was a matter
for the builder, and that there was "no
representation in any relevant sense".  WIL, as Giles J made plain, had pointed
out that
the contract was a fixed price contract whereby any cost over-run
would be to the account of the builder and contained a provision
that the
parties thereto would not be bound by any external representations, and said
that all that could have been represented was
that the builder would comply
with its contractual obligations.
<P>

74	Giles J in the judgment of 14 October 1993 had answered this submission in
the words "perhaps that would be so if the conversation
ended with the words,
that is not your worry, but Mr Amann said more . . .".
<P>

75	There was no finding by Giles J in his judgment of 14 October 1993 or in the
reported judgment, of any conversation between Mr
Amann and Mr Fischer in which
steel had not been part of the equation and in which Mr Fischer had given
evidence that he was concerned
with a White quotation to build in concrete.
<P>

76	In the result, the only representation which grounded the requirement for
the reference to Mr Morrisey was that dealt with by
Giles J in the judgment of
14 October 1993 and in the reported judgment.  Hence, in the real world, Mr
Fischer's evidence was accepted,
namely "Had I not received the assurances that
the project would be completed using steel frame for the agreed price, I would
not
have agreed to sign the contract".  [reported judgment at page 368,
right-hand column]
<P>

77	The crucial point, as it seems to me to bear in mind, is that both the terms
of the reference to Mr Morrisey, as well as the
applicable principles of law
regulating the matters to be investigated by Mr Morrisey, effectively required
Mr Morrisey to engage
in the hypothetical world of endeavouring to bring down a
finding as to what loss, if any, ADC had suffered by the representation
which
had been found.  In that hypothetical world, Mr Morrisey was to determine a
question of fact.  The question was one which arose
between ADC and WIL.  The
question was whether ADC's entry into the contract with ACT occasioned loss or
damage (and the further
question if damage had been occasioned, as to when the
damage was suffered and the amount of damages).
<P>

78	The referee went about the exercise by endeavouring, on the evidence adduced
before him, to discern and make a finding as to
what would have occurred but
for the contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> of the Act.
<P>

79	In that regard, the referee was perfectly entitled, on the evidence, to
accept, as he did, Mr Fischer's evidence that it was
only the concept of
building in steel which engaged his concern - see referee's report page 83.
<P>

80	The referee was likewise entitled to accept WIL's submission, that `there
were no representations which [Mr Fischer] needed to
obtain if the price
suggested was in the region of $20m and the method of construction proposed
were in concrete', and to take into
account that Mr Fischer had said that the
mere fact that the other tenders were for a greater amount by more than $3m
gave him no
cause for concern - see report page 83.
<P>

81	It cannot be contended that the referee did not examine the question of
whether the hypothetical scenario which he found would
have necessarily
involved an act of legal wrongdoing by WIL.  That this question was examined
appears from the agreement with and
adoption by the referee of WIL's
submissions put in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>(a)	"Still less should one accept the ADC suggestion that Exxon would have
been guilty of some other breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.52</a> in the event that it had put forward a
price to build the residential tower in concrete".</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[report page 82]
<P>

	<i>(b)	"Counsel for ADC submitted in opening - that the only way that ADC
could have been enticed to enter into a contract for the construction
of the
residential tower in concrete for $20 million would have been by ACT (a
typographic error for WIL - see Transcript before
the referee at page 58)
making similar or misleading representations to ADC.  He in effect submits that
we would then have been back
here anyway, presumably after Whites had performed
in the same way under a contract to build in concrete".  </i>[report page
83]
<P>

	[I interpolate to note the importance of the whole of the last full paragraph
on page 83 of the report of which the passage set
out in (b) above forms a part
only.  The paragraph goes on to note that WIL agreed with ADC's submission in
part only.  What WIL
stated (and the referee accepted) was that<i> "if the
contract had been entered into for the construction of the residential tower in
concrete at about $20 million, the contract
would have produced similar
difficulties for the White Group, and there is no reason to believe that
subsequent events would have
been different so far as the behaviour of Whites
is concerned.  The contract would have been . . ." grossly under priced,
because
it too, on the better evidence, would not have covered the costs of
doing the work, and couldn't have been viable".</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The part of ADC's submissions with which WIL disagreed (the referee
again accepting WIL's submissions) was the submission that the
only way that
ADC could have been enticed into entering the concrete construction contract
for $20 million involved WIL making similar
misleading or deceptive
representations to ADC.  Hence the referee agreed with, accepted and adopted
WIL's responsive submission
that<i> "Mr Fischer's evidence was that it was only
the concept of building in steel which engaged his concern.  </i><cite>There
were no representations which he needed to obtain if the price suggested was in
the region of $20 million and the method of
construction proposed were in
concrete</cite><u>"</u>.  [emphasis added]]
<P>

82	Nor can it be contended that the referee did not examine the question of
fact as to whether ACT would not have carried out the
contract to construct in
concrete.  
<P>

- See the referee's acceptance and adoption of WIL's submission that <i>`there
is no reason to believe that subsequent events would have been different as far
as the behaviour of Whites was concerned'</i>.  [report page 83]
<P>

- See also the referee's acceptance and adoption of WIL's submission that
<i>`If ADC had entered into a contract with ACT for the construction of the
residential tower in concrete, for a closely similar price,
it is likely that
the same problems would have arisen as did arise'</i>.  [report page 82] 
<P>

 
<P>

And note the referee's acceptance and adoption of WIL's submission on report
page 83 which expressly adverted to the need to weigh
the evidence by using the
words `the better evidence'<i> - "The contract would have been . . . `grossly
underpriced, because it too, </i><cite>on the better evidence</cite><i>, would
not have covered the costs of doing the work and wouldn't have been
viable'</i>."
<P>

83	Mr Gyles sought to submit that:
<P>

	(1)	a finding is to be found in the reported judgment of Giles J, namely that
Mr Fischer's interest was in obtaining a contract
which was viable;
<P>

	(2)	the suggested finding was binding upon the referee;
<P>

	(3)	the referee departed from the suggested finding.
<P>

84	I do not see this submission as of substance.  Giles J did not deal with the
hypothetical world but left determination of the
relevant question to Mr
Morrisey who was then faced with the task of examining what would have occurred
had the contract which was
in fact entered into, not been entered into.  He
carried out that exercise on the evidence and he found that if the breach of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of <i>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> held to have taken place had not
occurred, on the balance of probabilities, ADC would have entered into a
similar contract with ACT
for the construction of the residential tower in
concrete for about the same price.
<P>

85	Mr Gyles' submissions which seek to rely upon the wrongdoer principle, fail
at a threshold level because there was no necessity
imposed by any principle of
law that Mr Morrisey's decision carry with it or be predicated upon, legal
wrongdoing of any type by
WIL.  The referee, in examining the hypothetical
question posed, could have found that but for its reliance on the
misrepresentation,
ADC would have entered into the contract with ACT for
construction of the project in concrete, but that such a contract would only
have been entered into by ADC by reason of some form of legal wrongdoing for
which WIL would have been liable.  He made no such finding.
 
<P>

86	Nor did it follow from the fact that WIL had been found to have made a
misrepresentation in breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of the Act at a time when the steel
construction had been the subject of discussion between Mr Fischer and Mr
Amann, that where one
assumes that no such misrepresentation had taken place at
all, Mr Fischer would not have been prepared to proceed with ACT in entering
into a contract involving concrete unless WIL was prepared to give an assurance
that such contract price was viable.
<P>

87	Hence, when Mr Gyles submits that it did not lie in WIL's mouth to assert
before the referee that the hypothetical would have
involved a non-viable
contract between its ultimate subsidiary ACT and ADC, or submits that the
referee was not entitled to and ought
not to have held that the hypothetical
would have involved a non-viable contract, the submission fails at a factual
level.  The referee
in fact found that the contract would have been underpriced
and non-viable, but did not find facts which involved some form of legal
wrongdoing by WIL.  The referee expressly rejected ADC's submissions that Exxon
would have been guilty of legal wrongdoing comprised
of some other breach of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> in the event that it had put forward a price to build the residential
tower in concrete.  This plainly involved a decision on a question
of fact
before the referee.
<P>

88	Nor do I accept that the referee's finding miscarried because he was obliged
by some principle of law to assume that the hypothetical
contract for
construction in concrete would be kept and not broken.  To my mind that also
simply raised a question of fact to be
decided on the evidence.
<P>

89	ADC relies upon the maxim<i> `nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua
propria'</i> - `no man can take advantage of his own wrong'.
<P>

[Cf. <i>Broom's Legal Maxims,</i> 10th edition, Pakistan Law House, 1939 at 191
et seq.,  noting that this maxim, being `based on elementary principles, is
fully recognised
in Courts of law and equity, and indeed, admits of
illustration from every branch of legal procedure'.]
<P>

90	The principle and its application to several areas of law has recently been
discussed in the House of Lords by Lord Jauncey of
Tullichettle in
<i>Alghussein Establishment v Eton College </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20WLR%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 WLR 587</a>, with who's
reasons Lord Bridge, Lord Elwyn-Jones, Lord Ackner and Lord Goff agreed.  There
the principle was expressed as providing
`that a contracting party will not in
normal circumstances be entitled to take advantage of his own breach as against
the other party'
(at page 591).
<P>

91	The principle is applicable to `various and dissimilar circumstances'  [per
Broome at page 195].  In particular, the maxim may
apply<i>:</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(a)	as a principle of construction. For example, a party to a contract
who is bound by a condition may not take advantage of his or
her own breach to
annul the contract - <i>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v Societe et des Ateliers
et Chantiers de France</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1919%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1919] AC 1</a> per Viscount Reading CJ at 723-4;
<i>Cheall v APEX</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20All%20ER%201130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 All ER 1130</a>, H.L.(E.) per Lord Diplock at 188-9;
<i>Alghussein Establishment v Eton College </i>per Lord Jauncey of
Tullichettle. Likewise, in relation to construction of statutes, the
legislature will be presumed, in the absence
of some indication to the
contrary, not to have intended that wrongdoers should benefit from their
wrongdoing.  See<i> Grozier v Tate</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2016%20LGR%2057" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 16 LGR 57</a> per Owen J at 61;<i>
Allen v Bega Valley Council </i>(Unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 22 December
1994)
<P>

	(b)	as a principle of law. For instances in which a wrongdoer may not rely on
his or her wrongdoing, see -<i> Twycross v Grant</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%202%20CPD%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) 2 CPD 469</a>;<i>
Twyne's Case</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=3%20Rep%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">3 Rep. 80.</a> Similarly, A will have no action in trespass
against B, who lawfully enters to abate a nuisance caused by A's wrongful act
-<i> Perry v Fitzhowe</i> 8 QB 757.
<P>

An analogous principle which finds application under this maxim, is the law
relating to the "forfeiture rule" [which extends to
rights deriving their
existence from statute, for instance, to prevent a person who has murdered
another from claiming as the beneficiary
or next of kin of the deceased].  See
<i>Sinanian v EKS Carpentry Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of
NSW, 5 Sept 1997, Mason P, Beazley JA, Grove AJA) per Mason P at 6. The purpose
and justification for
this rule was stated in <i>Yango Pastoral Co Pty Ltd v
First Chicago Australia Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20139%20CLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 139 CLR 410</a> as being to 'discourage
breaking the law' (per Mason J at 427-8; Jacobs J at 432-3).'
<P>

92	Difficult hypothetical problems of application of the principle may be
encountered, for example, in cases involving principles
of assessment in deceit
cases or in other cases of legal wrongdoing.  Paragraphs 206 and 208 of
<i>Spencer Bower and Turner</i>, `The Law of Actionable Misrepresentation' 3rd
edition, Butterworths, state inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Principles of assessment - II: Where fraud has induced contract</i>
<P>

<i>	206.	It is where the representee's alteration of position has assumed the
form of a contract with the representor, or with a third
person, and where
usually there are two sides to the account, and a balance has to be struck,
that nice questions as to the quantification
of damages have generally arisen.
But the rules applicable may now be said to be established.  On one side of the
account must be
placed everything that the representee has paid, and the proved
value of everything he is compellable to pay in the future, including
the value
(to be assessed) of any property or advantages, estimable in money, which he
has transferred, or is compellable to transfer
in the future, pursuant to the
terms of the contract.  On the other side is to be placed all money, or the
value of all property
which he has received, or is entitled in the future to
receive (here again the present value is to be estimated), under the same
contract.  If the real value of the items on the credit side of the account is
nil, which has not infrequently been found to be the
case, the representee is
entitled to the whole amount of the items on the other side, which is "the
ultimate, final, highest standard
of his loss".</i>
<P>

<i>	On the other hand, if the credit items are a complete equivalent, he has
sustained no damage at all.</i>
<P>

<i>	208.	. . . It is now well settled that the value of any property or rights
or benefits received by the representee means their real
or actual value, to be
determined by reference to the evidence adduced, and without reference to
current or market prices in the
case of marketable securities, where such
prices are wholly artificial, and the mere manufacture and creation of the very
company
or persons whose fraud has given the representee his right to damages;
or, in other words, "value" means the price which the shares
or other property
would have fetched as between reasonable and honest sellers and purchasers, if
the whole truth of the facts which
the representors had perverted or concealed
had been within the knowledge of those fixing the price.</i>
<P>

93	In <i>Twycross v Grant</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1877%5d%202%20CPD%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1877] 2 CPD 469</a> an action had been brought by
the plaintiff under the <i>Companies Act</i> 1867 to recover the amount paid by
him on certain shares taken by him in the Lisbon Steam Tramways Company Ltd on
the ground of the
fraud of the defendants, who had been promoters of the
company, in omitting from the prospectus two contracts entered into by them
as
promoters (one a contract between defendants Clark, Punchard and another, for
the purchase of certain foreign concessions for
the construction of tramways
which the company was afterwards incorporated to make and work; the other, a
contract between the defendants
Clark, Punchard and Grant, as to certain
payments to be made by Clark and Punchard to Grant, in consideration of his
obtaining for
them a contract from the company for the construction of the
tramways), by means of which fraud the plaintiff had been induced to
take the
shares, which proved worthless.  The jury had found that these contracts were
material to be made known to the intended
shareholders of the company.
<P>

94	At the trial, the judge directed the jury that if the real damage occasioned
to the plaintiff by the defendants' fraud was the
price he paid for the shares,
then he was entitled to recover that amount.  The jury then assessed the
damages at the price paid
by the plaintiff.
<P>

95	On appeal, the judgment of the Court (Lord Coleridge, CJ., and Grove and
Lindley JJ) delivered by Lord Coleridge included the
following:
<P>

	<i>`With respect to the damages, we think the verdict ought not to be
disturbed.  The principle we apprehend to be that the plaintiff
is entitled to
recover whatever damages he has sustained by reason of the fraud of the
defendants.  By the fraud of the defendants
he was induced to pay 700l. for
seventy shares in this company, and the whole of that money has been lost.
That loss was the natural
consequence of the acquisition and retention of
shares in such a company as this.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was indeed contended that 700l. could not be right, as the defendants
were at all events entitled to be credited with the market-price
of the shares
when the plaintiff bought them;  and reference was made, in support of the
defendants' contention on this point, to
Sedgwick on Damages, p. 556, and to
Lord Campbell's observations in Davidson v Tulloch.  No doubt, if the shares
were really worth
anything when bought, the defendants ought to have credit for
what they were really worth.  But the fact that they were quoted at
a premium
on the Stock Exchange is only evidence of value, not proof of it;  and, if the
jury thought (as they well might, and probably
did,) </i><cite>that the
quotation on the Stock Exchange did not shew a real, but only a delusive value
caused by the fraudulent nature of the prospectus
and the mode in which the
shares were manipulated by the defendants and others in concert</cite><i> with
them, </i><cite>the jury were not only justified in disregarding, but were
bound to disregard, such delusive and factitious value;</cite><i>  although, of
course, if the plaintiff had sold his shares, he must have credited the
defendants with whatever he might have realized
by the sale.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is no evidence whatever that the shares ever had any value except
that which resulted from the wrongful acts of the defendants;
 and </i><cite>it
would be contrary to all principle to allow them to take advantage of their own
wrong, and claim credit for the market-price of
the shares, when but for their
own concealment of the contracts in question there is no reason to suppose that
the shares would have
had any market value at all.  The defendants are not
entitled to say to the plaintiff, "You might have sold your shares to some one
as ignorant as yourself, or to some speculator in shares."  The plaintiff was
not bound to sell;  and, after he discovered the fraud,
he could not sell. . .
.</cite>
<P>

<i>	It was further contended that the true measure of damages is, the
difference between the value of what the plaintiff intended to
get and the
value of what he did in fact get.  Adopting this principle, two results were
contended for.  First, it was said that
the plaintiff intended to get shares in
a company such as that described in the prospectus, and he got shares worth
less than they
would have been worth if the concealed contracts had not been
entered into;  and that the utmost measure of damage is, the diminished
value
of the shares consequent on the payment out of the capital of the company of
the sums mentioned in the concealed agreements.
 Secondly, it was argued that
as, according to the plaintiff's own contention, the company's undertaking was
impracticable, the shares
which he really intended to get were worthless, and
that consequently he had sustained no damage at all by reason of the
concealment
of which he complains.  </i><cite>But, in our opinion, the
defendants are not entitled to avail themselves of the fact that the plaintiff
intended to take shares in
such a company as that described in the prospectus,
or in the company unaffected by the concealed contracts.  That intention was
itself the result of the wrongful act of the defendants;  and, as between the
plaintiff and them, he is entitled to repudiate any
intention of his own based
on their fraudulent concealment.</cite><i>  He is entitled to say that, but for
their fraud, he would never have parted with his money.  He has parted with it
for shares as
to which there was abundant evidence that they never had any real
value at all;  and his loss is the direct consequence of the defendants'
conduct in issuing the prospectus.  His slight and temporary profits hardly
equal the ordinary interest of his money;  and we think,
therefore, there is no
reason for disturbing the verdict of the jury either wholly or in part.'</i>

96	I note also that in <i>The</i> <i>Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 64</a>, Deane J at pages 118-119 in considering the burden of proof
relating to assessment of damage, pointed out that in many cases, proof
of the
full extent of the loss or injury sustained would involve establishing an
evidentiary foundation for positive and detailed
ultimate findings by the Court
upon the balance of probabilities in loss of chance situations.  His Honour
continued at pages 118
and 119 saying, inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`There are, however, cases where considerations of justice or the
limitations of curial method render ultimate findings, about what
would have
been or will be, impracticable or inappropriate.  In such cases, damages must
be assessed on some basis other than findings
about what would have ultimately
happened if the repudiation or breach had not occurred or about the precise
ultimate implications
of the situation which exists after the repudiation or
breach . . . If, for example, what the plaintiff has lost by reason of the
defendant's repudiation or breach of contract is a less than 50 per cent but
nonetheless real and valuable chance of winning some
contest or prize, of being
the successful tenderer for some commercial undertaking or of deriving some
other advantage, in circumstances
where a Court can decide that a proportionate
figure precisely or approximately reflects the chance of success but can do no
more
than speculate about whether, but for the defendant's wrongful act, the
plaintiff would have actually won the contest, prize or tender
or derived the
advantage, it would affront justice for the Court to hold that the plaintiff
was entitled to no compensation at all
for the lost chance of competing or
striving or for the wasted expenditure which was incurred in obtaining or
performing the contract.
 In such a case, considerations of justice require
that the plaintiff be entitled to recover the value of the lost chance itself
and that the defendant be not allowed to take advantage of the effects of his
own wrongful act to escape liability by pointing to
the obvious, namely that it
is theoretically more probable than not at a less than 50 per cent chance of
success would have resulted
in failure. . . .'</i>
<P>

97	I do not see any of the propositions established in the above cited
authorities as in the circumstances of the present case,
obliging the referee
by a principle of law to assume that the hypothetical contract for construction
in concrete would be kept and
not broken.  This is simply because before the
maxim can be invoked, it is necessary to find that the particular circumstances
would
involve WIL taking advantage of its own wrong.  The referee failed to
find any facts which albeit in considering the hypothetical,
were facts which
involved some form of legal wrongdoing by WIL.  Hence, on the facts, no
question of WIL taking advantage of its
own legal wrongdoing entered the
equation.
<P>

98	This case is not, it seems to me, one in respect of which the circumstances
are such that, using the above quoted words of Deane
J in <i>Amann</i>,
`considerations of justice or the limitations of curial method render ultimate
findings about what would have been . . . impracticable
or inappropriate'.
Clearly, WIL committed a wrongful act by making the real world misleading and
deceptive misrepresentation in breach
of s.52.  But in assessing what, if any,
loss ADC could prove it suffered by reason of the misleading and deceptive
conduct of WIL,
the referee was not invited by WIL to take into account on the
hypothetical, any factual integer which itself, as for example occurred
in
<i>Twycross</i>, was the result of a wrongful act of WIL.  The point is that
the referee was not obliged as a matter of legal principle, or considerations
of justice, to find that for ACT to have underquoted on the hypothetical
contract for construction in concrete, necessarily had to
involve any form of
legal wrongdoing by WIL.
<P>

99	The curial procedures adopted by the referee in investigating as a matter of
fact:
<P>

	(a)	what contract, if any, ADC would have entered into or how ADC would
otherwise have acted but for WIL's misleading and deceptive
conduct;
<P>

	(b)	with which entity any such contract would have been entered into and for
what form of construction and at what price;
<P>

	(c)	whether such contract would have been entered into with ACT to carry out
the construction for a price which would not have
been viable;
<P>

	(d)	if affirmative to (c), whether in order for such a contract to have been
entered into, WIL would have committed a form of<i> legal wrongdoing;</i>
<P>

were neither impracticable nor inappropriate.
<P>

100	Ultimately, the referee did not find that for ACT to have underquoted on
the hypothetical contract for construction in concrete
necessarily had to, or
would have, involved any form of legal wrongdoing by WIL.
<P>

101	Mr Gyles sought to place some reliance upon <i>TCN Channel 9 v Hayden
Enterprises</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 130</a> where an action for damages had been
brought by the respondent for breach of contract.
<P>

102	The respondent, Hayden Enterprises Pty Ltd (Enterprises), was a company
beneficially owned by Mr Michael Walsh who was its managing
director.
Enterprises, the parent company of the group, employed Mr Walsh, and carried on
the business of providing his services
as radio announcer and television
compere.
<P>

103	Mr Walsh was also the principal of Hayden Productions Pty Ltd (Productions)
which carried on business as a producer of television
programmes.
<P>

104	The contracts in question were each entered into on 15<i> </i>February 1985
between TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd (Channel 9) and Enterprises as to one such
contract, and between Channel 9 and Productions,
as to the second such
contract.  The Enterprises contract provided for Enterprises to make Mr Walsh
available to Channel 9 as a compere
of the Mike Walsh Show for the years 1985
and 1986.  The Productions contract provided for Productions to produce the
Mike Walsh
Show for those years, and also to produce, in association with
Channel 9, a day time programme, the Midday Show, for the years 1985
to
1989.
<P>

105	Channel 9 repudiated its agreement with Enterprises in August 1985.
<P>

106	The Productions Agreement included a clause directed to the position where
the Enterprise Agreement came to an end, in which
event Channel 9 was given an
option to terminate that part of the Productions Agreement which related to the
Mike Walsh Show.  The
critical question concerned the construction of the words
`comes to an end'.  Channel 9 submitted that those words encompassed every
way
in which the contract might come to an end in relation to the Mike Walsh Show
including termination of the contract by a repudiation
on the part of Channel 9
accepted by Productions.
<P>

107	At trial, Carruthers J gave judgment in favour of Enterprises.  The
judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal (Hope, Priestley
and Meagher JJA),
who found that in the contextual and interrelated contractual background of the
provision, and applying the rule
that no wrongdoer should be permitted to take
advantage of his or her own wrong, the words  `comes to an end' required to be
construed
so as to exclude from their meaning any termination of the agreement
of which the substantial cause was the repudiation.
<P>

108	To my mind, nothing in the decision affects my reasons earlier set out.
The Court of Appeal in <i>TCN Channel 9</i> applied the wrongdoer maxim as a
principle of construction in a situation where the legal wrongdoing in the form
of the repudiation
by a relevant defendant had, on the evidence, in fact taken
place.  The issue in question in the present case raises a question of
fact on
the hypothetical, namely whether it involved legal wrongdoing of WIL.  The
question of principle is not one of construction,
but is whether, bearing in
mind the issues for determination by the referee, by operation of a principle
of law, the wrongdoer maxim
necessarily constrains the selection and use of a
hypothetical comparison for the purposes of the assessment of damages.
<P>

109	Mr Gyles also sought to rely on <i>Bennett v Minister of Community
Welfare</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d92%29%20176%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-92) 176 CLR 408</a> where an action for damages had been brought
by the appellant in relation to loss suffered following the failure of the
respondent
to discharge a relevant duty of care.
<P>

110	In 1973, the appellant, then being a ward of the State of Western
Australia, was injured at the institution where he was in
care while using a
circular saw without a proper guard.  It was common ground that he was entitled
and would have sought to recover
damages for negligence from the Minister of
Community Welfare if he had known of such an entitlement.  It was also accepted
that
the Director of Community Welfare was under a duty to obtain independent
legal advice for the ward about his right to recover damages.
 The Director
failed to discharge this duty.  Before the expiration of the limitation period,
the wardship ceased and the former
ward obtained legal advice.  He was
incorrectly advised that he had no cause of action against the Minister.  It
was only after his
action became statute-barred, that he received proper advice
and sued the Minister for damages in relation to the loss suffered by
the
Director's failure to obtain independent legal advice.
<P>

111	At the trial, Nicholson J held that Bennett was not entitled to recover
damages in relation to the failure to provide proper
legal advice before the
limitation period expired.  An appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court
(Pidgeon and Seaman JJ, Rowland
J dissenting) was dismissed.
<P>

112	The appeal was allowed by all members of the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane,
Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ).  It was held that
the Director's breach of duty
was a causal factor which continued to operate until the limitation period
expired and was not superseded
as the sole cause of the subsequent loss by the
incorrect legal advice obtained after the wardship ceased.
<P>

113	In their joint judgments, Mason CJ, Deane and Toohey JJ said at 413:
<P>

	<i>`In the present case, the Director's breach of duty satisfies the "but for"
test, subject to two assumptions.  If we assume that the
Director had obtained
correct independent legal advice as to the appellant's rights and that the
appellant (or an appropriate person
acting on his behalf) had acted on that
advice by commencing an action within time, the relevant loss would not have
occurred.'</i>
<P>

114	Their Honours stated that in relation to the first assumption, the
Director's duty was to obtain legal advice from a `competent
legal practitioner
based on adequate and accurate instructions'.  Similarly, McHugh J noted at 429
that `if the Director had performed
his duty, he would have arranged for the
appellant to consult a legal practitioner of reasonable competence and skill in
the field
of negligence law and would have ensured that the practitioner was
briefed with a full and accurate account of the facts of the case'.
<P>

115	It is these latter statements which are said to go to the issue in question
in the current proceedings.  Mr Gyles sought to
gain support from the fact that
the hypothetical used by the Court to assess damage in <i>Bennett</i> assumed
the appellant would be given `proper' advice and indeed, did not even entertain
the `improper' alternative.  The submission
was that it followed that in the
present case, the hypothetical alternative was similarly constrained.  Mr Gyles
contended that by
analogy the referee was bound as a matter of legal principle,
to consider only those hypothetical contracts that were `proper', that
is,
properly priced.
<P>

116	To my mind, this is not a submission of substance.  In <i>Bennett</i>, the
Director of Community Services was obliged to arrange `proper' advice in order
that he discharge his duty, a duty that was specific
in that case to the
relationship of guardian - ward.  The issues for determination before the
referee are plainly distinguishable
from the issues in <i>Bennett.</i>
<P>

117	In the result, I reject ADC's submission that the referee erred by finding
a hypothetical alternative scenario wherein ADC,
instead of being mislead into
the non-viable ACT contract which had involved steel by the misrepresentation
of WIL as to the viability
of that contract, would have entered into another
contract, also with ACT, which would also have been underpriced by WIL/ACT, and
which would therefore have been equally non-viable, and would have carried the
same adverse financial consequences for ADC.
<P>

118	To my mind, the referee approached the matter correctly in principle.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>The Alleged Findings Contrary to Suggested Uncontradicted Evidence of Mr
Huntstead</b>
<P>

119	I turn then to examine in more detail, the submission that the critical
finding by the referee that ADC would have entered into
a similarly underpriced
contract with ACT for concrete (`the critical finding'), was contrary to the
uncontradicted evidence.
<P>

120	The referee's finding here was that there would have been an alternative
contract with ACT for concrete and that it would have
been underpriced and
therefore non-viable to at least the same degree as the contract in steel, so
that the contract for concrete
would probably have failed in precisely the same
way as the contract for steel and caused the same loss.
<P>

121	The finding at page 84 is in terms:
<P>

	<i>`If there had been no breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 52</a> of the </i><cite><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a></cite><i>, it seems to me that, on the balance of probabilities, ADC would
have entered into a similar contract with ACT for the construction
of the
residential tower in concrete for about the same price and that, in the
circumstances, ADC suffered no loss as a consequence
of WIL's breach of s.
52.'</i>
<P>

122	The position before the referee was that there were two witnesses called by
WIL on the topic of WIL's hypothetical price for
a contract in concrete.  The
first was Mr Huntstead, WIL's Manager Central Engineering, also being Mr
Amman's immediate superior,
who was responsible for recommending to the
directors the offer to be submitted to ADC, including the hypothetical offer
under consideration.
<P>

123	The other witness was Mr Amman, who was a senior estimator but was not the
person responsible for submitting tenders to ADC
and was not responsible for
recommending to WIL's directors that any offer be submitted to ADC.
<P>

124	Only Mr Amman's evidence was referred to by the referee and there was no
reference anywhere in the report to the evidence given
by Mr Huntstead.
<P>

125	At page 74 of the report, the referee first sets out a section of Mr
Amman's evidence and then states that he accepts that evidence.
 The section of
evidence so accepted read as follows:
<P>

	<i>`From mid 1985 until March 1987, I was employed as a senior estimator in
the construction division of White Industries Limited.</i>
<P>

<i>	In the period between 5 January 1987 and 28 January 1987, I was engaged
full time in the preparation and review of the tender for
the Quadrant
project.</i>
<P>

<i>	That tender was based on a concrete car park, steel frame residential tower
and a steel framed office building.</i>
<P>

<i>	The concept of constructing the residential tower in structural steel
rather than in reinforced concrete was conceived by me in or
about late
December 1986 or early January 1987.</i>
<P>

<i>	I calculated the tender price of $18,485,000 submitted by White
Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd ("Whites (ACT)") on 28 January 1987.
 That price
was subsequently increased on 3 February 1987 by $1,050,000 to produce a final
contract sum of $19,535,000 . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	If I have been instructed to calculate the tender price on the assumption
that the residential building was to be constructed using
reinforced concrete
rather than structural steel, but with the building otherwise being the same in
all respects . . . the tender
price which I would have calculated would have
been lesser than the tender price submitted to ADC by $66,710".</i>
<P>

126	ADC submitted before me as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Amman said what he would have done if he had been instructed to
recalculate for concrete instead of steel.  For this purpose,
he carried out
only a "quick calculation" [transcript 243 line 24], adjusting the actual steel
tender by deletion of items referable
to the use of steel and substitution of
items referable to the use of concrete.  He did not purport to say, and was not
in a position
to say, what (if any) price WIL would have submitted had ADC
declined to proceed with the ACT contract in steel, either because Mr
Fischer
had not received the assurances he wanted or because he had not been
sufficiently persuaded by them.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[ADC's submissions paragraph 12]
<P>

127	ADC submitted before me in relation to Mr Huntstead inter alia as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`He was WIL's manager, central engineering, Mr Amman's immediate superior
and responsible for recommending to the directors the offer
to be submitted to
ADC including the hypothetical offer under consideration.  [Huntstead
transcript 23912, Amman transcript 2428
line 5.]</i>
<P>

<i>	His evidence was that, if WIL were asked to change back from steel to
concrete, he would not have recommended Mr Amman's figures
be submitted to ADC;
rather, he would "certainly" have retendered the entire project in concrete
from "square one", "from scratch",
he would not have been content merely with
adjustments either from the steel price, or indeed from the concrete price
which had been
submitted by WIL back in 1985:  Transcript 2393 lines 27-35,
2394 lines 20-22, 2400 lines 39-45, 2401 lines 36-57, 2403 lines 7-22.
 [Note
that in re-examination at transcript 2407-2409, Mr Huntstead was asked a number
of questions about what he had meant by `going
back to scratch' in a different
context, namely in the context of working up the actual price in steel, as
distinct from the hypothetical
alternative price in concrete if steel had been
rejected.  The only evidence in re-examination on what he meant by `going back
to
scratch' in the latter context is (at the most) at transcript 2409 line 45;
2410 line 2, which does not in any way detract from the
evidence in
cross-examination].</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Huntstead regarded Mr Amman's exercise as only a '15 minute exercise in
logic' which might have been carried out only if ADC had
asked how much extra
concrete would cost `as a guess' [transcript 2401 line 44-54].</i>
<P>

<i>	The exercise carried out for the purpose of making an alternative offer to
ADC would have been carried out very carefully, properly
costing all direct
costs, allowing an appropriate amount for overheads (5%), and being very
careful to make sure that items of cost
did not slip through the cracks in this
hypothetical situation of suddenly being asked to go back to an all concrete
building - indeed
WIL would have been better placed to provide a proper price
in concrete then in steel [transcript 2400 lines 47 - 2401 line 31].</i>
<P>

<i>	Having done this and submitted the price to ADC, [Mr Huntstead] would have
had no hesitation in supporting it as an adequate one
[transcript 2403 lines
24-33].</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Huntstead's evidence was not contradicted by other evidence.  It was not
referred to in the WIL submissions `adopted' by the referee.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[ADC's submissions paragraphs 13-14]
<P>

128	As has already been noted, the manner in which the referee proceeded here
was to set out ADC's submissions in his report from
pages 74 to 78 and then to
set out WIL's submissions from pages 78 through to 83 and then to follow at the
top of page 84 with a
paragraph reading:
<P>

	<i>`I agree with the WIL submissions set out above and I adopt the same.  If
there had been no breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 52</a> of the </i><cite><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a></cite><i>, it seems to me that, on the balance of probabilities, ADC would
have entered into a similar contract with ACT for the construction
of the
residential tower in concrete for about the same price and that in the
circumstances ADC suffered no loss as a consequence
of WIL's breach of Section
52.'</i>
<P>

129	In purporting to quote from ADC's submissions, the referee at page 77 of
his report made some important omissions.  Exhibit
P2 before me was an extract
of ADC's submissions in chief to the referee and this may be compared to page
77 of the referee's report.
 
<P>

130	To enable a reader of this judgment to follow the omission, I shall set out
hereunder a section from page 77 of the referee's
report and I shall include in
square brackets the sections from ADC's submissions which are not to be found
at page 77 of the report:
<P>

	<i>`Even if WIL had had a further chance, there is no basis for finding that
it would have put in a price for a concrete project significantly
lower than
other tenderers.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Mr Huntstead, who was responsible at the time, would have "gone back
to square one and had the job retendered from scratch", properly
costing all
direct costs, allowing an appropriate amount for overheads and a <u>5%</u>
profit margin, being very careful (as one would expect, if his first proposal
had been rejected as not viable).  He would <u>not</u> merely have made
adjustments from the 1985 concrete tender, nor from the under-priced steel
tender;  transcript 2393.27, 2400.39-2401.54.
 In that event, WIL is likely to
have tendered <u>more</u> than the estimates of Mr Copping and Mr Makin
($22.48m and $22.42m respectively), which allowed only 3% margin.  Thus, there
is no
reason to think that, after a careful re-pricing, WIL would have had any
significant price advantage over other tenderers.]
<P>

<i>	</i>If [(contrary to Mr Huntstead's evidence)]<i> WIL had merely adjusted
its under-priced steel tender, and come up with an under-priced concrete
tender, ADC would have viewed it
with understandable suspicion, and would have
required to be satisfied that Whites this time knew what they were doing and
could
do what they said and would have required WIL to give sufficient
assurances to that effect </i>[<i>(</i>Mr Fischer Exhibit P6 paras 5, 6;  Mr
Ward Exhibit P9 para 2, transcript 857.21-.48<i>)</i>].<i>  Would Mr Fischer
have been satisfied, and would he have received the assurances?  This is
conjecture upon conjecture.</i>
<P>

<i>	One is on much firmer ground finding on the balance of probabilities that,
if  Mr Fischer had not received or accepted WIL's assurance
about the viability
of its steel proposal, he would have lost confidence in WIL, and looked
elsewhere.'</i>
<P>

131	Mr Gyles submitted that the referee's failure to advert to Mr Huntstead's
evidence compounded by his selective quotation from
ADC's submissions omitting
the references to Mr Huntstead ought be regarded as follows:
<P>

	1.	As showing that there was no factual foundation for the findings.
<P>

	2.	As giving rise to legitimate apprehension by ADC as to the referee's
conduct.
<P>

	3.	As extraordinary.
<P>

	4.	As showing that the referee did not deal with Mr Huntstead's evidence and
reject it but just ignored it.
<P>

	5.	As showing that the referee failed to deal with a crucial piece of evidence
without explanation.
<P>

	6.	As showing that the referee failed to deal with all of the evidence on the
relevant point, namely the evidence of Mr Amann and
Mr Huntstead, in statements
and in cross-examination.
<P>

	7.	As showing that by selectively quoting, the referee had omitted from the
Record any reference to evidence.
<P>

	8.	As showing that the referee edited ADC's submissions in a way which does
not properly reflect the submission and omits a submission
which is contrary to
his finding.
<P>

	9.	As amounting to an irregularity sufficient in itself to cause the Court to
set aside the referee's report or findings.
<P>

	10.	As a course of conduct by the referee to avoid a serious embarrassment.
<P>

132	Mr Gyles submitted that if a referee sets out to give an accurate account
of one party's submissions and omits a particular
section and there is no
rational explanation for this, this is a matter which raises a serious question
of natural justice.
<P>

133	On Mr Gyles' submissions, all the Court requires to find here is that there
was a patent misapprehension of the evidence and
that the omission to refer to
the evidence shows perversity or a manifest unreasonableness in fact finding
and that on these bases
the Court need go no further.
<P>

134	Mr Gyles' submission was that it was inappropriate conduct for a referee to
deliberately omit material in coming to a finding
without explanation and that
this renders that finding unsupportable.
<P>

135	If a referee or judge was required to make a finding as between evidence
given on a particular topic by witnesses A and B (a
matter which would depend
on the significance of the issue to the ultimate question for decision in the
proceedings), and if there
were no other evidence on that topic before the
Court, then it would generally be necessary, it seems to me, for the Court to
treat
with the respective accounts given by such witnesses and to make
appropriate findings as to reliability, or to make plain what were
the
respective contentions of the witnesses as to fact and what are the reasons for
the referee or judge's findings.  It might not
always be necessary for the
referee or judge to expressly refer to the evidence given by witness B, if the
referee or judge's findings
in favour of the version of fact given by witness A
was supported by other evidence before the referee or judge which could explain
that approach.  But absent there being any other evidence before a referee or
judge which could explain why the referee or judge
had accepted witness A's
version, it would seem to me to have been  failure by a referee or judge to
give reasons, for the referee
or judge to simply completely omit any reference
to witness B.
<P>

136	I note that in <i>ECC Lighting Limited v McGurk</i> [Unreported, Supreme
Court of NSW, 22 December 1995, McClelland CJ,] his Honour expressed the view
that `It is sufficient to say
that it is not necessary for a judicial officer
to deal with every factual issue which is thrown up in a case, <i>a</i>
<i>fortiori</i> every factual issue which relates only to the credibility of a
witness.  The desirability of resolving any particular issue will
depend on an
assessment by the judicial officer of such matters as the significance of that
issue to the ultimate questions for determination
in the case and the degree of
confidence with which a decision on that issue can be reached'.  I do not read
this passage as inconsistent
with my view stated above.
<P>

137	Mr Rayment QC took the Court closely through the precise circumstances in
relation to the submissions and evidence which had
been before the referee.
<P>

138	Mr Copping, a quantity surveyor, had been the main expert called before
Giles J by ADC.  Giles J had referred to Mr Copping's
evidence of the
reasonable cost of the work at pages 366 and 367 of the reported judgment.
<P>

139	Mr Copping had worked out what the prices of the parties who put in tenders
in 1985, translated to, for a price in concrete
in January 1987.  Mr Copping
had, in short, given adjustments to prices which each party had put in, in
1985, to work out a notional
price for each in concrete - that is to work out
what the reasonable price in concrete would have been.
<P>

140	Paragraphs 9 to 14 of Mr Copping's statement of 21 April 1996 had been in
the following terms:
<P>

	<cite>`Likely Cost in Concrete - Based on Earlier Tenders</cite>
<P>

<i>	9.	Further, I have been asked by the plaintiff to provide an opinion of an
indicative cost of the works based on the tenders received
by the Plaintiff on
an early design concept of the Quadrant project in 1985 ("the Dysart"
scheme).</i>
<P>

<i>	10.	Specifically, I was requested to:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	adjust the tenders for inflation or other price adjustment between 1985
and February 1987;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	make allowance for the modifications to the "Dysart scheme" contained
in Group Architects' drawings referred to in the Annexure
marked "B" hereto
("the Group Architect's scheme").</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	make an allowance for my assessment of the likely cost to carry out
and complete provisional sum items;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	make an allowance for the likely cost of the design work.</i>
<P>

<i>	11.	I have been advised by the plaintiff that seven tenders were received
on or about 28 June 1985 by the plaintiff ranging from
$17,900,000 to
$22,855,246 and that all tenders included a provisional sum allowance of
$3,863,700.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.	I have examined the drawings and design of the Dysart scheme that
relate to the 1985 tenders together with the Group Architects'
scheme
modifications.  I have not prepared a measured estimate, however, the scope of
modifications in the Group Architects' scheme
indicate potential savings in the
order of 6-8% of the tender figures.  The actual saving would likely be
dependent upon the negotiation
skills of the parties and the contractor's need
for the project.</i>
<P>

<i>	13.	During the period June 1985 and February 1987, significant increases in
building costs occurred.  The National All Works Index
issued by the then
Department of Housing and Construction indicated that the index for the
Australian Capital Territory rose from
a level of 88 at 1 July 1985 to 103 at 1
January 1987, an increase of 17% for the period.  Annexed hereto and marked "C"
is a true
copy of the published ACT indexes for 1 July 1985 and 1 January
1987.</i>
<P>

<i>	14.	Accordingly, in my opinion, an indicative cost estimate for February
1987 based upon the Dysart scheme tenders in 1985 (other
than white Industries
Ltd's tender) as adjusted by:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the modifications referred to in the Group Architects' scheme;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	escalation in building costs</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	the likely cost of provisional sum items;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	design costs</i>
<P>

<i>	is as follows:</i>

<i>	Accordingly, the range of indicative adjusted tender costs (other than
White Industries Ltd's tender) is $24,181,856.00 to $26,264,152.00.'</i>
<P>

141	When one applied to Mr Copping's reasoning the same adjustments to White's
prices of 1985, the result is a figure of approximately
$20m, being the
equivalent of White's 1985 price for the work to be completed in concrete.
<P>

142	At pages 51 to 52 of the second defendant's submissions before me entitled
`Overview of Submissions of Exxon', a section of
Mr Rayment's oral submissions
for ADC to the referee shortly before the referee reserved was set out.  That
section read as follows:
<P>

	<i>`There's a lot of transcript on this matter that gives difficulty to the
case now made by ADC.  Could we have a look, just before
I go into it, at Mr
Copping's reworking of the tender prices of 1985 in the light of the changes
made other than the change to concrete.
 The document that I want to put before
you is exhibit P17, Patrick Copping's report, where he has reworked the 1985
tenders in the
light of the changes that were made to the project to make it
cheaper.  In that statement he's compared the 1985 tenders.  He's taken
the
second lowest tenderer, Leightons, and then, for the sake of comparison, the
highest tenderer, Costains.  In paragraph 14 of
this statement he said:</i>
<P>

<i>	Accordingly, in my opinion an indicative cost estimate for February 1987 -
that's the critical time -</i>
<P>

<i>	-- based upon the Dysart scheme tenders in 1985 . . . design cost is as
follows.</i>
<P>

<i>	And he then starts off with the Leighton contractors amount.  He allows 5
per cent for design fees, providing a subtotal of $21m,
takes off the original
PC sum, then he says that the savings have amounted to 7 per cent, so he takes
the 7 per cent off.  He then
allows escalation at 17 per cent and brings back
provisional sums as per paragraph 4 of this statement at $4,456,000, which then
becomes a constant in the next analysis as well.</i>
<P>

<i>	It so happens, Mr Referee, that if you apply the same analysis as Mr
Copping there uses to the Whites original tender of $17,900,000,
you produce a
total figure of $20,702,760.  These figures are all on the transcript.  It's
just arithmetical.  I think my learned
friend mentioned that he had checked
this.  At page 2981, Mr Liney helpfully said, "I have done it and come up with
the same figure
as Mr Goldstein".  That same figure is $20,702,760.  Just so
that we may have it completely clear, I'll quickly put those figures
on the
transcript, if I may, so that we have a full record of them.</i>
<P>

<i>	The White figure corresponding to the Leighton contractors figure of
$25,945,148 is $17,900,000.  5 per cent for design fees is $895,000.
 The
subtotal of those two figures is $18,795,000.  You then subtract the same PC
allowance of $3,863,700 to produce a subtotal of
$14,931,300.  You then take
off 7 per cent of that figure by way of savings and that comes to $1,045,191,
producing a subtotal of
$13,886,109.  You then add escalation of 17 per cent,
or $2,360,639, to produce a subtotal of $16,246,748.  Then you add back
provisional
sums as per paragraph 4 of the statement, $4,456,012, to produce a
total sum of $20,702,760.  That figure is the Whites constructed
contract
price, in our submission.  It's a very similar figure when you change the PC
sum that was included in the final Whites price
to the price that was allowed
for the construction in steel, as it happens.</i>
<P>

<i>	If Whites were asked to give their concrete price in January 1987 and they
went through the exercise described by Mr Copping, the
figure they would have
come up with on that basis would be, including his PC sums, $20,702,760, or, if
you took the actual PC sums
used in the Whites contract, it would come to
$20,160,748.</i>
<P>

<i>	Against that is the Leightons price, which remember was unavailable.
Leightons had told Mr Ward that they were not interested at
all in doing this
job in January 1987.  Mr Ward rang them and asked them whether they would give
him a second price just before he
entered into the contract with Whites, and he
wrote a couple of letters to them.  But he gave evidence that they said that
they were
not interested in quoting.'</i>
<P>

143	Thus, before Mr Huntstead and Mr Amann had given evidence before the
referee, there had been some evidence to support the referee's
finding that the
White's price would have been approximately that which Mr Huntstead and Mr
Amann later gave evidence that the price
would have been for concrete.  Mr
Rayment pointed out that the same evidence would simply have required Whites to
be consistent with
the prices Whites had been informing ADC of for the previous
eighteen months.
<P>

144	The referee referred to Mr Copping's evidence in his report at pages 78 to
79.  This was a section where the referee set out
a segment of WIL's
submissions.  That section of WIL's submissions had read, inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Another important matter was that Whites were the only builders in the
field in 1986 and in early 1987.  A belated attempt was made
in January 1987 to
obtain a check price from Leightons but that company would not provide a price.
In any event, Fischer was not
too enamoured with Leighton.  ADC had time
imperatives.  It faced the prospect that the Commonwealth might forfeit the
Lease unless
there was a contract with an approved builder prior to 31 March
1987.  ADC's second cheapest builder from 1985 was no longer interested.
 ADC
did not wish to forfeit the Lease from the Crown.  Another builder would need
time before being able to (sic) a lump sum price.
 This project was not fully
designed in 1987.  Since detailed measurements were unavailable, other builders
might have included a
larger premium for contingencies.  ADC has not found one
builder to give evidence as to the price at which it would have offered
to
build this project in 1987.  Mr Copping's adjustments to the 1985 prices
produce a figure similar to the Whites price.  That tends
to confirm the
reliability of Mr Copping's indicative prices as to the lump sum prices which
the other tenderers would have quoted.
 A mid range figure is $25m.  Tenders
from others it called in 1987 would not have been for less than the range
suggested by Mr Copping
of $24-26m.  At those levels, all would have been
rejected by ADC.  The only builder whose price was likely to have been
acceptable
to ADC on a lump sum basis was Whites;  if not in steel, then for a
similar sum in concrete.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

145	This section of course comprises part of the WIL submissions which the
referee accepted and adopted at page 84.
<P>

146	I accept Mr Rayment's submission that it was sufficient for the referee to
make his findings by applying the same analysis as
Mr Copping had given in his
evidence, to Whites' original tender.  As Mr Rayment pointed out in the above
extract from his oral submissions
to the referee, the extrapolation is simply
arithmetical.  Importantly, this is an area in relation to which the referee's
specialist
background and expertise may be expected to be brought to bear.  The
question which remains, however, is whether in the light of
Mr Huntstead's oral
evidence, the referee was obliged to give reasons for accepting or rejecting
all or part of Mr Huntstead's evidence.
<P>

147	Mr Rayment then submitted that a close examination of what had in fact
occurred here was necessary as background material. 
That background he
submitted, included the matters set out in the following paragraphs.
<P>

148	Whites had tendered for the job first in 1985.
<P>

149	Then the job had been shorn of some of its more expensive portions and
Whites had retendered.  This was after Mr Fischer's in-house
employed architect
had redesigned in part the Dysart design to make it cheaper.
<P>

150	A White's price was then given for the project as redesigned by the
in-house architect.
<P>

151	Then, as the approach to the first contract took place in the last few
months leading up to February 1997, Mr Amann, at the
request of Mr Huntstead,
had gone back and had repriced the price from scratch, to prepare the estimate
that was finally given shortly
before the contract was entered into.
<P>

152	The White's price was adjusted yet again.
<P>

153	Although Whites had been giving prices from time to time over an 18-month
period, it had not simply adjusted its price for inflation
and the
incorporation of steel when the final price was given.  It was priced from
scratch.  The residential tower was to have had
the steel frame.  Usually steel
frames would only be found in office buildings.  Because there was steel, the
question arose as to
how the contract could be made viable.
<P>

154	Mr Amann's original statement of 26 November 1994, appearing at page 98 of
Exhibit D1, which had been before the referee, included
a statement in
paragraph 33 that in the period between 5 January 1987 and 28 January 1987, he
had been engaged full time in the preparation
and review of the tender for the
quadrant project.  He went on to say in the same paragraph, `The preparation of
that tender included
. . . pricing up the various work components from first
principles'.
<P>

155	Hence, on Mr Rayment's submissions, Mr Amann had given evidence in his
initial statement of November 1994 to that effect.
<P>

156	Mr Huntstead, in his initial statement dated 23 November 1994, had said in
paragraphs 44 and 45 as follows:
<P>

	<i>'44.	By the time that the contract for the Quadrant project was signed on
25 February 1987, the tender had been reviewed to varying
degrees by at least
four experienced personnel including Messrs Amann, Allen, Owen and myself.  In
addition Mr Graham had provided
input into certain aspects of the tender.  I
formed the view that the basis upon which this project had been tendered was
reasonable
and that the project could be constructed for the price and within
the time allowed.</i>
<P>

<i>	45.	The price for the quadrant project was </i><cite>determined from first
principles.  Fresh quotes were obtained.  In some instances old quotes were
simply updated</cite><i>.  In addition spreadsheets showing trade summaries
were also prepared.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

157	There were then two further statements filed before the new referee, Mr
Morrisey.  Mr Amann's further statement was dated 21
August 1997 and is
annexure `A' to the affidavit of Mr Earls, made on 3 December 1998.  Mr
Huntstead's further statement was dated
11 September 1997 and was Annexure `C'
to Mr Earls' affidavit.
<P>

158	In Mr Amann's further statement, he had stated in paragraph 6 that if he
had been instructed to calculate the tender price on
the assumption that the
residential building was to be constructed using reinforced concrete rather
than structural steel, but with
the building otherwise being the same in all
respects, the changes to his calculations would have been in a particular form
and he
had then set them out.  In short, the calculations meant a total
increase in cost of some $492,000.
<P>

159	It is important to note that Mr Amann in this statement did not say
anything about how he had originally calculated the quotation.
 He did not
refer to the matter set out in his earlier statement made years earlier.
<P>

160	Mr Huntstead in his further statement had said:
<P>

<i>	`2	At no time during my negotiations with Australian Development
Corporation Pty Limited ("ADC") from June 1985 until February 1987
was I
informed by any of the other tenderers, or by ADC, that WIL's price was some $3
million lower than the nearest tenderer.  In
the period following the
submission of our tender to ADC in June 1985, I was involved in the formulation
of a number of cost saving
proposals which had the effect of reducing our price
from $17.9 million in June 1985 to about $16 million in May 1986.  I refer to
paragraphs 2 to 6 of my statement of 23 November 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Between 21 January 1987 and 28 January 1987 I carried out a review of our
proposal for the Quadrant project which had largely been
prepared by Mr Robert
Amann.  That proposal was based on a steel framed residential tower.  At the
time I recall satisfying myself
as to the reasonableness of that tender.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	On or about 28 January 1987 I forwarded our offer of $18,485,000 to ADC.
A copy of that offer is annexed hereto.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	On or about 28 January 1987 I directed Mr Amann to forward a facsimile to
ADC, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked `B'.</i>
<P>

<i>6.	I have been asked to assume that at or about the date, I asked Mr Amann
to adjust the estimate to as to provide for the residential
tower to be
constructed in concrete.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	I have read the statement of Robert Amann dated 21 August 1997.
</i><cite>In my opinion the calculations undertaken by Mr Amann as to the
additional direct costs of constructing the residential tower in concrete
appear reasonable, based on individual rates at the time</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>8.	However, in addition to the direct costs identified by Mr Amann I would
also have recommended an addition sum of $183,917 to cover
additional time
related overheads.  This is because, in my opinion, the concrete framed
residential tower would have taken about
2 months longer to construct than a
steel framed structure.  My calculation of the additional sum for time related
overheads would
have been as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>Amount allowed in tender for preliminaries		= $2,207,000 (24 months)</i>
<P>

<i>Therefore monthly allowance for preliminaries	= $91,958/month</i>
<P>

<i>Therefore additional allowance for 2 months		= $183,917</i>
<P>

<i>Annexed hereto and marked `C' is a copy of my Final Tender Summary dated 28
January1987.</i>
<P>

<i>9.	In addition to the amounts determined in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, I
would also have recommended an additional sum of $33,831 as
profit for the
additional costs.  This amount has been calculated as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	Direct costs as calculated by Mr Amann		= $492,710</i>
<P>

<i>	Additional preliminaries				= $183,917</i>
<P>

<i>	Sub total						= $676,627</i>
<P>

<i>	Allow 5% for profit on additional costs		= $33,831</i>
<P>

<i>10.	Accordingly, </i><cite>at or about 28 January 1987 I would have
submitted a price of around $19,195,000 ($18,485,000 + $492,710 + $183,917 +
$33,831) for
constructing the residential tower in concrete rather than in
steel</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[emphasis added]
<P>

161	It is important to note in relation to Mr Huntstead's further statement,
that he did not direct his mind to how Mr Amann had
prepared the quotations
which actually went to ADC in January 1987.  In short, Mr Huntstead does not
repeat his own evidence that
this had been done from scratch - see his earlier
statement.
<P>

162	One then turns to examine closely the transcript before the referee of Mr
Huntstead.  That transcript is part of Annexure `D'
to Mr Earls' Affidavit.
<P>

163	I accept Mr Rayment's submission that the evidence given before the referee
at page 2393 line 16 through to 35 does not suggest
that Mr Huntstead was
assuming that there had been fresh work carried out in January 1987 from
scratch.  It does appear from that
transcript that Mr Huntstead's assumption
was that all of the older quotations had been out of date and that Mr Huntstead
in giving
this evidence, had forgotten that in January 1987 they had gone back
to scratch.
<P>

164	Mr Rayment's submission was that the referee did not actually have to refer
to Mr Huntstead in his report because there was
no relevant conflict between Mr
Amann and Mr Huntstead or between Mr Copping and Mr Amann or between Mr Copping
and Mr Huntstead.
 On Mr Rayment's submissions, they were all at one in having
expressed the view that the price would have been approximately $20m,
or in
having given evidence which would support that proposition.
<P>

165	In short, Mr Rayment's submission was that there was evidence before the
referee to support a finding that the price for which
Whites would have quoted
for concrete would have been approximately $20m and that such a finding could
be approached by a number
of routes.
<P>

166	Mr Copping, Mr Rayment pointed out, had carried out a theoretical exercise
which produced the consequence that the price which
Whites assert they would
have given in concrete, was indeed the price which results from the
extrapolation of their earlier prices
when one allows for inflation and changes
and similar.  This, as Mr Rayment submits, shows that Whites' prices would in
all likelihood
have been about $20m.
<P>

167	Another route which Mr Rayment submitted was open to the referee to follow,
was by reference to the procedure which had been
followed from mid-1986 on, and
which had involved the quotation of prices by Whites which started with Mr
Amann recommending the
price to Mr Huntstead, who in turn recommended it up the
line.  See page 101 of Exhibit D1, paragraphs 16-19 of Mr Amann's statement
of
26 November 1994.
<P>

168	The same persons, namely Mr Amann and Mr Huntstead, were again called by
WIL to say what they would have done had the change
occurred back to concrete.
Mr Rayment submitted that their evidence, properly understood, supports a
finding that the price for which
Whites would have quoted in concrete would
have been $20m.
<P>

169	Mr Rayment's effective submission was that the referee did not require to
refer to Mr Huntstead's evidence at all as the matter
on a close examination of
the transcript resulting in page 2417 had become a non-issue.  Mr Rayment
submitted that the Court should
view what the referee had said at transcript
page 2417 as indicative that Mr Huntstead's evidence was not of live
significance for
the referee or as an issue between the parties.
<P>

170	Mr Liney's cross-examination of Mr Huntstead, commencing at transcript page
2391 (forming part of annexure `D' to Mr Earls'
affidavit), drew an answer at
page 2393 lines 20 to 22, that it would not have been Mr Huntstead's
recommendation that Mr Amann's
calculations would have been submitted to ADC as
an alternative.  This was not, however, an answer to be viewed in isolation.
It
certainly seems to be inconsistent with Mr Huntstead's supplementary
statement.  It was, however, an answer on which ADC was entitled
to place some
reliance, and a piece of evidence to which the referee, it seems to me, ought
to have referred in giving his reasons
for coming to the critical finding.
<P>

171	Mr Liney continued later in his cross-examination of Mr Huntstead at
transcript page 2399 lines 57 and following, to suggest
to Mr Huntstead a real
world scenario of what had happened back in 1987 in relation to the actual
tender.  The cross-examination
then at transcript page 2400 lines 34 to 45,
elicited evidence that had a concrete option been chosen, Mr Huntstead would
have probably,
and indeed almost certainly, have re-tendered the entire project
`if it was to be considered only in concrete from square 1 from
scratch in the
original documents and re-tendered the whole project based on a concrete option
with a concrete duration, etc.'
<P>

172	Later, Mr Liney's cross-examination at transcript page 2401 elicited the
following answers:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	I perhaps had misunderstood, as it were, where you were coming from
when you came to give evidence today.  So I take it that you
don't - let me
start again:  Mr Amann has gone through this very complicated exercise of
making adjustments from the steel price
to come up with a concrete price.  You
don't thinks that's what would have happened at all?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	And . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Excuse me, if I may - had ADC asked us how much extra as a guess -
</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Sure.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	- It might - it would have been a 15 minute exercise.  We might have
said "That's about how much extra it would cost".</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Exactly.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	But it would not be the basis of a detailed estimate and
submission.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Thank you.  That's very helpful by way of clarification.  I take it that
insofar as Mr Amann has carried out this detailed adjustment
exercise, that's
not something that you've really gone into the details of?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I've looked at his figures.  I've seen the logic behind his figures.
I've agreed that the logic is reasonable and the costs appear
to be pertaining
as the costs at that time and for a 15 minute exercise in logic, it appears
reasonable that that would have been
of the order of the adjustments . .
.'</i>
<P>

173	At transcript page 2401 lines 52 and following, the cross-examination
included the following:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	So in the exercise that you think you would have done of going back to
square 1 would not have been merely the 1985 tender, would
it?  You wouldn't
have simply adjusted that.  That would just be an adjustment?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	The scope of works appeared to change between '85 and '86, indeed '86 to
late '86.  I think we would have tried to re-establish
what concrete design was
required and on the basis of that.  We would have tendered on that basis.
Whichever was the most recent
and the viable option that was being desired at
that stage . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	Let me take you perhaps just to paragraph 8 fairly briefly now.  Since
the exercise you have done there really is hypothetical
in the extreme in the
light of what you have said.  You say in the first sentence that you would have
recommended - and by the way
you mean to Mr Allen?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	I would have recommended to the Board of Whites.  Yes.  Mr Allen being
the appropriate person.  Mr Allen yes . . .'</i>
<P>

174	In re-examination, Mr Rayment took Mr Huntstead back to his earlier
statement and asked him in relation to paragraph 45 of that
statement what this
meant `in relation to going back to scratch or otherwise'.  The answer recorded
at transcript page 2407, going
over to 2408 with following questions, was as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	What does that mean in relation to going back to scratch or
otherwise?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	That means that the original price </i>[I interpolate that this referred
to the 1985 price]<i> was based on tender documents derived from first
principles.  As variations were proposed, those variations were adjusted to our
original tender price and the material quotations and sub-contract quotations
were reviewed at subsequent tender submissions, i.e.
1986 and early 1987.  In
other words, the tender price was essentially the same as - was based on the
1985 tender with adjustments
as per quantity changes and scope changes.  So we
would have gone back to - we would have gone back and priced the variations
from
square 1 . . . and those prices were effected in a revised price to the
ADC, in July '86 or June '86.  I believe there was a re-submission
based on an
alternative design and that is would have been done from first principles,
again using the 1985 tender as a base.  So
as I said in my statement.  Fresh
quotes were obtained.  In some cases old quotes were simply updated and
additional trade summaries
were also prepared for the new scope of
works.'</i>
<P>

175	Mr Rayment then, in re-examination at page 2409 of the transcript asked,
inter alia, the following questions:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	In other words may we have it clear, what did happen when Amman
recommended that the steel be used in respect to the actual tender
that went in
1987?  Was it the result of going back to scratch in part, in whole or what was
the situation?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	In part it would have been going back to square 1 in part.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	In part?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes.  A lot of work goes into a tender in terms of a number of different
areas and if a tender is varied by a particular amount
such as concrete slabs
in this case, you would go back and you would work out what the original
concrete was.  The original formwork
was on the original design, price up a new
design based on the new formwork allowance, the edge strips, the stairways, the
columns
on the new scheme and reprice it from scratch.  So whereas the whole
tender wouldn't be repriced from scratch, the whole element
of concrete
formwork and reinforcing steel would be looked at and an adjustment made on
that component of the work.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.	You have been saying this morning that something would have caused you
to go back to scratch;  is that in whole or in part that
you were speaking
about this morning, first of all, so far as the change?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Once again, we would have gone back to scratch.  We wouldn't have
probably looked at things like windows or doors or things like
that.  But we
would have looked at the structural component again of the building.'</i>
<P>

176	Debate took place before me as to whether this answer, recorded at page
2409 line 50 and following, insofar as it uses the words
`we would have gone
back to scratch' was to be construed by the referee as a statement by Mr
Huntstead of what actually did take
place or alternatively, of what would have
taken place in the hypothetical scenario.
<P>

177	At transcript page 2409 line 36, Mr Rayment sought in re-examination, to
ask the following question:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Mr Huntstead, may we clarify one other thing, please, about your
evidence this morning about going back to scratch.  You have
told us what did
happen when steel was recommended and that involved in effect going back to
scratch on those items where steel was
going in instead of concrete.'</i>
<P>

178	Mr Rayment then asked at transcript 55:  
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Just disregard my summary, if you would and remember what you yourself
have said about the matter if the matter of steel had never
come up at all in
late 1986.  How would things have been different in relation to the . . . if
the matter of steel had never come
up at all.  In 1986.  How would things have
been different in relation to this tender?'</i>
<P>

179	This question then elicited an objection in respect of which the respective
submissions are set out at pages 2411 through to
2418.
<P>

180	Mr Liney's objection appears to be based on the proposition that the whole
of WIL's case had been built upon the foundation
that the relevant question to
ask was whether, if ADC had not been misled by White's misrepresentation into
contracting for steel,
they would have gone away and re-priced in concrete and
if so what that re-pricing would have constituted.
<P>

181	Indeed, Mr Liney at transcript page 2417 line 1 in submission said:  `There
is nothing to be gained by going back to some time
in 1986 and speculating as
to what would have happened if steel never come up at all.  That's no part of
anybody's case . . .'
<P>

182	Mr Rayment in dealing with the objection at transcript 2417, completed his
submissions by pointing out that the question which
he submitted he was
entitled to ask was `when he said that he would be going back to scratch, was
he [assuming] that he was changing
from . . . steel to concrete, or was he
assuming that the question simply arose in the context of putting in a tender
in concrete
in the first place?'
<P>

183	Immediately following Mr Rayment's statement identifying the question which
his clients sought to put was the following exchange:
<P>

	<i>`The referee:  I thought from what I heard of his evidence that he made it
pretty clear on that question?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Rayment:  But he was assuming the change.</i>
<P>

<i>	The referee:  What he would do.  What part he would go back to scratch
on?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Rayment:  Oh yes, he made it clear.</i>
<P>

<i>	The referee:  Change in the structure?</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Rayment:  Yes.  He made it clear that he would be looking at only the
relevant bits.</i>
<P>

<i>	The referee:  Yes.  That's what one would normally expect.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Rayment:  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	The referee:  I uphold the objection.'</i>
<P>

184	To my mind this is not a situation in which the Court can glean from what
the referee said at transcript at page 2417 an indication
that Mr Huntstead's
evidence was not of live significance for the referee, or was not evidence
which went to a matter which remained
a live issue between the parties.  The
Court is in the dark as to the referee's assessment of Mr Huntstead's evidence
in terms of
all the evidence before the referee in a situation in which there
was evidence that it would have been his recommendation to the
Board of Whites
through Mr Noel Allen, the General Manager, New South Wales Construction, which
would have been given.  Further,
on Mr Huntstead's evidence, Mr Allen's
responsibility at the time was `to get the contract signed off'.  See Mr
Huntstead's evidence
before the referee at page 2391.
<P>

185	I have not found the question of whether the referee ought be obliged to
give reasons for how he assessed Mr Huntstead's evidence
an easy one in this
case.  For that reason I have gone into considerable detail above in setting
out how I understand the issue to
be put by the respective parties.
<P>

186	There are undoubtedly factors which tend to support the view that the
factual issue and the evidence adduced in relation to
it, has been properly
explored and considered by the referee and hence which would support a view
that it is unnecessary to refer
the matter back to the referee for his reasons
relating to Mr Huntstead's evidence material to the critical finding.
<P>

187	Another factor which tends to support the view that it is unnecessary to
refer the matter back to the referee is that the issue
under consideration
required the referee to bring to bear a real element of his own expertise in
understanding the practices of quotations
in the building industry weighed in
the light:
<P>

	(a)	of detailed evidence as to how previous quotations had been prepared and
revised;
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	of the necessity to weigh statements by those involved at the time,
as to what they now assert they would have done in an abstract
situation.
<P>

188	I am also conscious of the fact that the referee was not bound to accept
the evidence of any of Messrs Amann, Huntstead or indeed
of Mr Fischer, on any
aspect of the hypothetical question posed - all of the facts, matters and
circumstances in evidence before
the referee were to be weighed in balance and
Mr Huntstead's evidence as to what he would have done or recommended if asked
to requote
in concrete, even had it been clear, which it was not, would not
have required to be accepted by the referee.
<P>

189	I have also had in mind that there was, it seems to me, evidence before the
referee namely that given by Mr Copping, that given
by Mr Amann and that given,
at least in his supplementary statement, by Mr Huntstead, which it seems to me
was sufficient to entitle
the referee to come to the so-called `critical
finding'.
<P>

190	I hasten to add that I do not see the fact that the referee edited out of
ADC's submissions those sections of the submissions
which went to certain of Mr
Huntstead's evidence, as supporting any inference of misconduct by the referee.
This is particularly
because the referee in fact made a practice throughout his
report of setting out submissions in an edited fashion.  To my mind, the
referee's failure to include this portion of ADC's written submissions may well
be explicable by the referee having at the time,
intended to later refer to
ADC's submissions as to Mr Huntstead and at that time to indicate what his
views were with respect to
those submissions.  However, as is apparent from the
report, the referee never in fact returned to these submissions.
<P>

191	Mr Huntstead's evidence appears to me to have been by no means clear or
unambiguous and in any event, plainly involved the necessity
to cope <i>ex post
facto</i> with a hypothetical situation all the more confused as:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Huntstead appears under cross-examination to have incorrectly assumed
that all of the older quotations had been out of date
and to have forgotten
that in January 1987 Whites had obtained fresh quotes.
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	Mr Huntstead was asked by Mr Liney in cross-examination, certain
questions seeking to test his views by reference to a context,
including the
findings in these proceedings, that the price submitted to ADC in 1987 was in
fact several million dollars below a
reasonable cost to carry out the work that
was being tendered for.
<P>

192	It is of course important to note that the Court, in reviewing the report
and deciding whether to adopt, vary or reject it,
has a judicial discretion to
exercise in a manner that is consistent both with the object and purpose of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a> and with the wider setting in which they take their part -
see Gleeson CJ in <i>Super</i> at page 563.
<P>

193	At the end of the day and whilst I acknowledge that the contrary view is
clearly open, I am not comfortable with the referee
having failed to even
advert to Mr Huntstead's evidence and have reached the conclusion that the
appropriate direction is that the
referee ought be obliged to give his reasons
relating to Mr Huntstead's evidence material to his critical finding, and that
this
matter is appropriate for reference back to the referee.  Notwithstanding
Mr Rayment's careful analysis of Mr Huntstead's cross-examination,
it does seem
to me that there is substance in Mr Gyles' submission that the referee's
reasoning and failure to expressly specifically
treat with Mr Huntstead's
evidence, requires to be referred back to the referee.  To my mind, this is a
situation in which the referee's
views on Mr Huntstead as a witness and the
referee's acceptance or rejection in whole or in part of Mr Huntstead's
evidence, ought
to have been the subject of explicit reasons in the referee's
report.
<P>

	<b>The Referee's Suggested Internal Contradictory Findings</b>
<P>

194	These submissions [earlier set out in paragraph 51 of this Judgment and
comprising paragraphs numbered 25 to 28 of ADC's submissions
of 9 July 1998]
focus on the apparent inconsistency of two sentences in the report.  The last
sentence appears at page 46 of the
report at the end of the fourth paragraph
and reads:
<P>

	<i>`I conclude, at least on the balance of probabilities, that present (sic)
is a "no transaction" case, not a "successful transaction"
case.'</i>
<P>

195	The second sentence is to be found in the report at page 82 where, in
repeating WIL's submissions with which the referee agreed
and then adopted, the
referee repeats the following portion of the submission:
<P>

	<i>`This is a case where the plaintiff cannot correctly say that but for the
breach of Section 52, no contract at all would have been
entered into with
ACT.'</i>
<P>

196	The burden of ADC's submission is simply that the later finding contradicts
the referee's earlier independent finding, in the
light of which earlier
finding the later finding it is submitted, cannot stand.
<P>

197	Early in the report [at pages 6 to 7], the referee set out the alternative
contentions of the plaintiff ADC and of WIL.  He
pointed out at page 6 that the
plaintiff had submitted, inter alia that:
<P>

	<i>`It is important to recognise that the present is a "no transaction" case,
not a "successful transaction" case.  But for the misrepresentation
there would
have been </i><cite>no transaction</cite><i> with ACT.'</i>
<P>

198	The referee at page 7 pointed out that WIL had submitted that:
<P>

	<i>`It will be apparent that one of our primary submissions is that this is
not a "no transaction" case.  We say that if the relevant
misrepresentation had
not be made, a slightly different contract would have been entered into between
Whites and ADC . . .'</i>
<P>

199	Mr Rayment submitted that in any event the use of the expression `a no
transaction case' is somewhat bedevilling and may well
be ambiguous.  He
submitted that precision of definition was particularly important here.
<P>

200	By way of example, Mr Rayment submitted that if one posited a customer
entering into a fruit shop and the proprietor falsely
representing that all the
oranges in the shop had been picked that morning when in fact those oranges had
been refrigerated for months,
one might posit that the customer, on the basis
of the representation, purchased an orange and later suffered ill effects
because
the orange was bad.
<P>

201	Using this example, Mr Rayment asked the question whether or not it could
be properly described as a "no transaction" case.

<P>

202	If it were proven that but for the representation the customer would have
purchased an apple in the same shop, Mr Rayment again
posed the question as to
whether this would be appropriately described as a "no transaction" case.
<P>

203	The submission, again using this example, was that in "no transaction"
cases, one usually has only apples on sale.  That may
be the case, Mr Rayment
pointed out, if the shop only sold apples and no other fruit.  Then certainly,
but for the misrepresentation,
it could be proven that the customer would not
have entered into the transaction - and in this sense Mr Rayment submitted it
could
be described as a "no transaction" case.
<P>

204	Mr Rayment's submission was that it was always clear before the referee
that WIL's case was that the referee was bound to accept
that but for the
misrepresentation, the contract for in part building in steel, would not have
been entered into.
<P>

205	In that sense, certainly Mr Rayment submitted the present was always on
WIL's submissions to the referee, a "no transaction"
case.  But for the
misrepresentation, the contract to build in steel would never have been entered
into.  Mr Rayment pointed out
that Mr Yeldham QC had so found and that Giles J
had adopted the finding in this respect.
<P>

206	Mr Rayment pointed out that WIL's case before the referee had always been
that but for the misrepresentation, ADC would have
entered into a different
contract, namely a contract to build in concrete.
<P>

207	In the result, on Mr Rayment's submissions as I understood them, there was
some looseness of precision in the referee's use
of the words `no transaction
case' in certain of the passages in the report.  For example, when the referee
at page 6 of the report
set out the plaintiff's submission that `it is
important to recognise that the present is a "no transaction" case, not a
"successful
transaction" case', Mr Rayment submitted that the use by the
referee of the words `a "no transaction" case' seems to have been clearly
to
suggest that there would have been no dealing at all, that is to say, that but
for the misrepresentation, ADC would not have entered
into <u>any</u> form of
contract to build the project.
<P>

208	Mr Rayment's submission, which it seems to me has substance, is that it is
important to return to focus upon what the referee
found as to the relevant
facts.  I accept Mr Rayment's submission that, focussing on the facts found by
the referee, it is clear
from the passage at report page 82, that the referee,
in adopting WIL's submission that the plaintiff could not correctly say that
but for the breach of s. 52, no contract at all would have been entered into
with ACT, the referee was making plain that he was accepting
the second
defendant's submission earlier set out at page 7 of the report, namely that if
the relevant misrepresentation had not
been made, a slightly different contract
would have been entered into between Whites and ADC.
<P>

209	I accept this submission by Mr Rayment.
<P>

210	Mr Rayment also submitted that the last sentence of the fourth paragraph on
page 46 of the report did not flow in any sense
from the earlier sentences in
that paragraph and could effectively be disregarded in terms of understanding
the whole of the report.
<P>

211	To my mind, Mr Rayment's submissions here are of substance.  It may be that
the last sentence in paragraph 4 on page 46 of the
report is sufficiently
unimportant in the context of the whole of the report that it may be
disregarded.  On the other hand, it may
be that the referee's use in that place
in the report of the term `a no transaction case' is explicable in some way by
reference
to the referee's contraposition in the sentence of that expression
with the expression `a successful transaction case'.
<P>

212	No case has been made out for an exercise of the Court's discretion by
ordering that the matter be remitted to the referee to
require an explanation
as to the use by him of the sentence in the report.  Nor has the issue
otherwise raised a question requiring
a rejection of the report.
<P>

	<b>The Referee's Suggested Misapprehension of the Evidence of Mr
Fischer</b>
<P>

213	ADC's submissions earlier set out in paragraph 52 of this Judgment as
numbered paragraphs 29 to 33 inclusive, to my mind have
no substance.  The
referee clearly accepted WIL's submission that Mr Fischer's evidence on the
points set out in the last paragraph
on page 79 of the report and following
through the whole of page 80 of the report should be rejected.  ADC's
submission before me
amounts to asking the Court to accept evidence of Mr
Fischer that was rejected by the referee.
<P>

214	The referee plainly rejected Mr Fischer's evidence that he would have only
proceeded to contract with ACT for concrete if he
had obtained appropriate
assurances from WIL.
<P>

215	The referee had the opportunity to listen to the evidence given by Mr
Fischer and to determine whether or not to accept that
evidence or whether to
reject the evidence on the basis that it was self-serving and contrary to the
probabilities.  WIL in its submissions
to the referee, clearly treated with Mr
Fischer's evidence and with the context.  The referee clearly adopted and
accepted and agreed
with WIL's submissions on the point.  ADC's submissions
suggesting the misapprehension by the referee of the evidence of Mr Fischer
are
rejected, the matter essentially being one of fact determined by the
referee.
<P>

216	ADC's further submissions as to the suggested misapprehension by the
referee of the evidence of Mr Fischer (see ADC's submissions
paragraphs 34 to
37 inclusive, earlier set out in paragraph 52 of this Judgment), again in my
view, are not submissions of substance
as to my mind, they simply seek to have
this Court accept evidence by Mr Fischer which the referee clearly determined
to reject.
 There was evidence from Mr Fischer before the referee to the effect
of that generally set out in paragraph 34(a) and (b) of ADC's
submissions.  I
do not accept the submission that the referee misstated the evidence of Mr
Fischer in a material way or that there
is any ground for the submission that
there was no basis for the finding that Mr Fischer had no concern about price
except in the
context of a steel frame.  I do not accept the submission that
the referee's rejection of Mr Fischer's evidence that he would have
required
assurance from WIL was unsound and should be rejected as put in paragraph 37 of
ADC's submissions.
<P>

	<b>The Referee's Suggested Failure to Deal with Arguable Points</b>
<P>

217	ADC's submissions in respect of this matter were set out in ADC's
submissions, paragraphs numbered 38 to 43 earlier set out
in paragraph 53 of
this Judgment.
<P>

218	The submission that the reference miscarried, or that the referee failed to
consider or deal with evidence supporting the WIL
submissions which the referee
adopted, namely that:
<P>

	(a)	ADC had time imperatives which made a hypothetical alternative contract
with ACT most likely.
<P>

	(b)	ADC had budgetary constraints such that it would not have been willing or
able to countenance prices for concrete that were
properly assessed and
viable,
<P>

	are in my view without substance.
<P>

219	As to the time imperatives issue, this was a matter put to the referee by
WIL.  The report sets out the relevant correspondence
running from late 1986 up
to February 1987 from prior to page 19 and from page 19 up to about page 46.
That correspondence includes,
as Mr Rayment pointed out in his submissions,
reference to the Notice given by the Department of Territories to ADC dated 21
November
1986, whereby the Commonwealth indicated that it intended in pursuance
of the powers contained in sub-clause 4(a) of the Crown Lease
to the property,
to determine the lease for failure to comply with the conditions contained in
sub-clause 2(c) of the lease.  The
correspondence includes reference in the 4
December 1986 letter from ADC to the Department of Territories, to ADC's
indication that
it was in a position to commence by 1 April 1987, providing it
received all necessary approvals from various Government Departments
and
instrumentalities in Canberra promptly.
<P>

220	At page 33 of the report, the referee set out detail of the new lease
granted to ADC with date of commencement on 24 December
1986 for a term of 96
years, which required commencement of the building to take place on or before
31 March 1987 with damages of
$1 million for failure to do so.
<P>

221	Clearly enough, the referee had before him, evidence to support his finding
that ADC had time imperatives which made a hypothetical
alternative contract
with ACT most likely.  It had been put to Mr Fischer in cross-examination (see
report page 57) that considerable
time pressure had been placed upon him and
paragraph 16 of his statement had been put to him where a reference was put to
him in
cross-examination that he had two minutes to midnight when the Company
might lose one million dollars.  To my mind, the submission
that the referee
failed to reveal his process of reasoning in the report on the topic of ADC's
time imperatives which made a hypothetical
alternative contract with ACT most
likely should be rejected, bearing in mind the detailed way in which the
referee, albeit by way
of adopting WIL's submissions, set out the reasoning
processes and factual matters supporting his relevant findings.
<P>

222	Nor do I accept that the process of reasoning by the referee in relation to
the finding that ADC had budgetary constraints such
that it would not have been
willing or able to countenance prices for concrete that were properly assessed
and viable is of substance.
 Here again, a careful reading of WIL's submissions
leading up to and following page 79 of the report, shows that the referee's
reasoning
was set out.
<P>

	<b>Conclusion as to ADC's Submission as to No Admissible Evidence or no
Sufficient Admissible Evidence</b>
<P>

223	In the result, I reject ADC's submission that there was either no
admissible evidence or no sufficient admissible evidence upon
which the referee
could have found that WIL would have consciously permitted its subsidiary to
enter into a hypothetical alternative
contract at a gross undervalue or that
ACT would have breached the hypothetical contract with the same consequences as
found in relation
to the actual contract.
<P>

	<b>Submissions as to the Precise Orders Which Should be Made</b>
<P>

224	I understand it to be common ground between both parties that as between
ADC and ACT, the referee treated the proceeding as
an ex-parte enquiry - ACT
having appeared albeit briefly on the first day of the reference, having
indicated that it was not proposing
to participate and then having departed.
<P>

225	In short, I understand both parties before me to accept that the referee in
his short report in relation to ADC's case against
ACT, did not take into
account and paid no regard at all except in one minor aspect, to the evidence
adduced by WIL or to the submissions
adduced by WIL, which evidence and
submissions of course were addressed on issues live between WIL and ADC.
<P>

226	Nothing in the short report by the referee in terms of ADC's case against
ACT could be said to answer or to deal with:
<P>

	(a)	any of the submissions which WIL made to the referee on damages, or
<P>

	(b)	any of the evidence adduced by WIL on quantum in the case litigated
between ADC and WIL.
<P>

227	Hence, the referee has never carried out assessment of damages as between
ADC and WIL in any respect, or purported to do so
by reference to his manner of
dealing with ADC's case against ACT.
<P>

228	There was, it seemed to me, some confusion as to precisely what Mr Rayment
would seek should ADC succeed in all or in part before
me.  At one level he
submitted that if the Court determined to adopt the report, then the suit
should be dismissed as against WIL
and ought make costs orders in favour of WIL
in terms of all costs of the proceedings including the Yeldham reference, all
sets of
proceedings before Giles J, the Morissey reference and these
proceedings as well as all reserved costs.
<P>

229	At another level, Mr Rayment at one stage submitted, as I understood him,
that bearing in mind the fifty days or thereabouts
of evidence adduced before
the referee and against the event that there may be an appeal, it was
appropriate for the referee, notwithstanding
his finding as against WIL of no
loss, to have also determined, were he wrong in his no loss decision, what was
the quantum of loss
or damage occasioned to ADC, and the question of when the
damage was suffered including the time bar issue.  Mr Rayment put that
the
referee should have determined these matters to avoid any prospect that after
successful appeals or ultimate appeals from the
referee's decision, those
matters would have to again be referred back to the referee.
<P>

230	Mr Gyles submitted that ADC accepted that technically, no finding of damage
or loss had been made against WIL by the referee.
 He submitted that if ADC
persuaded the Court that the report was flawed and that one or other of what
ADC put forward as the appropriate
bases for assessment of damages were
accepted by the Court, then ADC would wish to have the opportunity of
persuading the Court that
the material before the referee, and the referee's
findings in relation to ACT, at least gave a basis on which the Court could
itself
make the necessary decisions.  He accepted that there could not be said
to be any estoppel operating as against WIL in terms of the
material before the
referee and that there might need to be further evidence called before the
Court.
<P>

231	To my mind, the question whether there should be referred back to the
referee any matter other than that seeking the referee's
reasons relating to Mr
Huntstead's evidence referred to above, should presently be left open so that
counsel can address on those
matters, having had an opportunity to read this
judgment.
<P>

	<b>ADC's Case Against ACT</b>
<P>

232	Mr Rayment did not appear for ACT and did not therefore address any
submissions in relation to ADC's case against ACT.  He did,
however, submit
that if the Court determined to refer any matter back to the referee in
relation to ADC's case against WIL, then
it might be prudent to await
completion of the referee's further attention to those matters before entering
any judgment in favour
of ADC against ACT.  Here again, I will hear the parties
after they have had an opportunity to read this judgment in relation to
whether
either wishes to address any different submission as to what should now occur
with respect to ADC's claims against ACT.
