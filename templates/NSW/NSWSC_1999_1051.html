<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This litigation arose out of a dispute
relating to the construction of an Archbishop's residence, Cathedral School and
car parking
facility on a site adjoining St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney ("the
building project").  The plaintiff, Hughes Bros. Pty Limited ("HBL"),
commenced
proceedings by the filing of a Summons in the Construction List in August 1989.
Since then, the proceedings have become
complex, with the addition of parties
and claims and cross-claims.  There have been numerous Court hearings,
including two appeals
to the Court of Appeal and a rejected application for
special leave to appeal to the High Court.  There have been two lengthy
references
to a referee, Mr T M McDougall ("the Referee").  The Referee's
reports have been considered by the Court upon motions for their adoption,
with
the result that questions of liability as between the parties, quantum of
damages and interest on such damages have previously
been determined.  The
question before me is what orders should be made in relation to the costs of
the parties to the proceedings,
having regard to these prior determinations.  I
have found it necessary to consider the history of the proceedings, which is
long
and complex.  I set out, by way of background, what appear to be the
salient aspects of that history.
<P>

<b>HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</b>
<P>

2   	In August 1988, following a tendering process, HBL entered
into a written contract ("the written contract") with the first
defendant, The
Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney ("STM"), to
complete the building project for
a fixed sum of $18million.  The second
defendant, Kevin J Curtin &amp; Partners (Architects) Pty Limited ("KJC"), was
the architect
for the building works and the appointed superintendent under the
written contract.
<P>

3   	HBL's initial Summons, filed 9 August 1989, sought relief
entitling it to suspend the building works and requiring, <i>inter alia</i>,
that STM and KJC provide HBL with certain plans, drawings and other information
specified in paragraph 8 of the Summary of Plaintiff's
Contentions accompanying
the Summons.  Paragraph 10 of the Summary of Plaintiff's Contentions made the
following complaint:
<P>

<i>"The consequences of </i>[HBL]<i> not having these documents and information
are that it is unable to comply with its contractual obligations ... and is
being denied
the benefit of the contract."</i>
<P>

4   	Paragraph 10 then continued with seven particular
allegations as to how this was so.  Two paragraphs later there followed a
reference to repudiatory conduct:
<P>

<i>"In the absence of the documents and information referred to in paragraph 8,
</i>[KJC's]<i> direction </i>[requesting HBL to proceed with the works]<i> is a
requirement for </i>[HBL]<i> to perform work in a manner which is inconsistent
with the contract and which, if insisted upon by </i>[STM]<i>, would amount to
a repudiation of the contract by </i>[STM]<i>."</i>
<P>

5   	On 25 August 1989, HBL filed an Amended Summons in which,
<i>inter alia</i>, a declaration was sought that STM was obliged under its
building contract with HBL to appoint a reasonably competent superintendent
to
carry out its duties with reasonable diligence, skill and care.  A new issue
now considered likely to arise was <i>"</i>[w]<i>hether another person should
be appointed as the Superintendent"</i>.  Also, a new paragraph 8 was added to
the Plaintiff's Summary of Contentions which contended that, insofar as HBL was
aware, KJC
at the time of formation of the contract between HBL and STM to
complete the building project<b> </b>significantly amended the plans and
specifications for the building project that had previously been approved by
the Sydney City Council
without obtaining Council approval for these subsequent
changes.
<P>

6   	During September 1989, STM, in purported exercise of cl
44.1(a) of the written contract, took over the building works, excluded
HBL
from the site, and engaged another builder to complete the balance of the
works.  As grounds for the exclusion of HBL from the
building project, STM
asserted that the formwork subcontractor, Bimezi Constructions Pty Ltd
("Bimezi"), had brought proceedings
to wind up HBL.
<P>

7   	Following its exclusion from the building project, HBL
filed a Further Amended Summons dated 11 September 1989 by which the
proceedings were recast to challenge the validity of STM's conduct.  HBL now
sought remedies rendering STM's purported exercise of
cl 44 of the written
contract void and restraining STM or anyone else from excluding HBL from the
site, conducting works HBL contracted
with STM to perform on the building
project and interfering with HBL's building materials, tools, and equipment.
HBL also sought
a declaration that STM had not validly revoked HBL's licence to
go onto the site of the building project.  It also sought an order
restoring
HBL's full possession of the site for the purpose of completing the building
works.  Further or in the alternative HBL
claimed <i>"a declaration that
</i>[STM]<i> has repudiated the Contract".</i>
<P>

8   	On 21 September 1989, Giles J determined the questions
raised by the Further Amended Summons, except for the question of repudiation,
separately from the other issues in the proceedings (<b><i>Hughes Bros Pty Ltd
v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney
</i></b>(Giles J, 21 September 1989, unreported)).  His Honour held that STM's
exclusion of HBL was validly effected pursuant to cl 44 of
the written contract
and dismissed the claims for relief added by the Further Amended Summons save
for that portion dealing with
repudiation.  Part of his Honour's reasoning in
coming to this decision was his finding that an exercise of cl 44 of the
written
contract was not restricted by any implied obligation that the power
under cl 44.7 must be exercised reasonably.  His Honour ordered
HBL to pay the
costs of the determination.
<P>

9   	A notice of appeal from this determination was filed with
the Court of Appeal on 19 October 1989.  The proceedings were then
stood over
in the Construction List at various times to await the result of the Notice of
Appeal.
<P>

10   	On 17 May 1991, HBL filed in this Court a Second Further
Amended Summons pursuant to leave granted on that day by Brownie
J.  This
Amended Summons recast HBL's claim.  Now HBL as against STM claimed damages for
breach or repudiation of contract and sought
the value of excavations and other
variations to the work under the written contract carried out by HBL.  It also
sought an order
referring the proceedings in whole or in part to a referee, as
well as orders for interest and costs.  The breaches alleged against
STM were
that STM failed to ensure that KJC provided HBL with:  (1) relevant drawings,
information and approvals within a reasonable
time to complete the works and
comply with legislation;  (2) additional drawings within a reasonable time
after request; and (3)
all necessary directions regarding the performance of
the work by nominated sub-contractors or suppliers, for which provisional sums
were included in the written contract, and the selection and supply of
materials therefor.  HBL also claimed that STM breached its
obligations to
issue or cause to be issued copies of drawings, specifications and other
information, and its obligation to ensure
that KJC exercised its powers,
duties, discretions and authorities as superintendent fairly, reasonably and
with reasonable diligence,
care and skill.
<P>

11   	The excavations and variations arose out of HBL's
execution of works, upon the instruction of KJC as superintendent.  HBL
claimed
the value of these works which KJC, in breach of the written contract, had
failed to value.  HBL further claimed that STM
had breached a contractual
requirement to ensure earthworks were completed prior to HBL coming on to the
building site which, compounded
with HBL having to complete all or some of
those earthworks, resulted in delay and disruption to HBL's performance of the
written
contract.
<P>

12   	As against KJC, HBL claimed damages for breaches of duty
and negligence, for failure by KJC to perform those tasks STM contracted
with
HBL to ensure KJC would perform.
<P>

13   	On 2 July 1991, Staff AJ made an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 72</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a> ("SCR") referring the whole of the proceedings to
the Referee for inquiry and report.  The proceedings progressed slowly.  In the
interim, the building project was completed on 17 January 1992, costing STM in
excess of $34million.
<P>

14   	On 6 March 1992, Giles J ordered the parties to arrange a
conference with the Referee by not later than the end of March 1992
to discuss
a timetable and other arrangements. His Honour desired to appoint a date toward
the end of that month for the submission
of the Referee's report.  There
followed a number of notices of motion brought in relation to issues such as
discovery and security
for costs.
<P>

15   	HBL issued another Amended Summons on 10 March 1992.  This
amended pleading claimed an additional breach of contract being
that STM failed
to provide drawings to HBL, prior to the written contract being entered into,
which accurately described the work
to be carried out.  The Amended Summons
widened HBL's claim to include actions for misleading and deceptive conduct
pursuant to the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth)</i></b> and the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act 1987</a></i></b>, for representations of a continuing nature made by
STM and KJC to HBL, prior to entering into the written contract, that the
structural
design was complete or virtually complete and that structural
construction drawings would be released in a timely manner to facilitate
the
completion of the building project.  In relation to variations, HBL claimed it
was further entitled to payment in respect of
site allowances payable for the
works.  The Amended Summons also provided additional particulars of HBL's
claim.
<P>

16   	Ultimately, the parties, on 10 April 1992, arrived at a
timetable for proceeding with the matter.  The hearing before the
Referee was
scheduled to commence on 31 August 1992 and run for three months.  However, on
12 March 1992, the Court of Appeal handed
down its decision in <b><i>Renard
Construction (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR
234</a> which, even on a narrow view of it, implied into standard form building
contract NPWC Edition 3 (1981), the obligation to act reasonably
when seeking
to exercise a power of exclusion.  The written contract between HBL and STM was
in the same form.  Subsequently, the
Court of Appeal granted HBL leave to
appeal against the decision of Giles J of 21 September 1989.  The hearing of
the reference was
postponed and the matter was variously stood over for
directions, pending the decision of the Court of Appeal.
<P>

17   	The Court of Appeal gave its decision on 15 July 1993
dismissing the appeal: <b><i>Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Trustees of the Roman
Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 91.</a>  A
majority of the Court of Appeal (Kirby P, Priestley JA, Meagher JA (dissenting
in part)) held that there was an implied obligation
to exercise reasonably a
power of exclusion under cl 44 of the written contract.  For example, Kirby P
(as he then was) states at
p 93:
<P>

<i>"The decision of the primary judge (Giles J) was given before Renard was
decided.  It appears that his Honour was following an approach
to the NPWC
contract common in the Commercial Division at the time before the decision in
Renard established the contrary."</i>
<P>

18   	However, the majority reached the view that STM was not in
breach of the obligation of reasonableness and had therefore rightfully
excluded HBL from the building project.  As Kirby P explained at p 94:
<P>

<i>"Most relevant to my conclusion </i>[that STM acted reasonably in excluding
HBL]<i> is the fact that nominated sub-contractors had not been paid by
</i>[HBL]<i>, statutory demands had been served upon it and winding up
proceedings were on foot ...The </i>[written contract]<i> gave </i>[STM]<i> the
right, after affording </i>[HBL]<i> the opportunity to show cause within a
specified period, to act as </i>[STM]<i> acted here."</i>
<P>

19   	HBL subsequently applied for special leave to appeal to
the High Court.  The matter was stood over in the Construction List
until 6 May
1994 to await the outcome of that application.
<P>

20   	On 11 April 1994, HBL's application for special leave to
appeal was refused.  In the following eighteen months, cross-claims
were
instituted, witness statements were filed and served and general preparations
were made for the hearing of the reference.  Numerous
interlocutory
applications were brought including an application to strike out certain
paragraphs of the Amended Summons and for
separate determination of the
proceedings.  This was heard before Giles J (<b><i>Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v
Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney</i></b>
(Giles J, 30 March 1995, unreported)).  In that decision, Giles J dismissed,
<i>inter alia, </i>a Notice of Motion brought by STM seeking to strike out of
HBL's Summons certain paragraphs which were, in essence, a claim for damages
by
HBL equivalent to the difference between the amount HBL would have been paid
had it completed the project and the certified cost
to STM of actually
completing the project, which was an item STM was seeking to claim against
HBL.
<P>

21   	On 3 June 1994, KJC brought the First Cross-Claim against
Morrison Whitten &amp; Nicey Pty Ltd ("MWN"), the engineer for the
building
project.  The cross-claim sought contribution from MWN, as joint tortfeasor,
should it be determined that KJC was liable
to HBL in negligence.  KJC alleged
that MWN, by failing to fulfil agreements it made with STM to provide
structural engineering services
and engineering drawings for the building
project, breached certain duties it owed HBL to provide the contractor with
structural
drawings, directions and other information to enable it to complete
the building project.  KJC also claimed that MWN had made a number
of negligent
misrepresentations to KJC which were the basis for representations HBL alleged
KJC had made to it.  Finally KJC pleaded
that MWN negligently breached its duty
to provide KJC with engineering drawings and other information within a
reasonable time during
the course of the building project.
<P>

22   	On 20 June 1994, STM brought a Second Cross-Claim against
HBL.  STM claimed against HBL, in essence, damages for losses caused
by
breaches of contract and/or misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>
of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth)</i></b> for representations made by
HBL prior to acceptance of its tender for the building project.  A claim was
made, with reference to
cl 44.4 of the written contract, for a contractual
payment of the difference between the certified actual cost of the works to STM
and the amount HBL would have been paid had it completed the building project
("the difference").  STM also sought payment of liquidated
damages for the
period from 6 February 1990, the date specified in the written contract for
completion of works by HBL, to 17 January
1992, the date upon which the
building project was actually completed.  STM's cross-claim was in excess of
$18million.
<P>

23   	STM also instituted a Third Cross-Claim against KJC.  In
its final form, this Cross-claim sought from KJC indemnity or contribution,
as
joint tortfeasor, for damages payable by STM should it be held that STM was
liable to HBL.  Further or in the alternative, STM
claimed against KJC damages
for any losses of HBL for which STM should be found to be liable and which
arose out of acts of negligence
by KJC as architect and superintendent.
<P>

24   	The hearing of the reference finally commenced on 3
October 1995.  During the hearing, a dispute arose as to the hearing of
the
question of interest.  It eventuated that the Referee delivered two reports:
one covering the whole of the proceedings except
for interest ("the Referee's
original report") and a second inquiring into the question of interest ("the
Referee's second report").
<P>

25   	Also, the Referee, on 12 October 1995, granted HBL leave
to file and serve a Further Amended Summons.  This was the final
Summons relied
upon.  It amended the previous Summons by formally claiming damages against STM
and KJC for breaches of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>
(Cth)</i></b> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a></i></b>, which were
contained in the Summary of Plaintiff's Contentions in the previous Summons,
and provided further particulars.  HBL also
expanded its claims in relation to
variations and excavation work seeking the costs of further alleged variations
to the written
contract by KJC and STM and claiming that such variations and
delays in excavations entitled HBL to an extension of time for the
completion
of the works.
<P>

26   	A useful summary of the conduct of the reference is
contained in STM's written submissions in these proceedings:
<P>

<i>"3 October 1995	Commencement of reference.</i>
<P>

<i>9 October 1995	Plaintiff seeks leave to amend Further Amended Statement of

<P>

27   	The adoption of the first report was considered by this
Court over four days in March 1997 by Giles CJ of CommD (as he then
was):
<b><i>Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the
Archdiocese of Sydney</i></b> (Giles CJ CommD, 16 October 1997, unreported).
HBL sought the adoption of the Referee's original report <i>"with modest
exceptions"</i> while STM and KJC opposed the adoption of the report <i>"in
different and substantial respects and on different grounds"</i>.  The
Referee's original report was adopted by the Court with some significant
variations.  The decision of 16 October 1997 had the
following results:

28   	<b>(1)</b>	HBL had substantial success upon the further
amended summons.  Although it failed completely in relation to the claims for
misleading
and deceptive conduct it was awarded $1,979,633.72 for work done,
excavations/variations and damages for breach of contract.  The
breaches of
contract by STM, committed prior to the exclusion of HBL from the building
project, were held to be, <i>inter alia</i>, that the building site was
insufficiently prepared for HBL to engage in construction work and that HBL was
not given sufficient
documentation properly to perform the works (judgment at
pp 28-54).  It was noted that STM had validly excluded HBL from the building
project but that the underlying cause of such exclusion was that HBL was
suffering a liquidity problem.  It was further held that
STM's breaches had
causally contributed to HBL's liquidity problems (see, eg, pp 49 and 53 of the
judgment).  His Honour, therefore,
adopted the Referee's finding that STM's
breach of contract causally contributed to HBL's liability to pay STM "the
difference".
<P>

29   	As STM had validly excluded HBL from the project, STM was
entitled upon the Second Cross-Claim to "the difference".  His Honour
set off
this award against HBL's entitlements under the Further Amended Summons
including its successful claim for the same amount.
 STM failed on all other
grounds of the Second Cross-Claim.  Accordingly, STM achieved no real success
in pursuing the second cross-claim.
 His Honour stated the final outcomes of
the Further Amended Summons and Second Cross-Claim as follows (at p 86):
<P>

<i>"... as between HBL and STM HBL is entitled to judgment for $6,856,565.51 on
the further amended summons and STM is entitled to judgment
for $4,876,931.79
on the second cross-claim:  unless it be submitted to the contrary, these
amounts should be set off against each
other to result in one judgment for
$1,979,633.72 in favour of HBL."</i>
<P>

30   	I note that the award of $1,979,633.79 was later
discovered to contain a mathematical error and was corrected on 27 May 1998
to
judgment for $2,024,168.22 in favour of HBL on the Further Amended Summons.
<P>

31   	I further note that in relation to the time taken at the
hearing of the reference in respect of the claims for misleading
and deceptive
conduct in the Further Amended Summons Giles J (at p 71) stated:
<P>

<i>"The referee made no findings as to how HBL relied on the representations in
entering into the contract.  It was common ground that
HBL had not called
evidence from anyone responsible on its side for entry into the contract, and
at one point before me it was said
that <b>"the whole <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> case received the
scantiest of attention"</b>.  That seems borne out by the manner it was dealt
with in the report."</i>
<P>

32   	<b>(2)</b>	As between HBL and KJC judgment was awarded to
KJC on the further amended summons.  The report as varied and adopted by the
Court
upheld that HBL failed completely in its claims against KJC.  Giles J (at
p 63) said:
<P>

<i>"In para BB 48 the referee ascribed responsibility for the slow delivery of
drawings "primarily" to STM, together with "some" responsibility
for the
inadequacy of the tender documentation.  It is unclear whether KJC, MWN or
someone else had the secondary and other responsibilities."</i>
<P>

33   	<b>(3)</b>	As between STM and KJC on the Third
Cross-Claim, judgment was awarded to KJC.  STM completely failed in its claim.
Though it was
not decided it may be noted that Giles J (at pp 74-75) indicated
that STM's claim for indemnity or contribution from KJC, as a joint
tortfeasor,
pursuant to s 5 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
1946</a></i></b> might not have been available, having regard to the causes of
action pleaded in the Further Amended Summons.
<P>

34   	At this point, it is necessary to consider events in
relation to the First Cross-Claim, between KJC and MWN, which, in the
circumstances of the case, was before his Honour in only a limited way.  On 23
August 1995 MWN sent a letter to KJC containing an
offer of compromise of the
First Cross-Claim ("the first offer of compromise").  This offer was not
accepted by KJC.  It was made
approximately five weeks before commencement of
the hearing of the reference.
<P>

35   	One month after the commencement of the reference hearing
Hunter J heard an application by MWN seeking security for its costs
from KJC:
<b><i>Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the
Archdiocese of Sydney</i></b> (Hunter J, 7 November 1995, unreported).  At that
time KJC was <i>"hopelessly insolvent"</i>.  Its legal costs were being funded
by its professional indemnity insurer and that insurance cover provided its
only capacity to
meet an order for costs against it.  There were also concerns
that the professional indemnity insurer might abandon its support of
KJC in the
litigation.  In these circumstances, Hunter J made a conditional order, that if
MWN renewed its offer of compromise to
KJC and such offer was not accepted,
then security for costs in the sum of $250,000 was to be provided by KJC within
fourteen days
of the expiration of such renewed offer.  If the security for
costs was not provided, then the proceedings on the First Cross-Claim
would be
stayed.  It was further ordered that the renewed offer be in the same terms as
the first offer of compromise, except that
it was not to impose any requirement
upon KJC in respect of costs of MWN incurred since 23 August 1995.
<P>

36   	In consequence of these orders, MWN on 10 November 1995
forwarded to KJC a second offer of compromise ("the second offer of
compromise").  This was not accepted, security for costs was not paid by KJC
and, consequently, the proceedings on the first-cross
claim were stayed with
effect from 5pm, Friday 7 December 1995.
<P>

37   	In relation to the stay of proceedings the Referee noted
the following (at para B52 of Volume 1 of the original report):
<P>

<i>"Consequently the hearing proceeded after 7 December 95 on the basis of the
HBL further amended summons, ie. "main" claim and the
second and amended third
cross-claims only, and all evidence taken in the hearing relates to these
matters."</i>
<P>

38   	In the present proceedings KJC submits that the first and
second offers of compromise were not valid "Calderbank" and could
have no
effect in relation to the imposition of an indemnity costs order.  I examine
the validity of this submission latter in these
reasons.
<P>

39   	On 5 December 1997 Giles J ordered that KJC's cross-claim
against MWN be dismissed.  The question of costs was reserved.
<P>

40   	I return, then, to the history of the proceedings.  The
question of interest on damages was referred back to the Referee for
further
hearing.  He furnished his report to the Court on 31 August 1998.  By the
decision of Rolfe J of 10 December 1998 the Referee's
second report was adopted
(<b><i>Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the
Archdiocese of Sydney</i></b> (Rolfe J, 10 December 1998, unreported)).  I note
that the Referee's second report concluded at p 33:
<P>

<i>"It is my view that interest on the full judgment amount of $2,024,168.22
should be calculated on the <b>Hungerfords v Walker </b>basis, using ANZ
overdraft rates up to 22 December 89 and SBNSW rates thereafter.  Allowance
should be made for the fact that all
but $44,534.50 of this amount was paid on
22 December 97."</i>
<P>

41   	The outstanding $44,534.50 was paid by STM to HBL on 23
June 1998.  This amount and the payments of 22 December 1997 were
paid as
interim payments pursuant to s 76E of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a></i></b>.
By order of Rolfe J on 11 December 1998 judgment, inclusive of interest
thereon, was entered for HBL against STM in the sum of $5,859,671.95.
<P>

42   	On 24 December 1998 STM filed and served a notice of
appeal from the decision of Giles CJ Comm D of 16 October 1997 as to
the
adoption of the Referee's original report, the interlocutory judgment of his
Honour of 14 November 1997 restricting the scope
of cross-examination on
interest and from Rolfe J's decision of 10 December 1998 regarding adoption of
the Referee's second report.
 The appeal is currently awaiting hearing in the
general list of the Court of Appeal.
<P>

43   	It is in the context of this long history of litigation
that the question of costs came before me on 28 July 1999.  I turn
now to the
substantive arguments raised by the parties as to the appropriate orders for
costs in these proceedings, to the extent
that such orders have not previously
been made, and the issue of interest payable upon such costs.
<P>

<b>COSTS AS BETWEEN HBL AND STM</b>
<P>

44   	HBL seeks an order that STM pay its costs of the Further
Amended Summons and the Second Cross-Claim up to and including 12
August 1996
on a party/party basis and thereafter on an indemnity basis, as a result of the
non-acceptance of a Calderbank offer.
 It submits that the Further Amended
Summons and Second Cross-Claim involved issues which <i>"were bound together in
the factual matrix of the case"</i> and that the results in respect of each
should not be viewed in isolation.  On this basis, it is submitted that it
would be inappropriate
for separate costs orders to be made in respect of the
Summons and the Cross-Claim.
<P>

45   	The further submission is made that insofar as HBL was
successful on the majority of the claims it pursued against STM, it
would be
inappropriate to make separate costs orders relating to specific issues.
Reliance is placed upon statements made in the
judgments of the Court of Appeal
in <b><i>Waters v B P C Henderson (Australia) Pty Ltd</i></b> (Kirby P, Mahoney
and Priestley JJA, CA40678/91, 6 July 1994, unreported).  The appeal was from a
decision by Cole J in the Commercial
Division in which there had been a
reference to a referee.  It was not a construction case but was a dispute
involving a number of
issues.  Each party was partly successful in relation to
matters that were before the Referee.  Cole J had treated the matter as
if it
were <i>"a construction dispute"</i> and had said <i>"it is simply not
possible, nor would it be efficient for the Court to seek to isolate each of
the multitudinous issues which arise
in construction disputes and try and make
an appropriate order for costs in respect of each particular item"</i>.
Mahoney JA (at p 3) indicated that he did not <i>"differ from </i>(Cole J)<i>
in relation to the principle in question"</i>.  His Honour went on to say (at
pp 3-4):
<P>

<i>"In the present case, it has been submitted, in effect, that the reason why
the Court should intervene is that different parties were
successful in
relation to different issues or successful to different degrees and that the
judge should, therefore, have differentiated
between the different issues and
made different orders as to costs.</i>
<P>

<i>It was suggested that the matter could be divided into three or four
separate issues and orders made accordingly, and that the judge
was wrong in
dealing with the matter as if there were numerous issues.</i>
<P>

<i>In my opinion the principles in this regard are properly stated in the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> and Rules.  S76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> provides that the
Court has a discretion with full power to determine by whom and to what extent
costs are to be paid.  In the Rules,
Pt52 R11 provides that:</i>
<P>

<i>`If the Court makes any order as to costs, the Court shall, subject to this
Part, order that the costs follow the event, except where
it appears to the
Court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the
costs.'</i>
<P>

<i>In the notes to the Rules, Pt52.11.2, the following appears:</i>
<P>

<i>`Where the proceedings involve multiple issues the application of the rule
that costs follow the event may involve hardship where
a party succeeds on some
issues and yet fails on others.  Particularly is this so where, for example, a
defendant succeeds on issues
that occupied the bulk of the time taken by the
proceedings.  Nevertheless unless a particular issue or group of issues is
clearly
dominant or separable it will ordinarily be appropriate to award the
costs of the proceedings to the successful party without attempting
to
differentiate between those particular issues on which it was successful and
those on which it failed.'</i>
<P>

<i>Reference is made to cases, some of which I have considered.  They appear
generally to support the principle which is stated in the
Practice.  I think
that was the principle to which his Honour had regard in the present
case.</i>
<P>

<i>I do not think that it would have been appropriate for his Honour to attempt
to determine which issues were won by particular parties,
to what extent they
were won, and what was the amount of time spent on each of the issues so as to
apportion costs accordingly. 
I think that would have been contrary to the
trend of decision in relation to the exercise of discretion as to
costs."</i>
<P>

46   	HBL relies upon these principles, whilst acknowledging
that it failed on a large number of the claims that it brought.  On
the other
hand, STM submits that HBL should not be awarded its costs in respect of the
claims upon which it was unsuccessful or in
respect of which it substantially
lost.  In the affidavit evidence before me, both HBL and STM produced schedules
indicating claims
made, together with the success or failure of those claims.
It may be noted that the schedules did not completely agree.  This very
fact,
in my view, indicates the propriety of following the principles outlined above
in the present case.  I decline to make any
orders based upon success or
failure of either party in respect of particular issues.
<P>

47   	I have set out above the passage from the judgment of
Giles CJ Comm D, where his Honour sets off the amount established by
STM in its
cross-claim against the amount established by HBL in its claim, resulting in
the balance awarded to HBL.  For HBL, it
is submitted that I should treat this
result as being, in effect, an overall verdict in favour of HBL which would
carry with it,
the costs of the claim and cross-claim.  On behalf of STM,
however, it is submitted that, as the cross-claim was partially successful,
the
whole or part of the costs of the cross-claim should be awarded to STM.  This
argument, as developed, related to <i>"the difference"</i>.  STM had obtained a
relevant certificate indicating that the costs of completion of the building
project after the exclusion of
HBL from the site had exceeded the contract
price for which HBL was to complete the work by an amount of some $16million.
This amount
was claimed in the Second Cross-Claim as damages pursuant to cl 44
of the written contract.  To this claim, HBL raised two defences:
(a) any
amount recoverable by STM from it, in this regard, was ultimately attributable
to breaches by STM of the written contract
which had resulted in HBL's
inability to pay its sub-contractor, with the result that any amount
established in this Cross-Claim
would become part of HBL's damages recoverable
against STM in its claim; (b) the costs of completion were excessive.
<P>

48   	In the result, HBL succeeded in respect of defence (a) and
was substantially successful in defence (b) in that it was determined
that the
reasonable cost of completion was in the order of $4million.  It is clear that
a substantial number of hearing days in the
reference were taken up in
determining the issues involved in defence (b).  It was submitted that, in the
light of HBL's success
in defence (a), these days were wasted because HBL was
merely engaging in some sort of <i>"frolic"</i>, insofar as whatever was to be
awarded to STM on the Second Cross-Claim, the identical amount was to be
recovered against it by HBL
on the claim.  Accordingly, it was submitted on
behalf of STM, it should have the whole of the costs of the Second Cross-Claim,
including,
as I understand it, the costs of items in respect of which it
failed.
<P>

49   	In my view, there is no substance in this submission.
Although HBL was successful in respect of defence (a), the point was
not
conceded, it being argued that, as a matter of construction of cl 44 and in the
events which happened, HBL was not entitled to
claim <i>"the difference"</i> as
damages against STM.  Indeed, I was advised, during the hearing, that this
point will be argued on appeal.  Consequently, it was,
in my view, entirely
reasonable that HBL should call evidence and raise arguments directed to
reducing the amount claimed as <i>"the difference"</i>.
<P>

50   	I am satisfied that the issues of the Further Amended
Summons and the Second Cross-Claim were in fact so intertwined as to
make it
reasonable to follow, in respect of the costs orders, what was done by his
Honour, in respect of the award of damages, namely,
to regard the balance in
favour of HBL as being the final result in its favour.  In such circumstances,
it is, in my view, inappropriate
to make separate costs orders in respect of
claim and cross-claim.  Subject to the question of indemnity costs resulting
from a Calderbank
offer, I am satisfied that STM should pay HBL's costs of the
Further Amended Summons and the Second Cross-Claim.  I turn then to
consider
the Calderbank offer.
<P>

51   	On 12 August 1996, HBL made an offer of compromise within
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r 22(4) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a></i></b>, to STM.  The offer was
that HBL would accept the sum of $370,000 together with costs to be agreed or
assessed.  There was some discussion
between the solicitors as to the amount of
costs.  It appears that these discussions went nowhere.  However, in my view,
the offer
remained open.  In the absence of agreement as to the amount of
costs, the plaintiff was prepared to accept an assessment in accordance
with
the Rules.
<P>

52   	The offer was made in the form of a Calderbank letter.  No
point is taken as to there being any technical deficiency in the
making of the
offer.  In my view, it is correctly stated, in the written submission of HBL,
that:
<P>

<i>"As an incentive to making and accepting offers of compromise, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r
22(4) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a> </b>provides that where a Plaintiff makes
an offer not accepted by the Defendant, and the Plaintiff obtains a judgment no
less favourable
that that offer, then, unless the Court otherwise orders, the
Plaintiff is entitled to costs from the Defendant on an indemnity basis
from
the date on which the offer was made, and costs on a party/party basis before
the date of that offer."</i>
<P>

53   	There can be no doubt that the plaintiff's offer was far
more favourable to the first defendant than the judgment ultimately
entered
against it in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $5,859,671.95.
<P>

54   	The principles in relation to the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r
22(4) were considered by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Maitland Hospital v
Fisher [No.2]</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 721.</a>  The Court said (at p 725):
<P>

<i>"The decision to award or withhold indemnity costs where a plaintiff's
settlement offer has been made but not accepted, involves a
discretion to be
exercised by reference to all of the circumstances of the case, not by applying
a fixed mathematical formula.</i>
<P>

<i>... The rule does no more than to oblige litigants, and those advising them,
to consider realistically, upon the best information
available to them, the
prospects of success and the likely outcome of the litigation.  Where, in the
particular circumstances, the
litigant or its advisers mis-judge the prospects
of success or mis-calculate the outcome, their mistake may be warranted on the
material
which they had available.  Alternatively, it may be no more than a
mis-calculation in a case with large imponderables where the course
they took
was nonetheless perfectly reasonable.  Litigation is inescapably chancy.  The
purpose of the rule is to put a premium on
realistic assessment of cases.  It
is not to demand perfect foresight which is denied even to the judges.  That is
why a discretion
is retained, under the rule, for the Court to order otherwise
than as the rule provides.  But the ordinary provision is expected
to apply in
the ordinary case."</i>
<P>

55   	Obviously, a number of discretionary matters enter into
the awarding of costs on an indemnity basis.  In the present case,
it is
obvious that the proceedings were extremely complex, and, no doubt, the
situation at the completion of the reference was very
far from clear.  However,
the offer that was made was pitched at a level, having regard to the ultimate
outcome, that clearly required
that it be given very serious consideration.  So
far as the evidence indicates, it was brushed aside on the basis that no
agreement
could be reached as to a proper figure for costs.  Having regard to
the obvious purpose of the provision, I am satisfied that this
is an
appropriate case for its discretionary application.  I can see no sufficient
reason, consistent with that purpose, for the
rejection of the offer.
Accordingly, costs will be ordered on an indemnity basis from the time of its
making.
<P>

56   	The next question to be considered is whether an order, in
the nature of a Sanderson or Bullock order should be made in favour
of the
plaintiff against the first defendant in respect of the costs of the second
defendant.  HBL, the plaintiff, failed in its
action instituted by the Further
Amended Summons against the second defendant, KJC.  There is no apparent reason
why, in these circumstances,
HBL should not be liable to KJC for its costs of
defending HBL's action.  The question is whether HBL is entitled to an order
requiring
that, directly or indirectly, STM pay those costs.  The principle is
quite clear.  The question is whether, in the circumstances,
it was reasonable
for HBL to sue KJC.  It may be noted that it did not take this course at a late
stage in the proceedings, KJC having
been included as a defendant in earlier
manifestations of HBL's Summons.
<P>

57   	KJC was the architect with the responsibility for the
building project and was also the superintendent of that project, appointed
under the written contract.  As I understand it, it is STM's contention that
there was no necessity for HBL to join KJC because KJC
was acting, in all
respects, as HBL's agent with the result that, if KJC was guilty of any
breaches of duty to HBL, then STM would
be liable to HBL as principal.  Having
regard to the complex issues of this litigation, not only initially but as they
developed,
I am quite satisfied that this contention is no answer to HBL's
claim.  Although, with hindsight, especially having regard to the
fact that HBL
ultimately failed against KJC, it might be said that there was in fact no need
to make the joinder, I am not persuaded
that it was anything but reasonable on
the part of HBL to sue KJC.  Admittedly, there was no privity of contract
between them, but
KJC had professional duties at common law and, arguably, had
made representations, referred to in the pleadings, pursuant to the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth)</i></b> and the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a></i></b>.
I am satisfied that it was reasonable for HBL to have taken the proceedings
against KJC and for the Court to make appropriate orders
for the payment to KJC
by STM of its costs of defending the action.
<P>

58   	It has been made clear in these proceedings that HBL is
not in a sound financial situation.  In my opinion, it would be unsatisfactory
to make a Bullock type order in these circumstances.  Accordingly, I find that
it is appropriate that a Sanderson type order be made.
 This will be reflected
in the orders that I ultimately make.
<P>

59   	I should add that I accept the plaintiff's submissions
that it was inevitable, having regard to the overall factual matrix
of this
matter that HBL would join KJC, as it in fact did.  In those circumstances,
having regard to the fact that the plaintiff's
claims against both defendants,
stated generally, were that there was a failure to prepare the site and
provide, in an appropriately
timely manner, the relevant and necessary
documentation, the joinder of both in the one proceedings was appropriate.
<P>

60   	The next question to be considered is whether I should
make an appropriate order providing for the payment by STM of interest
upon the
costs awarded to HBL and KJC.  In this regard, I am satisfied that s 95(4) of
the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a></i></b> and also s 76 of that Act enables the
making of such an order.  I am satisfied that s 95(4) can and should be given
retrospection
operation  The principles upon which such an order may be made
are, in my view, founded upon common sense and justice.  In circumstances
where
a successful party has outlaid, from an early stage and often continuously,
amounts of money, by way of payments to his legal
representatives to finance
the conduct of the litigation, he will, manifestly, be significantly out of
pocket if he receives, by
way of reimbursement of his payments, only an amount
of taxed or assessed costs at a far later stage, after he has successfully
prosecuted
the litigation to finality.  Such a financial detriment can only be
compensated by the making of an appropriate award of interest
to be paid in
respect of those payments, providing, of course, that the relevant payments can
be properly allocated to the successful
outcome of the litigation in whole or
in part.  I consider that the foregoing is the effect of statements made by
Rogers CJ Comm
D in <b><i>McWilliams Wines Pty Ltd v Liaweena</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32
NSWLR 190.</a>
<P>

61   	I do not understand there to be, in these proceedings, any
contest as to the existence of these principles.  However, it has
been asserted
that no order should be made at the present stage because, in the nature of
things, no precise orders as to the payment
of costs and the amount of such
costs can be made.  Such precision must await the attention of an Assessor
appointed pursuant to
the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a></i></b>.  The
contention advanced on behalf of STM is that the question of interest must
await the primary determination of the Assessor
as to the amount of costs
payable by STM.  Only after appropriate costs orders are made can the matter be
returned to this Court
for the consideration of appropriate orders for interest
to be made in respect of those orders.  I do not accept this submission.
 If
accepted, it would lead to quite unnecessary delay which would be inimical to
the policy of the Construction List, which requires
that all aspects of
litigation be determined as quickly as reasonably possible.
<P>

62   	The affidavit of Darrell Hendry filed on behalf of the
plaintiff, the admissibility of which was deferred for consideration
in these
reasons, is, in my view, admissible to demonstrate that HBL has since 1989 paid
significant amounts on account of costs
to its legal representatives.  The
affidavit does not indicate the way in which individual payments can be
ascribed to particular
areas of the litigation.  It may well be that an
Assessor will have to determine whether particular amounts are properly
recoverable
and therefore susceptible to an order for interest.  I am
satisfied, however, that this does not present any impediment to my making,
for
the guidance of an Assessor, an order that interest should be payable, where
appropriate, upon amounts of costs paid by HBL to
its legal representatives
from 1989 onwards.  It may well be that evidence will be required to assist the
Assessor in making appropriate
decisions.  I do not think it desirable that I
say anything further on this aspect.  I propose, however, to make what I
consider
to be an appropriate order in relation to the payment of interest.  I
should add that these considerations apply as well to applications
for interest
made by other successful parties in this litigation.
<P>

63   	So far as the proceedings between HBL and STM are
concerned, there remains for consideration three submissions raised by STM.
 I
shall deal with them in order.
<P>

64   	The first is a submission that a cost order favourable to
STM should be made in respect of the number of earlier Summonses
issued by HBL
in these proceedings.  The blanket submission was made that between the
commencement of the proceedings in 1988 and
the commencement of the reference,
HBL should have been able to get its pleadings in order.  Its failure to do so
occasioned costs
to STM in relation to the consideration, by its legal
advisers, of earlier abandoned or modified pleadings.  I am not prepared to
accede to this submission.  Whilst it is true that HBL's pleadings underwent
many changes and modifications, they did so in the context
of the development
of the dispute between the parties as detailed earlier in these reasons.  It is
to be remembered that significant
changes in that dispute occurred when STM
took steps to exclude HBL from the site of the building project.  Applications
to the Court
and consequent appeals, in my view, altered the litigious
landscape significantly, requiring appropriate changes to be made in the
shape
of the litigation.  I do not see any satisfactory basis upon which the orders
sought by STM can be made.  I refuse them.
<P>

65   	The next submission by STM is that it should be awarded
the costs of one and a half days of hearing occurring shortly after
the
commencement of the reference, during which amendments sought by HBL to its
Summons were the subject of debate.  These amendments
were allowed in part.
The Referee, who acknowledged that he had no power to make any order for costs,
indicated that, in his view,
it was an appropriate occasion for the costs
occasioned by the amendment to be awarded to the other parties.  I mean no
disrespect
to the learned Referee when I say, as he himself acknowledged, that
his remarks in this regard can have no binding effect upon this
Court.  Having
regard to the lengthy and complex history of the litigation, I would not be
prepared to make such an order unless
it was demonstrated to me that it was, in
all the circumstances, appropriate.  No such demonstration has been occurred.
I refuse
to make the order.
<P>

66   	A further submission was made, based upon remarks made by
the Referee at the conclusion of the hearing before him.  These
were to the
effect that, in his view, justice would be done if all parties <i>"walked
away"</i> from the litigation and paid their own costs.  It appears to have
been submitted, but faintly, that I should base some costs order
upon this
expression of view.  That is not possible.  I also reject this submission.
<P>

<b>COSTS AS BETWEEN STM AND KJC OF THIRD CROSS-CLAIM</b>
<P>

67   	KJC obtained judgment against STM on the Third
Cross-Claim.  It would appear that STM failed against KJC on the same basis
that HBL failed.  I consider that KJC is entitled to an order for costs against
STM in respect of the Third Cross-Claim.  However,
I would expect that it would
recover very little under this order as there must be an avoidance of
duplication between the costs
recovered under this order and those recovered
against HBL and payable by STM via the Sanderson order to be pronounced.
<P>

68   	In my view, it is appropriate that I make an order that
interest be payable in respect of these costs.
<P>

<b>COSTS AS BETWEEN KJC AND MWN OF THE FIRST CROSS-CLAIM</b>
<P>

69   	As already indicated, KJC's Cross-Claim against MWN was
ultimately dismissed after its having been stayed by order of Hunter
J.  MWN,
accordingly, seeks an order for costs against KJC.  It seeks that part of its
costs be paid on an indemnity basis because
of non-acceptance of a Calderbank
offer made by it.  KJC does not dispute that there should be an order for costs
but asserts that
it should not be required to pay any part of the costs on an
indemnity basis.  I shall consider this matter later.  However, KJC
asserts
against STM that it should be the recipient of a Sanderson type order in
relation to the costs payable by it to MWN.  It
seeks that STM be ordered to
pay those costs directly to MWN.
<P>

70   	I consider that KJC is entitled to a Sanderson type order.
It was joined in the proceedings, not only by its being an original
defendant
to the Further Amended Summons brought by HBL, but also by way of the Third
Cross-Claim brought by STM against it.  The
main thrust of the plaintiff's
claim against STM related to failure to have the site ready for HBL to commence
the building project
and also failure to supply to HBL, in a complete and
timely fashion, the documentation to which reference has already been made.
This claim had been <i>"passed on"</i> to KJC on the basis that it had both a
common law and contractual duty to see that these matters were attended to,
arising from its
position as architect and superintendent for the project.  KJC
had no contract with MWN which contracted directly with STM.  However,
it was
asserted that MWN had the responsibility of providing engineering drawings,
including drawings referred to as <i>"structural"</i> drawings, in a timely
fashion.  It was KJC's contention that it had failed in this responsibility.
It, therefore, joined MWN claiming
indemnity and/or contribution from it
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
1946</a></i></b>.  I am satisfied that this was a reasonable course for KJC to
follow.  It is, therefore, in my opinion, entitled to a Sanderson type
order
against STM requiring the latter to pay directly to MWN the amount of its costs
(subject to any modifications resulting from
the Calderbank offer).  I consider
that a Sanderson type order should be made rather than a Bullock order.  The
latter order, would,
in the circumstances of this case, lead to unnecessary
costs and delay.  I turn, then, to a consideration of MWN's Calderbank
offer.
<P>

71   	MWN, in fact, made two such offers.  The first on 23
August 1995 before the commencement of the reference and the second on
10
November 1995, as a result of the orders of Hunter J referred to above.  The
offers were made by letters which were in identical
terms, the relevant portion
being as follows:
<P>

<i>"... we are instructed to make the following offer of settlement.  In return
for a verdict and judgement being entered in MWN's favour
on the Cross-Claim
filed by Curtin against MWN, MWN agrees to:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Pay to Curtin the sum of $50,000.00  This sum represents what we consider
to be the costs incurred by Curtin to date on the Cross-Claim
calculated on a
party/party basis.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, in the event that a judgment is entered
against Curtin in the proceedings, MWN agrees to contribute
to that judgment
the first $425,000.00 in satisfaction of, but not exceeding, such a judgment.
However, MWN will only contribute
to a judgment where the loss to which such a
judgment applies arose from the alleged failure of MWN to provide structural
documents
as pleaded in the Amended Summons filed by HB in the
proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	In the event that a dispute arises in respect of any matter referred to
in paragraph 2 between Curtin and MWN following a judgment,
such dispute will
be referred to the referee in the proceedings for his determination, which
determination will be final and binding
on both Curtin and MWN.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	In the event that HB and/or the Church rejoins MWN to the proceedings, or
in the event that HB and/or the Church commence separate
proceedings against
MWN which involve the same or substantially the same facts and circumstances
surrounding the proceedings, paragraphs
2 and 3 will have no effect and will be
deemed never to have had any effect.</i>
<P>

<i>This offer is conditional upon Curtin agreeing to enter into a Deed of
Release to be drafted by us.</i>
<P>

<i>This offer will remain open for 14 days from the date of this letter.</i>
<P>

<i>In the event that this offer is not accepted and Curtin obtains a judgment
or order on the Cross-Claim which is no more favourable
than the terms of this
offer, we put you on notice that MWN will rely upon this letter in support of
its application for indemnity
costs."</i>
<P>

72   	Neither offer was accepted.  Insofar as the First
Cross-Claim was dismissed, KJC's position would have been, obviously, more
favourable had the offer been accepted.  In these circumstances, MWN seeks
indemnity costs from the date of expiry of the first offer.
<P>

73   	The principles and authorities relating to the imposition
of indemnity costs failing an offeree's acceptance of an offer of
compromise
have already been referred to.  In addition, reference may be made to the
judgment of Einstein J in <b><i>Woodward v Sydney City Council &amp;
Anor</i></b><i> </i>(55060/97, unreported, 21 December 1998).  His Honour made
reference to the decision of Rolfe J in <b><i>Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v
Federal Airports Corporation</i></b> (1996) 138 ALR 425, setting out a passage
from the judgment in that case.  He also referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to the
judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <b><i>Black v
Tomislav Lipovac bhnf Maria Lipovac &amp; Ors</i></b> (unreported, 4 June 1998
(at p 46)) in which it was said:
<P>

<i>"In reality there is not a substantial difference between the two views;
both accept that the reasonableness of the conduct of the
offeree, viewed in
the light of the circumstances which existed when the offer was rejected, is
relevant to the exercise of the discretion
to award indemnifying costs.  To the
extent there is a difference we would prefer the by now well established line
of authority in
decisions of single judges of this court.  However we would
not, with respect, necessarily endorse the view of Sheppard J in <b>Sanki</b>
that the conduct of the offeree has to be `plainly unreasonable'.  To adopt an
especially high standard of unreasonableness would
operate as a fetter in the
discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the
<b>Calderbank</b> offer as an incentive to settlement.  There is in our view
force in the comments of Byrne J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in <b>Mutual
Community Ltd v Lorden Holdings Pty Ltd</b> (Unreported, Supreme Court of
Victoria, 28 April 1993) at 12-13 that `the policy of the Court is to encourage
litigating parties
to undertake genuine settlement negotiations and for that
purpose, to face up to serious offers of settlement'."</i>
<P>

74   	I am guided by the principles expressed in those passages.
It is clear that what I have to consider is the reasonableness
or otherwise of
the conduct of the offeree having regard to the circumstances obtaining at the
time when the offer was made and rejected.
 In this case, it is submitted on
behalf of KJC that both the nature of the offers and the circumstances in which
the offers had
to be considered produced the result that it was not
unreasonable for either of the offers to have been rejected.
<P>

75   	The first offer was received in circumstances where KJC
had received a claim for damages on behalf of HBL, which was detailed
and
extensive.  Additionally, there was evidence in the case which comprised
twenty-six volumes of witness statements and expert
reports in various fields
of expertise.  It may be accepted that KJC was faced with a significantly
difficult task in evaluation
of its position.  It is also clear that it was in
difficult financial circumstances and had only limited insurance cover.  The
offer,
itself, was far from straight forward.  As can be seen, it was
significantly conditional.  It could cease to have effect in the event
of MWN
being retained in the litigation or joined by the other parties after settling
with KJC.  Moreover, it was to be consummated
by a deed of release drafted by
MWN's legal advisers.  It is clear that this document would have required very
careful consideration
by KJC and that, apparently, it was to contain the final
agreement between the parties.  Although I have had some hesitation in the
matter, I have come to the conclusion that it was not unreasonable for KJC to
refuse to accept the offer on either occasion that
it was made, if, indeed, it
could be construed as an offer capable of acceptance.
<P>

76   	I therefore decline to make the indemnity costs order
sought.  I shall make, however, an order for costs on a party/party
basis which
will, of course, be caught up in the Sanderson type order to which I have
already made reference.  I consider, also,
that KJC is entitled to the costs of
the present hearing against MWN, as the only issue between them was the effect
of the Calderbank
offer.
<P>

77   	I also consider that, having regard to the period of time
over which the proceedings were in existence, it is appropriate
that I make an
order for the payment of interest on MWN's costs.  This interest accretion will
also be caught up under the Sanderson
order.
<P>

78   	I have been much assisted by counsel, who, at my request,
have furnished me with suggested forms of order to be made on the
basis of
findings that I might make in this case.  In conformity with the reasons that I
have given and the findings that I have
made and, having regard to counsel's
suggestions, I make the following orders:-
<P>

1.	That the First Defendant pay the costs of the Plaintiff in respect of the
Further Amended Summons and the Second Cross-Claim
(except those costs which
are subject to previous costs orders made against the plaintiff in favour of
the First Defendant) as either
agreed or assessed up to and including 12 August
1996 on a party/party basis and thereafter on an indemnity basis.
<P>

2.	That the First Defendant pay to the Plaintiff interest on the costs so
agreed or assessed at the rates applicable under Schedule
J to the Rules from
the dates on which such amounts were paid by the Plaintiff to its solicitors
until the date of the Assessor's
Certificate, the quantum of such interest to
be determined by the Assessor.
<P>

3.	That the First Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of the hearing on the
issue of costs on a party/party basis.
<P>

4.	That the First Defendant pay the costs of the Second Defendant in respect of
the Further Amended Summons and the Third Cross-Claim
on a party/party
basis.
<P>

5.	That the First Defendant Pay interest to the Second Defendant on the costs
so agreed or assessed at the rates applicable under
Schedule J to the rules
from the dates on which such amounts were paid by the Second Defendant to its
solicitors until the date of
the Assessor's Certificate, the quantum of such
interest to be determined by the Assessor.
<P>

6.	That the First Defendant pay the Second Defendant's costs of the hearing on
the issue of costs on a party/party basis.
<P>

7.	That the First Defendant pay the costs of the First Cross-Defendant in
respect of the First Cross-Claim on a party/party basis.
<P>

8.	That the First Defendant pay interest on the costs so agreed or assessed to
the First Cross-Defendant at the rates applicable
under Schedule J to the Rules
from the dates on which such amounts were paid by the First Cross-Defendant to
its solicitors until
the date of the Assessor's Certificate, the quantum of
such interest to be determined by the Assessor.
<P>

9.	That the Second Defendant pay the First Cross-Defendant's costs of the
hearing on the issue of costs on a party/party basis.
<P>
