<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	By a Summons issued on 3 December 1998 the plaintiff, for which Mr I.M. Wales
of Senior Counsel appeared, sought orders that judgment
be entered against all
the defendants, for which and whom, save for the third defendant, Mr J.T.
Johnson of Counsel appeared, in
the sum of $150,000 together with interest from
16 October 1998 to the date of judgment at the rate specified by the Supreme
Court
Rules, and that judgment be entered against all the defendants, save the
third defendant, in the sum of $750,000 together with interest
from the same
date and at the same rate.  The Summons alleged and, at least ultimately, so
much was not in issue, that on 22 September
1998 the plaintiff and the
defendants entered into a Deed of Settlement and Release, which is referred to
in the pleadings as "the
Contract", pursuant to clause 3.1.1 of which the first
defendant, at the request of the other defendants, acknowledged that it was
indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $150,000 for "the TPG Commissions", and
pursuant to clause 3.1.2 of which the second defendant,
at the request of the
other defendants, save for the third defendant, agreed to pay to the plaintiff
$750,000 in consideration for
which the plaintiff agreed to transfer to the
second defendant all its right title and interest in shares held by the
plaintiff in
the third defendant, which was referred to as "the Equity Sum".
<P>

2	It was pleaded that pursuant to clause 3.2.1 of the Contract, the first
defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff the TPG Commissions
by three equal
monthly instalments of $50,000, the first being payable on 15 October 1998; and
that pursuant to clauses 3.3.1. and
3.3.2, the second defendant agreed to pay
to the plaintiff the Equity Sum either in full on 15 October 1998, or by seven
monthly
instalments of $100,000 and one instalment of $50,000, the first
instalment of $100,000 being payable on 15 October 1998.
<P>

3	It was further pleaded that pursuant to clause 3.5.1 if either the first or
second defendant failed to pay the moneys due pursuant
to clauses 3.2.1 or
3.3.2 on or before 15 October 1998 the plaintiff was entitled to issue a
Default Notice requiring payment within
twenty one days of that Notice and
making time of the essence, and that pursuant to clause 3.5.2 if the first
and/or second defendants
failed to comply with that Notice all moneys due by
them pursuant to the Contract "would become immediately due and payable with
interest ...".
<P>

4	In paragraph 10 it was pleaded that neither defendant paid the moneys due on
15 October 1998 and, in paragraph 11, that on 16
October 1998 the plaintiff
served upon the first and second defendants a Default Notice requiring payment
of the initial instalments
on or before 7 November 1998 and making time of the
essence.  In paragraph 12 it was pleaded that the moneys demanded and payable
on 7 November 1998 were not paid "and consequently all monies due and payable
by the first and second defendants pursuant to the
Contract have fallen due for
payment".
<P>

5	All the matters to which I have referred were admitted in paragraph 3 of the
Notice of Grounds of Defence filed on 18 February
1998 "subject to paragraph 2
above".  Paragraph 2 of that document, whilst admitting that the defendants
executed the Contract, did
not admit that the plaintiff validly executed it "on
that date or at any date thereafter prior to the date of the commencement of
these proceedings".  That basis of defence was expressly abandoned by Mr
Johnson on 5 March 1999.
<P>

6	The Summons continued that pursuant to clause 3.9 of the Contract the second
to seventh defendants, and the first and fourth to
seventh defendants
respectively guaranteed the obligations of the first and second defendants
under the Contract.  In paragraph 13,
where secondly appearing, it was asserted
that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment against all defendants
"forthwith".
<P>

7	The Notice of Grounds of Defence pleaded:-
<P>

	<b>"In answer to paragraph 13, subject to paragraph 2 above and the fact that
the defendants say that the plaintiff has not made any
demand upon the
defendants in their capacity as guarantors as required by clause 3.9.3(b), the
respective defendants admit the matters
set forth therein."</b>
<P>

8	This raised one issue, namely whether there was a contractual obligation on
the plaintiff, before it could recover against the
defendants in their capacity
as guarantors, to make a demand on the defendants, which it had not done.
<P>

9	On 24 February 1999 the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion seeking summary
judgment against all, save the third, defendants, pursuant
to Part 13 rule 2.
That Notice of Motion was supported by the affidavits of Mr Warwick David
Abadee and Mr Timothy Fulton Edwards,
both sworn on 23 February 1999.  Both
affidavits were read and relied upon.
<P>

10	The Notice of Motion came before me on 5 March 1999.  Mr Johnson, in
addition to abandoning the defence raised in paragraph 2
of the Notice of
Grounds of Defence, agreed that the only matter in issue was whether, on a
proper construction of the Contract,
the plaintiff was entitled to succeed in
circumstances where it had not given a notice.  This defence, it was conceded,
only availed
the defendants in their capacity as guarantors and Mr Johnson
conceded that the first and second defendants had no defence in respect
of
their obligations under clause 3.5.2 of the Contract.  In these circumstances
he consented to judgment for the plaintiff against
the first defendant for
$155,465.60, and against the second defendant for $777,239.40, each of such
amounts including an interest
component to 5 March 1999.  He also consented to
an order that those defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings to
date,
and it was noted that the judgment sums were in respect only of the first
and second defendants' obligations under paragraph 3.5.2
"and not in respect of
their obligations as guarantors or persons bound to indemnify the plaintiff
under the said Deed".
<P>

11	Although Mr Wales submitted that it was not necessary to give notice either
at all or pursuant to clause 3.9.3(b) he decided,
for an abundance of caution,
to do so and in those circumstances, and without opposition from Mr Johnson, I
granted the plaintiff
leave to file and serve an Amended Summons by 12 noon on
Thursday, 11 March 1999 and I stood the Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment
over until Friday, 19 March 1999.  I gave certain further directions and made
the orders to which I have referred.
<P>

<b>The Present Proceedings</b>
<P>

12	On 9 March 1999 the plaintiff filed an Amended Summons containing the same
allegations as those set forth in paragraphs 1 to
11 of the original Summons.

<P>

13	The amendments were made in paragraphs 12 to 18 inclusive, it being alleged
in paragraph 12 that further or in the alternative
the plaintiff served further
Default Notices on or about 3 December 1998; that the moneys demanded and
payable on 7 November and
24 December 1998 pursuant to the several default
notices were not paid "and consequently all moneys due and payable by the first
and second defendants pursuant to the Contract have fallen due for payment";
that pursuant to clause 3.9 various defendants guaranteed
the obligations of
the first and second defendants and indemnified the plaintiff in respect of any
failure by them to perform their
respective obligations; that by notice given
to the defendants on or about 8 March 1999 the plaintiff required them to
comply with
their obligations under the Contract, which they failed to do; and
that on 3 December 1998 the plaintiff filed a Summons in the Equity
Division
and subsequently served it upon the defendants, which Summons constituted a
demand with which demand the defendants failed
to comply.
<P>

14	The Notice of Grounds of Defence to the Amended Summons again raised whether
the plaintiff validly executed the Contract, an
allegation which was expressly
abandoned when the matter was heard on 19 March 1999.  Subject to that matter
paragraph 3 was admitted
and, the effect of the Defence was to admit paragraphs
1 to 14 inclusive.
<P>

15	In paragraph 4 it was pleaded:-
<P>

<b>"4.	In answer to paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the Amended Summons the
defendants, subject to paragraph 2 above, say:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	that the plaintiff did not make any demand upon them in their capacities
as guarantors and/or indemnifiers as required by clause
3.9.3(b) or at all
prior to the commencement of these proceedings;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	that they admit the matters set forth therein; and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	that any demand made by virtue of the filing and serving of the Summons
or after the commencement of the proceedings is of no
validity to ground any
action against them."</b>
<P>

16	There was then a denial of the amount claimed and, in paragraph 6, which was
added subsequently, it was pleaded:-
<P>

	<b>"In the alternative to paragraph 5 above if it is that the defendants are
liable in these proceedings for any amount (which is denied)
that amount is
limited to those instalments due under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 as to the
liability of the first defendant as primary
obligor under the Deed and clause
3.3.2 as to the liability of the second defendant as primary obligor under the
Deed at the date
of commencement of the proceedings and not to any accelerated
obligation of the first defendant or the second defendant arising under
any
other clause of the Deed."</b>
<P>

17	The matter proceeded, as I have indicated, by way of a Motion for Summary
Judgment.  Whilst it was inherent in the way in which
the motion was treated on
5 March 1999 that no point was being taken that this was an inappropriate
vehicle in which to determine
the dispute, no submission having been put to me
that the <b>General Steels </b>test had not been met, Mr Johnson expressly
agreed on 19 March 1999 that no such point was being taken, that there was no
evidentiary
matter on which the defendants for which and whom he appeared
wished to rely, and that I should treat the hearing as being a hearing
of the
points raised in the Notice of Grounds of Defence to the Amended Summons on a
final basis.  Accordingly, in the way in which
the case was conducted before
me, which, if I may say so with respect, was eminently sensible having regard
to the short issues raised,
no discretionary question as to whether this was an
appropriate case in which to exercise the summary judgment jurisdiction was
raised
and, to the contrary, Mr Johnson invited me to determine the matter as
on a final hearing.
<P>

<b>The Terms Of The Contract</b>
<P>

18	The contract was stated to be Deed of Settlement and Release between various
parties including the plaintiffs and the defendants.
 In clause 2 it recited
various litigation between the parties, the following sentence appearing at the
conclusion of that clause:-
<P>

	<b>"Without admission, the Parties wish to settle their disputes upon the
terms and conditions contained in this deed."</b>
<P>

The words "party" and "parties" defined each party and all parties to the
Contract.  Clause 3.1 contained an acknowledgment by the
first defendant of its
indebtedness to the plaintiff for the TPG Commissions in the sum of $150,000.
Clause 3.2.1 stated that the
first defendant "shall pay" the plaintiff that
amount "in full and final satisfaction of TPG Commissions" by instalments of
$50,000
on or before 15 October, November and December 1998.
<P>

19	Clause 3.3.1 provided that the second defendant "shall pay" to the plaintiff
"the Equity Sum" of $750,000 on or before 15 October
1998.  Clause 3.3.2
provided that if the second defendant did not do so it was to pay the plaintiff
by instalments of $100,000 each
on 15 October, November and December 1998, and
15 January, February, March and April 1999, with a final instalment of $50,000
on
15 May 1999.
<P>

20	Clause 3.5.1 provided that should any of the amounts referred to in clauses
3.2.1 and 3.3.2 not be paid on the dates specified
therein, the plaintiff
should be entitled to serve upon the defaulting party or parties notices
requiring payment of the sum due
within twenty one days of the date of the
notice and making time of the essence of that payment.  Such a notice is
described in the
Contract as "a Default Notice".
<P>

21	Clause 3.5.2 provided that if the sum demanded in a Default Notice was not
paid on or before the date stated in such Notice all
outstanding moneys due and
owing to the plaintiff pursuant to clauses 3.2.1 and 3.3.2 inclusive "shall
become immediately due and
payable without further notice or demand"; and that
the plaintiff should be entitled to interest on all of the moneys referred to
in sub-clause (a) "at the rate specified from time to time in Schedule J of the
Supreme Court Rules from the date stated in a Default
Notice until the date of
payment".
<P>

22	Clause 3.9.1 provided that the second to seventh defendants inclusive:-
<P>

	<b>".. hereby individually and together guarantee in favour of Kintsu the due
and punctual performance by TPG of its obligations to pay
the TPG Commissions
in the sum and on the date specified in clause 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of this deed and
agree to indemnify Kintsu in
respect of any failure by TPG to duly perform its
obligations under clause 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of this deed."</b>
<P>

23	Clause 3.9.2 provided that the first and third to seventh defendants:-
<P>

	<b>".. individually and together hereby guarantee in favour of Kintsu the due
and punctual performance by PGA of its obligations under
clause 3.3.2 of this
deed and agree to indemnify Kintsu in respect to any failure by PGA to duly
perform its obligations under clause
3.3.2 of this deed."</b>
<P>

24	Paragraph 3.9.3 provided the bases on which guarantees and indemnities were
given, sub-clause (b) thereof stating that in the
event of any failure by a
Party, whose performance had been guaranteed, duly and punctually to perform
its obligations, the guaranteeing
Party will forthwith on demand perform or
procure performance of the required obligations.
<P>

25	It was not suggested that either sub-clauses (a) or (c) were relevant, but
sub-clause (d) was relied upon, it providing:-
<P>

<b>"(d)	in the event of any Party is unable to obtain performance by
guaranteeing Party on the surety on the footing of a guarantee (for
any such
reason whatever) then such performance shall nevertheless be obtainable from
such guaranteeing Party as a principal obligation
of that guaranteeing Party
and each guaranteeing Party as a separate and additional obligation shall
indemnify Kintsu in respect
thereof."</b>
<P>

<b>The Course Of The Proceedings on 5 March 1999</b>
<P>

26	The sole argument advanced by the defendants, for whom and which Mr Johnson
appeared on 5 March 1999, was that clause 3.9 had
not been activated because no
demand had been made on the parties such as to make them liable under the
guarantee provisions and,
accordingly, it could not be said that the plaintiff
was unable to obtain performance by a guaranteeing party of its guarantee such
as to give rise to the right to pursue the guaranteeing parties by way of
claiming the existence of a principal obligation because
of the word "then" in
sub-clause (d).
<P>

27	Mr Wales submitted that this was not a disqualifying factor and that, when
one had regard to the terms of the Contract as a whole,
it was not necessary to
give such notice and, further, that it was not necessary to give notice to
activate the principal indemnity
provision.
<P>

28	After some discussion, however, Mr Wales decided, for an abundance of
caution, to accept judgment against the first and second
defendants in the
terms to which I have referred, and to have the proceedings stood over so that
a Notice of Demand could be served
and, thereafter, the Summons amended.  This
was done and I have noted the amendments to the Summons.
<P>

	<b>The Proceedings On 19 March 1999</b>
<P>

29	The Notice of Grounds of Defence to the Amended Summons, upon which reliance
was placed initially, was that as the demand had
not been made prior to the
commencement of the proceedings, it was not a demand upon which the plaintiff
could rely in these proceedings.
 Mr Johnson's submission was that if fresh
proceedings were instituted this submission would not avail the defendants in
their roles
as guarantors and indemnifiers.
<P>

30	In my opinion there was no substance in that submission.  Part 20 rule 1(3A)
provides:-
<P>

<b>"An order may be made, or leave may be granted, under sub-rule (1)
notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment is, or would be,
to add or
substitute a cause of action arising after commencement of the proceedings, but
in such a case the date of commencement
of the proceedings, so far as concerns
that cause of action, shall, subject to sub-rule (4) be the date on which the
amendment is
made."</b>
<P>

31	It was not submitted that sub-rule (4) has any application.  Accordingly the
date of the commencement of the proceedings, so
far as concerns the additional
cause of action, is the date on which the amendment was made, namely 9 March
1990.
<P>

32	In the face of the clear words of the sub-rule Mr Johnson's submission was
that it only applied if there was a subsisting cause
of action to which the
further cause of action may be added or for which it may be substituted.  He
submitted that in the present
case the original Summons contained no cause of
action and, accordingly, sub-rule (3A) had no application.
<P>

33	I do not agree with this submission for several reasons.  Firstly, the power
to amend is a power to amend "any document in the
proceedings".  It may well be
that a pleading is held not to disclose a cause of action and, for that reason,
the Court may decide
to exercise its power to strike out the pleading.  It
frequently happens, in those circumstances, that the Court grants leave to
amend the document to plead a cause of action.  In my opinion the words of the
rules, particularly having regard to the requirement
of sub-rule (2) that all
necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real
questions raised by or otherwise
depending on the proceedings, or of correcting
any defect or error in any proceedings, or of avoiding multiplicity of
proceedings,
are totally at odds with the submission made by Mr Johnson.
<P>

34	Secondly, even if I be wrong in the view I have taken of a provision
intended to ensure that the real matters in issue are litigated
and that there
is an avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings, it is not correct to say that
the Summons did not disclose a cause
of action.  It disclosed a cause of
action, as was conceded by Mr Johnson, against the first and second defendants
in relation to
their primary obligations.  Therefore, even if contrary to the
view to which I have come, it is necessary to have a viable cause
of action in
the original Summons, to which another cause of action could be added or for
which a cause of action could be substituted,
such an original cause of action
existed.
<P>

35	Understanding the force of this position Mr Johnson submitted, in reply,
that the amount payable by the defendants was limited
to the instalments under
clauses 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 as to the liability of the first defendant as primary
obligor under the Contract,
and clause 3.3.2 as to the liability of the second
defendant as primary obligor under the Contract at the date of the commencement
of the proceedings, and not to any accelerated obligation arising under any
other clause of the contract.  I required this to be
pleaded and, accordingly,
Mr Johnson brought in a Further Amended Notice of Grounds of Defence
incorporating paragraph 6.  
<P>

36	Mr Johnson conceded that this defence did not avail the defendants in
relation to the liability of the first defendant, as the
obligation to make all
three payments pursuant to clause 3.2.1, even on his submission, had come to
fruition by 15 December 1998.
 The only submission made was that the Summons
was issued on 3 December 1998, prior to the instalment of 15 December 1998
falling
due, and, accordingly, it was not recoverable.  However that
submission, in my opinion, overlooked the clear words of sub-rule (3A).
<P>

37	A similar submission was made in respect of the payments to be made pursuant
to clause 3.3.2, it being noted that there were
six payments to be made after 3
December 1998, and three payments to be made after the Amended Summons was
filed on 9 March 1999.
<P>

38	Mr Johnson's submission was that on a proper construction of clauses 3.9.1
and 3.9.2 the only obligations undertaken by the guarantors
and indemnifiers
were to pay the instalments as they fell due in accordance with the timetable
set forth in clauses 3.2.1 and 3.3.2.
 This submission may have some force in
relation to the guarantee provision, although in my opinion, on a proper
reading of the whole
of the Contract, once the totality of the moneys became
payable it ceased to have the effect for which Mr Johnson contended.  However,
in my opinion, Mr Johnson's submission could not overcome the words of the
agreement to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of any
failure by the first and
second defendants "to duly perform its obligations" under clauses 3.1.1, in so
far as it imposed any obligation,
3.2.1 and 3.3.2.
<P>

39	The question then is what that obligation was.  The answer to that is
provided by clauses 3.5.1 and 3.5.2, it not being in issue
that Default Notices
were served, thereby making all outstanding moneys due and owing to the
plaintiff pursuant to the payment clauses
"immediately due and payable without
further notice or demand".  Thus, in my opinion, the indemnity provisions allow
for the recovery
of the moneys from the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
defendants.  There has already been judgment entered against the first and
second defendants and the plaintiff, as I understood it, did not press for
judgment against the third defendant.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

40	I order that:-
<P>

(1)	Pursuant to Part 20 rule 1(3A) the date of commencement of the proceedings,
so far as concerns any cause of action asserted
in the Amended Summons not in
existence on 3 December 1998, be 9 March 1999.
<P>

(2)	Judgment for the plaintiff against the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
defendants in the sum of $156,132.50, which sum is inclusive
of interest.
<P>

(3)	Judgment for the plaintiff against the fourth, fifth sixth and seventh
defendants in the sum of $780,663.50, which sum is inclusive
of interest.
<P>

(4)	The defendants, other than the third defendant, pay the plaintiff's costs
of the proceedings.
