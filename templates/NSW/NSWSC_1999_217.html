<b>4167/98  -  RE GRAF HOLDINGS PTY LTD &amp; THE CORPORATIONS LAW;  BRIAN

<P>

<b>4168/98  -  RE PARER HOLDINGS PTY LTD &amp; THE CORPORATIONS LAW;  BRIAN
RICHARD LARKING  V  AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES &amp; INVESTMENTS
COMMISSION &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 15 March 1999 and revised on 18 March
1999)</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff is the liquidator of Graf Holdings Pty Ltd (`Graf Holdings')
and its subsidiary Parer Holdings Pty Ltd (`Parer'),
which are both in
voluntary winding up.  In two parallel proceedings he seeks directions under s
511(1) of the Corporations Law with
respect to the Second Bluebird Unit Trust
(`the Trust').  The Trust may have existed and, if it did, Graf Holdings and
Parer may
have owed money to the Trust.  The directions sought in the
proceedings are to the effect that Mr Larking as liquidator of the two
companies would be justified in making distributions of their assets on the
basis that, in each case, the company is not indebted
to the Trust or any
person as trustee or beneficiary of the Trust.
<P>

2	The two companies were part of a group controlled by the late William Graf.
In <i>Bluebird Investments Pty Ltd v Graf</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13 ACSR 271</a>, Santow J
described the group as follows (at 274-5):
<P>

	`Mr Graf was a man of limited formal education who built up substantial wealth
based on property development.  He died on 26 June
1988 in his 80s and had left
the wealth he had accumulated in a complex corporate group.  In the later years
of his life he was not
a particularly well man.  He had a cancer operation in
1973 which left him with a swollen torso, and a stroke in early 1983.  He
remained mentally alert.  He became increasingly critical about costs of the
overseas portion of the structure of the group.  The
wealth he had accumulated
was reputedly worth between $30m and $40m and was tied up mostly in real
property in the West Ryde area.
 
<P>

	This group consisted of over 20 companies that owned different pieces of real
estate and assets.  Some companies, as shall be discussed
below, were set up
for tax purposes.  Mr Graf himself, from the evidence before me, had little
detailed understanding of corporate
structure and relied heavily on advice from
his advisers.  However he controlled each company through one or more of a
number of
mechanisms.  These included:  by being a shareholder, director,
governing director, or having a power of attorney (as he did from
Bluebird
Canada) or being the sole person on the board of management (as he was in
relation to the Stichting) or being the person
the board of directors answered
to in practice.  In this way, while not owning his wealth, or all of it, he did
not control it. ...
<P>

	As the evidence showed, there were frequent changes of intent on Mr Graf's
part as to what specifically was to be done and an increasing
reluctance to
spend money on legal costs.  His general objective, manifested in various ways,
was for the corporate assets of the
Graf group to be maintained intact for at
least 50 years after his death and controlled in his lifetime by himself.
However an equally
consistent theme was the avoidance of taxation, whether
income tax or, earlier till its abolition, death duties.  Attention to the
details of implementation in Australia was at times less than meticulous.  Mr
Graf's lack of changes of mind would not have helped,
particularly when added
to a reluctance to pay costs.'
<P>

3	There is no direct evidence of the creation and operation of the Trust and no
trust deed, unitholders register or books of account
have been found by the
liquidator.  However, there is some evidence which suggests that the Trust
existed in about the period 1979
to 1981 and possibly for longer, and that the
beneficiaries included, at least at one stage, Graf Holdings and a company
called Mary
Victoria Pty Ltd (`Mary Victoria').  There is also evidence that
Graf Holdings and Parer were at one time indebted to the Trust in
a total
amount of $1,130,353.  But the group's records are unclear and incomplete,
possibly because of the factors identified by
Santow J.  I shall first review
the evidence.
<P>

	<b>The existence of the trust and the identity of the beneficiaries</b>
<P>

4	The evidence on these matters includes the following:
<P>

	1.	Minutes of a meeting held on 29 April 1980 of the directors of Mary
Victoria record a resolution approving an application by
that company to
another company called Jagolmbe Pty Ltd as trustee of the Trust, for ten
additional units in the Trust, and authorising
a cheque in favour of Jagolmbe
for $4,290.00.
<P>

	2.	Minutes of a meeting of directors of Graf Holdings held on 12 March 1981
record a resolution approving an application by that
company to Jagolmbe as
trustee of the Trust for ten additional units, and authorising a cheque in
favour of Jagolmbe for $7,698.81.
<P>

	3.	Folios in the general journal and in the general ledger of Graf Holdings
record an acquisition of units in the Trust on 12 March
1981 for $7,698.71,
plus an assignment of options.
<P>

	4.	A folio headed `Second Bluebird Unit Trust' in the general ledger of Graf
Holdings contains an entry dated 7 March 1979 referring
to `1,010 units', and
an entry on 29 April 1980 debiting `Cash Jagolmbe units' in the amount of
$4,290.00 and crediting the `Cash
Trust 1' in the same amount.
<P>

	5.	A note to the financial statements which are part of the annual reports of
Graf Holdings for each of the years 30 June 1990
to 30 June 1996 records a
non-current investment of $7,709.00 in 1989 and 1990 for the `Second Bluebird
Unit Trust at cost'.
<P>

	6.	A page headed `W E J Graf, Summary of Trusts' refers to Jagolmbe as trustee
and says `acquired ten options to Units in Trust
for $4,290 which were issued
to Mary Victoria Pty Ltd and it paid $4,290 for assignment of the Units'.
<P>

	7.	The same page says `Unitholders equity - on sight Bills of Exchange ex 1978
$347,979.00 ex 1979 $438,320.00'.
<P>

	8.	The second page of what appears to be the same document records the Trust
as beneficiary of ten redeemable preference shares
in Bluebird Investments Pty
Ltd, another group company of which the plaintiff is the liquidator.
<P>

5	The plaintiff has seen no other document referring to or suggesting that any
person other than Graf Holdings and Mary Victoria
may hold or may have held
units in the Trust.
<P>

	<b>The evidence of indebtedness of Graf Holdings to the Trust</b>
<P>

6	The evidence includes the following:
<P>

	1.	A folio in the general ledger of Graf Holdings headed `Second Bluebird Unit
Trust' refers to a credit balance of $440,708.71.
<P>

	2.	A note to the financial statements in the annual report of Graf Holdings
for the year ended 30 June 1990 records for 1989 but
not 1990 an `unsecured
loan' of $440,708.00 from the Trust, described as `a non-current liability',
but in subsequent years to 30
June 1996 that amount is shown as a liability in
both the financial year of the report and the previous year.
<P>

	3.	The statement by the directors of Graf Holdings in the annual report for
the year ended 30 June 1990 records (inter alia) the
liability to the Trust and
says the directors are continuing their enquiries into the circumstances under
which the liability was
incurred, and there is a similar statement in a
qualification in the auditor's report by the plaintiff for that year and
subsequent
years to 30 June 1996.
<P>

However, the plaintiff has seen nothing in the records of Graf Holdings
referring to any communication of the contents of those
annual reports to any
officer of Jagolmbe.
<P>

	<b>The evidence of the indebtedness of Parer to the Trust</b>
<P>

7	There is rather more evidence concerning the liability of Parer to the Trust
on two bills of exchange drawn in favour of the Trust
and accepted by Parer.
One was drawn by Kemlat Pty Ltd for $347,979 and was accepted on 29 April 1980,
and the other was drawn by
Justbon Pty Ltd for $341,665 and was accepted on 20
March 1981, the two together totalling $689,644.
<P>

8	The evidence for the Kemlat bill transaction comprises journal and ledger
entries for Parer (themselves ambiguous), an application
by Kemlat for
acceptance of the bill, minutes of a meeting of Parer's directors agreeing to
accept the bill, and the bill itself.
 There is also evidence that sixteen
other companies, apparently all in the Graf group, drew bills on 29 April 1980
in favour of
Kemlat, which were also accepted by Parer.  These bills, for a
total amount of $347,979, contain a direction by Kemlat to pay Parer
on its
behalf.  The exact purpose of these bill transactions is not disclosed by the
evidence but they seem to have had the commercial
effect of consolidating a
series of intra-group debts in Kemlat and then Parer, and creating an
entitlement for the Trust to be paid
the consolidated amount by Parer.
<P>

9	The Justbon bill transaction, which occurred on 20 March 1981, seems to be
similar.  The bill for $341,665 was drawn by Justbon,
accepted by Parer,
payable to Jagolmbe.  Sixteen companies, evidently companies in the Graf group,
drew bills totalling $341,665,
accepted by Parer and payable to Justbon.  This
time each of the sixteen bills was endorsed `discharged by set-off on 21 March
1981'
and that endorsement was signed by Justbon and Parer.  There is also a
minute of a meeting of the Parer directors on 20 March 1981
which records that
Justbon was indebted to Parer in the sum of $341,665, and that this debt would
be set off against Parer's obligation
as acceptor of a bill of which Justbon
was the holder.  It is not clear whether this set-off discharged Parer's
liability as acceptor
of the bill drawn by Justbon in favour of the Trust, but
the financial statements in the annual reports of Parer from 30 June 1990
to 30
June 1995 show an entry for `current creditors and borrowings' of `bills
payable' in the sum of $689,644.
<P>

	<b>Mr Frazer's theory</b>
<P>

10	The plaintiff obtained a report dated 15 May 1996 from Mr Andrew Frazer of
Frazer Hall, chartered accountants, which reviewed
the evidence as to the
alleged liability of Graf Holdings and Parer.  Mr Frazer concluded that the
Trust existed and that its activities
were related to tax minimisation.  He
noted a consistency of timing of major transactions just prior to the former
Division 7 deadline
in three consecutive years (presumably the years ended 30
June 1979, 1980 and 1981).  He found evidence that various group companies
paid
dividends and he said:
<P>

	`The general thrust of the tax minimisation strategy used by the group in
those three years was the acquisition by the Second Bluebird
Unit Trust of
options over dividend producing shares in companies within the group, the
declaration of dividends on those shares,
the revaluation of those options in
recognition of the declared dividends, the subscription of inflated
considerations for additional
units and a redemption of the recently issued
units. ...
<P>

	Graf's intentions for his group's ownership endured several phases including
the 1961 to 1965 trusts, the removal of the dividend
stream to the Netherlands
Antilles until the early 1970's, the purchase from Philips Industries of Parer
as an excess distribution
company in the mid 1970's, participation in charity
schemes involving the Moriah War Memorial Association and successively the
Bluebird
First &amp; Second Unit Trusts.  Following amended tax assessments
totalling approximately $1 million, the 1980's saw the group paying
income tax
without the use of tax minimisation schemes. 
<P>

	Graf's final vision for his group was reflected in his last Will which assumed
his total ownership of the group and the maintenance
of ownership through a
succession of life tenancies. ...
<P>

	It is possible therefore, and perhaps likely, that Graf instructed Biddlecombe
to close the Second Bluebird Unit Trust activities
by completing the circle,
resulting in the Parer debentures and the Holdings loan being owed to Holdings.
...
<P>

	In many of the tax minimisation mechanisms employed by the Graf group, aspects
have endured despite having been ignored for many
years.  This is true of the
twenty four 1960's trusts determining ownership of the group and the continuing
liabilities of members
of the group to the Moriah War memorial Association.
<P>

	Although it has been accepted since Graf's death that he did not have sole
ownership of the Group beyond the mid-1960's, Graf nevertheless
believed he did
have such ownership.  The return to Holdings of the group's dividend stream
declared in 1979, 1980 and 1981, by achieving
sole unit holding status for
Holdings, would have been consistent with Graf's belief of his sole ownership
of the group.
<P>

	Graf's dislike for incurring ongoing costs in maintaining minimisation schemes
is documented in the `Bluebird' case.  The development
of the conclusion to
that major off-shore scheme, occurred contemporaneously with the finalisation
of the Second Bluebird Unit Trust.
 The efficacy of the off-shore matter was
confirmed by the Supreme Court of NSW.  In the absence of conflicting evidence
I consider
it reasonable to conclude that Biddlecombe [Graf's accountant]
issued, to Holdings, units in the Second Bluebird Unit Trust which
resulted in
Holdings being the sole unitholder in that trust.'
<P>

11	Mr Frazer provided affidavit evidence in the present proceedings in which he
clarified his report but he did not, as far as I
can see, resile from his
overall theory.  His clarification related to remarks in his report which
implied that Kemlat had been a
unitholder in the Trust.  He noted that an entry
in a folio of the general ledger of Graf Holdings headed `Second Bluebird Unit
Trust'
shows a credit entry on 2 March 1979 of $434,020.00 entitled `Cash
Kemlat 1,010 units'.  He said that apart from this folio he had
never seen any
document referring to Kemlat or Justbon recording the acquisition of units in
the Trust, nor had anyone suggested
this had occurred.  A balance sheet of
Justbon shows an interest in unit trusts as at 30 June 1981 but that investment
is shown as
zero in the balance sheet as at 30 June 1982.  The balance sheet of
Kemlat as at 30 June 1985 does not show any units in any unit
trust as an
asset.  
<P>

	<b>Conclusions as to existence of Trust, identity of beneficiaries, and debts
of Graf Holdings and Parer to the Trust</b>
<P>

12	Weighing up the flimsy evidence as best I can, I have reached the following
conclusions:
<P>

	1.	The Trust existed, at least during the approximate period from 1979 to
1981, and possibly earlier and later.
<P>

	2.	Jagolmbe was the trustee, at least during the period 1979 to 1981.
<P>

	3.	In the absence of any evidence of its termination, the Trust may continue
to exist.
<P>

	4.	Mary Victoria and Graf Holdings acquired units by subscription in about
1980 and 1981 respectively, and appear to have taken
them beneficially.
<P>

13	None of this can be said with any certainty because the records are so
incomplete and cryptic.  Mary Victoria may well have ceased
to be a unitholder
subsequently, since that  company's financial statements for the year ended 30
June 1995 do not identify any units
as assets, and its records do not otherwise
indicate that it has continued to hold units.  The view that Mary Victoria has
ceased
to be a unitholder would be consistent with Mr Frazer's theory that
after the Trust had done its work of tax minimisation, all of
the issued units
were vested in Graf Holdings, and no-one bothered to wind up the Trust.
<P>

14	As to the position of Kemlat and Justbon, my opinion is that, whether they
held units at some earlier stage, they had ceased
to do so by the time they
were deregistered.  Their deregistrations occurred on 8 September 1989 and 22
December 1993 respectively.
<P>

15	As to Kemlat, the general ledger folio of Graf Holdings, to which I have
referred, admittedly shows an entry referring to `Kemlat
1,010 units'.
However, no documents have been found referring to that narrative, nor
otherwise referring to Kemlat acquiring or holding
units in the Trust.  Both
the plaintiff and Mr Frazer say in their affidavits that they have otherwise
not seen any documents referring
to Kemlat acquiring or disposing of any units
and, as I mentioned earlier, the only balance sheet in evidence for Kemlat does
not
show units in any unit trust as an asset.
<P>

16	As to Justbon, its balance sheets from 1982 onwards do not disclose any
assets in the nature of units in unit trusts.  The 1981
balance sheet
identified an asset entitled `Interest in Unit Trust' but the unit trust was
not identified.  Both the plaintiff and
Mr Frazer say in their affidavits that
they have not seen any documents referring to Justbon acquiring or disposing of
any units
in the Trust apart from the1981 balance sheet.
<P>

17	I conclude, therefore, that there is no evidence before me which establishes
that anyone, apart from Mary Victoria and Graf Holdings,
is still a unitholder
in the Trust, and it may be that Mary Victoria is no longer a unitholder.
<P>

18	As to the debts, it appears to me that Graf Holdings and Parer respectively
became indebted to the Trust in the sums of $440,709
and $689,644 respectively
in the circumstances outlined above.  There is some evidence to indicate that
the debts which they incurred
were part of a process which may well have been a
tax minimisation scheme of the kind outlined by Mr Frazer.
<P>

	<b>Legal entitlements implied by these findings</b>
<P>

19	In order to understand the legal consequences of these findings it is
necessary to have some idea of the structure of the group.
 As I have
indicated, Parer is a subsidiary of Graf Holdings.  The evidence indicates that
Graf Holdings is the beneficial owner
of all of the shares in Parer.  
<P>

20	Mary Victoria is was deregistered on 17 May 1997.  According to the
evidence, 1,000 of its 1,010 shares were held by Graf Holdings
No 4 Pty Ltd (In
Liquidation).  Its liquidator was John Stewart.  Maryanne Menzies was principal
executive officer from 29 August
1991 to 8 December 1993 and was a director
from 29 August 1991 to 17 May 1997.  Andrew Frazer was secretary from 16
October 1989
to 26 November 1990.  
<P>

21	There are eight shareholders of Graf Holdings No 4 Pty Ltd (In Liquidation),
namely, Graf Holdings, Graf Holdings (No 2) and
(No 3), Bluebird Investments
Pty Ltd (In Liquidation), Jagolmbe (which, as I have said, has been dissolved),
A Birrell, J E Hunt
and Clarence Cutler.  The shareholding structure is
complicated, there being various classes of shares held by the various
shareholders.
 The liquidator is John Stewart.  Maryanne Menzies was the
principal executive officer from 13 July 1991 to 8 December 1995 and has
been a
director since 13 July 1991.  Andrew Frazer was the secretary from 16 October
1989 to 26 November 1990.
<P>

22	Jagolmbe was a company associated with Mr Biddlecombe, who was Mr Graf's
accountant until he died in 1981.  After that time two
partners of Mr
Biddlecombe remained as directors until it was deregistered on 10 July 1992.
<P>

23	The debts which appear to have been owing to the Trust by Graf Holdings and
Parer were assets of the Trust held by Jagolmbe for
the benefit of the
beneficiaries of the Trust.  I have found that the only evidence is that there
may have been two beneficiaries,
namely, Graf Holdings and Mary  Victoria.  To
the extent that Graf Holdings is the beneficiary of the Trust, the distribution
of
the assets of the company in liquidation is unproblematic, since the trust
assets are debts owing by Graf Holdings and its wholly
owned subsidiary Parer.
To the extent that Mary Victoria may have had an interest in the Trust, and to
the extent there may have
been some other beneficiaries of whom there appears
to be now no evidence, a question arises as to the proper course to be taken
in
the liquidation of the two debtor companies and the distribution of their
surplus assets on winding up.  Had Jagolmbe remained
in existence it would have
had a duty as trustee to protect the interests of those beneficiaries.
However, Jagolmbe no longer exists
and the question is whether there are any
duties or entitlements vested in anyone else as a result of Jagolmbe's
deregistration.
<P>

24	When Jagolmbe was dissolved s 576 of the Corporations Law, as it then stood,
had the effect that the assets of that company,
including any properties held
by that company in trust, were vested in the Australian Securities Commission.
Although s 576 was not
entirely clear its effect was, in the case of assets
held in trust, to vest the legal title to the assets in the Commission as
trustee<i>: Optel Pty Ltd v National Companies and Securities Commission</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%202%20ACSR%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 2 ACSR 493.</a>  Therefore it appears that upon the dissolution of Jagolmbe
in 1992 any entitlement which that company had as trustee to recover
a debt
from Graf Holdings or Parer came to be vested in the Commission.
<P>

25	Similarly, because of s 576 of the Corporations Law (as it then stood), the
Commission was the successor to any beneficial title
of Mary Victoria (and for
that matter any beneficial title which may have existed in Justbon and
Kemlat).
<P>

26	From 1 July 1998 the law with respect to deregistration to companies
changed.  Section 576 was repealed by Schedule 2 to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/clra1998210/" class="autolink_findacts">Company Law Review Act,
1998</a>.  Section 601AD(2) states that upon deregistration of a company, the
company's property vests in the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission, as it is now known.  Section 601AE(1) states that if property
vested in the Commission under s 601AD(2) was held by the
company in trust, the
Commission may continue to act as trustee or apply to the court for appointment
of a new trustee.  In my opinion
it is implied in s 601AE(1), when read with s
601AD(2), that the Commission must take one or other of those two courses, in
the sense
that if it does apply for the appointment of a new trustee, it is the
trustee under that provision.  The transitional provision found
in s 1438(1)
has the effect that property vested in the Commission before the change of the
law may be dealt with by the Commission
under the new law.
<P>

27	Section 601AH empowers the Commission and the court to reinstate the
registration of a company.  If the Commission does not do
so, the court may
make an order upon the application of a person aggrieved by the deregistration
or the former liquidator of the
company, provided the court is satisfied it is
just the company's registration be reinstated.  If the Commission therefore
does not
propose to act, there is a possibility that a person interested in
property of a deregistered company may seek to reinstate the company
so that
that interest may be protected and the company's rights pursued for the benefit
of the party interested.
<P>

28	Section 601AH is relevant to the present case in this way.  The
deregistration of the various companies makes it impossible for
the time being
for rights vested in those entities prior to the deregistration to be pursued
other than by the Commission.  However,
parties interested in property of a
deregistered entity (such as the entity's interest as a beneficiary of a trust)
may make an application
under s 601AH to reinstate the company so that it may
recover its property.  This possibility must be taken into account by the
plaintiff
in his administration of the two companies in liquidation, and by the
Court in the present proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The present application</b>
<P>

29	The plaintiff seeks an order under s 511(1) of the Corporations Law to the
effect that he would be justified in making distributions
out of the assets of
Graf Holdings and Parer on the basis that they are not indebted to the Trust or
to any person as trustee or
beneficiary of the Trust.  In the alternative, he
seeks an order that he would be so justified by reason of the notice which he
has
given to interested parties and the failure of the Commission to lodge a
proof of debt.
<P>

30	Originally the proceedings were brought ex parte.  As a result of a judgment
given by Windeyer J on 30 November 1998 and orders
subsequently made by his
Honour and me, the proceedings are now constituted as applications by the
liquidator as plaintiff in which
three parties are joined as defendants, namely
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, John Gerard Stewart and
Graf
Holdings No 4 Pty Ltd.  However, though they are now joined as parties,
none of the defendants has appeared at the hearing.
<P>

31	Section 511(1) is in the following terms:
<P>

	`511(1)  The liquidator, or any contributory or creditor, may apply to the
Court:
<P>

(a) 	to determine any question arising in the winding up of a company;  or
<P>

(b) 	to exercise all or any of the powers that the Court might exercise if the
company were being wound up by the Court.
<P>

	(2)  The Court, if satisfied that the determination of the question or the
exercise of power will be just and beneficial, may accede
wholly or partially
to any such application on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit or may
make such other order on the application
as it thinks just.'
<P>

32	The orders sought would not, as such, determine a question of law arising in
the winding up under s 511(1)(a).  The plaintiff
relies on s 511(1)(b), and
says that the orders are of a kind which a court would be empowered to make if
the companies were being
wound up by the court.  The plaintiff says that in a
winding up by the court, the court would have the power to make the orders he
seeks under s 479(3), which states the liquidator may apply for directions in
relation to any particular matter arising under the
winding up.
<P>

33	If directions are given to the liquidator and he has made full and fair
disclosure to the court of all material facts, whether
the directions are given
under s 511 or s 479, the liquidator may act in accordance with the directions
without thereby incurring
personal liability to creditors and contributories.
But the liquidator's protection from liability does not affect the rights of
creditors and contributors as between themselves: <i>Re G B Nathan &amp; Co Pty
Ltd (In Liquidation)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 672</a>, 679.
<P>

34	On its face s 511(1)(b) appears to put the court in the same position, as
regards its powers in a voluntary liquidation, as it
would be during a winding
up by the court.  However, a liquidator in a winding up by the court is an
officer of the court, whereas
in a voluntary liquidation the liquidator is an
agent of the company.  Additionally, s 511(2) requires that the court be
satisfied
that the exercise of power will be just and beneficial - there is no
equivalent wording in s 479.  The question arises whether those
differences are
points of real distinction.
<P>

35	In <i>Dean-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42
NSWLR 209</a>, Young J (at p 212) noted the different roles of a court-appointed
liquidator and a liquidator appointed in a voluntary winding up.
 He referred
to the case law which suggests that the court has the same jurisdiction under s
511 as under s 479(3), but said that
this cannot be completely true.  He
continued (at 212):
<P>

	`Although the court may under s 479 direct its officer to commit a breach of
trust or to do something which it is arguable he has
no  power to do, under s
511 the court is only given power to avoid expensive procedures but must act
according to law and not authorise
the liquidator to do anything which is ultra
vires the company.
<P>

Referring to the requirement of s 511(2) that the court is only to accede to
the liquidator's application if the exercise of the
power would be just and
beneficial, he said (also at 212):
<P>

	`... it seems to me that they plainly mean that the court has a discretion as
to whether making an order under the section will
be of advantage in the
liquidation.  There are many questions where the only order that the court
should make is that the liquidator
or the claimant proceed in the ordinary
courts in the ordinary way for the determination of a dispute.  However, there
are many other
situations where the court can summarily solve the difficulty
that has arisen in the liquidation by an order under the section in
a cheap and
efficient manner.  Where this can be done it is `just and beneficial' to
exercise the power.'
<P>

36	In my opinion the considerations affecting the exercise of the court's power
in a case such as the present are not limited by
the fact that the companies
are subject to voluntary winding up rather than winding up by the court.  This
is not a case where the
court is asked to sanction a course of conduct which is
identifiably beyond power, or in breach of trust.  I therefore do not need
to
decide whether to follow Young J to the extent that he may have taken the view
that such a sanctioning is permitted for a court-appointed
liquidator but not a
liquidator under a voluntary liquidation (compare <i>Re Campbell Coverings
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%202%20All%20ER%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] 2 All ER 74</a>, 78 per Evershed MR;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20All%20ER%20222" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] All ER 222).</a>
<P>

37	Section 511(1)(a) expressly authorises the court to determine a question of
law arising in the winding up, such as (for example)
whether debts have been
set off as a mutual obligation (<i>Re Parker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2080%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 80 FCR 1).</a>  Where,
however, the court is asked to give directions, the proceedings are of a
different kind.
<P>

38	Cases on s 479(3) indicate that the court should not use this provision to
make binding orders in the nature of judgments, seeking
to determine rights and
liabilities which have arisen out of the company's transactions before
liquidation (<i>Re G B Nathan &amp; Co Pty Ltd (In Liquidation)</i>, cited
above, at 679-80), though proceedings commenced as an application may sometimes
be converted into proceedings for the determination
of substantive rights.  In
the present case the orders which are sought do not purport to determine or
declare substantive rights.
 The question which they raise is whether the
liquidator's proposed course of conduct would be justified in all the
circumstances,
not whether the recipient of the distribution is entitled to it
as against the trustee of the Trust or potential beneficiaries: (compare
<i>Editions Tom Thompson Pty Ltd v Pilley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2077%20FCR%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 77 FCR 141</a>, 149G.)
<P>

39	It is true that if the liquidator makes a distribution in reliance on the
court's direction he will be protected from personal
liability and the true
beneficiaries (if there are any) will find it more difficult to recover their
entitlements.  This is because
they will then need to establish a right to
trace the assets distributed into the hands of the recipients (or even beyond
them) or
a right of recovery against the recipients personally.  But the
court's direction does not purport to determine their rights, and
leaves it
open for any beneficiary to seek to establish a right subsequently if permitted
by relevant limitation periods to do so.
 Proof an entitlement will necessarily
involve evidence not before the court in this application.
<P>

40	Further, the court's direction does not and cannot deprive a person claiming
an interest through a trustee or beneficiary which
is a deregistered company,
of the opportunity to apply to the Commission or the court to reinstate the
company under s 601AH.
<P>

41	I conclude, therefore, that the court's reluctance to determine substantive
rights in an application for directions is no impediment
to the present
proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The liquidator's duty and its discharge in the present</b> <b>case</b>
<P>

42	The liquidator has a duty to act impartially and a duty to discover who are
the creditors of the company:  <i>Re Autolook Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20ACLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) ACLR 409.</a>  A
liquidator is obliged to enquire into all claims.  There is a duty to ascertain
by direct enquiry whether a claim is being pressed
and the liquidator has a
duty not merely to advertise but to write to creditors of whose existence he is
aware:  <i>Harry Gourdias Pty Ltd v Port Adelaide Freezers Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%207%20ACSR%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 7
ACSR 303.</a>  The question is whether the plaintiff has conducted sufficient
investigations to discharge his duty in this case, as regards possible
claims
by the trustee or beneficiaries of the trust.
<P>

43	In the present case it is relevant, first, that Graf Holdings No 4 Pty Ltd
(In Liquidation) and Mr Stewart, who was the liquidator
of Mary Victoria and is
the liquidator of Graf Holdings No 4, are parties to the proceedings.  The
Commission is a party to the proceedings
as well, and is the statutory
inheritor of the assets of the deregistered companies, Mary Victoria, Jagolmbe,
Kemlat and Justbon.
<P>

44	In addition to joining relevant parties to the proceedings, the plaintiff in
this case has made quite extensive enquiries.  He
has placed advertisements in
a national newspaper.  He has corresponded with the Commission and with Mr
Stewart.  He has corresponded
with Mr Malouf, solicitor, who represents
Maryanne Menzies, who was the principal executive officer of Mary Victoria, and
a director
of the company for a time, and was a signatory to annual accounts.
He has also corresponded with Ms Patricia Keith, who is the solicitor
for Ailsa
Mansell, a shareholder in Graf Holdings.  Ms Keith located records with the
widow of Mr Langham-Dale, the deceased solicitor
who had acted for Mr Graf.
The plaintiff has kept the Commission, Mr Malouf and Ms Keith informed of the
state of the proceedings
and has served on each of them a copy of the
application in its final form.
<P>

45	In my opinion it is fair to say that by taking these steps, the plaintiff
has done everything which could reasonably be expected
to advertise and to deal
with those who might be anticipated to have claims.  I therefore conclude that
the plaintiff has discharged
his duty as liquidator of the two companies to
make proper investigations concerning the Trust and to notify potential
claimants
in respect of the Trust.
<P>

	<b>Responses of potential claimants</b>
<P>

46	I should note the evidence concerning the responses of those who were
notified of the proceedings.  In each case the plaintiff's
solicitor supplied
the potential claimant with copies of the amended summons and the relevant
affidavits.  All claimants had the
benefit of legal advice.  In these
circumstances I regard the disclosure to them as adequate.
<P>

47	By a letter dated 25 February 1999 the Commission informed the plaintiff's
solicitor that `it is a stranger to the action and
does not wish to contest the
orders sought by your client'.
<P>

48	On 9 February 1999 Mr Stewart informed the plaintiff's solicitor that he
intended to provide copies of the relevant documents
to all the shareholders of
Graf Holdings No.4, to advise them that he did not propose to take any action,
and to give them until
12 February 1999 to notify him of any claims which they
may wish to make.  By a letter dated 12 February 1999 he informed the
plaintiff's
solicitor that he intended to take no further action on his own
behalf or as liquidator of Graf Holdings No.4, and that he did not
intend to
appear at the hearing.
<P>

49	By a letter dated 12 February 1999 Mr Malouf informed the plaintiff's
solicitor that he was instructed to take no further action
on behalf of his
client Maryanne Menzies to recover any amount that may be owing by the Trust to
Mary Victoria.  I take this to include
any amount which may be owing by it as
trustee by virtue of its duty to get in trust assets and distribute the assets
to the beneficiaries.
 Mr Malouf indicated that he did not intent to appear at
the hearing.
<P>

50	By a letter dated 22 February 1999 written on behalf of Ailsa Mansell, Ms
Keith advised the plaintiff's solicitors that her client
had instructed her
that she did not wish to take part in the proceedings.
<P>

	<b>Regulation 5.6.48</b>
<P>

51	One particular matter which the plaintiff relies upon in this case is that
as liquidator of Graf Holdings and Parer, he has given
notice in writing
pursuant to reg 5.6.48(1) of the Corporations Regulations for formal proofs of
debt or claims to be lodged.  Notice
was given by advertisement in a national
newspaper.  Specific notice was given to the Commission as the successor in
title of the
trustee, Jagolmbe.  The plaintiff submits that it follows from the
giving of those notices, by virtue of sub-reg 5.6.48(4), that
if the Commission
was otherwise a creditor or claimant of Graf Holdings or Parer, then the
Commission's failure to lodge a proof
of debt in accordance with the
liquidator's requirements, or otherwise to object to distribution, has the
consequence that it is
properly to be excluded from the benefit of the
distribution to be made.
<P>

52	I would prefer not to express any concluded opinion about this submission,
especially in view of the absence of any contradictor
in the present
proceedings.  It seems to me to be unnecessary for the plaintiff to rely upon
reg 5.6.48(4), in view of my findings
as to the scope of s 511(1)(b) and the
plaintiff's discharge of his duty of investigation.  My hesitation arises
because whatever
may be the effect of reg 5.6.48, there exist in the
Corporations Law other avenues by which a party such as the Commission could
seek to challenge a distribution notwithstanding the giving of notice under the
regulation.  I have in mind, in particular, s 601AH
which permits both the
Commission and the court to reinstate a deregistered company.  This power is
expressed in relevantly unqualified
terms and, if exercised, could be used to
resuscitate a claim and possibly even to override the excluding effect of reg
5.6.48(4).
<P>

	<b>Conclusions and orders</b>
<P>

53	In all these circumstances the question which falls for decision is whether
this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should
give directions of the
kind sought by the plaintiff under s 511(1)(b).  There being no relevant
impediment to my doing so, my decision
is essentially a discretionary one.  I
have decided that it is appropriate in the special circumstances of this case
to give directions
of the kind sought, but I emphasise that the circumstances
of this case are special indeed.  It seems to me that s 511(1)(b) should
not be
used by a liquidator in a voluntary winding up to obtain protection and
reassurance from the court whenever some doubt arises
in the course of
administration of the company's affairs.
<P>

54	What makes the present case special is the combination of the following
factors:
<P>

	(a)	The question which is put to the Court for decision relates to whether the
liquidator is justified in making the distribution,
and does not require the
Court to make any determination of rights or entitlements;
<P>

	(b)	The proceedings have been constituted in proper form and those persons who
might reasonably be anticipated to have any interest
in the outcome have been
joined as parties, and therefore the difficulties that may arise in an ex parte
application are avoided;
<P>

	(c)	The attitude to the proceedings taken by the other parties, and
particularly the Australian Securities and Investments Commission,
which says
it regards itself as a stranger to the proceedings;
<P>

	(d)	None of the defendants has appeared and there is no identified opponent to
the directions which are sought;
<P>

	(e)	The liquidator has made all reasonable enquiries and has contacted all
known parties who may wish to make a claim;
<P>

	(f)	The affairs of the relevant companies appear not to have been properly
documented and recorded and, in view of the lapse of
time since relevant
events, it is entirely understandable the liquidator may find himself in a
position of real uncertainty of a
kind which cannot be resolved by relevant
enquiry.
<P>

55	I therefore make orders 1 and 4 in the summons in each matter.
<P>
