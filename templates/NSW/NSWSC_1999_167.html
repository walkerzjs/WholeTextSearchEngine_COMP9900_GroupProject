<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY 4 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1560/99 - ACP PUBLISHING PTY LTD V PACIFIC PUBLICATIONS PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    This is an unusual application for an interlocutory
injunction by the proprietor of one women's interest magazine against the
proprietor of another.
<P>

2	The plaintiff has published in its magazine what it says is an interview
between a Mr Golden and a Ms Lewinsky.  The defendant
has published on radio
station 3AW that in its view that interview never took place and the plaintiff
has just published the result
of a hoax.
<P>

3	The plaintiff says that such a statement injures it in its reputation, and
may very well, merely because it may lead people who
would ordinarily buy its
magazine not to buy it, cause irreparable damage to the standing of its
magazine as a competitor to the
defendant's magazine.
<P>

4	Especially in cases where there is likely to be a good deal of publicity,
courts must be very careful before granting interlocutory
injunctions.  A
reason for this is that it is so easy for the public to misunderstand what the
court's task is on these applications.
 The court merely sees whether the
plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried and how the
status quo can be
held pending the time the court can deal with the case.
<P>

5	A major factor in whether to make an order is the length of time that it will
take for the case to come on for hearing.  If it
is only a matter of a short
time, then one is dealing with a different scenario than if it is going to be
some months before a case
can come on before the court.
<P>

6	After a little negotiation, it would seem that as a result of a case settling
in my list next week we can try this case finally
on Wednesday, 10 March 1999,
with the aid of video link evidence from London and New York.  Accordingly, I
am only dealing with a
time gap of about five days.
<P>

7	I should mention that the plaintiff applied to the Chief Judge ex parte on
Tuesday and obtained an order preventing the defendant
representing to the
public, or to other publishers or broadcasters, that the relevant interview was
a hoax or otherwise fictitious.
 The plaintiff seeks to extend that order up
until the hearing.  It says that there is a justifiable fear of repetition and
that
such repetition may very well cause irreparable damage to the standing of
the magazine.
<P>

8	However, there are a large number of factors which tell against doing that.
The first is that to an extent the cat is already
out of the bag, in that there
has been publication on a Victorian radio station of the defendant's
allegation.
<P>

9	Secondly, there is great difficulty in framing an  injunction which does not
allow the defendant to escape by the various alternative
methods of getting its
message across.  One has only got to remember how the relevant media were able
to publish the transcript of
the <b>Lady Chatterley's Lover case</b> to see
that this is so.
<P>

10	Thirdly, there is a general reluctance in this Court to grant any injunction
which will prevent free speech, which is the right
of every Australian, and
injunctions are usually granted only in the special sort of cases that are
mentioned in<b> Chappell v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 153.</a>
<P>

11	Fourthly, I am not convinced of the correctness of the statement that the
plaintiff is likely to suffer damage even if the statement
was repeated.  There
is no allegation that the plaintiff has acted otherwise than in good faith and
if a hoax has been perpetrated
on it, the Australian readership is just as
likely to shrug it off as to say that they consider that the standing of the
magazine
has been damaged.
<P>

12	Finally, there are only five days before a full hearing, the message has
already got out, and I cannot see such damage as would
justify the making of a
further restraint.
<P>

13	Accordingly, I decline to give interim relief.  If it appears that, for a
reason other than problems on the plaintiff's side
of the record, the case
cannot be heard next Wednesday, perhaps it may have to be revisited.
<P>

14	I have not heretofore mentioned the question of a prima facie case or
serious question to be tried.  If the plaintiff's evidence
is believed then,
with one exception, the plaintiff would seem to have shown that there is a
serious question to be tried that there
actually was an interview between
Andrew Golden and Monica Lewinsky.  The exception is that the affidavit of Mr
O'Brien, a solicitor
acting for the plaintiff, does not indicate anything more
than that Mr Golden was actually sitting at a table whilst other people
were
talking.  Mr Golden's own affidavit says in paras 16 and 17 that he put
questions to Ms Lewinsky and she answered them.  There
is, of course, quite a
difference between a meeting and an interview, and a difference between an
interview and being present and
overhearing what other people said; see<b>
Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Thomas Borthwick &amp; Sons
(Pacific) Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2032%20FCR%2028" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 32 FCR 28</a>, 33.
<P>

15	It may be that the plaintiff will feel that it should supplement this
material and that is why I point out this particular problem.
<P>

16	In view of what has been said by counsel on both sides, it is necessary that
the issues be defined by pleadings.
<P>

17	Accordingly I direct that:
<P>

1.    The plaintiff is to file and serve a duly verified statement of claim no
later than 4pm on Friday 5 March 1999.
<P>

	2.    The defendant is to file and serve a duly verified defence no later than
4pm on 8 March 1999.
<P>

3.     I note that apart from the question as to whether there was an
interview, no further evidence is intended at this stage to
be filed by the
plaintiff.
<P>

4.    The defendant's affidavits are to be served no later than 6pm on 8 March
1999.
<P>

5.     I will provisionally fix the hearing before me at 10am on Wednesday, 10
March 1999; and
<P>

6.     In the circumstances I will reserve the costs of  today until the
hearing.
<P>

7.     Upon the plaintiff by its counsel giving to the court the usual
undertaking as to damages, I extend the Chief Judge's order
until 6pm tonight
so that the plaintiff can consider its avenues as to appeal.
<P>

 
<P>

 	                             o0o
<P>
