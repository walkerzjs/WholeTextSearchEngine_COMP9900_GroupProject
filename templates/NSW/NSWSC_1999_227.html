<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The late John Newman was murdered on 5 September 1994.  He left
an estate comprising his home at 15 Woods Avenue
Cabramatta, furniture, a motor
vehicle, money and securities to the value of about $50,000.00, and
superannuation then estimated
to be around $180,000.00.  By his last will dated
3 January 1992, Mr Newman appointed Sam D'Ambrosio as executor, gave the home
and
its contents to his mother, $100,000.00 to his brother, $10,000.00 each to
three friends, and the residue for a proposed charitable
purpose.
<P>

2	At the time of his death, Mr Newman's fiancee Lucy Wang resided with him at
the Woods Avenue property, and she continued to reside
there for some time
after his death.  On 25 January 1995 Miss Wang commenced proceedings under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> against Mr D'Ambrosio, claiming provision out of the
estate.  On 13 July 1995, Mr D'Ambrosio commenced proceedings against Miss
Wang,
claiming possession of the Woods Avenue property.  In about October 1995,
Miss Wang left the property, and the proceedings are now
being pursued with a
view to claiming damages or rent from the date of Mr Newman's death.
<P>

3	I am dealing now with Miss Wang's claim under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>, and
Mr D'Ambrosio's claim for a little over $11,000.00 rent plus about $3,600.00
interest.
<P>

	<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

4	I will commence by giving an outline of the facts. 
<P>

5	Mr Newman and Miss Wang met in about March 1993.  Mr Newman had been born in
1948, had married in 1972, and had a son in 1973.
 In 1979, Mr Newman's wife
and son were killed in a car crash.  He entered New South Wales Parliament as
the member for Cabramatta
in 1986, and he continued in that role until his
death. His will was made in January 1992.
<P>

6	Miss Wang was born in China in 1966.  In January 1990, she married one Jian
Lui in China. In May the same year, she came to Australia
to undertake a
Bachelor of Arts Degree at Macquarie University.  It seems that she returned to
China for a short time in March 1993,
at which time she agreed to a divorce
with Jian Lui.  In April 1993, Miss Wang graduated as a Bachelor of Arts.  She
commenced working
for Mr Newman in his electoral office doing contract
translation work.  From a little after this time, Mr Newman and Miss Wang began
going out together, and later in the year Mr Newman proposed taking her on a
trip to China.
<P>

7	In November 1993, Miss Wang accompanied Mr Newman as his partner and
translator on a two-week Parliamentary delegation to China.
 It is clear that
on this trip they shared hotel rooms, and that there was a sexual relationship
between them.  Mr Newman was introduced
to Miss Wang's parents in China.
According to Miss Wang she was, on this trip, introduced to people as Mr
Newman's wife. 
<P>

8	Also in November, Miss Wang commenced full-time employment with Oceania
English College Belmore, as a secretary. 
<P>

9	Towards the end of the year, it appears that Mr Newman found out for the
first time about Miss Wang's marriage, and was very concerned
about this.
However, it appears that ultimately he accepted Miss Wang's explanation about
the matter. 
<P>

10	In December 1993 or January 1994, Miss Wang commenced to live with Mr
Newman. From about the time she moved in, or perhaps shortly
afterwards, they
slept together in the main bedroom, and it is clear that there was a sexual
relationship between them.
<P>

11	Mr Newman's mother, Mrs Neumenko, continued however to come regularly to the
house as she had in the past, on about two days
a week, to do cleaning and
washing.  This continued until about February 1994, when she broke her hip; and
from that time until about
May 1994, she did not come.  After May 1994, she
resumed coming to the house and doing the cleaning and washing.
<P>

12	In January 1994, Miss Wang ceased her employment with Oceania English
College, and commenced to work in Mr Newman's electoral
office three days a
week, for which she was paid $450.00 nett per fortnight.  
<P>

13	It seems that in April 1994, Miss Wang did obtain a divorce in China from
Jian Lui.
<P>

14	In May 1994, Mr Newman wrote a letter to the plaintiff's father in China,
reading as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>I write to extend my greetings again to you, your dear wife and
family.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Xiao Jing and I are getting along very well and learning to understand
each other.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I hope you are well and that the winter in China was not too
cold.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Xiao jing and I hope to visit you again in October 1994.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Mr. Wang, I am very much in love with your daughter and hope she will
stay with me forever.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Your daughter still needs to look after her health.  I am doing my best
to give her Vitamins and ensure that she eats the right food.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Xiao jing's health is better now but still needs improvement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Please write and tell her to take greater care of her health.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	My life is much happier being with your daughter.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Until we meet again I express my best wishes to you and your
family.</i></b>
<P>

'Xiao Jing' is Miss Wang.
<P>

15	On 9 May 1994 Mr Newman asked Miss Wang to marry him, and he gave her and
she accepted an engagement ring.  Some time after that,
there was a proposal
for an engagement party; but that was cancelled, apparently due to working
commitments of Mr Newman.
<P>

16	Between 17 and 30 May 1994, Mr Newman and Miss Wang went together to France
to attend a Karate meeting, and, on that occasion,
they visited relatives of Mr
Newman in Switzerland. 
<P>

17	In July 1994, Mr Newman and some colleagues, being members of the Stay Safe
Committee, went to the United States and the United
Kingdom to look into police
matters.  There is an affectionate letter from him to Miss Wang dated 22 July
1994, sent from Los Angeles,
which concludes with the words "I miss you, all my
love". 
<P>

18	In August 1994, there was a meeting of the Cabramatta Branch of the
Australian Labor Party chaired by Mr D'Ambrosio.  According
to Miss Wang, Mr
Newman was unhappy about what happened at the meeting, and afterwards said he
did not trust Mr D'Ambrosio and that
he must change his will.  About the same
time, according to Miss Wang, the deceased said he would make a new will
leaving everything
to her.
<P>

19	According to a fellow Member of Parliament, Mr Peter Nagle, at a function at
Parliament House on a Saturday about 26 August (which
appears to have been the
27 August 1994), Mr Newman discussed his wedding plans with him.  On the
Thursday before the murder, (that
would appear to be 1 September) Mr. Newman
telephoned Mr Nagle, and discussed plans for the honeymoon.  As I have
mentioned Mr Newman
was murdered on 5 September.
<P>

20	In December 1994, Miss Wang was granted permanent resident status by the
Australian Government. 
<P>

21	As I mentioned, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> proceedings were commenced on 23
January 1995.  On 31 March 1995, whilst Miss Wang was overseas, Mr D'Ambrosio
entered the house
and changed the locks.  However, Miss Wang retook possession
in April 1995. 
<P>

22	Probate of the estate was granted to Mr D'Ambrosio on 30 May 1995, and on 30
July he commenced the possession proceedings.  As
I have already mentioned,
Miss Wang left the property in about October 1995.
<P>

23	In 1996, a book written by Miss Wang was published.  According to her
evidence, she received something between $20,000.00 and
$30,000.00 for this
book.  In about September 1996, she commenced employment with UHI Winko Pty
Ltd, for which employment she was
paid $700.00 per week gross.  It appears that
this employment finished in about mid 1997. 
<P>

24	At about that time Miss Wang went to Western Australia, and became a
shareholder and director of a company Asian Buffet Club
Pty Limited, which ran
a restaurant at Rockingham.  It appears Miss Wang invested $50,000.00 in that
enterprise, being a sum she
had been awarded by the Victim's Compensation
Tribunal.  The restaurant closed in 1997 and was sold.  According to Miss Wang,
her
investment was lost. 
<P>

25	Miss Wang returned to Sydney in January 1998.  The inquest into Mr Newman's
death took place in February/March 1998.  Miss Wang
had legal representation at
that inquest.  Apart from $10,000.00 which she paid, it appears that she was
represented on a contingency
basis, and there is evidence that, if she is
successful in these proceedings there is an amount of $60,000.00 which is
claimed from
her in respect of legal representation at the inquest. 
<P>

26	In 1998 Miss Wang was employed by The Asian Pacific Group.  This group,
among other things, paid her rent and travelling expenses
in relation to trips
to China and the USA.  In March 1999, she enrolled in a computer programming
course and a MBA Course at the
University of Technology, Sydney.  She says she
has few assets.
<P>

27	Since Mr Newman's death, the estate has received the superannuation payment,
which turned out to be around $240,000.00; about
$40,000.00 in rent from the
estate house, out of which there have been some expenses; tax of $31,500.00 has
been paid, storage fees
of $7,000.00 have been paid and it appears that legal
cost of $184,000.00 have been paid to the defendant's legal advisers.  It
appears
that there are orders against the plaintiff to pay some legal costs of
the defendant, amounting to around $8,000.00.  According to
the defendant's
legal representatives, there is something over $33,000.00 still to be paid
arising out of this hearing.  The plaintiff's
legal costs are said to amount to
around $60,000.00 on a contingency basis.  It is common ground that the house
property is worth
about $240,000.00.
<P>

28	I have been provided with no evidence of the financial circumstances of Mrs
Neumenko.  There is some evidence of the financial
circumstances of Mr Newman's
brother, to the following effect.  He is in reasonable employment.  His
principal asset is land at Fairfield
worth $100,000.00, in respect of which he
has entered into a contract for $130,00.00 to build a house.  He expects to
meet that by
a mortgage of $100,000.00, and with some investments held by his
wife.  The material about Mr Newman's brother does not indicate
that he has any
children, although there is reference to a step-daughter. There is no clear
statement of his wife's financial position.

<P>

	<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

29	I will now deal with the issues that have been raised in the case.  Firstly,
there are some issues concerning evidence in the
case, and the credibility of
witnesses.  Secondly, there are questions arising under the possession
proceedings.  Thirdly, there
is the question whether Miss Wang is an eligible
person in relation to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> claim.  Fourthly, there is the
question whether the provision she has had from Mr Newman and his estate is
inadequate for her proper
maintenance, education and advancement in life.
Fifthly, if I am otherwise in favour of a provision being made, what is the
amount
of the provision which should be made.
<P>

	<b><u>EVIDENCE AND CREDIBILITY</u></b>
<P>

30	Dealing first with matters concerning evidence and credibility, I will
mention first a number of particular witnesses about whom
no particular
question of credibility was raised. 
<P>

31	A neighbour Mrs Wilson gave evidence that, in about January 1994, the
deceased said that he was going away, and there would be
a Chinese student at
the house, and she was not to be concerned about that.  Mrs Wilson also gave
evidence of hearing Mr Newman shout,
at some time after the engagement was
announced, the words "I am not going to marry you". 
<P>

32	Friends of Mr Newman, Mr and Mrs Gotovac, gave some evidence.  Mr Gotovac's
evidence included evidence about the domestic work
done by Mrs Neumenko, and
complaints were made about Miss Wang.  He said he was introduced to Miss Wang
in February 1994 as Mr Newman's
receptionist, and he said that Mr Newman never
told him he intended to marry Miss Wang.
<P>

33	A solicitor, Miss Green, gave evidence that in late 1993 Mr Newman asked
about the legal position if Miss Wang moved in; and
he was apparently reassured
by being told it would be two years before there was a problem, unless she had
a child.
<P>

34	A friend, Mr Huynh said that, some time after the return from the trip to
China, Mr Newman had expressed concern to him that
Miss Wang had "hid" her
marriage from him.
<P>

35	On behalf of the plaintiff, a fellow MP Mr Nagle gave evidence about Miss
Wang's help to Mr Newman in political gatherings. 
He gave evidence of very
close contact with Mr Newman over the months of 1994, and that all remarks that
Mr Newman made about Miss
Wang were remarks of love, affection and kindness.
He said, prior to his association with Miss Wang, Mr Newman had been quick to
temper and that subsequently he was calmer and happier.
<P>

36	Another MP, Christopher Hartley, gave evidence that Mr. Newman on 31st
August 1994 conveyed in no uncertain terms that he was
getting married soon.

<P>

37	As I have said, there was little controversy about the evidence of those
witnesses, and I see no reason why I should not accept
all that evidence.
<P>

38	Mrs Neumenko gave evidence that, in about December 1993, Mr. Newman spoke of
Miss Wang coming to the house, in terms that she
was a guest and there was a
spare room downstairs; and she also gave evidence of some talk by Miss Wang
about problems with accommodation.
 She says that, after Miss Wang moved in,
she did the same domestic duties as before, and indeed she did more because she
did work
for Miss Wang as well.  She gave evidence that there were many
arguments, in fact that there were arguments between Mr Newman and
Miss Wang on
most occasions when she went to the house.  She gave evidence that after the
engagement, Mr Newman said to her "I have
made a mistake with Lucy, I cannot
marry her"; and also words to the effect "The quicker I get that woman out of
the house the better".
 On another occasion he said to Miss Wang "No way am I
going to marry you".  In my opinion, that evidence does support the view that
there were arguments, but I cannot regard it as a balanced account of Mrs
Neumenko's observations of the relationship.  In my opinion,
evidence that I
accept, including the objective evidence of letters and the evidence of persons
like Mr Nagle, make it clear that
on the whole the relationship was a close and
loving relationship.  It seems to me that the evidence given by Mrs Neumenko
has been
given selectively, and with the intention of presenting as
unsatisfactory a picture as possible of the relationship. 
<P>

39	Mr D'Ambrosio gave evidence that on each occasion before Mr Newman went
away, including July 1994, he reminded him about the
will and asked him to look
after his mother.  He gave evidence of statements by Mr Newman, in about
December 1993 and early 1994,
that Miss Wang only moved into his house for some
reason of appearance.  He gave evidence that in August 1994, Mr Newman said
words
to the effect that Miss Wang was going overseas and he would find a unit
for her, and when she came back she was going to find herself
there.  There was
a challenge made to Mr D'Ambrosio's loyalty to the deceased, in terms of
association with the deceased's political
rivals.  In my opinion that challenge
to Mr D'Ambrosio did fail completely.  However, in my opinion, Mr D'Ambrosio in
the manner
and content of his evidence showed very considerable animus against
the plaintiff:  for example, his evidence attempting to throw
doubt on the
continuance of the engagement, and his ultimate reluctant acceptance of
insulting words about the plaintiff at the time
possession was recovered of the
property.  I have to say that I considered his evidence did not give anything
like a balanced picture
of the relationship, and I am not satisfied that the
words he claimed to have had said to him in August 1994 were said in the way,
or having the implication that he has suggested.
<P>

40	As regards Miss Wang, it was submitted by Mr Dupree that in her statement to
the police and in her book her account was different
from that given in the
witness box, and did not support the existence of the kind of relationship
which would make her an eligible
person.  He took me in some detail through the
pages of the book, but I was unable to detect any inconsistency between what
was said
in the book and what she said in evidence.  He did submit that Miss
Wang made a claim that she was already Mr Newman's de facto wife
at the time of
the visit to China; and he referred me to a question where it was put to her
that she was not Mr Newman's wife at
that time, to which she replied "I
regarded I was".  Again, I do not regard that as inconsistent with what is now
claimed.  I accept
her evidence that, on that occasion, she was introduced as
Mr Newman's wife, although I also accept that it could not be said that
a
domestic relationship of husband and wife had been established at that stage.
I do not think that the question and answer referred
to does indicate anything
substantially different being claimed by Miss Wang.
<P>

41	Mr Dupree also submitted that Miss Wang's disclosure of her business
activities and financial affairs, since Mr Newman's death,
was unsatisfactory.
He submitted there was no forthright explanation concerning the remuneration
for her book.  He submitted that
there was no adequate account given of the
various companies she had been involved in.  In particular, he pointed out that
Asian
Buffet Club was not in liquidation but was continuing, with the plaintiff
still a director and holding thirty-five thousand shares.
 He referred to other
companies such as Co-Cyber Pty Ltd, in which Miss Wang has seventy-five or one
hundred shares, and UHI Winko,
in which she appeared to be the sole director
and the centre of the corporate structure.  He pointed to the business name
Ausqueen,
and to what he submitted was her unsatisfactory evidence that it just
helped Mr Newman for taxation purposes.
<P>

42	In my opinion, the evidence given by Miss Wang about her financial
activities is not as full and precise as perhaps it should
have been.  However,
I am satisfied that her evidence to the effect that these various activities
have not left her with any substantial
assets should be accepted.  These
activities have provided her with a living over the last few years.  She has
been assisted in this
by the payments she received for the book, and also by
the money from the Victim's Compensation Tribunal.  I accept in substance
that
has been lost, and that the company, Asian Buffet Club having sold the
restaurant and apparently paid out creditors under a
deed of company
arrangement, is not any longer a company of any substance.
<P>

	<b><u>POSSESSION PROCEEDINGS</u></b>
<P>

43	I turn now to consider the possession proceedings.  
<P>

44	Mr Dupree submitted that any licence Miss Wang may have had to live in the
property was revoked by the death of Mr Newman and
he referred me to <u>Public
Trustee v. Belotti</u> (1986) 4 BPR 9196 and <u>Richardson v Greentree</u>,
unreported 1st December 1997, Einstein, J.  He submitted that the evidence did
not show any permission to Miss Wang to stay in the
premises, and that
accordingly she was liable for damages or rent for the whole of the period
between the death of Mr Newman and
her leaving the premises. 
<P>

45	Mr Wilson referred to an affidavit sworn by Mr D'Ambrosio on 31 March 1995,
the day on which he changed the locks and excluded
Miss Wang from the premises.
In that affidavit Mr D'Ambrosio swore:  "I have, in my capacity as executor to
Mr Newman's estate, currently
allowed the plaintiff to reside at Mr Newman's
home until the plaintiff's summons is determined by the court".
<P>

46	Mr Wilson submitted that that made it clear that, at least until action was
taken to exclude Miss Wang, she did have permission
to stay in the house, and
should not be treated as a trespasser or liable for rent. 
<P>

47	In my opinion, it is clear that, subject to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> claim,
Miss Wang did become a trespasser when she went back into the premises and,
subject to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> claim, she would be liable to damages
quantified by reference to a reasonable rent from then until the time she left.
I am not satisfied,
having regard to what was sworn by Mr D'Ambrosio, that she
is liable for rent for any earlier period.
<P>

	<b><u>ELIGIBLE PERSON</u></b>
<P>

48	The next question is whether Miss Wang is an eligible person within the
meaning of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.  That expression is defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6</a> of the
Act in the following terms: 
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>	"eligible person", in relation to a deceased person, means:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	a person who:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(i)	was the wife or husband of the deceased person at the time of the
deceased person's death;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(ii)	where the deceased person was a man, was a woman who, at the time
of his death, was living with the deceased person as his wife
on a bona fide
domestic basis; or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(iii)	where the deceased person was a woman, was man who, at the time of
her death, was living with the deceased person as her husband
on a bona fide
domestic basis;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	a child of the deceased person;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(c)	a former wife or husband of the deceased person; or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(d)	a person:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(i)	who was, at any particular time, wholly or partly dependent upon the
deceased person; and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(ii)	who is a grandchild of the deceased person or was, at that
particular time or at any other time, a member of a household of
which the
deceased person was a member.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

49	Mr Wilson for the plaintiff has provided a written outline of submissions.

<P>

50	He submitted that at the date of death Miss Wang was living with Mr Newman
as his wife on a bona fide domestic basis, and he
referred to the test as
enunciated in <u>Roy v. Sturgeon</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSW%20LR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSW LR 454.</a>  He submitted that
the parties had lived in the same household for over eight months, and that the
relationship did not finish but
came to an end as a result of Mr Newman's
death, and in that regard, I was referred to <u>McKenna v. Solomon</u>,
unreported decision of the Court of Appeal, 9 December 1994, per Kirby, P. at
page 8.  He submitted there was a sexual relationship
and, to the extent that
the plaintiff's income permitted, there was a degree of financial
interdependence.  All of Mr Newman's property,
particularly his residence and
motor vehicle, were available for use by the plaintiff.  There were no
children, but this was a topic
of discussion.  The plaintiff assisted the
deceased as a homemaker, and made a contribution as hostess and political ally.
There
was substantial mutual commitment and support, and the fact that they
planned to marry in March 1995 after the next election was
not inconsistent
with their status as de facto husband and wife.  Their engagement and proposed
marriage had a high public profile.
<P>

51	Alternatively, Mr Wilson submitted that the plaintiff fell within a
different category of eligible person, namely, that she was
a member of the
deceased's household and was partially dependent on the deceased for financial
necessities:  see <u>Petrohilas v. Hunter</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSW%20LR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSW LR 343</a> at 346.
<P>

52	Mr Dupree submitted that the decisions relating to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto
Relationships Act</a> could not necessarily be applied to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.
He referred to the definitions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto Relationships Act</a> and
particularly the definition of "de facto partner", as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>de facto partner means:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	in relation to a man, a woman who is living or has lived with a man
as his wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not married
to him,
and</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	in relation to a woman, a man who is living or has lived with the
woman as her husband on a bona fide domestic basis although
not married to
her.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

53	He submitted, because there was no use of the word "de facto" in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> but only use of the word "wife", a higher test was required to
bring a person within the definition in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.  He submitted
that, in particular, there had to be a mutual mental element, an acceptance by
both that Miss Wang was living with
Mr Newman as his wife.  He submitted that
it was appropriate that a higher test be imposed, because of the problems of
opposing a
claim brought against a deceased estate. 
<P>

54	Mr Dupree submitted that in any event the test laid down under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto
Relationships Act</a> in cases such as <u>D v. McA</u> (1986) 11 FLR 214 had not
been satisfied.  There was no combination of financial resources, or holding
out to the community of the
status of husband and wife, only the status of an
engaged couple.  The relationship was only about eight months, and the evidence
about arguments and various statements by the deceased indicated that it did
not have a character of stability and permanence.  He
pointed to material from
Miss Wang's book suggesting that the relationship developed gradually to
becoming ultimately one where she
was a fiancee, which was not the same as a de
facto partner.  He pointed to a failure to call witnesses who could have
supported
the plaintiff's claim, such as Mr Gibson and Mr Hazard.  He submitted
that there was no evidence that, during 1994, Miss Wang was
ever introduced as
Mr Newman's wife.  
<P>

55	I do not accept that any different test applies under the relevant
definition in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> than that which applies under the
similar definition in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto Relationships Act</a>.
<P>

56	In my opinion, the fact that the public presentation of the relationship was
that of an engaged couple is by no means inconsistent
with it being true that
Miss Wang was, at the time of Mr Newman's death, living with him as his wife on
a bona fide domestic basis.
 In my opinion, the factors referred to by Mr
Wilson do strongly support the view that that indeed was the situation.  They
had been
living together substantially as if they were husband and wife from
January 1994 until 5 September 1994.  There was very substantial
mutual
support, there was very substantial common use of property.  It seems to me
that the fact that they intended to marry a little
time in the future confirms
that there was a degree of mutual commitment, which supports rather than
conflicts with the existence
of the required relationship.  I am satisfied that
they were committed to marry each other, and that this commitment was very
genuine
on both sides.  I am satisfied that the requirements of paragraph a(ii)
of the definition of eligible person are satisfied.
<P>

	<b><u>INADEQUATE PROVISION</u></b>
<P>

57	The next question is whether I am satisfied, in terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a>, that the provision made for Miss Wang is inadequate for her
proper maintenance, education and advancement in life. 
<P>

58	Mr Wilson referred me to<u> Singer v. Berghouse</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a>, and
submitted that I ought have regard to Miss Wang's financial position, the size
of the estate, the totality of the relationship
between Miss Wang and the
deceased, and other persons who have legitimate claims upon the deceased's
bounty.  He submitted that I
should not be satisfied there were any persons,
apart from the plaintiff, who had such a legitimate claim.  He referred me to
<u>Re Fulop Deceased</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSW%20LR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSW LR 679</a> at 681. 
<P>

59	He submitted that Miss Wang was left without adequate provision because she
had financial needs in the form of requiring a residence,
paying University
fees, requiring a motor vehicle, paying debts, and having a fund to cover day
to day expenses and vicissitudes.
 Further, the nature, duration and intensity
of the relationship was such that the deceased ought to have made provision;
the plaintiff's
contribution to the welfare of the deceased had been
substantial; the estate was of sufficient size; and that the deceased could
comfortably provide for the plaintiff.
<P>

60	Mr Dupree submitted that the onus was on the plaintiff to bring satisfactory
evidence to the court to show her financial circumstances
and thus to show her
need.  He submitted that I could conclude that the plaintiff was astute,
entrepreneurial and skilful, and had
been involved in many businesses.  The
evidence she had produced about those businesses was insufficient for the court
to come to
a satisfactory conclusion about her needs.  I have already briefly
outlined some of those submissions in dealing with the question
of her ability.
He submitted that I could infer that her resignation from the Asian Pacific
Group and application to undertake further
study was calculated as presenting a
picture of need. 
<P>

61	He submitted that debts the plaintiff alleged to have to friends had not
been proved. He submitted that the plaintiff had not
shown there was any
necessity to incur legal costs in relation to the inquest.  There had been no
accusation brought against her
by the police or any official person, and it was
not shown to be at all necessary for her to have incurred those costs.  He
referred
me to evidence where the plaintiff said that she had some suspicion of
the police, and talked about being under police supervision;
and he submitted
that this did not suggest any reasonable basis for incurring the costs.  He
also pointed to her success in providing
for herself over the last few years,
the $50,000.00 she received from the Victim's Compensation Tribunal, the
$24,000.00 to $30,000.00
she received from the book.  He submitted that there
was evidence of proceedings contemplated against the State of New South Wales
in respect of the death of Mr Newman, and that too he submitted was a matter
that should have been disclosed and explained in order
to have a full
appreciation of the plaintiff's financial position.
<P>

62	In my opinion, the plaintiff Miss Wang did have a legitimate claim on the
bounty of Mr Newman, by reason of being his de facto
spouse, by reason of the
commitment to marry that they had both undertaken and continued with, and by
reason of eight months of very
significant mutual support.  Upon Mr Newman's
death she was left with no place to live.  As submitted by Mr Dupree, it
appears that
any licence she had to remain in the house was revoked, so she was
liable to be immediately evicted.  She had no substantial assets
of her own.  I
think it is fair to say that she did have substantial skills and
resourcefulness to make her own way in the world,
but I do not consider that
that means that she did not need provision for proper maintenance education and
advancement in life. 
There is some force in Mr Dupree's submissions about the
unsatisfactory nature of the material I have about the financial means of
Miss
Wang, and her activities between the date of death and the present, but as I
have said, on the whole I am satisfied that the
picture she has given is
substantially accurate and that, at this time, she still has no significant
assets.
<P>

63	Looking at the competing claims, there is no doubt that Mr Newman's mother
had a very close relationship with him, and provided
considerable support and
assistance to him, both before and after the relationship with Miss Wang
commenced.  From the point of view
of the relationship, her claim would be a
strong one.  However, I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever as to her
financial situation,
and that makes it extremely difficult for me to make an
assessment of what the strength of her claim is.
<P>

64	So far as Mr Newman's brother is concerned, there is some evidence as to his
financial situation, which I have outlined; although
no evidence as to the
nature of the relationship with the deceased, or as to any mutual assistance or
support they may or may not
have given each other over the years. In those
circumstances, again, it is extremely difficult to come to a satisfactory view
as
to the strength of the claim.
<P>

65	I have outlined the deceased's assets at the date of death.  The effect of
the will was that the house, then considered to be
worth $180,000.00, and
furniture then considered to be worth $20,000.00 was given to Mr Newman's
mother.  Out of the remaining assets
of around $300,000.00, $100,000.00 was
given to the brother, $30,000.00 to friends, and the remaining approximately
$170,000.00 was
to be the subject of the charitable gift to which I have
referred.
<P>

66	Although this is not the question I have to decide (I have to look at the
question of adequacy at the present, not at the time
of death), as one step
towards doing that, I think it is pertinent to consider whether there was
adequate provision considered at
the date of death; and in my opinion, it is
plain that there was not.  In my opinion, adequate provision at the date of
death would
have required something like one year's accommodation and something
like one-third of the estate. 
<P>

67	As I mentioned, the situation has changed substantially since the date of
death.  The house is now said to be worth about $240,000.00,
and superannuation
turned out to be about $240,000.00.  $40,000.00 rent has been received but, as
I have already mentioned, the defendants
have paid legal costs, not just of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> proceedings but also of the possession proceedings and the
probate application, totalling $184,000.00; some $7,000.00 has been paid
in
storage fees (I am not sure whether that is included in the $184,000.00 or
not); and $1,700.00 was paid to a document examiner,
to give advice as to
whether the two letters I have referred to were genuine; and I have referred to
the additional legal costs that
are expected still to be due.
<P>

68	So far as the plaintiff's position is concerned, she received $50,000.00
from the Victim's Compensation Tribunal, but apparently
has substantially lost
that in the business venture in Western Australia. 
<P>

69	She has what appears to be a potential liability of $60,000 for legal costs
for the inquest. In relation to the incurring of
those costs, the plaintiff
gave evidence that she considered she could be a suspect.  She gave evidence
that she was questioned by
the police, that she asked the police whether she
was a suspect, and that the police replied to the effect they would just have
to
complete their investigations; and she gave evidence to the effect that the
statements presented at the inquest were not provided
to any of the
participants at the inquest until each witness was called.  There is in
evidence a piece of transcript from the inquest
in which counsel representing
Mr Newman's family sought to cross examine Miss Wang at the inquest in order to
put to her motives
that she may have had concerning the murder of Mr Newman.
In those circumstances, although it is patently clear now that she never
should
have been a suspect in anyone's mind, I cannot say it was unreasonable for her
to have wanted legal representation at the
inquest, and to have incurred costs.
I can make no comment on the amount of the costs.
<P>

70	Looking at what is now in the estate, Mr D'Ambrosio says it amounts to
$402,000.00 which includes $20,000.00 of legacies which
have apparently been
paid, $8,000.00 in costs orders owing by Miss Wang to the estate, and
$20,000.00 of furniture, the realisable
value of which I am not in a position
to find.  From this apparently would come $93,000.00 of costs, if I make a
finding in favour
of the plaintiff and order that the costs be paid out of the
estate.  This would leave something like $250,000.00 nett, if all the
costs I
have referred to are allowed as costs out of the estate.
<P>

71	Looking at the plaintiff's current needs, it seems to me that the need for
accommodation for a year or so after the death, which
now translates into a
defence to the claim for rent against her, should still be provided for.  She
has, it seems, a liability for
$60,000.00 legal costs, although I cannot
comment on whether it would be enforceable in full against her.  She needs
money for university
fees and vicissitudes.  In my opinion, in the present
circumstances, the provision for her was inadequate.
<P>

	<b><u>WHAT ORDER SHOULD BE MADE?</u></b>
<P>

72	It is plain that the intended gift to charities cannot now be met.  There is
no money which would possibly remain as a residuary
gift. 
<P>

73	As I understand the order of application of assets, if there was only
$250,000.00 in the estate, all the pecuniary legacies would
abate since they
abate prior to, as I understand it, the specific gift of the real estate.
Assuming I make an award to the plaintiff
which would come off the $250,000.00,
plainly that would eliminate all the pecuniary legacies and leave any balance
to be paid to
Mr Newman's mother as a person given a specific gift of the real
estate and furniture.  I might mention that, quite early in the
proceedings,
the executor approached the Court for authority to pay the $10,000.00 legacies
and, as I understand it, that authority
was granted in circumstances where the
result of the case appears to be that those legacies are completely wiped out.
I am not sure
where that leaves the question of entitlement to those
legacies.
<P>

74	In any event, I have to arrive at what I think is the order which ought,
having regard to the circumstances at this time, be
made for the maintenance,
education and advancement in life of the plaintiff.  Having regard to all the
circumstances I have referred
to and, in particular, the lack of evidence
concerning the strength of the competing claims which I have referred to, in my
opinion
an appropriate order is a sum of $150,000.00.
<P>

	<b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

75	On the question of costs, Mr Dupree has submitted I should order costs on
the usual trustee or indemnity basis in favour of the
executor. 
<P>

76	In my opinion it is not appropriate to do that in this case, for two
reasons.  One reason is what appears to be the disproportion
of the costs
incurred to what was involved in the case, both in terms of the size of the
estate and the issues being fought.  The
other is that it seems to me that the
case has been conducted with some animus on the part of the executor as fairly
extreme adversary
proceedings.  In those circumstances, while I am not prepared
to deprive the executor of costs, I think the order for costs should
be on a
party and party basis, so there has to be some justification given for the
amount of costs that have been incurred.
<P>

77	Particular orders are sought by the plaintiff in relation to the immediate
payment of some money out of a particular fund.  There
also may be a question
of particular orders as to how the order is to be borne by the estate.  For the
purpose of further submissions
on those matters I will refrain from making the
final order today.
<P>

78	I stand the matter over for final orders to 9.30 Friday 26th March 1999.
