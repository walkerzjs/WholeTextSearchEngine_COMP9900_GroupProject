<i>Thursday, 5 August 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3672/96	WASFY LAWINDI   -v-   MOHAMED SAFWAT ELKATEB</b>
<P>

<b>3070/98	WASFY LAWINDI   -v-   MOHAMED SAFWAT ELKATEB</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   There are presently before me two notices
of motion.  The first in point of time is the notice of motion filed in
proceedings 3672
of 1996 by the defendant to those proceedings Mohamed Safwat
Elkateb.  The other notice of motion is that filed in proceedings 3070
of 1998
by the plaintiff in those proceedings Wasfy Lawindi.  Dr Elkateb's notice of
motion was filed on 27 July 1999, Mr Lawindi's
notice of motion was filed on 5
August 1999.  Each notice of motion seeks relief concerning a caveat, being
identified as caveat
number 255633.
<P>

2   	Dr Elkateb seeks, substantively, an order that the
plaintiff withdraw that caveat, whilst the plaintiff seeks, substantively,
an
order that the operation of that caveat 'be extended indefinitely'.  At the
hearing Counsel for the plaintiff recognised that
the wording of an order
sought in those terms was somewhat inappropriate, and the hearing of the
application has proceeded upon the
basis that what the plaintiff is seeking is
an order that the operation of the caveat be extended until further order of
the Court.
<P>

3   	There is presently in force an order made by Justice
Hodgson on 10 July 1998 that the operation of the caveat be extended to
a date
being 14 days after the date of publication of an award in arbitration
proceedings between the parties.  
<P>

4   	The dispute between the parties in which the caveat and its
operation have become of relevance has a considerable history.
 That history
was referred to by Mr Justice Rolfe in the introduction to the judgment which
his Honour published on 20 July 1999.
 For the purposes of the applications
presently before me, however, it is unnecessary that I should rehearse all the
details of the
procedural history of the dispute between the parties.  It is
appropriate that I should refer to only some of those details.
<P>

5   	The defendant was the proprietor of certain land upon which
a building development was to be constructed.  A written building
contract was
signed, in which the defendant was named as the proprietor.  There is a
dispute, to which I shall shortly refer, as
to the identity of the builder in
that contract.  There have been referred to arbitration matters in dispute
between the builder
and the proprietor.   The arbitrator on 20 February 1999
after a contested hearing published an interim award.  The present defendant
then made application, pursuant to the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial
Arbitration Act </i>1984</a> challenging that interim award.  That challenge was
heard by Mr Justice Rolfe who, in the judgment published on 20 July 1999 to
which
I have already referred, ordered that the defendant's summons be
dismissed and also ordered that the summons of the plaintiff, which
was also
before his Honour, be dismissed.
<P>

6   	However, his Honour said at page 51 of his judgment that by
far the greater part of the hearing time was taken up with Dr Elkateb's
summons, and his Honour reflected that conclusion in the costs orders which his
Honour made.  
<P>

7   	The caveat which is the subject of the present applications
was lodged on 23 October 1996.  The caveator named in the caveat
is Wasfy
Lawindi, the plaintiff.  The registered proprietor named therein is Mohamed
Safwat Elkateb, the defendant.  The estate or
interest claimed is set forth in
schedule 1 to the caveat as follows:
<P>

An equitable interest pursuant to a charge created by clause 28 of the
instrument referred to below.
<P>

8   	There are in fact two instruments then referred to, one
being the building contract and the other being an order of the Court
made on
21 October 1996 in proceedings 3672 of 1996.  It would appear that the
reference to 'the instrument referred to below' is
a reference to the building
contract.  Clause 28 of the building contract is in the following terms:
<P>

The proprietor hereby charges the parcel of land on which or on part of which
the works are to be erected with the due payment to
the builder of all moneys
that may become payable to the builder by virtue of this contract or otherwise
arising from the carrying
out of the works.
<P>

9   	It is appropriate that I should deal firstly with the
application by the defendant for an order that the plaintiff withdraw
that
caveat before I deal with the application by the plaintiff for the extension of
the operation of the caveat.  It will be appreciated
that if the defendant be
successful in obtaining an order for the withdrawal of the caveat, then it will
be unnecessary for me to
consider the application of the plaintiff that the
operation of the caveat be extended until further order.
<P>

10   	The defendant has appeared before me in person upon the
hearing of the present application and has provided me with written
submissions
in support of his application.  Those submissions will be retained in the Court
file.  Essentially, those submissions
of the defendant and the present
application of the defendant for the withdrawal of the caveat are grounded upon
the provisions of
sections 4 and 10 of the <i>Building Services <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act
</i>1989</a>.
<P>

11   	Section 4 of the Act prohibits the contracting by a person
to do any residential building work unless the builder is the holder
of a
licence.  Section 10 provides that a person who enters into a contract in
contravention of section 4 is not entitled to damages
or to enforce any other
remedy in respect of a breach of the contract committed by any other party to
the contract.
<P>

12   	It has been submitted by the defendant that the builder,
the other party to the building contract, was an entity known as
Lotus
Constructions; that that entity was a partnership consisting of the plaintiff
and George Hadidi; that, although each of those
persons individually held a
builder's licence, the partnership Lotus Constructions did not hold such a
licence.  Therefore, so it
has been submitted by the defendant, there has been
a contravention of section 4 of the <i>Building Services <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act</a></i>,
the consequence of which contravention is to preclude the builder from
enforcing its right to claim what it asserts to be its monetary
entitlement
outstanding under the building contract.
<P>

13   	The question of the identity of the builder as a party to
the building contract was adverted to in the interim award published
by the
arbitrator on 20 February 1999.  Under the heading 'The Issues' the arbitrator
dealt with the question of the proper parties
to the contract.  The arbitrator
expressed his conclusion on that question as follows:
<P>

In all the above circumstances I find that the contracting parties were Lawindi
as builder and agent for Lotus Constructions, a
partnership between Lawindi and
George Hadidi.
<P>

14   	It must be appreciated that a caveat does not create or
give rise to a cause of action.  The purpose of a caveat is to act
as a
statutory bar to dealings with land under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act </i>1900</a>.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 74K</a> makes provision for the Supreme Court to extend the operation of a
caveat which has been lodged by a caveator.  Subsection (1) of
that section
contemplates the situation where a caveator is served with a lapsing notice and
then makes an application to the Supreme
Court for an order extending the
operation of the caveat.  
<P>

15   	Subsection (2) is in the following terms:
<P>

Subject to subsection (3), on the hearing of an application made under
subsection (1), the Supreme Court may, if satisfied that
the caveator's claim
has or may have substance, make an order extending the operation of the caveat
concerned for such period as
is specified in the order or until the further
order of that Court, or may make such other orders as it thinks fit, but if
that Court
is not so satisfied, it shall dismiss the application.
<P>

16   	The defendant submits that no caveatable interest is
disclosed which would justify the present caveat remaining upon the title
and
that in consequence the plaintiff should be ordered to withdraw the caveat.

<P>

17   	It is not necessary for me in the present application to
arrive at an ultimate conclusion as to whether the submissions made
by the
defendant concerning the effect of the asserted non-compliance by the plaintiff
with the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a>, and the consequences contained in section
10, of the <i>Building Services <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act</a> </i>can ultimately be
established.  I would however point to the fact that the submissions concerning
the identity of the builder which
are presently made by the defendant have
already been the subject of the decision of the arbitrator in the interim award
and of the
decision of Mr Justice Rolfe in the challenge by the defendant to
that award.
<P>

18   	It is only if I am satisfied that there is no basis
whatsoever for the claim of the plaintiff that an equitable interest arises
pursuant to the provisions of clause 28 of the building contract that I would
be justified in ordering the plaintiff to withdraw
the caveat.  
<P>

19   	I observe that in his judgment of 10 July 1998 Justice
Hodgson, in making the order which presently extends the operation
of the
caveat to a date being fourteen days after the date of the publication of an
award in the arbitration proceedings between
the parties adverted at page 4 of
his Honour's judgment, to this matter which is now relied upon by the defendant
to challenge the
entitlement of the plaintiff to maintain the caveat.  His
Honour said:
<P>

I must say also that it is not entirely clear that section 4 is breached where
two individuals each with his own builder's licence
enter into a contract
merely by reason of the fact that they happen also to be in partnership and
that there is not a builder's licence
associated with the partnership.  It
seems to me that that is another arguable question.
<P>

20   	With respect, I agree with the observations there made by
his Honour.  It follows therefore that, not being satisfied that
the caveat is
incapable of being supported, I do not propose to make the order presently
sought by the defendant for the withdrawal
of the caveat.
<P>

21   	I now turn to the application of the plaintiff.  I have
already recorded that as a consequence of the order of Justice Hodgson
of 10
July 1998 the operation of the caveat will continue to a date which will be
fourteen days after the date of the publication
of the award by the arbitrator.
There has already been published the interim award on 20 February 1999.  The
challenges to that interim
award were dismissed by Justice Rolfe on 20 July
1999.  It is, as I am informed, expected that the final award will be published
by the arbitrator in a relatively short time.  Upon the making of the final
award the caveat will remain in force for a further period
of fourteen days.
<P>

22   	What the plaintiff now seeks is that the caveat should
remain in force, not merely for a period of fourteen days after the
making of
the final award by the arbitrator, but until further order of the Court.  It
has been stated on behalf of the plaintiff
that, upon the making of the final
award, the plaintiff proposes to avail himself of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act</a> </i>by seeking the leave of the Court to
enforce the award in the same manner as a judgment or order of the Court to the
same effect and
by entering the terms of the award as a judgment of the Court.
Once that is done the cause of action which has given rise to the
arbitration
will merge in any such judgment.
<P>

23   	It has, however, been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff
that the interest in land created by clause 28 of the building
contract which
is capable of supporting the caveat will not be defeated or otherwise affected
by the merger of the contractual cause
of action in the judgment.  That
submissions seems to me to be correct.  I have already observed that the caveat
itself does not
create any cause of action, the caveat merely acts as a
statutory bar to prevent the registration of dealings which are inconsistent
with the rights of the caveator, and acts as a notice to persons searching the
title to the land of the rights claimed by the caveator.
 It would be strange
if, upon acquiring a judgment of the Court, a protection of rights arising out
of the cause of action ultimately
resulting to that judgment were to be
defeated.
<P>

24   	The question that I have to consider, however, is whether
there has been any alteration to the circumstances surrounding the
relationship
between the parties or the enforcement or protection of the rights of the
plaintiff since the orders made by Justice
Hodgson on 10 July 1998 which would
justify the Court in now extending until further order of the Court the
operation of the caveat
limited to a period of fourteen days after the making
of the final award.
<P>

25   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that
there has been such a change and alteration in the circumstances which
would
justify the making of the order now sought.  That change, so it is submitted,
is that there has been published an interim award
on 20 February 1999 which
found in favour of the plaintiff, that the challenge to that interim award
mounted by the defendant has
been unsuccessful.  It is the decision of Mr
Justice Rolfe in deciding that challenge which has brought about the present
application
made by the plaintiff.  It will be appreciated that his Honour's
judgment was published on 20 July 1999, and that the present application
of the
plaintiff was made by notice of motion filed two weeks later, on 5 August
1999.
<P>

26   	It seems to me in all the circumstances that the plaintiff
is entitled to an order extending the operation of the caveat beyond
the period
of fourteen days after the making of the final award.  The plaintiff will be
entitled to avail himself of the provisions
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration
Act</a> </i>to which I have referred, in particular <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 33</a>, for the enforcement
of the award.  It will, however, be open to the defendant, in the light of any
further change in circumstances
or in the light of the way in which the
plaintiff might go about executing upon the judgment which he proposes to enter
in the terms
of the award, to make an application for limiting the future
operation of the caveat. But it seems to me at the present time that
the
plaintiff has established an entitlement to have the operation of the caveat
continued until further order of the Court.
<P>

27   	It will be appreciated by all the parties to the present
applications that my decision concerning each of these two applications
is in
no way to be regarded as a final or binding determination between the parties
of the question which has been raised by the
defendant concerning the effect of
the asserted contravention by the plaintiff of the provisions of section 4 of
the <i>Building Services <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act</a> </i>and the consequences under section
10 of that Act.  My decision relates only to the question of whether it can be
said that there
is no possibility whatsoever that the claim of the plaintiff to
an interest in land under clause 28 of the building contract can
be
substantiated.  As Mr Justice Hodgson said in his decision, that matter is
arguable.  
<P>

28   	Accordingly, I propose to make an order of the nature
sought in the notice of motion filed by the plaintiff on 5 August 1999.
 I will
however alter the terms of the order sought in paragraph 1 of that notice of
motion.
<P>

29   	In proceedings 3672 of 1996 I make the following
orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the notice of motion filed by the defendant on 27 July 1999 be
dismissed;
<P>

2.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of that notice of
motion;
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of those
costs.
<P>

30   	In proceedings 3070 of 1998 I make the following
orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the operation of caveat number 255633 be extended until further
order of the Court;
<P>

2.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of the notice of
motion filed by the plaintiff on 5 August 1999;
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of those
costs.
