<b>3906 of 1998 	IAN DESMOND MILLAR  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			KENNETH LIVINGSTONE</b>
<P>

<b>			ESTATE OF THE LATE JILL PAMELA WARD</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> When this matter was called on before me this morning Mr
Haffenden of Counsel announced his appearance for the plaintiff and Mr Harrison
of Counsel announced his appearance for the defendant. Mr Haffenden outlined
the factual situation concerning the procedural history
of the matter. He
adverted to the fact that no appearance had been filed on behalf of the
defendant and that in consequence there
had already been made an order for
substituted service of process upon the defendant and that it would probably be
necessary for
substituted service again to be sought.
<P>

2	Mr Haffenden stated that so far as he was aware the defendant was involved in
criminal proceedings.
<P>

3	Mr Harrison, in response to a query from me, informed me that he was
instructed by Mr T Walker, solicitor, of Forestville and
that Mr Harrison did
not dispute any of the factual matters which Mr Haffenden had outlined.
<P>

4	It would appear from what I have been informed by Mr Harrison that his
instructing solicitor, Mr Walker, had first been retained
by the defendant in
October of last year. No explanation has been offered as to why Mr Harrison's
instructing solicitor has not filed
an appearance on behalf of the defendant. I
infer from what I have been informed that the failure of the solicitor to file
an appearance
on behalf of the defendant is as a result of a deliberate
decision in that regard by either the defendant himself or his solicitor
or by
both of them.
<P>

5	The omission to file an appearance does, of course, have consequences
concerning the procedural progress of the matter. Mr Harrison,
on behalf of the
defendant, sought an adjournment. Essentially, that adjournment was to enable
the defendant to comply with directions
for the filing of evidence. It would
appear, however, that the basis of the adjournment, being the unawareness of
the defendant and
his solicitors of the precise details of those procedural
directions, is due substantially, if not entirely, to the failure of the
solicitor for the defendant to file an appearance. 
<P>

6	In those circumstances I am not disposed to grant an adjournment. 
<P>

7	I understand that Mr Harrison's instructions are of a limited nature, being
only to seek an adjournment this morning. But, in
any event, I consider that,
unless an appearance is filed on behalf of the defendant or unless Mr Harrison
has instructions to give
to the Court an undertaking that such an appearance
will be filed, it is inappropriate that I should allow him to conduct the
proceedings
on behalf of the defendant. Mr Harrison does not have any
instructions concerning giving an undertaking to file an appearance on
behalf
of the defendant.
<P>

8	Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate to allow him further to conduct
the matter on behalf of the defendant. Mr Harrison
has asked that I should
allow him to be excused. I propose to do that. Thank you Mr Harrison.
<P>
