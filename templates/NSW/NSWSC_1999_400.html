<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by the plaintiff under section 74 K of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> for an order extending the operation of caveat number
564585 until further order.  That order can be made if the Court is satisfied
that the caveat has or may have substance.  The claim in the caveat is for an
equitable interest to restrain dealings which are not
consistent with
provisions of an option dated 25 January 1997 between the plaintiffs and the
defendant for the sale by the defendant
and the purchase by the plaintiffs of
the land, the subject of the caveat.
<P>

Under the option deed which is dated 25 February 1997 the defendant granted to
the plaintiffs an option to purchase the subject
property during the option
period, namely, from 7 April 1997 until 30 June 1997, in consideration of the
payment of the option fee
set out in item 4 of the schedule to the deed,
namely, $5,000.  The option was to be exercised by notice in a prescribed form
given
within the option period together with a cheque for the deposit payable
under a contract the terms of which were set out in a draft
contract annexed to
the option document.  The option deed provided in clause 11 A as follows -
(non-exercise of option to renew)
the option shall be subject to and
conditional upon the non-exercise of the right to renew contained in the lease
by 7 April 1997.
<P>

That right to renew was a right under lease registered number E 542841 as set
out in item 5 of the schedule.  Clause 4.01 of that
lease gives to the lessee a
right to take a further lease for a term of five years from the expiration of
the term of the original
lease.  That would mean if the option were exercised a
new lease from 1 July 1997 for a term of five years.  The notice of exercise
of
the right of renewal was required to be given not less than three months and
not more than six months before the expiration of
the term.  In other words it
could not be given earlier than 1 January 1997 nor later than 31 March 1997.
Why clause 11 of the option
had a date of 7 April 1997 is not clear.
<P>

By letter dated 21 March 1997 the solicitors for the defendant gave to the
solicitors for the plaintiffs notice that the lessee
had exercised his option
to take a further term and stated that in those circumstances the option was of
no effect.  They sent back
the $5,000.  That letter was written after a letter
had been sent on the letterhead of Alphega Medical Practice ACN 060527442
signed
by Nichole Bateman stated to be a director presumably of that company
giving notice of exercise of the right to renew the lease.
<P>

Matters then stood between the parties on the basis that the option was no
longer of any effect.  Later, however, the plaintiffs
appear to have become
aware of certain things which led them to believe that the option for a new
lease had not been exercised. 
In fact, there is now registered on the title a
lease for five years from 1 July 1998 to Tricon Austin Pty Ltd.
<P>

The plaintiffs also became aware of a statutory declaration of Mr Barry Milch,
solicitor, made on 2 July 1998 as solicitor for the
defendant under which he
states that Alphega Management Services Pty Ltd, the lessee under the relevant
lease referred to in the
option document has not exercised the option for
renewal and vacated the property on 13 June 1998.  It is obvious enough that
declaration
was made for the purpose of obtaining registration of the lease
which is presently entered on the title.  
<P>

Having become aware of those circumstances, the plaintiffs claim that as they
had been wrongly informed the option had been exercised,
that amounted to, at
the least, misleading information therefore their rights under the option had
not become nugatory.  They then
purported to exercise the option.
<P>

They have stated through their solicitor that they intend to bring proceedings
in this Court for relief against forfeiture of their
rights as grantees of the
option.  The question then is whether or not there is a serious issue to be
tried on whether or not there
is an extant interest in the subject land which
would justify the Court in continuing the caveat in force.
<P>

There are two matters which support the claim of the plaintiff, although the
first may be rather weak.  The letter of 18 March 1997
if it purports to be an
exercise of option by the company, the ACN number of which is set out at the
top of the letter, is not an
exercise of option by the lessee company which has
a different ACN number.  Secondly, the declaration of Mr Milch states that the
option for renewal was not exercised.  While counsel for the defendant says
that the letter of 18 March 1997 was an exercise by the
lessee of the right of
renewal under clause 0.41 of the lease and it doesn't matter what happened
thereafter, that may be the position
as if it were an exercise by the lessee of
its right to a further lease, but if it were not an exercise of that right as
the solicitor
for the lessor defendant says it was not, then it is not possible
to rely on that letter of 18 March 1997 as being a valid exercise
of the right
to take a renewed lease.  On any basis it cannot be said there was not a
serious question to be tried on that issue.
<P>

The next question is whether, assuming that was right, the plaintiffs may be
able to maintain their claim for relief against forfeiture
based on some
improper conduct of the defendant company.  That would, in the long run, depend
upon what evidence is given as to the
letter of 18 March, its validity and its
effect, and the conduct of the lessor in respect of that letter.  There doesn't
appear to
be any decision which has established that a right to relief against
forfeiture will arise or that relief would be given in a case
 such as this,
but one cannot say that such a claim would fail.
<P>

In the circumstances, as there has been nothing put forward by the defendant to
show that the balance of convenience is otherwise,
it seems to me that it is
proper to extend the caveat on terms that the plaintiffs bring the action which
is foreshadowed by them
within 21 days of this date.  There is, in my view no
reason why that claim cannot be made in the proceedings.
<P>

<b>Orders and directions</b>
<P>

Upon the plaintiffs, through their counsel giving the usual undertaking as to
damages, I make the orders as sought in para 2 of
the summons.  
<P>

I direct the plaintiff to file and serve within 21 days a statement of claim
substantially in accordance with the draft document
annexed to the affidavit of
Mr T S McCabe sworn 27 April 1999.  
<P>

I direct if such statement of claim is not so filed, the defendant may apply to
me on 24 hours notice for an order that the caveat
be removed.  
<P>

I order the costs of the proceedings to date be costs in the action. 
<P>

I further order that exhibit A be returned to the plaintiff's solicitor to
enable him to comply with the undertaking given to the
Court.  
<P>

Order other exhibits be returned to the plaintiff's solicitor to be brought
back to court for the hearing.
