<b>1973/97	GLENN WOODS &amp; ANOR v DESRE CLAIR WOODS &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1	These proceedings arise from 2 payments, of $17,000 and $11,500 respectively,
which Desre Clair Woods, the first defendant ("Desre"),
says she made to her
son Glenn Woods, the first plaintiff ("Glenn"). He admits that he received the
first, but says that it was a
gift, not a loan as she alleges.  He denies that
he received the second payment at all.  The second plaintiff is his wife Marcia
Woods ("Marcia").  The second and third defendants are Richard Lee Woods
("Richard"), who is Desre's other son, and Amanda Jane Woods
("Amanda"),
Richard's wife.  The facts of the matter are as follows.
<P>

2	In 1982 Desre lived in a house at 2 Catriona Court, Normanhurst, which she
owned subject to a small mortgage.  In April of that
year a Mr and Mrs Harwin
("the Harwins") lent money for use by Glenn in a business he was conducting,
which was then in difficulties
and which subsequently failed.  It was alleged
by the Harwins that the money was lent to Desre and then relent to Glenn, but
by Desre
and Glenn that it was lent by the Harwins to Glenn direct.  Dispute as
to who was the borrower was resolved by an arbitrator in the
District Court,
then by a Judge of that Court, and subsequently by the Court of Appeal, in
favour of the Harwins.
<P>

3	During 1982 Glenn married Marcia, who is by origin a Singaporean Chinese.  At
various times between 1982 and February 1994 Glenn
and Marcia lived with Desre
in her residence, although not continuously.  In some ways it is surprising
that this was retried on
many occasions, since it is quite plain from the
evidence that, to say the least, Desre and Marcia did not get on from the
start.
 It is clear on the evidence that as early as 1983 Marcia was taken to
Hornsby Hospital and kept there overnight after an incident
near Wahroonga
railway station in which she became hysterical in Desre's presence, apparently
at the prospect of returning to the
same house as Desre.
<P>

4	In June 1984 Desre sold her house at 2 Catriona Court, Normanhurst and
purchased a house at 18 Yakaloo Crescent, Forresters Beach
("Yakaloo
Crescent").  She paid out the small mortgage over the Normanhurst house, bought
Yakaloo Crescent without borrowing money
and had about $10,000 in cash left
over.
<P>

5	In June 1987 the Harwins sued Desre in the District Court at Sydney for money
lent.  The claim was heard before an arbitrator
in July 1991 and he on 17 July
1991 made an award in favour of the Harwins for some $58,000.  In 1992 those
proceedings were reheard
in the District Court before his Honour Judge
McLachlan, who on 22 October 1992 again found a verdict for the Harwins.  By
this stage
Glenn and Marcia had bought a block of land at 224 Cresthaven
Avenue, Bateau Bay and were proceeding to build a house on it.  At
the time,
Richard was in financial difficulties.  Desre borrowed $65,000 against Yakaloo
Crescent and advanced $30,000 to Richard.
 On 2 December 1992 she paid $17,000
to Glenn.  
<P>

6	The facts thus far stated are not seriously in controversy, but there is
conflict about what follows.
<P>

7	Desre's evidence is that in about November 1992 Glenn approached her and told
her that he and Marcia were in trouble with their
home at Cresthaven Avenue;
they had gone way over budget; and the State Bank was not prepared to increase
their approved limit to
pay the final progress payment to the builder.  He
asked his mother whether she would arrange a loan for about $30,000 on her
house
for a year; and he said that he would pay the costs and repay the loan in
6-12 months from his business which was improving.  She
then went with him to
see a finance consultant at Long Jetty and on that day Glenn asked her to come
to the State Bank in Long Jetty
"and give the Bank an undertaking that you are
arranging to finance your house and will loan[sic] Marcia and me $17,000 from
the
proceeds otherwise they will not pay the last progress payment."  He said
that he would not need the loan for very long.  Desre says
that subsequently
she went to State Bank at Long Jetty and met a woman who she thought was the
accountant and signed "some documents
giving some form of guarantee or
undertaking on behalf of Glenn and Marcia ... relating to their property at
Cresthaven Avenue".
 It is clear from all the evidence that the borrowing that
was in fact obtained by Desre at this time was not in fact $30,000, but
$65,000
(not obtained through the finance consultant at Long Jetty), of which $30,000
was paid to Richard, undoubtedly as a loan,
and $17,000 was paid to Glenn.
Desre says that it was as a loan on the basis set out above that she paid
$17,000 to Glenn on 2 December
1992.
<P>

8	Glenn's version of the conversation leading to the payment is that Desre said
that she had to find $30,000 for Richard or the
ANZ Bank would send him
bankrupt; that Richard said that she could borrow $65,000 on the security of
her house; "the more I borrow
on the house the less I have to worry about the
Harwins"; "if you will go guarantor for the loan I will give you $17,000 out of
the
proceeds".  Glenn says that he replied that he would like to help her "and
an extra $17,000.00 would be handy for some things Marcia
and I want for the
house."  It is Glenn and Marcia's case that the word "give" was to be
understood literally as a word of gift,
and that upon payment of the $17,000
the gift of that sum was complete.
<P>

9	It seems clear that the document signed by Desre at the Bank was a statutory
declaration which bears date 11 November 1992.  The
body of it states:
<P>

"I am providing my son Glenn Christopher Woods with the sum of ($15,000)
fifteen thousand dollars which is not repayable and there
are no conditions
what so ever pertainable[sic] to this gift."
<P>

10	It is Richard's evidence that in December 1992 in a conversation with Glenn
he asked for an assurance that Glenn would in respect
of the mortgage on
Desre's house pay half the interest payments as he had agreed.  He says that
Glenn replied:
<P>

"I don't think it's entirely fair that I pay half; Mum's only loaning[sic] me
$15,000.00 and your[sic] getting $30,000.  You should
pay a higher share."
<P>

Glenn did not demur at the use of the word "loan" by Richard or otherwise to
the request for an assurance, except as to the quantum
of his share of the
interest.  I accept Richard's evidence about this conversation.
<P>

11	Further undoubted facts are that in October 1993 Desre sold Yakaloo
Crescent.  Out of the proceeds she repaid the loan of $65,000
previously
mentioned; she paid money into Court as security for the judgment in the case
brought by the Harwins, the appeal in which
was then pending; and after meeting
legal bills she had about $15,000 left over.  At the same time she moved into
Glenn and Marcia's
house at 224 Cresthaven Avenue, Bateau Bay.  As might have
been expected from the earlier history, things did not go well in the
household.  On 31 January 1994 Glenn and Marcia completed the purchase of a
house property at 24 Waite Street, Bateau Bay, and shortly
afterwards Desre
moved in and is still living there.  However, the basis on which she moved in
and whether or not at about the time
of the purchase of this house she paid to
Glenn $11,500 are hotly contested, as set out below.
<P>

12	Desre says that in November 1993 she had a conversation with Glenn
indicating that she could no longer put up with the domestic
situation and that
she was also under stress because of the court case with the Harwins.  She said
that this had cost her her home,
her car and her security and that she held him
totally responsible.  He said that they should look around for another house
for her;
she said that, as she had only $12,000 left, that was impossible.  The
conversation then continued:
<P>

"Glenn Woods:
<P>

`Well if you put in the $12,000 for a deposit, I think I can arrange for a
mortgage with my bank.  My business is going quite well
now, but I don't have
much cash at the moment.'
<P>

DW:
<P>

`What security would I have in the house.  You know Marcia and I don't get
on.'
<P>

Glenn Woods:
<P>

`Don't worry about that.  We'll buy the house using your money for the deposit,
I'll pay the mortgage and it can be a sort of long
term investment for Marcia
and I.  You can live in it as long as you live and when your [sic] no longer
around we can sell it or
rent it.  Marcia will be quite happy with that
arrangement as we lived with you for nine years.'"
<P>

She said that in late November a further conversation took place as follows:
<P>

"Glenn Woods:
<P>

`Mum, I have made finance arrangements with my bank to purchase the Waite
Street property and they have agreed provided I can evidence
the deposit from
my company.  I have made arrangements with Marcia's brother in Singapore to
give him the money you are providing
in case and then he is going to loan it to
my company G.C. Industries.  This will satisfy the bank and keep your name out
of the
transaction in case the Harwin's[sic] bring any further actions against
you.'
<P>

DW:
<P>

`Why do you have to give my money to Marcia's brother so he can loan it to
you.'
<P>

Glenn Woods:
<P>

`It's just the way I've structured the deal and what I have represented to the
bank.'"
<P>

13	The evidence originally given in her affidavit as to her providing Glenn
with the money was that she obtained a cash sum from
her cheque account of
$9,700 on 21 October 1993 and that early in December 1993 she handed Glenn
$11,500 in cash.  She deposed that
at that time Marcia was present as well as
Glenn and the following conversation took place:
<P>

"DW:
<P>

`Glenn, I want you to document my interest in this property as this is the last
remaining amount of money I own.'
<P>

Glenn Woods:
<P>

`Of course we can have something drawn up, but it will have to wait until I
return from overseas.'
<P>

Marcia Woods:
<P>

`Des, Glenn and I are buying this house as a long term investment.  We are
quite happy for you to live in it for as long as you
live.  After all its the
least we can do after you losing your house and us living with you for all
those years.'"
<P>

14	She deposed that on a number of occasions after moving into 24 Waite Street
she asked Glenn for a piece of paper evidencing her
"investment" and "life
tenancy arrangement", to which he would reply that he would do it later, he
didn't have time.  On 21 November
1994 he was about to go overseas.  She
deposed that she then had a conversation with him as follows
<P>

"DW:
<P>

`Glenn despite repeated requests you and Marcia have not documented my interest
in the Waite Street property or your indebtedness
to me.  You are about to
leave for overseas again.  What would happen to me if God forbid you were
killed in a plane crash or something?'
<P>

Glenn Woods:
<P>

`Alright [sic], Mum I don't have time to go to the solicitor, but I will write
you out a letter to cover you now until I get back
and then we can get it done
properly when I return.'"
<P>

He then undoubtedly wrote a note, which is in evidence.  The text, which is of
some importance, is as follows:
<P>

"In the event of my death I wish my mother to be secure in both the home at 24
Waite Street, Bateau Bay and the motor car Daihatsu
Charade due to the fact
that I owe her money that was loaned [sic] to me through 18 Yakaloo Cres.
Forresters Beach.
<P>

The house at 24 Waite Street, Bateau Bay is not to be sold and my mother to
remain in that house."
<P>

15	Glenn's version of these events is as follows.  He denies that he ever
received $11,500 from his mother; that his mother paid
any money towards the
purchase of the Waite Street property; and that his mother was ever promised
any right to live in the Waite
Street property.  As to the conversation in
November 1994 and the note which is undoubtedly in his handwriting, he said
that prior
to November 1994 Desre had been pressuring him about what would
happen with Waite Street if he died, saying, "I don't trust Marcia.
 Where do I
live if anything happens to you?" and asking him to make provision for her in
his will.  In his original affidavit he
simply acknowledges that he signed the
document "to provide comfort to her if anything happened whilst I was
overseas."  His further
versions as to the creation of that document will be
adverted to below.  Marcia denies her presence at any conversation in late
1993.
 Glenn says that the money for the deposit was provided from $14,000 lent
to him by his brother-in-law who was at that time a lawyer
in Singapore.  His
evidence concerning the circumstances of that borrowing will also be referred
to below.
<P>

16	In fact, Desre was left in undisputed possession of the Waite Street
property for some time.  Hostilities broke out when Richard
and Amanda became
homeless and Desre took them into the house.  Incidentally, she also allowed
them to drive a car provided for her
by Glenn.  Their presence was bitterly
resented by Glenn and Marcia.
<P>

<b>The proceedings</b>
<P>

17	Glenn and Marcia have brought these proceedings for possession of 24 Waite
Street.  Desre has brought cross claims arising out
of the 2 payments of
$17,000 and $11,500 discussed above.  The issues, as agreed between the
parties, in relation to which the trial
was conducted were as follows:
<P>

1	The plaintiffs' claim for possession.
<P>

2	The first defendant's claim to have an interest in the Waite Street property
as an equitable licencee for life.
<P>

3	The first defendant's claim to have an interest in the Waite Street property
as the beneficiary of a resulting trust in the proportions
11.5/155 (7.24%).
<P>

4	The effect of Marcia's lack of consent on any order granting Desre an
interest in the Waite Street property.
<P>

5	The right otherwise of the first defendant to reside in the Waite Street
property.
<P>

6	The claim by the first defendant for repayment of the sum of $17,000 being on
Desre's case a loan and on Glenn and Marcia's case
a gift.
<P>

<b>Credit of witnesses</b>
<P>

18	A great deal in this case turns on the credit of witnesses.  The principal
witnesses were Desre, Glenn and Marcia.  Oral evidence
was also given by
Richard and Amanda.
<P>

19	<b>Desre.</b>  Desre's evidence was not without its difficulties.  These, it
seemed to me, arose largely through defects of memory.  Overall, I
formed the
view that she was attempting to tell the Court the truth.
<P>

20	<b>Glenn.  </b>Glenn was a most unsatisfactory witness.  His credit was
heavily attacked by Mr Radojev, of counsel for Desre, and with considerable
success.  He was to my mind demonstrated to be untruthful in a number of
important pieces of evidence.  First, he claimed that he
had gone to Singapore
to borrow the sum of $14,000 from Mr Tan and that it was paid to him in cash in
Singapore.  Subsequently, he
said that it was paid to him in cash, not in
Singapore but outside the customs area in the terminal at Subang Airport at
Kuala Lumpur,
where it was handed to him and he counted it in the presence of
Mr Tan.  Then and there, an agreement concerning the loan was signed
by him,
his signature being witnessed by Mr Tan's wife, who had either gone from
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur especially for this purpose,
or coincidentally
happened to be there.  Even when the story as to the place of handover changed,
he continued to insist that he
had been to Singapore during the course of that
business trip.  He maintained that story until his passport was produced on
subpoena,
and was found to lack any evidence of a relevant entry into
Singapore.  He then said that on that trip he had not gone to Singapore,
but
had gone to Johor Baru, which is at the Malaysian end of the causeway from
Singapore to Malaysia..  He agreed that he at all
times knew that Johor Baru
was not in Singapore, but in Malaysia.  When asked why he had said he had gone
to Singapore, he said that
he had said it because Johor Baru is virtually on
the border.  However, it was not there, but in Kuala Lumpur, that Mr Tan had
handed
him the money.  Both the content of that evidence and the manner of his
giving it were most unimpressive and reflect most seriously
upon his credit,
particularly in matters pertaining to the subject dealings with his mother and
the circumstances surrounding them.
 Even more centrally, his evidence about
the circumstances of the production of the note he gave his mother was most
unsatisfactory.
 He admitted that it was all in his handwriting.  At one time,
he claimed that his mother had dictated to him the second paragraph,
but said
that he had written out the first half as his own composition.  Upon being
squarely faced with the difficulty of the use
of the word "loan" in the first
half, he gave other versions, including that his mother was the author of the
entire note, which
she had written out beforehand, brought to the meeting and
handed to him, and which he copied.  He is a businessman who has been
engaged
in various businesses, and is now engaged in international trade with various
Asian countries.  He does not claim not to
understand the word "loan".  He was
quite unable to give any explanation as to why he used the word, though he
claimed not to mean
it, in the context of a document, the purpose of which
according to him was that it was to be used after his death by Desre to attempt
to persuade Marcia to let her continue to reside in the house.  I am not
prepared to accept anything he says about his dealings with
his mother and
associated subjects unless it is corroborated by credible evidence or is
against interest.
<P>

21	<b>Marcia.  </b>Marcia was also an unimpressive witness.  Her credit, too,
was challenged with cosiderable success.  Whilst acknowledging bad relations
between herself and Desre, she denied any abuse, physical or verbal, towards
Desre (except for an exchange of the epithet "bitch").
 She also denied the use
of bad language towards Richard and Amanda.  She particularly denied that she
had used the word "arsehole"
to or of any member of the family, or that she had
returned baby clothes sent to her on the occasion of the birth of one of her
children
by Richard and Amanda with an abusive note describing them as
"arseholes".  She denied it was her handwriting in the note, when produced.
 It
was, however, established to my satisfaction that her denials concerning
Richard and Amanda, the abusive note and the use of
"arseholes" as an insult
were not true.  Neither do I accept her general denials of abuse of Desre.
Marcia was a witness of little
credit.
<P>

22	<b>Richard and Amanda.  </b>The ambit of their evidence was smaller.  I was
impressed by the way that Richard gave evidence concerning these events which
occurred
in an emotional and upsetting atmosphere.  I formed the view that they
were both attempting to tell the Court the truth and in general
succeeding in
relation to the matters to which they deposed.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>:  <b>The Loan Transaction</b>
<P>

23	In the event I accept that Desre's account of the circumstances in which the
$17,000 was paid to Glenn was substantially as set
out in her evidence
summarised in [7].  I prefer her evidence concerning those events to that of
Glenn.  I am far from certain that,
even if I accepted his version of what he
said as set out in [8], it would be appropriate to construe the use of the word
"gift"
in that context as amounting to the verbal element necessary to
constitute a gift.  In any event, I simply do not accept his version
of the
conversation.  Apart from anything else, it seems to me that the transaction
deposed to by Desre is inherently probable and
that deposed to by Glenn is
inherently improbable.  Why would a mother, whose son on his own evidence has
effected her financial
ruin, and who is now left with very little money, borrow
money for a term of 12 months only against an unencumbered house which is
virtually her only asset, and simply give it to him?  Her version, that she was
prepared,whilst helping Richard at the time by borrowing
money to lend to him,
to borrow an additional sum (rather generously one might think in the
circumstances) to afford a short term
loan to Glenn, is much more probable.  I
find that the transaction took place substantially as she deposed.  She has
demanded the
repayment of the money and is entitled to judgment in the sum of
$17,000 together with interest on that sum under &#167;94 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act 1970</a> from the date of demand until judgment.  I do not think there is clear
evidence that the loan was made to Marcia as well as Glenn.
 Though it was said
to be advanced for use as a progress payment on the house at Cresthaven Avenue,
Bateau Bay, there is no evidence
of participation by Marcia in the relevant
conversations.  The simultaneous loan to Richard appears to have been made to
him alone,
and it seems more probable that the loan was asked for by Glenn and
made by Desre to him alone.  In all the circumstances the judgment
will be
entered against him alone.
<P>

24	The only piece of evidence that gives any support to Glenn's version is the
statement in the statutory declaration made by Desre
on 11 November 1992 at the
State Bank suggesting that the payment was a gift.  It seems that a document
was required in these terms
by the Bank, which would not give Glenn further
accommodation unless he demonstrated that he was injecting further funds of his
own
into the property:  a loan from someone else would not do; a gift from his
mother would.  Whether or not Desre was fully aware of
the significance of the
statutory declaration and despite the fact that it is in her handwriting, in my
opinion the transaction was
in truth as I have found.
<P>

<b>Conclusion:  Waite Street</b>
<P>

25	Again, on the balance of probabilities, I accept Desre's version of what was
said and done in relation to the $11,500 and the
purchase of the Waite Street
property.  I accept that she had a conversation with Glenn and Marcia as set
out in [13].  It is submitted
that it is inconceivable that Marcia would have
agreed to any transaction or any such transaction with Desre.  However, a
transaction
in this form solved Marcia's problem and was for her benefit.  The
problem solved was that it provided somewhere for Desre to live
which meant
that there would be no question of Desre and her living under the same roof.
At the same time it provided a beneficial
opportunity with the use of someone
else's money to acquire an asset which would be of value to her in the long
run.  I am not entirely
clear as to whether or not Glenn obtained $14,000 from
Mr Tan at about the same time or for what purpose.  As I have already said,
his
evidence about this matter was utterly unsatisfactory and I do not accept it.
The situation is rendered all the more curious
because Mr Tan and his wife did
not give evidence, although it is clear that they were in Sydney at the time of
the trial and no
convincing reason was given for their non-production as
witnesses.  It was said both by Glenn and Marcia that they were now so
estranged
from Mr Tan and his wife that the Tans would not come.  However, no
subpoena was served on them.  And the fact of their estrangement
depends upon
the word of Glenn and Marcia, which I am not prepared to accept in this regard.
Furthermore, it is odd, if there is
such a degree of estrangement as is
claimed, that there has been no demand by Mr Tan for the repayment of his loan
of $14,000.  Yet
the evidence is that there has been none.  It was further
submitted that it is inherently unlikely that a son would promise to allow
his
mother to live in a house bought by him and his wife with borrowed money and
promise to pay the mortgage payments, because the
house could not then be let
to defray those payments.  In some circumstances that may seem unlikely, but
where the son has caused
the mother such financial haarm as in this case, but
subsequently has a successful business, it does not seem particularly unlikely
to me.
<P>

26	Desre's evidence, once accepted, establishes that there was a contract that
in consideration of her contributing $11,500 to the
purchase of the Waite
Street property she would be permitted to live in that property for life and
that Glenn and Marcia would continue
to pay the mortgage payments in respect of
it.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s54a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 54A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> was not pleaded as a defence to
the claim on that contract.  Mr O'Loughlin, of counsel for Glenn and Marcia,
has properly informed
the Court that that was not by reason of an accidental
omission but of a considered decision.  No doubt it was taken by reason of
the
potentially available replies, but that is of no moment; the defence is simply
not pleaded.
<P>

27	In these circumstances, there is no doubt that Desre is entitled to a
declaration of the subsistence of such a contract.  However,
there has not been
full argument as to whether she should have an order for specific performance.
Objection has been taken that the
requirement of supervision by the Court of
future mortgage instalments ought preclude such an order; and there really has
been no
argument on the relationship between the specific enforceability of the
contract and the plaintiffs' entitlement or otherwise to
an order for
possession.  I shall stand the matter over for directions as to the further
hearing of the matter on those issues of
relief; short minutes can be brought
in on that occasion if the defendant desires immediate final orders on the loan
claim or for
declaratory relief concerning the contract.
