<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Monday, 29 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2015/95	DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION   -v-   FRITWELL PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER: </b>There is presently before me a Notice of
Motion filed by the plaintiff, the Deputy Commission of Taxation, on 17
February 1999.  By
that Notice of Motion the plaintiff seeks, substantively, an
order that the Notice of Motion filed by Hugh Jenner Wily, as liquidator
of the
defendant, Fritwell Pty Limited, filed on 31 July 1995, be struck out for want
of prosecution.
<P>

2   	That Notice of Motion filed on 31 July 1995 sought,
substantively, a declaration that a payment which had been made by the
defendant on 16 March 1995, in the sum of $64,942.03 to the Deputy Commissioner
of Taxation, was an unfair preference within the
meaning of section 588F(a) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>, and consequential orders that the Deputy
Commission of Taxation pay that sum to the liquidator and also pay interest
upon that sum.
 
<P>

3   	It would appear that proceedings for the winding up of the
defendant were instituted in February 1995.  Those proceedings sought
payment
by the defendant to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation of the sum of
$64,942.03.  Upon payment of that amount by the defendant,
the proceedings were
dismissed on 16 March 1995.  
<P>

4   	However, subsequently, the defendant was wound up by order
of the court in the present proceedings in 2015 of 1995.  Mr Hugh
Jenner Wily
was appointed the liquidator of the defendant.  Subsequently he, upon his
retirement, has been succeeded in that role
by the present liquidator of the
defendant, Mr Andrew Hugh Jenner Wily.  The liquidator seeks to have repaid to
him the amount which
in March 1995 was paid by the defendant to the present
plaintiff, upon the ground that that payment constitutes a preference which
advantages the plaintiff to the detriment of other creditors of the
defendant.
<P>

5   	It is not necessary for me to rehearse the procedural
history of the matter since the liquidator filed the Notice of Motion
to which
I have already referred on 31 July 1995 seeking relief in relation to that
payment.  Suffice it to say, however, that on
20 June 1996 the proceedings,
being in essence the Notice of Motion filed on 31 July 1995, were stood over
generally.  The liquidator
has made no attempt since that time to advance the
proceedings which are before the Court.  It would appear, however, that the
liquidator
has conducted certain negotiations directly with the Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation, rather than (as would have been more appropriate)
through the solicitors for the liquidator and with the Australian Government
solicitor, which is acting for the plaintiff in the
present proceedings. 
<P>

6   	For instance, as recently as 3 February 1999, the
liquidator has seen fit to address to the Australian Taxation Office a demand
for repayment of the moneys which are the subject of the present claim,
together with interest thereon, and in making that demand,
to rely upon a
somewhat curious letter which the Moneys Insolvency Unit of the Australian
Taxation Office sent to the liquidator
on 1 June 1995 (which would give the
impression of constituting an admission of the liability of the plaintiff to
repay the amount
claimed as constituting "a voidable transaction as an unfair
preference").
<P>

7   	Indeed, even after the present application had been
foreshadowed, the liquidator again wrote on 17 February 1999 (the date
on which
the Notice of Motion presently before the Court was in fact filed), seeking
payment of the amount which is the subject of
the present proceedings.  It is
entirely inappropriate in my view that, where there are contentious proceedings
on foot between parties,
each of whom is represented by legal representatives,
one of those parties should claim payment of the moneys which are the subject
of the proceedings by what is in effect a demand addressed directly to the
other party, without acknowledging the existence of the
proceedings and without
acknowledging the fact that each of the parties is represented by its or his
respective solicitor.  
<P>

8   	The principles relating to the dismissal of proceedings for
want of prosecution are well known.  It is unnecessary for me here
to repeat
those principles.  There is little merit in the situation in which the
defendant finds himself.  Mr Chippendall, of Counsel
for the defendant, has
however submitted that in applying the various principles on which the Court
should exercise its discretion
in an application to dismiss for want of
prosecution, the Court should ultimately exercise its discretion against such
dismissal.
 He has pointed to the fact that the relevant limitation period
pursuant to the provisions of section 588SE of the <i>Corporations Law </i>may
now have expired.  He has pointed to what he has described as the acquiescence
by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in the progress
of the negotiations, and
he has queried whether there is any prejudice to the plaintiff which would be
greater than the prejudice
to the defendant if the proceedings were now to be
dismissed.
<P>

9   	On behalf of the plaintiff it has however been submitted
that, consequent upon the delay by the defendant, a delay which it
should be
emphasised has not been in any way satisfactorily explained, there has been
some prejudice to the plaintiff because of
the fact that at least one the
solicitors who was formerly handling the matter in the office of the Australian
Government solicitor
is no longer employed by that entity, and the fact that at
least one of the officers who had been handling the matter in the office
of the
plaintiff, being the officer responsible for the matter in June 1995, not only
is no longer employed by the plaintiff but
as I have been informed, is no
longer living in Australia.  
<P>

10   	I appreciate that there is some prejudice to the plaintiff
if the proceedings are allowed to remain on foot. It will however
be understood
that it was always open to the plaintiff at any time after 20 June 1996 to make
an application to have the defendant's
present claim dismissed for want of
prosecution.   
<P>

11   	I have arrived at the conclusion that, on balance, it is
not appropriate that I should at this stage dismiss for want of prosecution
the
present application of the defendant for relief of the nature sought in its
Notice of Motion filed on 31 July 1995.  It seems
to me appropriate however
that I should make directions in the matter which will ensure that there is no
further delay in having
that application brought on for hearing.  
<P>

12   	In addition, it seems to me that the plaintiff was fully
justified in making the present application, and I propose to make
an order for
costs in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

13   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the defendant file and serve any further affidavits upon which
it may wish to rely on or before Tuesday 27 April
1999.
<P>

2.	I stand the matter over to Thursday 29 April 1999 before the Registrar.
<P>

3.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of the Notice of
Motion filed by the plaintiff on 17 February 1999.
<P>

4.	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
