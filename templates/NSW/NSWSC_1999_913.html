<P>

<b>Remarks on Sentence</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner, William Peter Victorsen,
appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty to the murder of his
father.
In the early hours of Sunday, 2 November 1997 he beat his father to death with
a heavy metal pipe at their home at Eastwood.
 To understand the circumstances
of the killing, it is necessary to sketch the prisoner's background and, in
particular, his relationship
with his father.
<P>

<b>The background</b>
<P>

2    	Evidence of his background emanated mainly from his
own testimony in this Court and the history he provided to Dr William
Lucas,
psychiatrist, who provided a report.  His account was corroborated in
significant respects by his married sister, Mrs Simone
Ibrahim, whom I found to
be an impressive witness.
<P>

3    	The prisoner is a single man, who is now twenty-six
years old and was twenty-four at the time of the offence.  He was born
and
raised in Sydney, for the most part in the family home at Eastwood.  His only
sibling is his sister, who is younger than he.
 He was very close to his mother
but not to his father, whom he found distant and demanding.  Mrs Ibrahim
herself said that, while
she loved her father, he was "very unemotional" and "a
very hard man to talk to...".  It does appear that the prisoner's relationship
with his father was submissive and lacking in affection, and that this lowered
his self-esteem.
<P>

4    	Dr Lucas described him as "somewhat of a loner".  He
progressed satisfactorily at school, completing his Higher School Certificate,
but had very few friends among his peers.  He enrolled in Arts at Macquarie
University and studied for two years.  However, he left
university at the end
of 1992 and did not finish the course.  This does not appear to have been the
result of any lack of ability
on his part.  He presented in the witness box as
an intelligent and articulate young man.
<P>

5    	His father had been successful in small business,
among other things, as the proprietor of a milk run.  He purchased a milk
run
for the prisoner, who worked it through his years at university and for a
little over a year thereafter.  During the same period
after leaving
university, he also worked as a clerical assistant for a telecommunications
company.
<P>

6    	In 1994 he began trading in futures, moving into
rented premises in the city which he shared with other young men engaged
in the
same activity.  Futures trading was stressful and involved long hours.  He
already smoked marijuana daily, and he began to
use cocaine with the same
frequency and, to a lesser extent, ecstasy.  This was the beginning of a
pattern of drug abuse which was
to escalate such that, as Dr Lucas put it, "his
drug abuse almost completely took over his life."
<P>

7    	In about April 1995 his mother told him that she was
terminally ill with cancer.  He was devastated by this news and gave
up work as
a futures trader.  During the course of that trade he had made and lost a
considerable amount of money, and not long before
he abandoned it his father
was called upon to meet his commitments to the tune of about $100,000.  He
began abusing prescription
drugs of the benzodiazepine type: primarily Rohypnol
and, later, Valium.  He continued to smoke marijuana.  He also drank alcohol,
not through dependence upon that drug but because it enhanced the effect of the
benzodiazepines.
<P>

8    	To Dr Lucas he described himself as "a complete mess"
after his mother died in November 1995.  Certainly, this was his sister's
observation.  He had moved back to the family home during his mother's illness,
and he remained living there with his father for
most of the time thereafter.
His drug abuse worsened.  As his tolerance for benzodiazepines increased, he
was taking very large quantities
of prescription drugs daily.  In relation to
his drug use by 1997, he said in evidence, "It fluctuated depending on how much
I could
procure.  I could never get enough."
<P>

9    	His use of benzodiazepines and marijuana led to
paranoid thoughts.  He would believe that people were following him or that
someone was in the house, apparently bent upon doing him harm.  His sister
observed him to exhibit irrational fears and sometimes
to speak in what she
described as "gibberish language", and this behaviour scared her.  From his
perceived need for protection he
kept three pieces of metal pipe, two in the
house and one in the laundry.  It was the pipe in the laundry that was to
become the
murder weapon.  Dr Lucas saw this behaviour as consistent with his
drug abuse and did not consider it to be evidence of a psychosis.

<P>

10    	As is so often the case, he resorted to deception to
feed his addiction.  He paid friends to obtain drugs on his behalf,
and became
skilled at "doctor shopping" and stealing prescriptions.  Earlier, before he
was earning money as a futures trader, he
had sometimes stolen cash from his
father.  From time to time, he extracted money from his father, as he had
earlier from his mother,
by falsely representing that he was indebted to drug
dealers.  Indeed, only a matter of days before the killing he smashed several
windows at the home and sprayed the words "warning/death" on the exterior to
suggest that his debts were such that dealers were prepared
to kill him.  His
father gave him money on that occasion, although considerably less than he had
asked for. 
<P>

11    	In July 1997 he stole some cheques from his father
and negotiated them, obtaining more than $13,000.  His father reported
the
matter to police, possibly in the hope that his being charged might break the
cycle of drug abuse.  Certainly, it appeared to
the prisoner that his father
wanted to help him during the period before the charges were dealt with.
<P>

12    	He attempted drug rehabilitation, but his success
was short lived.  At the time the charges against him were finalised at
Ryde
Local Court in October 1997, he had hoped to enter a residential drug
rehabilitation centre near Wollongong.  However, he was
unable to do so as the
magistrate imposed a term of periodic detention.  Thereafter, as he put it in
evidence, "I fell back into
my old pattern and began to use drugs as heavily as
I could."
<P>

13    	His father had assisted him financially since he
gave up work as a futures trader.  However, in the period leading up to
the
killing his father restricted the supply of money to him, confining him to
amounts required for specified legitimate purposes.
 Trust between them
deteriorated to such an extent that his father would keep a number of rooms in
the house locked, allowing him
access only to his own bedroom, the bathroom and
the kitchen.  Nevertheless, his evidence was that in the period between July
1997
and the killing his relationship with his father was better than it had
been for years. 
<P>

<b>The killing and its aftermath</b>
<P>

14    	All the more extraordinary then, are the events of
the night of Saturday, 1 November 1997 and the early hours of the following
morning.  Throughout the afternoon and evening of the Saturday the prisoner
consumed a large amount of Valium and marijuana, together
with several bottles
of beer.  His father had been keeping company with a lady, and in the early
evening he went out to join her
for a movie and dinner.
<P>

15    	The prisoner remained at home and at around 11pm he
began to have thoughts of killing his father.  In evidence he explained
the
experience in this way: 
<P>

I had thoughts in my head saying do it, do it, to kill my father.  To finish
something for once in your life, to not chicken out.
 Just those were repeating
over and over in my head.
<P>

He said that he did not wish to kill his father and the only explanation he
could offer for these thoughts was the "cocktail of
drugs" which he had
consumed.
<P>

16    	He went to the laundry and took up the piece of
metal pipe which he kept there.  His father arrived home about an hour later
and he struck him with the pipe as he entered the back door.  He said in
evidence that he could not remember how many times he hit
his father: it could
have been five blows but it may have been twenty-five.  He claimed that the
first blow stunned his father, causing
him to fall to the floor, and the other
blows were delivered while he was in that position.  This may be so, but there
is no denying
the ferocity of the attack.  Dr Johan Duflou, who conducted the
post-mortem examination, found that "there was massive head injury
with
extensive skull fracturing and destruction of brain tissue".
<P>

17    	There followed an elaborate and sustained attempt by
the prisoner to conceal his responsibility for the killing.  He sought
to make
it appear that his father had been robbed and killed by intruders.  He took
money and credit cards from the pocket of his
father's trousers.  He burnt the
metal pipe and a pair of rubber gloves with thinners, so that the remains of
the rubber gloves adhered
to the pipe.  He washed his blood stained clothing
and shoes, although he said in evidence that he had no memory of this.  Police
found the clothing in the washing machine.
<P>

18    	He showered, put on fresh clothes and made his way
to the casino in Darling Harbour.  He threw his father's credit cards
into the
water near the casino.  He remained there for some hours, consuming more Valium
and alcohol.  He was aware that he was likely
to have been filmed by a security
video camera at the casino and, indeed, such a videotape is an exhibit in these
proceedings.  Asked
in evidence whether he had gone to the casino to create a
false alibi, he said that that "may have been" the reason but it was not
his
"primary thought".  He added that he had been to the casino on many occasions
and he knew that it would be open.
<P>

19    	He returned home, and at about 5am he rang the OOO
emergency number and Eastwood police, claiming that he had come home to
find
his father dead.  When police and ambulance officers arrived, he told them that
he owed a substantial amount of money to drug
dealers and expressed the view
that it was he, rather than his father, who was the intended victim of the
attack.
<P>

20    	He maintained this stance in an electronically
recorded interview with police later that morning and a typewritten statement
which he signed, also on that day.  He claimed to have received threatening
phone calls from drug dealers and he alleged, as he had
to his father, that
they were responsible for the broken windows and graffiti several days
previously. He gave a detailed and exculpatory
account of his movements on the
night of the Saturday and the early hours of the Sunday, including his visit to
the casino.  He went
to the extent of supplying Christian names of two men said
to be drug dealers and an address at which they were said to live.  Three
days
later he participated in a videotaped "walk-around" at the home, in which he
maintained the same account.
<P>

21    	On 15 December 1997 he reported to police that he
himself had been robbed a few days earlier by two men as he returned home
in
the evening.  He did not suggest that he could identify those men, but the
effect of his account was to imply that the robbery
was connected to his drug
debts and, indirectly, to his father's death.  On 22 December he participated
in a further electronically
recorded interview, in which he maintained his
innocence but resiled from the suggestion that the drug dealers whom he had
named
were responsible for his father's death.  This did not allay the
suspicions of the police and on 29 December, after a search of the
home, he was
arrested and charged with the murder.  He has been in custody since that
date.
<P>

22    	It would seem that his sister entertained her own
suspicions and in January 1998, during a visit to him in custody, she extracted
his admission that he had killed his father.  On 6 February 1998, when the
charge was listed in a magistrate's court prior to the
committal proceedings,
his solicitor informed the court that he admitted involvement in the killing.
About a month later, he was
committed to this Court for trial after proceedings
in which no oral evidence was required.  It seems that, at that stage and for
some months thereafter, his legal representatives at that time managed his case
conservatively, exploring the possibility of a defence
based upon his mental
state at the relevant time.
<P>

23    	In late December 1998 or early January 1999, the
prisoner had his sister inform the police officer in charge of the
investigation
that he wished to be interviewed further about the matter.  At
that stage he no longer had legal representation.  As it happens,
that
interview could not be arranged until 17 March 1999.  In the course of it he
admitted having killed his father, giving the account
to which he adhered in
evidence before me.  He acknowledged that most of what he had previously told
police was false.  In particular,
he admitted that he had lied about being
indebted to drug dealers and about their involvement in the breaking of windows
and spraying
of graffiti at the home, and that his report of being robbed on 15
December 1997 was also a fabrication.
<P>

24    	The manner in which the prisoner set about
concealing his involvement in the crime, viewed in combination with the broken
windows and graffiti several days earlier, raises the suspicion that the
killing was conceived well before it occurred and was planned
with some care.
However, I am not satisfied that this was the case.  Indeed, in final
submissions the Crown prosecutor did not press
that view.  His argument was
that the prisoner's behaviour after the killing, including that depicted on the
casino's security video,
suggests that he was not as affected by drugs and
alcohol as he would have me believe.  On the other hand, it is likely that his
tolerance to drugs enabled him to mask the symptoms of intoxication to some
degree.  His sister gave evidence to that effect.  Of
itself, the fact that he
went to such lengths to cover his tracks does not necessarily mean that the
killing was planned.  It is
not uncommon even for a spontaneous killing to be
followed by an elaborate cover-up.  
<P>

25    	I approach the matter on the basis that the killing
occurred in the circumstances which the prisoner described in his confession
of
March of this year and in evidence before me.  There was a degree of
premeditation, although at a time when his judgment and reasoning
were clouded
by the ingestion of drugs and alcohol.  The attack upon his father was a savage
one, although its very ferocity is testament
to his abnormal state of mind.
<P>

26    	Dr Lucas did not diagnose a drug induced psychosis,
but expressed the view that the prisoner's "history of drug abuse and
probable
dependence on cannabis and benzodiazepines played an important part in his
actions".  Some light is thrown on this tragic
incident by the evidence of his
relationship with his father, which was at best ambivalent, but the killing
will never be satisfactorily
explained.  Although by no means a worst case, the
circumstances place the offence in a more serious category than the spontaneous
homicides more commonly encountered in this Court. 
<P>

<b>Victim Impact Statement</b>
<P>

27    	I received in evidence a Victim Impact Statement
from the prisoner's half-sister, the daughter of the deceased from a previous
relationship.  This woman had been adopted by a couple many years ago, but in
1997 she was progressing towards the re-establishment
of a relationship with
her natural father.  It is sad indeed that that process was brought to an end
by his untimely death.  The
Court expresses to her its sympathy in her tragic
loss as, of course, it does to the prisoner's natural sister, Mrs Ibrahim. 
<P>

28    	However, it is inappropriate that I should have
regard to that statement in assessing the sentence to be passed.  That has
been
the approach of this Court in many cases of this kind, and I see no reason to
depart from it in the present case.  The gravity
of the prisoner's crime must
be determined by reference to the facts as I have found them.  In accordance
with ordinary sentencing
principles, the sentence to be imposed must reflect
the seriousness of the offence, whilst having regard to the prisoner's
background,
his criminal record and his prospects of rehabilitation.
<P>

<b>Subjective case</b>
<P>

29    	Apart from the charges arising from the cheques he
stole from his father, to which I have referred, the prisoner has some
other
entries on his criminal record.  They are not serious and are of no present
consequence.  In lieu of the term of periodic detention
imposed at Ryde Local
Court, the prisoner has served a fixed term of five months since being taken
into custody in relation to this
matter.  Nevertheless, I shall date his
sentence from the date of his arrest, 29 December 1997.
<P>

30    	He has used his time in custody to foster his
rehabilitation.  He is described by Corrective Services authorities as a
competent
and willing worker.  He has undertaken courses in life skills.  More
importantly, he has been undergoing regular psychological counselling
to
address his personal problems and, in particular, his abuse of drugs and
alcohol.  The psychologist reports that he has been "enthusiastic
and highly
motivated" and has demonstrated "a commitment to a better understanding of
himself".  He gave evidence of his determination
to remain drug free upon his
release.
<P>

31    	He expressed remorse for his crime to Dr Lucas and,
on many occasions, to his sister, Mrs Ibrahim.  She gave evidence that
she
accepts it as genuine.  It is consistent with his confession earlier this year,
belated as it was.  It is also demonstrated by
his plea of guilty to murder, to
which significant weight should be given.
<P>

32    	He has had the benefit of the continuing support of
his sister and, until recently, regular contact with her five year old
daughter.  Sadly, the little girl died in a tragic accident a few weeks ago.  I
accept that the prisoner was devoted to her and it
is unfortunate that
arrangements could not be made for him to be escorted to the funeral.  I also
accept that her loss, and the unresolved
grief engendered by it, will make his
time in custody more difficult, although I do not think that this is a matter
to which much
weight can be afforded for the purpose of sentence.
<P>

33    	Obviously, the bizarre circumstances of this killing
raise a question whether the prisoner might remain a danger to society
upon his
release.  In his report Dr Lucas expressed his view in this way:
<P>

From the psychiatric viewpoint, I believe Mr Victorsen's risk of re-offending
in a violent way after his eventual release from prison
will be relatively low
provided he does not return to drug abuse.  Mr Victorsen is capable of further
education and if he avails
himself of opportunities to pursue this in prison
and undertakes the appropriate drug and alcohol counselling then his future
prospects
will be improved.  On release from prison he will require a
substantial period of supervision and will need to abstain from drugs
and
alcohol.
<P>

This, I think, is a sound assessment.  On the whole of the material before me,
I believe that his prospects of rehabilitation are
good.  Nevertheless, it is
in the community's interest that he be subject to the sanction of parole for a
lengthy period upon his
release, having the benefit of supervision for as much
of that period as the Probation and Parole Service considers appropriate.
Accordingly, I find special circumstances justifying an addition term somewhat
longer than the statutory norm.
<P>

<b>The sentence</b>
<P>

34    	The prisoner has asked that I take into account five
matters on a Form 1 when passing sentence.  They are offences committed
since
the death of his father and it is unnecessary to go to the detail of them.  The
charges are possessing cannabis, failing to
appear, forging and uttering a
prescription and making a false instrument.
<P>

William Peter Victorsen, on the charge of murder and taking into account the
matters on the Form 1, you are sentenced to penal servitude
for eighteen years.
That sentence will comprise a minimum term of thirteen years, commencing on 29
December 1997 and expiring on
28 December 2010, and an additional term of five
years, commencing on 29 December 2010 and expiring on 28 December 2015.
