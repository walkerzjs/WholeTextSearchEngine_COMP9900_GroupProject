<P>

<b>50138/1998 - SWINBANK  &amp; ORS v CLEARY &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	These two related sets of proceedings have  their genesis
in the collapse of the Estate Mortgage Trusts in April 1990.  The
primary issue
is as to whether a firm of solicitors who carried on practice in Brisbane under
the name "Cleary &amp; Hoare" and their
assignees who are the plaintiffs in the
proceedings, have rights of indemnity against a number of insurers under
contracts of professional
indemnity insurance (and excess insurance) entered
into by Cleary &amp; Hoare for the years commencing 1 July 1989, 1 July 1990
and
1 July 1991 [`Year 1', `Year 2' and `Year 3'].  A number of other issues
are also raised in the proceedings.
<P>

2   	An explanation of how each of the two sets of proceedings
now before the Court come to be pursued requires a degree of background.
<P>

<b>The parties to proceedings 50007/98 - "The main proceedings"</b>
<P>

3   	The plaintiffs in proceedings 50007/98 ("the main
proceedings") ("the Trustees") were appointed Trustees of the Meridian
Investment
Trusts (formerly known as "the Estate Mortgage Trusts") ("the
Trusts") by order of the NSW Supreme Court on 7 November 1990.
<P>

4   	Donald James Cleary, John Joseph Hoare and (from 1 January
1986) Graham Dennis Isles (`Cleary &amp; Hoare') carried on practice
as
solicitors in Brisbane under the firm name of Cleary &amp; Hoare.  By June 1990
a number of others, including Mr Scanlan, had
joined the firm as non-equity
partners, Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles at this time being the only equity
partners.
<P>

5   	Cleary &amp; Hoare entered into the subject contracts of
professional indemnity insurance (and excess insurance) for the three
years
referred to above.
<P>

6   	I note immediately that following late amendments to the
pleadings, an issue arose as to who were the parties to the subject
contracts
of insurance, namely whether each partner in the firm Cleary &amp; Hoare was
severally insured under a separate contract
or alternatively whether each
partner in the firm was severally insured under a single contract made by the
partnership.
<P>

7   	The defendants in the main proceedings ("the Insurers") are
the insurers under the policies.
<P>

<b>The Cleary &amp; Hoare proceedings</b>
<P>

8   	By a writ issued on October 22, 1991 the Trustees commenced
proceedings No 1802 of 1991 in the Supreme Court of Queensland
for breach of
retainer, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the
professional work of Cleary and Hoare for
the former trustee of the Trusts
("BPTC") on the PMA1 and PMA2 facilities ("The Cleary &amp; Hoare
proceedings").
<P>

9   	The Cleary &amp; Hoare proceedings were cross-vested to the
Supreme Court of  Victoria becoming proceedings 5870 of 1994 and
were heard
together with other proceedings brought by the Trustees against BPTC and
others.  The hearing of those proceedings commenced
in the Victorian Supreme
Court on 3 February 1997 and on 29 October 1997 consent judgments were given
for the Trustees against Messrs
Cleary, Hoare and Isles:
<P>

(a)	in the sum of $61,212,845 in respect of the PMA1 claim ("the PMA1 judgment
debt"); and
<P>

(b)	in the sum of $22,355,706 in respect of the PMA 2 claim ("the PMA2 judgment
debt").
<P>

<b>The PMA1 transaction</b>
<P>

10   	In November 1985, BPTC as trustee of the Trusts agreed to
lend PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Ltd ("PMA1") up to $20,650,000
("the PMA1
facility") for the acquisition of land at Southport in Queensland and the
development on the site of a 9 storey office
and shopping complex to be known
as the McDonnell &amp; East Centre ("the Southport project").
<P>

11   	Cleary &amp; Hoare were retained by Estate Mortgage
Managers Ltd ("EMM") to act as solicitors for BPTC in relation to the
preparation of loan and security documents in respect of the PMA1 facility.
EMM was manager of the Trusts.  Mr Richard Lew was a
director of EMM.  Mr
Reuben Lew was his father.
<P>

12   	The PMA1 facility included an arrangement ultimately
reflected in an Equity Sharing Agreement dated 13 November 1995 whereby
a
company, Weltsbarrd Pty Ltd ("Weltsbarrd") would become the holder of 50% of
the issued capital of PMA1 and be entitled to 50%
of the profits from the
Southport project.  Weltsbarrd was a company in which Mr Reuben Lew and Ms
Sandra Lew held the shares.  
<P>

13   	The PMA1 facility was increased in May 1986 to $24,600,000
and again in October 1986 to $30,000,000.  Cleary &amp; Hoare again
acted on
behalf of BPTC in relation to these transactions.  At the time of the second
increase in the PMA1 facility a further Equity
Sharing Agreement was prepared
by Cleary &amp; Hoare, pursuant to which Weltsbarrd continued to be entitled to
50% of the profits
of PMA1 and became entitled to 50% of the profits from the
sale of stage 2 of the Southport project.
<P>

14   	Mr Cleary was primarily responsible for preparing loan and
security documents relating to the PMA1 transaction and the Equity
Sharing
Agreement until about 14 November 1985 when Mr Scanlan took over the day to day
conduct of the transaction.
<P>

15   	Cleary &amp; Hoare's Solicitor's Certificate of 14
November 1985 was given to satisfy a condition precedent notified to PMA
1 in
EMM's letter of approval of the application for loan advance.  A letter which
had been copied to Cleary &amp; Hoare.  The letter
had stated:
<P>

<i>`8.	Solicitors Approval</i>
<P>

<i>	It is a condition precedent to the advancing of any monies by the Trustee
that the </i><cite>Trustee's solicitors investigate</cite><i> at your expense
and in their absolute discretion approve not only the title of the property
over which the Mortgage is to be given,
but also </i><cite>all matters which in
their opinion are incidental to the giving to the Trustee of an adequate and
proper security</cite><i>, including any special insurance and your compliance
with the terms of your application for this loan advance ...'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

16   	Notwithstanding the terms of this condition, Cleary &amp;
Hoare's 14 November 1985 Certificate omitted any mention of the
Equity Sharing
Agreement which they had prepared.  The Certificate relevantly stated:
<P>

`<i>Re Advance to PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Limited from Burns Philp
Trustee Company Limited - $20,650,000.</i>
<P>

<i>We refer to the letter of instructions from Estate Mortgage Managers Limited
dated 31 October 1985 and certify that we have prepared
and had executed the
following documents:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Deed of Loan</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Bill of Mortgage</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Guarantee and Indemnity</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Three Mortgage Debentures</i>
<P>

<i>4.	Mortgagees' Consent to Lease'</i>
<P>

17   	The Insurer's case is that BPTC was at all material times
unaware of the involvement of Mr Reuben Lew and Mrs Sandra Lew in
an Equity
Sharing Agreement which would give to a company of which they were the sole
shareholders, the right to 50% of the profits
to be made by PMA 1 from the
Southport project.  The Insurers' case is that Cleary &amp; Hoare deliberately
kept secret from BPTC
or failed to disclose, their knowledge or suspicion of
the Lews' financial involvement in the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions.  The
Insurer's case is that the terms and detail of the Equity Sharing Agreement
were concealed from the Trustees and that Cleary &amp;
Hoare's communications
to Mr Reuben Lew at EMM, written at the very same time as (or within a day or
so of) the issuing of the Solicitor's
Certificate, made detailed reference to
the Equity Sharing Agreement and to the securities collateral to that Agreement
which included
a second mortgage over the Southport properties.  The Insurer's
case is that the conduct of Cleary &amp; Hoare was such as to attract
the
`dishonesty' exclusion.
<P>

18   	The Insurer's case is that on the occasion of the
increased PMA 1 advance in late November 1985, Cleary &amp; Hoare first
prepared a Solicitor's Certificate addressed to BPTC which certified, inter
alia, that:
<P>

<i>`We certify that we have prepared the following additional documents in
connection with the borrower's purchase of two further properties
at
Southport.</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Bill of Mortgage (Deed of Loan)</i>
<P>

<i>2.	</i><cite>Bill of Encumbrance (Equity Sharing Agreement</cite><i>)</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Collateral documentation, including Minutes of Meeting and Certificate
pursuant to the Companies Code.'</i>
<P>

            [Emphasis added]
<P>

19   	The case is that following a telephone call from Mr Lew
advising that there was to be `no reference to [the Equity Sharing
Agreement]
in BP correspondence' and that all letters about that Agreement were to be kept
separate, Cleary &amp; Hoare revised the
wording of their Solicitor's
Certificate to remove the reference to the Equity Sharing Agreement and to
read:
<P>

<i>`We certify that we have prepared the following additional documents in
connection with the borrower's purchase of the final properties
comprising the
total development site at Southport:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Bill of Mortgage (Deed of Loan)</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Collateral documentation, including Minutes of Meeting and Certificate
pursuant to the Companies Code.'</i>
<P>

20   	The Insurer's case is that each of the later Solicitor's
Certificates of May 1986 (upon the further increase of the loan advance
to PMA
1), of July 1986 (upon settlement of the PMA 2 transaction) and of October 1986
(upon settlement of Stage 2 of the PMA 1 transaction),
omitted any reference to
the Equity Sharing Agreements and to the securities collateral to those
Agreements.
<P>

<b>The PMA2 transaction</b>
<P>

21   	In 1986 Cleary &amp; Hoare were retained by EMM to act for
BPTC in relation to a loan facility for PMA Development Company
No 2 Pty Ltd
("PMA2") for up to $14,000,000 ("the PMA2 facility") to purchase property at
Fairfield in Brisbane and for the development
on that site of a shopping centre
known as the Fairfield Chase Shopping Centre ("the Fairfield project").
<P>

22   	Cleary &amp; Hoare were retained in relation to the
preparation of loan and security documents in respect of the PMA2 facility.
Cleary &amp; Hoare also prepared an Equity Sharing Agreement dated 24 July 1986
by which Yossarian Nominees Pty Ltd ("Yossarian")
became a shareholder in PMA2
and entitled to 50% of the net profits of the Fairfield project.  Weltsbarrd
held the controlling interest
in Yossarian at the relevant time.
<P>

23   	Mr Peter Scanlan, then an employed solicitor, was the
solicitor primarily responsible for preparing the PMA2 documentation.
<P>

24   	As before, no reference was made in the Solicitor's
Certificate of 22 October 1986 to the Equity Sharing Agreement.
<P>

<b>Assignment</b>
<P>

25   	The Trustees claim an entitlement to bring the proceedings
because by deed made on 12 May 1999, Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles
assigned to
the trustees their right title and interest in the obligations of each of the
insurers under each of the 1989/1990, 1990/91
and 1991/92 policies.  As already
indicated, the Trustees put their claims as to the parties to the subject
contracts of insurance
in a number of alternative ways, those being:
<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

<b>Claim under the 1991/1992 policies</b>
<P>

26   	On or about 5 May 1992, Cleary &amp; Hoare notified each
of the insurers under the 1991/92 policies of a claim being the issue
of the
writ in the Cleary and Hoare proceedings.
<P>

27   	The Trustees claim in the main proceedings an entitlement,
as assignees of the Cleary and Hoare policies, to be indemnified
in the amount
of $45,000,000 in respect of the PMA1 judgment debt and the amount of
$22,355,706 plus accrued interest in respect
of the PMA2 judgment debt.
<P>

28   	The Trustees claim that each of the 1991/92 insurers is
liable to indemnify Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles to the full extent
of the
1991/92 policies in respect of each of the PMA1 judgment debt and the PMA2
judgment debt.
<P>

<b>Alternative Claim under the 1990/91 and 1989/1990 policies</b>
<P>

29   	If Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles are not entitled to
indemnity under the 1991/92 policies then the Trustees assert that they
are
entitled to be indemnified under the 1990/91 policies or alternatively under
the 1989/90 policies up to their respective limits.
<P>

30   	If the Trustees recover under the 1990/91 policies then
their claimed entitlement is to $10,500,000 in relation to PMA1 and
$10,500,000
in relation to PMA2.
<P>

31   	If the Trustees recover under the 1989/90 policies then
their claimed entitlement is to $4,000,000 in relation to PMA1 and
$4,000,000
in relation to PMA2.
<P>

<b>The defence in the main proceedings</b>
<P>

32   	The insurers point out that the Trustees have put
alternate claims for indemnity in respect of the three separate underwriting
years.  They point out and it is common ground that only one underwriting year
can possibly respond.   The grounds relied upon by
the insurers for denying
indemnity are as follows:
<P>

<b>1991/92 policy year</b>
<P>

(a)	Dishonesty by the insured;
<P>

(b)	Exclusion for "<i>known claim circumstances</i>"; and
<P>

(c)	Prior notification under the 1990/91 policy.
<P>

<b>1990/91 policy year</b>
<P>

(a)	Dishonesty by the insured; and
<P>

(b)	Exclusion for "<i>known claim circumstances</i>".
<P>

<b>1989/90 policy year</b>
<P>

(a)	Dishonesty by the insured; and
<P>

(b)	Section 54 of the Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a>  said not to apply.
<P>

33   	The insurers also raise an issue which will only require
to be determined if the trustees are otherwise entitled to indemnity,
as to
whether, if there is any entitlement to indemnity, the trustees are entitled to
characterise their claims as "<i>two claims</i>", thereby doubling the amount
of cover.
<P>

<b>The policy provision dealing with the "Dishonesty" exclusion</b>
<P>

34   	The policies for the subject three years all contain a
general exclusion in identical form.  This is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"(5)	(e)  This insurance shall not indemnify the Assured in respect of any
liability:</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	brought about by the dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of the
Assured including any partner or former partner of the Assured
or any person
employed in connection with the Practice (including any articled clerk and any
solicitor or conveyancer who is a Consultant
or Associate with the
Firm)."</i>
<P>

<b>The policy provision dealing with prior notification</b>
<P>

35   	The relevant "insuring clauses" for the subject three
years include the following provision:
<P>

<i>"(2)	On the terms and conditions herein contained the insurers shall
indemnify the Assured up to an amount not exceeding the Sum Insured
and Related
Costs against all loss to the Assured (including claimants' costs) whensoever
occurring arising from any claim or claims
first made against the Assured
during the Period of Insurance in respect of any description of civil liability
whatsoever incurred
in connection with the Practice other than loss arising out
of any circumstances or occurrence which has been notified under any
other
insurance attaching prior to the inception of the certificate of
insurance.</i>
<P>

<i>"Provided that:-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	For the purposes hereof all claims arising from the same act or
omission, whether made against one or more Assured, shall be regarded
as one
claim;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The liability of the Insurers under this Certificate of Insurance and
all other Certificates of Insurance issued under the Master
Policy in respect
of all claims arising from the same act or omission shall not exceed the Sum
Insured and Related Costs."</i>
<P>

<b>The policy provisions dealing with known claims or claims
circumstances</b>
<P>

36   	Each of the schedules, forming part of the certificate of
insurance, in respect of the cover for the 1990/91 policy year and
the 1991/92
policy year were endorsed with a special condition which provided:
<P>

<i>"Excluding any known claims or claims circumstances"</i>
<P>

37   	The insurers submit that this special condition is the
corollary of General Condition 4(b) and of the Insuring Clause (Clause
2)
already set out.  General condition 4(b) is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"(4(b))	The Assured shall give notice in writing to the Insurers as soon as
is practicable of any claim the subject of the Insuring
Clauses hereof made
during the Period of Insurance against the Assured or of the receipt of notice
from any person of any intention
to make a claim against the Assured.  The
Assured shall also give notice in writing as soon as practicable to the
Insurers of any
circumstances of which the Assured is or shall become aware
during the Period of Insurance which may give rise to a claim.  If notice
is
given to the Insurers under this paragraph any claim subsequently made (whether
before or after the expiration of  the Period
of Insurance) pursuant to such an
intention to claim or arising from circumstances so notified shall be deemed to
have been made
at the date when such notice was given."</i>
<P>

<b>The insurers claim that s 54 of the Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a> does not
apply</b>
<P>

38   	If the claim is held to fall within the 1990/91 policy
year, but fails because of the special condition excluding "known claims
or
claims circumstances", and upon the basis that the dishonesty exclusion was
held not to apply, the Trustees rely upon s 54 of
the Insurance <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a>,
so as to bring the claim within the 1989/90 policy year.  The insurers submit
that s 54 does not apply to the facts of this case.
 
<P>

39   	The broad submission is that the purpose of s 54 is to
overcome the effect of an omission by the insured in relation to action
which
is required under an existing contract of insurance which would otherwise
respond, but for the omission.  The insurers assert
that there must be an
omission by the insured in the invocation of an existing right under the
contract of insurance.  They point
out that the Trustees seek to invoke s 54 to
give to the Trustees a claim under the 1989/90 policy.
<P>

40   	The insurers then submit that the insured had no existing
right under the 1989/90 policy which was effected by reason of some
act or
omission on its part.  On the insurers' submissions, there was therefore no
"claim" actual or deemed, in the 1989/90 policy
year which the insurer was
entitled to refuse to pay by reason of some act or omission of the insured.
The submission is that in
relation to the 1989/90 policy year, there has been
no omission by the insured in the invocation of an existing right under the
policy.
 This is said to be because the circumstances did not give rise to a
right under the 1989/90 policies in the first place.  On the
insurers'
submissions the only way a right under the 1989/90 policies could arise is by
the attempt to invoke s 54.  The submission
is that s 54 cannot be used to
"create" a claim or "expand the scope of cover".  The submission is that the
purpose of s 54 is to
overcome an act or omission in the exercise of a right to
indemnity in the year in question.
<P>

<b>One or two claims</b>
<P>

41   	If the Trustees are otherwise entitled to indemnity, the
amount of indemnity will plainly be doubled if, as the Trustees contend,
there
are two claims and not merely one claim.  The insurers submit that Cleary &amp;
Hoare, when notifying circumstances and lodging
a claim, did not regard the
facts as giving rise to separate claims.  The submission is that the temporal
differences between the
PMA1 and PMA2 transactions are not distinct.  The
submission is that the transactions were identical in form and that the Equity
Sharing Agreements were identical in form.  The insurers accept that the Equity
Sharing Agreement for PMA2 was entered into after
the first, and before the
second, Equity Sharing Agreement for PMA1.  The insurers point out that the
funds advanced for PMA1 were
used for PMA2.  The submission is that the conduct
of Mr Cleary and Mr Scanlan was the same continuing conduct.  In essence the
insurers
submit that it was highly artificial and unnecessary for the Trustees
to seek two judgments against Cleary &amp; Hoare.  The submission
is that it is
obvious that this was done in an attempt to maximise the possible insurance
cover.
<P>

42   	Clause 2 in the certificate of insurance for the 1989 and
1990 primary policy has already been set out.  
<P>

43   	The issue then is whether there was one claim or two
claims against Cleary &amp; Hoare giving rise to the PMA1 and PMA2 judgment
debts.  If there were two claims, the issue becomes whether they should
nonetheless be regarded as one claim on the basis that they
arose from the same
act or omission.  As to whether there were one or two claims against Cleary
&amp; Hoare, the insurers submit
that the deliberate formulation by the
Trustees, of two separate causes of action in the further amended statement of
claim in the
Estate Mortgage litigation is not determinative.  Nor, on the
insurers' submission, is the artificial structuring of the settlement
so as to
produce two separate judgments determinative.
<P>

44   	If it is held that there were two claims, the insurers
submit that those claims arose from the same act or omission.  The
submission
is that the underlying act or omission which gave rise to the liability was the
concealment by Messrs Cleary and Hoare
of what the insurers assert was "their
knowledge of the personal involvement of the Lews and Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty
Ltd and Yossarian
Nominees Pty Ltd".  On the insurers' case the disclosure of
that knowledge by Cleary &amp; Hoare to BPTC, at any time prior to the
PMA1 and
PMA2 transactions being entered into, would have resulted in BPTC not approving
the recommendations of the EMM.  The insurers
submit that BPTC would not then
have incurred loss.  The insurers submit that no claim or claims would have
been made against Cleary
&amp; Hoare by BPTC or its successors in title.  On
the insurers' submissions the claims, properly characterised, arose out of the
same act or omission or even one act or omission, albeit it a continuing one,
on the part of Cleary &amp; Hoare, involving the concealment
from, and failure
to disclose to BPTC.
<P>

<b>Proceedings No 50138 of 1998 - The "good faith" proceedings</b>
<P>

45   	The second set of proceedings ("the good faith
proceedings") only become relevant should the Court find, contrary to the
position
of all insurers, that Messrs Cleary and Hoare were entitled to
indemnity under their 1991/92 policies of professional indemnity insurance.
<P>

46   	The proceedings arise out of the fact that the Trustees
originally took an assignment of the rights, if any, which Cleary
&amp; Hoare
had under their policies of insurance for the 1989/90 and 1990/91 policy years.
Following a later assignment, the main
proceedings were amended to permit the
making of an additional claim in respect of the 1991/92 policy year.
<P>

47   	The background to the good faith proceedings is that
Cleary &amp; Hoare, as has already been mentioned, were defendants in
the
Estate Mortgage proceedings brought by the Trustees, initially in Queensland
and subsequently transferred to Victoria.  Those
proceedings were settled as
between Messrs Cleary and Hoare and the trustees on 29 October 1997.  The
relevant effect of the settlement
was that in exchange for an assignment of
their rights under the 1989/90 and 1990/91 policies of professional indemnity
insurance,
Messrs Cleary and Hoare were released from any further liability.
<P>

48   	The Trustees in the main proceedings subsequently took the
view that there was a possibility that the claims which the solicitors
made
against their insurers may fall within a subsequent year's policy, namely the
policy for the 1991/92 policy year.  That position,
it should be said, is
disputed by the 1991/92 insurers.
<P>

49   	Subsequently Cleary &amp; Hoare and the Trustees, over the
objection of the 1991/92 insurers, rescinded the First Settlement
Agreement and
entered into a Second Settlement Agreement, the effect of which was to assign
the rights under the third policy year
(1991/92) to the Trustees.  This enabled
the Trustees to amend the main proceedings so as to sue the 1991/92 insurers.
The potential
liability of the insurers as a whole to the Trustees thereby rose
from $21,000,000 to $90,000,000.
<P>

<b>The claims by the 1991 insurers</b>
<P>

50   	The 1991/92 insurers claim in the "good faith" proceedings
that the rescission of the First Settlement Agreement, the entry
into the
Second Settlement Agreement and the Second Assignment was contrary to the term
of utmost good faith which was implied into
the policies for the 1991/92 policy
year by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a>.
<P>

51   	The insurers point out that under the First Settlement
Agreement, Cleary &amp; Hoare had been released of any further liability.
 The
insurers' case is that the agreement of Cleary and Hoare to participate in a
rescission and a further assignment, operated to
the disadvantage of the
1991/92 insurers in that it exposed the 1991/92 insurers to a substantial
additional claim by the Trustees
which would not have otherwise been available
to them.  The insurers' case is that Cleary &amp; Hoare's actions in agreeing
to this
course were encouraged, induced and assisted by the Trustees.  On the
insurers' case both sets of defendants, namely Messrs Cleary
Hoare and Isles
and the Trustees are liable in damage to the insurers, Cleary &amp; Hoare in
respect of their alleged breach of contract
and the Trustees because they were
involved in the tort of inducing the breach of contract.
<P>

52   	On the insurers' case the damages are comprised of the
liability faced by the 1991/92 insurers in the main proceedings brought
by the
Trustees as the result of the addition of claims in respect of the third policy
year.
<P>

<b>The defences to the good faith proceedings</b>
<P>

53   	The Trustees and Cleary &amp; Hoare defend the good faith
proceedings on the basis of an alleged breach by the 1991/92 insurers
of their
own duty of utmost good faith said to have been owed to Cleary &amp; Hoare.
The essence of the complaint is that the 1991/92
insurers misrepresented that
the claim fell within the 1990/91 policy year when in fact it is said to have
fallen within the 1991/92
policy year.  The defendants in the good faith
proceedings also allege estoppel arising from the same matters.
<P>

54   	In response, the insurers take the position that in so far
as Cleary &amp; Hoare were concerned, the respective arguments
as to the policy
years were advanced in correspondence between them and Cleary &amp; Hoare.  On
the insurers' case, that matter was
not further agitated by Cleary &amp; Hoare
after early 1992 when the insurers assert that they made their position clear.

<P>

55   	On the insurers' case there was thus no common mistake or
misrepresentation which would justify the defence and cross claims
of Messrs
Cleary and Hoare and the Trustees, whether put in contract or in estoppel.
Nor, on the insurers' case, were Cleary &amp;
Hoare entitled to rescind based
upon common mistake.
<P>

56   	In relation to the Trustees' claims, the 1991/1992
insurers dispute any alleged misrepresentation.  Their case is that the
1991/92
insurers' position was always communicated fairly to the Trustees.  Their case
is that to the extent that the Trustees proceeded
with any misconception, that
misconception did not arise from conduct on behalf of the 1991/92 insurers.
<P>

<b>Matters not in dispute</b>
<P>

57   	Most of the factual matters relating to the good faith
proceedings are not in dispute.  The Trustees commenced proceedings
No 5870 of
1994 in the Supreme Court of Victoria (originally proceedings No 1802 of 1991
in the Supreme Court of Queensland) against
Cleary &amp; Hoare ("the Estate
Mortgage proceedings") claiming losses to the trusts arising out of alleged
breaches of duty on the
part of Cleary &amp; Hoare in respect of the PMA1
transaction and the PMA2 transaction.
<P>

58   	The Estate Mortgage proceedings were settled as between
Cleary &amp; Hoare and the Trustees on 29 October 1997.  As part of
the
settlement Cleary &amp; Hoare and the Trustees entered into:  
<P>

(i)	a Settlement Agreement dated 29 October 1997 ("the first Settlement
Agreement");
<P>

(ii)	a Deed of Assignment by way of security dated 29 October 1997 ("the First
Deed of Assignment");
<P>

(iii)	a Power of Attorney dated 29 October 1997;
<P>

(iv)	Short Minutes of Order in Proceedings No 5870 of 1994; and
<P>

(v)	a Consent Order in proceedings No 5870 of 1994
<P>

(these documents are collectively referred to as "the First Settlement").
<P>

59   	Pursuant to the First Settlement, Cleary &amp; Hoare
consented to the PMA1 and PMA2 judgments against them in the Estate Mortgage
proceedings (Clause 1 of the First Settlement Agreement).
<P>

60   	Pursuant to the First Settlement Cleary &amp; Hoare agreed
that the Trustees may commence and prosecute proceedings against
Cleary &amp;
Hoare's insurers under the 1989/90 and 1990/91 primary and excess policies of
insurance in respect of the PMA1 and PMA2
judgment debts which were unsatisfied
("the Cleary &amp; Hoare insurance proceedings").
<P>

61   	Pursuant to the Deed of Assignment by way of security
Cleary &amp; Hoare assigned to the Trustees their right, title and interest,
whether at law or in equity, from time to time in and to the obligations of the
insurers under the 1989/90 and 1990/91 policies of
professional indemnity
insurance (Clauses 4.1 and 1.1 of the First Deed of Assignment).
<P>

62   	Pursuant to the First Settlement Agreement, the Trustees
agreed to accept the proceeds of any judgment or compromise in the
Cleary &amp;
Hoare insurance proceedings in full and final satisfaction of the PMA1 and PMA2
judgment debts respectively (Clause
11(b) of the First Settlement
Agreement).
<P>

63   	Pursuant to the First Settlement Agreement, the Trustees
agreed that if they did not by judgment or compromise recover any
indemnity in
the Cleary &amp; Hoare insurance proceedings in relation to the PMA1 and PMA2
judgment debts, then they would release
Cleary &amp; Hoare from any further
claim against them for the balance of any judgment debts and would execute and
deliver to them
a Deed of Release accordingly (Clause 11(c) of the First
Settlement Agreement).
<P>

64   	Pursuant to the terms of the First Settlement the Trustees
commenced the main proceedings.
<P>

65   	On or about 12 May 1999, the First Settlement was
purportedly rescinded by Cleary &amp; Hoare and the Trustees.  On that date
they entered into:
<P>

(i)	a Settlement Agreement dated 12 May 1999 ("the second Settlement
Agreement");
<P>

(ii)	a Deed of Assignment by way of security dated 12 May 1999 ("the Second
Deed of Assignment");
<P>

(iii)	an agreement between Cleary, Hoare, Isles, Scanlan, Murphy and Allen
<P>

(these documents are collectively referred to as "the Second Settlement").
<P>

66   	The rescission of the First Settlement and the entry into
the Second Settlement was over the express objections of the insurers
contained
in letters from their solicitors to Cleary &amp; Hoare and the Trustees dated
23 November 1998, 17 December 1998, 2 March
1999, 30 April 1999 and 7 May
1999.
<P>

<b>Principal Witnesses</b>
<P>

67   	Mr Scanlan was not a reliable witness.  I formed the view
that over the years since the happening of the events in question,
Mr Scanlan
has come to believe a version of those events which is inconsistent with the
strong probabilities given the contemporaneous
records and given the bulk of
the evidence.  He has clearly persuaded himself that at the material time he
saw nothing suspicious
in being asked to arrange for a Solicitor's Certificate
to be altered and in being instructed to keep separate, certain matters which
were not to be disclosed to BPTC.  His evidence and the lack of reliability as
to sections of it, is referred to below.
<P>

68   	Mr Cleary was not a reliable witness.  When confronted
with contemporaneous documents with which he was not familiar, he became
uneasy.   His oral evidence was often markedly inconsistent with clear
contemporaneous documentary records.  I formed the view that
in a number of
areas his evidence could not be accepted.  These matters are dealt with
below.
<P>

69   	Other witnesses are referred to below.
<P>

70   	It is appropriate to turn immediately to the facts.
<P>

71   	It is convenient to commence by setting out a short
overview chronology of the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions:
<P>

<i>`<b>PMA1 Transaction</b></i>
<P>

<i>1.	13.11.85	Deed of Loan: BPTC &amp; PMA1 (20.65 million)</i>
<P>

<i>2.	13.11.85	Equity Sharing Agreement: PMA1 and Welstbarrd</i>
<P>

<i>3.	14.11.85	Settlement of PMA1 - Initial advance - $2,650,000</i>
<P>

<i>4.	14.11.85	"Certificate" by Cleary &amp; Hoare</i>
<P>

<i>5.	28.11.85	Further advance - PMA1 - $3,765,972.83</i>
<P>

<i>6.	28.11.85	"Certificate" by Cleary &amp; Hoare</i>
<P>

<i>7.   30.5.86	Deed of Variation of Loan in PMA1: increased to $24.6
million</i>
<P>

<i>8.	30.5.86		"Certificate" by Cleary &amp; Hoare</i>
<P>

<i>	30.5.86		Further advance of $951,460.44</i>
<P>

<b><i>PMA2 Transaction</i></b>
<P>

<i>9.	26.6.86	Deed of Loan:  BPTC &amp; PMA1 ($14 million)</i>
<P>

<i>10.	28.7.86	Equity Sharing Agreement: PMA2 and Yossarian</i>
<P>

<i>11.	28.7.86	Settlement of PMA2</i>
<P>

<i>12.	28.7.86	"Certificate" by Cleary &amp; Hoare</i>
<P>

<b><i>PMA1 - Stage 2 Transaction</i></b>
<P>

<i>13. 20.10.86	Deed of Variation of Loan in PMA1: increased to $30
million</i>
<P>

<i>14.	20.10.86	Equity Sharing Agreement: PMA1 and Welstbarrd</i>
<P>

<i>15.	20.10.86	Settlement of PMA1 - Stage 2</i>
<P>

<i>16.	22.10.86	"Certificate" by Cleary &amp; Hoare'.</i>
<P>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

72   	The system followed within Cleary and Hoare's offices was
that where Mr Scanlan wrote a letter in draft and submitted it to
Mr Cleary or
co-operated with Mr Cleary in the drafting of a letter, Mr Scanlan's initials
`PJS' would appear on the letter together
with Mr Cleary's initials `DJC'.  [T
52]  Such situations would thus include `DJC:PJS [followed by the typist's
reference and certain
numerals]'.
<P>

<b>22 October 1985 - `Letter of Approval'</b>
<P>

73   	By letter dated 22 October 1985, EMM wrote to PMA1
(Attention Mr J Remo) formally advising that EMM had approved PMA1's
application
for a mortgage loan advance as a suitable investment by "the
Trustee" of the Estate Mortgage Trusts.  The letter of approval advised
that
the loan was to be primarily secured by a first registered mortgage over the
Southport property, the title details of which
were given, and was to be
subject to a number of detailed terms and conditions which were then set out.
The loan advance was to a
limit of $20,650,000 and was for a term of one
year.
<P>

74   	The loan approval included as conditions amongst others,
the following:
<P>

<i>"6.	Guarantors</i>
<P>

<i>The joint and several continuing guarantees as to the performance of the
Mortgage are required to be given by:</i>
<P>

<i>	D. J. Remo</i>
<P>

<i>	J. N. Potter ...</i>
<P>

<i>8.	Solicitors Approval</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>It is a condition precedent to the advancing of any monies by the
Trustee that the Trustee's solicitors investigate</cite><i> at your expense and
in their absolute discretion approve not only the title of the property over
which the Mortgage is to be given,
but also </i><cite>all matters which in
their opinion are incidental to the giving to the Trustee of an adequate and
proper security</cite><i>, including any special insurance </i><cite>and your
compliance with the terms of your application for this loan advance</cite><i>
...</i>
<P>

<i>14.	Further Encumbrances</i>
<P>

<i>	The security property shall not be further encumbered without the written
consent of the Trustee.</i>
<P>

<i>15.	Variation of Shareholders/Directors</i>
<P>

<i>	No change in the shareholders or directors of the mortgagor company shall
be permitted without the prior written consent of the Trustee
...</i>
<P>

<i>18.	Valuation Qualification Requisitions</i>
<P>

<i>	Prior to settlement the Borrower shall deliver to the Trustee's solicitors
Cleary &amp; Hoare, documentation, in such form as may
be approved by Cleary
&amp; Hoare, evidencing the following ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	Equity participation arrangements."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

[On Mr Cleary's evidence a copy of this letter was received by him on or about
24 October 1985, being the same day on which a meeting
took place which is
referred to below.   Mr Cleary regarded the letter as recording the
instructions given to his firm, later and
in more formal terms appearing in
EMM's letters to Cleary and Hoare, of 31 October 1985]
<P>

<b>23 October 1985 - Project Summary</b>
<P>

75   	By letter dated 23 October 1985, EMM wrote to BPTC in
relation to the Southport project setting out a project summary and
professional reports said to support EMM's decision to recommend available
security to BPTC for the investment of Estate Mortgage
`Trust' Funds to finance
the development of a new shopping centre at Southport.
<P>

76   	The letter detailed the subject site and the project. 
<P>

77   	Under the heading "Financial Structure" a number of
details were given including the following:-
<P>

<i>"PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Ltd (name to be changed) incorporated 1985
to undertake this Southport Shopping Centre Venture.
 No previous
trading.</i>
<P>

<i>Directors:   David James Remo</i>
<P>

<i>                   John Norman Potter</i>
<P>

<i>Shareholders:  Remo and Potter - 50%</i>
<P>

<i>. . . </i>
<P>

<i>Mortgagee: Burns Philp Trustee Company Limited as Trustee for Estate
Mortgage Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>Mortgagor:  PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Ltd</i>
<P>

<i>Guarantors: Remo and Potter </i>
<P>

<i>Loan:  ...  $20,650,000."</i>
<P>

78   	This letter further detailed the subject security and
included a profile of the developers.  It advised that the directors
David
James Remo and John Potter were known to most major retailers and that a close
relationship had been developed with most food
retailers in the country.  It
gave the personal details of Mr David James Remo and Mr John Norman Potter
including their detailed
assets and liabilities.
<P>

79   	On a subsequent occasion, as Mr Cleary conceded in
evidence, he altered the description of the directors of  PMA1 in the above
letter by removing the name John Norman Potter and replacing it by a reference
to David John Bentley.  A subsequent version of the
23 October 1985 letter from
EMM to BPTC was then issued naming the directors as David James Remo and David
John Bentley, identifying
the shareholders as "Remo and Bentley - 50%" and
giving the personal details, assets and liabilities of Mr Bentley.
<P>

<b>24 October 1985 - `The Gold Coast Meeting giving instructions'</b>
<P>

80   	On 24 October 1985 a meeting took place at PMA's office at
the Gold Coast attended by Messrs James Remo, Dennis Bentley, John
Hilmer
solicitor, Reuben Lew, Richard Lew and Mr Cleary.  There are two diary notes by
Mr Cleary relating to this meeting.  The first
is a three page handwritten
diary note and the second is a two page typed note.  These notes are appended
to this judgment as appendices
1 and 2.  The handwritten note includes the
words "Joint Venture [Agreement] - Shareholding or side [Agreement][ ] Costs
spelt out."
   [An arrow appears before the words `Costs spelt out']  The
typewritten note uses the words `side agreement covering equity sharing'.
<P>

81   	Mr Cleary accepted under cross-examination that he
received instructions at this meeting, the Equity Sharing Agreement being
indicated as a priority to be resolved first [Transcript 138].  His evidence
was that he understood that another party would be contributing
funds and that
that party would, in addition to interest, receive the benefit of any increase
in value of the property over a certain
figure.  [T 138]
<P>

82   	On Mr Cleary's evidence:
<P>

(a)	Mr Remo, Mr Bentley and Mr Hilmer represented one group - being the PMA
companies.  [T 172]
<P>

(b)	Mr Reuben Lew and Mr Richard Lew represented EMM.
<P>

(c)	EMM represented the `entity' which would in due course share in the profits
with the borrower, the name of that entity not then
being known:
<P>

	`Q.	Who did you think was the person who controlled [the question looses its
impact in the transcript but was plainly read as -
"the entity"]
<P>

A.	I don't know.  There was no discussion about who the entity would be.'   [T
172]
<P>

<b>25 October 1985</b>
<P>

83   	By letter dated 25 October 1985 bearing Mr Cleary's
reference, Cleary &amp; Hoare wrote to "Mr Reuben Lew, Director, Estate
Mortgage Managers Limited, Level 45, Naurau House, 80 Collins Street
Melbourne."
<P>

84   	This letter was in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"Re Proposed Advance Burns Philp Trustee Company Ltd to PMA Development

<P>

<i>	We make the following observations with regard to our document.</i>
<P>

                       [Emphasis added]               
<P>

85   	A question arises as to precisely what draft agreement was
enclosed with Cleary &amp; Hoare's letter of 25 October 1985 already
referred
to.  Mr Cleary's evidence was that a form of draft agreement possibly the
second or third version postdating that enclosed
with the 25 October 1985
letter is that which is appended to this judgment and marked     Appendix 3.
It will be noted from that
version of the agreement that the address of XYZ
Company Pty Ltd was given as 51 Pitt Street Sydney with its principal office in
Queensland at Level 15, MLC Court 15 Adelaide Street Brisbane.  51 Pitt Street
Sydney was the address of BPTC in Sydney.  The Adelaide
Street, Brisbane
address was the address of EMM at the time.

transaction</cite><i>.  Prior to settlement, all your searches and enquiries
must be resolved satisfactorily and the Trustee/Mortgagee must be in receipt
of
a certified copy of the mortgage as executed by the Mortgagor, together with
your Certificate as to Title.  The Mortgagee will
not require to execute this
mortgage which may be accepted by you on its behalf ...".</i>
<P>

[emphasis added]
<P>

90   	The schedule attached to this letter identified the
mortgagee as BPTC and the mortgagor as PMA1.  It identified the security
as
being `Registered First Mortgage of the land described in the attached Sworn
Valuation Report by A C Arnold &amp; Associates dated
3 October 1985 in respect
of the property subject of the report'
<P>

91   	The schedule included a number of special conditions and
of particular importance, the following special conditions:
<P>

<i>"6.	The Security property </i><cite>shall not be further
encumbered</cite><i> without the written consent of the Trustee.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	</i><cite>No change in the Shareholders or Directors of the Mortgagor
Company shall be permitted without the prior written consent of the
Trustee</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

                         [emphasis added]
<P>

92   	On Mr Cleary's evidence, most of the work of the
transaction had already been carried out by the time this letter was received.
He accepted that it was likely he would have read the letter and understood the
instructions.  [T 126/127]
<P>

93   	Mr Cleary accepted that the 31 October letter contained
the final instructions to his firm prior to the ultimate settlement,
these
being to use his words `the official instructions'.  [T 129]
<P>

94   	Mr Cleary accepted that the information given to him on 24
October in the earlier letter of 22 October, was superseded by
the later
instructions given to him in the letter of 31 October.  The letter of 31
October showed the guarantors as Mr Remo and Mr
Bentley.  The letter of 22
October had shown the guarantors as Mr Remo and Mr Potter.  [T 128]
<P>

95   	Mr Cleary under cross-examination, at transcript 151 and
following, accepted that the letter of 31 October 1985, being the
official
instructions letter, related only to one part of the overall transaction,
namely the loan transaction and did not relate
to the Equity Sharing Agreement
or give any instructions in relation to the terms of the Equity Sharing
Agreement.  He accepted that
neither the letter nor the schedule which came
with the letter contained any reference or instructions relating to an Equity
Sharing
Agreement.
<P>

96   	At transcript 153, Mr Cleary accepted under
cross-examination that he knew that it was normal to require the individuals
who
stood behind the borrower company to provide guarantees and that he knew
that the loan transaction contained a prohibition against
any change in the
shareholders in the borrower company.  His further evidence was as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	</i><cite>The other part of the transaction not recorded in what you
call the official instructions dated 31 October 1985 involved the equity
sharing agreement, didn't it</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was the second part of the overall transaction which was
occurring?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, it turned out to be the first part that was done and most of this
transaction was done before I received the letter dated
31 October and the
transaction documents were prepared based on the letter dated the 22nd.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The equity sharing agreement involved, did it not, a further encumbrance
or a mortgage over the land?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It involved a complete change in the shareholders in the borrower
company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>It involved not obtaining guarantees from one of the new
shareholders of the borrower company?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, who was a lender.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Just say that again?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Who was a lender to the transaction.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who was a lender?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Weltsbarrd.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Weltsbarrd was a lender?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Weltsbarrd was contributing money by way of a syndicate to the
transaction.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is the honest evidence which you give?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You referred to the instructions in relation to the equity sharing
agreement yesterday as variations to your official instructions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Those variations involved on their face, did they not, a variation from
the requirements of the special conditions in the official
instructions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, an extension and variation of them, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Those variations, for that reason, were inconsistent with some of the
instructions in the letter dated 31 October?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the variations were not for the benefit of the trustee, were
they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I thought they were.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Why might that have been?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because moneys were being lent by this entity and at the high risk end of
the transaction.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Those variations to your official instructions also operated to the
benefit of the party which was described in the equity sharing
agreement as the
second shareholder, didn't they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Who was the second shareholder?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If the property increased in value . . .'</i>

<b>5 November 1985</b>
<P>

97   	By memorandum dated 5 November 1995, from Mr Cleary to Mr
Les Priddle, then a consultant of Cleary &amp; Hoare, Mr Cleary
stated:
<P>

<i>`Attached hereto are copies of the following . . .</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Equity Sharing Agreement</i>
<P>

<i>I would be pleased if you would go through the Memorandum and Articles of
Association of the Company with a view to advising what
amendments should be
made, if any, to ensure that our</i><cite> financier client's
interes</cite><i>t in the Equity Sharing Agreement cannot be diluted.</i>
<P>

<i>We are covered to and extend [sic] under the Deed of Loan but I want to take
it a step further and ensure that our rights are not
lost in the event of
fraud, etc.  Perhaps we need some clauses along the lines that no further
shares can be issued, redeemed, etc
without the consent of all existing
shareholders.</i>
<P>

<i>I stress that this will be one of the most important drafting exercises you
undertake in 1995 because </i><cite>I expect that more than $20 million will be
distributed under the Equity Sharing Agreement within three
years</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Again I want to ensure that all the necessary cheques and balances are there
in the Articles so that the directors cannot even fraudulently
delete</i><cite>
our client's</cite><i> interest as a 50% shareholder in the beneficial interest
of the property.  There are no trusts.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

98   	Under cross examination in relation to this document at
transcript 176, Mr Cleary was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And when you referred in the next paragraph to no further shares being
issued you were referring to a desire on your part to ensure
that the 50%
interest of the entity to be nominated by Reuben Lew or Richard Lew would not
be diluted?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And in the next paragraph you emphasised to Mr Priddle that you expected
the very large sums of money to be distributed under the
equity sharing
agreement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.  Well it speaks for itself.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And what you meant by that was pursuant to the profit share obligations
your client, that's the party with the 50% interest, which
is not the PMA
party, could be expected to receive substantial sums of money in the order of
that which you have mentioned in the
penultimate paragraph?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Pursuant to the profit share obligations under the agreement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i> . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And you said in your statement in paragraph 66 that you did not
turn your mind particularly to the fact that Weltsbarrd and Yossarian
could
have obtained a substantial economic benefit from the PMA transaction, do you
see that?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And this memorandum from you to Les Priddle clearly indicated
on 5 November you were turning your mind very specifically to the very
substantial economic benefit which might result from the PMA 1
transaction?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>, that's what that memo says.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And your statement in paragraph 66 is not a fair reflection of your state
of mind in November 1985 is it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am not qualified to be a valuer and I don't know what the valuations
were likely to be in the future.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are you suggesting that the figure of $20million bore no resemblance to
reality?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	This was a number pulled out of the sky . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	. . . </i><cite>You knew that there were substantial sums of money
involved</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i> . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 176-177]
<P>

99   	By letter dated 5 November 1985 bearing Mr Cleary's
reference, Cleary &amp; Hoare wrote to Mr Reuben A Lew, Financial Consultant,
Estate Mortgage Financial Services Limited in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`Re Burns Philp Trustee Company Limited Advance to PMA Development
Corporation No 1 Pty Limited</i>
<P>

<i>We refer to our telephone conversation with you on the 4th instant and
enclose final draft copy Equity Sharing Agreement which has
been approved by
the Borrower.</i>
<P>

<i>Please confirm that the document is acceptable to you and in order that we
may prepare it in final form, we request your further instructions
with respect
to the following:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	The name of </i><cite>your associated company</cite><i> to be involved to
be "the second shareholder" to the agreement . . .'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

100   	Under cross examination in relation to this letter, Mr
Cleary gave the following evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	In any event whatever words you used in your statement the company about
which you were seeking instructions was one which you
knew was associated with
Reuben Lew wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Was it associated with Estate Mortgage?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And Reuben Lew was the principal spokesman for Estate Mortgage?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	On mortgage matters yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	On all matters wasn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who was?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	His wife?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Your question was, was Reuben the principal spokesman for all matters for
Estate Mortgage.  They had a chairman, various officers,
he was the person that
I dealt with in respect to mortgage matters but there were many other people
that had all sorts of other roles
in the company.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But you knew he was the founder of the Estate Group?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't know the history of Estate Mortgage.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>When you sought his instructions in the expectation that he
would become a client of yours you went to him did you not?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you knew that the Equity Sharing Agreement was part of the overall
loan transaction for the PMA 1 document didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you have told his Honour and you have said in your statement in
paragraph 30 that Reuben Lew was the principal decision maker
at least so far
as instructions for loans were concerned?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that's the context in which we are looking at this matter now, isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

[T 180-181]
<P>

101   	Mr Cleary was cross examined in relation to paragraph 66
of his statement.  it is convenient to set out paragraphs 65 and
66.  They were
as follows:
<P>

<i>'65.	I did not know, at the time of the PMA transactions, that Mr Reuben Lew
was in effective practical control of Weltsbarrd and
Yossarian or that he was
involved with those companies.</i>
<P>

<i>66.	I did know although I did not turn my mind to it particularly that
Weltsbarrd and Yossarian could obtain a substantial economic
benefit from the
PMA transactions.  I did not know that they would obtain a substantial economic
benefit.  As second mortgagees they
could have obtained a substantial economic
benefit or they could have lost money.'</i>
<P>

102   	At transcript page 178, Mr Cleary accepted that the first
sentence of paragraph 66 `could have been expressed better than
it has been'.
The cross examination included the following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Are you denying Mr Cleary, that you were aware of and conscious of the
very substantial potential economic benefit which the equity
sharing agreement
would provide for the entity to be nominated by Mr Reuben Lew or Richard
Lew?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was aware of the potential for significant sums to be paid under the
equity share agreement if the value of the property increased.
 I am not a
commercial person.  I wasn't prepared to give commercial advice.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you did turn your mind to that potential?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can't recall.  Clearly there are large sums of money and if the
property increased in value there would be significant sums of
money.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is not true to say you did not turn your mind particularly to that
fact?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As to how much?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	To the fact that Weltsbarrd could obtain a substantial economic
benefit?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was aware that Weltsbarrd, the entity that generally turned out to be
Weltsbarrd, could derive significant benefits under the
documents, the quantum
of which I didn't exercise my mind about.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is not true to say you did not turn your mind particularly to the fact
Weltsbarrd could obtain a substantial economic benefit?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Could obtain - that would be in effect, they could have obtained.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>What you are saying, I think, is that paragraph [66] in the
first sentence in so far as it refers to Weltsbarrd is not correct?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It could have been expressed better than it has
been</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And it is equally not correct in relation to Yossarian isn't
it?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It could have been expressed better than it has
been</cite><i>.'</i>

<b>November 1985 - Memorandum</b>
<P>

103   	The Cleary &amp; Hoare file includes a memorandum which,
in its present form, is unclear as to the date.  The date 8 November
1985 can
be made out but there is a pin hole through the original just before the `8',
so that the date could have been 8 November
1985 or 18 November 1995 or 28
November 1985.  Subject to that question of date, the note reads:
<P>

<i>`Mr Lew telephoned - requested us to </i><cite>write separately to
him</cite><i> regarding Welstbaard [sic] matters on the one hand and Burns
Philp matters on the other.'</i>

<P>

<i>`Profit Share Company - Welstbarrd Holdings Pty Limited Level 15, 500
Collins Street, Melbourne Vic 3000'</i>
<P>

105   	In relation to this document, the cross examination of Mr
Cleary includes the following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Weltsbarrd was your client?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It had always been clear to you from 24 October that the profit share
company was one for which you were acting?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Receiving instructions, yes, from Estate Mortgage.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The company name was nominated from Estate Mortgage Managers wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You had always known Reuben Lew would nominate the name of that company
for you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That Estate Mortgage would, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can you name anyone in the world other than Mr Lew who on the
information available to you at that time, to your knowledge, stood
behind
Weltsbarrd?</cite>

106   	By letter dated 11 November 1995, Cleary &amp; Hoare
(signed by Mr Cleary), wrote to Messrs Rylands &amp; Hilmer, the borrowers'
solicitors, in relation to the PMA Development Company No. 1 Pty Limited
advance from BPTC of $20,650,000.
<P>

107   	Cleary &amp; Hoare confirmed that they acted on behalf of
BPTC in connection with the advance and enclosed a number of documents.
 The
list of documents enclosed with this letter can be conveniently divided into
two particular categories.  The first are those
documents relating to the Deed
of Loan and security documents pertinent to it.  The second category relate to
the Equity Sharing
Agreement and collateral documents pertinent to it.  The
first category included for example, the original and eight copies of the
Deed
of Loan and the original and two copies of the Bill of Mortgage.  The second
category included for example, the original and
two copies of the Equity
Sharing Agreement and a number of collateral documents to that Agreement
including the Bill of Encumbrance.

file note is appended to this Judgment as Appendix 3.  The note is
in Mr
Cleary's handwriting.  At transcript 188.5, he accepted that it was safe to
assume that the handwritten words on the document
came into existence prior to
the completion of the documents on or about 13 November 1985.
<P>

111   	Mr Cleary was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And you have recorded in the middle of the page the words: One share to
our entity?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And : One share to be held by PMA Property Corporation?</i>

not</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, the other entity to PMA Properties . . .</i>
<P>

[T 188]
<P>

112   	Mr Cleary's evidence was that the file note seemed to be
some sort of running reminder sheet in relation to matters which
had to be
attended to in the fulfilment of his responsibilities in acting for Weltsbarrd
in connection with the Equity Share Agreement.
 [T 187]

<b>The First Solicitor's Certificate</b>
<P>

128   	By letter dated 14 November 1985, Cleary and Hoare
[signed by Mr Cleary] to the Manager, Burns Philp Trustee Company Limited,
Cleary and Hoare purported to certify as to which documents had been prepared
and executed.  The letter was in the following terms:
<P>

`<i>Re Advance to PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Limited from Burns Philp
Trustee Company Limited - $20,650,000.</i>
<P>

<i>We refer to the letter of instructions from Estate Mortgage Managers Limited

<i>We certify we have investigated the titles to land and the Companies which

<i>We certify that :</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There are no adverse notifications, easements, encumbrances or interests
which would affect your title as Mortgagee.</i>
<P>

<i>B.	All proper investigations have revealed no other matters which would
adversely affect the proposed security.</i>
<P>

<i>The borrower has requested an initial advance today in the sum of $2,650,000
. . .'</i>
<P>

129   	Mr Cleary under cross examination in relation to the
Certificate, was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And you stated that "We", that is the firm of Cleary &amp; Hoare "have
prepared and have executed certain documents"?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The documents are numbered 1, 2, 3, but there is a second 3 and 4?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>That is not a complete statement of all the documents which the
firm of Cleary &amp; Hoare have or had prepared</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Nor is it a complete statement of all of the documents which
the firm of Cleary &amp; Hoare have had prepared and have had
executed</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is only half true to say that you have prepared the five categories of
documents set out in the letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, it does not refer to the other document.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And therefore,</i><cite> it is only half true</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>If you put it that way</cite><i>.  It does not refer to the
other document.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You agree, do you that it is half true</cite><i> because of the
failure to refer to the other documents?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Well, yes</cite><i>.  Well, it does not refer the other
document.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And therefore, it does not give a complete statement of all of the
documents which you had prepared and had executed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is right.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can we assume that you wrote the letter
intentionally</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You chose the words in the letter
deliberately</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That the letter was not accidental or inadvertent?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I assume so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The letter does not give the reader of it the whole truth in relation to
all of the documents, which had been prepared and executed
does it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It does no talk about the other documents.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You knew the whole truth about all the documents didn't
you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>We had prepared other documents, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You intended the trustee to rely on the letter, didn't
you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The letter gave a false impression to the reader of it about the
documents which you had prepared and had executed didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It did not mention all the documents.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It gave a false impression didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well it mentioned all the documents that Burns Philp was a party
to.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It gave a false impression of the documents which to use your words "we
had prepared and had executed"?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

	. . .
<P>

<i>Q.	You chose to refer to the documents which you have itemised?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you chose not to refer to the other documents, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, that is on the face of the letter, that is correct . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 193-195]
<P>

130   	At transcript 195 the following questions were asked and
answered:
<P>

<i>`His Honour:   Q.	Why did you address this Certificate to the Trustee
Company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because, your Honour, that is the requirement under the Trustee Deed and
what I thought was the requirement at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And why did you think it was a requirement that your firm give a
Certificate to the Trustee?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I do not know that I can answer that.  Reconstructing from the file, I
noticed that at some stage I gave a certificate to the manager
and, at that
stage, I must have assumed we had to certify to the manager and there is this
certificate to the trustee.  Now whether
someone brought that to my attention I
am not sure but on reconstructing from the file, there is a requirement under
the Trust Deed
to certify to the trustee.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you signed this certificate you were aware, were you not, that it
was a certificate to the trustee and not to the Estate Mortgage
managers?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Pembroke  Q.	And you have already said to his Honour that you recognised
that there were express duties imposed upon you as part of
your instructions to
provide certain certifications and disclosures to the Trustee?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And they are the duties set out in the letters of 22 and 31
October?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you were purporting to fulfil those duties when you wrote the letter
of 14 November 1985 weren't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That was part of the process . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You did not perform your duty to certify to the Trustee in relation to
all of the other matters, which you [recognised] you were
obliged to certify
other than by this letter of 14 November, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can only assume that I believed I was certifying what I had to by
virtue of this letter.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That document certifies to the trustee not the manager?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	To the trustee, sorry.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>A second mortgage to Weltsbarrd is a matter relevant to title,
isn't it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>This document does not certify in any way directly or
indirectly to the second mortgage given to Weltsbarrd, does
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So it does not even comply with the narrow obligation which you sought to
take comfort in in relation to certification as to title,
does it.  Would you
like the question repeated?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it does not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	. . . The omission to refer in this letter to the second mortgage in
relation to Weltsbarrd was deliberate wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was not an inadvertent omission, was it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I really do not know what went through my mind at the
time</cite><i>   . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 196-197]
<P>

131   	Also by letter dated 14 November 1985 from Cleary &amp;
Hoare (signed by Mr Cleary), that firm wrote to `Mr Reuben A Lew,
Financial
Consultant, Estate Mortgage Managers Limited' in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`Re Advance to PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Limited from Burns Philp
Trustee Company Limited $20,650,000</i>
<P>

<i>We refer to our letter dated the 12th instant and confirm that we today
forwarded a certificate to Burns Philp Trustee Company Limited.</i>
<P>

<i>We request that you confirm the interest provisions in Clauses 1.07, 1.26
and 6.0 of the Deed of Loan.  Also please confirm satisfactory
insurance has
been arranged.</i>
<P>

<i>With reference to our letter to Messrs Rylands &amp; Hillmer dated the 11th
November we comment further as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	All security documents have been signed except the guarantee of the
Equity Sharing Agreement which will be signed prior to settlement.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	. . . </i>
<P>

<i>The sum of $22 million has been inserted in clause 1.10 of the Equity
Sharing Agreement.  We request that you advise today in writing
whether this is
acceptable to you.'</i>
<P>

<b>15 November 1985</b>
<P>

132   	By letter dated 15 November 1985 bearing Mr Cleary's
reference, Cleary and Hoare wrote to "The Director, Weltsbarrd Holdings
Pty
Ltd, 19 Short Street, Southport, Queensland" advising:
<P>

<i>"Re:  Advance to PMA Development Company No 1 Pty Ltd from Burns Philp
Trustee Company Ltd $20,650,000.</i>
<P>

<i>We enclose herewith our cheque in the sum of $1.00 pursuant to the terms of
the Equity Sharing Agreement."</i>
<P>

[I interpolate that some nine months later by letter bearing Mr Scanlan's
reference and dated 20 August 1986, Cleary and Hoare wrote
to "Mr Partridge,
PMA Development Company No 2 Pty Ltd, 19 Short Street, Southport, Queensland",
returning the Company Registers
inter alia for PMA Development Company No 2 Pty
Ltd into which a number of formal documents had been placed including those
constituting
the share transfers from J E Remo to Yossarian Nominees Pty Ltd
and from D J Remo to P M A Property Corporation Pty Ltd.  The letter
also
enclosed documents for insertion into the Company Registers of PMA Property
Corporation Pty Ltd, PMA Development Corporation
Pty Ltd and PMA Development
Corporation NO 1 Pty Ltd.  The Short Street address is also noted in the Equity
Sharing Agreements as
the registered office of the PMA Companies.  I infer that
the cheque for $1.00 enclosed with the letter of 15 November 1985 comprised
payment for one share in PMA1 owed to Mrs Remo - although the reason why the
letter was addressed to Weltsbarrd remains unclear.
 Possibly a shelf company
and change of names situation explains this circumstance.]
<P>

133   	By letter dated 15 November 1985 bearing Mr Cleary's
reference, Cleary &amp; Hoare wrote to Mr Reuben A. Lew, Financial Consultant,
EMM in the following terms:

copy of  the letter
was tendered as exhibit PX14 and did not include the

<P>

135   	Cross examination in relation to this document at
transcript 191 and following includes the following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . what you have recorded on the second page is that you have written
the words "that interest was held beneficial for EM"
with an arrow pointing to
Weltsbarrd Holdings.  Is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It appears to be, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And that is the understanding which you had in November 1985,
isn't it?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, it is not</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it is the understanding which you had when you wrote the note, isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I do not know when that note was written.  It may have been written when
I - one of the statements along the way was being prepared,
but that is not the
understanding that I had at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is the understanding that you had when you wrote the note is it
not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I do not know what that is.  It is sort of like a "no search of company,
certified not related".  It is sort of like commentary.
 I do not know.  I do
not know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you agree that the words written in your hand namely, that interest
was held beneficially for EM with an arrow pointing to Weltsbarrd,
indicate a
state of mind which you had to Weltsbarrd at the time you wrote the
note?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I do not know I just - it is not the understanding I had at the time.
That note may have been written in the course of preparation
of a statement.  I
do not know.  I cannot . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But whether it was written at the time of preparation of the statement or
at some other time it represents your understanding at
the time you wrote the
note, doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Well, it is not my understanding</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are you having difficulty with this note because it is not one of the
documents you looked at in preparation for giving evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you see that a copy of the letter with your handwriting on it in the
course of preparing to give your evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And it does not sit consistently with the evidence you have
given in this case, does it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can you give any explanation as to why you have written that
note on the copy of the letter</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, I do not know when the note was written</cite><i>.  I
presume it was written after 1990 and just whether it was a question or
something to be considered, I just do not know but it
is not consistent with
the understanding at the time.</i>

this letter was written, would be `pleased to know' of the smaller
amount of
assessed stamp duty.  He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You wrote the letter on 29 November to Reuben Lew, Financial Consultant,
Estate Mortgage Managers?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Informing him that you were delighted with the assessment by the
Commissioner?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you wrote that letter because you thought that he would be pleased to
know?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Estate Mortgage would be pleased to know, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour  Q.	Why would they be pleased to know?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There was a concern that the Commissioner might want to assess duty on an
estimate of any increase in value.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would that be a concern of Estate Mortgage Managers or Mr Lew?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That would be a concern of whoever was paying the stamp duty.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Why would that be a concern of Estate Mortgage or Mr Lew?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because they were representing the entity that would have to pay the
stamp duty.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That would be a concern of the personal entity that they represent not
their own concern?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>

<P>

<i>As you will see from the contents of the Equity Sharing Agreement,
Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty Limited is one of the shareholders.  It

<P>

<b>Evidence given by Mr Peter Scanlan</b>
<P>

200   	Mr Scanlan had been a partner of Cleary &amp; Hoare since
1987.  He had completed his two year Articles in 1983 and 1984
and joined
Cleary &amp; Hoare in 1985.
<P>

201   	Mr Scanlan was unable to recall the precise number of
transactions in relation to which Cleary &amp; Hoare had received instructions
from EMM.  Between 1985 and 1990 to his recollection, there were approximately
20 to 30 such transactions and he was involved as
a solicitor or partner in all
of those transactions.  He had many dealings with Mr Reuben Lew and with Mr
Richard Lew in the course
of those transactions.  On his evidence, had more
dealings with Mr Richard Lew than with Mr Reuben Lew.  [T8-9]
<P>

202   	Mr Scanlan accepted that he understood the nature of the
obligations owed by a solicitor to his client, especially a client
who was a
lender and a trustee.  He accepted that he understood the nature of fiduciary
obligations owed by a solicitor to his client
and knew that those obligations
involved duties of good faith and honesty and of full disclosure and a duty not
to prefer the interest
of one client over the interest of another client.  He
was aware of all those matters in June 1990  [T 9]
<P>

203   	In about June 1990, Mr Scanlan learned of the
difficulties involving EMM and became aware that Messrs Richard and Reuben
Lew
were being investigated for possible criminal offences.  These events were
discussed by Mr Scanlan with his partners at the time.
 The discussions were
principally with Mr Cleary as he was then the managing partner.  [T 11]
<P>

204   	It is highly likely that Mr Scanlan read an article which
appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 8 June 1990 which
made plain
that the managers of Estate Mortgage Trusts were being investigated for
possible criminal offences.  It is likely that
he noticed from that article the
reference to Weltsbarrd and Yossarian Nominees which he likely immediately
recalled were companies
which had been involved in the transactions undertaken
on behalf of BPTC involving PMA companies in 1985 and 1986.
<P>

205   	The PMA transactions were at the time, the largest
transactions which Mr Scanlan had been involved in and to his recollection
particularly memorable transactions.  [T 11]
<P>

206   	On 19 June 1990, Mr Scanlan was examined at an NCSC
hearing and prior to this examination had spoken with Mr Geoffrey Chettle
of
counsel who was investigating the affairs of Estate Mortgage Managers Ltd and
who explained that the focus of NCSC attention at
the time was the Nordemesne
transactions and the PMA transactions.  [T 12]
<P>

207   	Prior to attending to be examined, Mr Scanlan, following
service upon him of a subpoena, informed Mr Lacey that the consequence
of
service of the subpoena was that he would be required to have access to and
possibly to produce the Nordemesne documents and the
PMA documents and this was
because he understood that the Nordemesne and PMA transactions were to be the
subject of enquiry in the
examination which he had been summonsed to attend.
It was only the Nordemesne and PMA transactions which he understood had been
singled
out to him for examination.
<P>

208   	During the course of the NCSC examination, Mr Scanlan was
represented by Mr Nolan, solicitor of Gilshenan &amp; Luton and
by Mr Morris of
counsel.  Prior to the examination, Mr Scanlan went to the trouble of ensuring
that Burns Philp was prepared to waive
privilege in relation to the production
of the PMA documents and this was because Mr Scanlan knew that they would be
necessary or
required for production in connection with the examination.  [T
19]
<P>

209   	Mr Scanlan accepted under cross-examination, that one of
the circumstances which was brought to his attention during the
NCSC
examination was that the PMA 1 and 2 transactions by which Mr Lew had an
interest through Weltsbarrd and Yossarian in the trust
funds advanced by Burns
Philp, represented an exception to the norm in relation to transactions which
took place.  [T19]  This was
something which was brought home to him during the
examination by reason of the questions put to him, as was the fact that he did
not know of any other transaction involving Mr Lew or any of the Lew companies
and funds advanced by the trust or the trustee.  [T
19]
<P>

210   	Another circumstance which Mr Scanlan accepted had been
brought to his attention during the NCSC examination on several occasions
was
that he, as the solicitor for Burns Philp Trustee Company, had a fiduciary
relationship to it involving duties of good faith
and honesty and full
disclosure.  He also accepted that it was pointed out to him during the
examination that even if there were
a reference in some documents to Weltsbarrd
or Yossarian, this would not tell the trustee that the Lews were involved in
the transaction.
 [T 20]
<P>

211   	Mr Scanlan recalled that an issue which had been
explained to him during the examination was as to whether, pursuant to his
fiduciary duty, it was incumbent upon him to alert the trustee to what was
happening.  He recalled an issue made plain to him during
the examination as to
whether it was part of his duty to alert the trustee that Mr Reuben Lew or the
Lew family had an interest in
the transaction.  [T 20]
<P>

212   	It was also brought to his attention during the
examination that the examiner did not understand how Mr Scanlan could assume,
as he informed the examiner he did, that the trustee knew about the Lew family
being involved in those loans.  [T 20]  That matter
was put to Mr Scanlan
forcefully.  [T 20]
<P>

213   	In the course of the examination it was brought to Mr
Scanlan's attention, as he accepted, that by the time he came to deal
with the
PMA 2 transaction he was aware that the Lew family had an interest in both PMA
1 and PMA 2.  This is what he stated during
the examination.
<P>

214   	One of the accusations levelled at him by Mr Chettle
during the NCSC examination was that he did not raise with the trustee,
the
interests which the Lew family had had in PMA 1 and PMA 2.
<P>

215   	Mr Scanlan's evidence was that he said during the NCSC
examination, that he presumed that the trustee knew of the involvement
of
Weltsbarrd and Yossarian in the transactions and that it had taken him by
complete surprise when Mr Chettle mentioned at that
time, an issue as to
whether the trustee had known of this involvement.
<P>

216   	The point made to Mr Scanlan at the NCSC examination was
that despite his assertion that he presumed that the trustee had
been aware, he
was not able to assist the examiner at that time as to how the trustee had
known.  Mr Scanlan accepted that during
the NCSC examination he kept saying to
Mr Chettle that Cleary &amp; Hoare had received instructions from the manager
and that he,
Mr Scanlan, had presumed that the trustee knew what the manager
was doing.  [T 21]
<P>

217   	Mr Scanlan recalled that at one stage during the
examination on 19 June, Mr Morris had objected on his behalf to certain
questions put to him.  Mr Scanlan accepted that in making those objections, Mr
Morris was seeking to protect Mr Scanlan from the
adverse consequences to the
line of questions.  Mr Scanlan presumed that the transcript of his evidence
could have been used against
him in civil proceedings.  [T 23]
<P>

218   	Mr Scanlan knew at the time that it was important to
avoid evidence which might have implications for any civil liability.
 [T
23]
<P>

219   	It was made clear to Mr Scanlan during the examination
that his personal involvement in the PMA transactions was the subject
of
enquiry, as was the Lew's involvement in those transactions.  The examiner made
clear that the Commission was investigating whether
Mr Scanlan may have been
involved in wrongful conduct in the PMA transactions.  [T 23]
<P>

220   	Mr Scanlan understood that the wrongful conduct being
investigated related to the way in which it came about that the Lews
had a 50
per cent financial interest in the PMA transactions and why he had taken no
steps to inform Burns Philp at the time.  [T24.5]
<P>

221   	Mr Scanlan recalled that the essence of the conduct which
was being investigated in relation to this part of the examination
was that
matter and that Mr Morris on his behalf, had objected on a number of occasions
to questions relating to or referring to
Mr Scanlan's fiduciary duty and duty
of care.  He accepted that the factual context in which those questions arose
related to the
failure on his part, whether it was justified or not, to notify
Burns Philp of the involvement of the Lews in the transactions. 
[T 24]  He
accepted that those duties, if breached, might give rise to a civil liability,
a matter which he knew at that time as
it was obvious, this being the very
reason why Mr Morris was keen to object to questions about those duties.  [T
24]
<P>

222   	Mr Scanlan accepted that what Mr Chettle put to him
during the examination as the essential question was why he, Mr Scanlan,
did
not tell Burns Philp about the involvement of the Lew family in the PMA
transactions.  Mr Scanlan accepted that his answer during
the examination on
that issue was that he had presumed that the trustee knew all about the
involvement of the Lew family in the PMA
transactions.  He accepted that if
that answer was not good enough or were not correct, it was quite obvious that
he may have breached
his duty as a solicitor to the trustee.  [T 24]
<P>

223   	When Mr Scanlan left the witness box on 19 June, it was
obvious to him that there was an unresolved issue as to whether he
could
satisfy the examiner that he had not breached his duty in not informing Burns
Philp of the above matter.
<P>

224   	At the end of the examination, Mr Chettle had stated that
he was not suggesting that Mr Scanlan had sat down and conspired
with the Lews
and that there was no reason to suspect the commission of a criminal offence.
[T 25]
<P>

225   	Mr Chettle had stated:
<P>

<i>`We have no reason to suspect that your client has committed criminal
offences.'  </i>[T 25.55]
<P>

226   	Mr Scanlan accepted that he knew, following the NCSC
examination, that `there was an unresolved question in the examiner's
mind
about whether there was a breach of duty, let alone a criminal offence'.  [T
27.45]
<P>

227   	Mr Scanlan accepted that he had been given an indication
of the possibility of a claim for breach of duty in relation to
the PMA
transactions during the NCSC examination.  [T 28.10]  He accepted at transcript
28 that Mr Chettle put to him the possibility
of a claim in relation to the PMA
transactions, relating to the possibility that there had been a breach of his
fiduciary duty in
failing to notify the trustee of the involvement of the Lews.
[T 28]
<P>

228   	Whilst Mr Scanlan's primary preoccupation during the NCSC
examination had been the possibility of a criminal offence, he
accepted that
the examination `made clear that the possibility of a breach of duty was also
in question'.  [T 28]
<P>

229   	On the afternoon following the examination, Mr Scanlan
was served with a further notice to produce books by the NCSC which
notice
specifically directed attention to the files he held in relation to the advance
by Burns Philp to PMA 1 and PMA 2 and any
further advances relating to them.
He informed his partners about the production of the files and in particular
informed Mr Cleary
of this matter.  He also discussed with Mr Nolan the
interrelationship between the files which were requested and the evidence which
he had given that day.
<P>

230   	Mr Scanlan accepted that he was keeping Mr Cleary closely
informed about the sequence of events in relation to his examination
because of
all the other partners, he was the one most closely concerned with the subject
matter of the investigation into the PMA
transactions.  [T 30]
<P>

231   	Mr Scanlan recalled that a few days after his
examination, Messrs Reuben and Richard Lew were arrested.  He recalled that
this caused concern amongst himself and his partners.  [T 31]
<P>

232   	On 22 June 1990, Cleary &amp; Hoare had written to Minet
International Professional Indemnity Limited enclosing a proposal
form for `top
up' cover for the period 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991.  Cleary &amp; Hoare
requested a quotation in the amount of $5
million $7.5 million and $10 million.
[DX Vol 6 p 15]
<P>

233   	Mr Scanlan accepted that it was likely that he told Mr
Cleary following his NCSC examination that there was a question as
to whether
he, Mr Scanlan, had breached his duty to the trustee, although he felt he could
justify his actions.  [T 33]
<P>

234   	It was possible although he could not recall for certain,
that he made plain to Mr Cleary that allegations of a breach of
fiduciary duty
would involve, if justified, a civil liability.  [T 33]
<P>

235   	Mr Scanlan was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . the discussion which you said was likely between the partnership
as to the need to increase the professional indemnity cover
in the light of the
unfolding events in relation to the Estate Mortgage Trust took place, did it
not, because of the possibility
of a civil claim arising from those events
which may be greater than the then current level of cover . . .</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would say its more than likely that was a matter that was in the mind
of certain partners and may have been addressed at a partners'
meeting.  I
simply can't recall . . .'  [T 34]</i>
<P>

236   	Following the examination on 19 June and the provision of
documents by Mr Scanlan pursuant to a notice to produce, Mr Nolan
retained on
Mr Scanlan's behalf, Mr Callinan QC.  Mr Nolan later reported to Mr Scanlan
that Mr Chettle, in speaking to Mr Nolan,
had said that he had looked at the
documents produced and regarded the matter as very serious for Mr Scanlan.  [T
36]
<P>

237   	On about 10 July, Mr Chettle had spoken to Mr Callinan
and said to Mr Callinan that both Mr Scanlan and Mr Cleary were under
suspicion, the clear implication being that they were under suspicion for
criminal offences.  [T 30]
<P>

238   	Mr Scanlan accepted that what was apparent to him as
early as 9 or 10 July was that the NCSC having looked at the further
documents
produced, was not satisfied that there was a sufficient reason why he had not
informed the trustee about the involvement
of the Lew family in the PMA
transactions.  [ T 37]  Hence the possibility of a claim which had arisen in
the course of the 19 June
NCSC examination had by that stage, on Mr Scanlan's
evidence, become more likely.
<P>

239   	Mr Scanlan was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	But you accept, do you not, that the possibility of civil liability
against the firm arose from the very same facts and circumstances
which formed
the basis of the allegations which you thought unjustified of criminal
misconduct . . . </i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

[T 37]
<P>

240   	Mr Scanlan recalled that Mr Cleary had been the person
within the firm who was personally responsible for arranging the firm's
insurance cover and Mr Scanlan understood that Mr Cleary was the only partner
who took that under his personal wing.  [T 38]
<P>

241   	Mr Scanlan's examination by the NCSC had resumed on 27
July, on which occasion Mr Fryberg QC appeared on his behalf.  Mr
Scanlan
recalled that at the commencement of the examination, Mr Fryberg expressed a
number of concerns to the delegate of the NCSC
who was presiding, including his
concerns about possible professional liability of the firm Cleary &amp; Hoare.
The point which Mr
Fryberg had explained of the concerns which he was
expressing, was that the questions should, as far as possible, not go beyond
the
narrow confines of the subject matter of the investigations set out in the
notice which Mr Scanlan had received.
<P>

242   	The transcript of the NCSC examination in this regard
includes, inter alia, the following:
<P>

<i>`Mr Fryberg . . . The only other preliminary matter that I wish to raise is
in relation to a number of press reports that have occurred
since the hearing
on the last occasion, in which a particular Melbourne lawyer has been quoted as
foreshadowing action, civil action,
against the trustee Burns Philp.  Burns
Philp, it would appear, are quite likely to make claims in turn against
auditors and perhaps
other professional people who may have been engaged by it.
That naturally is a matter of some concern to my clients . . . One particular
question or category of questions that is of concern in this regard, having
regard to the transcript of the proceedings on the last
occasion, are
</i><cite>questions directed towards showing the duty owed by the solicitors to
their client and the existence or otherwise of any breach of
that contractual
duty</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>These are matters which, as we would see it, are unlikely on any view to
fall within the matters of which notice was given this morning
and which in
fairness - perhaps not deliberately but which did seem to arise from time to
time on a previous occasion and which I
think perhaps were not intended to be
pressed on the previous occasion.  . . .'</i>
<P>

[DX volume 5 page 310 and 311]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

243   	Mr Scanlan accepted that he understood that Mr Fryberg
was there endeavouring to protect the firm Cleary &amp; Hoare against
any
adverse inference which may arise from answers given in the examination which
may result in the possibility of a claim of civil
liability against the firm.
[T 39]
<P>

244   	The 27th July resumption of Mr Scanlan's NCSC examination
was a Friday.  On the following Monday, Mr Cleary sought quotations
to increase
the firm's cover to $20 million, $30 million and $40 million respectively.  [T
39]
<P>

245   	Mr Cleary was examined also on 27 July in the afternoon
following Mr Scanlan's further examination that day.
<P>

246   	Mr Scanlan was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Did the two of you discuss, as far as was permissible, the substance of
the allegations against either of you individually or
against the firm?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe we sat down and discussed them, but our major relief was that
we were told that this would be the end of the matter and
that we would have to
be witnesses for the Crown, and we were pleased about that.'</i>
<P>

[T 39]
<P>

247   	On 6 August 1990, Gilshenan &amp; Luton wrote to Mr
Chettle seeking particulars of the charges which had by then been laid
against
Messrs Cleary &amp; Scanlan.  The particulars sought appear at DX volume 5 page
113 and following.
<P>

248   	The response to this request for further and better
particulars was supplied by the Victorian Corporate Affairs Commission
to
Messrs Gilshenan &amp; Luton under cover of letter of 14 August 1990.  [DX
volume 5 page 121]  This response set out many pages
of particulars and
included particulars of the essence of the prosecution allegations against Mr
Scanlan and against Mr Cleary in
separate paragraphs.  The paragraphs are
extremely similar in their wording to one another although not identical.  It
is sufficient
for present purposes to set out that which related to Mr Scanlan
at DX volume 5 page 128.  It read:
<P>

<i>`The essence of the prosecution allegation against Mr Scanlan is that he
aided and abetted, counselled and procured, the execution
of an Equity Sharing
Agreement and the transfer of one PMA share between Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty
Limited and PMA Development Company
No 1 Pty Limited, such agreement
constituting a secret commission to Reuben Lew or Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty
Limited.  Positive steps
were taken by Mr Scanlan to keep Burns Philp Trustee
Company ignorant of such agreement.  The documents were drawn in Queensland
and
sent to Victoria for execution.  Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty Limited was a
Victorian company and controlled by Mr Reuben Lew.  At
the same time Mr Lew was
associated with Estate Mortgage Managers Limited which company managed the
various Estate Mortgage Trusts
on behalf of Burns Philp Trustee Company
Limited.   . . .'</i>
<P>

249   	Mr Scanlan accepted under cross examination that the
underlying facts which were described in the particulars, dealing with
the
essence of the allegations, were the same underlying facts which, whether he
had thought were justified or not, had been the
subject of his evidence on 19
June.  [T 45]
<P>

250   	On 6 August 1990 an informal meeting of partners [those
attending being Mr Cleary, Mr Hoare, Ms King, Mr Scanlan, Mr Hart,
Mr Hewlett
and Ms Harrington] of Cleary &amp; Hoare was held.  Mr Hoare prepared the
minutes.  [DX 5 p 111(a)].
<P>

251   	The minutes cover a range of topics concerned with
`damage control' in relation to the charges and the effect of adverse
publicity
on the firm.  The minutes include, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`Co-ordination:  JH will head up the co-ordinating effort and strategy and
will act as a link between the rest of the partners and
Don and Peter.  The aim
is to take as much individual pressure off Peter and Don as possible.  John
will attend as many meetings
as possible with Peter and Don's solicitors and
barristers.</i>
<P>

<i>Press Publicity Defamation:  This is to be co-ordinated by Peter Hall
providing all material to Kelli Stallard with a copy to John
Hoare and Peter
Scanlan.  Kelli has instructions to institute proceedings in respect of the
Sunday Mail article and any other articles
she considers to be defamatory. . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>Legal Costs:  It was resolved that the firm meet Peter's and Don's legal
costs in relation to the matter on the basis that the allegations
be treated
properly as allegations against the firm and therefore a firm expense.  Peter
and Don are agreeable that in the event
of any monies being recovered through
defamation or other proceedings, then those monies will belong to the firm.   .
. .</i>
<P>

<i>Law Claims:  JH is to write a letter to Law Claims simply advising details
of the charges.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

252   	On 7 August 1990, Cleary &amp; Hoare wrote to the
Manager, Law Claims, Queensland Law Society Incorporated in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>`Re Donald James Cleary, Peter James Scanlan - Charges laid 1st August
1990</i>
<P>

<i>Please find enclosed detail of the charges laid against two partners of our
firm on the 1st August 1990.  The matters received widespread
press publicity.
To date, no details of any factual situations supporting those charges have
been supplied.  No allegations of negligence
have been raised against the firm
in relation to this matter.  We are simply advising you as a matter of courtesy
and will keep you
informed should there be any further developments whereby
negligence is alleged or implied.'</i>
<P>

[DX volume 6 page 48]
<P>

253   	Mr Scanlan accepted that the description of the events
forming the basis of the charges which were enclosed with this letter
to Law
Claims was `a description of the same underlying facts which were the subject
of [his] examination on 19 June'.  [T 45.55]
 Those were matters which he had
said gave rise to a question of a possible breach of duty by him in that
examination and a possible
civil liability against the firm.  He accepted that
those facts, namely the facts set out in the details of the charges against
him,
are substantially the same facts as later became the subject of the civil
proceedings which were commenced against the firm - it
was the same underlying
complaint.  The complaint was that Cleary and Hoare had not informed the
trustee about the investment of
the Lews in the PMA transactions.  It was
clear, he accepted, that the facts which were the subject of his examination on
19 June,
gave rise to the charges which were served on 1 August and that the
surrounding circumstances in due course gave rise to the subsequent
civil
proceedings against the firm.  In essence, he accepted that `the essential
underlying facts were the same whether they were
the subject of [his] 19 June
examination or the charges served on 1 August or the first writ which was
served'.  [T 46]
<P>

254   	Mr Scanlan accepted that between 14 and 28 November 1985,
he was involved in the PMA 1 transaction.  He accepted that during
that period
he acted, subject to Mr Cleary's supervision, as the solicitor for BPTC.  [T
46]
<P>

255   	Mr Scanlan accepted that it was necessary for him in that
role to address certain correspondence directly to the trustee
company and that
in directing correspondence directly to the trustee company he was obliged to
fulfil his fiduciary duty to that
company including his duties of honesty and
full disclosure.  He recalled that the instructions which had been given to his
firm
also required him, in relation to the PMA 1 transaction, to keep the
trustee fully informed on all matters incidental to the transaction
being an
express instruction, additional to any fiduciary duty which he had.  [T 47]
<P>

256   	Mr Scanlan accepted that the transaction, namely the PMA
1 transaction, involved two elements, namely a Loan Agreement and
an Equity
Sharing Agreement.  Taken as a whole, those two elements and the documents in
relation to those elements, constituted the
PMA 1 transaction documents.  He
drafted certain collateral securities in support of the Equity Sharing
Agreement and made at least
one alteration to the recitals on the Equity
Sharing Agreement.  [T 47-48]
<P>

257   	Mr Scanlan accepted that he would have reviewed the
Equity Sharing Agreement and that he noticed that the parties to it were
PMA
companies on the one hand and Weltsbarrd on the other hand.  He accepted that
he did not act for the PMA companies but he had
acted for the Weltsbarrd
company.  He accepted that he knew that the persons who stood behind the PMA
companies were different from
the persons who stood behind Weltsbarrd although
his evidence was that he had not known who was behind Weltsbarrd.  [T48]
<P>

258   	Mr Scanlan had known that Mr Remo and Mr Bentley were the
individuals who stood behind the PMA group of companies.
<P>

259   	Mr Scanlan was taken to recital `H' of the Equity Sharing
Agreement.  His recollection was vague as to precisely what he
had and had not
seen.  It was necessary for him to draft documents which were related to the
Equity Sharing Agreement and he accepted
that he had to have some minimum
understanding of the operation of that agreement in order to draft those
documents.  To the extent
that his evidence was that he just drafted precedents
and did not have a basic understanding of the way in which the Equity Sharing
Agreement operated, that evidence is rejected.  It should be recalled that he
was asked and answered as follows at page 51:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You could not fulfil, safely, your obligations in relation to the
further documentation which you were required to draft for the
further advance
which occurred on 28 November, without having an understanding of the necessary
operative terms of the Equity Sharing
Agreement could you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would be difficult.'</i>
<P>

[T 51]
<P>

260   	At transcript 51, Mr Scanlan accepted that in the PMA 1
transaction taken as a whole, he had acted for the trustee company
and for
Weltsbarrd.  Between 14 and 28 November he had known that the persons who stood
behind the PMA companies, Mr Remo and Mr
Bentley, were different from the
person or persons who stood behind Weltsbarrd.  He knew that his instructions
from Weltsbarrd came
from Estate Mortgage Managers.  He was aware of no one who
stood behind Weltsbarrd other than those who gave him instructions in
relation
to it.  There was no one he could point to in the period when he was acting in
the PMA 1 transaction, from whom he got instructions
in relation to Weltsbarrd,
other than Messrs Reuben or Richard Lew.  [T 51]
<P>

261   	As to the letter of 27 November 1985, from Cleary &amp;
Hoare to BPTC in its original form, Mr Scanlan accepted [at transcript
52] that
the letter had his initials located after the initials DJC within the reference
and that it was more than likely that he
had something to do with the drafting
of the letter.  He must have had some involvement in the drafting of the letter
as his initials
were on the letter.  His evidence was that the Court could
reliably proceed on the basis that the letter was either written by him
or part
of it was written by him.  He accepted that when he wrote the letter or wrote
part of it, he did so `knowing that the letter
was intended to be relied on by
the trustee'.  [T 52.55]
<P>

262   	At transcript 53, he accepted that the way in which the
practice operated was that he would have seen the letter before it
was signed.
He was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And the letter was written in so far as it was written by you
deliberately, intentionally, not inadvertently?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The letter would have been written to, to, it would have been
deliberately written to achieve the end result of a settlement.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the end result which the letter was written to achieve was that it be
relied upon by the trustee before advancing moneys to
the borrower?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the letter which you either wrote or cooperated in writing, referred
to certain facts and documents, a series of them, which
you thought at that
time it was appropriate to inform the trustee about?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you thought it appropriate to refer to those facts and documents in
the sense that you thought all of that information was
relevant information
which you were required to provide to the trustee in the fulfilment of your
duty?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The letter was intended to be furnished to the trustee in the fulfilment
of that very duty wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In fulfilment of your fiduciary duty to act with honesty and full
disclosure towards the trustee?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And in fulfilment of your expressed contractual requirement to keep the
trustee fully informed on all the matters incidental to
the transaction?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.'</i>
<P>

[T 53]
<P>

263   	Mr Scanlan was closely cross-examined in relation to the
message of a telephone call from Mr Lew seeking to speak to him
at 8.32 am on
28 November and to the following events including his telephone discussion with
Mr Lew and the redrafted letter sent
out by facsimile at 9.20am on the same
morning.
<P>

264   	In being shown his handwritten note of the telephone
conversation with Mr Lew, his evidence was that he could recall Mr Lew
`requesting that the material be separated'.  [T 54]
<P>

265   	He was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Well, whether you recall it or not, it is reasonable to conclude, is it
not, that one thing he did say to you was that there was
to be no reference to
the Equity Sharing Agreement in Burns Philp Trustee Company
correspondence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's what, yes, it says.  "No reference to Equity Share in BP
correspondence".'</i>
<P>

[T 54]
<P>

266   	As far as Mr Scanlan could recall, it was more than
likely that the conversation was with Mr Reuben Lew.  
<P>

267   	He believed that after his conversation with Mr Reuben
Lew, he would have spoken with Mr Cleary and probably would have said:
 "Mr Lew
rang up, and this is what he said"  [T 55],  no doubt repeating what Mr Lew had
in fact said or the substance of what he
had said.
<P>

268   	Mr Scanlan accepted that following the conversation with
Mr Lew and his further conversation with Mr Cleary, it is likely
that he wrote
the letter of 28 November 1985, sent under cover of the facsimile sheet at
9.20am on that day.  [T 56]
<P>

269   	He accepted that he recorded on a copy of the 27 November
1985 letter on his file, the words `further certificate done on
28 November'
and that this followed the conversation with Mr Lew and that Mr Lew had, in
effect said to him `change the letter'.
 [T 56]
<P>

270   	He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Mr Lew said to you, in effect, "change the letter" didn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes he did.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you had sent the first letter to him?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that is normally the procedure.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>So it was obvious that the letter was not going to be sent to
the trustee company until you changed it?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That's possible, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

[T 56]
<P>

271   	Mr Scanlan believed that Mr Lew had phoned wanting the
correspondence to be changed and Mr Scanlan's evidence was that he
did not
think that there was anything wrong with this.  [T 57]
<P>

272   	Mr Scanlan also accepted that the letter of 28 November
was written intentionally and deliberately and that there was nothing
accidental about the content of the letter and that it was a considered letter
which he intended the trustee to rely upon.  He was
asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	</i><cite>You deleted, in this letter, reference to the encumbrance over
the land in favour of Weltsbarrd, didn't you?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, because that is what Mr Lew asked me to
do</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And you deleted reference to the Equity Sharing Agreement,
didn't you?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And by doing so, in your capacity as a solicitor acting for the trustee
company, you chose not to tell the trustee of certain facts
and documents which
the previous day you had considered appropriate to inform it about?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct, because Mr Lew had given us instructions and I relied on
the client's instructions.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>So you knew what you were doing?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[T 57]
<P>

273   	At transcript 58, Mr Scanlan was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . The letter of 28 November concealed certain information which was
in the letter of 27 November, didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that was your choice, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	What do you mean my "choice"?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You chose to do that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Me, personally.  I don't know if Mr Cleary did it or I did it . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Scanlan what you did was choose to follow the instructions of Mr Lew,
rather than perform your duty to the trustee in the way
which you had
originally proposed to do so, didn't you? . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	A.	Yes, I followed Mr Lew's instructions.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that was a conscious and deliberate decision which you made?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can't say it was me who made that decision.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was a decision, whether you personally made it or not, in which you
participated?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I would have assisted in preparing the letters for the transaction
that afternoon.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you participated in that decision knowing precisely what you were
doing, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was following Mr Lew's instructions, that is what I was doing.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And you knew that the consequence of following those
instructions was that you were failing to disclose information which you had
previously thought you should reveal in the performance of your duty to the
trustee?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . </i><cite>I didn't think about it</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[T 59]
<P>

274   	Mr Scanlan was closely cross-examined on the material
which was missing from the 28 November 1985 letter written to BPTC
as opposed
to the form of letter which had originally been drafted for submission to BPTC
of 27 November 1985.  The letter which
had finally been sent, omitted the
references to Cleary &amp; Hoare having prepared the Bill of Encumbrance
(Equity Sharing Agreement).
 As has been already noted, in each case, the
letter began :
<P>

<i>`We certify that we have prepared the following additional documents in
connection with the borrower's purchase of the final properties
comprising the
total development site at Southport . . .'</i>
<P>

275   	The cross-examination of Mr Scanlan at transcript 60,
includes the following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	The letter said, in the second paragraph, that "we" that is Cleary &amp;
Hoare . . . "have prepared the following additional documents
in connection
with the borrower's purchase of the final properties", doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Then it lists two documents or categories of documents doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The bill of encumbrance, collateral to equity sharing agreement to which
you referred in your letter of 27 November, was prepared
by your firm, to use
the words of the letter, "in connection with the borrower's purchase of the
final properties", wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, you could say that, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That bill of encumbrance encumbered the final properties, the purchase of
which were settled on 28 November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The second part yes, there was a settlement on the 14th and one on the
28th.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that bill of encumbrance to which you did not refer in the letter of
28 November, encumbered the land in support of the obligations
owed to
Weltsbarrd under the equity sharing agreement, didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If there had not been the purchase of the final property referred to in
this letter, there would have been no need for the bill
of encumbrance, in
support of the equity sharing agreement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The bill of encumbrance in support of the equity sharing agreement was
prepared in connection with the purchase of those final
properties, wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I suppose you could say that, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So the statement in the second paragraph of the letter of 28 November in
so far as it said:</i>
<P>

<i>"We have prepared the following additional documents in connection with the
borrower's purchase of the final property"</i>
<P>

<cite>is a half truth, isn't it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>If you look at it that way, I suppose it is</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is the only way of looking at it, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It doesn't list all of the relevant securities but, as I've said, we had
instructions from Estate Mortgage to take it out.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is the only way of looking at it, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, yes,</i><cite> it doesn't fully detail all of the
securities</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>There is no doubt that it is a half truth, isn't
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, I suppose you look at it that way</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>It does not give the reader of the letter the whole
picture</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Not for all the securities</cite><i>, but it does for Burns
Philp.  It lists all the securities that were taken.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	My question was capable of a simple answer, </i><cite>it does not give
the reader of the letter the whole picture, does it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, it doesn't</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You knew the whole picture, didn't you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You intended the trustee to rely on the
letter</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, to draw the funds down</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>The letter gave a false picture to the trustee, didn't
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It doesn't give a complete picture of the securities
taken</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>The letter gave a false picture to the trustee, didn't
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And that false picture was deliberate, wasn't
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It wasn't, I had instructions to do it .</cite><i> . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I'm sure you now regret having written the letter in the form it was
despatched, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In light of what has happened in my life, probably, yeah.'</i>
<P>

[T 60-61]
<P>

276   	Generally, Mr Scanlan maintained his assertion that at
all times he believed he was acting on the instructions of Burns Philp
Trustee
Company Limited, given to him by the managers on behalf of Burns Philp.
<P>

277   	Mr Scanlan was cross-examined on the diary note in his
handwriting of 14 November 1985, written on the day when settlement
of the
transaction took place.  His evidence was that this diary note really set out a
check list for the settlement.  He was cross-examined
on the item which had the
words `equity sharing!!'.  As already stated, the arrow pointing to that item
is preceded by `P7'.  It
was put to Mr Scanlan that the reference to P7 was a
reference to the Deed of Loan and to page 7 of that Deed of Loan.  It was
suggested
that when he looked at that page, he noticed that there was a
reference there to an Equity Sharing Agreement and then made the note
on the
settlement sheet.  His belief was that the P7 might have referred to the Equity
Sharing Agreement and to the fact that someone
had to include a dollar figure
on page 7 of that agreement at settlement.  He referred to the fact that he
used exclamation marks
also on item 1 where referring to Form 61 and referred
to these marks as `doodle marks'.  They did not, he said, mean anything. 
[T
64-65]
<P>

278   	Mr Scanlan was asked questions in relation to the letter
of 23 January 1986 addressed to the Gold Coast City Council.  That
letter, he
accepted, was signed by him.  He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You were writing there on behalf of and instructed by Weltsbarrd aren't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You have been, had pains in your statement, to suggest that you did not
have an understanding of who your client was, your client
Weltsbarrd, haven't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There is reference in my statement to the fact about when I became aware
of who, or what was behind Weltsbarrd, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is clear that on 28 January 1986 you were writing letters on behalf
[sic] the company weren't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	To perfect their security.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You don't suggest, you didn't know who it was on behalf of the company
for whom you were acting?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I simply cannot recall when I knew who, or what was behind Weltsbarrd.
I've said that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You must have known, at least when you wrote this letter, mustn't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not necessarily.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you often write letters on behalf of companies and have no idea who is
instructing you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Mr Cleary had instructions from the client</cite><i>.  So we
would prepare the documents.  My job was to register them, at the stamp office
and get the Gold Coast City Council to put
them on the rate records and for me
to register them on the title.  That was what my role was.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You have no doubt that Mr Cleary, who was your principal, knew who his
client was?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	You will have to ask Mr Cleary . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Cleary asked you to take over and do certain things on the file didn't
he?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, he did.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Some of those things required you carrying out work and instructions for
Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You knew Mr Cleary had been involved in the original taking of
instructions on behalf of Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You had no doubt in your mind in November 1985 that Mr Cleary
knew who it was who was his client at Weltsbarrd</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That's a fair assumption</cite><i>.  I presume, you know he
received instructions and I was told to go and register the securities and
stamp them.  I didn't sit and
ask him about it all.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you said that's a fair assumption, were you giving an affirmative
answer to my question? . . .</i>
<P>

<i>The question was then repeated and Mr Scanlan answered:</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I simply can't recall what I discussed with Mr Cleary at the time about
it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>When I asked you that question, you said that's a fair
assumption.  Do you recall that answer</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Was that answer an affirmative response to my
question</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>You could probably say, yes</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[T 67-68]
<P>

279   	Mr Scanlan's evidence was cross-examined as to the date
15 November 1985 when the letter was written with his reference addressed
to
the Commissioner of Stamp Duties and was written on behalf of Weltsbarrd, and
as to whether there was any doubt as to his knowledge
of who the client was.
The evidence was :
<P>

<i>`Q.	There was no doubt that you knew who the client was on whose behalf you
were writing is there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I knew I was writing on behalf of Weltsbarrd.  </i><cite>I didn't know
who, or what was behind Weltsbarrd at that time</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You weren't in the habit of writing letters on behalf of corporate
clients without knowing who stood behind those corporate clients
were
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not really but I mean, I can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That would be a most unusual circumstance for any solicitor wouldn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I thought Mr Cleary had done this sort of stuff.  He asked me to stamp
and register documents.  I am a first year lawyer.  He tells
me to do it.  I do
it.  I didn't sit and enquire about it.'</i>
<P>

[T 68]
<P>

280   	Mr Scanlan accepted that by the time he became involved
in the preparation of the further advance which was settled on 28
November, he
was in a position to understand in a fundamental way the operation of the Deed
of Loan and the Equity Share Agreement.
 [T 78]
<P>

281   	Mr Scanlan was asked at transcript 78:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Mr Scanlan, what I wished to suggest to you is that knowing, as you must
have known, the essential terms of the Deed of Loan and
the Equity Sharing
Agreement, its just not reasonably possible that you could have failed to
understand a way in which the Equity
Sharing Agreement worked, at least in
broad terms?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I suppose that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And therefore it's not reasonable to say that on the basis of the
documents which you reviewed, you had no understanding of the
involvement of
Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I knew Weltsbarrd was involved and they were taking securities
in an Equity Sharing Agreement and mortgages</cite><i>, whatever.'</i>
<P>

[T 78]
<P>

282   	Mr Scanlan gave evidence that he knew Weltsbarrd was
involved and that it was taking securities in an Equity Sharing Agreement.
 His
understanding was that there was moneys to be advanced by Weltsbarrd.  [T
79]
<P>

<b>Evidence given by Mr Donald Cleary</b>
<P>

283   	Mr Cleary had been a partner in a Townsville firm of
solicitors between 1969 and 1981 and had founded the firm Cleary &amp;
Hoare in
Brisbane in 1981.  By 1985 the firm, as has already been mentioned, had three
partners.  Between 1985 and 1990 the firm
increased from the position where it
had three partners and four employed solicitors to the position where it had in
the order of
eleven partners and seventeen employed solicitors.
<P>

284   	Mr Cleary accepted that during the period between 1985 to
1990 there were something in the order of 40 to 50 transactions
which Cleary
&amp; Hoare carried out on behalf of the Estate Mortgage Group.  He had
personally sought the work of the Estate Mortgage
Group in 1985.  Mr Priddle,
who was a consultant to Cleary &amp; Hoare had spoken to Mr Cleary on a number
of occasions about acquiring
the larger financing work from the Estate Mortgage
Group, which work in 1985 had previously been carried out generally by Sydney
and Melbourne firms.  It was attractive for Mr Cleary to try to obtain that
work for his firm in Brisbane and as a consequence of
Mr Priddle's having
informed him about this as larger financing work, Mr Cleary came to speak to Mr
Reuben Lew or to write to him.
 The contact was made for the purpose of
introducing himself and offering the services of Cleary &amp; Hoare.  Mr Lew
shortly thereafter
furnished instructions to Cleary &amp; Hoare.  Mr Cleary
hoped and anticipated that those instructions would increase in number.
<P>

285   	The very first instruction to Cleary &amp; Hoare related
to the Sandy Bay transaction and the second instruction was the
PMA 1
transaction.  A number of transactions followed those initial transactions.
<P>

286   	Mr Cleary believed that if his firm had carried out a
`good job' on the first transaction, Cleary &amp; Hoare would, he anticipated
and hoped, receive more instructions.
<P>

287   	Mr Cleary accepted under cross-examination that the first
PMA 1 transaction was a particularly large transaction involving
approximately
$20 million.  It was clear to him that the Burns Philp Trustee Company was
Cleary &amp; Hoare's client and he accepted
that it was clear to him that he,
as solicitor for the BPTC owed a duty to it in the performance of his role as
its solicitor.
<P>

288   	Mr Cleary accepted that his duty included a fiduciary
duty, meaning a duty of honesty and of full disclosure and to avoid
a conflict
of interest and not to prefer the interests of one client over the interests of
another client.
<P>

289   	Mr Cleary accepted that his duty in relation to the PMA 1
transaction was encapsulated in a letter of instructions given
to him by
EMM.
<P>

290   	Mr Cleary accepted that at the time of the PMA 1
transaction, the letter of instruction imposed certain duties on Cleary
&amp;
Hoare by its express terms.
<P>

291   	Mr Cleary's evidence was that he did not know at the time
of the PMA 1 transaction that Reuben Lew was in effective practical
control or
involved with Weltsbarrd.  His evidence was that he did not know at the time of
the PMA 2 transaction that Reuben Lew
was in effective practical control of or
involved with Yossarian.
<P>

292   	His further evidence was that because he was not aware of
the involvement of Mr Lew at the time of the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions,
he
did not know that Mr Reuben Lew could obtain a substantial economic benefit
from those transactions.
<P>

293   	Mr Cleary accepted under cross-examination that it
followed that if Mr Reuben Lew was in effective control of Weltsbarrd
and
Yossarian then he, Mr Cleary, would have recognised that Mr Reuben Lew could
obtain a substantial economic benefit from those
transactions.  He was asked
and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	If you did know of Mr Lew's financial interest, I take it that you would
accept that it would have been your duty to ensure that
the trustee was fully
informed and consented to Mr Lew's financial involvement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If you did know of Mr Lew's involvement, may I take it you also accept it
would have been improper for you to conceal that fact
from the trustee?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It would have been, if you had that knowledge, dishonest to knowingly
conceal that fact from the trustee?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

[T 123-124]
<P>

294   	Mr Cleary was taken to the letter of 22 October 1985 from
EMM to PMA 1.  He accepted that this was the approval letter which
the manager
gave to the proposed borrower and in which an offer of loan on conditions was
made.  He accepted that he was shown this
letter on or about 24 October 1985
and that it contained certain information in relation to the proposed
transaction.  He accepted
also that the information in this letter was later
superseded by the letter of instructions dated 31 October 1985.
<P>

295   	Mr Cleary accepted that the letter dated 31 October 1985
contained the final instructions to Cleary &amp; Hoare prior to
the ultimate
settlement of the transaction on 14 November.  As already noted, he described
these as `the official instructions'.
 [T 129]
<P>

296   	Mr Cleary was confident that he had read the 22 October
1985 letter from EMM to PMA 1 when it was provided to him.  He was
reasonably
satisfied that he was at the time acquainted with the fact that the letter
recorded that Cleary &amp; Hoare would approve
not only the title of the
property over which the mortgage was to be given but also all matters which, in
the solicitors' opinion,
were incidental to the giving to the trustee of an
adequate and proper security.
<P>

297   	Although the letter of 22 October 1985 was addressed to
the borrower, paragraph 8 of the letter in setting out the terms
of the
solicitors' approval which was required, was accepted by Mr Cleary at the time
as recording the instructions to Cleary &amp;
Hoare in relation to its
obligation to approve the transaction.  [T 129]
<P>

298   	Mr Cleary also accepted that it was made plain in that
instruction that Cleary &amp; Hoare's obligations included ensuring
compliance
with the terms of the application for the loan advance - see paragraph 8.
<P>

299   	Mr Cleary's evidence in relation to the paragraph
numbered 18, entitled `Valuation Qualification Requisitions' was that he
may
have understood, because of the size of the proposed loan, that there may be
some syndication of it.  His evidence was that he
was not familiar with
syndicated loans but he knew that the syndication of a loan involved normally
the assignment of a fraction
of a mortgage to someone who would participate in
the loan advance.  He accepted that syndication involved some participation by
another party with the lender and that the participants in the syndicate would
jointly be the lenders to the borrower, each for their
part to have security
for their syndicated share of the loan advance.  Whether or not it would be by
mortgage, each of the participants
would, he accepted, have some form of
security for the amount of the loan advance in which they participated.  This
was not something
new to him as a concept.  He had had prior experience of a
syndicated loan transaction with Estate Mortgage Manage Managers before
PMA 1
as there had been a syndicated loan in the initial transaction handled by
Cleary &amp; Hoare.  Mr Cleary accepted that a syndicated
loan was simply
another way of referring to equity participation in the loan and his evidence
was that the phrase `equity participation
arrangements' in paragraph 18 of the
22 October 1985 letter to PMA 1, could refer to the syndication of the loan.
<P>

300   	Mr Cleary was shown a document which became part of
Exhibit DX 5, being a facsimile dated 31 July 1985 from EMM to Cleary
&amp;
Hoare, marked to Mr Don Cleary's attention.  The document enclosed as part of
this facsimile, was described as `the form of
agreement we use when assigning
either part or the whole of a mortgage'.  That document was a draft form of
Deed of Assignment.
<P>

301   	It was put to Mr Cleary that the Loan Syndication
Agreement enclosed with the facsimile was a relatively common form for
the
assignment by the first mortgagee to another lender or lender described as the
assignee.  Mr Cleary could not recall the facsimile
nor the document.  He could
not agree that that form of assignment in relation to a proposed syndicated
loan was a form with which
he was familiar in late October 1985.  Although the
document was addressed to `Don Cleary' and although there was no other `Don'
in
the firm besides himself, he insisted in giving evidence under
cross-examination that he had not seen the document before or could
not recall
seeing it before.  Being asked:
<P>

<i>`Do you have any doubt that the document was sent to you in May 1985 by
Estate Mortgage Managers?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.  There is no evidence of receipt on it, I have no
independent recollection of it, there appears to be no evidence
of receipt on
it . . .'.</i>
<P>

He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Is your position Mr Cleary that because you have not looked at this
document, unlike many others that you have looked at in preparation
for this
case, you are not prepared to admit you received it . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.'</i>
<P>

[T 132-133]
<P>

302   	As to the letter from EMM to BPTC of 23 October 1985, Mr
Cleary accepted that the handwritten alteration of the detail given
as to Mr
John Norman Potter to become `David John Bartley' was in his handwriting.  His
recollection was that this document was received
by him sometime after 24
October 1985.
<P>

303   	He believed that it was likely that he read this document
when he received it.
<P>

304   	It came as no surprise for Mr Cleary to see that the
financial information about the shareholders were set out in the 23
October
1985 letter from EMM to BPTC.  He accepted that it would be important to Burns
Philp as the financial information was relevant
to the taking of guarantees
from the shareholders.  [T 135]
<P>

305   	Mr Cleary was involved, as he accepted, in relation to
the preparation of guarantees and he accepted that he had known that
the
guarantees were being required from the persons who appeared to stand behind
PMA 1.  He accepted that it was normally the case
that shareholders of the
company borrower would normally be the guarantors.
<P>

306   	As to the letter of 23 October 1985 from EMM to BPTC, Mr
Cleary could not recall whether he had seen this document with the
typewritten
correction now giving Mr David John Bentley's personal details.
<P>

307   	In relation to his own handwritten notes taken on 24
October 1985, Mr Cleary was asked about the words `background for Bentley'.
All that he could recall was that this meant that some background for Bentley
was necessary.  In being asked whether it was obvious
that he was conscious
that Mr Bentley was being substituted for Mr Potter as a Director/Shareholder
and Guarantor of the company,
he answered that he had no recollection of that
matter but that the documents to which he was shown, appeared to indicate this
to
have been the case.  Although Mr Cleary could not recall or accept that the
reason that he wrote the words `background for Bentley'
was associated with the
need for the obtaining of a guarantee for Mr Bentley, he could not suggest what
other purpose his note might
have been written for.  [T 137]
<P>

308   	In relation to the 24 October 1985 meeting which he had
attended, Mr Cleary recalled that Mr Hilmer had said to him that
Mr Hilmer
required the profit sharing or equity sharing agreement to be prepared first
and to be approved before the rest of the
deal proceeded.  [T 137]
<P>

309   	Further in relation to the same meeting, Mr Cleary gave
the following evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	</i><cite>It was stressed that the Equity Sharing Agreement was matter
of great significance to them</cite><i> [meaning Mr Reuben Lew and Mr Richard
Lew and representatives of the PMA companies]?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was a priority in terms of time that that be resolved first.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The terms of the Equity Sharing Agreement explained to you involved the
share to be given to another party of the profit which
the borrower hoped to
make from the transaction?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As I understood it, another party would be contributing funds and that
that party would, in </i><cite>addition to interest</cite><i>, receive the
benefit of any increase in value of the property over a certain figure.'</i>
<P>

[T 138]
<P>

310   	In relation to the letter of 25 October 1985 from Cleary
&amp; Hoare to EMM, Mr Cleary accepted that this was written on
the day after
the meeting and that on that day he was able to furnish to Mr Reuben Lew, a
draft of the Equity Sharing Agreement.
 That draft recorded the instructions
which he had been given at that time in relation to the operation of the Equity
Sharing Agreement,
being instructions as varied by Mr Hilmer.  [T 139]
<P>

311   	Over the next several days, Mr Cleary recalled that he
was given instructions which enabled him to prepare a draft agreement
which in
due course became clause 7 of the Equity Sharing Agreement and included clause
7.01 of the Equity Sharing Agreement.
<P>

312   	As to the letter of 11 November 1985 to the solicitors
for PMA 1, Mr Cleary accepted that he had enumerated detail of the
enclosed
documents in the letter.  He accepted that the documents enclosed under cover
of the letter were in categories, the first
being the Deed of Loan and security
documents related to it and the second being the Equity Sharing Agreement and
collateral documents
securing obligations under that Equity Sharing
Agreement.
<P>

313   	Subject to the input which Mr Lew and Mr Hilmer had had
in relation to the drafting of the Equity Sharing Agreement, Mr Cleary
accepted
that he was the author of that document in the form as at the date it was
executed.  [T 140]  He was the creator of its
provisions and its layout and he
provided that the shareholders would be the two companies named in the recitals
appearing on the
second page of the document and he knew that those
shareholders were not the same shareholders as the original shareholders of PMA
1.  He knew at the outset that the shareholders of PMA 1 were Mr Remo and Mr
Bentley and the document provided, as he said, that
one of the purposes of the
Equity Sharing Agreement was to move the shares held by Mr Remo and Mr Bentley
to PMA Property Corporation
and to Weltsbarrd.
<P>

314   	Mr Cleary accepted that he was not confused about what he
drafted in the Equity Sharing Agreement and that he knew that the
steps were
that Mr Remo's share should be transferred to one of the incoming shareholders
and that Mr Bentley's share would be transferred
to the other incoming
shareholder and that the second shareholder, as referred to in the Equity
Sharing Agreement, was represented
by <u>him</u>.
<P>

315   	Mr Cleary accepted that part and parcel of the agreement
was that the obligations under clause 7 to account to Weltsbarrd
for the
profit, were to be secured by an encumbrance over the land.
<P>

316   	Mr Cleary also accepted that the letter of 11 November
1985 to Rylands &amp; Hilmer recorded that Mr Cleary had drafted and
sent out a
Bill of Encumbrance which was in effect a second mortgage, securing the
obligations in favour of Weltsbarrd under clause
7 of the Equity Sharing
Agreement.
<P>

317   	Generally, Mr Cleary accepted that Mr Hilmer had acted
for the PMA group of companies, namely PMA 1, PMA 2, PMA Property
Corporation
and some others.
<P>

318   	Mr Cleary accepted that the effect of the Equity Sharing
Agreement was to produce a second mortgage over the land.  Another
effect of
the Equity Sharing Agreement which he accepted, was that it necessitated a
change in the shareholders of PMA 1 from those
shareholders who were named in
the 23 October letter.
<P>

319   	Mr Cleary accepted that he was aware of the special
conditions attaching to the loan which required that there was not to
be any
further encumbrance of the land without the written consent of the trustee and
that he was also aware of the special condition
attaching to the loan which
required that there be no change in the shareholders of the borrower company
and that he was aware that
the effect of the Equity Sharing Agreement was that
there was a further encumbrance over the land and that there was a change in
the shareholders of the borrower company.
<P>

320   	Mr Cleary accepted that he did not inform the trustee
himself of those particular variations from the requirements of the
special
condition.  His evidence was that Estate Mortgage had varied his instructions
and that Mr Reuben Lew was the principal spokesman
for Estate Mortgage.  [T
145]
<P>

321   	His evidence was:
<P>

<i>`Q.	So you did not inform the trustee because Mr Lew, you say, varied your
instructions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because Estate Mortgage varied my instructions, instructions from Estate
Mortgage are regarded as instructions from Burns Philp.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And do you say that anyone other than Mr Reuben Lew was the author of
those varied instructions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.  I can't recall, they could have been.  It could have been
Reuben Lew, it could have been other people, but I can't
recall.  </i><cite>But
predominantly the instructions came from Reuben Lew</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[T 145]
<P>

322   	Mr Cleary accepted that it was normal practice to ensure
that the persons instructed in the borrower provide guarantees of
the loan
advance.  His evidence was as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And its that commercial consideration relating to the requirement for
guarantees from interested persons that lies behind the
condition prohibiting a
change in shareholders without the prior consent of the trustee isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Because no lender would like a situation to arise where having obtained
guarantees from certain nominated shareholders, those shareholders
ceased to be
interested in the company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Nor would it like a situation to arise where new shareholders come into
the company without providing guarantees to support the
loan?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The effect of the Equity Sharing Agreement was to introduce a new
shareholder of PMA wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In fact it introduced two new shareholders of PMA 1?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You obtained guarantees from all of the persons who stood behind the
first shareholder?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Including related companies of the first shareholder?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You did not obtain guarantees from the persons who stood behind
the second shareholder did you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You did not inform the trustee of that fact did
you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i> . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And I'm sure you recognised that the absence of guarantees from a
shareholder in the borrower company would be a matter of interest
to the
lender?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't consider that matter because that shareholder was advancing
funds . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 148]
<P>

323   	Mr Cleary's evidence was that he had no reason to suspect
that at the time of the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions between November
1985 and
October 1986, Mr Reuben Lew was in effective practical control or involved with
Weltsbarrd or Yossarian.  His evidence was
that if he did know of Mr Lew's
financial involvement, it would have been improper and dishonest to conceal his
knowledge from the
trustee.  His evidence was that if he did have reason to
suspect Mr Lew's financial involvement, it would have been improper and
dishonest to fail to disclose his suspicions to the trustee.
<P>

324   	Mr Cleary accepted that the letter dated 31 October 1985,
which he referred to as `the official instructions', related to
only one part
of the overall transactions.
<P>

325   	Mr Cleary's evidence was: 
<P>

<i>`Your evidence . . . is that you had no knowledge or any reason to suspect
Mr Reuben Lew was in effective, practical control or involved
with
Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If you did have that knowledge or that reason to suspect, it would have
been improper, I take it, to act on those variations to
your instructions
without ensuring that the trustee was fully aware and consented to them?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would have wanted to ensure that the trustee was aware of and
consented to the variations to the special conditions about further
encumbrances if you had that knowledge or reason to suspect?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes - you are asking me a hypothetical question now.  At the time I
wouldn't have considered that because I had no suspicions.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You told his Honour what your evidence about your knowledge at the time
was.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If you had that knowledge or reason to suspect you would have wanted to
ensure that the trustee consented to and was aware of the
change to the special
condition prohibiting changes in shareholders in the borrower company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>. . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If you did have that knowledge or reason to suspect, you would have
wanted to ensure that the trustee was fully apprised of the
terms of the equity
sharing agreement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would have made sure it was provided with a copy of that
document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>That is because Reuben Lew, through his interest in Weltsbarrd,
would effectively be the recipient of the benefit of those varied
instructions,
as well as the author of them?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>He would have an obvious conflict of interest, wouldn't
he?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I would have thought so.</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>If you had that knowledge or reason to suspect Mr Lew's
financial involvement, you could not be sure that Mr Lew having the benefit
of
those varied instructions, would pass on the information to the
trustee?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>If you did have that knowledge or suspicion, the absence of
formal written instructions about the equity sharing agreement and the
reference to it as a side agreement would have confirmed in your mind that you
could not be sure Mr Lew would pass on the information
to the
trustee?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[T 156-157]
<P>

326   	Mr Cleary's evidence was that he had believed that
Weltsbarrd would be contributing funds and was to be a participant in
the
syndication of the loan funds.  This was because an entity was to be nominated.
He was then asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Syndication involves participation with the lender in the loan funds,
doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It commonly involved an assignment to the syndicate member of a fraction
of the mortgage?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It involves some documentation to identify their respective rights and
interests . . .'.</i>
<P>

[T 158]
<P>

327   	Mr Cleary was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	The equity sharing agreement which you prepared involves the
participation of Weltsbarrd with the borrower or developer, doesn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It does not involve the participation by Weltsbarrd with the lender Burns
Philp Trustee Company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Syndication, as you have explained, involves the participation in the
lending, doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The equity sharing agreement by its terms does not involve participation
in the lending?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Syndication would not involve the provision for a 50% share in the
profits of the borrower, would it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It could.  That's what happened here.</i>
<P>

<i>. . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>The equity sharing agreement in the terms which you drafted
contains no reference to the word `syndication' does it?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>No reference to the concept</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The equity sharing agreement by its terms which you drafted is not
dealing with syndication as such is it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>There is no document showing any proposed advance by Weltsbarrd pursuant to
the terms of the equity sharing agreement, is there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 161-162]
<P>

328   	Mr Cleary was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	There is no document, is there, suggesting that Burns Philp had
consented to the syndication of its $20million loan advanced in
part to
Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	At that time?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Nor was there any at the time of settlement on 14 November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Nor on 28 November 1985?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	. . . </i><cite>If the commercial point was that Weltsbarrd would
contribute funds to the loan advance which Burns Philp had agreed in the first
instance
to make, there would have been no point in keeping secret from the
trustee company the involvement of Weltsbarrd</cite><i> . . . </i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is a hypothetical question you are putting to me.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I agree with that. . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 163]
<P>

329   	Mr Cleary accepted that in relation to the only record of
his instructions on 24 October which was comprised of the two notes
of that
date, they made no reference to any participation by the company which became
Weltsbarrd with the loan advance from Burns
Philp.  [T 166]
<P>

330   	Mr Cleary's evidence was that the Solicitor's Certificate
issued on 14 November 1985 was similar to that used by him in the
Sandy Point
Beach Resort loan transaction.  He accepted, however, that there was no Equity
Sharing Agreement in the Sandy Point Beach
Resort loan transaction.  It was
also put to him and I accept, that there is no sensible comparison to be made
between the Certificates.
 DX6 used in July 1985 in relation to the Sandy Point
Beach Resort transaction and the Certificate used dated 14 November 1985 in
the
PMA 1 transaction.
<P>

331   	Mr Cleary accepted that the PMA 1 transaction in fact
continued through the whole of the period from the initial advance
on 14
November 1985 through the second stage advance on 28 November 1985 and through
the further advances on 30 May 1986 up to the
further advances in late October
1986.  [T 171]  Mr Cleary was then asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And it is throughout the whole of that time that you said that you
didn't know or suspect that Reuben Lew had any involvement
or effective
practical control of Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

[T 171]
<P>

332   	Again in relation to the PMA 2 transaction, Mr Cleary's
evidence was that he did not have any knowledge throughout that same
period but
specifically around July, that Mr Reuben Lew had any involvement in or control
of Yossarian which was the company involved
in the PMA 2 transaction.  [T
171]
<P>

333   	In relation to the 15 November 1985 letter from Cleary
&amp; Hoare to Mr Reuben Lew of EMM, it will be recalled that this
letter
included the following:
<P>

<i>`We enclose copy acknowledgment of payment of $1 pursuant to the Equity
Sharing Agreement which we would be pleased if you would sign
on behalf of
Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty Limited and return to us.'</i>
<P>

334   	Mr Cleary was asked and answered as follows in relation
to this document:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And that records your request to Reuben Lew at Estate Mortgage to sign
on behalf of Weltsbarrd doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It requests Estate mortgage to have it signed.  I have filed a subsequent
affidavit or statement that explains that I used the
word `you' loosely and in
that letter which was a very good example I have used words `you' referring to
a whole range of parties.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:  Q.	</i><cite>Is it your evidence that you understood that it
was in fact Estate Mortgage Managements which was behind Weltsbarrd Holdings or
originally
behind an entity as you referred to it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No your Honour.  </i><cite>I understood they were giving the instructions
on behalf of whoever was behind it and I didn't know who was behind
it</cite><i>.  Just like they were giving Cleary &amp; Hoare instructions on
behalf of Burns Philp in respect of the other money advances, they
were giving
instructions to Cleary &amp; Hoare on behalf of Weltsbarrd.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Was it your perception that it was possible that Estate
Mortgage managers may have themselves been involved in some fashion with the
Equity Share Agreement or Weltsbarrd?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I didn't know who it was and I didn't address my mind to who
was behind Weltsbarrd</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Had it crossed your mind it may be Estate Mortgage Managers
involved with Weltsbarrd would you not then have had, as you see it, an
obligation to be very careful to protect Burns Philp as against Estate Mortgage
Managers?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes.  I didn't know who was behind it, they were giving me the
instructions though</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In this letter of 15 November 1985 you do not say to Estate Mortgage
Managers, we would be please if you could arrange for the
equity share
agreement to be signed by Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty Limited, do you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you don't say, we would be please if you could arrange for the equity
share agreement to be signed by Weltsbarrd Holdings,
do you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You say, if you would sign on behalf of Weltsbarrd Holdings Pty
Limited?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And do I understand your evidence is what you meant in that paragraph was
if you, Estate Mortgage Managers would sign on behalf
of Weltsbarrd Holdings,
or do I misunderstand?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Reconstructing from the letter what I intended was would Estate Mortgage
arrange for the document to be signed by whoever was the
appropriate
person.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Pembroke  Q.	Who was that Mr Cleary, Mr Khemlani or somebody?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have no idea.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Was there some Arab Sheik that you thought was behind Weltsbarrd, would
you give his Honour a straight and honest answer to that
question?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have no idea who was behind.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you were acting for some unnamed, unknown person, were you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, receiving instructions from Estate Mortgage Group.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour  Q.	Was there any reason as far as you knew it, that you were not
given the identity of those unknown persons that you
say you believed Estate
Mortgage represented?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, there was no reason I was aware of who was behind it hadn't been
given.</i>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Isn't it usual for a solicitor to ascertain the identities of
the person or persons for whom he or she acts?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Never in my life as a solicitor, have I ever known the firm I
was in to want to know particulars for someone they were acting for
lending
money</cite><i> . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Pembroke  Q.	Of course if you did know or have reason to suspect that Estate
Mortgage Managers had a financial interest in the transaction
through
Weltsbarrd it would have been improper and dishonest to conceal knowledge from
the trustee, would it not, it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If you knew or had reason to suspect that Estate Mortgage had a financial
interest in the transaction through Weltsbarrd, it would
have been improper and
dishonest for you not to disclose to the trustee all of the information which
you had about Weltsbarrd's involvement
through the equity share agreement in
the transaction?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour  Q.	Is it correct to say there was nothing particular that you
had become aware of which indicated to you or suggested
to you that the
so-called second shareholder or entity was not related to Estate Mortgage
Managers?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No your Honour, there was no information either way  . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 185]
<P>

335   	At transcript 190, the following cross examination took
place:
<P>

<i>`Pembroke Q.	it is simply not honest for you to assert in your evidence that
you did not know at the time of the PMA 1 transaction
that Reuben Lew was not
in effective practical control or involved with Weltsbarrd is it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's not correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is not honest for you to assert that you did not know that Estate
Mortgage Managers was involved with Weltsbarrd at the time
of the PMA 1
transaction is it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's not correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is not honest for you to assert that you thought the justification for
the introduction for Weltsbarrd to the equity share agreement
was for the
purpose of syndicating the loan?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is not correct.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And . . . I am suggesting to you it is not honest for you to put forth
that certificate [referring to the Sandy Point Solicitor's
Certificate] was a
justification for your 14 November Certificate being innocently devised?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't agree with what you are putting to me  . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 190]
<P>

336   	As to the 27 November 1985 letter and to the 28 November
1985 letter and to the issue of whether Mr Lew had rung and whether
Mr Scanlan
informed Mr Cleary that Mr Lew had rung, Mr Cleary's evidence was that he had
no recollection whatever of it being conveyed
to him that Mr Reuben Lew was
very concerned that there be no reference to the Equity Sharing Agreement in
correspondence of Burns
Philp.  He had no recollection of any urgent
conversation with Mr Scanlan on the morning of 28 November, but in the ordinary
course
of business, he would have read the 28 November letter which had signed.
He had no recollection of the fact that the letter, which
was replaced, was
different from the letter which was sent on 28 November.
<P>

337   	Mr Cleary was asked at transcript 201 as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Do you agree that when you sent the Certificates of 14 and 28 November
in the form in which you did, you were giving effect to
Mr Lew's instructions
to you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Giving effect to the instructions from Estate Mortgage yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You had received at that time no communications from the Burns Philp
Trustee Company signifying any awareness on its part of the
existence of an
equity sharing agreement, had you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Name one?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The deed of loan.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You had received no communications from the Burns Philp Trustee Company
signifying any awareness of the existence of the equity
sharing
agreement?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, the deed of loan was signed by Burns Philp and it referred to
it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is that all that you refer to?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is all that I can remember.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You had received no communications from the Burns Philp Trustee Company
signifying any awareness of knowledge of the financial
involvement in the
transaction of the Lews had you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I cannot swear whether or not I had communication from the Trustee.  I do
not recall any.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You provided no information and gave no advice to the Trustee, which
conveyed whatever knowledge that you had about the equity
sharing agreement or
the involvement of Weltsbarrd did you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not in correspondence directly to the Trustee.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

[T 201]
<P>

338   	At transcript 204, the following evidence was given by Mr
Cleary in cross examination.
<P>

<i>`Q.	In several places in your statement, you say that you believed at the
time of the PMA transactions that Burns Philp Trustee Company
knew of
Weltsbarrd or Yossarian or the equity sharing agreements?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And don't say that you believe that Burns Philp Trustee Company knew of
the financial involvement of the Lews in the financial
transactions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If that is what you say, it is.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I would like you to be sure you can agree with me?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would you like me to repeat the question?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You do not say that Burns Philp Trustee Company knew of the financial
involvement of the Lews in the PMA transactions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would have to read the statement again but that is what the intent of
what the statement was trying to say.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You cannot say that, because of your evidence which you would have this
Court accept, you did not know yourself of the financial
involvement of the
Lews?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is what I meant.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In fact, you did know of the financial involvement of the Lews, didn't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you did not tell the Trustee what you knew?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is not so.'</i>
<P>

[T 204]
<P>

339   	In relation to the PMA 2 transaction, Mr Cleary accepted
that he was the supervising partner in relation to the transaction
and he
supervised the drafting of the transaction documents.  It was in the normal
course of events that he would have supervised
the preparation of the
documents.  He accepted that he is aware that in relation to that transaction,
Yossarian was introduced through
the Equity Share Agreement and that he knows
that instructions came to him about it from Mr Lew at Estate Mortgage Managers.
He was
then asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And in all respects, the line of communication in relation to that
company seemed to be the same as the line of communication
in relation to
Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you were in a position to know, or assume, that those who controlled
Weltsbarrd were the same persons who controlled Yossarian,
weren't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You knew of no one else other than the Lews who might be
interested in Yossarian, did you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Well, I just didn't know who it was</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can you point to anyone in the world who might have been
involved in Yossarian other than the Lews</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It could have been anyone</cite><i>.  I didn't know . .
.'</i>
<P>

[T 206]
<P>

340   	Mr Cleary was asked in relation to the 22 June 1990 date
whether he could recall that on that date Reuben and Richard Lew
were arrested.
He did remember that they had been arrested but he could not remember the
precise date.
<P>

341   	Mr Cleary was reminded that on that day he submitted a
proposal on behalf of the firm of Cleary &amp; Hoare for increased
insurance
cover for up to $10 million.  He did not accept that he did this because of the
possibility that the circumstances which
had by then been brought to his
attention may have given rise to a claim against the firm necessitating
increased cover.  [T 209]
<P>

342   	Mr Cleary's evidence at transcript 209 was :
<P>

<i>`Q.	The purpose of your submitting that proposal was to protect the partners
of the firm against the possibility of a claim greater
than the then current
level of cover which you had?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Generally speaking are you talking about?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Generally speaking?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.  I presume so, if it's going up, yes.'</i>
<P>

[T 209]
<P>

343   	At transcript 210, Mr Cleary was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	On the first working day after your examination on 27 July you sought
increased cover up to $40 million for the firm?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Did I?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you recall that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  I would have to refresh my memory but</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would you like to see the document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I accept what you're saying.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you did so on 30 July, which was the Monday after your examination,
because of your increased concern that the circumstances
which had been brought
to your attention commencing with the examination of Mr Scanlan back in June
and concluding with your own
examination on 27 July might give rise to a claim
in connection with the PMA transactions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not so.  Quite the contrary.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you say quite to the contrary, what precisely do you have in
mind?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There was no concern that anything had been done other than in the
ordinary course of business.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Had Mr Scanlan informed you of the substance of the examination of him on
19 June?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He informed a partners' meeting that he had been told not to disclose his
evidence but that he had been told that he was not under
suspicion.   . . .  To
my recollection he informed the partners that he was not under suspicion and
that - well, he simply informed
us that he was not under suspicion and that he
could not discuss his evidence.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you're state of knowledge was one which did not include any detailed
understanding of the allegations put to Mr Scanlan on 19
June?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You say it was just coincidence, do you, that you sought increased cover
on the day of the Lew's arrest?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And coincidence that you sought increased cover on the first working day
after your examination?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes..  You say "I".  Those matters were handled by an office manager and
a sub-committee of partners and the partners.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Russ was the office manager wasn't he?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you were the senior partner?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was the senior partner, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you signed the proposals?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Well there is no getting away from the fact that you were the senior
member of the firm responsible for those decisions on 22 June
and 30 July
weren't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I signed the documents.  As I said, at that time those matters were
handled by the office manager with a sub-committee of partners
who would report
to the partners meetings.'</i>
<P>

[T 210-211]
<P>

<b>Evidence given by Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Scanlan following the amendments
to the pleadings and following the grant of leave to further
cross-examine</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence of Mr Cleary</b>
<P>

344   	Mr Cleary accepted that in June 1990 it was he who
arranged the insurance on behalf of the firm and that he did so on behalf
of
each partner in the firm.  He assumed that, and I find that, it was he who had
been responsible or involved in the arrangement
of insurance for the firm since
the firm was founded in 1981.
<P>

345   	Mr Cleary was shown the June 1990 proposal form and the
section entitled `A Memorandum' was pointed out to him.  He accepted
that he
had treated both the Proposal and the Certificate of Insurance as documents
both of which had come from the Insurers.  He
accepted that the Proposal was
relevant to the Policy so that if the Proposal was accepted the Policy would
issue.  It was his understanding
that the acceptance of the Proposal would lead
to the issue of the Policy.  He knew when he signed the Proposal on 22 June
1990 that
it was the only Proposal for the firm and the partners and that it
provided that it required to be signed by one of the partners.
 He had seen in
the section marked `A Memorandum' the paragraph reading: 
<P>

<i>`You must disclose to insurers all information which is of importance to
them in deciding whether to issue insurance cover to you,
including facts or
conduct which might lead to a claim being made by you or by any person entitled
to protection under the Certificate
of Insurance.  If you fail to do so, your
rights to claim under the Certificate of Insurance may be affected.'</i>
<P>

346   	As he had understood the position when completing the
Proposal, he had to look at the position of other partners and this
was in fact
what the office manager was employed to do.
<P>

347   	He had signed the declaration at the foot of the second
page of the Proposal and accepted that it had been necessary to look
at the
position collectively by reference to the circumstances known to all of the
partners and to any one of the partners.  He accepted
that he could not take
the position when signing the Proposal on behalf of the firm and his partners
that it was unnecessary for
him to ascertain whether there were any claims
circumstances known to the other partners.  He accepted that it was not only
necessary
to ascertain whether there were any claims against other partners but
was also necessary to ascertain whether there were any claims
circumstances
known to the other partners in the sense of `circumstances which may give rise
to a claim'.
<P>

348   	He accepted that his understanding was that the effect of
the document was that it was necessary to ascertain from the other
partners
whether they were aware of circumstances which may give rise to a claim because
of the conduct of persons employed in their
group or under their supervision.
He had followed the events as they unfolded in relation to the Estate Mortgage
Trusts from April
through to June 1990 in so far as the relevant publicity was
concerned.  He had an interest, he accepted, in understanding what was
happening.
<P>

349   	He accepted that it was likely that there was discussion
amongst the partners in relation to the notice served on Mr Scanlan
on 14 June
1990 to attend to give evidence before the NCSC.  He accepted at transcript 255
that he knew that one of the subject matters
which was proposed to be addressed
with Mr Scanlan at his examination was the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions.  He
believed that those
were the only two transactions which had involved an Equity
Sharing Agreement.  This, he recalled made those transactions different
from
all the other transactions carried out from the Estate Mortgage Group.  He knew
that the examination of Mr Scanlan involved
the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions.
He remembered those transactions.
<P>

350   	At or about the time when the Estate Mortgage Managers
were removed, he became aware of that fact.  He had read reports in
the
Financial Review.
<P>

351   	Mr Cleary accepted that by the time of the handing over
of files in June 1990, following Mr Scanlan having been served with
a notice to
produce the firm's documents, he, Mr Cleary, was aware of the specific focus on
the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions by the
NCSC.
<P>

352   	Mr Cleary would have read in the paper that Mr Reuben and
Mr Richard Lew were both arrested and although he could not recall
the specific
dates it is clear that this took place on the 22nd of June 1990
<P>

353   	I reject Mr Cleary's evidence that there was no
relationship between the arrest of the Lews and the submission of the proposal
on 22 June 1990.
<P>

354   	Mr Cleary's examination had taken place on a Friday and
on the following Monday the firm had sought quotations to increase
the firm's
existing professional indemnity cover.
<P>

<b>Evidence of Mr Hoare</b>
<P>

355   	Mr Hoare and Mr Cleary had had an equal equity interest
and Mr Isles a lesser equity interest in the partnership.
<P>

356   	Mr Hoare had been aware of the service of the summons on
Mr Scanlan on 14 June 1990 and recalled that it had been appropriate
for Mr
Scanlan to be represented.  He was asked whether it was drawn to his attention
that part of the particular focus of the NCSC's
examination of Mr Scanlan was
to be the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions and his answer was `It is possible.  I
can't say it wasn't'.
 On my findings the probabilities are that this matter
was drawn to his attention prior to 30 June 1990.
<P>

357   	Mr Hoare had read the warrants on or shortly after 1
August 1990.  His evidence was:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And you understood it was being alleged that Cleary and Scanlan had
concealed things from Burns Philp?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	With the Lews, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you understood that the concealment related to the Equity Sharing
Agreements?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you understood, surely, that that, if true, would have been a breach
of duty by Mr Cleary and Mr Scanlan?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Acting in their capacity as partners and employees respectively of the
firm in 1985 and 1986?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

[T 277]
<P>

358   	In relation to the letter of 7 August 1990 from Mr Hoare
to Law Claim, Cleary &amp; Hoare had stated that no allegations
of negligence
had been raised against the firm.  Mr Hoare was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And you said, we will keep you informed should there be any further
developments whereby negligence is alleged or implied?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You said that, did you not, because you recognized that on the facts
revealed by the charges or the warrants if they were shown
to be correct, there
was the possibility of a claim against the firm?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I suppose I must have been aware that there was some possibility down the
track.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that possibility arose or would have arisen from the same facts which
were being referred to in the charges which had been
served on your partners
. . . from the allegations if they were proved to be correct?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, if the allegations had been proved correct, there was a possibility
of a claim against the firm, yes.'</i>
<P>

[T 278]
<P>

<b>Evidence of Mr Scanlan</b>
<P>

359   	Mr Scanlan accepted that at the end of his examination on
27 July 1990, he understood that there was an allegation of wrongdoing
and of
breach of duty being made against him for not informing BPTC of certain matters
in relation to the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions.
 He was asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And you knew that if the breach of duty was established there would be a
civil liability, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well I suppose so . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But it was the same conduct being considered, wasn't it, whether it gave
rise to criminal consequences or civil consequences?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, I suppose so, yes . . .'</i>
<P>

[T 286]
<P>

360   	On a number of matters relating to the particular
increase in the firm's cover of 27 July 1990, Mr Scanlan's evidence was
that he
could not recall the particular facts.
<P>

<b>Dealing with the case</b>
<P>

<b>The Issues</b>
<P>

361   	The Insurers identified seven issues by reason of which,
they say, they are not liable to meet the Trustees' claim (on some
bases,
wholly and on other bases, for certain years). [Transcript day 3 189 line 40 -
192 line 10]
<P>

362   	Those issues are:
<P>

i.	The application of the dishonesty exclusion.
<P>

ii.	The application in Years 2 and 3 of the known claims or claims
circumstances exclusion.
<P>

iii.	The breach of contract claim (clause 4(b)) for Years 2 and 3.
<P>

iv.	Prior notification - applicable to Year 3.
<P>

v.	One claim or two claims.
<P>

vi.	Section 54.
<P>

vii.	Election (6 and 7 are really one issue).
<P>

363   	In addition, there is the Insurers' cross-claim for
recovery of the $500,000 paid by Cleary &amp; Hoare to the Trustees pursuant
to
the first settlement and retained by the Trustees under and on the terms of the
second settlement.
<P>

364   	The degree of complexity of the main insurance issues on
the approach put forward by the Trustees, becomes apparent from
the flow chart
prepared by the Trustees which deals separately with the Dishonesty Exclusion
and the known claims circumstances defence.
 The flow chart reads as
follows:
<P>

<i>`SECTION A  -   DISHONESTY EXCLUSION</i>
<P>

<i>PMA 1</i>
<P>

<i>14 November 1985</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Was Cleary dishonest (in whatever sense "dishonest" has) as at 14
November 1985 (initial PMA 1 facility of $20.65 million)?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If yes:  Trustees cannot recover in respect of the advance of $2,650,000
made on 14 November 1985 (Exhibit DX Volume 1 page 310)
but may be able to
claim in respect of subsequent advances.</i>
<P>

<i>B.	If no:  Go to "Known Claims Circumstances" Defence Section B.  If the
policies for years 1, 2 or 3 respond, the Trustees succeed
at least in respect

<b>The Trustees Submissions as to legal principle</b>
<P>

367   	The Trustees submitted as follows:
<P>

<i>(i)	`Although clause 5 is an exclusion clause, it is to be construed
according to its natural and ordinary meaning, read in the light
of the
contract as a whole, so giving due weight to the contractual context, and to
the nature and object of the contract and of
the clause in question.
[Underwriters at Lloyds v Ellis (CA40239/95, 25 February 1998 unreported) at 29
(Powell JA, with whom Meagher
and Handley JJA agreed) citing Darlington Futures

<P>

<i>(ii)	In the case of ambiguity, the clause is to be construed contra
proferentem.  In this case the "proferens" of the clause is clearly
the
Insurers.</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	The exclusions in clause 5 must be construed in the contractual
context in which they are found and having regard to the nature
and objects of
the contracts of insurance.  In other words, they must be construed among other
things in recognition of the circumstance
that the contracts of insurance are,
in their primary layers, compulsory; and are mandated for the protection of
solicitors' clients.
 Whilst these considerations may not permit the court to
avoid giving the words of clause 5 their natural and ordinary meaning, they
will dictate that:</i>
<P>

<i>i.	the words should not be given an unduly or artificially expansive
meaning;</i>
<P>

<i>ii.	where the words are capable of more than one construction, the
construction most consistent with the nature and object of the
contract should
be preferred; and</i>
<P>

<i>iii.	in case of doubt or ambiguity, but consistent with the preceding basis
of construction, the words should be construed contra
proferentem: in this
case, against the interests of the Insurers.</i>
<P>

<i>iv.	The key words in clause 5(e)(v) are those which describe the conduct
giving rise to the excluded liability.  They are the words
"the dishonest or
fraudulent act or omission of the Assured."  Although the Insurers may wish to
focus upon the word "dishonest",
clause 5(e)(v) must be construed as a whole.
The relevant conduct - "act or omission" - must be capable of being
characterised as
"dishonest or fraudulent" if the exclusion is to apply.
Whether the conduct is to be so characterised will depend upon, firstly,
the
meaning to be given to the words "dishonest or fraudulent" and, secondly, upon
an examination of the acts or omissions proved
to see if they can fall within
that description on its proper construction.  Both the task of construction of
the words "dishonest
or fraudulent" and the task of examination and
characterisation of the conduct in question must reflect the circumstance that
it
is "any description of civil liability whatsoever" - including breach of
fiduciary duty - that can give rise to a claim for indemnity.
 They must also
reflect the circumstance that the real victim of a finding that the exclusion
applies is not the solicitor but the
client for whose benefit and protection
the scheme of compulsory cover has been put in place.</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	It is clear from clause 5(e)(v) that the expression "the Assured" has
the extended meaning which is one of the several meanings
set out in clause
1(a).  The rationale for this is that even if an individual insured partner is
personally innocent of the dishonest
conduct, he or she is not entitled to
indemnity if the conduct itself was dishonest within the meaning of clause
5(e)(v).  This illustrates
that which of the several meanings of the expression
"the Assured" is applicable from time to time in the policy depends on the
context:
a point discussed below with particular reference to clause
4(b).</i>
<P>

<i>(vi	The ordinary English meaning of the word "dishonest" is a question of
fact.  It is a question which may be answered by resort
to dictionaries.  The
Macquarie Dictionary gives the meaning of "dishonest" as:</i>
<P>

<i>"1. Not honest; disposed to lie, cheat or steal:...2.  Proceeding from or
exhibiting lack of honesty; fraudulent."</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The same source gives the meaning of the word "fraudulent" as:</i>
<P>

<i>"1. Given to or using fraud, as a person; cheating, dishonest.  2.
Characterised by, involving, or proceeding from fraud, as actions,
enterprise,
methods, gains, etc."</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The meaning of the underlying word "fraud" includes:</i>
<P>

<i>"1. Deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, by which it
is sought to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage;...3.
Any deception,
artifice, or trick."</i>
<P>

<i>(ix)	The legal meaning of "fraud" is of course well established: a false
representation of fact made knowingly or without belief in
its truth or
reckless of its truth or falsity.  [At the risk of unnecessary citation, see
Derry v Peek <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1889/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1889] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20AC%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14 App Cas 337</a> and the legion of cases which follow
it.]</i>
<P>

<i>(x)	The underlying theme of the dictionary definitions of "dishonest" and
"fraudulent" is that of intention.  This is emphasised,
in the case of
dishonesty, by other dictionary definitions, [See for example the Shorter
Oxford Dictionary] and in the case of fraud
by the legal concept already
referred to.  The requirement for an element of intention has been emphasised
in a number of cases dealing
with exclusion clauses in language identical or
substantially similar to the language of clause 5(e)(v).  Those cases were
gathered
and analysed in Schipp v Cameron (ED 6425/91, 9 July 1998 unreported).
A number of the cases there cited are of particular relevance.</i>
<P>

<i>(xi)	The question was considered by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of
Queensland in Crowe v Wheeler and Reynolds (1988) 1Qd R
40.  In that case the
relevant exclusion applied to "loss arising out of any claim...brought about by
the dishonesty or fraudulent
act or omission" of the insured [see Williams J at
41].  Williams J, with whom Andrews CJ agreed, referred to a decision of Fraser
J in the Supreme Court of Ontario: Lynch &amp; Co v United States Fidelity and
Guarantee Co. [1971] 1OR 28.  Williams J concluded
[at 43] that "the term
"dishonesty" should be applied in the way suggested by Fraser J.  In the
exclusion clause in question the
term "dishonesty" refers to an act involving
some intent to deceive or cheat and that involves a question of fact to be
determined
in the circumstances of each particular case."  Fraser J had said
[1971] 1OR at 38, "dishonest is normally used to describe an act
where there
has been some intention to deceive or cheat.  To use it to describe acts which
are merely reckless, disobedient or foolish
is not in accordance with popular
usage or the dictionary meaning.  [His Honour had referred earlier to the
Shorter Oxford Dictionary].
 It is such a familiar word that there should be no
difficulty in understanding it."</i>
<P>

<i>(xii)	In neither case - Crowe or Lynch - was reference explicitly made to
the full contractual context or the objects for which the
contract in question
was made.  However, in the Trustees' submission, a consideration of those
matters supports the conclusion that
the word "dishonest" should be given a
construction which requires the element of intention to be present.  To give it
a wider construction
would have the effect of enlarging the ambit of the
exclusion and thereby diminishing the protection available, through the
compulsory
scheme of insurance, to solicitors' clients.</i>
<P>

<i>(xiii)	The decision in Crowe, being a decision of the Full Court of the
Supreme Court of Queensland (it will be remembered that the
contracts in
question in this case are contracts of compulsory professional indemnity
insurance made for practitioners in Queensland)
is of particular significance,
considering as it does a form of insurance which is obviously an ancestor of
and very similar in wording
to the certificates of insurance presently under
consideration.</i>
<P>

<i>(xiv)	Support for the approach taken in Crowe is to be found in the decision
of JD Phillips J in HG &amp; R Nominees Pty Ltd v Fava
[1997] 2VR 368.  In that
case too there was an exclusion for "liability arising... from or brought about
by the dishonesty or fraudulent
act or omission of any insured" [1997] 2 VR at
417.  JD Phillips J, after considering a submission that "fraudulent act or
omission"
extended the conduct in question beyond mere "dishonesty",
concluded:</i>
<P>

<i>"...I am not yet clear how far the concept of "recklessness" can be imported
into this exclusion clause.  However it be put, I think
that what is relevant
to the operation of the exclusion clause with which I am concerned is some
conscious and deliberate conduct
on the part of the insured, which amounts to
"dishonesty or [a] fraudulent act or omission".  Perhaps that means that the
exclusion
will be brought into play where a solicitor signs a false statement,
not only when he knows it to be false, but also where, having
considered what
is being said and realising that he does not know if it is true or false, he
subscribes his name to it nonetheless
and with reckless indifference.  In other
words, the exclusion will operate if the solicitor actually knows that what he
is lending
himself to is untrue, and it may perhaps operate also if he is
conscious, when he signs, that he is lending his name to something
as true when
he does not know if it is true or not.  That is how the words "fraudulent act
or omission" could be given some effect,
but I do not need to decide it" [1997
2 VR at 421-422].</i>
<P>

<i>(xv)	An exclusion in identical terms to that presently under consideration
was considered by Hunter J in McCann v Switzerland Insurance
Australia Limited
(Comm D 50227/95, 26 June 1998 unreported).  The clause excluded "any
liability...brought about by the dishonest
or fraudulent act or omission of the
Assured" [The clause is set out by Hunter J at 222.  It should be noted that
the words following
those quoted are radically different to the equivalent
words in the subject certificates but it does not appear from the decision
of
Hunter J that his views on the meaning of "dishonest or fraudulent act or
omission" depended in any way on the sentence following
the sentence in which
those words appear.]   Hunter J considered a large number of cases including
Crowe, Lynch and HG &amp; R Nominees.
 Hunter J considered the concept of
fraud.  He did so for the following reasons [at 240]:</i>
<P>

<i>"I have laboured over this treatment of the concept of fraud partly for the
reason that I think it has the capacity to colour the
meaning of both dishonest
as that element is invoked in the dishonesty exclusion, applying the principle
of noscitur a sociis.  In
particular, such an approach, I think, draws
attention to the need to see dishonesty in the context of injury to an
entitlement or
putting at risk of injury the entitlement of another, as
distinct from attempting an examination of a concept of dishonesty in vacuo
by
definition of standards and the like.  Moreover, although it is clear from the
authorities that fraud and dishonesty may relate
to injury to other than
economic entitlements, I think it clear from the context of the dishonesty
exclusion that its operation is
concerned only with injury or the risk of
injury to an economic entitlement.</i>
<P>

<i>As earlier stated, I think bare breach of duty is, alone, insufficient to
satisfy the test of dishonesty."</i>
<P>

<i>(xvi)	His Honour's view that the word "dishonest" drew meaning from its
juxtaposition with the word "fraudulent" is supported by the
decision of Steel
J in Abbey National PLC v Solicitors Indemnity Fund Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20PNLR%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) PNLR
306.</a></i>
<P>

<i>(xvii)	The conclusion that Hunter J reached was expressed as follows at
244-245:</i>
<P>

<i>"What I think is clear from East End, [A reference to the decision of Rolfe
J in East End Real Estate Pty Ltd v CE Heath Casualty
and General Insurance
Limited (1993) 7ANZ Insurance Cases 61-151.] and the other authorities to which
I have referred, is that mere
breach of duty, without more, is insufficient to
constitute dishonesty, consistently with the view that where the purpose of a
particular
duty founded in regulation is to be found in ensuring primacy of
honesty in the duty of relationship, little more is needed than
proof of the
breach to establish actual dishonesty.</i>
<P>

<i>...For the purpose of the dishonesty exclusion, I think the concept of
dishonesty involves an intentional act, or omission where there
is a duty to
act, which deprives another of money or valuable property or puts at risk or
prejudicially affects that other in relation
to some lawful economic right,
interest, opportunity or advantage, knowing that the actor has no right to
deprive that other of the
money or property or to put it at risk or to so
prejudice the interest of that other.  Knowledge that there is no right so to
act
may be derived from the existence of a duty or from representations made to
the object of the dishonesty.  The duty may arise out
of statute or out of the
legal relationship between the parties.  While recklessness itself is not
tantamount to dishonesty it, clearly,
may evidence the existence of
dishonesty."</i>
<P>

<i>(xviii)	The Trustees submit that this conclusion is proper, having regard to
the authorities reviewed by Hunter J, and that it ought
to be applied in the
present case.</i>
<P>

<i>(xix)	As noted both by Einstein J in Schipp and by Hunter J in McCann, there
are some cases in which it is suggested that it is not
a necessary ingredient
of the concept of dishonesty that there be intention - specifically, intention
to deceive.  One such case
is thought to be the decision of the Court of Appeal
of New Zealand in McMillan v Joseph (1987) 4 ANZ Insurance Cases 91/60-822.
 A
number of things may be said about that decision:</i>
<P>

<i>i.	firstly, it is clear that the court was not saying that dishonesty could
be found otherwise than by making a finding of deliberate
conduct [See for
example the judgment of Somers J at 75, 055]</i>
<P>

<i>ii.	secondly, the specific holding was that what was not necessary was
conduct activated by an intention to deceive (as opposed to
conduct
deliberately intended to achieve whatever was the natural or intended end of
that conduct) [See the analysis of Hunter J
in McCann at 231 - 233]</i>
<P>

<i>iii.	thirdly, intention to deceive is not irrelevant; rather, the question
of intention to deceive is to be ascertained not by subjective
considerations
of the state of mind of the individual in question but rather against what is
an appropriate objective standard of
honesty [See the analysis of Einstein J in
Schipp at paragraph 917];</i>
<P>

<i>iv.	in any event, to the extent that the decision in McMillan establishes
some variable content in the meaning of the word "dishonest"
in its own right
(a point which the Trustees certainly do not accept) then firstly, applying the
principle of construction noscitur
a sociis, the meaning to be attributed to
"dishonest" in the context of clause 5(e)(v) may be informed by its
juxtaposition with
the words "fraudulent conduct" (in the composite phrase
"dishonest or fraudulent conduct of the Assured"); and secondly, to the extent
that there is any remaining ambiguity or duality of meaning, the word should be
construed contra proferentem so as to diminish rather
than enhance the scope of
the exclusion to cover of which it forms part.</i>
<P>

<i>(xx)	For these reasons, the Trustees submit that the dishonesty exclusion
(clause 5(e)(v)) should be construed so as to require the
conduct which is said
to amount to a "dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of the Assured":</i>
<P>

<i>i.	to involve a deliberate act, or deliberate omission to act where there is
a duty to act;</i>
<P>

<i>ii.	having the effect of depriving another of money, property or a lawful
economic right or interest etc;</i>
<P>

<i>iii.	or putting at risk or prejudicing another in one of those ways;</i>
<P>

<i>iv.	in circumstances where the person who acts or omits to act knows that he
or she would or might, but has no right to, deprive or
put at risk the money,
property, etc of the other.</i>
<P>

<i>(xxi)	This formulation substantially follows the conclusion expressed by
Hunter J in McCann.  To the extent that it goes beyond the
conclusions
expressed by Einstein J in Schipp, the Trustees respectfully submit
[Particularly in a context where the views expressed
in Schipp were necessarily
obiter dicta] that the conclusion of Hunter J in McCann should be
adopted.</i>
<P>

<i>(xxii)	It necessarily follows from this statement of the approach to be
taken to the construction of the dishonesty exclusion that
a mere breach of
duty, even of a fiduciary duty involving concepts of honesty and disclosure,
cannot be characterised as dishonest
or fraudulent unless it is deliberate or
intentional (in the sense that there must be a deliberate decision, or
intention to perpetrate
the breach of duty) accompanied by knowledge that there
is no right or justification so to act, and with knowledge that the money
or
property etc of another will be diminished or may be put at risk in
circumstances where there is no right to diminish it or put
it at risk.  In
other words, although it is not necessary to find that the conduct in question
was activated by an express intention
to cheat or deceive, it cannot be
characterised as dishonest unless the circumstances clearly show firstly
deliberation or intention
and secondly knowledge of the likely consequences and
that those consequences cannot be justified. </i>
<P>

<i>(xxiii)	Any lower requirement would put at risk the protection clearly
intended to be afforded to clients of solicitors by the scheme
for compulsory
policies of insurance in which the dishonesty exclusion is to be found.
Further, because such policies were obviously
and necessarily intended to cover
loss arising out of, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, any wider
construction of the
words "dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of the
Assured" would introduce a tension into the process of construction of the
exclusion, and a complexity in the resolution of issues of fact relating to the
exclusion, which should be avoided unless there is
no alternative.  Insistence
on intention and knowledge enables the due function of the exclusion clause to
be maintained whilst,
consistent with absence of knowledge and intention,
protecting the rights of clients.  It brings a degree of certainty into the
analysis
and enables people to regulate their affairs with some degree of
confidence.  It achieves a fair balance between the legitimate but
competing
interest of the parties directly or indirectly involved, whilst at the same
time recognising and complying with the common
law principle that one cannot
insure against the consequence of one's own intentional crime or fraud.  [See
Enright, Professional
Indemnity Insurance Law (London, Sweet and Maxwell, 1996)
paragraph 6.030, paragraphs 6.103-6.126]  A lesser standard, as well as
being
destructive of the rights of clients which were clearly intended to be
protected, will be productive of uncertainty.  If the
Insurers wished to have
the benefit of some lower standard of conduct amount to dishonesty it was open
to them to choose appropriate
words to do so.  Where the words used by them can
be given meaning and significance, which avoids arbitrary or capricious
consequences,
the Insurers cannot complain that the words do not go so far, in
a particular case, as they would like.'</i>
<P>

<b>The Insurers' submissions as to legal principle</b>
<P>

368   	The Insurers sought to adopt as correct, the reasoning in
<i>Schipp v Cameron</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 9 July
1998, Einstein J).  The relevant extract from that Judgment is set out
below.
<P>

369   	The Insurers submitted that :
<P>

<i>`Both Cleary and Scanlan accepted that the certificates dated 14 and 28
November were deliberately false in the sense of intentionally
omitting
information resulting in the certificates giving a false picture and
constituting a half truth.  Cleary: T193-200.  Scanlan:
T57-61. Their conduct
was not reckless, foolish or inadvertent.  Each intended to do what was done.
Their conduct was deliberately
intended to achieve what was the natural or
intended end of that conduct.  It is not necessary to show (as the plaintiffs'
submissions
accept: para 34) that the conduct in question was actuated by an
express intention to cheat or deceive.'</i>
<P>

370   	The Insurers sought to support the approach adopted in
<i>Schipp v Cameron</i> in relation to dishonest intention by reference to two
recent decisions, one of the Privy Council and one of the High Court of
Australia.

<P>

<i>`The plaintiff airline appointed as its agent in a particular area for the
sale of passenger and cargo transportation a company of
which the defendant was
the managing director and principal shareholder.  Under the agreement the
company was to hold in trust for
the airline money received from such sale
until it was  accounted for by the company to the airline.  With the
defendant's knowledge
and assistance the company paid the money into its
current bank account instead of into a separate account, and in breach of trust
the company used that money for its own business purposes.  The company failed
to pay to the airline sums due within the time specified
by the agreement.  The
airline terminated the agreement and, the company having become insolvent,
commenced proceedings against the
defendant to recover the money owed by the
company.  The judge held that the defendant was liable as constructive trustee
to pay
that amount to the airline.  On appeal the Court of Appeal of Brunei
Darussalam reversed that decision, holding that the defendant
could not be so
liable because it had not been established that the company was guilty of fraud
or dishonesty in relation to the
money held in trust for the airline.</i>
<P>

<i>On the airline's appeal to the Judicial committee:</i>
<P>

<i>Held, allowing the appeal, that where a third party dishonestly assisted a
trustee to commit a breach of trust or procured him to
do so, the third party
would be liable to the beneficiary for the loss occasioned by the breach of
trust, even though the third party
had received no trust property and
irrespective of whether the trustee had been dishonest or fraudulent;  that in
the context of
such accessory liability honesty was to be judged objectively
and acting dishonestly, or with a lack of probity, which was synonymous,
meant
not acting as an honest person would act in the circumstances and could usually
be equated with conscious impropriety as distinct
from inadvertent or negligent
conduct or carelessness, although a third party might be acting dishonestly if
he recklessly disregarded
the rights of others;  that the third party's conduct
had to be assessed on the basis of his actual knowledge at the time not what
a
reasonable person would have known or appreciated, and regard could be had to
his personal attributes including experience and
intelligence and the reason
for him acting in that way;  and that, accordingly, since the defendant had
caused or permitted the company
to commit a breach of trust by using in the
conduct of its business money held in trust for the airline when he knew that
the company
was not authorized to do so by the terms of the trust, the
defendant had acted dishonestly, and was, therefore, liable to the airline
for
the amount owed to it by the company.'</i>
<P>

372   	In delivering the judgment of their Lordships, Lord
Nicholls of Birkenhead said:
<P>

<i>`<b>Dishonesty</b></i>
<P>

<i>Before considering this issue further it will be helpful to define the terms
being used by looking more closely at what dishonesty
means in this context.
Whatever may be the position in some criminal or other contexts (see, for
instance, Reg. V Ghosh <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1982/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] EWCA Crim 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20QB%201053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] Q.B. 1053)</a>, in the context of the accessory
liability principle acting dishonestly, or with a lack of probity, which is
synonymous, means simply
not acting as an honest person would in the
circumstances.  This is an objective standard.  At first sight this may seem
surprising.
 Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the
objectivity of negligence.  Honesty, indeed, does have a strong
subjective
element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light
of what a person actually knew at the time,
as distinct from what a reasonable
person would have known or appreciated.  Further, honesty and its counterpart
dishonesty are mostly
concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent
conduct.  Carelessness is not dishonesty.  Thus for the most part dishonesty is
to be equated with conscious impropriety.  However, these subjective
characteristics of honesty </i><cite>do not mean that individuals are free to
set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances.  the standard
of what constitutes
honest conduct is not subjective.  Honesty is not an
optional scale, with higher or lower values according to the moral standards
of
each individual.  If a person knowingly appropriates another's property, he
will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because
he sees nothing wrong in
such behaviour.</cite>
<P>

<i>In most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest
person would behave.  Honest people do not intentionally
deceive others to
their detriment.  Honest people do not knowingly take others' property.  Unless
there is a very good and compelling
reason, an honest person does not
participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust
assets to the detriment
of the beneficiaries.  Nor does an honest person in
such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask
questions,
lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed
regardless.'</i>
<P>

[at 389]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>`The only answer to these questions lies in keeping in mind that honesty is
an objective standard.  The individual is expected to
attain the standard which
would be observed by an honest person placed in those circumstances.  It is
impossible to be more specific.
 Knox J. captured the flavour of this, in a
case with a commercial setting, when he referred to a person who is `guilty of
commercially
unacceptable conduct in the particular context involved:'  see
Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd. v. Eagle Trust Plc.   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All E.R. 700</a>, 761.
Acting in reckless disregard of others' rights or possible rights can be a
tell-tale sign of dishonesty.  An honest person
would have regard to the
circumstances known to him, including the nature and importance of the proposed
transaction, the nature
and importance of his role, the ordinary course of
business, the degree of doubt, the practicability of the trustee or the third
party proceeding otherwise and the seriousness of the adverse consequences to
the beneficiaries.  </i><cite>The circumstances will dictate which one or more
of the possible courses should be taken by an honest person.  He might, for
instance,
flatly decline to become involved.  He might ask further questions.
He might seek advice, or insist on further advice being obtained</cite><i>.  He
might advise the trustee of the risks but then proceed with his role in the
transaction.  He might do many things.  Ultimately,
in most cases, an honest
person should have little difficulty in knowing whether a proposed transaction,
or his participation in
it, would offend the normally accepted standards of
honest conduct.'</i>

subjective sense, is irrelevant.  His Honour said at para 80:</i>
<P>

<i>"In the paradigm case of conspiracy to defraud - an agreement to induce
persons to buy property by making fraudulent misrepresentations
- the charges
made out upon proof that the accused agreed to induce persons to part with
their property by the making of statements
which the accused knew were untrue.
Whether or not the accused believed that what they were doing was honest is
irrelevant to the
charge.<b>  </b>Obtaining property by statements which are
known to be untrue is the employment of dishonest means."</i>
<P>

<i>McHugh J also said at para 79:</i>
<P>

<i>"Proof of a conscious design on the part of the conspirators to use
dishonest means is essential to proving the charge.  But this
does not mean the
defendants must know that they were acting dishonestly - whether dishonesty is
judged by their standards or their
knowledge of the standards of ordinary
people."</i>

<P>

<b><i>`Exclusion Clause</i></b><i> </i>
<P>

<i>910	The Seventh Defendant is not liable to indemnify the Third Defendant in
respect of any liability he may incur if one of the categories
in Clause 5 of
the policy entitled `General Exclusions' applies. The policy does not indemnify
the Third Defendant "in respect of
any liability ... brought about by the
dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of the Assured ...": Clause 5(e)(v).
The Seventh Defendant
submitted that there was dishonesty on the part of Mr
Harrison such that the exclusion clause applied. . . . </i>
<P>

<i>912	The Policy does not define the word "dishonest". The meaning of the word
is primarily a question of the proper construction of
the policy, but in the
absence of any indication within the document as to the meaning of the words,
the words should be given their
ordinary meaning. In Underwriters at Lloyds v
Ellis (unreported, Court of Appeal, 25 February 1998, per Meagher, Handley and
Powell
JJA) Powell JA stated that the following approach should be taken in
interpreting an exclusion clause of the type  sought to be relied
on by the
Seventh Defendant:</i>
<P>

<i>".. it is now accepted that the interpretation of an exclusion clause is to
be determined by construing the clause according to its
natural and ordinary
meaning, read in the light of the contract as a whole, thereby giving due
weight to the context in which the
clause appears including the nature and
object of the contract, and, where appropriate, construing the clause contra
proferentum
in case of ambiguity (see, for example, Darlington Futures Ltd v
Delco Australia Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/82.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 82</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 500)."</a> [at 29]</i>

<i>913	 "Dishonesty" is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as
constituting conduct that is:</i>
<P>

<i>"Discreditable as being at variance with straightforward or honorable
dealing; underhand, now, fraudulent, thievish, knavish."</i>
<P>

<i>914	That definition has been accepted by many of the authorities in which
the question as to whether or not an exclusion clause which
allows an Insurer
to refuse to indemnify the Assured on the grounds that their conduct was
dishonest or fraudulent has been raised:

(unreported, Court of Appeal, 24 February 1998, per Meagher, Handley and Powell
JJA). Those authorities
offer some guidance as to the application of clause
5(e)(v) in these proceedings. </i>
<P>

<i>915	The ambit of the conduct which will be "dishonest" is not entirely clear
from the authorities. <b> </b>In particular, there is some question as to
whether or not an intention to deceive is required.  The Full Court in
Queensland has
held that dishonesty requires "an act involving some intent to
deceive or cheat": Crowe v Wheeler &amp; Reynolds  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20Qd%20R%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 Q R 40</a> at 43. Most
recently, J D Phillips J in H G &amp; R  Nominees v Fava [at 421] in relation
to an exclusion clause in a solicitor's
professional indemnity policy in
similar terms to clause 5(e)(v) held that "what is relevant to the operation of
the exclusion clause
is ... some conscious and deliberate conduct on the part
of the insured."  The Plaintiff submitted that those authorities which asserted
that dishonesty required an intention to deceive or cheat, or the existence of
knowledge that conduct was "not straight forward but
underhand", should be
followed.</i>
<P>

<i>916	There is, however, also authority for the proposition that the nature of
conduct that may be characterised as "dishonest" is not
limited to conduct
which is actuated by an intent to deceive: McMillan v Joseph (1987) 4 ANZ
Insurance Cases 61-162 at 75,056. In
that case in the New Zealand Court of
Appeal, Casey J gave some consideration to the meaning of the word "dishonest"
in a policy
similar to the one before the Court. His Honour stated:</i>
<P>

<i>"I accept the appellant's submissions that "dishonest" is used in the sense
of deliberate conduct carrying out its ordinary meanings
(amongst others) of
`not straightforward' and `underhand'. Like fraud, the term is of wide
application in the almost infinite variety
of human activity and while the
general concepts it embodies are well </i><cite>understood, attempts to analyse
or define them narrowly is fruitless</cite><i>. In any given case a decision on
whether conduct is dishonest is best left to the common sense and experience of
the judge or jury
after consideration of all the relevant circumstances. The
test is an objective one and in the context of this policy </i><cite>the
insured's conduct is to be judged by that standard of honesty generally
accepted as appropriate for members of the legal profession
in their dealings
with their clients. Because of the trust reposed in them it may well be higher
than the standards expected in some
other areas of business and commercial
life.</cite><i>"</i>
<P>

<i>917	The Seventh Defendant submitted that this case was authority for the
proposition that "there can be dishonesty without an intent
to deceive"
[Seventh Defendant's Submissions paragraph 2.4.5] and that it is this line of
authority which  should be followed by
the Court in these proceedings. I would
not accept the Seventh Defendant's submission without qualification. It seems
to me that,
Casey J did not hold that intention to deceive was irrelevant to a
finding that conduct was dishonest, </i><cite>merely that the relevant
intention was not to be determined by the actual state of mind of the
individual whose conduct was in question.
Rather, deliberate conduct or
intention was to be inferred by the Court assessing the conduct against an
objective standard of honesty
accepted as appropriate in the
circumstances</cite><i>. It is on the basis of this objective test that Casey J
included as a relevant consideration standards and codes of conduct of the
profession of the particular individual whose conduct is impugned.</i>
<P>

<i>918	Australian courts appear to have accepted that professional standards
may be relevant to a court's inquiry into whether particular
conduct was
dishonest. In H G &amp; R Nominees v Fava (supra), Phillips J regarded the
authorities which concerned the meaning of
dishonesty in the context of
professional indemnity policies as falling into two categories.  First, cases
in which the insured professional
makes a deliberately false representation. In
such circumstances, the operation of the exclusion clause is relatively clear
and the
question as to whether or not an intention to deceive is required is
not thrown up by the facts. I interpolate that in the authorities
examined by
Phillips J, false representations concerned situations  such as those in which
a solicitor had given a false certification
of independent advice or purported
to witness a legal document without seeing the party who executed it or should
have executed it:
see Comino v Manettas and the facts of H G &amp; R Nominees
itself. The second category of cases considered by His Honour were those
in
which the question for the Court was "at what point a failure to dishonour
professional standards becomes dishonesty" [at 418].
The cases which Phillips J
considered fell within the second category were McMillan v Joseph, Chittick v
Maxwell and East End Real
Estate. </i>
<P>

<i>919	The Seventh Defendants also relied on East End Real Estate Pty Ltd vt/a
City Living v C E Heath Casualty &amp; General Insurance
Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%207%20ANZ%20Insurance%20Cases%2061%2d151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 7 ANZ
Insurance Cases 61-151.</a> In that case, Rolfe J considered the meaning of the
word "dishonest" in the context of an exclusion clause in a professional
indemnity
policy. His Honour said at 77-798:</i>
<P>

<i>"'Dishonest', in my opinion, generally connotes a degree of moral turpitude
or delinquency, which transcends such a breach of duty
... It does not require
very much more than the breach of duty to bring about dishonesty ... In the
authorities to which I have referred
reference is made, in particular, to the
conduct not being `straightforward' or being `underhand'. To that, for present
purposes,
I would add that </i><cite>the conduct may be dishonest if it is
discreditable as being at variance with honorable dealing.</cite><i> That
places it in a professional or quasi-professional context."</i>
<P>

<i>920	In East End Real Estate, Rolfe J relied on the rules and regulations
which control the conduct of real estate agents to establish
what would
constitute honorable dealing.  Those rules and regulations required that an
offer be conveyed to the principal as soon
as practical after it was received
and therefore, his Honour held that the failure of an agent to convey an offer,
and / or  that
agent being in a position of conflict regarding the fiduciary
duty owed to his / her principal was sufficient to constitute dishonest
conduct. </i>
<P>

<i>921	There was an issue between the Plaintiff and the Seventh Defendant as to
the nature of the duty referred to by Rolfe J. The Plaintiff
asserted that his
Honour was referring to a statutory duty. The Plaintiff submitted that "His
Honour considered matters of law in
conjunction with a positive obligation
placed on the real estate agent by paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Auctioneers
&amp; Agents
Regulations made under the Auctioneers &amp; Agents Act 1941". The
Plaintiff sought to distinguish East End from the present proceedings
on those
grounds.</i>
<P>

<i>922	The Seventh Defendant, however, submitted that the duty referred to by
Rolfe J was not imposed by statute but was either a contractual
duty, duty of
care or fiduciary duty. I accept the Seventh Defendants' submission as to the
nature of the duty referred to by Rolfe
J. His Honour noted that it was common
ground between the parties in the proceedings before him that the conduct of
the real estate
agent which gave rise to the proceedings, namely the failure of
the agent to communicate to the vendor all offers received in respect
of a
certain piece of property, "may amount to either a breach of contract,
negligence or a breach of a fiduciary duty." [at 77,793]
</i>
<P>

<i>923	The Plaintiff also sought to distinguish the decision in East End and
the concept of dishonesty propounded by Rolfe J on the basis
that the
dishonesty exclusion in the policy there under consideration included the
additional words "criminal" and "malicious". In
my view, little turns on the
difference in considering the approach adopted by Rolfe J: cf McCann v
Switzerland Insurance Australia
at 244 per Hunter J</i>
<P>

<i>924	Notwithstanding that the facts in East End differ from the present
proceedings in that Mr Harrison was not under any statutory
obligation of the
kind in that case, it seems to me that the approach of Rolfe J may well be
applicable here. I would read his Honour's
decision as meaning that not every
breach of standards established for a particular profession, whether by
statutory instrument or
by some other means, will result in the conduct in
question being regarded as dishonest. In each case, the nature and content of
the standard would plainly be relevant on the issue.</i>
<P>

<i>925	In East End, Rolfe J observed that "there may well be instances of
conduct imposed by the regulations, breach of which could not
be stated to be
discreditable, not straightforward or underhand": [at 77,798]. Young J in
Chittick v Maxwell  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20118%20ALR%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 118 ALR 728</a> at 749 also observed that a failure to
adhere to professional standards, whether informally imposed by the profession
itself or created
by law, would not in itself be grounds for the operation of
an exclusion clause which allowed an insurer to refuse indemnity on the
basis
that the conduct of the insured was dishonest. His Honour stated:</i>
<P>

<i>"I must confess that, were it not for the decided cases on the word
`dishonest', I would not have thought that it was valid to say
that `dishonest'
had anything to do with the way in which other solicitors of good repute may
regard the conduct of the solicitor
in question. There may be various practices
within a solicitor's profession which solicitors regard with suspicion, but
about which
there is nothing morally or legally wrong. For instance, solicitors
may regard it as improper to deal with a matter without opening
a file for each
matter and making sure all the correspondence in connection with the matter is
kept on the file. However, even if
a solicitor failed to comply with this rule
and so brought down upon himself the odium of the profession, I could not see
how that
failure had anything to do with his being honest or dishonest.
</i><cite>Perhaps  an example that is likely to bring about loss is the
situation where a solicitor acts for both vendor and purchaser or both
mortgagor and mortgagee. That is bad practice, but I would shy away from saying
it is dishonest and I would not wish it to be thought
that the exclusion in the
fidelity insurance policy could apply merely because a solicitor acted for both
parties.</cite> [Emphasis added]
<P>

<cite>926	It seems to me that a failure to adhere to professional standards
will amount to dishonesty if the relevant standard, or standards,
involve an
express obligation to attest to the truthfulness of a matter, to disclose a
particular fact or otherwise act honestly
in some regard</cite><i>.<b> </b>In
my view, it will not be sufficient for conduct to be dishonest that there is a
breach of a standard which merely protects against
careless practices. The
salient consideration is not, however, whether the standard is imposed by the
legislation or by the general
law. </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

<i>927	A similar view of the authorities was adopted by Hunter J in the recent
decision in McCann v Switzerland Insurance Australia (supra).
His Honour said
(at 244):</i>
<P>

<i>"What I think is clear from East End, and the other authorities to which I
have referred, is that mere breach of duty, without more,
is insufficient to
constitute dishonesty, consistently with the view that where the purpose of a
particular duty founded in regulation
is to be found in ensuring primacy of
honesty in the duty relationship, little more is needed than proof of the
breach to establish
actual dishonesty."</i>
<P>

<i>928	Hunter J ultimately adopted a concept of dishonesty in materially
different terms to those which I have considered above. His
Honour expressed
the view that the concept of dishonesty should be understood in terms of a
"context of injury to an entitlement
or putting at risk of injury to the
entitlement of another, as distinct from attempting an examination of a concept
of dishonesty
in vacuo by definitions of standards and the like": at 240. As to
the meaning of the word dishonest, Hunter J held (at 245) that:</i>
<P>

<i>"For the purpose of the dishonesty exclusion, I think the concept of
dishonesty involves an intentional act, or omission where there
is a duty to
act, which deprives another of money or valuable property or puts at risk or
prejudicially affects that other in relation
to some lawful economic right,
interest, opportunity or advantage, knowing that the actor has no right to
deprive that other of the
money or property or to put it at risk or to so
prejudice the interests of that other. Knowledge that there is no right so to
act
may be derived from the existence of a duty or from representations made to
the object of the dishonesty. The duty may arise out
of statute or out of the
legal relationship between the parties. While recklessness itself is not
tantamount to dishonesty it, clearly,
may evidence the existence of
dishonesty."</i>
<P>

<i>929	In reaching this conclusion, his Honour had regard to the concept of
dishonesty which has developed in the context of the criminal
offence of fraud.
I note in passing that, in requiring "an intentional act or omission", I
understand Hunter J to require that there
be deliberate acts or omissions as
opposed to reckless or thoughtless conduct. I do not understand Hunter J to
include as a fundamental
element of the concept of dishonesty, an intent to
deceive, although clearly, like recklessness, such evidence would presumably be
relevant to the existence of dishonesty as the concept was formulated by Hunter
J.</i>
<P>

<i>930	Without expressing any view as to the concept of dishonesty ultimately
formulated by Hunter J, it seems to me that that concept
embraces a greater
variety of conduct and situations than it is necessary to be adopted by me in
the context of the proceedings now
before me. In McCann v Switzerland Insurance
Australia, there was an issue as to whether the misappropriation of moneys in
certain
trust funds held by Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley as trustee could be said
to have been brought about by the dishonest or fraudulent
conduct of a partner
of that firm. Hunter J held that the misappropriation was not actuated by an
intention to defraud the trust
and the question which his Honour was then
required to determine was whether the conduct of the partner could be said to
have been
dishonest or fraudulent on the basis that the conduct of the partner
was imprudent or reckless.</i>
<P>

<i>931	The Plaintiff submitted to the Court that Mr Harrison's conduct in
breach of both fiduciary duties and duties of care owed to
Mrs Schipp in his
capacity as her or a solicitor  was not actuated by fraud or dishonesty, but
was rather the product of Mr Harrison's
preoccupation with his own financial
difficulties. This submission might have raised questions as to whether or not
recklessness
was sufficient to ground a finding that Mr Harrison's conduct was
dishonest in the relevant sense. In the light of the findings of
fact which I
have made, the issue did not, however, arise. As stated above in consideration
of the fiduciary duties and duties of
care owed to Mrs Schipp by Mr Harrison
and breached by him, I do not accept that Mr Harrison's conduct in relation to
Mrs Schipp
was as result of his being pre-occupied. Rather I have found that,
together with Mr Cameron, Mr Harrison deliberately managed and
manipulated Mrs
Schipp into a position advantageous to him.</i>
<P>

<i>932	The fiduciary duties and duties of care which a solicitor owes to a
client constitute, it seems to me, duties the failure to adhere
to which may
well, depending on the precise circumstances, allow the relevant conduct to be
characterised as dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>933	I have held that Mr Harrison acted as Mrs Schipp's solicitor, or a
solicitor, in respect of a number of matters earlier spelled
out. I have
further held that by virtue of Mr Harrison's position as a solicitor, he owed
to Mrs Schipp fiduciary obligations and
duties of care which he breached, and
breached flagrantly, in the furtherance of his own interests. In the light of
these findings
and notwithstanding the fact that Mr Harrison also breached
fiduciary obligations springing from relationships independent of fiduciary
duties springing from his position as a solicitor, it seems to me that Mr
Harrison's relevant conduct was dishonest and that the
exclusion in clause
5(e)(v) of the policy was activated.'</i>
<P>

375   	I see no reason to depart from those expressions of
principle.  Neither party submitted that the decision of the New South
Wales
Court of Appeal in <i>Switzerland Insurance Australia Ltd &amp; ors v McCann
&amp; ors</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Appeal, 27 August
1999) upholding the appeal from Hunter J's decision in <i>McCann</i> included
any fresh statements of principle on the meaning of the dishonesty exclusion.
The parties accepted that decision of the
Court of Appeal turned on `proximate
cause', the Court implicitly accepting, without deciding one way or the other,
that the test
formulated by Hunter J could be used as a `working' test.  Hence
the approach taken in <i>Schipp</i> to the Hunter J test is not required to be
revisited by reason of the Court of Appeal decision.
<P>

<b>Findings as to dishonesty</b>
<P>

376   	As I have said, I am satisfied that Mr Cleary was an
unreliable witness. In relation to the key issues, his evidence was
inconsistent with the contemporaneous documents and contrary to the
probabilities.
<P>

377   	The central propositions in Mr. Cleary's evidence, each
of which involved him asserting the improbable, were as follows:
<P>

(a) 	He had no knowledge or suspicion of the involvement of Mr Reuben Lew or
EMM in Weltsbarrd or Yossarian throughout the whole
of the period of the PMA1
and PMA2 transactions from October 1985 to October 1986: statement, paras 65
and 67;
<P>

(b) 	He believed that the second shareholder under the Equity Sharing
Agreements (Weltsbarrd or Yossarian) would be contributing
funds as part of the
syndication of the loan: statement, para 37;
<P>

(c) 	He believed that BPTC knew about the involvement of Weltsbarrd and
Yossarian and the Equity Sharing Agreements and he assumed
that EMM would show
all relevant correspondence to BPTC: statement, para 38;
<P>

(d) 	The certificate dated 14.11.85 was based on the Sandy Point certificate
and was the certificate as to title referred to in
the trust deed: statement,
para 48.
<P>

(e) 	The Equity Sharing Agreement was a condition precedent of the loan because
of the reference in Section 18 of the letter dated
22.10.85, under the heading
"<i>Valuation Qualification Requisitions</i>", to "<i>Equity participation
arrangements</i>" : statement, paras 26 and 49;
<P>

(f) 	He had no recollection of the 27 and 28 November 1985 letters, or the
circumstances relating to the change in the 27 November
letter or any
conversations with Reuben Lew or Mr. Scanlan in relation thereto: statement,
para 52;
<P>

(g) 	He did not turn his mind particularly to the fact that Weltsbarrd and
Yossarian could obtain a substantial economic benefit
from the PMA
transactions: statement, para 66.
<P>

378   	As to proposition (a) above, Mr Cleary's assertion of
lack of knowledge or suspicion runs counter to much of the evidence
adduced.
It is difficult to single out any particular segment of that evidence, as my
finding is based upon the whole of the evidence.
 The finding is also based
upon the probabilities.  The finding is also based upon the sequence of events
in relation to Mr Cleary's
instructions, already set out.
<P>

379   	One matter of particular importance is Mr Cleary's
handwriting appearing on Exhibit DX 8 already referred to.  Mr Cleary
was
unable to give any explanation as to why he had written that note on the copy
of the 15 November 1985 letter addressed to EMM.
 The words used were `that
interest was held beneficially for EM' and those words are written as relating
to Weltsbarrd.
<P>

380   	Also of relevance is Mr Cleary's evidence at transcript
173-174 that the letter of 25 October 1985 was being sent `to the
other
parties, as it were, to the transaction being the party otherwise than those,
being the PMA company group'  [T 173].  This
cross-examination included:
<P>

<i>`Q.	So that the purpose of the letter was to show the draft Equity Sharing
Agreement to the persons who represented those interested
in the Equity Sharing
Agreement other than the PMA Group?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	To ensure that the draft document accords with their intention and their
instructions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it was evolving.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And in the paragraph numbered 3, you said to the addressee of the letter
that :  We considered providing that you would simply
have an option to buy
shares.  That is a reference to the way in which the interests other than PMA
interests would acquire an interest
in the borrower company?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you go on to say:  but in view of the fact that you are going to
share in the net profit of the operation of the premises from
day 1, we
recommend that you actually take up shares?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That's a reference to the intention that from day one the interests other
than the PMA interests were going to share equally in
the profit which
hopefully would be achieved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	From the increased value of the property yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	From the proposed transaction?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.    . . .</i>
<P>

[T 173-174]
<P>

381   	Also of relevance are the terms of the 5 November 1985
memorandum from Mr Cleary to Mr Priddle and the cross-examination
on that
document, earlier referred to in this Judgment.
<P>

382   	Also of relevance is Mr Cleary's evidence in relation to
the 5 November 1985 letter written to Mr Lew of EMM, earlier set
out.
<P>

383   	Also of relevance are the terms of the 15 November 1985
letter from Cleary &amp; Hoare to Mr Lew and use of the word `you'
emphasised
in the above extract of that letter.  Also of relevance was Mr Cleary's
failure, it seems to me, to give any satisfactory
answer to why Estate Mortgage
would have been pleased to know of the assessment of stamp duty on the Equity
Sharing Agreement in
the sum of $18.10 - see the letter of 29 November 1985
earlier referred to and the cross-examination at transcript 187, earlier
referred
to.
<P>

384   	Also of relevance are notes in Mr Cleary's handwriting at
DX vol 2 p 588, cross-examined on at pages 187-188 which Mr Cleary
believed it
was safe to assume came into existence before the completion of the relevant
documents on or about 13 November 1985.
 He had recorded in the middle of this
page the words `one share to our entity' as well as `one share to be held by
PMA Property
Corporation'.  His evidence was :
<P>

<i>`Q.	And when you have used the preposition "our", you are referring to the
interests of Mr Lew and Estate Mortgage Managers are you
not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, the other entity to PMA Properties.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour  Q.	You did not know to whom you were referring on your
evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.  The other entity was to PMA Properties reconstructing from
that note what the reference to "our" entity would refer
to . . .' </i> [T
188]
<P>

385   	I do not accept that in using the words `one share to our
entity' Mr Cleary did not know or at least strongly suspect that
the entity
being referred to, was one in which Mr Reuben Lew or EMM were or were to be
financially involved.
<P>

386   	The whole of the approach to Mr Cleary from the initial
instructions received at the Gold Coast Meeting, made very plain
to him the
significance of the Equity Sharing Agreement as a priority to be resolved
first.  The words `side agreement covering equity
sharing' in the typewritten
note of that meeting are further strongly suggestive of an agreement which
would indeed be a `side agreement',
namely an agreement standing outside, that
is to say to the side of, the central transaction in which Cleary &amp; Hoare
were acting
for BPTC.
<P>

387   	Mr Cleary's assertion of lack of knowledge or suspicion
during 1986 confirms my view that his evidence cannot be accepted
as to his
lack of knowledge or suspicion during 1985.  The documentary evidence in 1986
becomes quite compelling.  As has already
been noted, the letter of 25 February
1986 was from Weltsbarrd, care of Mr &amp; Mrs Lew at their residential address
and was signed
by Mr Reuben Lew.  On my findings, Mr Scanlan showed the letter
to Mr Cleary.  From that time on Mr Cleary had, on my findings, the
clearest
possible indication that the Lews were likely to be financially involved in any
further similar Equity Sharing Agreements.
 Hence when instructions on the PMA
2 transaction required preparation of a further Equity Sharing Agreement and
now involved Yossarian,
Mr Cleary, if he did not already well know, could have
had virtually no doubt but that the Lews were financially involved in
Yossarian.
 The letter of 30 April 1986 had been sent from Weltsbarrd and
returned the duly executed Equity Sharing Agreement which had been
executed by
Mr Reuben Lew and Ms Sandra Lew.
<P>

388   	I was not impressed by Mr Cleary's demeanour in the
witness box.  To my mind, he was well aware of the significance to his
personal
standing and professional status of findings by this Court of his awareness of
the involvement of the Lews in Weltsbarrd
and Yossarian.
<P>

389   	As to the matters referred to in (b) above, Mr Cleary's
evidence appeared to suggest that Weltsbarrd's involvement in the
Equity
Sharing Agreement was commercially justifiable because Weltsbarrd would be a
lender to the transaction.  The Equity Sharing
Agreement did not, however,
involve the syndication of the loan.  Mr Cleary's contemporaneous notes on 24
October 1985 make no mention
of the syndication of the loan.  There are no
contemporaneous documents relating to the syndication of the loan.  I accept
the Insurer's
submission that there would have been no need to keep the
syndication of the loan involving Weltsbarrd's secret from BPTC.  There
were no
instructions about the syndication of the loan which were embodied in the
documentation drafted by Mr Cleary.  No other person
was drafting documentation
relating to the syndication of the loan.  Weltsbarrd's role was clearly stated
in recital H to the Equity
Sharing Agreement which Mr Cleary had drafted.
Weltsbarrd was `procuring' the loan from BPTC.  The sharing of profit under the
Equity
Sharing Agreement was to operate from `day 1' - see the terms of the
letter of 25 October 1985.
<P>

390   	There was no evidence to support any intended future
advance by Weltsbarrd.  I accept the Insurers' submission that there
is no
correlation between the Equity Sharing Agreement and any prospective future
lending by Weltsbarrd, no correlation between the
amount of the profit share
and the amount of any loan and no correlation between the time of commencement
of the profit share and
the time of any supposed advance by Weltsbarrd.
<P>

391   	As to the assertion set out in (c) above, Mr Cleary
conceded that he did not assert that BPTC knew of the financial involvement
of
the Lews in the PMA transactions.  [T 204]  Had Mr Cleary believed that BPTC
knew about the involvement of the Lews in Weltsbarrd
and Yossarian, there would
not have been any need  for secrecy.  There was in fact no need for the
Certificate dated 14 November
1985 to exclude information which was contained
in the preceding letters of 11 November 1985 to Rylands &amp; Hillmer or of 12
November
1985 to Mr Reuben Lew.  There was no need for the Certificate dated 28
November 1985 to exclude the reference to the Equity Sharing
Agreement.  Nor
was there any need to change the Certificate dated 27 November 1985.  Nor was
there any need for Mr Lew to give the
instructions recorded in the notes dated
8 November 1985 and 28 November 1985.
<P>

392   	I accept the Insurers' submission that there is no
evidence whatsoever of any contemporaneous communication from BPTC indicating
any knowledge or awareness of the terms of the Equity Sharing Agreements or the
involvement of the Lews or of EMM in Weltsbarrd and
Yossarian.  I further
accept as correct the Insurers' submission that any suggestion that BPTC did
know of the involvement of the
Lews in Weltsbarrd and Yossarian, or the terms
of the Equity Sharing Agreements, is inconsistent with the concession made on
behalf
of the plaintiffs in Exhibit DX 1.  The essence of that concession, I
accept, was that BPTC did not know the material facts, the
material facts were
not disclosed to BPTC by Cleary &amp; Hoare and that, therefore, the
nondisclosure and concealment by Cleary
&amp; Hoare `brought about' the loss
constituted by the PMA 1 and PMA 2 judgment debts.
<P>

393   	As to the assertion in sub-paragraph (d) above, it will
be recalled that Mr Cleary suggested that there was nothing improper
in his
Certificate dated 14 November 1985 because it was based upon the Sandy Point
Certification.  The Sandy Point transactions
did not, however, involve an
Equity Sharing Agreement.  The Certificates, I accept, are not comparable - see
Exhibit DX 6 and see
transcript 168-170.
<P>

394   	As to the assertion in (e) above, I accept the Insurers'
submission that this is a far-fetched ex-post facto reconstruction.
 The
reference in section 18 of the letter of 22 October 1985 under the heading
`Valuation qualification requisitions' to `Equity
participation arrangements'
is, I accept, a reference which could equally apply to the proposed syndication
of the loan.  [See transcript
p 131 and 164-165]  The previous transaction had
involved a syndicated loan.  Mr Cleary's evidence was that he expected the PMA
1
transaction would also involve a syndicated loan.  However, in fact, the
Equity Sharing Agreement did not, as I accept, involve any
question of
syndication or participation with the lender - see transcript 158-168.  The
Equity Sharing Agreement involved a very
different concept of participation
with the borrower.  The phrase `equity participation arrangements' in section
18 of the letter
of 22 October 1985 is, I accept, fortuitous and co-incidental.
I accept the Insurers' submission that that phrase does not justify
or explain
Mr Cleary's secrecy as against BPTC in relation to the drafting of the Equity
Sharing Agreement nor the concealment of
its terms and of the financial
involvement of the Lews.
<P>

395   	As to the assertion in sub-paragraph (f) above, I do not
accept Mr Cleary's evidence in this regard when he asserts that
he has no
recollection of these events.  I accept the Insurers' submission that it is
inherently improbable, given the seriousness
of the issue and Mr Cleary's
recollection of other events both before and after that he has no recollection
of these events.  Mr
Cleary was unable or unwilling to provide even a `snippet'
of information about these events.  [T 199]  To my mind, the inference
from the
27th and 28th November Certificates appropriate to be drawn, including the file
note of the conversation with Mr Reuben
Lew, is adverse to Mr Cleary.  There is
no reasonable explanation capable of being put for or in fact put forward by Mr
Cleary. 
At the end of the day, I cannot accept Mr Cleary's evidence that he
has no recollection of the 27th and 28th November 1985 letters
or the
circumstances relating to the change in the 27th November letter or of any
conversations with Mr Reuben Lew or Mr Scanlan
in relation thereto:  statement
paragraph 52.
<P>

396   	As to the assertion in sub-paragraph (g) above, Mr
Cleary's improbable evidence is set out in paragraph 66 of his statement.
 That
evidence is clearly contradicted by his memorandum to Mr Priddle of 5 November
1985 to which he did not refer in his statement.
 Ultimately, Mr Cleary
conceded that paragraph 66 could not be correct - T 175-178.  I do not accept
Mr Cleary's evidence that he
did not turn his mind particularly to the fact
that Weltsbarrd and Yossarian could obtain a substantial economic benefit from
the
PMA transactions:  statement paragraph 66.
<P>

397   	My assessment of Mr Cleary as an unreliable witness takes
into account that in my view he denied the obvious and was unwilling
to make
frank admissions in relation to documents which were not referred to in his
statement or which he had not seen in preparation
for his evidence.  This
includes:
<P>

(a)	His unwillingness to accept that he received the draft Deed of Assignment
in relation to the syndication of a loan [see Exhibit
DX 5, T 131-133 and
158-160]
<P>

(b)	His unwillingness to agree that the Sandy Point Certificate provided no
sensible point of comparison with the Certificate dated
14 November 1985
because there was no Equity Sharing Agreement involved in the Sandy Point
transaction [see Exhibit DX 6 and T 169-170]
<P>

(c)	His denial of knowledge of the involvement of Mr Lew or EMM,
notwithstanding his annotation on the copy of the letter of 15
November 1985
recording with an arrow pointing to Weltsbarrd, the words `interest held
beneficially for EM'.
<P>

(d)	His denial of knowledge of the involvement of Mr Lew in Weltsbarrd,
notwithstanding his own annotation on the letter of 25 February
1986 from
`Weltsbarrd care of R &amp; S Lew' - see transcript 205-206.
<P>

(e)	His supplementary statement which implausibly propounded the theory that
`you' where appearing in any letter addressed to Reuben
Lew, did not in fact
mean `Reuben Lew'.
<P>

(f)	His evidence given late in his cross-examination (T 207-208) that the
reference to `side agreement' in his diary notes of 24
October 1985, should
read `site agreement'.
<P>

398   	I accept the Insurers' submission that what appears to
have occurred was a rapidly increasing alignment by Mr Cleary with
the
interests of Mr Reuben Lew and EMM to the exclusion of BPTC.  Mr Cleary had
sought out the work of the Estate Mortgage Group,
Mr Priddle having informed
him of the possibility of obtaining the larger financing work from the Group
previously done out of Sydney
and Melbourne.  It was plainly attractive to Mr
Cleary to seek to obtain that work and he approached Mr Reuben Lew and
introduced
himself and offered his firm's services, hoping for an increase in
flow of work.  Mr Cleary appears to have been prepared to align
himself with
the interests of Mr Reuben Lew and EMM which in terms of BPTC not having been
given all of the necessary information,
resulted in basic breaches of duty to
BPTC.  Mr Cleary knew on my findings from a very early point in time that there
was an inconsistency
between his `official' instructions (the letter of 31
October 1985) and Mr Lew's unwritten instruction (the Equity Sharing Agreement
side arrangement).  Mr Cleary's conduct became deliberate and intentional by
the time of the issue of the Certificate of 14 November
1985 and following Mr
Lew's direction of 28 November 1985, by the time of the revised and sanitised
Solicitor's Certificate of 28
November 1985.  At the time of each of those
Certificates, the relevant intention of Mr Cleary was, on my findings, to
conceal information
from BPTC because these were Mr Lew's instructions.
<P>

399   	On my findings, Mr Cleary, if not aware prior to 28
November 1985 that the Equity Sharing Agreement was not to be referred
to in
any correspondence with the Trustee, clearly on that day became so aware.  The
significance of the Equity Sharing Agreement
had been made plain to him at the
original Gold Coast instructions meeting.  He was well aware at all material
times of the potential
profits involved in the Equity Sharing Agreement and of
the large amounts which the borrower and those interested in the borrower
were
likely to make in the transactions.  He either knew or strongly suspected that
the Lews were financially involved (in the sense
of having financial interests)
in Weltsbarrd and later Yossarian.  On my findings, Mr Cleary:
<P>

(a)	at no stage believed that the involvement of Weltsbarrd or Yossarian was or
was akin to that of a contributor of funds as part
of a syndication of the
subject BPTC loans;
<P>

(b)	at all material times either knew or strongly suspected that the Equity
Sharing Agreements involved the participation as `profit
share companies' of
Weltsbarrd and Yossarian - that is to say as companies which were to share in
the very substantial economic benefits
which the Equity Sharing Agreement would
in all probability permit.
<P>

400   	At the risk of some repetition, the evidence which
suggests that Mr Cleary either had actual knowledge that the Lews were
financially involved in Weltsbarrd and later Yossarian or alternatively
strongly suggests such involvement may be viewed in the context
of the
following evidence of Mr Cleary:
<P>

<i>"Q.  Was it your perception that it was possible that Estate Mortgage
Managers may have themselves been involved in some fashion with
the equity
share Agreement or Weltsbarrd?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  I didn't know who it was and I didn't turn my mind to whom was behind
Weltsbarrd."</i>
<P>

[Transcript 184]  [Emphasis added]
<P>

401   	This answer and particularly the section emphasised above
runs counter to the following factors and evidence:
<P>

(a)	Mr Cleary's letter of 15 November 1985 addressed to Mr Reuben Lew, EMM
enclosing the acknowledgment of payment of $1.00 pursuant
to the Equity Sharing
Agreement and stating that "We would be pleased if <u>you</u> would sign on
behalf of Weltsbarrd Holdings ... "
<P>

(b)	Mr Cleary's involvement in the setting up of the proposed structure to the
extent of considering various options and recommending
"that <u>you</u>
actually take up shares" - see 25 October 1985 letter to Mr Lew earlier
referred to.
<P>

(c)	The fact that a decision was taken to avoid obtaining guarantees from the
shareholders of Weltsbarrd.
<P>

(d)	Mr Cleary's early November 1985 expectation "that more than $20 million
will be distributed under the Equity Sharing Agreement
within three years"
[Memorandum of 5 November 1985 to Mr Priddle]
<P>

(e)	Mr Cleary's letter of 5 November to Mr Lew, but now addressed as Financial
Consultant to "Estate Mortgage Financial Services
Limited" and seeking "the
name of <u>your</u> associated company to be involved to be `the second share
holder'".
<P>

(f)	The references to Weltsbarrd as "the profits share company" in the
facsimile to Mr Cleary of 11 November 1985.
<P>

(g)	Mr Cleary's inability to name anyone in the world other than Mr Reuben Lew
who, on the information available to him at the time,
to his knowledge, stood
behind Weltsbarrd.
<P>

(h)	Mr Cleary's receipt of instructions that Weltsbarrd was not a related
company to be BPTC - see letter of 12 November 1985.
<P>

(i)	The references to "our entity".
<P>

(j)	The fact that Mr Cleary, subject only to the input from Mr Lew and Mr
Hilmer was the author of the Equity Sharing Agreement.
<P>

(k)	The inherent unlikelihood that a solicitor could act and receive
instructions from a company without either ascertaining who
was behind the
company or at the least forming a strong belief as to that matter.
<P>

(l)	The lack of secrecy in Mr Lew's having quite openly written to Cleary and
Hoare with typed "sender" detail from Weltsbarrd c/-
R A &amp; S Lew - 25
February 1986 letter.
<P>

(m)	The fact, conceded by Mr Cleary, that if the commercial point was that
Weltsbarrd would contribute funds to the loan advance
from BPTC, there would
have been no point in keeping the involvement of Weltsbarrd secret from
BPTC.
<P>

402   	The principal factor which may suggest that up to 27
November 1985 Mr Cleary was not actually aware of the involvement of
the Lews
in Weltsbarrd is the writing of the original Second Solicitor's Certificate in
terms referring to the Equity Sharing Agreement.
 Granted that the Certificate
was submitted to Mr Reuben Lew `for on forwarding to [BPTC]', yet still the
fact is that the Certificate
ex facie certified to the preparation inter alia
of `Bill of Encumbrance (Equity Sharing Agreement)'.  And yet Mr Scanlan's
evidence,
after some prevarication with the cross-examiner, was that he had no
doubt in November 1985 "that Mr Cleary knew who it was who was
his client at
Weltsbarrd".  [T 67-68]  I cannot accept on the evidence that on and prior to
27 November 1985 Mr Cleary did not have
a well founded and strong suspicion
that the Lews (or at the least Mr Reuben Lew) had a financial interest in
Weltsbarrd.  Mr Cleary
may well have known this fact - the evidence has many
pointers in this regard, but cannot be said to be absolutely clear, in the
sense of the onus of proof incumbent upon the trustees.  [Section 140(1) of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> (NSW) stipulates a single standard of proof for all
civil cases, namely the balance of probabilities.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s140.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 140(2)</a> preserves the
doctrine in <i>Briginshaw v Briginshaw</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336</a> at 361-362;
<i>Pedler v Richardson</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 16 October 1997,
Young J) at 10-11.]  But what is quite clear, on the evidence, is that the
events
of 28 November and the instructions from Mr Lew to `change the
Certificate' and to keep all letters about the Equity sharing Agreement
separate and to make no reference to the Equity Sharing Agreement in
correspondence addressed to BPTC (which instructions I find
were conveyed by Mr
Scanlan to Mr Cleary), represented a clear and strong indication, read as such
by Mr Cleary, to the effect that
Mr Reuben Lew was interested in Weltsbarrd and
to the effect that an important matter (the Equity Sharing Agreement and the
bill
of encumbrance associated with it) were not to be revealed to BPTC.
Hence, whatever the knowledge of Mr Cleary up to this point in
time as to the
precise position, the events of 28 November in fact brought home to him the
existence of circumstances which spoke
volumes in terms of non disclosure and
conflict of duty.  If Mr Cleary was not yet aware of the involvement of the
Lews or at least
Mr Reuben Lew in Weltsbarrd by now, then on this day his
previously strongly held suspicions of such involvement received corroboration
of the highest order.
<P>

403   	In those circumstances, Mr Cleary's conduct falls within
the description, `discreditable as being of variance with straightforward
or
honourable dealing, underhand' [see the definition of `Dishonesty' extracted
above from the Shorter Oxford Dictionary].  His actions
in participating in the
issue of Solicitors' Certificates which failed to disclose the Equity Sharing
Agreements and ancillary encumbrances
and in failing to disclose his knowledge
or suspicion of the Lew's or at least Mr Reuben Lew's, financial involvement in
the PMA
1 and PMA 2 transactions, were conscious and deliberate.  The
Certificates included deliberately false representations.  His conduct
was
clearly, as the Trustees concede, in breach of the fiduciary obligations owed
by Cleary and Hoare to the BPTC.  But it went further.
 It involved a degree of
moral turpitude or delinquency which clearly went well beyond and transcended
that breach of duty.  This
was a failure to adhere to professional standards
which involved an express obligation to attest to the truthfulness of a matter
and to disclose particular facts and to act honestly in certifying as to the
agreements and encumbrances prepared and executed as
part of the transaction.
In Mr Cleary's case, his own conduct and the conduct in which he participated,
went well beyond mere recklessness
or thoughtlessness.  Mr Cleary was clearly
placed in a situation in which he either well knew or alternatively had strong
grounds
for suspecting and actually suspected, that the Lews were, or at the
least Mr Reuben Lew was, financially interested in Weltsbarrd
and Yossarian as
part of a side arrangement documented by the Equity Sharing Agreement.  He
clearly knew also that BPTC would rely
on the Solicitor's Certificates and knew
that the Certificates were false in that they omitted material information.  Mr
Cleary's
conduct was `dishonest' within the meaning of the clause 5(e)(v)
dishonesty exclusion.
<P>

404   	Turning to Mr Scanlan, to my mind he also was not a
reliable witness. 
<P>

405   	My assessment of Mr Scanlan as a witness is that he
sought to underestimate considerably his involvement in the necessary
legal
work involved in documenting the subject transactions.  I do accept, however,
that he has not been shown to have consciously
or deliberately intended to
deceive or mislead the Trustee.  The degree of recklessness, however, involved
in the particular circumstances
where, having first issued a Certificate he was
then informed by Mr Lew of the necessity to change the Certificate and went
along
with that matter, albeit having discussed the same with Mr Cleary,
without himself questioning the significance of the new instruction,
to my mind
places Mr Cleary well and truly within the ambit of the `dishonesty exclusion'.
The Certificate of 28 November was deliberately
false in the sense of
intentionally omitting information resulting in the Certificate giving a false
picture and constituting a half
truth.  Both Mr Scanlan and Mr Cleary
participated in the decision to send out the redrawn Certificate.  A
Solicitor's Certificate
to a lender is a signally significant document.  And
when prepared on an occasion where a settlement advance is to be made in a
situation
where the solicitors retainer expressly provided that the solicitors
were `to take all steps necessary to fully protect the position
of the Trustee
and manager keeping both parties fully informed on all matters relating to
[the] transaction', the significance of
the Solicitor's formal certification
becomes absolutely plain.
<P>

406   	Mr Scanlan was unwilling to accept that he understood the
basic operation of the Equity Sharing Agreement.  I reject this
evidence.
<P>

407   	The Insurers submitted that the Court should not accept
Mr Scanlan's denial of any knowledge of the involvement of Mr Reuben
Lew in
Weltsbarrd or Yossarian, despite the fact that he had taken instructions from
Mr Lew and had written to the directors of Weltsbarrd
and Yossarian care of Mr
Lew.  
<P>

408   	Whilst the matter is one of some difficulty on the
evidence, bearing in mind the gravity of the allegation that Mr Scanlan
was
aware of the involvement of Mr Lew in Weltsbarrd and Yossarian, to my mind the
Insurers have not proved that knowledge in this
case.  [See the earlier
reference to <i>Pedler v Richardson</i>.]
<P>

409   	Mr Scanlan's evidence was that he was a relatively newly
admitted solicitor involved under Mr Cleary's supervision in a large
conveyancing transaction [the word `conveyancing' is used to refer to what is
more accurately described as a transaction in which
the solicitors prepared
loan and security documents and carried out ancillary conveyancing work] and
simply failed to appreciate
that he was doing anything wrong in following Mr
Lew's instructions and in acting under Mr Cleary's supervision.  To a large
extent
I can accept that in a pressured environment and under supervision by
the partner who had taken instructions, Mr Scanlan may have
simply failed to
focus on the possible significance of what was occurring.  I cannot however
accept that Mr Scanlan had no grounds
for suspicion that something untoward was
occurring when he was required on the very day when the further PMA 1 advance
was to take
place, to alter the Solicitor's Certificate already issued and when
he was advised that there was to be no reference made to the
Equity Sharing
Agreement in correspondence with BPTC.
<P>

410   	Ultimately the dishonesty exclusion case does not in fact
turn on whether or not the denials by Mr Cleary and Mr Scanlan
of actual
knowledge of the involvement of the Lews in Weltsbarrd and Yossarian, are
accepted.  Their deliberate conduct resulting
in intentional concealment
amounted to "dishonest conduct" by reference to the objective standard of what
ordinary honest people
would have done in the circumstances and by reference to
the objective standard of what ordinary honest solicitors would have done
in
the circumstances.
<P>

411   	As will have become clear from what has been written
above, my finding is that Mr Cleary was either in fact aware of the
involvement
of the Lews, or at least of Mr Reuben Lew, in Weltsbarrd or Yossarian, or was
very strongly suspicious [to an extent
of being as close to certain as may be]
of that involvement.
<P>

412   	Mr Scanlan on the other hand engaged in conduct which was
reckless in the extreme.  He had grounds for suspicion that something
did not
ring true.  He clearly came to suspect at some point in time, that there was a
financial involvement of the Lews, or at least
of Mr Reuben Lew, in Weltsbarrd
and Yossarian.  His grounds for suspicion were, at least initially, based on
his instructions to
change the second Solicitors Certificate and to keep all
letters about the Equity Sharing Agreement separate and to make no reference
to
the agreement in correspondence with BPTC.  But in contradistinction to the
position which obtained in relation to Mr Cleary,
Mr Scanlan could not be close
to certain that his suspicions were correct.  The suspicions were nevertheless
tangible and real and
based on considerations which were far from insignificant
or insubstantial.  True it is that his evidence rings true that he did
not stop
to contemplate the <u>real</u> significance of the instructions he had
received.  Yet my finding is that he was by no means asleep on the occasion in
question.
 He simply failed to<u> fully</u> grasp the significance of the
instruction and the change to the solicitors certificate.  He did not fail to
grasp the fact that these
matters were not insignificant.  Mr Scanlan knew that
the 28 November certificate was untrue in the sense that it left out important
information.  The Certificate of 28 November was in fact deliberately false in
the sense of intentionally omitting information resulting
in the Certificate
giving a false picture and constituting a half truth.  He acted on Mr Lew's
instructions after clearing that matter
with Mr Cleary.  His evidence was that
he went to Mr Cleary `with these concerns' [transcript 57].  There is no doubt
that he was
aware that Mr Lew saw the matter as of particular importance.  He
was in a hurry and did not step back to weigh up in his own mind
the suspicion
which he harboured as to why this was happening.  He was too busy to apply his
mind to a concern which on my findings
he had at the time.  He should have
asked further questions but did not.  He was swept up in the flow of things, by
the magnitude
of the matter, by Mr Lew's standing and Mr Cleary's imprimatur of
Mr Lew's direction.
<P>

413   	Mr Scanlan's conduct involved a participation in the
issue of the substitute second Solicitors Certificate.  He did not sign
the
certificate.  He did not sign the letter under cover of which the certificate
was sent.  He did, however, <u>continue</u> to be involved in the conveyancing
transactions relating to PMA1 and PMA2.  Mr Scanlan accepted that it was likely
that he knew by
30 May 1986 of the involvement of the Lews in Weltsbarrd.  The
high probability is that he was close to certain of that involvement
on about
25 February 1986.  [See the letter from the Lews of that date].  On 30 May 1986
the third Solicitors Certificate was signed
by Mr Cleary and sent to BPTC.  It
made no reference to the Equity Sharing Agreement nor to the collateral
security.  In June and
July 1986 Mr Scanlan continued to be actively involved
in the conveyancing transactions.  In late July he signed the letter reminding
Mr Lew that the firm had "yet to receive your instructions in respect of the
provision of any Equity Sharing Agreement like that
which is in place in
respect of the Southport development".  In early August 1990 Mr Scanlan
enclosed a copy of the Equity Sharing
Agreement in his letter to EMM.  He in
fact signed the fourth and fifth Solicitors Certificates, neither of which
disclosed or referred
to the Equity Sharing Agreement.
<P>

414   	To my mind Mr Scanlan's conduct constituted a failure to
adhere to professional standards which involved express obligations
to disclose
particular facts in the matter of the subject Certificates.  This was not a
careless practice.  The continuance, following
the issue of the substitute
second Solicitors Certificate of the practices of:
<P>

(a)	omitting all reference to the Equity Sharing Agreements in correspondence
with BPTC;
<P>

(b)	overseeing the signing of, or himself signing, further Solicitors
Certificates which in each case omitted references to material
Equity Sharing
Agreements and to encumbrances on BPTC's property;
<P>

comprised a course of conduct which was discreditable as being at variance with
honourable dealing, which involved giving false
certifications, which was
deliberate and which followed a tangible suspicion gained on 28 November 1985
that something was amiss.
 The conduct amounted to `dishonesty' within the
meaning of the dishonesty exclusion.
<P>

As stated in <i>Schipp</i>, it seems to me that a failure to adhere to
professional standards will amount to dishonesty if the relevant standard or
standards,
involve an express obligation to attest the truthfulness of a
matter, to disclose a particular fact or otherwise to act honestly
in some
regard.
<P>

As stated in <i>Schipp</i> at paragraph 928, `Hunter J adopted a concept of
dishonesty in materially different terms to those which I [had] considered [in
the
preceding paragraphs to paragraph 928].
<P>

415   	I add that I do not see it as strictly necessary for me
to express a view as to Hunter J's requirement, as I understand his
Honour's
judgment, that to satisfy the `dishonesty exclusion', there be deliberate acts
or omissions as opposed to reckless or thoughtless
conduct.  To my mind, the
conduct of Mr Scanlan went beyond simple recklessness or thoughtlessness.
However, if it is necessary to
express a view on the issue then with the
greatest respect to the approach taken by Hunter J, I would not agree.
Reckless or thoughtless
conduct may, depending always on the precise
circumstances, enliven the `dishonesty exclusion'.  In the present
circumstances, Mr
Scanlan's conduct enlivened the exclusion clause.
<P>

416   	In the result, I accept as correct the Insurers'
submission that the Trustees' flow chart earlier set out, proceeds upon
the
misconceived basis that the questions of dishonesty and causation should be
addressed by referral to discrete acts or omissions
at the time of each of the
advances.  My finding is that the solicitors deliberately kept secret from
BPTC, or failed to disclose,
their knowledge or suspicion of the Lews'
financial involvement in the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions.  The non-disclosure
was a continuing
non-disclosure and occurred throughout the course of both PMA
1 and PMA 2 transactions.  The non-disclosure was not confined to the
occasions
when the various solicitors' certificates were provided to BPTC.  I accept as
correct the Insurers' submission that `dishonesty'
within the meaning of the
exclusion clause, may consist of `acts or omissions'.  My finding is that the
dishonesty, although evidenced
by the act of providing false certificates, was
not confined to those acts and that there was a continuing omission to
disclose.
<P>

417   	If, however, the Trustees' flow chart analysis be
required to be followed, then in my view and on my findings of fact, an
affirmative answer requires to be given to questions 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A and 5A.
The result on the `dishonesty exclusion' case is that
the Trustees cannot
recover in respect:
<P>

(a)	of the advance of $2,650,000 made on 14 November 1985;
<P>

(b)	of the further advance of $3,766,000 made on 28 November 1985;
<P>

(c)	of the advance of $951,460.44 made on 30 May 1986 or subsequent PMA 1
advances up to 20 October 1986;
<P>

(d)	PMA 1 advances subsequent to 20 October 1986;
<P>

(e)	PMA 2 advances.
<P>

418   	In the result, there never was at any stage any
disclosure to BPTC by Messrs Cleary or Scanlan of the terms or significance
of
the Equity Sharing Agreements or the financial involvement of the Lews in the
transactions.  That non-disclosure and the conduct
of Messrs Cleary and Scanlan
referred to above, constitutes dishonesty within the meaning of the relevant
exclusion clause.
<P>

419   	In light of the Court's findings that the dishonesty
exclusion was enlivened, it is strictly unnecessary to deal with the
further
defences of the Insurers.  In deference to the submissions, I propose to deal
with some, but not all, of those defences.
<P>

<b>Known Claims or Claims Circumstances - The Principles</b>
<P>

420   	The respective submissions going to `known claims or
claims circumstances' covered a number of issues.  The issue raised
during
final address when amendments to the pleadings were allowed and additional
cross-examination permitted, went to whether, in
relation to the known claims
or claims circumstances exclusion, there were one or several contracts of
insurance to which individual
partners were parties and to what was suggested
as being required to be known to each insured to enliven the `known claims or
claims
circumstances exclusion'.
<P>

421   	The Trustees' central submission is that in relation to
the known claims circumstances exclusion, the circumstances which
must be known
are those known to each assured.  Hence on the Trustees' submission, whether
there is one contract or several contracts,
there will nevertheless be several
insurances on any view of the matter so that if, on the proper construction of
the policy, the
circumstances must be known to the individual partners and if
the Court was to find that one partner, for example Mr Hoare, did not
have
knowledge of those circumstances, at for example 30 June 1990, or before, then
even if claims circumstances were known to other
partners, there is no
exclusion which affects Mr Hoare's several insurance.
<P>

422   	The Trustees accept that the question is initially one of
construction.
<P>

423   	If the Court was to accept the Trustees' submission as to
construction, then the Trustees assert that there may still be
a question as to
whether the knowledge of the individual partner was actual knowledge or whether
it might extend to knowledge which
it might be claimed should be imputed to
him, being the knowledge of another partner.
<P>

424   	To my mind, the convenient course is to examine these
aspects after first addressing issues which do not, at least in the
first
instance, require a treatment of the rights and obligations of, if there be
such, the individual insured under, if there be
such, several contracts.  The
structure of what follows will be :
<P>

(a)	An examination of the interrelationship of General Condition 4(b) and the
Special Condition.
<P>

(b)	An examination of the proper construction of General Condition 4(b).
<P>

(c)	An examination of the facts relevant to the `known claims and claims
circumstances' exclusion.
<P>

(d)	An examination of the `prior notification' case.
<P>

(e)	An examination of the `one contract/several contracts/circumstances known
to whom', issues. 
<P>

<b>The interrelationship of General Condition 4(b) and the Special
Condition</b>
<P>

425   	The special condition first appears in the excess
insurance Certificates for Year 2.  It is repeated in each of the excess
insurance certificates for Year 3.
<P>

426   	The excess insurance certificates incorporate the terms
of the applicable primary certificates `otherwise than as varied
herein' [see
for example PX1 Tab 13 Condition 3].  It follows that the special condition
relating to known claims or claims circumstances
requires to be construed in a
contractual context that includes, except in so far as they are varied, the
terms of the relevant primary
certificates.  Of particular relevance as
throwing light on the construction of the special condition relating to known
claims or
claims circumstances, are the insuring clauses (clause 2 and general
condition 4(b)).  Both parties accepted that it could safely
be assumed that
the reference to `known claims or claims circumstances' is a shorthand way of
referring to the subject matter of
clause 4(b):  that is to say, to a `claim
the subject of the Insuring Clauses made during the Period of Insurance against
the Assured'
or to `notice from any person of any intention to make a claim
against the Assured' or to `any circumstances of which the Assured
is or shall
become aware during the Period of Insurance which may give rise to a claim'.
The first of these would be a `known claim'.
 The third would be a `claims
circumstance'.  The second, depending upon its precise character, might be one
or the other.
<P>

427   	The insurers placed no reliance upon `known claims'.
[Transcript 316]
<P>

<b>The proper construction of General Condition 4(b)</b>
<P>

428   	In <i>FAI General Insurance Co Ltd v Australian Hospital
Care Pty Ltd</i> [Unreported, Supreme Court of Queensland, Court of Appeal, 9
July 1999] the Court dealt with the following policy condition:
<P>

<i>`If during the subsistence hereof the Insured shall </i><cite>become aware
of any occurrence which may subsequently give rise to a claim</cite><i> against
him or them for breach of professional duty by reason of any negligence,
whether by way of act, error or omission and shall
during the subsistence
hereof give written notice to the Company of such occurrence, then any such
claim which may subsequently be
made against the Insured arising out of such
negligence shall for the purposes of this Policy be deemed to have been made
during
the subsistence hereof.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

429   	Derrington J, with whose reasons on this issue Chesterman
J and Pincus JA agreed, said:
<P>

<i>`It is also correct that in order to come within the terms of [the]
condition . . ., the insured had to be aware of more than the
mere
circumstances forming the occurrence;  it had to be aware of the possibility of
a claim against itself for malpractice associated
with those circumstances.
However, again </i><cite>it did not have to be aware of</cite><i> how or why
this might be so, or </i><cite>whether the possible claim was justified or
might be expected to be successful</cite><i>.  The indemnity extended to its
costs of defending even an unsuccessful claim, so the general context supports
the construction </i><cite>excluding any need for belief as to the claim's
possibility of success</cite><i>.  This is also consistent with the ordinary
meaning of the condition's reference simply to any occurrence that may give
rise to a
claim, without any further unwarranted implication that the claim
should be justified or successful.  The degree of its possibility
required by
the term is not even qualified by any reference to reasonableness.</i>
<P>

<i>It is very likely that this construction was intended since the alternative
would have greatly reduced the practicality and value
of the cover.  In some
cases an insured may not know of the full circumstances on which the claim is
based until the statement of
claim is served.  This would be contrary to the
liberal construction that should be applied to such terms.  Alternatively, if
it
knows of an occurrence and knows very well that there is no valid basis for
a claim against it but that one may still be made, it
is of value to it that
the cover will apply to any such occasion;  and the provision as drafted in
this policy would provide that
cover.  That would be both intentional and
commercially reasonable.</i>
<P>

<i>In the present case, the representatives of the insured were not aware of
any fault on its part and did not expect a claim to be made,
but from the time
of notice of the solicitor's investigation they were aware of some possibility
of a claim for malpractice, irrespective
of whether or not it might be
justified.  They knew that somehow the patient had contracted septicaemia in
their hospital and that
his solicitor was investigating its cause, which of
course indicated at least the possibility that a claim for malpractice might
arise out of it.  This was sufficient to alert it as to the possibility of a
claim within the meaning of the term.  It might be contrasted
with the facts in
Della Vedova where the enquiry addressed to the insured was specifically
directed to a possible claim against the
insured's client without any
suggestion of fault on the part of the insured.'</i>
<P>

430   	To my mind there is, notwithstanding slight differences
in expression, no real difference between the condition dealt with
in FAI and
General Condition 4(b).  The reasoning of Derrington J is pervasive.  The
Insurers rely upon the proposition that there
were `claims circumstances' which
was a shorthand way of referring to `any circumstances of which the assured is
or shall become
aware during the Period of Insurance which may give rise to a
claim'.  I accept that an analysis of the condition requires that the
circumstances which are said to be known to the assured (i.e. of which the
"Assured is or shall become aware') are circumstances
`which may give rise to a
claim'.
<P>

431   	In <i>Pech v Tilgals</i> (1994) 94 ATC 4206 Dunford J
dealt with a claim by the plaintiff taxpayers against their accountant in
negligence arising out of
the alleged failure of the defendant to prepare and
submit accurate income tax returns on their behalf.  The defendant cross
claimed
seeking indemnity under a policy of insurance for any damages for which
he was liable.  The cross defendant insurer denied liability
relying on an
exclusion clause.
<P>

432   	The exclusion clause provided:
<P>

<i>`You are not covered under this Policy with respect to claims:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	. . .</i>
<P>

<i>	3.1	Made or threatened or in any way intimated before the commencement of
insurance cover under this Policy 1.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.2	Arising from any circumstance or </i><cite>circumstances of which You
shall become aware</cite><i>, prior to the commencement of insurance cover
under this Policy 1 and which a reasonable Accountant in Your position would at
any
time prior to the commencement of cover have considered may give rise to a
Claim or Claims.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

433   	Again the exclusion clause used words which are not in
precisely the same terms as those used in the present case.  Again
the
essential meaning is similar.  There was of course an additional rider to
clause 3.2, adding the objective element referable
to a reasonable accountant
in the insured's position.
<P>

434   	Dunford J said at p 4217, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`It is therefore necessary to consider what circumstances were known to the
insured prior to the commencement of the policy and to
then consider whether a
reasonable accountant in the position of the insured would have considered that
such circumstances may give
rise to a claim.  In my view the words `at any
time' (prior to the commencement of cover) do not embrace circumstances which
may
have existed some time previously but which have been overtaken by
subsequent events, as such a construction could at times lead
to absurd
results;  but refer rather to what the reasonable accountant should consider
right down to the commencement of cover. 
Moreover the hypothetical accountant
must not only be reasonable, but must also be placed in the position of the
insured, and this
includes his relationship with and knowledge of possible
claimants.</i>
<P>

<i>Finally, the issue is whether such circumstances MAY give rise to a claim as
opposed to whether they would, should or were considered
likely to give rise to
a claim, but the word does not include a bare theoretical possibility of a
claim.'</i>
<P>

435   	His Honour then set out certain findings of fact as to
matters of which the insured was aware and continued at p 4219:
<P>

<i>`Taking these matters into account, I believe that a reasonable accountant
in the position of the cross-claimant would not have expected
or anticipated
that a claim against him would or should be made;  </i><cite>but the
circumstances, including the sudden termination of his services, were such that
the possibility of a claim was not so remote
or fanciful that it could be
disregarded, and therefore he should have considered that a claim MAY be
made.</cite><i>'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

436   	Both parties in final submissions before me agreed with
the following proposition:
<P>

<i>`For circumstances to fall within the special condition, three things are
required:</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	the Assured must know - be or become aware - of the circumstances during
the period of insurance;</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	the circumstances must be such as to be capable of giving rise to a
claim;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	the knowledge or awareness of the Assured must encompass not only the
circumstances - ie the factual matters in question - but
their potential to
give rise to a claim.'</i>
<P>

437   	The Trustees submitted as follows:
<P>

<i>It cannot be enough that the Assured know of the circumstances, without also
knowing (or being aware) that those circumstances may
give rise to a claim.
[See the judgment of Derrington J in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court
of Queensland in FAI General
Insurance Co Limited v Australian Hospital Care
Pty Ltd (9902 of 1998, 9 July 1999 unreported) at paragraph 10; see also
Permanent
Trustee Australia Limited v FAI General Assurance Co Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20153%20ALR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)

Della Vedova (Full Federal Court, ACT AG80 of 1997, 15 April
1999 unreported).
The last two cases were relied upon and applied by Derrington J in the first
case.]</i>
<P>

<i>The Trustees accept that the operation of the special condition, in relation
to claims circumstances, does not require any evaluation
of the strength of the
claim or its justification or prospects of success.  [See Judgment of
Derrington J in FAI at para 10]  Nonetheless,
for the special condition to be
activated, it must be shown that the Assured had both knowledge of the
circumstances that are said
to have the potential to give rise to a claim and
knowledge that a claim might be made based on those circumstances.  Because the
special condition is predicated on knowledge, it must require an examination of
the actual knowledge of the Assured.  It is not to
the point to say that a
person in the position of the Assured "must have known".  Such considerations
will be relevant, if at all,
in assessing the credibility of the Assured's
evidence in relation to knowledge.  Thus, if an Assured denies knowledge and
the denial
is accepted, the "must have known" test ceases to have any further
application; specifically, it cannot be relied upon to fix the
Assured
objectively with knowledge which, it is accepted ex hypothesi, was
lacking.</i>
<P>

<b>General condition 4(b) - The Principles</b>
<P>

438   	The Trustees submitted and the Insurers accepted that the
principles as to what must be known in terms of satisfying General
Condition
4(b) were not relevantly different to the principles to be applied in respect
of the known claims and claims circumstances
special condition.
<P>

<b>Known claims and claims circumstances: The facts</b>
<P>

439   	It is unnecessary to repeat so much of the Judgment as
has already set out the sequence of events which occurred during the
period
between June 1990 and August 1990.  Mr Scanlan clearly became aware during his
examination on 19 June 1990 of circumstances
which were capable of giving rise
to a claim of the nature of that later pursued by the Trustees in the Cleary
and Hoare proceedings
No. 5870 of 1994.  His knowledge or awareness gained
during that examination clearly encompassed not only the factual matters in
question but also their potential to give rise to such claims.  Mr Scanlan's
awareness of these matters was heightened by the events
which occurred between
19 June 1990 and the end of August 1990, and most particularly by his further
examination on 27 July 1990,
by his knowledge that Mr Cleary was to be so
examined and by the issue of the warrants on 1 August 1990.
<P>

440   	It will be recalled that Mr Scanlan's evidence was that
the difficulties involving EMM by June 1990 and the investigation
of Messrs
Richard and Reuben Lew for criminal offences had been discussed with Mr
Scanlan's partners, and principally with Mr Cleary,
at the time.  Also that Mr
Scanlan's evidence was that when he was served the day after his first
examination with a further notice
to produce specifically files held in
relation to BPTC's advances on PMA 1 and PMA 2, he had informed <u>his
partners</u> about the production of the files.  His evidence was also that he
kept Mr Cleary closely informed about the sequence of events in
relation to his
examination.
<P>

441   	Mr Scanlan's evidence at transcript 23-24 included the
following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You told his Honour that it was likely that you did inform Mr Cleary
that there were allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty
in the
examination?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It is likely, yes</cite><i> that I did discuss it with Mr
Cleary. </i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And if that is likely, </i><cite>is it not also likely that you made it
clear to him that that would involve, if justified a civil
liability</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It's possible.  I cannot recall.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Possible or likely?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It's likely</cite><i>, but I just cannot recall.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Thank you.  Did Mr Cleary tell you that he was proposing to substantially
increase the firms professional indemnity cover?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He may have.  I can't recall.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Had the partnership discussed the need to increase the level of
professional indemnity cover in the light of the unfolding events
in relation
to the Estate Mortgage Trusts?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It is likely that it was discussed at the meetings, and
partners' meetings and whatever</cite><i>, but there was always a concern from
one of my partners, Mrs King, that there was just not enough insurance because
the firm had
expanded, grown.  We had opened a Sydney office.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	** And the discussion which you said was likely between the partnership
as to the need to increase the professional indemnity cover
in the light of the
unfolding events in relation to the Estate Mortgage Trust took place, did it
not, because of the possibility
of a civil claim arising from those events
which may be greater than the then current level of cover?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There was a </i><cite>general concern in the office about the way that
the estate mortgage matters had transpired, what had happened</cite><i>.  Mr
Lew and Richard had been charged, and there was just a general concern about
it.  But in our view, in my view, I believed that
we did everything right and
proper and once everything had been looked at and analysed that they would find
that there would be no
problem.</i>
<P>

<i>(** Question marked read back.)</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would say </i><cite>it's more than likely that was a matter that was in
the mind of certain partners</cite><i> and may have been addressed at a
partner's meeting.  I simply can't recall.'</i>
<P>

442   	This evidence is consistent with Mr Cleary's evidence
that it was likely that there was discussion amongst the partners in
relation
to the notice served on Mr Scanlan on 14 June 1990 to attend to give evidence
before the NCSC  The evidence of a system
with a subcommittee of partners
reporting to partners meetings is also consistent with the ability of those
seeking to do so to quickly
convene formal or informal partners meetings to
approve an urgent increase in cover.
<P>

443   	To my mind, the circumstance that Cleary and Hoare sought
quotations for top up cover of $5million, $7.5million and $10million
by
facsimile on 22 June 1990 (DX volume 6 p 15) serves to confirm the Court's
further finding of fact that on the probabilities the
firm Cleary &amp; Hoare,
by all of its partners, had become aware by 22 June 1990 of the existence of
circumstances which were capable
of giving rise to a claim of the nature of the
claim later pursued by the Trustees in the Cleary and Hoare proceedings 5870 of
1994.
 Likewise the circumstance that Cleary &amp; Hoare sought quotations for
additional cover to limits of $20million, $30million and
$40million on 30 July
1990 (see DX volume 6 p 43 referring to a telephone request), serves to confirm
the Court's further finding
of fact that by late July 1990 and following the
further examinations of Messrs Cleary and Scanlan, the firm by its partners
were
extremely concerned as to the firm's potential liability on claims of the
nature of the claim later pursued by the Trustees in the
Cleary and Hoare
proceedings.
<P>

444   	Without being exhaustive in terms of repeating the
factual findings and recitation of evidence earlier set out in this Judgment,
prior to 30 June 1990, there existed `known claim circumstances' in the sense
of `circumstances which may give rise to a claim' which
included:
<P>

(a)	The fact that against a background in which in 1987 and 1988 PMA 1 and PMA
2 had defaulted on their loans from BPTC.  Receivers
had been appointed to PMA
1 and PMA 2.  BPTC had not recovered its principal and interest advanced, in
April 1990 the Estate Mortgage
Trusts had collapsed amid extensive
publicity.
<P>

(b)	In June 1990 the NCSC had commenced an investigation into the affairs of
EMM and had served a notice on Mr Scanlan to attend
and be examined.
<P>

(c)	On 19 June 1990 Mr Scanlan had been examined by the NCSC.  Detail of the
examination has already been referred to.  The examination
on my findings,
exposed and explored in a very direct manner allegations of concealment,
dishonesty and breach of duty by Mr Scanlan
in connection with the PMA 1 and
PMA 2 transactions.
<P>

(d)	On 19 June 1990 the NCSC issued a notice to produce to Mr Scanlan for
documents relating to the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions.
<P>

(e)	On 22 June 1990 Messrs Reuben Lew and Richard Lew were arrested and
charged.  This caused concern amongst Mr Scanlan and his
partners [transcript
31].
<P>

(f)	There was a developing concern as events unfolded from April through May
and through to June 1990 about the fact of what was
happening with Estate
Mortgage [transcript 34].  The concern developed in the context of the firm's
<u>level of cover with particular focus</u> following the specific allegations
of a possible breach of duty put to Mr Scanlan in his examination of 19 June
[transcript 35].
<P>

445   	In relation to the suggested divide between circumstances
known to Mr Scanlan prior to 30 June 1990 and circumstances known
to him during
July and August 1990, my finding is that by 30 June 1990, Mr Scanlan had become
aware of circumstances which were clearly
capable of giving rise to a claim of
the nature of the claim later pursued by the Trustees in the Cleary &amp; Hoare
proceedings.
 The later NCSC examination of late July 1990 simply served to
emphasise and confirm what must have been, on my findings, quite plain
after
the initial examination, namely that circumstances clearly put to Mr Scanlan in
his first examination made him aware as a matter
of fact of the possibility of
a claim against himself and his firm of the nature of the claim later pursued
by the Trustees in the
Cleary &amp; Hoare proceedings.
<P>

446   	As I accept Justice Derrington's formulation of what was
required, it was not necessary in order to satisfy the exclusion
clause for any
belief by Mr Scanlan as to the possibility of success of such a claim against
his firm.  That having been said, my
finding of fact is that Mr Scanlan prior
to 30 June 1990 had been made aware, particularly during the course of the NCSC
investigation
and examination of himself, that the possibility of a civil claim
against his firm was neither remote nor fanciful.
<P>

<b>Year 3 - `Prior Notification' under the Year 2 Policy question</b>
<P>

447   	The Insurers prepared in final submissions a convenient
synopsis comparing relevant parameters of the subject charges to
be found at DX
1 page 48 as against the paragraphs in proceedings 1802 of 1991 and the later
proceedings 5870 of 1994.  The schedule
is appended to the Judgment as Appendix
8.  It is, inter alia, relied upon by the Insurers as part of their Year 3
`prior notification'
case.  -  See insuring clause 2 where, on the Insurers'
submissions which I accept, what is required involves two steps namely:
<P>

i.	Circumstances or an occurrence which has been notified and
<P>

ii.	Whether the loss (here the judgments) arose out of the circumstances
notified.
<P>

448   	I accept the Insurers' submission that the second of
these steps raises an objective test.
<P>

449   	I accept the Insurers' submission that the insuring
clause excludes cover for claims `arising out of' circumstances previously
notified.  I accept as correct the Insurers' further written submissions in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>`The "circumstances" notified on 7 August 1990 included the fact of the
criminal charges against Cleary and Scanlan including the
terms of those
charges and the underlying facts on which they were expressly based.  Scanlan
accepted at T45-46 that the description
of the events forming the basis of the
charges served on 1 August 1990, was a description of the same underlying facts
which were
the subject of his 19 June examination and were also substantially
the same facts as later became the subject of the civil proceedings
commenced
against the firm.  An objective assessment of the facts alleged in the charges,
compared with the facts alleged in the
Statement of Claim issued on 22 October
1991 (served on 5 May 1992) and which, after amendment, became the Further
Amended Statement
of Claim in the Victorian proceedings, demonstrates the
relevant correlation and identicality of the facts in each case.  . . .</i>
<P>

<i>The essential circumstances the subject of the criminal charges were later
reflected in the proceedings commenced by the Trustees,
initially as
proceedings No. 1802 in Queensland which later became proceedings No. 5870 of
1994 in Victoria.</i>
<P>

<i>The essence of the criminal charges (relating to PMA1) is that Cleary and
Scanlan assisted Lew/Welstbarrd to obtain a 50% share in
the net profits of
PMA1's Southport project in return for Lew agreeing to obtain for PMA1 a
$20million loan from BPTC to develop
the property.  The 50% share was kept
secret: see DX1 Vol 6 p.49.  The Yossarian charges are similar.</i>
<P>

<i>These allegations lie at the heart of the subsequent civil
proceedings.'</i>
<P>

450   	For reasons already clear, it is ultimately not necessary
to decide the issues between the Insurers and the Trustees on the
artificial
basis that the only circumstance of relevance is the Year 3 `Prior
Notification' defence.  Had this been the case, then
on the Trustees'
submissions, the 7 August 1990 notification, being the notification of charges
relating to secret commissions, was
<u>not</u> a notification of the
circumstances that gave rise to the later claims made by the Trustees.  On the
Trustees' case, it is said not
to have been an essential ingredient of those
charges - as it was for the Trustees' claims - that Cleary &amp; Hoare were
retained
on behalf of, and owed fiduciary duties to, BPTC.   The Trustees' case
is that their claims were not premised upon, nor did they
assume as a necessary
factual underpinning, any arrangement in relation to secret commissions.  Their
case is that the Trustee did
not allege that Cleary &amp; Hoare were parties to
some illegal transaction, the aim and result of which was to persuade Estate
Mortgage
Managers to make a corrupt recommendation not for the benefit of the
Trusts but for its own benefit.  Instead, so the Trustees assert,
it was
alleged that Cleary &amp; Hoare had placed themselves in a position of conflict
arising out of their acting for both BPTC
and Weltsbarrd and Yossarian.
<P>

451   	Hence, on the Trustees' case at the widest level, the
notification of 7 August 1990 was the laying of criminal charges. 
The
Trustees' case is that their claims do not arise out of those charges. 
<P>

452   	In that fashion, the Trustees submit that if one looked
at the detail of the charges and compared them with the details of
the
Trustees' claims (for example, relating to PMA 1), the lack of congruity was
plain.  Here, the Trustees sought to identify the
detail of the respective
charges and Trustees' claims in the following terms:
<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

453   	The Insurers in turn prepared a schedule to point up the
allegations and matters common to the changes and the relevant pleadings.
 This
schedule is appended to the Judgment and more accurately identifies the common
elements.
<P>

454   	To my mind, the Trustees' recording of the essence of the
charge and the pleadings is essentially misleading in this context.
 The 7
August 1990 notification was, in my view, a notification of the circumstances
which gave rise in due course to the civil proceedings.
 In the result the
Court's holding in relation to the application of the known claims
circumstances exclusion qua the Year 3 policy,
is that there was a prior
notification under the Year 2 policy.
<P>

455   	As also already made clear, in my view, the heart of the
civil proceedings involved allegations going to facts, the description
of which
were essentially the same as those which had been, at least in part,  the
subject of Mr Scanlan's 19 June examination.
<P>

<b>The `one contract/several contracts/circumstances known to whom?
issues</b>
<P>

456   	Extensive submissions were addressed by both parties on a
range of issues related to the subject insurance contracts furnishing
basic or
compulsory cover of $500,000 and furnishing excess (non compulsory) cover.
<P>

457   	The first matter in issue went to questions:
<P>

(a)	As to the identification of the parties to the several contracts of
insurance.
<P>

(b)	As to who were the insured under the relevant contracts.
<P>

458   	Other matters in issue went to questions of the proper
construction of the `known claims or claims circumstances' terms.
 As already
indicated, the particular focus of these issues went to whether individual
partners were severally insured and as to
whether, upon the proper construction
of the subject contracts, an insured partner would be affected by `known claims
or claims circumstances'
not known to him or her but known to another
partner.
<P>

459   	The Trustees asserted that the relevant contracts of
insurance were made:
<P>

1.	For Year 1, by way of three separate contracts:  between Mr Cleary and the
relevant Insurers, Mr Hoare and the relevant Insurers
and Mr Isles and the
relevant Insurers;
<P>

2.	For Year 2 and Year 3, by way of two separate contracts:  between Mr Cleary
and the relevant Insurers and Mr Hoare and the relevant
Insurers;
<P>

3.	Alternatively, for each year, by way of one contract between the firm Cleary
&amp; Hoare on the one part and the relevant Insurers
on the other under which
(for Year 1) Messrs Cleary, Hoare and Isles were severally insured and (for
Years 2 and 3) Messrs Cleary
and Hoare were severally insured, in each case
with separate certificates issued to them;  and
<P>

4.	For Years 2 and 3, although Mr Isles was no longer a partner and there was
no separate certificate of insurance issued to him,
he is said to have been
entitled to be indemnified under the relevant contracts of insurance as though
a certificate had been issued
to him.  [This entitlement is said to arise under
the relevant Master Policy or Master Contract pursuant to which the individual
certificates of insurance were issued.  It is put that Mr Isles would be
entitled to enforce the right to indemnity on the principles
laid down by the
High Court in <i>Trident General Insurance Co Limited v McNiece Bros Pty
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 107.]</a>
<P>

460   	The Trustees' submissions were put in two tranches which
overlapped - the first proffered by Mr McDougall QC and Mr Powell
until Mr
McDougall's departure from the case, and the second proffered by Mr White SC
and Mr Powell, Mr White having taken over as
leading counsel for the
Trustees.
<P>

461   	The respective submissions were as follows:
<P>

<b>Initial Submissions 23 August 1999</b>
<P>

<i>`The structure of Cleary &amp; Hoare's (ie, Messrs Cleary's, Hoare's and
Isles' . . .)  insurance arrangements is in substance the
same for each of
Years 1, 2 and 3.  That structure consists of:</i>
<P>

<i>i.	a Memorandum of Agreement establishing a professional indemnity insurance
scheme for the Queensland Law Society Incorporated (the
"Society") (the
evidentiary references are given in the next subparagraph).  It should be noted
that the Memorandum of Agreement
authorises firstly the issue of a master
policy to the Society and secondly the issue by the "Coverholder" of
"individual Professional
Indemnity Certificates of Insurance ... to Solicitors
... who are required to be insured" by certain statutory rules;</i>
<P>

<i>ii.	the statutory rules in question are the Indemnity Rules of the
Queensland Law Society Incorporated (the "Indemnity Rules").  The
Indemnity
Rules were made by order of 21 May 1987 published in the Queensland Government
Gazette on 23 May 1997.  The Rules were
amended by order in counsel made on 31
May 1990 gazetted on 2 June 1990;</i>
<P>

<i>iii.	the effect of the Indemnity Rules, both as originally gazetted and as
amended, is to require every "practising practitioner to
whom these rules
apply" to take out indemnity insurance.  The rules apply to "every solicitor or
conveyancer who is, or is held out
to the public as a principal in private
practice in Queensland" (amended in 1990 by deleting the reference to
"solicitor or conveyancer"
and substituting "practising practitioner").  In
other words, partners in firms were required to be insured pursuant to separate
certificates of insurance;</i>
<P>

<i>iv.	a Master Policy made between certain insurers and the Society on behalf
of solicitors and conveyancers who are required to be
insured.  [See PX1 volume
1 tab 2 (Agreement and Master Policy for Year 1); tab 9 (Agreement and Master
Policy for Year 2); tab 18
(Agreement and Master Policy for Year 3).]  Note
that the Master Policy by clause 1 contains an agreement between the insurers
thereto
and the Society "on behalf of all solicitors ... who may from time to
time be required to be insured" by the Indemnity Rules;</i>
<P>

<i>v.	certificates of insurance for the basic (compulsory) cover of $500,000
[See exhibit PX1 volume 1 tab 3 (Year 1); tab 10 (Year 2);
tab 19 (Year 3).]
It is clear for Year 2 and Year 3 that the certificates are issued to
individual partners so that there is one
certificate of insurance for the
primary layer for each partner.  Although the certificates for Year 1 do not
name the individual
partners, there are nine individual, separately numbered
certificates.  The proposal form [DX vol 6 p 28] shows that the person who
assessed the number of partners ascertained (wrongly) that there were eleven;
presumably, since two of those partners were described
as "NSW only", separate
certificates of insurance were not issued for those "NSW only" partners.  In
any event, given that there
are nine concurrent separately numbered
certificates, the proper inference is that, consistent with the terms of the
Indemnity Rules,
the Memorandum of Agreement and the Master Policy, separate
certificates of insurance were issued for each partner as was done explicitly
in Year 2 and Year 3; and</i>
<P>

<i>vi.	certificates of insurance for such excess (non-compulsory) insurance as
might be arranged [See exhibit PX1 volume 1 tabs 4 to
8 (Year 1);  tabs 11 to
16 (Year 2);  tabs 20 to 26 (Year 3).]  Unlike the basic cover, the
certificates for excess cover were not
issued in favour of individual partners.
However, as is explained in paragraph 8 below, the excess insurance
incorporated the terms
of the primary certificates of insurance.</i>
<P>

<i>The result, in the Trustees' submission, is that there were individual
contracts of primary insurance for each partner, evidenced
by the terms of the
certificate issued (expressly in Years 2 and 3 and by implication in Year 1) to
each partner individually.  That
this is so is confirmed by the wording of
paragraph (b) of the proviso to clause 2 (the "Insuring Clauses") referring to
"this Certificate
of Insurance and all other Certificates of Insurance".  It is
also confirmed by the definition in clause 1(a) of "The Assured" and
the
provision therein for several insurance.</i>
<P>

<i>The insurance scheme in place for each year in question included a
compulsory element - the basic cover of $500,000 each claim which
every sole
practitioner or firm was required to have in place; and a voluntary component -
whatever excess insurance (if any) practitioners
or firms thought fit to
arrange.  For obvious reasons, it was necessary that if excess insurance were
taken out, it should be on
terms relevantly identical to the terms of the
compulsory primary insurance.  With the exception of the "known claims or
claims circumstances"
condition [which first appeared in the certificates for
Year 2: see exhibit PX1 volume 1 tab 13] this was effectively achieved. 
Thus,
the certificates for excess insurance in each year incorporated the relevant
provisions of the primary cover.</i>
<P>

<i>Because the terms of the certificates of insurance did not relevantly change
from year to year (with the exception already noted as
to naming individual
partners), it is convenient to look at one only.  These submissions will refer
to the first of the certificates
of insurance for Year 1 [PX vol 1 tab 3], but
they apply equally to the certificates of insurance for the following
years.</i>
<P>

<i>The first important clause is the insuring clause: clause 2.  It
reads:</i>
<P>

<i>[the clause is then set out]</i>
<P>

<i>Clause 3 is significant.  It provides as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>"3.	Special Conditions:</i>
<P>

<i>a.  Subject to General Condition (f) the Insurers will not:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	seek to avoid, repudiate or rescind this insurance upon any ground
whatsoever, including in particular non-disclosure or misrepresentation;</i>
<P>

<i>2.	reject or reduce the quantum of any claim because of any non-disclosure
or misrepresentation.</i>
<P>

<i>b.  Where the Assured's breach of or non-compliance with any condition of
this insurance has resulted in substantial prejudice to
the handling or
settlement of any claim against the Assured in respect of which the Assured is
insured hereunder the Assured shall
reimburse to the Insurers the appropriate
sum by which the Insurers have been prejudiced.  Provided always that it shall
be a condition
preceded of the right of Insurers to seek such reimbursement
that they shall have fully indemnified the Assured in accordance with
the terms
hereof.</i>
<P>

<i>[Clauses 4(b) and 5(e)(v) are then set out.]</i>
<P>

<i>In clause 1(a) the expression "</i>The Assured<i>" is defined to
mean:</i>
<P>

<i>`...the Firm and each Partner in the Firm or the Sole Practitioner as the
case may be shown in the Schedule and includes any person
employed in
connection with the Practice (including each articled clerk, and each solicitor
or conveyancer who is a Consultant or
Associate with the Firm) and the estate
and/or the legal representatives of any of the foregoing, and also includes
each service
or administration company or trust insofar as its activities are
carried out in connection with the Practice to the intent that each
of the
foregoing shall be severally insured hereunder.'</i>
<P>

<i>In each certificate the name of the Firm is given as Cleary &amp;
Hoare.</i>
<P>

<i>Because the terms of each year's certificates of insurance for the primary,
or compulsory level are incorporated into any excess insurance,
the terms of
those certificates of insurance, on their proper construction, will govern not
only the primary cover but also any excess
cover [except to the extent that the
primary terms are varied in any certificate of excess insurance: see clause 3
of the Certificate
of Insurance for Excess Cover for, for example, the 1989
year (there is no relevant variation for later years) at exhibit PX1 volume
1
tab 6.  In other words, notwithstanding that the primary layer of cover is
compulsory whereas the excess layers are not, the terms
of the primary cover
will, unless varied, apply in respect of the excess cover.</i>
<P>

<i>The nature of the contracts of insurance effected on the terms of the
primary certificates is self evident.  They are several (as
clause 1(a) makes
clear) insurances against loss arising from any claim in respect of any
description of civil liability whatsoever
incurred in connection with the
Assured's practice as a solicitor: see clause 2(a).  The description of "loss
to the Assured" in
the insuring clause is not limited to defined categories of
loss: on the contrary, it uses the widest possible words to describe
both the
kind and the source of insured loss.  It was self evident, at the time each of
the contracts of insurance was made, that
insured solicitors might incur civil
liability for a variety of reasons: including, but not limited to, breach of
contract, breach
of fiduciary duty and negligence.  It must have been the
intention of the parties to the contracts of insurance that, subject to
the
terms of the certificate, any liability arising from any of these causes and
otherwise falling within the terms of the insuring
clause would attract a right
of indemnity in accordance with the terms of the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>The objects of the contracts are likewise clear.  They include an intention
to provide indemnity to solicitors for claims made against
them in connection
with their practice.  Importantly, and arising from the compulsory nature of
the insurances at the primary level,
the objects must be taken to include the
wider object of providing a degree of protection, and in a more general sense
comfort, to
clients of solicitors.  The compulsory aspect of the scheme was
clearly intended to ensure that there would be a fund available so
that clients
of negligent (etc) solicitors who suffered loss would not remain uncompensated
in the event that their solicitor might
not have the resources to satisfy a
judgment in respect of that loss.  The public interest aspect of the scheme is
clearly reflected
in clause 3(a), whereby the Insurers give away their common
law and statutory right to avoid, repudiate or rescind on grounds including
non-disclosure and misrepresentation.  That this provision, although on its
face beneficial to the solicitor as well as the client,
is included
specifically for the benefit of the client is made clear by clause 3(b).  In
other words, a solicitor guilty of non-disclosure
or misrepresentation remains
entitled to the benefit of the insurance (so that the solicitor's client will
not suffer) but is liable
to indemnify the insurer for any prejudice (so that
the insurer will not suffer).  Importantly, the insurer must pay out before
recovering
from the solicitor.'</i>
<P>

<b>Supplementary Submissions - 1 September 1999</b>
<P>

<i>`There is a number of indicia of separate contracts of insurance.  These
include:</i>
<P>

<i>6.1	the terms of the statutory scheme, established under the Queensland Law
Society Act 1952 and the Indemnity Rules made pursuant
to that Act (note that
under the Act rules made pursuant to section 5, upon publication in the
Gazette, "have the same force and
effect as if they were embraced in and formed
part of this Act".)</i>
<P>

<i>6.2	The terms of the Master Policies or Master Contracts pursuant to which
the contracts of insurance were effected from year to year.
 Thus, for Year 1,
clause 1 of the Master Policy provides:</i>
<P>

<i>"The Insurers agree with the Queensland Law Society Incorporated ... on
behalf of all solicitors ... who may from time to time be
required to be
insured by [the] Indemnity Rules ... and former solicitors ... to provide such
insurance in accordance with the terms
of the Certificate of Insurance attached
hereto.  Subject as hereinafter appears in respect of former practitioners,
such Certificates
of Insurance shall be issued on receipt of the premium
payable ...".</i>
<P>

<i>By clause 3, a rate of premium is prescribed per sole practitioner or
partner.  By clause 6, former practitioners are accorded a right
of indemnity
without payment of premium and without issue of a Certificate of Insurance "as
if a Certificate of Insurance in the
terms attached hereto had been issued
...".  By clause 7, authority is given to Minet International Professional
Indemnity Limited
or The Queensland Law Society Incorporated "to issue on
behalf of the Insurers to Practitioners seeking Insurance ... Certificates
of
Insurance in the form attached hereto".</i>
<P>

<i>6.3.	The terms of the Certificates of Insurance themselves:  although for
Year 1 the Certificates do not name individual partners,
the fact is that some
eight certificates were issued each specifying a premium which, by reference to
the Indemnity Rules and the
Master Policy, must have been a premium payable in
respect of individual partners.  For Years 2 and 3, the Certificates were
issued
specifically in favour of the partner named therein.  The terms of the
Certificate distinguish between "the Assured" on the one hand
and "the Firm" on
the other.  Although the "Assured" includes the "Firm" it also includes each
partner in the firm and a number of
other persons, "to the intent that each of
the foregoing shall be severally insured hereunder".  The provisions of clause
2 are also
relevant.  Clause 2(a) refers to claims "against one or more
Assured".  Clause 29b) deals with aggregation of liability "under the
Certificate of Insurance and all other Certificates of Insurance issued under
the Master Policy in respect of all claims arising
from the same act or
omission".  Both subclauses are consistent with the existence of individual
contracts.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	The scheme thus established is of a Master Policy, to which the
Queensland Law Society Incorporated and certain insurers were,
but firms of
solicitors and individual solicitors were not, parties under which individual
Certificates are issued to individual
practitioners (in conformity with the
statutory requirements) upon payment of individual premiums.  Whether or not
such Certificates
are issued, as a matter of convenience, upon application made
by or on behalf of partners through their firm, the objective circumstances,
fortified by the reference to "several insurance", are consistent with the
existence of individual contracts of insurance between
individual practitioners
on the one hand and the Insurers on the other.  For Years 2 and 3, the evidence
shows that the only certificates
issued were certificates which named
individual practitioners and the firm (if any) of which they were members.  For
Year 1, the
schedule did not make provision for the naming of individual
practitioners.</i>
<P>

<i>8.	The alternative proposition must be that even if there is but one policy,
between the firm on the one hand and the Insurers on
the other (notwithstanding
the payment of individual premiums and the issue of individual certificates)
then nonetheless that policy
was a composite contract of insurance under which
each partner was severally insured, and the expression "the Assured" is to be
construed
having regard to the separate certificates.</i>
<P>

<i>	This alternative analysis is consistent with the decision of the Full Court
of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Gilmore &amp;
Ors v AMP General

<b>Gilmore's Case</b>
<P>

462   	In <i>Gilmore v AMP General Insurance Co Limited</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2067%20SASR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 67 SASR 387</a>, the South Australian Full Court dealt with the question of
whether an innocent insured was entitled to indemnity notwithstanding
that the
indemnity was sought for loss arising out of a claim brought about by the
dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of another
partner.
<P>

463   	The plaintiffs were or had been partners in a firm of
solicitors during a period in which S also had also been a partner.
 The
parties agreed for the purposes of the proceedings that S whilst a partner of
the firm had engaged in conduct amounting to `dishonest
acts or omissions',
there being a dispute between the plaintiffs and the insurers with whom each of
the plaintiffs had taken out
professional indemnity insurance as to whether or
not in such circumstances the plaintiffs were entitled to be indemnified by the
insurers in respect of claims made by clients against the plaintiffs in respect
of the default of S.  The insurers operated a scheme
of insurance known as the
`compulsory professional indemnity insurance scheme of the Law Society of New
South Australia'.
<P>

464   	The firm in question had been called `Fisher Jeffries
&amp; Co' and subsequently `Fisher Jeffries'.
<P>

465   	Leave to state a case to the Full Court asked the
following question:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Are the insurers entitled to deny indemnity to the plaintiffs in respect
of any loss arising out of the Gill and Upton claims
pursuant to clause
5(d)(iii) of the Certificates of Insurance by reason of the dishonest acts or
omissions of S in circumstances
where the plaintiffs were partners of S, were
not guilty of any dishonest acts or omissions themselves, and were not aware of
and
did not acquiesce in and were not parties to the commission of any
dishonest acts or omissions by S?'</i>
<P>

466   	Cox J with whose reasons and answer to the case Mathieson
J agreed, and with whose answer to the case Duggan J agreed and
with whose
reasons Duggan J also agreed although adding to those reasons his own comments,
set out the relevant clauses and the background
statutory insurance scheme as
follows:
<P>

<i>`<b>The statutory insurance scheme</b></i>
<P>

<i>Section 52 of the Legal Practitioners Act provides that the Law Society may,
with the approval of the Attorney-General, establish
a scheme providing
professional indemnity insurance, to an extent provided by the scheme, for the
benefit of legal practitioners.
 By "professional indemnity insurance" is meant
insurance against inter alia "civil liability arising in connection with legal
practice
(whether the liability arose from an act or omission on the part of
the insured legal practitioner or some other person)".  The scheme
is to be
promulgated in the form of regulations.  It is to have the force of law and be
binding on the legal practitioners who are
covered by it.  A scheme was duly
devised and it is embodied in the Legal Practitioners (Professional Indemnity
Insurance Scheme)
Regulations 1987 (SA) as amended from time to time.
Certificates of insurance in the form provided by the regulations were issued
to practitioners in accordance with the professional indemnity insurance master
policy.  It was a "claims made" policy and it appears
that the two former
clients gave notice of their respective claims in 1992.  By that time Miss
Gilmore had retired from practice
but she was still effectively insured in all
relevant respects because cl 5 of the master policy provides that a former
practitioner
is entitled to be indemnified as if a certificate of insurance had
been issued and was in force at the relevant time.  Three of the
partners had
by then left Fisher Jeffries, one to practise on his own account and the others
to join other firms.  Each of the plaintiffs
except Miss Gilmore held in 1992 a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form.  The schedule to Mr Blue's
certificate, which
will serve as an example in the case of the continuing
members of Fisher Jeffries, sets out particulars special to Mr Blue's policy
-
the period of insurance, the sum insured, the premium and so on - and one of
the boxes near the top of the schedule contains the
following information
-</i>
<P>

<i>"The Practitioner:  Malcolm Fraser Blue</i>
<P>

<i>Name of the Firm/Company Practitioner:  Fisher Jeffries."</i>
<P>

<i>In the case of Mr Fisher, who left Fisher Jeffries in 1988, the particulars
read:</i>
<P>

<i>"The practitioner:  Peter George Robert Fisher</i>
<P>

<i>Name of the Firm/Company Practitioner:  Norman Waterhouse."</i>
<P>

<i>Another box in Mr Blue's schedule states:  "Sum insured $750 000 each
claim."</i>
<P>

<i>Certain clauses in the certificate of insurance are relevant to the present
question.  Clause 1 (Interpretation) includes the following:</i>
<P>

<i>"In this Certificate of Insurance unless the context otherwise
requires:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	`the Practitioner' means the person or company named as such in the
Schedule;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	`the Assured' means:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the Practitioner, the Firm and each Partner thereof or the sole
Practitioner or the Company Practitioner and each Director holding
a current
practising certificate of the Company Practitioner as the case may be shown in
the Schedule,</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	each person employed in connection with the Practice (including each
articled clerk) and each practitioner who is a Consultant
or Associate with the
Practitioner, the Firm or the Company Practitioner,</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	the estate and/or the legal representatives of each of the foregoing,
and</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	each service or administration or nominee company or trust insofar as
its activities are carried out in connection with the Practice</i>
<P>

<i>to the intent that each of the foregoing shall be severally insured
hereunder;   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	`the Firm' means the firm as from time to time constituted in which the
Practitioner is practising and includes a sole practice;</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	`the Company Practitioner' means the incorporated practice as from time
to time constituted in which the Practitioner is practising;</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	`Partner' includes any Practitioner held out by the Firm as a partner in
the Firm;</i>
<P>

<i>. . .'</i>
<P>

<i>Other relevant provisions of the certificate are:</i>
<P>

<i>"2.	Insuring Clauses</i>
<P>

<i>On the terms and the conditions herein contained the insurers shall
indemnify the Assured up to an amount not exceeding the Sum Insured
and Related
Costs against all loss to the Assured (including claimants' costs) whensoever
ocurring [sic] arising from any claim or
claims first made against the Assured
during the Period of Insurance in respect of any description of civil liability
whatsoever
incurred in connection with the Practice other than loss arising out
of any circumstance or occurrence which has been notified under
any other
insurance attaching prior to the inception of this Certificate of Insurance
provided that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	for the purposes hereof all claims arising from the same act or
omission, whether made against one or more Assured, shall be regarded
as one
claim;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the liability of the Insurers under this Certificate of Insurance and
all other Certificates of Insurance issued under the Master
Policy in respect
of all claims arising from the same act or omission shall not exceed the Sum
Insured and Related Costs.</i>
<P>

<i>. . .</i>
<P>

<i>5.	General Exclusions</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Subject to 5(b) hereof this insurance shall be subject to a Deductible
of $50,000.</i>
<P>

<i>. . .</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	This insurance shall not indemnify the Assured in respect of any loss
arising out of any claim:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	for death, bodily injury, physical loss of or physical damage to
property of any kind whatsoever (other than property in the care,
custody and
control of the Assured in connection with the Practice for which they are
responsible, not being property occupied or
used by the Assured for the
purposes of the Practice);</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	for the payment of any trading debt incurred by the Assured.</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	brought about by the dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of
</i><cite>the Assured</cite><i>, save that this Exclusion shall not apply to
liability arising out of any claim brought about by the dishonest or fraudulent
act
or omission of any person employed in connection with the Practice (other
than a Director) including any articled clerk, consultant
or associate."</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

467   	Cox J then went on to deal with the interpretation
question and, having identified the question, considered the general rules
applicable to an insurance policy of that kind when one of two co-insured
persons deliberately caused loss as by his own fraudulent
conduct and his
partner, not involved in the fraud in any way, made a claim on the insurance
company.
<P>

468   	The interpretation question was identified as follows:
<P>

<i>`<b>The interpretation question</b></i>
<P>

<i>What is in issue in the case stated is the correct interpretation and
application of the expression "the Assured" in subpar (d)(iii)
of the exclusion
clause.  The plaintiffs say that this refers only to the individual
practitioner named in the Schedule - in the
case of Mr Blue, for instance, it
refers only to Mr Blue himself.  The defendant says that "the Assured" in
subpar (d)(iii) must
be interpreted in the light of cl 1 and thus, in Mr Blue's
case, signifies Mr Blue and Fisher Jeffries and each of its partners.</i>
<P>

<i>As a matter of documentary interpretation there is obviously much to be said
for the defendant's submission.  The purpose of a definition
clause is to
streamline and save space, and one would normally expect to interpret "the
Assured" in subpar (d)(iii) as though the
whole of the cl 1 definition were
incorporated into the subparagraph itself.  The relevant part of the definition
speaks of "the
Practitioner, the Firm and each Partner thereof" and this would
seem, at least at first sight, in the case of Mr Blue, to bring in
Fisher
Jeffries and all of the members of the firm as well - indeed, in accordance
with the definition of "Partner", would extend
to any practitioner held out as
a partner.  However, Mr Gray QC, for the plaintiffs, submitted that the
position is not as simple
as that.'</i>
<P>

469   	In considering the general rules and the case law, Cox J
noted that the Law Society Master Policy acknowledges that the rights
and
interests of any co-insured persons may not be the same.  His Honour pointed
out that clause 1 provided expressly that the persons
or bodies constituting
`the assured' are insured severally.  His Honour then continued:
<P>

<i>`Clause 1 provides expressly that the persons or bodies constituting "the
Assured" are insured severally.  The insurer thus undertakes
separate and
distinct obligations to the co-insured:  see General Accident Fire &amp; Life
Assurance Corporation Ltd v Midland Bank
Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%202%20KB%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] 2 KB 388</a> at 405-405.  In
Federation Insurance Ltd v Wasson <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20163%20CLR%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 163 CLR 303</a> it was held that this form
of insurance could have a critical bearing upon the respective rights and
obligations of the insurer and
the insured - in that case, the ability of one
co-insured to terminate the policy unilaterally.  In Lombard Australia Ltd v
NRMA
Insurance Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%2072%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 72 SR (NSW) 45</a> it was held by the Court of Appeal of
New South Wales that, in the case of such a composite policy, a hire-purchase
company was entitled
to recover the cost of repairing its motor vehicle
notwithstanding the circumstance that the damage was caused when the hirer, its
co-insured, deliberately ran it into a tree.  The main point under
consideration was whether the loss or damage could be described
as
"accidental", with respect to the hire-purchase company, and there was little
discussion in point of principle about the possible
disqualification of an
insured by reason of the fraudulent or other criminal act of a co-insured.
However, there are other decisions
to the same effect.  There does not appear
to have been any exclusion clause that was relevant to the issue in Lombard's
case.'</i>
<P>

470   	Cox J then considered six decisions, namely <i>V.L.
Credits Pty Limited v Switzerland General Insurance Co Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1990/83.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] VicRp 83</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20VR%20938" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) VR

<P>

471   	In the light of these authorities, Cox J formed the view
that it was appropriate to hold:
<P>

<i>`First, that under a composite policy, such as the Law Society's
Professional Indemnity Policy, the fraudulent act of an insured person
will
not, without more, entitle the insurer to refuse to indemnify an innocent
co-insured and, secondly, that any exclusion clause
will not likely be read as
providing otherwise.  While in the end the terms of the policy will be
decisive, the mere use of the expression
"the insured" in an exclusion clause
will not necessarily be enough to disqualify the innocent co-insured.'</i>
<P>

472   	The Trustees submitted as follows:
<P>

<i>`The manner in which the Trustees seek to use Gilmore, is by reference to
the definition in Gilmore of "Assured" which relevantly
included the firm and
each partner, where the insurances were several and individual certificates of
insurance were issued to each
of the assured partners.</i>
<P>

<i>Gilmore concerned liability arising from the dishonesty of one partner.  The
relevant exclusion was in respect of the dishonesty of
the assured.  On the
Trustees' submission, the policy before the Court in Gilmore follows a format
and a statutory scheme similar
to the Queensland scheme so that the Trustees
submit that the principles of construction are particularly applicable to the
policies
now before the Court.</i>
<P>

<i>The Trustees point out that the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South
Australia held that, although if one just had regard to the
definition of
`Assured', one could see that one could read the definition of partner of the
assured into the exclusion clause, having
regard to the Certificates which were
issued, that construction was not the construction which ought be
adopted.</i>
<P>

<i>The Trustees now submit that in applying the contra proferentem rule,
reference to the `assured' in the exclusion clause means only
the individual
practitioner and the firm.</i>
<P>

<i>The Trustees draw attention to the holding in Gilmore that the firm itself
was not dishonest as distinct from the individual partner,
nor was the
individual assured, and hence to the decision that the exclusion clause did not
apply.</i>
<P>

<i>The burden of the Trustees' claim is that one is dealing with an exclusion
clause which here is said to exclude indemnity in respect
of liability brought
about by a dishonest act or omission.</i>
<P>

<i>The Trustees posit that one assumes a dishonest act giving rise to a
liability and an act which gives rise to a liability which is
not dishonest.
The Trustees' submission is that each of those acts is an effective cause of
the loss so that:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	all that is excluded from the indemnity is liability arising from the
dishonest act;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	one is left with an effective cause of the loss being a liability which
is not the subject of an exclusion.'</i>
<P>

473   	In my view, enough of the decision in <i>Gilmore</i> has
already been set out to make plain that at least in relation to the dishonesty
exclusion before me, the relevant clause was in
quite different terms to that
treated with in <i>Gilmore</i>.  The relevant insurance term in General
Exclusion paragraph 5(e)(v) expressly refers to `the Insurance . . . not
indemnifying the
Assured in respect of any liability brought out by the
dishonest or fraudulent act or omission of the assured <u>including any partner
or former partner of the assured'</u>.
<P>

474   	Particularly important as it seems to me, was the
reliance placed by Cox J upon the saving clause in sub-paragraph (iii)
of
paragraph (d) of the exclusion clause there under consideration.  The reasoning
was as follows:
<P>

<i>`<b>The exclusion clause in the Law Society's form of policy</b></i>
<P>

<i>I return to the certificate of insurance in question and on the assumption
(which the plaintiffs challenge) that the expression "the
Assured", in the case
of Mr Blue's certificate for instance, effectively refers to Mr Blue and also
to his partners in Fisher Jeffries.
 The question is whether this is what the
expression means in subpar (iii) of par (d) of the exclusion clause.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walsh QC, for the defendant, did not dispute that the insurance here was
several.  Nor, as I understood his submission, was he
concerned to challenge
the correctness of the decisions in North America and New Zealand and Australia
on which Mr Gray relied. 
Rather, he said, there is no room here for the modern
benign interpretation of a composite policy, preserving the rights of an
innocent
co-assured, in view of the terms of this particular exclusion
clause.</i>
<P>

<i>In my opinion, the defendant's submission, as a general proposition based
upon the pro forma policy, must be upheld.  When a certificate
of insurance
under the Law Society scheme insures a practitioner, his firm and his partners,
as shown in the schedule of the certificate
of insurance, that will identify
"the Assured" referred to in subpar (iii).  I do not accept Mr Gray's
submission that the reference
to "the Assured" in the exclusion clause is unapt
to bring in "the Practitioner, the Firm and each Partner thereof" because it
links
those constituents of the Assured conjunctively, not disjunctively
(unless, I suppose, all of the partners have been involved in
the relevant act
of dishonesty).  More to the point, I think, is the saving clause in subpar
(iii):</i>
<P>

<i>". . . save that this Exclusion shall not apply to liability arising out of
any claim brought about by the dishonest or fraudulent
act or omission of any
person employed in connection with the Practice (other than a director)
including any articled clerk, consultant
or associate."</i>
<P>

<i>If the plaintiff's argument is sound there is no need at all for a general
exception in the case of employees.  The implication to
be drawn from the
exception is that, without these words, persons employed in connection with the
practice would otherwise have been
included, and that of course is what would
happen if the effect of using the expression "the Assured" in subpar (iii) is
to bring
in all the relevant parts of the cl 1 definition."</i>
<P>

475   	Once one adverts to the saving clause, it became patently
clear simply as a matter of the proper construction of the express
words in
sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (d) of the exclusion clause, that the wording
of the Certificate, in particular sub-paragraph
(iii), indicated an intention
not to indemnify a partner against loss occasioned by the dishonest or
fraudulent acts or omissions
of a fellow partner, including a person who was a
partner at the time the loss was incurred.  Yet a further indicator to that
effect
was found by Cox J in the qualification in parenthesis with respect to a
director.  As Cox J said:
<P>

<i>`The director of an incorporated practice - the "Company Practitioner" as
the certificate describes it - will almost invariably be
an employee of the
practice as well.  It would be anomalous to deny the innocent partners of a
dishonest practitioner a right to
indemnity under the policy but to allow
recovery in the corresponding case of the innocent directors of a company
practitioner -
hence, I conclude, the director qualification to the general
exception with respect to employed persons.  In my opinion, the wording
of the
certificate, in particular subpar (iii), indicates an intention not to
indemnify a partner against loss occasioned by the
dishonest or fraudulent acts
or omissions of a fellow partner including a person who was a partner at the
time the loss was incurred.
 The indicators to that effect are strong enough, I
consider, to oust the liberal interpretation which might otherwise be given to
the policy in accordance with the modern trend of authority.  If there were any
real doubt or uncertainty about the proper interpretation
of the exemption
clause I would apply those cases I have cited to the plaintiff's benefit in
accordance with the contra proferentum
rule, but I think the meaning of the
certificate in the relevant respects is too clear for that.'</i>
<P>

476   	To my mind, the wording of the exclusion clause under
consideration in <i>Gilmore</i> is clearly distinguishable from the known
claims circumstances clauses presently requiring to be construed.
<P>

477   	The Trustees sought to gain particular assistance from an
application of the contra proferentem rule.  Their submissions
included the
following:
<P>

<i>`The Trustees submit that the decision in Gilmore applies by parity of
reasoning to the construction of the known claims or claims
circumstances
exclusion so as to require that the claims circumstances must be known to the
separately or severally insured.  The
known claims or claims circumstances
exclusion does not specify who must have the requisite knowledge.  The widest
construction of
the clause would require that the knowledge be had by anyone
falling within the definition of "the Assured".  That would have the
consequence that an insured partner who was not personally aware of the
relevant circumstances would not be covered because another
partner (or other
person falling within the definition "the Assured") did.  It would mean that Mr
Isles - who had retired as of 1
July 1990 - would not be entitled to indemnity
because someone else, who was insured under a relevant certificate or the
composite
policy (as the case may be), did.</i>
<P>

<i>In circumstances where the exclusion was clearly inserted by the Insurers
the exclusion should be construed contra proferentem so
as to entitle the
Insurers to decline indemnity only to an "Assured" who had knowledge of the
relevant circumstances.</i>
<P>

<i>The relevance of the decision in Gilmore is heightened for Years 2 and 3.
In each of those years, each partner was the recipient of,
and named in, an
individual Certificate of Insurance.  In the Trustees' Submission, the
consequence is that the facts are relevantly
indistinguishable from those
considered in Gilmore, so that the reasoning of Cox J must be applied.
Further, the failure to specify,
in the known claims or claims circumstances
clause, whose knowledge was to be regarded as relevant highlights the
significance of
the application by Cox J of the contra proferentem rule.'
</i>
<P>

478   	<i>Gilmore</i> being clearly distinguishable from the
present clauses under consideration, I do not accept the Trustees' submission
that it is possible
to extrapolate from the reasoning in <i>Gilmore</i> to the
findings for which the Trustees' contend.
<P>

<b>Holding on the construction issues</b>
<P>

479   	In my view, the question of construction must take into
account the constituent documents including the Proposal.  As made
plain in the
judgment of Sir Wilfred Greene M.R. in <i>General Accident Fire and Life
Assurance Corporation Ltd v Midland Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1940%5d%202%20KB%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1940] 2 KB 388</a> at 407-408,
words in a printed form must be given a construction which `fits in' with the
`essential nature' of the contract in question.
<P>

480   	This is not the first case involving difficult questions
of construction of a composite contract of insurance.  As pointed
out by
Gaudron in <i>Federation Insurance Ltd v Wasson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20163%20CLR%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 163 CLR 303</a> at
318-319:
<P>

<i>`The consideration that the policy encompasses separate obligations with
respect to the different insurance parties, or separate insurances
of the
separate interests of the insured parties does not mean that every right and
obligation provided in the policy should be construed
as a separate right or
obligation inhering in each of the insured parties'.</i>
<P>

481   	In the same case at 309-311, Mason CJ and Wilson, Dawson
and Toohey JJ made plain that a composite policy may call for a
distributive
application of its terms in certain contexts, but not in others.
<P>

482   	In <i>Advance (NSW) Insurance Agencies Pty Ltd v
Matthews</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20166%20CLR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 166 CLR 606</a> at 619 the majority consisting of Mason CJ and
Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said:
<P>

<i>`But we should point out that, even in the case of a composite contract,
some obligations are joint so that it is impossible to treat
the contract of
insurance as involving separate contracts:  see Deaves v CML Fire &amp; General
Insurance Co Ltd;  Federation Insurance
Ltd v Wasson;  United Shoe Machinery
Company of Canada v Brunet.'</i>
<P>

483   	As the Insurers submitted:
<P>

<i>`[d]ifferent considerations apply, depending upon the essential nature of
the insurance contract in question, whether one is considering
the right to
cancel the policy, the obligation to pay the premium or the insurer's right to
deny indemnity for fraudulent non-disclosure
or dishonesty.  In each case, the
issue is one of construction.'</i>
<P>

484   	In my view, the correct approach to the issue of
construction requires the Court in construing a commercial document to give
a
common sense and workable construction.  The construction issue requires to
take into account the wording of the Proposal.  When
one takes into account the
wording of the Proposal it becomes quite plain that the person making the
declaration and seeking the
cover on behalf of all the partners is required to
ascertain the extent and nature of the <u>separate</u> knowledge of each of the
partners as to relevant circumstances which may give rise to a claim.  The
question asks `Are you or any
of the partners aware after enquiry . . .'.  It
would make no sense of the Proposal if the Policy wording, including the
Special
Condition and General Condition 4(b) were to be construed in a way
which rendered it unnecessary for the Proposal to have sought
from the
proponent, information as to the state of knowledge of other partners of
circumstances which may give rise to a claim.
<P>

485   	Reverting for a moment to the facts, which show that the
parties approached their dealings in a manner consistent with this
construction, Mr Scanlan's evidence was that at the time of the renewal for
insurance, a memorandum would be circulated to the partners
in the firm, asking
them to respond as to whether or not they knew of any claims or claims
circumstances.
<P>

486   	To my mind, but acknowledging that the matter is not
beyond doubt, the better view is that the reference to a claim against
the
Assured should be given its wide meaning under Clause 1(a) of the Certificate
of Insurance as referring to the firm and each
partner - that is to say, as
referring to a claim against the partnership or against any member.  On this
approach, the reference
in Clause 4(b) to `the Assured [who] is or shall become
aware' of circumstances, is likewise a reference to the firm and each partner.
This approach caters for the need to import the definition of "the Assured" as
found in the "Interpretation" section [Clause 1(a)]
of the Certificate of
Insurance, into the construction of the words "of which the Assured is or shall
become aware" in General Condition
4(b).  It takes into account the wording in
the Proposal.  In short, the better view is that the word "Assured" in the
general condition
requires to be given the same meaning as that provided for in
the definitional provision.
<P>

487   	I note that in the light of the factual finding that by
22 June 1990 on the probabilities, all of the partners had become
aware of the
existence of circumstances which were capable of giving rise to a claim of the
nature of that later pursued by the Trustees
in the Cleary and Hoare
proceedings 5870 of 1994, this issue does not arise.  Whilst the matter is not
beyond doubt, on the better
view the proper construction of the known claims or
claims circumstances exclusion does not require that the claims circumstances
must be known to each and every one of the separately or severally insured.
<P>

488   	Finally, in my view, there was only one policy between
the firm on the one hand and the Insurers on the other being a composite
contract of insurance under which each partner was severally insured.
<P>

<b>One Claim/Two Claims</b>
<P>

489   	This issue arises out of proviso (a) to clause 2 - the so
called "Insuring Clauses".  That proviso requires that "all claims
arising from
the same act or omission, whether made against one or more Assured, shall be
regarded as one claim".  The proviso focuses
attention on the identification
firstly of the claim or claims and secondly of the circumstances - which must
be characterised as
"the same act or omission" to enliven the proviso - from
which those claims arise.
<P>

490   	The meaning of the word "<i>claim</i>" is one which has
caused difficulty in insurance law.  Cases on the subject were cited and
analysed by in <i>Schipp</i> at paragraph 946 and following.  The conclusion at
paragraph 958 was put as follows:
<P>

<i>"The meaning of the word "claim" is ultimately a question of the
construction of the policy.  Previous decisions as to the meaning
of the word
claims in the context of different policies provide only limited
assistance".</i>
<P>

491   	I accept as correct the Trustees' submission that in the
context of clause 2, the word "claims" in proviso (a) must have
the same
meaning as it has in the body of the insuring clause.  In that context, it is
clear that what is referred to is a "claim
or claims...against the Assured":
that is to say, an assertion of an entitlement to compensation or restitution
made by a third party
(in this case by or derivatively on behalf of a client)
against the Assured.
<P>

492   	The authorities suggest that the word "<i>claim</i>"
cannot be identified with "<i>cause of action</i>"; and that the formulation of
the claim by the party making it cannot be decisive of the rights and
liabilities of the party to the
insurance contract [See <i>West Wake Price
&amp; Co v Ching</i> [1957] 1WLR 45, 57; see also <i>Haydon v Lo &amp; Lo</i>
[1997] 1WLR 198, 206; see also <i>Thorman &amp; ors v New Hampshire Insurance
Co (UK) Ltd &amp; anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 1 Lloyd's Rep 7</a>, 16].
<P>

493   	The question of the number of claims is dependent upon
the underlying facts [<i>Haydon</i> at 204; <i>Thorman</i> at 16; <i>Schipp</i>
at paragraph 964.]  Further, or alternatively, the assessment of the number of
claims may be undertaken by the extent to which damages
in respect of each
alleged claim can be isolated [See <i>Thorman</i> at 11-12; see also
<i>Schipp</i> at paragraphs 966-967].
<P>

494   	Where there are separate and distinct causes of action
giving rise to the same loss or damage - as was the case, for example
in
<i>Schipp </i>[See the factual analysis commencing at paragraph 66, noting in
particular the alternative analysis at paragraphs 672 to 674] - it
is easy to
understand why there is only one claim.  Where however there are separate and
distinct causes of action leading to separate
and distinct heads of loss or
damage then it is not easy to understand why there is but one claim.  Further,
and a fortiori where
there are separate and distinct of causes of action
relating to separate and distinct transactions and leading to separate and
distinct
loss or damage, then there is, I accept, no basis in reason or
principle for finding that there is but one claim.
<P>

495   	The Trustees sought to illustrate the point by reference
to the facts in <i>Haydon</i>.  A fraudulent clerk, Yim, defrauded two estates:
the Tang Estate and the Tso Estate.  The fraud in respect of the Tang Estate
was
perpetrated over a period of two years by 43 separate acts of theft which
fell within four separate groups.  A claim was brought
by the Estate against
the solicitors for compensation or restitution in respect of the aggregate of
Yim's thefts.  It was not necessary
(in terms of pleading a complete cause of
action) for each and every one of the thefts to be pleaded and particularised;
but if less
than 43 had been pleaded and particularised, and judgment
recovered, the Estate would have been estopped, on the principle discussed
in
<i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589</a>, from
pursuing a claim for the balance - unless, perhaps, it could establish that it
was not unreasonable for it so to act [Cf. <i>Boles v Esanda Finance
Corporation Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 666].</a>
<P>

496   	I accept as correct the Trustees' submission that in the
present case, it would have been open to the Trustees to sue Cleary
&amp; Hoare
only in respect of the PMA1 transaction.  I accept that a judgment for or
against the Trustees would not have prevented
the Trustees thereafter from
suing Cleary &amp; Hoare in respect of the PMA2 transaction.  [This is clear
from the analysis of <i>Anshun</i> in the judgment of Samuels JA in
<i>Boles</i>; see in particular 18 NSWLR at 670, 672 - 673]. I accept that this
is because the causes of action in respect of the PMA1 and PMA2
transactions
are in law separate and distinct.
<P>

497   	The relevant facts are essentially undisputed.  The
evidence of the two retainers is found both in the statements of Messrs
Scanlan
and Cleary [Exhibits PX4(R) and PX6(R)], and in the correspondence contained in
Exhibit DX volumes 1 and 2.  I accept that
that evidence shows that there were
separate retainers of Cleary &amp; Hoare for the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions
[indeed, as the
Trustees pointed out, it could be said that there were separate
retainers for the various stages of the PMA 1 transaction.  I note
however that
the Trustees do not suggest that this means that the PMA 1 judgment debt should
be regarded as anything other than one
claim.]
<P>

498   	I accept as correct the Trustees' submission that the
pleading of the case against Cleary &amp; Hoare reflects the legal
reality [See
the further amended statement of claim exhibit PX1, volume 2, tab 42.  There is
nothing in the antecedent versions of
the pleading which puts the claim on any
different basis: see exhibit DX volume 3 (prior proceedings) tabs 1, 3.]
<P>

499   	The judgments which were recovered are separate
reflecting the separate claims.  I accept that the Trustees can hardly be
criticised for taking the judgments in a way which would not prevent or shut
out their prospects of success [See the evidence of
Mr Connor at transcript day
7, page 256, lines 40-52].  I accept as reliable Mr Connor's evidence that the
reason why separate judgment
debts were entered was that the view of the
Trustees' legal advisers was that there were two claims and that `we [which I
take to
be a reference to the Trustees acting on legal advice] wanted to ensure
a [sic] settlement did not prevent . . . or shut out that
issue' [transcript
256].
<P>

500   	I accept that there is no legal or factual connection
between PMA 1 and PMA 2, in the sense that the latter in no way, legally
or
factually, depends upon, or assumes the existence of, the former.  The case is
plainly distinct from that presented in <i>Schipp</i> where the integral
relationship between the various steps of the scheme, and the overarching
nature of the deception practised on
Mrs Schipp, was clearly explained in the
judgment [See in particular paragraphs 666-671 and the alternative analysis in
paragraphs
672-674.]  In the present case, it is, I accept, entirely
conceivable that the Trustees could have succeeded on one claim but not,
for
some reason or other, on the other: if there were but one claim then this could
not be the case.
<P>

501   	The only basis on which it can be suggested that there
might be one claim is that the PMA 1 and PMA 2 transactions formed
part of one
overall scheme to defraud BPTC, and that Cleary &amp; Hoare knew of and were an
integral part of that scheme.  Not even
the Insurers put a case of such
startling width: either in opening or in cross-examination of Messrs Scanlan
and Cleary.  The most
that can be put is that Cleary &amp; Hoare were guilty of
consecutive but relevantly unrelated breaches of fiduciary duty, in consecutive
but relevantly unrelated transactions, because in each case they preferred the
interests of one client by not disclosing material
information to the other
client.  I accept that the factual similarity of the breaches cannot convert
two transactions into one,
two causes of action into one, or two separate
claims of loss into one.
<P>

502   	Suppose that in PMA 1 the loans had been funded by Trusts
A, B and C; and that in PMA 2 the loans had been funded by Trusts
X, Y and Z
(each being a separate and distinct trust but having BPTC as Trustee).   The
Trustees ask: `Could it be said that, in
those circumstances, there was but one
claim?'  The answer, I accept, must be "no".  How then can the absence of that
factual element
convert two claims into one?  The answer, I accept, is that it
can not.
<P>

503   	In my view, there having been separate and distinct
causes of action leading to separate and distinct heads of loss or damage,
the
situation gave rise to two claims.
<P>

<b>The Breach of Contract Claim : Clause 4(b) - For Years 2 and 3</b>
<P>

504   	The Insurers pleaded this cause of action against the
possibility that the exclusion for known claims circumstances was said
by the
Trustees to have had no contractual force.  No submissions were advanced by the
Trustees to this effect.  In the result and
as foreshadowed by Mr Pembroke at
transcript of 13 August 1999 page 190, it is unnecessary to deal with this
issue which was ultimately
not litigated.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act 1984</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.54:</a> Election</b>
<P>

505   	The Trustees' claims having failed by reason of the
dishonesty exclusion, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the Trustees'
claimed
reliance upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 54</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a>.
<P>

<b>The $500,000 cross-claim</b>
<P>

506   	By this cross-claim, the 1990/1991 primary insurers seek
to recover the amount of $500,000 paid on account of indemnity rights
of Cleary
&amp; Hoare in relation to the first Settlement Agreement entered into on 29
October 1997.
<P>

507   	The Insurers claim that the payment was made by the
1990/1991 primary insurers on account of any indemnity rights which Cleary
&amp; Hoare <u>may</u> have.  The submission is that it was paid in order to
allow Cleary &amp; Hoare to settle their differences with the Trustees in a
manner favorable to them.  The Insurers' submission is that at the time the
payment was made, the 1990/91 primary insurers had not
denied indemnity to
Cleary and Hoare and were not aware of all the circumstances upon which they
now rely to support their subsequent
denial of indemnity and to establish that
Cleary and Hoare acted dishonestly.
<P>

508   	It is clear from the evidence of Mr O'Connor that the
payment was made by Cleary and Hoare's then solicitors, Maddock Lonie
&amp;
Chisholm.  Although apparently the primary layer insurers were the source of
those funds, and in this respect I accept the
evidence of Mr Connor at
transcript pages 256-257, they were paid to Cleary &amp; Hoare or more
accurately at, I infer, the direction
of Cleary &amp; Hoare to Maddock Lonie
&amp; Chisholm.  I accept the Trustees' submission that it was in fact Cleary
&amp; Hoare
who, through their solicitors, made the payment to the Trustees.
<P>

509   	By letter dated 28 October 1997 Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth
wrote to Baker &amp; McKenzie advising inter alia:
<P>

<i>`Our clients have instructed us to inform you that they do consent to the
Solicitors and Scanlan entering into the Settlement Agreement
and Deed of
Assignment by way of Security.  This consent is given on the basis that it is
the understanding of our clients, the Solicitors
and Scanlan that the payment
of $500,000 made pursuant to clause 5 of the Settlement Deed is a</i><cite>
commercial payment</cite><i> only and does not constitute and is not capable of
constituting an admission that the Solicitors and Scanlan are entitled to
indemnity
pursuant to or that there are two claims under either the 1989/90 or
1990/91 Primary and Excess Policies of insurance.'</i>
<P>

510   	The Trustees submit that at the time the Insurers made
the payment to Maddock Lonie &amp; Chisholm they determined to make
a
`commercial payment' and that in the context of the circumstances of which the
Insurers were then aware, it is presently impossible
for the Insurers to
maintain that the Trustees have been unjustly enriched at the expense of the
Insurers.
<P>

511   	The matter is said to turn on whether or not at the time
the payment was made the 1990/91 primary insurers who had not denied
indemnity
to Cleary &amp; Hoare, were or were not aware of all the circumstances upon
which they now rely to support their subsequent
denial of indemnity and to
establish that Cleary &amp; Hoare acted dishonestly.
<P>

512   	Ultimately it seems to me that the Trustees' submissions
are correct.  It is true that the 1990/91 excess insurers had denied
indemnity
to Cleary &amp; Hoare at the time the payment was made and that one might focus
on the bases which it may be argued, underpinned
that denial.  However, the
Insurers made a commercial decision in a complex factual position and at a time
when the precise facts
were in a state of some uncertainty.  It was known that
the funds would be paid to the Trustees.
<P>

513   	It follows it seems to me, that the Trustees cannot be
said to have been unjustly enriched by receipt of the sum of $500,000
and that
it cannot be said to be unconscionable for them to retain that sum.
<P>

514   	The $500,000 amount was paid in order to allow Cleary
&amp; Hoare to settle their differences with the Trustees in a manner
favorable
to them.  It does not seem to me that there is an element of injustice here
involved which is sufficient to establish a
restitutionary claim.
<P>

<b>The Good Faith Proceedings</b>
<P>

515   	As earlier indicated in the Judgment, the good faith
proceedings were only relevant should the Court find, contrary to the
position
of the insurers, that Cleary &amp; Hoare were entitled to indemnity under their
1991/92 policies.  In this regard I note
that the first bracket of evidence
given by Mr Hoare, the evidence given by Mr Connor and the evidence given by Mr
Murphy, save for
two matters relating to Mr Connor, went essentially to the
issues raised in the good faith proceedings.  The matters relating to
Mr Connor
involved first, a few questions put to him on the `one claim/two claims' issue
[ - See the reference to this evidence under
that heading in the Judgment] and
secondly his acceptance in relation to the $500,000 cross-claim, that the
moneys were paid at source
by the primary insurers [see the reference to this
evidence under that heading in the Judgment].
<P>

516   	As no finding has been made that Cleary &amp; Hoare were
entitled to indemnity under their 1991/92 policies, it seems to
me unnecessary
to proceed to determine the good faith proceedings.  For the same reason, it
seems to me, strictly unnecessary to
set out the initial evidence of Mr Hoare,
the evidence of Mr Murphy and that of Mr Connor going to these matters.  I note
that having
raised this question with the parties, I did not understand any
party to submit that save for the reference to part of Mr Connor's
evidence
already set out, any answers given by those witnesses may be suggested as going
to issues outside the good faith proceedings.
<P>

517   	I do propose, however, to grant leave to the parties,
having the benefit of all of the above reasons, to address submissions
as to
the need or utility in the Court notwithstanding the findings, to proceed to
determine the good faith proceedings.
<P>

<b>Jones v Dunkel - The position of Mr Lacey</b>
<P>

518   	The Trustees submitted that on the evidence, the Court
should find that BPTC was well aware that both Weltsbarrd and Yossarian
were
companies associated with EMM.  On the evidence, I make no such findings.  To
the contrary, my finding on the evidence is that
BPTC was unaware that
Weltsbarrd and Yossarian were companies associated with EMM.
<P>

519   	Exhibit DX1 includes an exchange of correspondence
between Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth, the solicitors for the Insurers and Baker
&amp; McKenzie, the solicitors for the Trustees.  By letter dated 5 August
1999, Ebsworths wrote to Baker &amp; McKenzie stating,
inter alia:
<P>

<i>`</i><cite>As to Brian Lacey</cite>
<P>

<i>We understand that Mr Pembroke SC and Mr McDougall QC have discussed the
relevance of Mr Lacey's evidence.  We confirm that the relevance
of Mr Lacey's
evidence is only to the fact that the alleged dishonest conduct of the insured
"brought about" the liability constituted
by the PMA 1 and PMA 2 Judgment
Debts.  If that is not a fact in issue in the proceedings, please let us know.
If it is, and you
wish to cross-examine Mr Lacey, please let us know and ensure
that any documents on which you will rely in your cross-examination,
are
included in the bundle or otherwise advised to us.  It is not satisfactory, nor
in accordance with the Court's orders, for you
to hold back documents on which
you are relying in any way, especially any document of which we are
unaware'.</i>
<P>

520   	The responsive letter of the same date from Baker &amp;
McKenzie to Ebsworths stated, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`Brian Lacey.  We note you comment as to the relevance of Mr Lacey's
evidence.  In response we advise that our clients contend that
the losses
reflected in the PMA 1 Judgment Debt were caused by the conduct of the
solicitors as pleaded expressly or by incorporation
in paragraph 46 of the
further amended statement of claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria proceedings
no 4870 of 1994.  It is also
contended that the losses reflected in the PMA 2
Judgment Debt were caused by the conduct of the solicitors pleaded expressly or
by incorporation in paragraph 56 of the further amended statement of claim in
the Supreme Court of Victoria proceedings no 5870 of
1994.</i>
<P>

<cite>Our clients accept that if in either or both cases such conduct of the
solicitors is found to have been dishonest</cite><i> (which dishonesty is not
admitted by the trustees) </i><cite>that the necessary causal link will have
been made out</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Please let us know whether in light of the above you intend to proceed with
Mr Lacey's evidence.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

521   	By letter dated 10 August 1999 Ebsworths wrote to Baker
&amp; McKenzie stating, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`In relation to Mr Lacey, in light of the concession made in your letter
dated 5 August 1999, we advise that we do not propose to
read his
statement.'</i>
<P>

522   	By letter dated 10 August 1999, Baker &amp; McKenzie
wrote to Ebsworths advising, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`We advise that we do require Mr Lacey for cross-examination.  The ambit of
the cross-examination will be limited and we do not expect
it to involve any
documents which are not already in the plaintiffs' or defendants' bundles of
documents.'</i>
<P>

523   	In opening the case, Mr McDougall at transcript page 5,
stated `I don't propose to cross-examine Mr Pembroke's witnesses.
 In relation
to one of them, we've reached an agreement which renders it unnecessary to call
him.'  I understand Mr McDougall to
have there been referring to Mr Lacey's
statement.
<P>

524   	At transcript page 18 on 11 August 1999 in opening, Mr
McDougall said inter alia:
<P>

<i>`We said in the proceedings in Victoria that, by reason of their retainer by
the trustee, the solicitors came under a fiduciary obligation
to disclose to
the trustee information in their possession relating to the equity sharing
agreement.  By reason of their retainer
in relation to that agreement they were
under a fiduciary obligation to the other client not to do so.  They placed
themselves in
a position of conflict of interest and duty, or more accurately,
of duty and duty and as a result the trustee suffered loss which
we sued to
recover.</i>
<P>

<i>Now that isn't in dispute . . .'</i>
<P>

525   	In final submissions at transcript page 208 on 30 August
1999, I enquired of Mr McDougall in relation to the recent decision
of the
Court of Appeal in <i>McCann</i>.  The following appears in the transcript:
<P>

<i>`His Honour:	Now, in so far as the decision deals with proximate cause and
matters not going specifically to definitions of dishonesty
in the ambit of
East End or Schipp v Cameron, or Justice Hunter's decision, what are the
parameters, if any, in relation to this
case which raise proximate cause which
may be affected by the Court of Appeal Judgment, or are there none really in
the way the case
has been run?</i>
<P>

<i>McDougall:	There is really no question of proximate cause in the sense that
there is a concession by us that if dishonesty of the
relevant kind is found,
then the loss that resulted, or the loss that BPT suffered, was the result of
that dishonesty.'</i>
<P>

526   	Paragraphs 40.1, 40.2 and 40.3 of the Trustees' final
submissions sought to raise questions of fact going to BPTC's alleged
knowledge
that both Weltsbarrd and Yossarian were companies associated with EMM.
<P>

527   	Paragraph 41 of the Trustees' final submissions are then
in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`There has been no evidence to rebut the matters of fact referred to in
paragraphs 39 and 40, although Mr Lacey at least was, apparently,
available as
a witness.'</i>
<P>

528   	To my mind, the concession made by the Trustees'
solicitors in the correspondence, part of Exhibit DX1 to which I have referred
and in the sections of the transcript to which I have referred, make plain that
the Trustees have not litigated or called a case
to the effect that BPTC was
aware that Weltsbarrd and Yossarian were companies associated with EMM.  Had
that matter been appropriate
to have been litigated, it would have been
necessary for Mr Lacey's statement to have been read by the Insurers and for Mr
Lacey
to have been cross-examined on that statement.  I accept that the
Insurers did not read the statement by reason of the concession.
 Clearly
implicit in the concession was that BPTC was not aware that Weltsbarrd and
Yossarian were associated with EMM.  The statement
became part of Exhibit DX1
not for the purpose of proving the content of the statement but for the purpose
of proving that the statement
was available to have been read by the Insurers
but for the concessions.
<P>

529   	I draw no inference from the Insurers' failure to read
and rely upon the statement of Mr Lacey.
<P>

<b>Short Minutes of Order</b>
<P>

530   	The proceedings will be stood over for a few days to
permit the parties an opportunity to prepare short Minutes of Order,
to address
submissions on any matters which it may be suggested remain to be dealt with
and for the purposes of argument in relation
to costs.
<P>

<b>Reserved Judgment</b>
<P>

531   	I am conscious of the fact that the tender of the
documents comprising DX9 followed rulings after a contest on legal professional
privilege.  A reserved judgment on that matter is being prepared and will be
handed down shortly.
<P>
