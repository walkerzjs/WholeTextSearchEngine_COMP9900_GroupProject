<b>FRIDAY 1 OCTOBER 1999</b>
<P>

<b>105304/97  - BRIAN JOSEPH WITHERS &amp; ANOR v WIILIAM JOHN BRAY &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>Estate of AGNES IRENE BRAY</b> 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	This is an application by the plaintiffs Brian Joseph
Withers and Patrick Bernard Withers for Letters of Administration of
the estate
of the late Agnes Irene Bray (the deceased) who died intestate on 6 April 1994.

<P>

2   	The plaintiffs are the sons of the late William Charles
Withers (Mr Withers) who died on 18 April 1995 and the defendants are
the
siblings of the deceased.  There is a cross claim by one of the sisters of the
deceased, Olwyn Joy King, for Letters of Administration
to be granted to
her.
<P>

3   	The main issue to be determined in these proceedings is
whether at the time of her death the deceased and Mr Withers were living
in a
de facto relationship within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s32g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s32G(1)</a> of the <b>Wills, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate
and Administration Act 1898</a> (NSW) </b>(the Act).  
<P>

4   	There is no issue between the parties that if the existence
of a de facto relationship is established the estate of Mr Withers
becomes
entitled absolutely to the entirety of the estate by virtue of s61B and s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s32g.html" class="autolink_findacts">32G</a> of
the Act.  In such circumstances it would be appropriate to grant Letters of
Administration to the plaintiffs. 
<P>

<b>Indicia of a de facto relationship</b>
<P>

5   	The determination of the existence of a de facto
relationship involves the Court making a value judgment having regard to a
variety of factors relating to the relationship.  Those factors include matters
relating to property and finances;  the duration,
extent and nature of the
relationship including whether a sexual relationship existed;  children and
their care and the reputation
of the relationship ( <b>Roy v Sturgeon</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20NSWLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 NSWLR 454</a>  at 458-459).
<P>

6   	Counsel for the defendants and cross claimant, Mr Hickey,
relied upon Einstein J's judgment in <b>Bar-Mordecai v Rotman &amp; Anor</b>
(unreported 16 - 18 June 1998) in support of the submission that if I was
satisfied there was no sexual relationship between the
deceased and Mr Withers
I would not be satisfied that there was a de facto relationship.  He relied in
particular upon par 507 of
that judgment in which His Honour said:
<P>

<i>While the nature and extent of a sexual relationship is only one of the
factors identified by Powell J in D v McA (unreported, Supreme
Court of NSW, 27
June 1986) and Roy v Sturgeon  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20NSWLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 NSWLR 454</a> at 458 - 459, as indicative
of a de facto relationship, it is, in my view, an important consideration in
these proceedings.  The
sexual element of the relationship and the intimacy it
entails is unique to marital or de facto relationships.  It is a singular
and
easily identifiable distinguishing feature."</i>  
<P>

7   	All parties have adopted the approach that the sexual
element of a relationship is an important factor in determining whether
the
deceased and Mr Withers were in a defacto relationship.  
<P>

8   	It has not been suggested by the plaintiffs that if I were
to find that there was no sexual relationship I could still find
the existence
of a de facto relationship.  The plaintiffs' approach in this regard may well
have been guided by what they believed
was a strong case in favour of a finding
of the existence of a sexual relationship.
<P>

9   	Although opinions may differ on Einstein J's view that the
sexual element of a relationship and the consequential intimacy
is "unique" to
marriage or de facto relationships it is not a view which I must dissect in
deciding this case.  However a realistic
approach has to be adopted to the
assessment of this matter (<b>Evans  v Marmont </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a> at
75G).
<P>

10   	The parties in this case accept that there was a 40 year
relationship between the deceased and Mr Withers and that such relationship
endured until the death of the deceased.  It is also accepted that the deceased
and Mr Withers lived in the same house for the last
18 years of their
relationship.  
<P>

11   	Although there were submissions made in relation to the
alleged separateness of their finances the main focus of the proceedings
was
upon whether or not there was a sexual relationship.  The defendants and in
particular the cross claimant, Mrs King, contended
that there was no sexual
relationship between the deceased and Mr Withers and thus no de facto
relationship.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

12   	The deceased was born on 8 April 1927 and was the second
eldest of nine children.  She grew up on the family farm at Tyalgum,
in
northern New South Wales, where she lived until 1951. 
<P>

13   	In approximately 1951 the deceased moved to Murwillumbah
to live and worked at Woolworths to supplement her income as a dressmaker.
 It
was whilst working at Woolworths in the early 1950s that the deceased, who was
then about 24 years of age, met Mr Withers who
was then aged about 42 years. Mr
Withers was driving a taxi which operated from the taxi rank directly outside
Woolworths.  He had
been married but was separated from his wife.  He too was
living in Murwillumbah.
<P>

14   	The deceased was a keen gambler and liked to attend the
races.  When she needed transport to attend the races Mr Withers would
drive
her to and from the racetrack in his taxi.
<P>

15   	During the 1960s the deceased and Mr Withers jointly
purchased a hotel in Coraki known as the Middle Hotel.  They each contributed
to the purchase price and shared the responsibilities of operating the hotel
with the deceased as the licensee.
<P>

16   	The deceased and Mr Withers operated the hotel for about
nine months and then sold it so that the deceased could return to
Murwillumbah
to care for her father who was very ill.  After the sale they each deducted
from the proceeds of sale what they had
invested into the hotel and the balance
was divided equally between them.
<P>

17   	The deceased, whose mother had died in 1970,  moved back
into the family home at Tyalgum to care for her father. Her father's
illness
led to his death in 1972.  During the period that the deceased was looking
after her father Mr Withers lived with his son
Brian and daughter in law
Margaret at their home not far from Murwillumbah.  
<P>

18   	After her father's death the deceased and Mr Withers
purchased another hotel, known as the Railway Hotel, in Queensland near
Toowoomba.  They contributed equally to the purchase of  the hotel and once
again operated it together with the deceased as licensee.
 Upon its sale the
balance of the proceeds of sale after payment of any debts remained in a bank
account in both the deceased's and
Mr Withers' names.
<P>

19   	In about 1975 Mr Withers was diagnosed with some form of
cardiac problem and was apparently admitted to Tweed Heads Hospital
for
treatment of the problem although neither the detail of the problem nor the
treatment are in evidence.
<P>

20   	Also in about 1975 the deceased and Mr Withers decided to
jointly purchase some land at Condong, near Murwillumbah.  The money
in the
joint bank account was used to pay for the purchase of the land and  the
construction of a house on the land.  It is apparent
that there was enough
money in the account to also purchase furniture and electrical items for the
house.
<P>

21   	The property at Condong was registered in the names of the
deceased and Mr Withers as tenants in common.  The house consisted
of two
bedrooms, a lounge room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom and what was described
as "other normal facilities".  There was a
"downstairs area which was used as a
garage and workshop" and a very large yard area.
<P>

22   	The deceased and Mr Withers lived in this house together
from the time of its construction in 1976 until April 1994.  In those
18 years
it appears that they were only apart for a number of days in some of those
years when the deceased travelled to Sydney to
visit relatives.
<P>

23   	Mr Withers swore a number of affidavits.  In addition to
the description given by Mr Withers of his intimate sexual relationship
with
the deceased, with which I shall deal later, he also described the way in which
he and the deceased shared the household duties.
 That evidence was that the
deceased did the cooking, washing, ironing and cleaning of the house and that
Mr Withers would carry
out the "chores normally carried out by the male of the
house".  Those chores included caring for the lawns and gardens including
a
vegetable patch and general maintenance including painting of the house.
<P>

24   	Mr Withers had a special garden in which he grew flowers
to sell on Mother's Day. The deceased helped Mr Withers tend that
garden and
assisted him in the sale of the flowers on Mother's Day.
<P>

25   	The deceased operated her dress making business from home.
It appears that it was a good business and kept the deceased quite
busy.
Although there was no telephone connected to the home the next door neighbour,
Mrs Julie Annette Dawson, was willing to allow
her telephone number to be given
to the deceased's clients to leave messages for the deceased.  The messages
were then passed on
to the deceased by Mrs Dawson. 
<P>

26   	The deceased's interest in gambling endured during her
years at the Condong property and she would attend the local races
from time to
time.  Mr Withers informed his son, Brian, that he and the deceased were in a
syndicate that owned a racehorse and on
occasions the deceased would inform
Brian Withers that "our horse is running today".  It is clear that the deceased
enjoyed betting
on the races and she also regularly attended the raffle at the
local Bowling club.
<P>

27   	The deceased and Mr Withers were keen bowlers.  They
bowled together in mixed pairs against the deceased's sister, the cross
claimant Mrs King, and her husband at the Gold Coast, Condong and Murwillumbah.
They also played bowls in non-mixed competitions.
<P>

28   	The deceased was diagnosed with carcinoma in 1987 and
after some initial treatment went into remission until late 1993 when
the
disease took hold again.  The deceased underwent chemotherapy treatment but by
late March 1994 was so ill that she was admitted
to Murwillumbah Hospital and
demised on 6 April 1994.
<P>

29   	Quite a deal of evidence has been given by the defendants
in respect of the deceased's last months of life the purpose of
which was to
prove that Mr Withers had contributed less than the defendants to the
deceased's care during this period.  There is
no doubt that both Mr Withers and
those defendants who gave evidence contributed each in their own caring way to
the comfort of the
deceased as her health declined.
<P>

30   	Each looked to the deceased with love and respect.  It is
apparent from the evidence that the deceased had adopted somewhat
of a parental
role after the death of her parents and that from time to time her siblings
looked to her for strength.  In some instances
they were also financially
assisted by her.  Mrs King regarded her as her best friend and "mother".
<P>

31   	Some of the defendants' evidence was tendered to suggest
that Mr Withers was not concerned by the death of the deceased. 
The evidence
relied upon in this regard was that the deceased did not want to arrange the
funeral and a suggestion that he did not
know when the funeral was to occur.
<P>

32   	However I am satisfied that Mr Withers was indeed
distressed by the death of the woman with whom he had shared a relationship
for
at least 40 years and lived with for 18 years.  The evidence relied upon by the
defendants themselves suggests just that.  
<P>

33   	Mrs Mavis King, another sister of the deceased, gave
evidence that on the day of her sister's death Mr Withers said  "What's
going
to happen to me?  What am I going to do now?".  In my view such a statement by
Mr Withers indicates the deep loss he was feeling
and perhaps an attempt to
communicate that he did not know how he was going to cope without the deceased.
My view in this regard
is supported by the evidence of Mr Withers' son, Brian,
that his father said "I have lost her" and the observations made by Mrs Dawson
of Mr Withers' obvious and deep distress at the time.
<P>

34   	After the deceased's funeral there was a "wake" at the
Murwillumbah Bowling Club.  Mr Withers' daughter in law, Margaret 
Withers,
gave evidence that she had a conversation with the deceased's niece Mary Anne
McAndrew.  Mrs Withers said that Mrs McAndrew
said to her "I'm warning you
there is going to be trouble.  They are going to say that there is no de facto
relationship and we all
know there was."  This conversation has some
significance in relation to the issue that I have to decide in this case and I
will
return to it in due course.  
<P>

35   	Mr Withers health declined after the death of the
deceased.  His medical practitioner Dr John Lipscom gave evidence by way
of
affidavit that from June 1990 until 10 August 1993 when Mr Withers had a mild
cardiovascular accident (stroke) his mind was "exceptionally
sharp".  After the
minor stroke Mr Withers suffered some "minor short-term memory problems".
<P>

36   	On 12 August 1994 Mr Withers suffered a stroke extension
which further effected his short-term memory and caused "a little
confusion".
Dr Lipscom said that Mr Withers suffered from a moderate vascular dementia in
the very late stage of his life but did
not experience any serious dementia.
He died on 18 April 1995.
<P>

<b>Mr Withers' Affidavits</b>
<P>

37   	Mr Withers swore affidavits on 2 August 1994, 25 August
1994 and 28 March 1995.  The first affidavit was sworn prior to the
stroke
extension suffered on 12 August 1994 and the latter two were sworn after such
incident and the last affidavit was sworn during
a period which may have
involved what Dr Lipscom referred to as a period of moderate vascular
dementia.
<P>

38   	Mr Hickey submitted that the weight to be given to the
evidence in these affidavits is lessened by reason of the fact that
it was not
able to be the subject of cross examination.  Additionally it was submitted I
should assess the evidence on the basis
that Mr Withers' memory may well have
been adversely affected by his failing health.
<P>

39   	In the affidavit sworn on 28 March 1995 Mr Withers
described the bedrooms in the Condong property.  He said that one of the
bedrooms had a double bed in it and the other bedroom had two single beds.  He
said that he and the deceased shared the other bedroom
with the two single beds
in it.  Mr Withers said that the deceased moved into the room with the double
bed shortly before her death
for her comfort.  
<P>

40   	Mr Withers made the following statements in his affidavit
relevant to the nature of his relationship with the deceased:
<P>

<i>"I commenced having a relationship with her at around that time (the 1950s)
and I commenced going out socially with her from that
date on.</i>
<P>

			<i>		(Par 3; 28.3.95)</i>
<P>

<i>While we were living in the hotel at Coraki, we each had our own room but
had a sexual relationship at that time.</i>
<P>

						<i>(Par 4; 28.3.95)</i>
<P>

<i>(At Condong) We both shared the other bedroom with the two (2) single beds
in it.  We chose to sleep in the single beds because of
the heat and because of
my medical condition, so that we could both get a good night's sleep.</i>
<P>

						<i>(Par 8; 28.3.95)</i>
<P>

<i>Over that period (from 1975 onwards) and prior to our moving into the
Condong premises, the deceased and I had a normal sexual relationship
and would
have sexual intercourse on a regular basis.</i>
<P>

						<i>(Par 9; 28.3.95)</i>
<P>

41   	In describing the financial arrangements Mr Withers stated
that after the joint bank account funds were exhausted he and the
deceased
conducted separate bank accounts and maintained separate investments.  Mr
Withers cited the need to cater for his children
and grandchildren as a reason
for these separate arrangements.
<P>

42   	He also referred to the fact that he and the deceased were
receiving the pension.  His evidence in this regard was :
<P>

<i>"To enable this to occur we were both required to have separate bank
accounts and our Pension cheques were paid directly into that
account" </i>
<P>

43   	On the last day of the hearing and after the evidence had
been completed an application was made by the defendants/cross claimant
for an
adjournment to pursue enquires with the Department of Social Security as to
whether in claiming an entitlement  to the pension
the deceased and/or Mr
Withers had stated they were not in a de facto relationship.  I refused the
adjournment which is the subject
of a separate judgment.
<P>

44   	Mr Withers also deposed to the fact that from time to time
he and the deceased did various jobs.  He said that the income
that the
deceased received from her dressmaking business went into her account so that
it would not affect his pension.
<P>

<b>Cross Claim</b>
<P>

45   	Mrs King  swore two affidavits one on 4 January 1999 and
one on 12 January 1999.  Her sisters Mrs Mavis King and Mrs Eva Cook
swore
affidavits on 4 January 1999 and 12 January 1999 respectively.  Mrs King's
brother Mr William Bray swore an affidavit on 4
January 1999 and the deceased's
niece Mrs Mary McAndrew swore her affidavit on 24 December 1998.
<P>

46   	There was no doubt that at the time that these affidavits
were sworn each of the deponents was aware that the plaintiffs were
claiming
that the deceased and Mr Withers had been in a de facto relationship.  Each of
the affidavits deals with observations made
of the deceased and Mr Withers in
support of a contention that there was no such relationship.
<P>

<u>William John Bray</u>
<P>

47   	Mr Bray is the elder brother of the deceased and visited
her regularly.  He said he never discussed the deceased's personal
life and did
not know whether the deceased and Mr Withers ever slept in the same room.  
<P>

48   	Mr Bray told me that his sister, the deceased, was a "very
private person" and never talked about any sexual matters.   His
observations
of his deceased sister sleeping in a separate room from Mr Withers was when
they visited the farm at Tyalgum prior to
1970.
<P>

<u>Mavis Jean King</u>
<P>

49   	Mrs Mavis King is another sister of the deceased and
claimed that she lived with the deceased from November 1993 until her
death on
6 April 1994.  This statement in her affidavit seems to be erroneous because on
Mrs King's oral evidence she did not suggest
that she was living with the
deceased for more than about three weeks prior to her death.  Indeed all the
evidence points to the
conclusion that Mrs King was only there for a couple of
weeks prior to the deceased's death.
<P>

50   	Mrs King said that the deceased was reserved,
well-organised and not talkative about her affairs.
<P>

51   	She made observations of the deceased and Mr Withers when
she worked in the Coraki Hotel as the housemaid.  That was a period
of
approximately 21 months during the 1960's.  She observed that the deceased and
Mr Withers kept separate bedrooms.  Mrs King observed
Mr Withers caring for the
deceased prior to her death and it is obvious from those observations that Mr
Withers and the deceased
were very close.  She accepted that the decline in her
sister's health was a very "big strain" on Mr Withers.      
<P>

52   	Mrs King confirmed in her oral evidence that, the deceased
was a "very, very private person" and liked to keep things to herself
about her
private life.  In cross examination Mrs King agreed with Mr Young that the
deceased would not talk about sexual matters
because she was not the sort of
person to talk about such matters.  
<P>

53   	In cross examination Mrs King accepted that the deceased
and Mr Withers slept in the same room at Condong;  that they divided
up the
housework;  that Mr Withers would sometimes hang out all the washing;  that
they each did some cooking and that Mr Withers
always did the lawns.  She
agreed with Mr Young that the way the deceased and Mr Withers lived was "pretty
similar to the way that
a lot of married couples live".
<P>

<u>Olwyn Joy King</u>
<P>

54   	Mrs King was twelve years younger than the deceased and
regarded her as her best friend.  She lived with the deceased for
two years
prior to getting married and when Mrs King was living in Tenterfield with her
husband and children the deceased would telephone
her every Saturday at 6
pm.
<P>

55   	In the affidavits that Mrs King swore she set out her
observations in support of the contention that there was no sexual relationship
between the deceased and Mr Withers.  Her detailed observations included the
fact that the deceased and Mr Withers had separate bedrooms
at the Coraki Hotel
and at the Railway Hotel.  
<P>

56   	Mrs King went into particular detail in relation to the
Condong property.  She said that the deceased had a "separate bedroom"
and
further that her room "had a beautiful bed cover, a double bed and a lovely
dressing table set with crystal".  In contrast Mrs
King observed that Mr
Withers' "separate room" was "sparsely furnished and very masculine".  She said
it contained "two single beds,
a little narrow wardrobe and a chest of
drawers".
<P>

57   	Additional to these observations Mrs King deposed to the
fact that when she visited her sister at the Condong property Mr
Withers would
sleep on the couch.  She also claimed that she never saw her sister show "real
affection" towards Mr Withers and never
saw them kissing.  However she did say
that her sister was "shy of affection".  
<P>

58   	Somewhat inconsistently with the contents of her
affidavit, Mrs King admitted in oral evidence that she was aware that the
deceased and Mr Withers had slept in the same room but in single beds.  The
timing of Mrs King's evidence was the subject of cross
examination because it
occurred after her sister Mrs Mavis King had given evidence that the deceased
and Mr Withers slept in the
same room.  
<P>

59   	When Mr Young asked Mrs King why it was that she had not
included such an observation in her affidavit she said that it was
after Mr
Withers had his mild stroke that the deceased had decided for Mr Withers
"safety" and she would move into that bedroom because
"if he took a turn in the
night" she would hear him.  She resisted any suggestion that the deceased and
Mr Withers slept in the same
room for a period longer than three or four years.

<P>

60   	When Mr Young asked Mrs King about her observations of the
deceased and Mr Withers and whether they appeared to be fond of
one another Mrs
King resisted describing the relationship as one of fondness.  She described it
as one in which her sister and Mr
Withers respected one another and that they
were "good friends".  She said she couldn't assess how fond they were of each
other.
 
<P>

61   	Mr Young with some persistence pressed Mrs King for an
explanation as to why it was that no mention had been made of the deceased
and
Mr Withers sleeping in the same room in her affidavit.  Mrs King said:  " I
admit that I should have put this in that from illness
they slept in the one
room, but I didn't".  She was then asked whether she could explain why she
didn't put that material in her
affidavit and she said she could not explain
it.  She was then asked:
<P>

<i>Q.	I suggest to you that you didn't want anyone to know that she slept in
the same bedroom.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was none of my business.  </i>
<P>

62   	Inconsistently with this answer Mrs King had gone into
quite a deal of detail to describe in her affidavits and in her oral
evidence
the sleeping arrangements of the deceased and Mr Withers that she had observed
over thirty years.  
<P>

63   	During Mrs King's re-examination Mr Hickey asked for and
was granted leave to call some further evidence in chief.  During
that evidence
Mrs King informed me that she knew that her deceased sister had not had a
sexual relationship with Mr Withers because
her sister had told her when they
were discussing pap smears that "as I have not had sexual relations with him in
my life, I hate
the thought of pap smears".  Mrs King said that this
conversation took place after the deceased had been diagnosed with cancer.
<P>

64   	Mrs King said that it was the only conversation about the
sexual relationship that she had with the deceased.  The Court then
adjourned
for the evening and on the following morning Mrs King was further cross
examined.
<P>

65   	It is apparent from that cross examination that after
court Mrs King had a conversation with Mrs Cook, another sister awaiting
to
give evidence, about the evidence that she had just given in respect of the
conversation which became known as the "pap smear
conversation".  Mrs King
admitted that she had been told by her barrister not to speak to other
witnesses whilst she was in cross
examination and she apologised for the error.
She could not explain why she did it but believed she did it on the spur of the
moment.
<P>

66   	She rejected the suggestion made by Mr Young that it was
to alert her sister, Mrs Cook, to the evidence that she had just
given.  
<P>

67   	Mrs King was then cross examined about her failure to
include any suggestion whatsoever about the pap smear conversation in
either of
her affidavits or in her evidence prior to the time that Mr Hickey asked her
when leave was granted to call some further
evidence.  She rejected the
suggestion that it was a desperate attempt to prop up a case that she observed
was becoming very weak.
 
<P>

68   	Mrs King was asked for an explanation as to how this
conversation was not included in her affidavit.  Mrs King's explanation
was
that it was "an oversight".
<P>

69   	It is odd that such an oversight could have occurred
particularly having regard to the fact that this important conversation
had
occurred more recently than the conversations to which Mrs King deposed in her
affidavits which are more peripheral to this issue.
<P>

70   	There was a suggestion in her cross examination that this
was a very private matter but Mrs King did not suggest that this
was the reason
she did not include it in her affidavits or earlier evidence.  She was firm
that it was an "oversight".
<P>

<u>Eva Joan Cook</u>
<P>

71   	Mrs Cook gave evidence after Mrs King and told Mr Young in
cross examination that she did not remember Mrs King talking to
her outside the
courtroom.  Mrs Cook in her cross examination admitted that  the deceased was a
very private person.  The following
evidence is relevant:
<P>

<i>Q	She was not the sort of person who would talk to other people about
whether or not she was having sex with any particular person?</i>
<P>

<i>A	My sister would not say that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Or discuss pap smears with members of the family?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No.</i>
<P>

<u>Mary McAndrew</u>
<P>

72   	In her affidavit Mrs McAndrew gave evidence that she
observed Mr Withers handing money to the deceased at which time he said
"Here's
my board".  It was this aspect of her affidavit upon which Mr Young focused in
some of his cross examination.  That evidence
warrants extracting in this
judgment:
<P>

<i>Q	I suggest to you that the impression that you were trying to create with
par 3 of that affidavit referring to board was that Bill
Withers was no more
than a boarder at the house, is that an accurate assessment of the impression
you are trying to create?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Would you say now that is an accurate impression of the relationship
between Bill Withers and your aunt Agnes as best you know that
relationship?</i>
<P>

<i>A	My aunt had a complex relationship with Mr Withers.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	 We might go back to that matter shortly but would you or would you not
agree that the impression that Bill Withers was no more
than a boarder at the
Condong property is consistent with your knowledge of the actual relationship
between Bill Withers and Agnes
Bray?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	You say that is perfectly consistent do you?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.</i>
<P>

73   	After further cross examination during which Mr Young
probed the detail of Mrs McAndrew's observations of the deceased and
Mr
Withers' relationship including the fact that they slept in the same bedroom
the following evidence was then given:
<P>

<i>Q	That's not the sort of thing that a landlady would do to a mere boarder is
it, sleep in the same bedroom as him?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No that's correct but once again their relationship was very complex and I
am not privy to all that went on.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	Far more complex than a boarder, landlady relationship?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes I would have to agree yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	But whatever money was given and whatever word was attached to it, that
didn't in your mind suggest to you that he was only a boarder
did it?</i>
<P>

<i>A	No.</i>
<P>

74   	Mrs McAndrew also gave evidence that the deceased was very
private and very independent.  She said that she did not regard
her deceased
aunt as a very forthcoming or affectionate person.  She claimed that she was
unsure of what sort of relationship that
the deceased and Mr Withers had but
was of the view that they were fond of one another.  When asked whether she was
of the view that
they were "close" she said that it all depended upon the
definition of close.  When asked about the conversation at the wake she
said
that she didn't remember saying that at all and she didn't think she would have
because of the fact that she was unsure of the
nature of the relationship
between the deceased and Mr Withers.
<P>

75   	The cross claimant, Mrs King, asks the Court to conclude
that there was no sexual relationship between the deceased and Mr
Withers.  It
is submitted that such conclusion can be safely drawn from:
<P>

&#183;	the fact that the deceased and Mr Withers slept in separate rooms and
only later slept 	in the same room for health reasons;
<P>

&#183;	the pap smear conversation Mrs King claimed she had with the deceased;

<P>

&#183;	the separate bank accounts; and 
<P>

&#183;	the fact that it was one of her siblings rather than Mr Withers who was
named as next 	of kin at the hospital.
<P>

76   	The plaintiffs and Mr Withers' daughter-in-law gave
evidence of their observations of the deceased and Mr Withers.  Their
evidence
went to the details of the living arrangements and facts from which I could
draw the conclusion that the deceased and Mr
Withers appeared for many years to
be in a close and emotionally supportive relationship.
<P>

77   	One witness whose evidence I found helpful in determining
this issue was Mrs Julie Annette Dawson who lived next door to the
deceased and
Mr Withers at Condong.  Mrs Dawson regarded herself as a "good friend" of the
deceased.  She told me that she would
be in the deceased's house nearly every
day and I conclude that she had ample opportunity to observe the interaction
between the
deceased and Mr Withers. 
<P>

78   	Mrs Dawson observed that the deceased and Mr Withers were
sleeping in the same room in the single beds for many years well
before Mr
Withers suffered his stroke. I am satisfied that this was the sleeping
arrangement  for many years.  Although Mrs King
may have understood that it was
later in time and that the deceased shared her room with Mr Withers for
"safety" reasons, I am of
the view that it was an arrangement consistent with
the obvious love they had for each other and the desire to be that close.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

79   	Each of the deceased's siblings obviously loved their
sister.  It is however the case that each of them recognised that she
kept her
private life very private.  
<P>

80   	It seems that the deceased may have felt it was
appropriate to inform Mrs King that there was a reason for her to sleep in
the
same room as Mr Withers.  The age difference between Mrs King and the deceased
and the fact that Mrs King had what appears to
have been a child/parent
relationship with the deceased supports the inference that the deceased may
well have kept to herself the
full reasons why she was sleeping in the same
room as Mr Withers. Other factors which lead to such an inference include the
independent
and private personality of the deceased.
<P>

81   	Mrs King rejected the suggestion made to her in cross
examination that she had made the pap smear conversation up to prop
up her
claim.  The curious circumstances surrounding the giving of this evidence and
the fact that it had not been mentioned in any
affidavits, considered with the
whole of Mrs King's evidence, leads me to the conclusion that I could not be
satisfied that Mrs King
accurately recalled the terms of the conversation.  
<P>

82   	On Mrs King's evidence the deceased apparently informed
her that she had only recently moved into the same room as Mr Withers
and for
health reasons.  I have found that this was not the case.  This seems to have
been a method utilised by the deceased to guard
her privacy. Even to accept the
accuracy of the pap smear conversation for the purpose of this analysis I am of
the view that just
as Mrs McAndrew described the relationship as "complex",
there may have been complex reasons for the occurrence of the pap smear
conversation.
<P>

83   	The history of the previous method of guarding her privacy
leads me to the conclusion that even on the basis of an acceptance
of the
accuracy of the conversation, I could not rely on it to make a finding that
there was no sexual relationship between the deceased
and Mr Withers. 
<P>

84   	The overwhelming evidence that the deceased was an
extremely private and not very demonstrative woman suggests to me that
if, as I
have found she did, the deceased slept in the same room as Mr Withers she would
have to have been extremely emotionally
close to him to do so.  The fact that
she referred to  him as "love" and he referred to her as Bid, short for Biddy;
the fact that
he showed off her dress making with obvious pride;  the shared
household and shared interests; notwithstanding the separate bank
accounts, the
intermingling of their finances to purchase the land and house and to run the
house; the sharing of the motor vehicle;
the trips away together visiting their
friends and relatives; the environment in which they entertained the members of
their respective
families; the fact that in the last eighteen years of their
lives they were only apart for a number of days; and that during those
years
they shared a close and, what is more, an obviously interesting, happy and
loving life together satisfies me that more probably
than not the deceased and
Mr Withers had a sexual relationship.
<P>

85   	I am so satisfied without taking into account the contents
of Mr Withers' affidavits.  Of course when one has regard to the
affidavits the
conclusion becomes even more irresistible.
<P>

86   	I am satisfied that the deceased and Mr Withers were in a
de facto relationship for at least the period 1976 to 6 April 1994
and in those
circumstances the estate of Mr Withers becomes entitled to the entirety of the
deceased's estate.
<P>

<b>Order</b>
<P>

87   	Letters of Administration of the estate of the late Agnes
Irene Bray are granted to Brian Joseph Withers and Patrick Bernard
Withers.
The cross claim is dismissed.  I will hear any application in relation to costs
should the parties not be able to agree
on an appropriate order.
