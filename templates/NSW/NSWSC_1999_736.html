<P>

<b>55032/91	AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION PTY LTD  v  ALLCO STEEL
CORPORATION PTY LTD &amp; ANOR </b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	In these proceedings, the plaintiff, Australian Development
Corporation Pty Ltd (ADC), claims damages against the first defendant,
Allco
Steel Corporation Pty Ltd (Allco), for conversion by Allco of two separate
tonnages of steel consisting partly of lengths of
raw steel and also of
portions of steel upon which fabrication work had been performed by Allco.  The
steel had been purchased by
Allco for the performance of a contract with White
Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd (White) for the fabrication and erection of steel
work in a large building project in Canberra known as the Quadrant project.
White had entered into a construction contract, as builder,
with ADC, as
owner/developer of the project.  
<P>

2   	In the proceedings, the two lots of steel were referred to
respectively as the "October steel" and the "November steel".  These
descriptions arose from the fact that the October steel, totalling 503.27
tonnes, was the subject of a progress payment claim made
by Allco in that month
of 1987 and the November steel, totalling 398.57 tonnes, was the subject of a
similar claim in November. 
<P>

3   	Both lots of steel were retained by Allco at its premises
at Tomago near Newcastle, prior to their being used in the construction
work in
Canberra.  After the happening of events which do not require description in
these reasons, the contract between ADC and
White was terminated in August 1988
and the steel, the subject of these proceedings, was sold by Allco in February
and March of 1989.
 The sale was without the consent of ADC which claimed to be
the owner of the steel.
<P>

4   	An order was made in these proceedings by Rolfe J that the
issue of liability be determined separately from the issue of damages.
 In the
liability proceedings, Allco disputed that ADC had title to the steel.  As a
result of decisions made by Rolfe J and by the
Court of Appeal, it has been
held that ADC was the owner of both lots of steel and that Allco converted each
lot by the above referred
to sales.  
<P>

5   	Accordingly, the only issue for my determination is the
quantum of damages to be awarded to ADC against Allco as compensation
for these
torts.
<P>

6   	It has been agreed during the hearing of the proceedings
before me that the amount of fabricated steel converted was in fact
510 tonnes
and the amount of raw steel was 391.84 tonnes.  It has also been agreed that if
I find damages for ADC on the basis that
it was entitled to the reasonable cost
of replacement of the steel, both raw and fabricated, then damages should be
assessed in the
sum of $1,020,155, this being the lesser of two calculations of
damages, on a replacement basis, provided by ADC.
<P>

7   	If I do not find damages on the "replacement" basis, then
the contest between the parties is as to whether I should award damages
based
upon the price obtained by Allco when it sold the steel in 1989 or whether I
should find a higher figure related to calculations
introduced into the case by
ADC by way of expert testimony.  
<P>

8   	It appears that work on the Quadrant project effectively
came to an end in 1987 about 17 months before the sale of the steel
by Allco in
1989.  As already indicated, the head contract was terminated in August 1988.
The steel in question remained at Tomago
throughout this period.  It was stored
in the open at Allco's premises.  It was exposed to the elements which
occasioned some deterioration
through rust.  There was a dispute before me as
to the extent of that deterioration and its effect upon the utility of the
steel
for the Quadrant project or for any other building project.  Part of the
steel had been dealt with for the purpose of producing beams
and columns and
other structural members in conformity with the structural steel plans for the
Quadrant project.  The raw steel which
had been purchased by Allco for use in
the project had, therefore, been modified by its being cut into required
lengths and having
affixed thereto base plates, cleats, and bracing of various
kinds.  Also, holes were drilled in portions of it in conformity with
the
plans.  The remaining raw steel consisted of beams, columns and sheets of
structural steel in certain lengths and thicknesses
which had not been
subjected to fabrication.
<P>

9   	There was some brief and imprecise evidence that certain
types of beams and columns amongst the raw material were of a kind
commonly
used in construction work. However this does not detract from the fact that the
raw steel was specially purchased and appropriated
for use in the Quadrant
project. It was specially identified and specially stored in Allco's premises
for removal to the Quadrant
site when required.
<P>

10   	It was the contention of Allco that by the time the steel
was sold, it was, by and large, in such a deteriorated condition
as to be
unsuitable for use in any major building project.  This deterioration had been
caused by severe rusting.  It was the contention
of ADC that such rusting as
had occurred was not such as to prevent it being used in the Quadrant project
or any similar project.
 The rust could be removed by normal procedures in
Allco's fabrication works and the steel readily brought back to suitable
condition.
 I do not propose to review the whole of the evidence given on this
particular topic.  On Allco's part, evidence was given by Mr
Rowland, who was
the project manager for Allco at the time.  This was supported by Mr Faulkner,
who had purchased the steel on behalf
of Balcomb Recyclers Pty Ltd (Balcomb).
I was not particularly impressed with the evidence of these witnesses.  Mr
Faulkner had to
concede that the description of the steel given in his first
evidentiary statement was quite incorrect.  Mr Rowland, while steadfastly
maintaining the opinion he expressed as to the deteriorated condition of the
steel, was, nevertheless, forced to concede that, had
a proposition, made in
late 1988, that the project should go ahead with Allco dealing directly with
ADC, resulted in agreement, then
the allegedly deteriorated steel would have
been used in the building work.  He would not have taken steps to prevent this
occurring,
despite his views as to the deteriorated condition of the steel.  He
also gave evidence that certain rust flakes tendered in the
case, were typical
of the condition of the surface of the steel.  I found this evidence to be
quite unacceptable.  I do not accept
the evidence of these witnesses as to the
condition of the steel. However I accept that some deterioration had
occurred.
<P>

11   	I am satisfied that the steel, fabricated and
unfabricated, was not in a significantly deteriorated condition.  I am
fortified
in this view by evidence called on behalf of ADC to the effect that
the steel was observed to be carefully and properly stored in
Allco's yard by
Mr Hardie, who had the responsibility of inspecting it on behalf of ADC, to
ensure that it had been purchased by
Allco and allocated to the contract, so
that claims for progress payments could be processed.  Also, compelling
evidence was given
by expert witnesses called by ADC as to the fairly minor
degree of deterioration that might have been expected, having regard to
the
period and nature of its exposure to the elements.  
<P>

12   	As indicated, it was ADC's main contention that its
damages should be assessed in a sum sufficient to cover the cost of replacement
of the steel in its fabricated and raw form.  It also submitted that, in so far
as it might receive, by such an award, an amount
based upon the provision of
new, undeteriorated, steel, then it was entitled to such an award because
Allco, as tortfeasor, had put
it in the position where steel would have to be
re-purchased and re-fabricated in order that it could be restored, so far as
possible,
to the position which it would have occupied had the tort not been
committed.  This approach was contested by Allco.  Accordingly,
it is necessary
to consider, briefly, the law relating to the measure of damages in
conversion.
<P>

13   	In this regard, I have been assisted by the submissions of
counsel during which I was taken to a number of decided cases and
textbook
references.  I need not refer to them in detail.
<P>

14   	It is clear that the normal measure of damages for
conversion is the "value" of the goods converted.  The word "value" is,
of
course, quite ambiguous.  As is said in Ogus - <i>The Law of Damages </i>1973
(at 122):  
<P>

"... "value" as a legal concept has no single ascertainable meaning.  It is one
of those abstract legal words which varies in its
import according to its
context and its purpose within that context.  By itself it offers no guidance
as to how the "valuation" should
be accomplished.  To state, as courts
frequently do in damages cases, that the plaintiff is entitled to "the value of
his property"
is not to conclude the inquiry as to the assessment of
compensation but to commence it."
<P>

15   	It is also clear that there is no hard and fast rule that,
in all cases where a plaintiff's goods have been converted so that
they cannot
be returned to him, he is entitled to damages from the defendant based upon the
cost of replacement of the goods.  This
is demonstrated quite clearly in the
decision of the High Court in <b>Butler v Egg and Egg Pulp Marketing Board</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20114%20CLR%20185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 114 CLR 185</a>, where the Court refused to award to the Board the total
cost of eggs to which it was statutorily entitled, but which had been converted
by their sale by the producer to a third party.  It was said by Taylor and Owen
JJ (at 191) that the "principle is that the injured
party should receive
compensation in a sum which, so far as money can do so, will put him in the
same position as he would have been
in if the contract had been performed or
the tort had not been committed ... And this principle is as much applicable to
actions
of conversion as it is to the case of other actionable wrongs.  In most
cases of conversion it is, of course, obvious that its application
will result
in the injured plaintiff recovering the full value of the property converted
since that will usually represent the loss
that he has sustained by the
defendant's wrongful act.  Hence the statement which appears so often in the
books that the general
rule is that the plaintiff in an action of conversion is
entitled to recover the full value of the goods converted, but this statement
should not be allowed to obscure the broad principle that damages are awarded
by way of compensation."
<P>

16   	In the same case, Menzies J said (at 192):
<P>

     "There is no hard and fast rule that the value of the goods at the time of
a conversion is always the measure of the damages
to be assessed for the
conversion.  Often the application of such a rule would produce an obviously
unjust result - for example,
if goods converted by a defendant had since been
recovered by the plaintiff-owner.  The true rule is, I think, that stated by
Bramwell
B. in <i>Chinery v. Viall</i>, viz. that the plaintiff is entitled to
recover no more than the real damage he has sustained."
<P>

17   	I should also make reference to two earlier cases which
are relied upon by ADC to support the proposition that the appropriate
award of
damages in the present case is one that will provide "replacement" value to the
plaintiff, it being submitted that such
an award is necessary to provide it
with restitutio in integrum.  
<P>

18   	The first case is <b>The Mediana </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20AC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] AC 113.</a>  This
did not involve an action in conversion.  However, the speeches contain
statements which have had a bearing upon awards of
damages for that tort.  A
lightship belonging to a harbour board was damaged by the negligence of the
appellant.  The board substituted
another lightship for the damaged lightship
during the period that repairs were being effected.  The substitute lightship
was regularly
maintained and kept in reserve to meet such an emergency.  The
cost of maintaining it would have been required whether or not it
was used for
that purpose.  The question was whether a head of damage for "hire of the
services" of the substitute lightship could
be recovered.  The following
passage appears in the speech of the Earl of Halsbury LC (at 117):
<P>

"Now, in the particular case before us, apart from a circumstance which I will
refer to immediately, the broad proposition seems
to me to be that by a
wrongful act of the defendants the plaintiffs were deprived of their vessel.
When I say deprived of their vessel,
I will not use the phrase "the use of the
vessel."  What right has a wrongdoer to consider what use you are going to make
of your
vessel?  More than one case has been put to illustrate this:  for
example, the owner of a horse, or of a chair.  Supposing a person
took away a
chair out of my room and kept it for twelve months, could anybody say you had a
right to diminish the damages by shewing
that I did not usually sit in that
chair, or that there were plenty of other chairs in the room?  The proposition
so nakedly stated
appears to me to be absurd; but a jury have very often a very
difficult task to perform in ascertaining what should be the amount
of damages
of that sort.  I know very well that as a matter of common sense what an
arbitrator or a jury very often do is to take
a perfectly artificial hypothesis
and say, "Well, if you wanted to hire a chair, what would you have to give for
it for the period";
and in that way they come to a rough sort of conclusion as
to what damages ought to be paid for the unjust and unlawful withdrawal
of it
from the owner.  Here, as I say, the broad principle seems to me to be quite
independent of the particular use the plaintiffs
were going to make of the
thing that was taken, except - and this I think has been the fallacy running
through the arguments at the
bar - when you are endeavouring to establish the
specific loss of profit, or of something that you otherwise would have got
which
the law recognises as special damage."
<P>

19   	These remarks of Lord Halsbury were considered by Lord
Roche in <b>Caxton Publishing Co Ltd v Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1939%5d%20AC%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1939]
AC 178</a> at 192 where he said of the measure of damages in conversion:
<P>

"There is no dispute but that the measure of damages is the value of the thing
converted at the time of the conversion.  It is true
enough to say that the
value is the value to the owner; but it is wrong to say this if you mean what
the owner will make out of the
thing in money if it is not taken away from him.
This latter idea was repelled by this House in a series of cases dealing with
such
trespasses to goods as deprived the owner of them temporarily.  They were
cases where the owner either did not use the things at
all or not for money
gain, for example, spare lightships and dredgers.  <i>The Mediana</i> is an
instance.  It was said in the judgment of Lord Halsbury L.C. in that case that,
if the owner of a chair was deprived of it,
it was no ground for giving nominal
damages that he did not want to sit upon it: and that it might be necessary in
such cases to
resort to a variety of tests of value during the time of
deprivation ... So with permanent deprivation or wrongful appropriation
of a
chattel one of a variety of tests may be the best available test of value
according to circumstances."
<P>

20   	The case of <b>J &amp; E Hall Ltd v Barclay</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%203%20All%20ER%20620" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 3
All ER 620</a> is, perhaps, the most closely analogous to the present one.  It is
heavily relied upon by ADC.  In it the respondent company had
worked for the
appellant in the erection and testing of experimental davits of which the
appellant was the inventor.  After experiments
had been conducted, the davits
were dismantled.  They were kept by the respondent company for a number of
years.  It then sold them
as scrap.  The appellant claimed damages for
conversion and, at first instance, was awarded their scrap value as damages.
It was
held on appeal, however, that the appropriate measure of damages was the
cost of replacement.  Greer LJ (at 623), having said that
the proper measure of
damages was the value of the converted article, then said:  "Then the question
is, what is the meaning of "the
value of that article"?"  Having indicated that
"a man whose rights have been interfered with is never entitled to more than
what
he would have to pay to buy a similar article in the market", his Lordship
then turned to consider what the appropriate measure should
be in circumstances
where there was no available market.  He said (at 624):
<P>

     "Now, if there had been a market for the davits, to which the appellant
could have gone on the day after he was wrongfully
deprived of his davits, and
bought them at an agreed price, however much lower that might be or however
much higher it might be than
what he had originally paid for them, he would
have been entitled to the cost of replacement by getting them in the market.
But,
if he cannot get them in the market, what is his position?  He must do
that which is analogous to getting them in the market, namely,
he must go to
the only people from whom he can get goods to put him into the same position as
he would have been in if his davits
had never been taken away from him, that is
to say, he must go to the manufacturer and see for what price the manufacturer
will supply
him with similar goods ...  [The plaintiff was] entitled as of
right ... to say, "I want my goods.  If you do not give me back my
goods, then
you must pay me what I would have to pay in order to put myself into the same
position as I would have been in if you
had complied with my demand for the
goods.  I want them for the purposes of further experiments, in order that I
may satisfy myself
that the design of these davits, and possibly the design of
improved davits, may be improved upon."
<P>

21   	The plaintiff was, accordingly, entitled to receive as
damages the cost of the re-manufacture of the davits.
<P>

22   	It is to be noted that the passage quoted refers
specifically to the fact that the plaintiff wanted to use the davits for
further experiments.  In such circumstances, it was inappropriate to regard
them as scrap metal.
<P>

23   	This case has been the subject of comment in leading
texts.  Thus in <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, 15th Ed., at 808, the learned
author says that in <b>Hall v Barclay</b>, the plaintiff was not limited to the
scrap value of the davits "but could recover the cost of obtaining replacements
in the absence
of a market in which such goods could be bought ready made.
There was evidence that the plaintiff would want to use such replacements
so
that he could not be said to be claiming on the basis of replacement value just
in order that the defendant should pay him damages."
<P>

24   	In Ogus (op cit) at 145, the learned author cites the case
for this proposition:  "Failing this, (ie being able to acquire
a substitute in
the market) the plaintiff may recover the cost of manufacturing a suitable
substitute.  But for this method to be
applicable, the plaintiff must show that
he intended actually to use and benefit from the article which is to be
reproduced - otherwise
the reproduction cost will not be a true measure of his
loss."
<P>

25   	In my view, these statements should be accepted as
correct.  They put a necessary gloss upon the wide statement of principle,
if
that is what it was intended to be, in the passage from Lord Halsbury's speech
in <b>The Mediana</b>.<b>  </b>In my opinion, if goods have been specially
manufactured or specially acquired to be used by a person in a particular way,
and they
are converted by a tortfeasor then, if, at the time of conversion, the
person required those goods for their original purpose, it
follows that<b>
</b>he can be restored to his original position only by an award of damages
that would cover the replacement cost of those goods.  If,
however, prior to
the conversion he had ceased to have that special need for those goods, then to
award him damages based upon the
cost of re-manufacturing or re-acquiring those
goods would be to compensate him on a false basis.  At the time of the
conversion
the goods would not have been of their original use to him; they
would have had some other use which might be radically different
from the
original one.  In my opinion, conformably with the general principles
applicable to awards of compensatory damages, proper
regard must be paid to
such a pre-conversion change of use in order to arrive at the correct "value"
of converted goods.
<P>

26   	I am aware that <b>Hall v Barclay</b><i> </i> was
concerned only with goods specially manufactured for a particular purpose and
not with goods specially acquired for that purpose.
However, it would, I
believe, be inconsistent with the underlying compensatory principle for damages
in tort, and unnecessarily artificial,
to apply the decision only to items
specially manufactured by a person for a particular purpose. 
<P>

27   	In the present case, in my opinion, if the evidence
requires the conclusion that, as at the date of its conversion, the
fabricated<b> </b>steel, which had been specially worked upon for use by ADC in
the Quadrant project and the raw steel which had been specially acquired
for
the project<b>,</b> was no longer required for that project, then to award
damages based upon cost of replacement would be quite erroneous.  That is,
unless there was a demonstrated use for the steel by the plaintiff in some
other project.  Failing that, the steel in the plaintiff's
hands would be
surplus to its requirements and would have a pre-conversion value based upon
its sale price as steel.  
<P>

28   	This is the position contended for by Allco.  It is
necessary to see whether the evidence supports it.
<P>

29   	The following evidence was given by Mr Schick, the
quantity surveyor employed by ADC for the Quadrant project:
<P>

"Q.  ...  Do you know from your own observations, Mr Schick, as to whether the
residential tower was constructed using materials
other than steel?
<P>

A.  It was constructed using reinforced concrete.
<P>

Q.  In other words the engineering detail for the construction of the
residential tower altered from one requiring the steel that
Allco purchased in
to one not using steel but using reinforced concrete?
<P>

A.  That's correct.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  When was that change made, do you know?
<P>

A.  Lindsay Mack (of) Group Architects and myself discussed the possibility of
it shortly before the termination of the contract.
<P>

Q.  Around about August of 1988, some time then?
<P>

A.  Your Honour, I am not sure of the date but it was during the period of the
strike and when it appeared as though the contract
may be terminated.
<P>

Q.  So, it was before the termination of the contract but during the period of
the strike when it seemed as though the contract
was to be terminated?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  The discussion with Mr Mack?
<P>

A.  We suggested A D C as a way of overcoming some problems that we foresaw and
saving some height in the floor to floor --
<P>

McVAY:  Q.  Whatever the reason, there was a change in the method of
construction and apparently in the design of the building?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  It then no longer involved the use of this prefabricated steel?
<P>

A.  That's correct.
<P>

Q.  Which was then at Tomago?
<P>

A.  That's correct."
<P>

30   	In re-examination he gave the following evidence:
<P>

"LINEY:  Q.  Just on that last point, Mr Schick, I ask you to assume for a
moment that the relevant authorities' approval to proceed
in reinforced
concrete rather than steel was not granted until about April, in fact until
April 1989.  Now, are you able to say until
the approval for that was granted
could the building have proceeded in reinforced concrete rather than structural
steel -
<P>

OBJECTION.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  Are you able to answer that?
<P>

A.  The authorities certainly would not allow that construction to proceed
until the revised structural design.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  They would have to approve the new plan and new construction.
<P>

LINEY:  Q.  So from somebody advising the proprietor and developer and looking
at costs is one in a position to make a final decision
on whether to proceed
with reinforced concrete until one has the authorities' approval with all the
relevant conditions -
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  I will allow it.
<P>

WITNESS:  A.  In fairness I suppose when the drawings are complete you could go
out and get quotes and if my estimates have been
shown to be incorrect perhaps
A D C may have reverted back to steel but they did proceed with concrete.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  These things are done more or less contemporaneously?
<P>

A.  The drawings have to be completed and they are submitted.  It frequently
takes in excess of six weeks in Canberra to get plans
through the
authorities.
<P>

<strike>LINEY</strike>:  Q.  It does not come to a grinding halt?
<P>

A.  No.  There was other work on the site going on.  The office block was
completed in steel.  That work continued but the residence
and the carpark
remained inactive.
<P>

Q.  They were put on hold?
<P>

A.  That's correct.
<P>

Q.  The point was, as it were, is assuming one is thinking about changing to
concrete instead of steel can any such decision be
made with any finality prior
to the seeking of authorities' approval with all relevant conditions?
<P>

A.  No, I don't think you would make a decision until you knew all the
conditions.
<P>

Q.  And prior to April 1989 did any officer or employee of A D C ever say to
you that such a final decision had been made - 
<P>

OBJECTION.  RELEVANCE.  ALLOWED.
<P>

A.  I wasn't told the final decision had been made."
<P>

31   	Further evidence on the topic appears in a letter of 12
March 1990 sent by ADC's solicitors to Allco.  The letter addressed
the
allegation previously made by Allco that all steel purchased by it for the
Quadrant project had been delivered to the site in
Canberra.  It stated:
<P>

"In particular, it notes that no steel had been delivered to the project site
since the identification by its quantity surveyors
in early November 1987 and
December 1987 respectively of steel at your company's Tomago yard worth
$503,270.00 and $398,570.00 respectively
as referred to in the said letter.  We
are instructed that the steel in question was ultimately not required to be
used on the site
due to the fact that the building for which it had been
intended was changed to a concrete structure."
<P>

32   	No further evidence was given on this aspect of the case.
In particular, no evidence was given in support of the assumption
that Mr
Schick was asked to make in re-examination as to the granting of approvals by
relevant authorities and as to the time of
such grant.  What, then, is the
effect of this evidence?
<P>

33   	It is clear that the steel, the subject of these
proceedings, was not required for the completion of the Quadrant project.
Obviously a decision was made by ADC to proceed with a different form of
construction, at which point it ceased to need the steel
for that purpose.  Did
this change in the use of the steel occur before the time of its conversion?
This would appear to be the fine
point upon which the appropriate measure of
damage depends.
<P>

34   	I have come to the conclusion, not without some
hesitation, having regard to the state of the evidence, that the steel, at
the
time of its conversion, was no longer required by ADC for the Quadrant project.
I consider this to be the ultimate effect of
the evidence set out.  Mr Schick
was an impressive witness.  I am satisfied that his evidence points, with
sufficient clarity, to
the "change in the method of construction and ... in the
design of the building" having occurred when the prefabricated steel was
still
at Tomago, that is, before its conversion.
<P>

35   	In these circumstances, I reject the primary claim of ADC
that its damages should be calculated on the replacement value of
the converted
steel.  There is no evidence to suggest that ADC would have had any use for the
steel in its specially cut and fabricated
state.  Likewise, there is no
evidence that the remaining raw steel was of any use to ADC. In my view, the
only reasonable inference
on the evidence is that it would have taken steps to
dispose of the steel.  In view of the fact that it had paid, through its
contract
with White, progress payments for the steel amounting to $901,840, it
is reasonable to assume that it would have taken steps to recover
the best
possible price available.
<P>

36   	For this reason, I am not prepared to accept the
submissions made on behalf of Allco that the appropriate price to take was
the
amount received by it on its sale of the steel to Balcomb, namely $335,171.  It
was argued that this figure represented the proper
value of the steel as it was
the amount of the highest tender received when Allco sought to sell the steel
into the re-useable steel
market.  It sold the steel into that market on an "as
is - where is" basis.  Balcomb was the highest tenderer.
<P>

37   	Plainly, the steel, being a significantly large lot,
occupied considerable space in Allco's premises.  Allco was anxious to
have it
removed and, apparently, had no desire to maximise the price obtained.  In
selling to Balcomb, it sold to a dealer in scrap
and re-useable steel.  It is
clear from the evidence that Balcomb thereafter made profits from on-selling
the steel into smaller
more specialised markets, where steel in somewhat
deteriorated condition and in non-uniform shapes and lengths could be used for
particular purposes.   
<P>

38   	The evidence makes it clear that other avenues for the
commercial disposal of the steel were available other than selling
it as a
single lot to a dealer such as Balcomb.  Very elaborate evidence was given on
behalf of ADC by Mr Thornton, a quantity surveyor,
who, by reason of careful
examination of the structural steel plans for the Quadrant project and other
documents, estimated the quantities
and configurations of the steel that would
have been the subject of the sale by Balcomb.  Mr Dean, a steel merchant and
broker, then
gave evidence as to the prices he would have expected to achieve
in the market for steel so described.  The resulting figure was
$598,515.73.
This figure would have been achieved by careful selling of the steel into
selected markets.
<P>

39   	This is not an area where precise computation is possible.
Assumptions should not be made in favour of a tortfeasor who has
converted
another's property.  In particular, it is not to be assumed that ADC would have
chosen the method of disposal followed
by Allco.  On the other hand, it is
unlikely that it would have undertaken sale of the steel as though it were
itself a dealer or
broker.  It is clear, for instance, that if it had sold the
steel to Mr Dean, the price achieved would have been considerably less
than the
prices that Mr Dean would have expected to achieve when on-selling.  In my
view, in circumstances where accurate calculation
of damages is impossible or
inappropriate, the Court must, as a jury would, "give whatever (it thinks)
would be the proper equivalent
for the unlawful withdrawal of the
subject-matter then in question"(per Earl of Halsbury LC in <b>The Mediana
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20AC%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] AC 113</a> at 118.)   
<P>

40   	Approaching the problem in this way, and using the figures
from the evidence as guides, I consider that the proper amount
to award the
plaintiff for damages for the conversion of its steel is $475,000.  
<P>

41   	I think it reasonable to add that, had I proceeded along
the path of replacement cost as being the appropriate measure, it
would have
been necessary to take into account that the steel was stored in Allco's yard.
ADC had no entitlement to keep it there.
 Accordingly, in my view, the damages
would have been subject to reduction, to a quite substantial extent, to allow
for the cost
of removal of the steel from Allco's premises.  There is evidence
in the case, to which I need not refer in detail, that it was a
lengthy,
labour-intensive and necessarily costly process for Balcomb to remove the steel
from the Tomago site.  Moreover, some further
reduction would have been
required having regard to the somewhat deteriorated condition of the steel.
<P>

42   	As I indicated at the termination of the hearing, I will
give counsel the opportunity to argue the question of interest and
costs.
Accordingly, I direct that within 14 days of the handing down of these reasons
that counsel approach my Associate for the
purpose of fixing a mutually
convenient time for the disposal of those issues.
