<b>12770/94 - STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LIMITED v SULLIVAN &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The plaintiff, the State Bank of New South
Wales Limited ("the Bank") brought these proceedings, claiming judgment for an
amount
alleged to be due under a mortgage dated 16 November 1990 from the
defendant, Donald Charles Sullivan ("Mr Sullivan") to the Bank
("the mortgage")
of land situated in Queensland known as 23 Foxhill Court, Carrara, and being
the land comprised in Queensland Certificate
of Title Vol.7176 Folio 175 ("the
land") and for judgment for possession of the land.  In his defence and
cross-claim, as originally
filed, Mr Sullivan alleged that the contract
consisting of the mortgage was unjust in the circumstances relating to it at
the time
it was made within the meaning of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act 1980</a>
(NSW)</i> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a>"). No reply or defence to Mr Sullivan's
cross-claim was filed by the Bank at any time before the commencement of the
hearing of the
proceedings.  On the first day of the hearing, or only shortly
before, the Bank's legal advisers raised for the first time with Mr
Sullivan's
legal advisers the possibility that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> did not
apply to the mortgage, it being a mortgage of land situated in Queensland which
had been registered in Queensland.  I decided
that the Bank should be permitted
to contend that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> did not apply to the mortgage
but indicated that the pleadings should be amended.
<P>

2  	Subsequently, Mr Sullivan's defence and cross-claim were amended
so as to include:-
<P>

3  	(i)	A defence that it was a term of the mortgage or of the
arrangement leading to the execution of the mortgage that there would
be a
collateral equitable mortgage from a company named Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited
("Nobsa") in favour of the Bank but that no such
equitable mortgage from Nobsa
had been executed and that consequently Mr Sullivan was relieved of all
liability to the Bank.
<P>

4  	(ii)	A cross-claim that the mortgage was entered into in
circumstances that were unconscionable under the general law or s51AB
(formerly
s52A) of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> (Commonwealth<i>)</i>.
<P>

5  	A reply and a defence to the amended cross-claim were filed by
the Bank, in which the Bank alleged that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> did
not apply to the mortgage and in which the Bank disputed the defences and
claims made by Mr Sullivan.   A reply to the defence
to the amended cross-claim
was filed on behalf of Mr Sullivan, in which it was alleged that the Bank was
estopped from alleging that
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> did not apply to
the mortgage.
<P>

6  	Apart from the pleadings between the Bank and Mr Sullivan, each
of the Bank and Mr Sullivan brought a cross-claim against Mr
Peter Urquhart
McKenzie Williams ("Mr Williams"), on the basis that Mr Williams had been Mr
Sullivan's solicitor when Mr Sullivan
entered into the mortgage.  In its
cross-claim the Bank alleged that Mr Williams had owed a duty to his client Mr
Sullivan, that
Mr Williams knew or ought to have known that the Bank would be
relying upon him to properly carry out his duty to Mr Sullivan and
that
accordingly Mr Williams owed a duty to the Bank to act carefully in carrying
out his duty as Mr Sullivan's solicitor and that
if the allegations made by Mr
Sullivan in his cross-claim against the Bank were true, Mr Williams had
breached that duty.  A defence
to this cross claim was filed on behalf of Mr
Williams, in which Mr Williams disputed most of the allegations made in the
cross-claim
and alleged that the Bank had been guilty of contributory
negligence.
<P>

7  	In his cross-claim Mr Sullivan alleged that Mr Williams had owed
him a duty of care, which had been breached.  A defence to
this cross-claim was
filed on behalf of Mr Williams, in which Mr Williams disputed most of the
allegations made in Mr Sullivan's
cross-claim and alleged that Mr Sullivan had
been guilty of contributory negligence.
<P>

8  	The actual course of the pleadings between the various parties
was somewhat more complicated than I have indicated but the above
summary
substantially reflects what happened.
<P>

9  	The following facts, taken mainly from Mr Sullivan's principal
affidavit of 11 August 1997, are uncontroversial.
<P>

10  	Mr Sullivan was born on 28 January 1923 at Lambton near
Newcastle.  He left school at the age of fourteen years.  After leaving
school
he worked for a number of years as a sheet metal worker.  In the mid 1950's he
became employed by the Australian Labor Party
as a State organiser and remained
in this employment until 1977.  He worked for the New South Wales Department of
Industrial Relations
between 1977 and January 1989, when he retired. Since then
he has been a pensioner.
<P>

11  	At some time in the 1970's Mr Sullivan formed a relationship
with a woman named Marjory Kelly.  Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly never
married,
although while they were in a relationship Mrs Kelly used the name "Sullivan".
When she gave evidence at the hearing, Mrs
Kelly used her maiden name, Marjory
Craig.  It will be convenient to refer to her as either "Mrs Kelly" or "Marjory
Craig".  The
relationship between Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly ended at some time
after Mr Sullivan had entered into the mortgage and no later than
some time in
1991.
<P>

12  	Mrs Kelly had a son, Craig Kelly, who was born in about 1957.
In about 1985 Craig Kelly became the part-owner of a restaurant
at Gymea known
as "The Cascades Restaurant" ("the restaurant").  The other part-owner was a Mr
Ahmet.  The business of the restaurant
was actually carried on by the company
Nobsa, in which Craig Kelly and Mr Ahmet held shares.  From about 1987 Nobsa
conducted its
banking with the Bank.  
<P>

13  	At some time in the 1980's Mr Sullivan, at the request of Craig
Kelly, gave a guarantee to the Bank of a loan made by the Bank.
 Mr Sullivan's
liability under the guarantee was limited to a fixed amount.  The guarantee was
in force for only a limited time and
was then released by the Bank.
<P>

14  	In 1988 Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly bought the land in Foxhill
Court, Carrara as tenants in common.  A house was built on the
land.  During
the building of the house Mr Sullivan purchased Mrs Kelly's share in the land.
Mrs Kelly lent the purchase money she
received to her son Craig Kelly.  From
October 1989 Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly lived in the house which had been built
on the land.
 After the breakdown of the relationship between Mr Sullivan and
Mrs Kelly, Mr Sullivan continued to live in the house and he has
continued
living in the house up until the present.
<P>

15  	After they commenced living in Queensland Mr Sullivan and Mrs
Kelly from time to time visited Craig Kelly, staying at Craig
Kelly's house at
Gymea.  While they were in Sydney, Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly helped out at the
restaurant.  The work done by Mr
Sullivan consisted of general kitchen duties,
delivering advertising leaflets and doing some banking for Nobsa.  While he was
at
the restaurant, Mr Sullivan met the cross-defendant Mr Williams of Messrs
Gray &amp; Perkins, who was the solicitor for Craig Kelly
and Nobsa and also
met Mr Weidenhofer of Messrs Rost &amp; Kitchener, who was the accountant for
Craig Kelly and Nobsa.
<P>

16  	Nobsa had a current account with the Bank which was overdrawn
and a leasing account.  The indebtedness of Nobsa to the Bank
was secured by a
mortgage over Craig Kelly's property at Gymea and a mortgage over Mr Ahmet's
property at Kirrawee.
<P>

17  	At some time in the second half of 1990 Mr Sullivan was informed
by Craig Kelly that Mr Ahmet wished to leave the business
of the restaurant and
that Craig Kelly wished to acquire Mr Ahmet's interest in the business and that
if Mr Ahmet was to leave the
business on the basis that the mortgage over his
property to the Bank was discharged, the Bank would require some other security
to be substituted for the mortgage of Mr Ahmet's property.  Craig Kelly
suggested to Mr Sullivan that he should give a mortgage over
the land in
Queensland, to take the place of the mortgage over Mr Ahmet's property.  Later
in this judgment I will examine in more
detail some of the evidence about the
conversations between Mr Sullivan and Craig Kelly.  Some of this evidence is
contentious. 
Mr Sullivan did agree to give a mortgage over the land and the
Bank consented to releasing the security from Mr Ahmet, on the basis
that a
mortgage of the land from Mr Sullivan would be substituted for the security
from Mr Ahmet.
<P>

18  	On 14 November 1990 Mr Sullivan, Craig Kelly and Mrs Kelly went
to Mr Williams' office, where they had a meeting with Mr Williams.
 At the
meeting Mr Sullivan signed the mortgage on which the Bank is suing, together
with a number of other documents.  What was
said at the meeting is contentious
and I will examine evidence about the meeting in more detail later in this
judgment.
<P>

19  	On 16 November 1990 Mr Ahmet transferred his shares in Nobsa to
Mrs Kelly.  The mortgage which had been signed by Mr Sullivan
on 14 November
1990 was dated as of 16 November 1990.  On 19 March 1991 the mortgage was
registered at the Queensland Land Titles
Office.
<P>

20  	By notice dated 20 March 1991 the Bank gave notice to Mr
Sullivan that default had occurred under the mortgage and unless the
amount of
$312,633.99 due under the mortgage was paid, the Bank would exercise its powers
under the mortgage.
<P>

21  	In 1991 it was proposed by Craig Kelly that the indebtedness of
Nobsa to the Bank be re-financed by a loan from another financier
but Mr
Sullivan, after taking advice from his present solicitor Mr Dobson, declined to
sign the re-financing documents.
<P>

22  	Nobsa defaulted under both the overdraft account and the leasing
account.  On 19 October 1993 an order was made for the winding
up of Nobsa.  On
22 November 1993 Craig Kelly was made bankrupt.  The present proceedings were
commenced by the Bank against Mr Sullivan
in 1994.  
<P>

23  	In Mr Sullivan's principal affidavit he gave further evidence,
which is controversial, even though most of it was not directly
contradicted by
any affidavit evidence from either the Bank or Mr Williams.
<P>

24  	In par15 of his affidavit Mr Sullivan said that when Craig Kelly
approached him about giving a security over the land in Queensland,
Craig Kelly
said, "my house will be sold by January or February and I will not need your
property's security any longer.  It will
be like the other one, you will be
released after a couple of months".  Mr Sullivan asserted that he agreed to put
up his property
as security, on the basis that it would be released within
three months.  
<P>

25  	Mr Sullivan's account of what happened at the meeting in Mr
Williams' office is set out in par19 of his affidavit, which was
in the
following terms:-
<P>

"I recollect being ushered into Williams' office by his secretary with Craig
Kelly and Marjorie.  We all took a seat and then Craig
Kelly said to Peter
Williams words to the effect: `Well you know my parents' to which Peter
Williams replied `Yes'.  Peter Williams
then said words to the effect: `You
have agreed to mortgage your house at Carrara so as to release Jimmy Ahmet's
house at Kirrawee.
 You understand what this is all about'.  I said `I think
so.  Why doesn't Craig give me something to protect my interest?'  Marjorie
said `Well it is all in the family'.  I said `Alright'.  Peter Williams then
proceeded to have me sign a number of documents.  The
documents were in a
bundle.  Williams removed the documents one at a time, the documents that I was
to sign.  He placed his finger
on the portion of the particular document where
I was to sign and I signed or initialled the relevant parts.  After I had
signed
and initialled all the documents I saw Craig and Marjorie sign and
initial a number of documents.  A stamp was then put on some of
the documents.
Williams then said words to the effect `Thank you'.  A number of pleasantries
were exchanged and we all left."
<P>

26  	Paragraph 20 of Mr Sullivan's affidavit was in the following
terms.
<P>

"At the meeting referred to in paragraph 19 I was not provided with copies of
any of the documents I signed either before or after
the meeting.  I understood
that my property was to be used as security for only three months.  Mr Williams
did not explain to me,
at any stage, that I was guaranteeing a debt owed by the
company Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited nor any of the financial difficulties
that
that company was experiencing.  I was not asked by Peter Williams whether I
understood the nature and effect of the documents.
 I was not asked by Peter
Williams whether I had compared my obligations and responsibilities to the bank
with those of any other
person named in the document and as to whether I had
considered the consequences to me should there be any default in those
obligations
and responsibilities.  I was not asked whether I was signing the
documents voluntarily".
<P>

27  	Mr Sullivan said that in 1991 he received a letter from
solicitors acting for the Bank, demanding payment of a substantial
sum of
money.  About a week later there was a meeting between Mr Sullivan, Craig
Kelly, Mrs Kelly, Mr Williams and Mr Weidenhofer.
 Mr Sullivan alleged that Mr
Williams said, "I doubt if they can do anything about this.  They should have
sent you to another solicitor
as they knew I was Craig's solicitor and not
yours". 
<P>

28  	In his affidavit Mr Sullivan said that he had not been aware
that the restaurant business was in financial difficulties, until
he had
received the letter of demand from the Bank's solicitors in March 1991.  He
asserted that if he had been informed that Nobsa
owed the Bank the sum of
$270,000, then he would not have entered into a mortgage.
<P>

29  	An affidavit was filed on behalf of the Bank by Mr Gilbert
Thomas Lyons, a former officer of the Bank.  
<P>

30  	In his affidavit Mr Lyons said that in 1990 he was the relieving
manager at the Sutherland Branch of the Bank for approximately
one month.  Mr
Lyons annexed to his affidavit a copy of a Bank document headed "Application
for Advance/Review", which was a communication
from the Sutherland Branch to
the Regional Manager, Metropolitan South Region, seeking approval of the
proposal in the application
and a copy of a further Bank document headed
"Supplement to Application for Advance/Review".  The application was prepared
and signed
by Mr Lyons and was dated 14 September 1990.  The purpose of the
application was stated to be "a review of accounts and substitution
of security
(for Cascades Restaurant)".  The application included a statement of the
financial position of Nobsa, showing a deficiency
in shareholders' funds of
$158,081.  
<P>

31  	Paragraph 19 of the application included the following:-
<P>

"It is now realised that business cannot support both Ahmet and Kelly.
<P>

The proposal is that Ahmet withdraws as director of Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited
to be replaced by Kelly's mother, Mrs MM Sullivan.
<P>

Ahmet's security property would be released and replaced by an unencumbered
property at Carrara (Gold Coast) QLD owned by Kelly's
step-father, DC Kelly who
has been fully appraised of situation if default should occur.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

SUBMISSION:- for approval to
<P>

1.	Substitute existing registered 1st 3rd party mortgage over land &amp;
dwelling 394 President Avenue, KIRRAWEE by registered 1st
3rd party mortgage
over land and dwelling 23 Fox Hill Court CARRARA (Gold Coast) QLD (deeds to be
lodged) and registered Equitable
Mortgage and Floating Charge over assets and
Undertakings of Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited...
<P>

2.	Carry current account debt to $250,000 subject to:-
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

(e)	Further review once result of auction due 13/10/90 is known.  Branch to
closely follow up.
<P>

(f)	Current account debt not to exceed $250,000".
<P>

32  	Mr Lyons said in his affidavit, and it is clear, that "DC Kelly"
is an error for DC Sullivan.
<P>

33  	In the supplement to the application "the existing security" is
stated to be a mortgage over the property at Kirrawee and the
mortgage over
Craig Kelly's property at Gymea and "the proposed security" is stated to be a
mortgage over the land (Mr Sullivan's
property in Queensland), the existing
mortgage over Craig Kelly's property at Gymea and a registered equitable
mortgage and floating
charge over the assets and undertaking of Nobsa.
<P>

34  	In the supplement to the application the position of the
accounts of "Cascades Restaurant", Nobsa and Craig Kelly are shown.
 The
overdraft account of Nobsa was overdrawn $251,973, as against stated overdraft
limit of $190,000.  Craig Kelly on his personal
accounts with the Bank owed
approximately $310,000.
<P>

35  	The supplement contains comments on "repayment capacity",
including the following:-
<P>

"Cash flow has been prepared on basis of sale proceeds, after repayment of
Kelly's debits, of $150,000.  This would be the result
of the sale price of
$490,000 (after allowing $20,000 for agent's commission and stamp duty).
Property is to go to auction on 13/10/90
with a reserve of $550,000.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

Mrs Sullivan is providing $40,000 capital to assist her son.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

However, if business is to able to trade out of its present difficulties the
present debt level must be reduced drastically. This
can only be achieved by
successful sale of Kelly's property.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

Position will need to be reviewed once results of auction are known".
<P>

36  	Mr Lyons said in his affidavit that he had prepared the
application from documents in the Bank's files and from a meeting with
Craig
Kelly, Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly, which was held a day or so before the date of
the application, that is 14 September 1990.
  Mr Lyons said in his affidavit
that he could recall giving an explanation of a third party mortgage at the
meeting and that he
said to Mr Sullivan words to the effect of "the property at
Carrara, Queensland could be sold up by the Bank if the company defaults".
<P>

37  	An affidavit by Mr Sullivan in reply to Mr Lyons' affidavit was
filed.  In his affidavit Mr Sullivan said that he could recall
having a meeting
with a representative of the Bank, before he entered into the mortgage.
However, he said that this meeting had taken
place within two weeks of Mr
Sullivan signing the mortgage and had not taken place on or about 14 September
1990.  He said that the
meeting had been with the manager of the Sutherland
Branch, who was not Mr Lyons, that Craig Kelly and Mrs Kelly were not present,
that the meeting lasted only a few minutes and that at the meeting no
explanation of a third party mortgage had been given.
<P>

38  	A number of affidavits were filed on behalf of Mr Williams, the
cross-defendant to the cross-claims by the Bank and Mr  Sullivan.
 
<P>

39  	In his own affidavit of 3 July 1997 Mr Williams said that he had
received instructions on 31 August 1990 from Craig Kelly,
in relation to a
proposal that Mr Ahmet sell his shares in Nobsa to Mrs Kelly. Mr Williams said
that those instructions included
that Mr Ahmet was to pay Craig Kelly $50,000
and that Mr Sullivan was prepared to provide security to guarantee Nobsa's
indebtedness
to the Bank by mortgaging a property owned by him in Queensland.

<P>

40  	At the time of making his affidavit Mr Williams had a time
sheet, showing that on 14 November 1990 he had conferred at his
office with
Craig Kelly, Mrs Kelly and Mr Sullivan for fifty-five minutes.  Mr Williams had
no file note of the conference and had
no recollection of the conference.
<P>

41  	In his affidavit Mr Williams noted that on 14 November 1990 a
number of documents were executed, including:-
<P>

42  	(i) The mortgage, that is the mortgage by Mr Sullivan to the
Bank of the land in Queensland.
<P>

43  	(ii) A document described as an equitable mortgage from Craig
Kelly to the Bank.
<P>

44  	(iii) A notice to mortgagor regarding execution of documents,
which was signed by Mr Sullivan.
<P>

45  	(iv) A notice to mortgagor regarding execution of documents,
which was signed by Craig Kelly.
<P>

46  	(v) An acknowledgment and consent of third party guarantor,
which was signed by Mr Sullivan.
<P>

47  	(vi) A notice which was in similar terms to document (iii),
except that it also included a certificate of witness signed by
Mr Williams,
concerning the mortgage from Mr Sullivan to the Bank.
<P>

48  	(vii) A notice similar to document (vi), except that it
concerned an equitable mortgage from Nobsa.
<P>

49  	In a further affidavit of 10 February 1999 Mr Williams gave
evidence about what his usual practices were in November 1990.
 Paragraph 2 of
this affidavit was in the following terms:-
<P>

"It would be my usual practice prior to asking someone to sign a guarantee to
say words to the effect of:-
<P>

(a) (i)	`The guarantee is limited or limited to the amount of ($    ) plus
costs and interest for a period of (.   ) months' or
<P>

     (ii)	The guarantee is for an unlimited amount".
<P>

(b)	You should realise that it is as if you are borrowing the money yourself
and you are liable as much as the borrower.
<P>

(c)	You could be liable even if the borrower is able to set aside the debt due
by the borrower to the lender for any reason.
<P>

(d)	(If the guarantee is unlimited), the guarantee secures future advances and
you should remain aware of the circumstances giving
rise to the advance and
likely events in the future affecting the advance.
<P>

(e)	You will be liable to the extent of the full amount owed to the bank (if
the guarantee is unlimited) even if all securities
are realised and there is a
shortfall.
<P>

(f)	You accept the bank's calculations as the amount owing.
<P>

(g)	This is a primary security and can be called upon before the borrower or
the securities offered by the borrower.
<P>

(h)	Do you understand what you are signing?
<P>

(i)	Are you signing voluntarily?
<P>

(j)	Do you have any questions?"
<P>

50  	Paragraph 3 of this affidavit was in the following terms:-
<P>

"3.	It was my usual practice prior to asking someone to sign a third party
mortgage at my office to say words to the effect of:-
<P>

(a)	`The consequences of default are that the guarantee may be called upon;
the securities will be realised including the security
for the guarantee;  real
property security could be tenanted and sold later;  you will be required to
vacate the property so it can
be sold;  money could be spent on the property to
make it saleable.
<P>

(b)	If the security was realised and there was a shortfall then you remain
liable for that shortfall.
<P>

(c)	Generally, if the terms and conditions of the loan are complied with, then
your commitment would not be called upon.
<P>

(d)	This is a (ranking) mortgage and the mortgagor has the obligation to comply
with the terms of the mortgage which include payment
of rates and taxes,
keeping the security habitable, not further encumbering the property, repayment
of the loan if the property is
to be sold, no additions to the improvements on
the property without approval of the lender, `all monies' mortgage (if
applicable).
<P>

(e)	I would always either have the guarantor read the certificate of
understanding or I would read out the clauses contained in
the certificate of
understanding.
<P>

(f)	At the very least I would read out the essence of those clauses in the
certificate of understanding.
<P>

(g)	If possible I would always have the guarantor sign the certificate of
understanding as confirmation of having understood the
clauses in that
certificate'".
<P>

51  	It is convenient at this stage to refer in more detail to some
of the documents which were signed in Mr Williams' office on
14 November 1990
and to some of the steps leading up to the signing of the documents.
<P>

52  	By a letter of 2 October 1990 signed by Mr Thurecht, the manager
of the Sutherland Branch of the Bank, the Bank advised Craig
Kelly that
approval had been given by the Bank to the substitution of a mortgage over the
land at 23 Foxhill Court, Carrara, Queensland
for the existing mortgage over
the land at Kirrawee.  In this letter the Bank said "also an equitable mortgage
and floating charge
will be taken over Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited's assets and
undertaking".  The Bank said that it would be instructing its solicitors
Watkins Tapsell and Nolan to prepare the new documentation.
<P>

53  	On 18 October 1990 Mr Williams wrote a letter to Watkins Tapsell
and Nolan.  In this letter he referred to telephone discussions
earlier that
day and said "we...confirm that we act on behalf of Messrs Kelly and Sullivan
as well as Nobsa Holdings, in relation
to the above matters (which were stated
to be - Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited, Kelly purchase from Ahmet, Ahmet discharge
of mortgage
to State Bank, Sullivan mortgage to State Bank 23 Foxhill Court,
Surfers Paradise).  In this letter Mr Williams said "We would appreciate
your
assistance in treating the above matters as urgent".
<P>

54  	On 26 October 1990 Watkins Tapsell and Nolan wrote to Mr
Williams, enclosing a number of documents for execution.   The documents
forwarded for execution included a document described in the letter as an
equitable mortgage.  However, quite inexplicably, this
document was not an
equitable mortgage to be given by Nobsa over its assets and undertaking but an
equitable mortgage from the individual
Craig Kelly.  Furthermore, according to
its terms, it was to operate (when executed) as a fixed charge over certain
securities and
it did not purport to create any kind of floating charge.  
<P>

55  	On 30 and 31 October 1990 Gray and Perkins communicated by
telephone and letter with a firm of Queensland solicitors, asking
them to act
as agents in obtaining information about the land and identifying their client
as Mr Sullivan.
<P>

56  	The mortgage executed by Mr Sullivan on 14 November 1990 stated
that the mortgagor covenanted with the mortgagee in the terms
of the schedule
to the mortgage and memorandum No J939223F filed in the office of the
Queensland Registrar of Titles ("the memorandum").
<P>

57  	In the schedule to the mortgage the mortgagor Mr Sullivan
acknowledged that for the purposes of the memorandum the "customer"
was Nobsa.
The schedule also provided "this mortgage is collateral to equitable mortgage
of even date from Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited".
 
<P>

58  	The memorandum is a very lengthy document, to some of the
provisions of which it will be necessary to refer later in this judgment.
 I
can say at this stage that I am satisfied that there was no copy of the
memorandum at the conference at Mr Williams' office on
14 November 1990.
<P>

59  	The notice to customer/mortgagor/guarantor regarding execution
of documents signed by Mr Sullivan was in the following terms:-
<P>

"PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE SIGNING THE DOCUMENT(S) ATTACHED TO
<P>

The Bank strongly recommends that you take the attached document(s) to a
Solicitor and request that its/their nature and effect
be explained to you.
<P>

The Bank seeks to be fair and reasonable in its dealing with you and would like
to be assured that:-
<P>

(a)	you have signed the document(s) voluntarily;
<P>

(b)	you understand it/their nature and effect; and
<P>

(c)	you have:-
<P>

(i) compared your obligations and responsibilities to the Bank with those of
any other person named in the document(s); and
<P>

(ii) considered the consequences to you should there be any default in those
obligations and responsibilities.
<P>

Accordingly, the attached document(s) must be signed before an officer of the
Bank or a Solicitor.  That person must complete the
certificate enclosed with
the documents."
<P>

60  	An acknowledgment and consent of third party guarantor signed by
Mr Sullivan contained a consent by Mr Sullivan to the Bank
releasing the
security it held over the land at Kirrawee.  It also contained a declaration by
Mr Sullivan "that I am not relying
on any statement or representation made by
either the Bank and/or the other party to the transaction".
<P>

The certificate of witness by Mr Williams stated, with respect to the mortgage
from Mr Sullivan, that Mr Williams certified:-
<P>

(a) The document was signed and dated before me
<P>

(b) I identified the parties before the document was signed
<P>

(c) I asked the parties whether the document was being signed voluntarily and
the answer was "yes"
<P>

(d) I asked the parties whether he understood the nature and effect of the
document and the answer was "yes"
<P>

(e) I asked the parties whether he has:-
<P>

(i) Compared his obligations and responsibilities to the Bank with those of any
other person named in the document; and
<P>

(ii) Considered the consequences to him should there be any default in those
obligations and responsibilities; and the answer was
"yes".
<P>

61  	Signed documents were forwarded by Mr Williams to Watkins,
Tapsell &amp; Nolan on 14 November 1990.
<P>

62  	Affidavits by Marjory Craig (Mrs Kelly) and Craig Kelly were
also filed on behalf of Mr Williams.
<P>

63  	In his affidavit Craig Kelly said that when the Bank told Craig
Kelly and Mr Ahmet that additional (or substituted) security
would have to be
put up, before the Bank would release the security given by Mr Ahmet, he asked
his mother whether she would give
security over the half share Craig Kelly
thought she owned in the land in Queensland.  He was told by his mother that
she had transferred
her half interest in the land to Mr Sullivan.  Mr Sullivan
was then approached and asked if he would provide a security over the
land.
<P>

64  	Craig Kelly recalled the meeting at Mr Williams' office on 14
November 1990 as lasting "for quite a period of time 2-2&#189;
hours".  He said
that at the meeting Mr Williams "went through and explained each and every
document to Sullivan".  This evidence
was admitted on the basis that it was
evidence that Mr Williams had offered some explanation, but not necessarily an
adequate explanation,
of every document.  Craig Kelly said that Mr Williams
said to Mr Sullivan words to the effect, "you realise that by signing this
you
could lose your house" and that Mr Sullivan replied that he did understand
that.
<P>

65  	In an affidavit in reply Mr Sullivan said that he had no
recollection of any such words having been said at the meeting with
Mr
Williams.  He said that he recalled the meeting as lasting only between 20 and
30 minutes.
<P>

66  	In her affidavit Marjory Craig said that she and Mr Sullivan had
lived together between 1975 and 1991.  She said that during
their relationship
Mr Sullivan in partnership with a builder had built and sold eleven home units
and two houses, obtaining finance
from the Bank and engaging a firm of
solicitors and an accountant.  
<P>

67  	Marjory Craig said that she, her son Craig and Mr Sullivan had a
number of discussions about "whether Sullivan would be prepared
to put up his
house at Carrara in place of Ahmet's house" and that "Sullivan in these
discussions expressed reluctance to put up
his house as security but eventually
agreed to do so".
<P>

68  	Marjory Craig said in her affidavit that "in about October or
November 1990 Sullivan, Craig and I attended a meeting with the
then manager of
the Bank at Sutherland.  The purpose of the meeting was to see whether or not
the Bank would accept Sullivan's property
at Carrara as security for the
company's indebtedness to the Bank in lieu of Ahmet's house".  At the meeting
the bank manager asked
Mr Sullivan how much the land at Carrara was worth.  The
bank manager "told Sullivan the amount of the indebtedness then owed by
the
company to the Bank, although I cannot recall the figure that he mentioned" and
that Mr Sullivan said "I hope this is going to
be OK.  I don't want to lose my
house".
<P>

69  	In her affidavit Marjory Craig gave evidence about the meeting
at Mr Williams' office on 14 November 1990.  She said that the
meeting lasted
for about an hour.  Much of the meeting was spent in Mr Williams explaining the
effect of the documents.  The conversation
between Mr Williams and Mr Sullivan
included the following:-
<P>

"Williams: 	If the company can't pay back its debt to the Bank, you will be
liable and they will be able to take your property.
 Do you understand that
your property is at stake?
<P>

Sullivan:	Yes I do, I understand.
<P>

Williams:	Do you want to get other legal advice?
<P>

Sullivan:	No.  They are a pair of mighty workers, so I am trusting them.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

Williams:	Do you understand the nature and effect of these document?
<P>

Sullivan:	Yes.
<P>

Williams:	Do you understand the consequences if the company defaults?
<P>

Sullivan:	Yes.
<P>

Williams:	Have you got any questions or do you need anything else to be
explained?
<P>

Sullivan:	No."
<P>

70  	Marjory Craig said in her affidavit that on the evening of 14
November 1990 she and Mr Sullivan had an argument.  In the course
of the
argument Mr Sullivan said, "I shouldn't have signed the mortgage... I could
lose my house.  My life's savings are in that
place.  You've got me into
this".
<P>

71  	Marjory Craig said that after she and Mr Sullivan had separated
she had a conversation with Mr Sullivan in the following terms:-
<P>

"Sullivan:	I thought I was only signing for six months.
<P>

I:	That's not true.  That's a lie.  It was for as long as we were in the
business 
<P>

Sullivan:	I should never have signed.
<P>

I:	Well why did you?
<P>

Sullivan:	I signed because I didn't want to lose you".
<P>

72  	In an affidavit in reply Mr Sullivan said that he and Marjory
Craig had lived together from 1979 to 1990.  He agreed that he
had been
involved in the development of approximately eleven villas but said that he had
had only a "minimal" involvement on the
financial side.  Financed for the
projects had been arranged through a Mr Back, the manager of the Bank's Oxford
Street Branch. 
Mr Sullivan had no recollection of the words which Marjory
Craig alleged had been spoken at the meeting at the Bank.  In particular,
he
denied that he had been told the amount of Nobsa's indebtedness to the Bank.
Mr Sullivan denied that the meeting in Mr Williams'
office it had been
explained to him that his house was at stake, that he was asked whether he
would like to get other legal advice
or that he was asked whether he understood
the consequences of Nobsa defaulting.  He denied the alleged argument on the
evening of
14 November 1990 and the alleged conversation after he and Marjory
Craig had separated.
<P>

73  	I will now refer to some of the oral evidence which was given at
the hearing.  I have taken into account all of the oral evidence
(as I have,
all of the affidavit and documentary evidence), whether or not I refer to it
expressly in this judgment.
<P>

74  	Mr Joiner gave oral evidence that in 1990 the Bank's practice
was that it would not accept a mortgage, unless it received a
certificate from
the person who had witnessed the execution of the mortgage by the mortgagor.

<P>

75  	In oral evidence in chief Mr Lyons confirmed that he had signed
the application for advance/review on 14 September 1990.  The
information in
the application about the financial position of Nobsa had been taken from draft
accounts for the year ended 30 June
1990 prepared by Mr Weidenhofer.  The
person by whom Mr Sullivan had been "fully appraised" of the situation if
default should occur
was Mr Lyons himself.  
<P>

76  	That Nobsa had an actual debit balance greater than its
overdraft limit indicated that Nobsa had cash flow difficulties.  Mr
Lyons was
asked whether in such circumstances he had a practice, when speaking to third
parties proposing to give a mortgage to secure
the indebtedness of the
customer.  He said "my practice would have been, where its a third party
involved, after getting the permission
of the principals, I would have pointed
out the fact that the account was currently over its limit".  He was asked
whether he would
have provided further information to the proposed third party
mortgagor and he replied "I would get permission from the principal
and I would
answer whatever questions were asked of (by) the third person".
<P>

77  	In cross-examination Mr Lyons said that he had deduced from the
words in the application "DC Kelly who has been fully appraised
of situation if
default should occur" that he had had a meeting with Mr Sullivan, in which he
himself had appraised Mr Sullivan of
the situation if default should occur.  He
would have made notes of the meeting but those notes had not been kept.  Mr
Lyons said
that he did have an actual recollection of the meeting "because it
was an unusual matter with a third party mortgagor".  He had no
direct
recollection of how many people were at the meeting.  The words in the
application about Mr Sullivan having been appraised
summed up what he had told
Mr Sullivan at the meeting.  He told Mr Sullivan that if there was default the
Bank might be forced to
sell Mr Sullivan's property.
<P>

78  	Mr Lyons had no recollection of telling Mr Sullivan at the
meeting that Nobsa's overdrawn account was over its limit and nowhere
in the
application was it stated that Mr Sullivan had been so informed.  Mr Lyons
confirmed that it was his practice in 1990 to inform
a proposed third party
mortgagor that the customer's account was over its limit, only after obtaining
permission from the customer.
 There was no note in the Bank's files that he
had obtained Nobsa's permission or that he had told Mr Sullivan that Nobsa's
account
was over its limit.
<P>

79  	Mr Lyons was cross-examined about the draft accounts for Nobsa
prepared by Mr Weidenhofer, on which Mr Lyons had based the
statement of the
financial position of Nobsa in the application for advance/review, the
statement of the financial position of Nobsa
in the application for
advance/review and the final accounts for Nobsa prepared by Mr Weidenhofer,
which was forwarded Mr Ahmet's
solicitors and Mr Williams with a letter of 17
October 1990.  Mr Lyons did not have these final accounts, when he prepared the
application
of 14 September 1990.  The draft accounts showed a positive figure
for total shareholders equity but a deficiency in working capital
of more than
$100,000.  However, in preparing the statement of financial position in the
application, Mr Lyons eliminated as an asset
"loans to directors or
persons/entities associated with directors $290,350", eliminated as an asset
"intangibles $42,500" and eliminated
as a liability "loans from directors or
persons/entities associated with directors $21,708".  In the statement of
financial position
in the application the deficiency in the working capital of
Nobsa was more than $300,000 and the deficiency in shareholders' funds
was more
than $150,000.  The final accounts prepared by Mr Weidenhofer showed a worse
position than the draft accounts, with a deficiency
of more than $200,000 in
working capital and a small deficiency in shareholders' funds.   In these final
accounts Mr Weidenhofer
did not make the adjustments which Mr Lyons had
made.
<P>

80  	Mr Lyons confirmed that, at the time he prepared the
application, the mortgage over Craig Kelly's house secured Craig Kelly's
indebtedness to the Bank then amounting to about $310,000 and Nobsa's
indebtedness to the Bank amounting to about $400,000.  Accordingly,
if Craig
Kelly's house was sold and the gross proceeds of sale were, as projected,
$490,000, then Craig Kelly's indebtedness could
be repaid in full but only
about $150,000 of Nobsa's indebtedness could be repaid.
<P>

81  	Mr Lyons could not recall whether at the meeting he had asked Mr
Sullivan whether he was living in the house at Carrara but
said that it was his
practice to ascertain if a property being offered as a security by a third
party mortgagor was that person's
home.
<P>

82  	Mr Lyons was cross-examined about a letter from Mr Weidenhofer's
firm to the Bank dated 5 September 1990, which stated that
a cash flow analysis
for Nobsa was enclosed.  The letter itself had been discovered by the Bank but
the enclosed cash flow analysis
had not.  I am satisfied that a document shown
to Mr Lyons in cross-examination was a copy of the cash flow analysis enclosed
with
the letter of 5 September 1990.  This document showed a projected cash
injection of $150,000 in November 1990.  
<P>

83  	Mr Lyons was cross-examined about the proposed sale of Craig
Kelly's house.  At the auction held on 13 October 1990 Craig Kelly's
house was
passed in.  By this time Mr Lyons was no longer employed by the Bank.  If he
had still been employed by the Bank, it would
have been a matter of very
considerable concern to him that Craig Kelly's house had not been sold.
<P>

84  	Mr Lyons was cross-examined about a branch watch list and
classified account report relating to the Cascades Restaurant prepared
on 28
June 1990 by an officer of the Bank, Mr Kevin Ray.  On p2 of this report Mr Ray
wrote "we are now over loanability", that is
the amount the Bank had advanced
was greater than the amount the Bank should have been lending on the basis of
its own guidelines.
 Mr Ray wrote "business is not performing and servicing
capacity quite evidently non-existent.  Kelly's accounts are not being serviced
and $50,000 time loan naturally cannot be repaid.... We should keep debt
aligned to real estate security" (that is the Bank should
at least keep the
debt from exceeding the value of the real estate over which it had a
security).
<P>

85  	Mr Lyons was asked about the increase in the indebtedness of
Nobsa between the time of Mr Ray's report and the time of Mr Lyons
preparing
his application.  He said, "it would have been with the knowledge of regional
office, as all accounts are scrutinised weekly".
 He did not regard the
increase in indebtedness as a serious matter, because the payment of cheques
having the effect of increasing
the indebtedness of Nobsa would have been
approved by the Bank's regional office.  In his report Mr Ray recommended:-
<P>

l.	"No increase in exposure".
<P>

2.	"Notice customers of defaults for all accounts and call for financials and
review of all accounts for resolve by 31/8/90".
<P>

3.	"Obtain third party consents". (that is third party mortgagors should give
express consent to the Bank's increased exposure)".
<P>

3.(sic)	"Any decisions to 2 to be based on either (A) evidence of and
satisfactory arrangements servicing of repayment (with no
increase in debt).
(B) repayment from sale security (with no increase in debt) or by
re-finance".
<P>

4.	"If above unsatisfactory, recovery action to be commenced".
<P>

86  	By the time Mr Lyons prepared his application the course of
action which he considered should be adopted was the sale of security,
that is
the sale of Craig Kelly's property.  At the time of preparing the application
Mr Lyons was sure that Craig Kelly's property
would be sold and he did not turn
his mind to the contingency of the property not being sold at the auction to be
held on 13 October
1990.
<P>

87  	On 1 August 1990 the manager of the Sutherland Branch of the
Bank sent a proposal to the regional lending manager from the
accountant (I
infer Mr Weidenhofer) concerning the Cascades Restaurant, Craig Kelly and C
Ahmet that the Bank provide accommodation
totalling $2.5m, to enable the
purchase of the Goochy's Restaurant and reception lounge and the re-financing
of the existing debts
of the Cascades Restaurant.  The Cascades Restaurant "was
to be sold about Christmas.  It has been on the market already, without
any
offers".  This proposal was not recommended by the manager and was ultimately
not proceeded with.  The manager stated in the
memorandum:-
<P>

"My faith in the accountant was reduced when on the first meeting he stated
that if both restaurants continue till Cascades was
sold this would not be a
problem because `Cascades can meet its own financial re-payments on its own'.
I pointed out that this didn't
appear so when since the account was obtained
from CTB in 1988... the debt has continually increased... ".
<P>

88  	In a memorandum the manager also noted:-
<P>

"Kelly stated also off the record that following a recent tax audit it appears
they may be liable for $50,000 back tax".
<P>

89  	On p1 of the memorandum the following words and figures
appeared:-
<P>

"ODL		$263,000		ODL1		$190,000 (updated valuation of security allowed for, debt
to be carried to $250,000)"
<P>

90  	Mr Lyons explained this part of the memorandum, as meaning that
there had been an updated valuation of Craig Kelly's property
increasing the
value of the property, and even though the formal overdraft limit had not been
increased, approval had been given
by the Bank's regional office to the amount
of Nobsa's indebtedness increasing to $250,000 and that as at 1 August 1990 the
actual
debit balance was $263,000.
<P>

91  	Mr Lyons was shown a report dated 20 September 1990, which had
been signed by Mr Thurecht and not himself, and concluded that
he had ceased
acting as relieving manager at the Sutherland Branch at some time before 20
September 1990.
<P>

92  	On 19 October 1990 the manager of the Sutherland Branch sent a
memorandum to the regional manager, referring to an application
by Craig Kelly
for leasing finance.  The balance of Nobsa's overdraft account was stated to be
$261,193.  The manager recommended
that the application for leasing finance be
refused.  The manager noted in the memorandum:-
<P>

"Mr Kelly's home did not sell at auction.  Asking price $550,000.  Bids reached
$440,000.  Agent is negotiating with bidders.  Mr
Kelly does not want to reduce
price".
<P>

93  	On 22 October 1990 the regional lending manager refused the
application for leasing finance, adding:-
<P>

"If debt not reduced to $250,00 by 15/11/90 submit for call-up. (Please advise
clients' accordingly of our intentions)".
<P>

94  	In a memorandum dated 22 November 1990 the manager of the
Sutherland Branch noted that the balance of the overdraft account
had been
reduced to $237,570 "by the deposit of $40,000 on settlement of the change of
directors".  It was noted that negotiations
for the sale of Craig Kelly's house
at a price of $465,000 had fallen through.
<P>

95  	On 22 January 1991 the Bank directed "the proprietors, Cascades
Restaurant" to arrange outside finance or sell Craig Kelly's
property at Gymea,
within two months.
<P>

96  	In re-examination Mr Lyons said that he had no direct
recollection of anyone apart from Mr Sullivan having been present at
the
meeting at the Bank.  He was shown a letter dated 22 August 1990 from Mr
Thurecht to the proprietors of the restaurant, confirming
that the "agreed
limit" of the overdraft account was $250,000 and he was also shown consents by
Mr and Mrs Ahmet and by Craig Kelly
to the granting of a further advance of
$60,000 to Nobsa.
<P>

97  	Mr Sullivan was cross-examined at some length.  Mr Sullivan
agreed that he had over several years in partnership with a builder
carried out
a number of real estate developments, most of which had been financed by the
Bank on the security of mortgages.  However,
he claimed that he was financially
illiterate and could not read a balance sheet.  He said that he was helped by
Mr Back, a personal
friend, who was the manager of the branch of the bank in
the same building Mr Sullivan worked in.  Each time he borrowed money from
the
Bank he had to go to the Bank and sign documents.   The following questions and
answers occurred:-
<P>

"Q.	What did you understand you were signing?
<P>

A.	That I would have to pay the money back.
<P>

Q.	What did you understand the bank might do if you didn't pay the money back
on any of these occasions?
<P>

A.	I was always so confident.  I never thought that much about it, but I
thought at least they would take my land".
<P>

Later the following questions and answers occurred:-
<P>

"Q.	When you went in to sign paper work from time to time, did you understand
that the reason for that was so that the bank could
make sure if anything went
wrong with the development, the bank would have rights against the land?
<P>

A. 	Yes, yes.
<P>

Q.	And one of those rights, and an important right, was that the bank could
take possession of the land and sell it to recoup its
loan?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	And that was a standard aspect of all of these transactions, wasn't it?
<P>

A.	I would say so, yes."
<P>

98  	Mr Sullivan was shown copies of a number of registered mortgages
which he had signed between 1979 and 1985.
<P>

99  	Mr Sullivan said that when he gave the guarantee in 1985 and
when the guarantee was released the following year, it appeared
to him that the
restaurant was doing well.  He said "I had a lot of confidence in Craig Kelly.
He had a lot of experience... very
hard worker".  Mr Sullivan did not regularly
go to the restaurant, until after he retired in 1989 and came down from
Queensland from
time to time to assist in the restaurant.  When he was in the
restaurant, it appeared to him to be doing good business.  
<P>

100  	Mr Sullivan was asked "you understood the effect (of the
guarantee entered into in 1985) was that if Craig was unable or unwilling
to
repay the loan from the State Bank, you could be called upon to do that?" and
he replied "yes".
<P>

101  	The following questions and answers occurred in
cross-examination:-
<P>

"Q.	And some time in late - the latter part of 1990 you were approached by
Craig who said to you that Mr Ahmet wanted to be bought
out of the business?
<P>

A.	That's right.
<P>

Q.	And he said to you - this is Craig said to you, `The only way I can buy
Jimmy Ahmet out is if I allow his house to be released
from security and
replace it with your house at Carrara, do you remember that?
<P>

A.	Yes
<P>

Q.	When Craig said that to you, you understood from that didn't you that when
he said Jimmy wanted his house to be released from
security, that was a
security for the businesses's borrowings?
<P>

A.	That's right.
<P>

Q.	Borrowings from the State Bank, is that right?
<P>

A.	That's right.
<P>

Q.	And he went on to tell you that - this is Craig told you that his own house
would be sold by January or February and after that
he wouldn't need your
security any longer, is that right?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	And you understood that what that would involve would be going to the bank
and providing the bank with a mortgage over your house,
is that right?
<P>

A.	For a period of four months I understood".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"Q.	All right.  He said to you, `It will be like the other one you will be
released after a couple of months' - that is what you
say?
<P>

A.	Yes, as soon as my house is sold".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"Q.	But you understood that until Craig sold his house your house could be on
the line for the debts of the restaurant?
<P>

A.	Yes, but I wasn't worried.
<P>

Q.	Why weren't you worried?
<P>

A.	Because Craig was such a good worker, everybody assured me the business was
going well, I had every confidence in him, he was
a hard worker, a lot of
experience in the industry and the real estate agent Ray White said, `We are
asking 590,000 for the house;
 we must get 500 - this is November, it's going
on the market after Christmas".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

Witness:	The point is this, I found out afterwards that he paid the 400,000 he
got for the house and there was still 250 owing.
 If I knew that I would never
ever have signed it".
<P>

102  	Mr Sullivan said that he had no idea how much the business owed
the Bank but thought it was less than the amount the agent
had mentioned as a
likely sale price for Craig Kelly's house.  He did not ask anyone how much the
business owed the Bank.
<P>

103  	Mr Sullivan understood that, unlike the guarantee given by him
in 1985, there would be limit on his liability under the mortgage
and that the
mortgage would secure all borrowings by the business from the Bank.
<P>

104  	Mr Sullivan said that he spoke to Mr Weidenhofer, who he knew
to be the accountant for the restaurant and in whom he had confidence,
within
two weeks before signing the mortgage.  Mr Sullivan was "a bit nervy".  He
asked Mr Weidenhofer about the proposed mortgage
and Mr Weidenhofer said,
"you've got no problems, no worries.  You're right, Don".  Mr Sullivan had a
second conversation with Mr
Weidenhofer shortly before he signed the mortgage,
in which he said "we are going to sign next week.  Is it all right?" and Mr
Weidenhofer
replied, "yes".  Mr Weidenhofer did not provide any figures to Mr
Sullivan.  Mr Sullivan said to Mr Weidenhofer, "we will be released
when the
house is sold" and Mr Weidenhofer did not express any disagreement.
<P>

105  	When Craig Kelly had first raised the matter of the mortgage,
Mr Sullivan's response had been that he wanted to think about
it.  He was
reluctant to agree straight away, because he knew that he was putting his house
at risk, although "I didn't think there
was any risk".  He had every confidence
in Craig Kelly's competence.  
<P>

106  	Mr Sullivan was cross-examined about the meeting at the Bank.
He agreed that there had been a meeting.  He remembered Mr Thurecht
contacting
him.  He did not remember a meeting with Mr Lyons.  He did not recall Mrs Kelly
having been present at the meeting but
she could have been.  The only thing he
could remember about the meeting at the Bank was that a bank officer took a
photocopy of
a photograph Mr Sullivan had of the house at Carrara, to be used
in identifying the house for making a valuation.   Mr Sullivan understood
that
the Bank wished to be satisfied as to how much Mr Sullivan's property could be
sold for.  The bank officer made it clear to
Mr Sullivan that his property
could be sold up by the Bank, if the restaurant could not pay its debits.  Mr
Sullivan denied that
the bank officer said that the restaurant was having cash
flow difficulties or told him how much the restaurant owed the Bank. "If
I
would have known how much they owed, I wouldn't have signed".  His only
understanding was that the restaurant's debt was less than
the anticipated sale
price of Craig Kelly's house.
<P>

107  	Mr Sullivan was cross-examined about the meeting at Mr
Williams' office.  He knew that he was going to Mr Williams' office
to sign a
mortgage in favour of the Bank.  Mr Sullivan said, "I think I just signed
everything automatically.  I trusted Peter Williams,
he was acting on my behalf
too, I thought".  Mr Sullivan understood that the documents he was being asked
to sign would go back to
the Bank and that the Bank would be relying on his
having signed the documents in releasing Mr Ahmet's mortgage.
<P>

108  	Mr Sullivan said that at one stage of the meeting at Mr
Williams' office he asked, "have I got any protection in this?" and
Mr Williams
said, "It's all in the family".  Mr Williams did not suggest to him that he
obtain any other advice before signing any
of the documents.  Mr Sullivan said
he was "satisfied that there were no risks, as soon as the house was sold at
Gymea Bay I would
get the money back.  I had every confidence with Craig Kelly
and the way the business was running. I was very naive, I appreciate".
 Mrs
Kelly too was "over confident" about the business.  He had been told by both
Craig Kelly and Mrs Kelly that the business would
do better, without any
participation in it by members of the Ahmet family.
<P>

109  	After Craig Kelly's house was ultimately sold, Mr Sullivan was
told by Craig Kelly that there was not enough money from the
sale for Mr
Sullivan's mortgage to be discharged.
<P>

110  	Mr Sullivan was also cross-examined by counsel for Mr Williams.
Mr Sullivan was asked, "do you agree that the amount of risk
that there was for
you in this deal would depend upon the amount of money that Craig Kelly owed
the Bank?" and he replied, "I was
very naive on that point, yes".  Later Mr
Sullivan said, "he (Craig Kelly) owed some money, yes;  I didn't know how
much".
<P>

111  	With regard to his speaking to Mr Weidenhofer, Mr Sullivan said
"I had already practically made up my mind but I just wanted
more assurances.
I think that (what Mr Weidenhofer said) clinched it".
<P>

112  	Mr Sullivan was cross-examined about evidence he had given that
he suggested to Craig Kelly that he, Craig Kelly, should get
some payment from
Mr Ahmet.  It was put to Mr Sullivan that he had thought that Mr Ahmet's share
in the business was not worth anything
but Mr Sullivan said that he had never
thought about it in those terms.  "I thought Mr Ahmet wanted to get out and he
wanted his
house released".  
<P>

113  	With regard to the signing of the mortgage by Mr Sullivan, the
following questions and answers occurred:-
<P>

"Q.	In that regard you knew that you were in fact guaranteeing the debts of
Craig Kelly's business?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	And you knew that you were in fact giving a mortgage over your house at
Carrara as security for those debts?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	And you knew that if the moneys that were secured under that guarantee and
mortgage were not paid back, that the bank would be
entitled to, amongst other
things, take the house and sell it?
<P>

A.	I agree but I imagined it would never happen.
<P>

Q.	That's because you trusted Craig Kelly and what he told you?
<P>

A.	That's right.
<P>

Q.	And the real estate agent and what he told you?
<P>

A.	That's right.
<P>

Q.	And the accountant and what he told you?
<P>

A.	Yes, that's right".
<P>

114  	Mr Sullivan conceded that Mr Williams may have asked him
whether he was signing the documents voluntarily.  
<P>

115  	Mr Sullivan denied that at the meeting Mr Williams had asked
him whether he wanted to get other legal advice or that he had
replied "no,
they are a pair of mighty workers, so I am trusting them".
<P>

116  	The following question and answer occurred:-
<P>

"Q.	The position is this, though, that even if Mr Williams had invited you to
go and take other legal advice on that occasion you
wouldn't have thought it
necessary because you had made up your mind to go ahead, that's correct, isn't
it?
<P>

A	It's very difficult to say at this stage;  I haven't thought much about it.
I thought he was acting on my behalf as well as Craig
Kelly's".
<P>

117  	Mr Sullivan agreed that Mr Dobson had advised against Mr
Sullivan agreeing to the re-financing proposal, on the grounds that
it might
prejudice whatever rights Mr Sullivan had against the Bank.  He did not recall
Mr Dobson mentioning to him the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a>. 
<P>

118  	Mr Williams was cross-examined by counsel for the Bank.  
<P>

119  	Mr Williams said that he had an actual recollection of meeting
Mr Sullivan in November 1990 but he could not remember exactly
what was said at
the meeting.  He said "we discussed the documents that he was to sign, we
discussed the certificate that I was to
sign".
<P>

120  	Mr Williams was "not familiar with the financial business" of
Nobsa.  He could not recall if he had made any inquiries about
how much Nobsa
owed the Bank.
<P>

121  	Mr Williams could not recall whether he had advised Mr Sullivan
to obtain independent financial advice.  So far as he could
recall, he had not
had a practice of suggesting to proposed third party mortgagors that they
obtain independent financial advice.
 He did not recall whether before the
meeting he had had any discussion with Mr Weidenhofer about the financial
circumstances of
Nobsa.
<P>

122  	Mr Williams did not recall whether, before the meeting, he had
been provided with copies of Nobsa's financial statements or
whether he
suggested to Mr Sullivan that he should talk to Mr Weidenhofer or whether he
discussed with Mr Sullivan the proposed sale
of Craig Kelly's house.
<P>

123  	Mr Williams agreed that in the letter he wrote to Watkins,
Tapsell &amp; Nolan he endeavoured to convey to the solicitors
for the Bank
that he was acting as solicitor for Mr Sullivan and that he understood that the
Bank would be relying on his certificate
in going forward with the
transaction.
<P>

124  	Mr Williams did not have any recollection of saying anything to
Mr Sullivan about the contents of the schedule to the mortgage.
 His practice
would have been to explain that the mortgage from the third party mortgagor and
the equitable mortgage were each primary
documents capable of being enforced
separately and that each document secured the total indebtedness to the Bank.
Mr Williams did
not recall if at the meeting he had a copy of the memorandum
referred to in the mortgage.
<P>

125  	Mr Williams was cross-examined about the "equitable mortgage"
from Craig Kelly to the Bank.  To the best of his recollection,
that was the
only document he had on 14 November 1990 which could be described as an
equitable mortgage.  His attention was directed
to the clause in the schedule
to the mortgage to the effect that the mortgage was to be collateral to an
equitable mortgage of the
same date from Nobsa.  Mr Williams said, "I
appreciated that the advance was from the Bank to Nobsa Holdings and the
equitable mortgage
was secured by charge over Nobsa Holdings".
<P>

126  	During the cross-examination counsel for the Bank produced the
certificate of witness signed by Mr Williams relating to an
equitable mortgage
from Nobsa to the Bank.  Counsel for Mr Sullivan made a call on both the other
parties for production of any equitable
mortgage executed in November 1990 by
Nobsa.  No such document was produced, then or subsequently.  
<P>

127  	Mr Williams said that it was possible that he had explained the
equitable mortgage to Mr Sullivan, on the basis of its being
an equitable
mortgage from Nobsa.  He accepted that he could not have explained to Mr
Sullivan the contents of an equitable mortgage
from Nobsa, unless he had had
such an equitable mortgage in front of him.
<P>

128  	It was suggested to Mr Williams that, on the face of the
mortgage and without resort to the memorandum, the impression could
be gained
that Mr Sullivan was giving only a security and was not giving a personal
covenant and that he could not have explained
the memorandum without having had
it in front of him.  However, Mr Williams responded that he would have advised
Mr Sullivan of some
of the contents of the memorandum, without having seen the
memorandum.  Cl 31 of the memorandum, which contained a personal covenant
by
the mortgagor not limited to the value of the security, was "a very common
clause in a memorandum".
<P>

129  	Mr Williams accepted that it was likely that part of the period
of fifty-five minutes, which according to his time sheet he
had spent on 14
November 1990, had been spent in perusing the documents received from Watkins,
Tapsell &amp; Nolan before he saw
Mr Sullivan.  Perusing the documents could
have taken a quarter of an hour to half an hour.  There was no separate entry
in Mr Williams'
time sheets for the perusing of documents.  Preparing the
letter of 14 November dispatching the executed documents to Watkins, Tapsell
&amp; Nolan could have taken ten minutes.  There was no separate entry in the
time sheets for this item of work.  However, when it
was put to Mr Williams
that the period of fifty-five minutes included some time for perusing the
documents and some time for preparing
the letter of 14 November 1990, Mr
Williams did not agree.
<P>

130  	Mr  Williams was asked about the correlation between the
certificate of witness he had signed and his evidence about his usual
practice.
He conceded that it was no part of his ordinary practice to ask a proposed
third party mortgagor a question in accordance
with par(e) of the certificate,
whether the person had compared his obligations and responsibilities to the
Bank with those of any
other person named in the documents.  He said it was
unlikely that he had said to Mr Sullivan words to the effect, "what do you
understand
your obligations are, compared to the obligations of Craig Kelly and
Nobsa?".
<P>

131  	Mr Williams did not recall whether he had advised Mr Sullivan
to take independent legal advice.  It would not have been in
accordance with
his usual practice to give such advice.
<P>

132  	Mr Williams had known Craig Kelly for some years and had done
legal work for Craig Kelly and Nobsa on a number of prior occasions.
 All the
instructions he had received in the present matter came from Craig Kelly and Mr
Weidenhofer.  He had received instructions
from them "that they wanted the
substitution of the security to go through urgently".  If on 14 November 1990
Mr Williams had advised
Mr Sullivan to get independent legal advice, then it
was possible that would have caused a significant delay in the transaction
going
through.  If on 14 November 1990 Mr Williams had advised Mr Sullivan to
get independent financial advice, then it was likely that
that would have
caused a significant delay in the transaction going through.  Any delay in the
transaction going through would not
have been in the interests of his other
clients, Craig Kelly, Marjory Craig and Nobsa.
<P>

133  	Mr Williams said that it was not in accordance with his usual
practice to advise a proposed third party mortgagor to get independent
legal
advice or independent financial advice.  It was not in accordance with his
usual practice to see a proposed third party mortgagor
separately from his
other clients and on this occasion he had not seen Mr Sullivan separately from
his other clients.  
<P>

134  	Mr Williams had said previously in his evidence that as at 14
November 1990 he was not aware of Nobsa's financial situation
and did not
recall whether before the meeting on 14 November 1990 he had been provided with
copies of Nobsa's financial statements.
 However, he accepted that he would
have received a copy of the letter of 17 October 1990 from Mr Weidenhofer to Mr
Ahmet's solicitors,
enclosing the final accounts of Nobsa for the year ended 30
June 1990, which showed a deficiency in shareholders' equity and current
liabilities exceeding current assets and it was likely that he would have
perused these accounts, so that as at 14 November he would
have been aware of
Nobsa's financial situation to the extent to which it was disclosed in these
accounts.
<P>

135  	Mr Williams did not know, as at 14 November 1990, the extent to
which the securities held by the Bank to secure Nobsa's indebtedness
also
secured Craig Kelly's indebtedness to the Bank.
<P>

136  	Mr Williams had received a fax from Ray White Real Estate,
enclosing a notice to Ray White Real Estate from the Australian
Taxation Office
requiring Ray White Real Estate to pay money it held to the Australian Taxation
Office, because Craig Kelly owed
the Commissioner of Taxation more than $18,000
in back tax.  Service of this notice had suggested to Mr Williams that Craig
Kelly
was under financial pressure.  A large balance sheet asset of Nobsa
consisted of loans to directors, including Craig Kelly.
<P>

137  	Mr Williams knew that Mr Sullivan was getting nothing out of
the transaction and that the property was Mr Sullivan's home
and his only
significant asset.  It was not in accordance with Mr Williams' practice to
advise proposed third party mortgagors how
their interests could be better
protected, if they decided to go ahead with the transaction.
<P>

138  	Mr Williams agreed in hindsight that there had been a
likelihood of a conflict of interest between Mr Sullivan's interests
and the
interests of his other clients.  He agreed that in 1990 he had appreciated that
if there was a likelihood of a real conflict
of interest, then he should not
act for both parties.
<P>

139  	In re-examination Mr Williams said that when he spoke to Mr
Sullivan on 14 November 1990 he would have made certain assumptions
about the
contents of the mortgage to the Bank (including the memorandum), including that
the mortgagor would be liable to repay
the Bank if the borrower did not, that
the mortgage was "an all monies mortgage" and that if there was a shortfall on
the realisation
of securities the mortgagor would be liable for the
shortfall.
<P>

140  	Craig Kelly was cross-examined at the hearing.  
<P>

141  	Craig Kelly did not recall any meeting with Mr Lyons and did
not remember Mr Lyons.  He remembered dealing with Mr Thurecht
or the Regional
Manager of the Bank.  He could not recall any meeting at the Bank at which Mr
Sullivan was present.
<P>

142  	Craig Kelly claimed that "everything would have been discussed
for me to bring my parents (that is Mrs Kelly and Mr Sullivan)
into the
business;  the accountancy figures, everything would have been discussed in
detail".  He said that he showed Mr Sullivan
the financial documents for the
business.  Mr Sullivan had met Mr Weidenhofer before "and I introduced him
again to Mr Weidenhofer".
 There were "numerous meetings" between Mr Sullivan
and Mr Weidenhofer and "I was present on some".  Mr Weidenhofer mentioned a
figure
to Mr Sullivan as being the amount of the indebtedness of Nobsa.  
<P>

143  	Craig Kelly said "this discussion over the company and him
coming into the business went over for months... I explained fully
how the
business was operating... I explained how much the debt was and I thought that
we could.. with him coming in... we could
achieve it and bring the company back
into line... he was cautious.  But after everything was explained to him by
myself, by Mr Weidenhofer,
he was contented with it and went ahead with it".
<P>

144  	According to Craig Kelly, the meeting at Mr Williams' office
lasted two hours.  "We (Mr Sullivan and himself) both knew we
could lose our
homes".  Craig Kelly could not recall whether the financial position of the
business had been discussed.  "Mr Williams
is not employed to discuss that".
The only thing that would have been brought up on the financial side would have
been rent.
<P>

145  	Craig Kelly's house was put up for action on three occasions.
The house was sold in about August 1991 for $415,000 or $420,000.
 At the first
auction, which was held before 14 November 1990, the reserve price was not
reached and Craig Kelly rejected the highest
offer.  He discussed with his
"parents" that the house had not been sold at auction.
<P>

146  	When Mr Sullivan declined to re-finance the loan, Craig Kelly
was "annoyed" but "again I thought I could struggle and still
make the business
succeed".  The business was "destroyed".  Craig Kelly said that "I don't hold
anything against Mr Sullivan - it's
past, we have got over it, we have got on
with our lives".  
<P>

147  	After Mr Sullivan and Mrs Kelly separated, Craig Kelly assisted
his mother with respect to a proposed claim by her under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto
Relationships Act</a>.  
<P>

148  	Craig Kelly said that he had told the Bank that the property at
Carrara was Mr Sullivan's home and his only asset.
<P>

149  	Craig Kelly said that Nobsa's "financials" had been shown to Mr
Sullivan by himself and that he had also arranged for someone
else, apparently
Mr Weidenhofer, to do it.  He said that he had given Mr Sullivan copies of the
"financials".  When asked what the
"financials" were, he said they were the
income tax returns of Nobsa for the last two or three years.  Mr Sullivan
"wasn't happy
with them".  Craig Kelly discussed the "financials" with Mr
Sullivan on half a dozen occasions over a couple of months.
<P>

150  	Craig Kelly's attention was directed to paragraph 6 of his
affidavit (which had not been read) where he had said "Sullivan
asked to see
the financial accounts, which I made available to him via my accountant Mr
Weidenhofer".  Craig Kelly had said nothing
in his affidavit about himself
showing financial documents to Mr Sullivan.  In his oral evidence Craig Kelly
said that Mr Sullivan
had got "paper work" from him and that he and Mr
Weidenhofer had explained the "paper work" to Mr Sullivan. "Mr Weidenhofer was
given
full directions to explain everything clearly to Mr Sullivan".  
<P>

151  	Craig Kelly could not recall specifically what was discussed at
the meeting at Mr Williams' office.  Mr Williams was "our
company solicitor"
and had acted on many occasions for Nobsa and for Craig Kelly personally.  All
three of Mr Sullivan, Craig Kelly
and Mrs Kelly were present during the entire
meeting.
<P>

152  	Marjory Craig (Mrs Kelly) was cross-examined at the hearing.
She thought that there had been discussions over four to five
weeks at Craig
Kelly's home, before the meeting at Mr Williams' office.  Craig Kelly had
suggested to Mr Sullivan that he put up
his house as an alternative security to
Mr Ahmet's house. To her knowledge, Mr Sullivan did not ask how much Nobsa owed
the Bank
and there was no discussion about the financial situation of Nobsa.
<P>

153  	The name "Lyons" "rang a bell" with Marjory Craig.  There was
only one meeting at the Bank which Marjory Craig attended. 

<P>

154  	Marjory Craig said "I never got involved with the financial
part of it".  Craig Kelly "kept a lot from me rather than have
me worried".

<P>

155  	Marjory Craig said "Craig tried to sell his house, before he
approached Mr Sullivan to go guarantor".  
<P>

156  	Marjory Craig had gone with Mr Sullivan to an auction of Craig
Kelly's house late in 1990, close to the time of the meeting
at Mr Williams'
office.  
<P>

157  	Marjory Craig denied that her separation from Mr Sullivan had
occurred "as a result of him not being prepared to give a mortgage
over his
home to a new financier".  However, later she said Mr Sullivan "rang me at
Hornsby and told me he was finished with me and
he was signing no papers".  She
maintained that "Mr Sullivan and I were never compatible".  In 1993 she had
wished to make a claim
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto Relationships Act</a> concerning the
property at Carrara but no claim was actually brought.  She denied that she had
been angry with Mr Sullivan ever since
but said "I've been very, very upset
about all the matter".  
<P>

158  	After this summary of some of the evidence, affidavit and oral,
of the principal witnesses, Mr Sullivan, Mr Lyons, Mr Williams,
Craig Kelly and
Marjory Craig, it is appropriate that I make some general assessment of the
credibility of the witnesses.
<P>

159  	I accept that Mr Sullivan was an honest witness.  However, I do
not consider that his recollection of events was always reliable.
 He was
endeavouring to give evidence of events which had happened several years
earlier, without the assistance of any contemporaneous
notes.  I will need to
deal separately with his evidence about a number of matters, including his
personal background, his conversations
with Craig Kelly, his conversations with
Mr Weidenhofer, the meeting at the Bank, Mr Sullivan's understanding of the
transaction
he was entering into and the meeting at Mr Williams' office.
<P>

160  	I accept all of Mr Lyons' evidence, subject to the
qualification that I will have to consider specifically his evidence about
the
meeting he said he had at the Bank with Mr Sullivan.  
<P>

161  	I accept Mr Williams' evidence, including his evidence about
what he said was his usual practice in 1990, subject to the qualification
that
I will have to consider specifically what happened at the meeting at his office
on 14 November 1990.  I note that Mr Williams
qualified his original evidence,
that as at 14 November 1990 he was not aware of Nobsa's financial situation, by
agreeing that he
would have received and that it was likely he would have
perused, a copy of Nobsa's final accounts for the year ended 30 June 1990.
<P>

162  	In cross-examination Craig Kelly showed a marked tendency to
give answers which were not responsive to the questions asked
and to say what
he obviously wanted to say, even if it was unresponsive.  I consider that his
answers were often dogmatic, categorical
and exaggerated.  I also consider that
in 1990 he was unduly optimistic about the position and prospects of the
restaurant business
and the price at which, and the ease with which, his house
could be sold and that this excessive optimism would have coloured what
he said
to Mr Sullivan about the business and about the sale of his house.  
<P>

163  	I am also satisfied that, notwithstanding his disclaimer in his
evidence, Craig Kelly blamed, and has continued to blame,
Mr Sullivan for
"destroying" his business (by Mr Sullivan not agreeing to the re-financing
proposal).  He also took his mother's
side in her dispute with Mr Sullivan.  I
am satisfied that these factors coloured the evidence he gave and adversely
affected its
reliability.
<P>

164  	I also consider that Marjory Craig had a sense of grievance
against Mr Sullivan, for having parted with her interest in the
land to Mr
Sullivan and for being unable to reclaim this interest after her relationship
with Mr Sullivan had ended and that this
sense of grievance coloured her
evidence and affected its reliability.
<P>

165  	Where there is a conflict between the evidence of Mr Sullivan
on the one hand and the evidence of Craig Kelly or Marjory Craig
on the other
and there is no evidence corroborating the evidence of Craig Kelly or Marjory
Craig, I would prefer the evidence of
Mr Sullivan.  In particular, I do not
accept Craig Kelly's evidence that "everything would have been discussed" with
Mr Sullivan,
that Craig Kelly showed financial documents to Mr Sullivan, that
there were numerous meetings with Mr Weidenhofer or that Craig Kelly
told Mr
Sullivan the amount of Nobsa's indebtedness to the Bank.
<P>

166  	I will now make some findings about the matters which in
assessing Mr Sullivan's evidence, I said I would have to deal with
separately.
<P>

<b>Mr Sullivan's personal background </b>
<P>

167  	I have already summarised Mr Sullivan's evidence and Marjory
Craig's evidence on this subject.  At the time Mr Sullivan entered
into the
mortgage he was sixty-seven years old and retired.  However, when he gave
evidence before me more than eight years later,
there was no indication that
his faculties were impaired (apart, possibly, from a slight deafness) and I am
satisfied that at the
time he entered into the mortgage Mr Sullivan was not
suffering from any disability by reason of his age.
<P>

168  	Mr Sullivan had little formal education but he worked for many
years as an organiser for the Australian Labor Party and in
the Department of
Industrial Relations and he is clearly a person of at least average mental
acumen and shrewdness.
<P>

169  	In the course of his business as a real estate developer, Mr
Sullivan entered into a number of mortgages with the Bank, standard
features of
which were, as he knew, a personal covenant to repay the money borrowed and a
right in the Bank, in the event of default,
to take possession of the land
mortgaged and to sell it.  
<P>

<b>Mr Sullivan's conversations with Craig Kelly</b>
<P>

170  	It was common ground that Craig Kelly suggested to Mr Sullivan
that he should give a mortgage over the land in Queensland
to take the place of
the mortgage over Mr Ahmet's property.  It is probable that Mr Sullivan did not
agree to give a mortgage the
first time the subject was raised and that there
were a number of conversations on the subject and that the first conversation
between
Craig Kelly and Mr Sullivan occurred earlier than Mr Sullivan said it
did.  It is unlikely that some of the Bank documents, for example
the
application of 14 September 1990, would have been brought into existence,
unless Mr Sullivan had by the time the documents were
brought into existence
indicated his willingness to enter into the proposed transaction.  It is
unlikely that Mr Williams would have
received the instructions he did on 31
August 1990, unless by then Mr  Sullivan had indicated his willingness to enter
into the proposed
transaction.
<P>

171  	I accept that Craig Kelly said to Mr Sullivan words to the
effect that the mortgage over Mr Sullivan's land would be required
for only a
short time, until Craig Kelly's house at Gymea had been sold.  
<P>

172  	As already stated, I do not accept Craig Kelly's evidence that
he told Mr Sullivan the amount of Nobsa's indebtedness to the
Bank.  Nor do I
accept Craig Kelly's oral evidence that he showed financial documents of the
business to Mr Sullivan or discussed
these financial documents with Mr
Sullivan, especially when he had not made such assertions in his affidavit.
Even if Craig Kelly
did show "financials", being income tax returns of Nobsa
for the last two or three years, it is unlikely that these income tax returns
would have revealed the true current position of Nobsa.  To the extent to which
Craig Kelly did speak to Mr Sullivan about the restaurant's
financial position,
it is likely that what he said was excessively optimistic.
<P>

<b>Mr Sullivan's conversations with Mr Weidenhofer </b>
<P>

173  	I have already summarised Mr Sullivan's evidence on this
subject.  Mr Weidenhofer did not give evidence.  I do not consider
that I
should give myself a <b>Jones v Dunkel</b> direction against either the Bank or
Mr Williams, on the basis that neither of them called Mr Weidenhofer, but the
fact remains that
there is no evidence from Mr Weidenhofer.  
<P>

174  	I accept Mr Sullivan's evidence that he spoke to Mr Weidenhofer
a couple of times before he signed the mortgage, on occasions
when Mr
Weidenhofer happened to be at the restaurant and that Mr Weidenhofer reassured
him that there would be no problems or worries
for Mr Sullivan, if he entered
into the mortgage.  That Mr Weidenhofer gave such reassuring answers to Mr
Sullivan, would be consistent
with Mr Weidenhofer having on or about 1 August
1990 put the ambitious proposal to the Bank that the business should acquire
another
restaurant at a cost of $2m and his assertion to the Bank's Branch
Manager, not accepted by the Manager and contradicted by Nobsa's
actual past
performance, that "Cascades can meet its own financial repayments on its
own".
<P>

175  	I do not accept that Mr Weidenhofer made financial documents of
Nobsa available to Mr Sullivan.
<P>

<b>Meeting at the Bank</b>
<P>

176  	It was not disputed by Mr Sullivan that there had been a
meeting at the Bank's Sutherland Branch, at some time before he signed
the
mortgage.  However, there were issues about when the meeting had taken place,
who had been present at the meeting on behalf of
the Bank, who else had been
present and what had been said at the meeting.
<P>

177  	Mr Lyons said that he had been present at a meeting with Mr
Sullivan and that the meeting had taken place a day or two before
the date of
the application of 14 September 1990 which he had himself prepared.  In giving
this evidence, Mr Lyons relied heavily
on inferences he drew from the inclusion
in the application he had prepared of the words "Ahmet's security property
would be released
and replaced by an unencumbered property at Carrara (Gold
Coast) QLD owned by Kelly's stepfather, DC Kelly who has been fully appraised
of situation if default should occur".
<P>

178  	Mr Sullivan did not remember Mr Lyons being at the meeting,
thought that the meeting had been within two weeks of his signing
the mortgage
and generally had little recollection of the meeting, apart from the bank
officer making a copy of the photograph of
the house at Carrara.
<P>

179  	Marjory Craig said that the meeting had been in October or
November 1990, that the meeting had been with the then manager
of the
Sutherland Branch of the Bank (who would not have been Mr Lyons) and that she,
Craig Kelly and Mr Sullivan had attended the
meeting.
<P>

180  	Craig Kelly did not remember any meeting at the Bank, at which
he and Mr Sullivan had been present.
<P>

181  	I consider that I should accept Mr Lyons' evidence about the
meeting.  There is no doubt that the application was prepared
and signed by Mr
Lyons and dated 14 September 1990 and that it contains an assertion that Mr
Sullivan had been fully appraised of
the situation, if default should occur.
It is unlikely that the application would have been prepared and dispatched by
the Branch
of the Bank or that such an assertion would have appeared in the
application, unless a bank officer had spoken to Mr Sullivan about
the proposed
mortgage and "appraised" him of the situation.
<P>

182  	It is not unusual for witnesses such as Mr Sullivan and Marjory
Craig, endeavouring without notes to recall a series of events
occurring
several years before, to telescope the period of time during which these events
occurred.
<P>

183  	I accordingly accept that the meeting took place a short time
before 14 September 1990 and that Mr Lyons attended on behalf
of the Bank.  If
Mr Sullivan was present, then it is highly probable that both Craig Kelly and
Marjory Craig were also present. 
 I also accept, as was conceded by Mr
Sullivan, that at the meeting he was told that his property could be sold by
the Bank, if the
restaurant could not pay its debts.
<P>

184  	Marjory Craig said in her affidavit that at the meeting the
bank officer told Mr Sullivan the amount of Nobsa's indebtedness.
 Mr Sullivan
denied this.  Mr Lyons said he would have provided such information, only if he
had obtained the permission of his principal
(Nobsa).  It emerged in
cross-examination of Marjory Craig that she had little recollection of the
meeting.  I find that Mr Sullivan
was not told the amount of Nobsa's
indebtedness.
<P>

<b>Mr Sullivan's state of knowledge immediately prior to going to Mr Williams'
office on 14 November 1990.</b>
<P>

185  	Mr Sullivan knew that he was going to sign a mortgage to the
Bank of the land at Carrara and that he was guaranteeing the
indebtedness of
Nobsa to the Bank, that the money which Nobsa owed to the Bank would have to be
paid to the Bank, that, unlike the
guarantee he had entered into in 1985, there
was no limit on his liability and that if there was default the Bank would have
rights
against the land.
<P>

186  	However, Mr Sullivan believed that the mortgage would only be
in force for a short time and that the mortgage would be "released",
when Craig
Kelly's house was sold in a couple of months or a few months time.
<P>

187  	Mr Sullivan knew that Nobsa owed money to the Bank but he did
not know how much and he did not know that Nobsa was in serious
financial
difficulties.  Mr Sullivan knew that Craig Kelly owed money to the Bank but he
did not know how much.  If Mr Sullivan had
known that, even if Craig Kelly's
house was sold, the proceeds of sale, after first being applied to satisfy
Craig Kelly's indebtedness
to the Bank, would not have been nearly sufficient
to meet Nobsa's indebtedness to the Bank, with the consequence that the
mortgage
from him would remain in force notwithstanding the sale of Craig
Kelly's house, then Mr Sullivan would not have entered into the
mortgage.  Mr
Sullivan had no knowledge of any intended security from Nobsa by way of an
equitable mortgage
<P>

<b>Meeting at Mr Williams' office</b>
<P>

188  	There is no doubt that a meeting took place at Mr Williams'
office on 14 November, at which the mortgage and various other
documents were
signed.  Mr Sullivan, Craig Kelly and Marjory Craig all in effect claimed to
have a fairly good recollection of the
meeting.  Mr Williams said in his
affidavit that he had no actual recollection of the meeting and that he had no
file note and that
he had only a time sheet, indicating that he had conferred
with Craig Kelly, Mrs Kelly and Mr Sullivan for fifty-five minutes.  In
his
oral evidence he said that he did have some actual recollection of the meeting
but could not recall exactly what was said.
<P>

189  	There was a dispute about how long the meeting had lasted.  Mr
Williams' time sheet showed fifty-five minutes but as there
was no separate
recording of time spent in perusing the documents received from the Bank's
solicitors or in preparing the letter
dispatched with the executed documents,
it is possible that some of the fifty-five minutes were devoted to these
purposes.  Mr Sullivan
said that the meeting lasted twenty to thirty minutes.
Marjory Craig said that the meeting lasted about an hour.  Craig Kelly said
that the meeting lasted two hours.  I consider that this evidence, like much of
his evidence, was exaggerated.  I consider that Mr
Sullivan's evidence is
likely to be an underestimate and that the meeting, as distinct from any time
spent by Mr Williams on other
tasks such as perusing the documents, lasted
somewhere between half an hour and fifty-five minutes.
<P>

190  	All of Craig Kelly, Marjory Craig and Mr Sullivan were present
throughout the meeting and Mr Williams did not give any advice
to Mr Sullivan
that he should see Mr Sullivan separately.  Mr Williams knew that Mr Sullivan
was getting nothing personally out of
the transaction and that the land was Mr
Sullivan's home and his only significant asset.
<P>

191  	I accept Mr Williams' evidence about what he said was his usual
practice when asking someone to sign a guarantee or a third
party mortgage.
<P>

192  	I also consider it probable that Mr Williams followed his usual
practice on this occasion, although Mr Sullivan in effect
denied that this had
happened.  At one stage in his evidence Mr Sullivan did concede that Mr
Williams may have asked him whether
he was signing the documents voluntarily.
That Mr Williams entered upon some explanation of the various documents is
supported by
the evidence of Marjory Craig and Craig Kelly.  It is inherently
likely that some explanation would be given by a solicitor, who
knew that he
had to sign a certificate which would be sent to the mortgagee's solicitors.
Mr Williams said that it was part of his
usual practice to have the proposed
guarantor sign the "certificate of understanding," by which he seems to have
meant the document
which I have described as "the notice to
customer/mortgagor/guarantor regarding execution of documents" and Mr
Sullivan's signature
appears on this document    I have found in the case of
the meeting at the Bank that Mr Sullivan's recollection was unreliable. 
It is
true that, as I have found, Mr Williams did not have any copy of the memorandum
at the meeting.  However, I accept that he
would have made assumptions about
the contents of the mortgage including the memorandum, which would be true of
the vast majority
of mortgages, including in the case of a third party mortgage
that the mortgagor would be liable to repay the mortgagee and that,
if there
was a shortfall on realisation of the security, the mortgagor would be liable
for the shortfall.
<P>

193  	If Mr Williams followed his usual practice, the certificate he
gave would be incorrect, inasmuch as he did not, as stated
in paragraph (e) of
the certificate, ask Mr Sullivan in terms whether he had compared his
obligations and responsibilities to the
Bank with those of any other person
named in the document, that is Nobsa, and had considered the consequences to
him, should there
be any default in those obligations or responsibilities.
<P>

194  	Marjory Craig gave evidence in her affidavit that at the
meeting Mr Williams asked Mr Sullivan whether he wanted to get other
legal
advice.  Mr Sullivan denied that Mr Williams had asked him whether he wanted to
get other legal advice or had advised him that
he should obtain other legal
advice before signing the mortgage.
<P>

195  	Mr Williams did not recall whether he had advised Mr Sullivan
to obtain other legal advice but it would not have been in accordance
with his
usual practice to give such advice.  Mr Williams knew that, so far as Craig
Kelly, his client of a number of years standing,
was concerned, the execution
of the mortgage by Mr Sullivan was a matter of urgency and this factor would
have militated against
Mr Williams running the risk of delaying the execution
of the mortgage by advising Mr Sullivan to seek independent legal advice.
<P>

196  	I am satisfied that Mr Williams did not ask Mr Sullivan whether
he wanted to obtain other legal advice or advise Mr Sullivan
that he should
obtain other legal advice.
<P>

197  	Mr Williams could not recall whether at the meeting he had
advised Mr Sullivan to obtain independent financial advice but
he had not had a
practice of suggesting to proposed third party mortgagors that they obtain
independent financial advice and I am
satisfied that he did not advise Mr
Sullivan to obtain independent financial advice or say anything to Mr Sullivan
about what was
the financial position of Nobsa.  At the time of the meeting Mr
Williams was aware, from having received a copy of Nobsa's final
accounts for
the year ended 30 June 1990, that in those accounts there was a deficiency in
shareholders' funds and in working capital.
<P>

198  	A question to which I will return later in this judgment is
whether, if Mr Sullivan had been advised by Mr Williams to obtain
independent
legal advice or independent financial advice, he would have taken such
advice.
<P>

199  	I am satisfied that Mr Williams said nothing to Mr Sullivan
about the provision in the schedule to the mortgage that the mortgage
was
collateral to an equitable mortgage of even date from Nobsa.
<P>

200  	I accept that at the meeting Mr Sullivan said to Mr Williams
words to the effect, "why doesn't Craig give me something to
protect my
interest?" and that Marjory Craig then said, "it's all in the family" and that
nothing further was said on the subject.
<P>

201  	I will now proceed to consider the various issues which arose
between the Bank as the plaintiff and Mr Sullivan, as the defendant
and first
cross-claimant.
<P>

202  	The Bank's case in chief was very simple.  Default had been
made under the mortgage granted by Mr Sullivan to the Bank and
the Bank was
seeking to exercise its remedies under the mortgage of obtaining possession of
the mortgaged property and obtaining
a judgment for the amount due under the
mortgage.
<P>

203  	As I stated near the beginning of this judgment, Mr Sullivan's
defence case was originally pleaded as being based on the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review
Act</a></i>.  However, when I ruled that the Bank would be permitted to contend
that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> did not apply to the mortgage, counsel for
Mr Sullivan sought to rely, and was permitted to rely, on a number of grounds
outside
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>, on which, it was submitted, the Bank
should be refused the relief it was claiming.  However, counsel for Mr Sullivan
did not abandon
reliance on the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> and it is
convenient to begin this examination of the issues between the Bank and Mr
Sullivan with the issue of whether the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> applies to
the mortgage.
<P>

<b>Does the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> apply to the mortgage</b>
<P>

204  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> provides:-
<P>

"(3)	This Act applies to and in relation to a contract only if
<P>

(a)  the law of the State is the proper law of the contract:
<P>

(b)  the proper law of the contract would, but for a term that it should be the
law of some other place or a term to the like effect,
be the law of the State;
or
<P>

(c)  the proper law of the contract would, but for a term that purports to
substitute, or has the effect of substituting, provisions
of the law of some
other place for all or any of the provisions of this Act, be the law of the
State."
<P>

205  	Clause 32 of the Memorandum headed "Governing Law" provided
that the terms of the mortgage should be governed by, and construed
in
accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of
Queensland and that the mortgagor agreed to submit
to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Commonwealth of Australia and the
Courts of the State of Queensland.
<P>

206  	Having regard to the express choice in cl 32 of the laws of the
State of Queensland, the submissions made on behalf of Mr
Sullivan focused on
par(b) of s17(30.  It was submitted that, but for cl 32 of the Memorandum, the
proper law of the mortgage would
have been the law of New South Wales.
<P>

207  	In support of this submission, counsel for Mr Sullivan sought
to rely on the decision of the majority of the New South Wales
Court of Appeal
in <b>Oceanic Sunline Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 242.</a>  In
that case a majority of the Court of Appeal, consisting of McHugh JA and Glass
JA, held that a contract made for a cruise in
the Greek Islands between a
passenger in Australia and a shipping line had been made in New South Wales and
incorporated terms on
a ticket, including a term limiting liability and a term
giving exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of Greece over any claim against
the shipping line.  The plaintiff was injured while on board the cruise vessel
and brought proceedings against the shipping line
in the Supreme Court of New
South Wales.  The shipping line applied for a stay of the proceedings, which
was refused by the judge
of first instance.  
<P>

208  	In <b>Oceanic Sunline</b> McHugh JA held that the judge of
first instance had been correct to refuse a stay, because the contract between
the passenger and
the shipping line had been made in New South Wales and if the
proceedings were heard in New South Wales the plaintiff would be able
to invoke
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>, whereas it was probable, if the action was
heard in Greece, that the plaintiff would not be able to invoke the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> and accordingly, if the proceedings in New South
Wales were stayed, the plaintiff would be deprived of a legitimate personal or
juridical
advantage.  Glass JA agreed with McHugh JA.  Kirby P dissented. 
<P>

209  	It was submitted by counsel for Mr Sullivan that McHugh JA's
judgment was authority for the proposition "that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review
Act</a></i> is a mandatory law of the forum, which applied to give the Supreme
Court jurisdiction, where the effect of the foreign law would
be to deprive a
party of rights set out in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>".  An alternative,
modified submission was also made that his Honour's judgment was authority for
the proposition that, if a contract
is made in New South Wales, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> is to be applied by a New South Wales court.
<P>

210  	I do not consider that either of these submissions should be
upheld.
<P>

211  	It is not the case that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> is "a
mandatory law of the forum" to be applied in any proceedings brought in a New
South Wales court, whatever the connection or
lack of connection between the
contract in question and the State of New South Wales and I do not understand
McHugh JA in <b>Oceanic Sunline</b> to have asserted the contrary.
<P>

212  	Nor do I consider that it is a sufficient condition for the
application of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> to a contract, that the contract
was made in the State of New South Wales.  The statutory test for the
application of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> is whether the proper law of the
contract is the law of the State (or would, but for a choice of law provision
in the contract, be
the law of the State) and where the contract was made,
although relevant, is not necessarily determinative of what the proper law
of
the contract is.  McHugh JA in his judgment in <b>Oceanic Sunline</b> made no
reference to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s17(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> but would appear to have
treated the question of where the contract was made, to which his Honour
devoted considerable attention,
as being determinative, in the circumstances of
the particular case, of what was the proper law of the contract.
<P>

213  	Kirby P in his dissenting judgment in <b>Oceanic Sunline</b>
pointed out (at 258) that the judge at first instance had not made any explicit
finding as to what was the proper law of the contract.
 Kirby P proceeded to
say that, even if the contract was made in New South Wales, that would not
necessarily determine the proper
law of the contract, because the proper law of
the contract remained the law of the place with which the contract had its
closest
and most real connection. <b>Bonython v Commonwealth of Australia</b>

214  	An appeal was brought to the High Court from the decision of
the Court of Appeal in <b>Oceanic Sunline</b> and the decision of the High
Court is reported <b>Oceanic Sunline Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988)
165 CLR 197.</a>
<P>

215  	On the appeal all member of the High Court held that the
contract of carriage had been made in New South Wales and that the
terms on the
ticket did not form part of the contract.  Accordingly, the exclusive
jurisdiction clause in one of the terms on the
ticket, not having become part
of the contract, did not present any obstacle to the plaintiff's proceedings
being brought in the
Supreme Court of New South Wales and it was unnecessary
for the judges of the High Court to deal with the application of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> to the contract.
<P>

216  	The only member of the High Court to refer to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act</a></i> was Brennan J who said at 231:-
<P>

217  	"Moreover, if the exclusive foreign jurisdiction clause had
been part of the contract of carriage, Greek law would probably
have been held
to be the proper law of the contract and the contract would thus have been
outside the reach of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>;  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s17(3)(a)".</a>
<P>

218  	It seems to me, with respect, that Brennan J in the High Court
was clearly correct in saying that, if Greek law was the proper
law of the
contract, the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> would not apply.
<P>

219  	An alternative submission was made by counsel for Mr Sullivan
that, but for cl32 of the Memorandum, the proper law of the
mortgage would have
been the law of the State of New South Wales, as being the system of law of the
place with which the contract
consisting of the mortgage had its closest and
most real connection.  Counsel pointed to various factors connecting the
contract
with New South Wales, including that the mortgage was executed in New
South Wales, the Bank carried on business principally in New
South Wales, the
principal debtor Nobsa was a New South Wales company, the mortgage contained
personal covenants by Mr Sullivan to
pay money and the place for payment, in
the absence of any contrary direction by the Bank, was in New South Wales and
the mortgage
was expressed to be collateral to an equitable mortgage from
Nobsa, the proper law of which, if the equitable mortgage was independently
considered, would be the law of New South Wales.
<P>

220  	I do not consider that this submission made by counsel for Mr
Sullivan should be accepted.  In my opinion, the crucial factors
in determining
with which system of law the contract had its closest and most real connection
are that the contract was a mortgage
of land in Queensland subject to the
Queensland <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i>, that the mortgage was registered at the
Queensland Land Titles Office and that it contained references to Queensland
Statute law.
 I note in passing that Mr Sullivan, the mortgagor, was a resident
of Queensland.

Executors and Agency Company Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55 CLR 483</a> is directly, or
virtually directly, in point.  In that case all four members of the High Court
held that the proper law of a mortgage
of land in New South Wales under the New
South Wales <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i>, which was registered in New South Wales
and which incorporated some provisions of New South Wales Statute law and
excluded others
was the law of New South Wales, even though the mortgagor was a
resident of Victoria, the mortgagee was a company incorporated in
Victoria and
the mortgage had been executed in Victoria.
<P>

222  	The only was in which counsel for Mr Sullivan attempted to
distinguish <b>McClelland</b> was to say that in <b>McClelland</b> the mortgage
had not been expressed to be collateral to another contract, the proper law of
which, if determined independently of
the mortgage, would have been the law of
a place, other than the place where the land was situated.  In my opinion, this
circumstance
is quite insufficient to distinguish <b>McClelland</b>.
<P>

223  	Counsel also sought to distinguish an earlier High Court
decision <b>Merwin Pastoral Company Proprietary Limited v Moolpa Pastoral
Proprietary Company Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2048%20CLR%20565" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 48 CLR 565</a> and I would accept that this
decision, which was concerned with the proper law of a contract for the sale of
immovable property,
is not as close to the present case as <b>McClelland</b>
is.
<P>

224  	Both on general principle and on the authority of the decision
of the High Court in <b>McClelland</b>, I find that the place with which the
mortgage had its closest and most real connection was Queensland.  Accordingly,
even if cl
32 of the Memorandum is disregarded, the proper law of the mortgage
would be the law of Queensland and the New South Wales <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review
Act</a></i> would not apply.
<P>

<b>Is the Bank estopped from asserting that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>
does not apply to the mortgage.</b>
<P>

225  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that, even if, apart
from any estoppel, the <i>Contract Review Act</i> does not apply to the
mortgage, nevertheless the Bank was estopped from asserting that the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> does not apply to the mortgage.
<P>

226  	This submission was based on evidence by Mr Sullivan's
solicitor, Mr Dobson, and particularly on evidence of conversations
and
correspondence in 1994 between himself and the solicitors acting for the Bank.
This evidence, which I accept, can be briefly
summarised as follows:-
<P>

227  	On 28 March 1994 the Bank's solicitors wrote a letter to Mr
Sullivan, demanding that he give up possession of the land to
the Bank.  This
letter was referred by Mr Sullivan to his solicitors.  On 7 April 1994 Mr
Dobson had a telephone conversation with
a solicitor acting for the Bank, in
which he said that Mr Sullivan would not be giving up possession, for reasons
based on the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>.  On the same day Mr Dobson wrote a
letter to the Bank's solicitors, in which it was contended that the contract
consisting of the
mortgage was unjust and that Mr Sullivan was entitled to
relief under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>.   Mr Dobson suggested that the
Bank should commence legal proceedings and that the appropriate forum for such
proceedings would
be New South Wales.
<P>

228  	On 12 May 1994 the Bank's solicitors wrote a letter to Mr
Dobson, in which they said that the Bank would not agree to the
proceedings
being brought in New South Wales, unless Mr Sullivan gave an undertaking that,
if the proceedings were brought in New
South Wales and judgment for possession
was obtained by the Bank, Mr Sullivan would vacate the land, without the need
to register
the New South Wales judgment in Queensland.  After some delay Mr
Sullivan gave an undertaking in writing, in which he undertook to
give vacant
possession of the land immediately, if a judgment for possession was obtained
against him in proceedings brought in New
South Wales.  Subsequently, the Bank
commenced the present proceedings.  In these proceedings a cross-claim was
filed on behalf of
Mr Sullivan in which the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> was
pleaded and a defence to the cross-claim was filed on behalf of the Bank, in
which it was alleged that the contract was not unjust.
<P>

229  	Mr Dobson stated in his affidavit that at no time had the
Bank's solicitors said to him that the Bank contended that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act</a></i> did not apply and that he, Mr Dobson, had assumed, right up
until 10 February 1999, that there was no issue but that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act</a></i> did apply to the mortgage.
<P>

230  	It was submitted, largely on the basis of the evidence which I
have just summarised, that the doctrine of estoppel as discussed
by the High
Court in <b>Commonwealth v Verwayen </b>(1990) 170 CLR 394 was applicable, with
the consequence that the Bank was estopped from asserting that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act</a></i> did not apply to the mortgage.
<P>

231  	I do not consider that this submission should be upheld.
<P>

232  	In the first place, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s17(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>
provides that the Act applies to a contract, "only if" one or other of the
conditions in pars(a), (b) or (c) is satisfied and, having
regard to the
conclusion I have already stated to the effect that none of the conditions in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s17(3)</a> were satisfied, any application of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> to
the mortgage would be directly contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s17(3).</a>  I note, however, that it
was said in <b>Verwayen</b>, for example by Deane J at 445, that an assumption
of law may give rise to an estoppel.
<P>

233  	In the second place, I do not consider that the elements of an
estoppel, as stated in <b>Verwayen</b> (for example by Deane J at 444-446) have
been established.  
<P>

234  	Mr Sullivan himself admitted in evidence that he could not
recall the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> ever having been mentioned to him by Mr
Dobson.  Mr Sullivan himself clearly made no assumption that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts
Review Act</a></i> applied.
<P>

235  	I accept that Mr Dobson assumed, at least up until 10 February
1999, that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> applied to the mortgage but this was
an assumption which he had himself made, before he first communicated with the
Bank's solicitors
and the Bank's solicitors played no part in inducing this
assumption.  Furthermore, the Bank's solicitors did not in any conversation
or
letter make any positive representation that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>
applied to the mortgage.
<P>

236  	I accept evidence by Mr Joiner, a bank officer, that up until 9
February 1999 the Bank had never been advised that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review
Act</a></i> might not apply to the mortgage, by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s17(3)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i>.  The Bank, accordingly, did not know up until 9
February 1999 that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> might not apply to the
mortgage and there was, consequently, no deliberate decision by the Bank not to
avail itself of a defence
(to Mr Sullivan's claim under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review
Act</a></i>), which the Bank knew was available.  The position in the present case
is in stark contrast with the facts in <b>Verwayen</b> itself, where the
Commonwealth sought at a late stage in the proceedings to put in issue an
allegation of negligence and to rely
on a defence under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></i>, in circumstances where the Commonwealth had earlier, in full knowledge
of its legal rights, expressly and deliberately disavowed
any intention of
doing so.
<P>

237  	In the circumstances I have outlined, it was not unconscionable
or unconscientious for the Bank to depart from an assumption
that Mr Dobson had
formed that the <i>Contacts Review Act</i> applied to the mortgage.  The
present case is an example of the common kind of case, where a party to
litigation at a late stage
of the proceedings applies to amend a pleading,
because a claim or defence has, for the first time, occurred to its legal
advisers.
 In such a case leave to amend may or may not be granted.  However, a
party seeking leave to amend is not prevented from raising
the claim or defence
by the doctrine of estoppel, even thought the opposite party may have been
proceeding on an assumption that
the claim or defence will not be raised.
<P>

238  	I conclude that the Bank is not estopped from asserting that
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</a></i> does not apply to the mortgage.
<P>

<b>Does s52A (now s51AB) of the <i>Trade Practices Act </i>apply to the
mortgage</b>
<P>

239  	At the time the mortgage was entered into, s52A of the <i>Trade
Practices Act</i> provided in part as follows:-
<P>

"(1) A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the
supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person,
engage in conduct
that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>

(5) A reference in this section to goods or services is a reference to goods or
services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal,
domestic or household use
or consumption".
<P>

240  	Section 52A of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> has since been
re-enacted as s51AB of the Act.
<P>

241  	Under s4 of the Act "services" are defined so as to include any
right, benefits, privileges or facilities provided, granted
or conferred
under.... "(d) any contract for or in relation to the lending of monies".
Accordingly, the Bank in taking a mortgage
from Mr Sullivan to secure the
indebtedness of Nobsa to the Bank for money lent by the Bank to Nobsa was
engaging in conduct in connection
with the supply of services.
<P>

242  	However, the question remains whether under ss(5) of s52A the
services the Bank was supplying were services "of a kind ordinarily
acquired
for personal, domestic or household use or consumption".
<P>

243  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that, although the
monies had been advanced to Nobsa for use in carrying on its
business, the
lending of money is a service of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal,
domestic or household use and that consequently
ss(5) was satisfied.  It was
conceded by counsel for Mr Sullivan that the decision of Drummond J of the
Federal Court of Australia
in <b>Begbie v State Bank of New South Wales</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/579.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 579</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20ATPR%2041%2d288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) ATPR 41-288</a> was opposed to this submission.  In <b>Begbie </b> the
applicant, Mrs Begbie, who had fallen under the influence of a man named
Cheers, executed a mortgage over her property in favour
of the Bank, as
security for overdraft accommodation provided by the Bank to Cheers, which
Cheers used for business purposes.  Drummond
J held that Mrs Begbie was
entitled to succeed against the Bank on other grounds but that she was not
entitled to succeed against
the Bank under s52A of the <i>Trade Practices
Act</i>.  Whether s52A applied depended on whether ss(5) was satisfied.  In his
judgment Drummond J said at 41,898:-
<P>

"The borrowing of funds, even substantial in amount, e.g., the borrowing of
funds by a person sufficient to enable that person to
buy a private residence,
can be a service of such a kind.  In order to determine whether the service in
question in a particular
case in which s52A (now s51AB) is relied on is one
within s52A(5) (now s51AB(5)), it is in my view necessary to have regard not
just
to the activity, here the provision of loan funds, but also to the purpose
that activity is intended, in the particular case, to
serve.  Only then can the
true nature of the services in connection with which it is said the respondent
has acted unconscionably
be identified and a proper answer given to the
question posed by s52A(5).  The provision of such a large sum as $250,000.00 by
way
of overdraft accommodation for the purpose of assisting a corporation to
buy a business, to enable it to assist a director to pay
off his own personal
indebtedness to another and to assist it to undertake the commercial
development of real estate is not a service
of the kind referred to in the
sub-section".
<P>

244  	It was submitted by counsel for Mr Sullivan that I should not
follow <b>Begbie v State Bank</b>, because interpreting ss(5) in such a way as
to have regard to the purpose for which, in the particular case, the monies
lent were
to be used, was inconsistent with the language of ss(5), "services of
a kind ordinarily acquired".
<P>

245  	It was further submitted that I could obtain guidance on the
proper interpretation of s52A(5) from the judgment of Lehane
J of the Federal
Court in <b>Crago &amp; Anor v Multiquip Pty Limited</b> (unreported 21
September 1998).  The issue in <b>Crago</b> was whether claims arising from the
supply of incubators for incubating ostrich eggs came within s74B and s74D of
the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>.  The claims would come within those sections,
if the person to whom the goods were supplied was "a consumer" and this
question in
turn would depend on whether the goods supplied "were of a kind
ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption".
Lehane J disposed of the claims by holding that the applicants had not
established that the incubators were goods of a kind ordinarily
acquired for
personal, domestic or household use.  Counsel for Mr Sullivan fastened on some
dicta by Lehane J and particularly a
remark at 28:-
<P>

"Goods may be of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal use, even if goods of
the same kind are in many cases acquired for business
use".
<P>

246  	It was submitted that the proper enquiry was whether the goods
(or services) were of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal,
domestic or
household use, not whether in a particular case they would, after having been
supplied, be used for such purposes.
<P>

247  	I consider that I should follow the decision of Drummond J in
<b>Begbie v State Bank</b>, which is a decision of a judge of the Federal Court
directly in point on s52A itself.  If the construction advocated by counsel
for
Mr Sullivan is adopted and no regard is had to the use to which the particular
borrower puts the borrowed money, then a consequence,
as counsel for Mr
Sullivan acknowledged, would be that any loan of money, even to a large
industrial or commercial enterprise to
be used for the purposes of the
enterprise, would fall within s52A (s51AB).  If the test stated by Drummond J
is applied, then the
services supplied by the Bank would not fall within
s52A.
<P>

248  	I conclude that s52A of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> does not
apply to the mortgage.
<P>

<b>Did Mr Lyons at the meeting at the Bank make a misrepresentation on which Mr
Sullivan relied.</b>
<P>

249  	A submission by counsel for Mr Sullivan that Mr Lyons had made
a misrepresentation to Mr Sullivan was sought to be based on
Mr Lyons' evidence
that he had a practice, when there was a proposed third party mortgagor, to
"point out the fact, if there was
a default, the Bank, after taking due
recourse, might be forced to sell up the security property".
<P>

250  	It was submitted that if, as should be inferred, Mr Lyons had
followed what he said was his practice when he was speaking
to Mr Sullivan,
then what Mr Lyons would have said would have been incorrect in two respects,
in that Mr Lyons would have represented
that Mr Sullivan's liability would be
limited to a sale of his house and would not extend to the giving of an
unlimited personal
covenant and Mr Lyons would have represented that, in the
event of default, recourse would be had, in the first instance, against
the
principal debtor, and not Mr Sullivan.
<P>

251  	I do not consider that this submission should be accepted.
<P>

252  	I do not consider, as a matter of language, that what Mr Lyons
said (if he followed his practice) would have been open to
either of the
constructions sought to be placed on it.  In saying that the Bank, if there was
default, might be forced to sell the
mortgaged property, Mr Lyons was merely
drawing attention, in a non-exclusive way, to one of the principal possible
consequences
of a default.  I do not consider that a meaning that, in the event
of default, the Bank would first have to exercise what rights
it had against
the principal debtor can be spelt out of the words "after taking due recourse"
can be spelt out of the words "after
taking due recourse", which might merely
mean the taking of preliminary steps against Mr Sullivan, such as making a
demand and obtaining
possession of the land.
<P>

253  	Nor do I consider that Mr Sullivan would have understood what
was said in the ways contended for or that, even if he did,
what Mr Lyons said
played any part in Mr Sullivan's decision to enter into the mortgage.
<P>

254  	Mr Sullivan did not give any evidence that Mr Lyons had said to
him what it was submitted Mr Lyons had said or that he had
placed any reliance
on what Mr Lyons had said.  As I have already found, the meeting at the Bank
took place, not shortly before Mr
Sullivan entered into the mortgage, but more
than two months before he entered into the mortgage and it is unlikely that
what Mr
Lyons said was continuing to operate on Mr Sullivan's mind at the time
he entered into the mortgage.  Mr Sullivan had entered into
many mortgages and
understood that a standard feature of a mortgage was a personal obligation on
the mortgagor to repay the monies
lent.  As I have already found, Mr Sullivan
knew, immediately prior to going to Mr Williams' office on 14 November 1990,
that he
was going to sign a mortgage, that he was guaranteeing the indebtedness
of Nobsa to the Bank, that the money which Nobsa owed to
the Bank would have to
be paid to the Bank, that there was no limit on Mr Sullivan's liability and
that if there was a default the
Bank would have rights against the land.  I
have also found that at the meeting at Mr Williams' office Mr Williams followed
what
he said was his usual practice when asking someone to sign a guarantee or
a third party mortgage.
<P>

255  	I conclude that Mr Lyons did not at the meeting at the Bank
make any misrepresentation on which Mr Sullivan relied in deciding
to enter
into the mortgage.
<P>

<b>Is Mr Sullivan relieved of liability because no equitable mortgage was
executed by Nobsa</b>
<P>

256  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that it was a term
and condition of the mortgage or of the arrangements leading
up to the
execution of the mortgage that there would be an equitable mortgage of the same
date from Nobsa, that no equitable mortgage
had been given by Nobsa and that in
those circumstances Mr Sullivan was relieved of all liability under the
mortgage and, indeed,
had never assumed any liability under the mortgage.
Alternatively, it was submitted that Mr Sullivan was entitled to relief on
equitable
grounds, because no equitable mortgage had been given by Nobsa, but
ultimately this alternative submission was virtually abandoned.
<P>

257  	These submissions relied heavily on the inclusion in the
mortgage of cl 2 in the Schedule to the mortgage, which provided:-
<P>

"2.	This mortgage is collateral to equitable mortgage of even date from Nobsa
Holdings Pty Limited".
<P>

258  	It is necessary to make some findings of fact on the subject of
the giving of an equitable mortgage by Nobsa.
<P>

259  	It is clear that both the Bank and Craig Kelly, both in his own
right and as the person who was controlling Nobsa, intended
that Nobsa should
give an equitable mortgage.  For example, in both the application and the
supplement to the application prepared
by Mr Lyons, the security proposed to be
substituted for the mortgage over Mr Ahmet's property is described as the
mortgage to be
given by Mr Sullivan and "a registered equitable mortgage and
floating charge over assets and undertaking of Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited".
 By
its letter of 2 October 1990 in which it advised that approval had been given
to the proposal for the substitution of securities,
the Bank advised Craig
Kelly that an equitable mortgage and floating charge would be taken over
Nobsa's assets and undertaking.
<P>

260  	On the other hand, I am satisfied that the giving of an
equitable mortgage by Nobsa was never mentioned to Mr Sullivan in
any of the
discussions before 14 November 1990 or at the meeting at Mr Williams' office on
14 November 1990 and was a matter to which
he had never given any thought at
all.  I am satisfied that on 14 November 1990 Mr Williams did not draw Mr
Sullivan's attention
to cl2 in the Schedule to the mortgage and that Mr
Sullivan was quite unconscious of the inclusion of cl2 in the mortgage.
<P>

261  	The Bank did not concede that Nobsa did not execute an
equitable mortgage.  However, I consider that I should find that Nobsa
did not
execute an equitable mortgage.  If Nobsa had executed an equitable mortgage,
then one would have expected the mortgage not
yet executed to have been
enclosed with the Banks solicitor's letter to Mr Williams of 26 October 1990
but no such document was enclosed.
 A document described as an "equitable
mortgage" was enclosed with the letter of 26 October 1990 but this document was
an equitable
mortgage from the individual Craig Kelly.  It would appear, quite
inexplicably so far as the evidence before me goes, that the Bank's
solicitors
prepared and forwarded to Mr Williams an equitable mortgage, not from the
company Nobsa, but from the individual Craig
Kelly.
<P>

262  	In par6 of his affidavit of 3 July 1997 Mr Williams said that a
number of documents were executed in his presence on 14 November
1990, which he
proceeded to list.  In his list of documents Mr Williams included an equitable
mortgage between Craig Kelly and the
Bank but made no reference to any
equitable mortgage from Nobsa to the Bank.
<P>

263  	Most significantly of all, notwithstanding calls made at the
hearing of these proceedings by counsel for Mr Sullivan that
the Bank should
produce any equitable mortgage from Nobsa to the Bank, and the obvious forensic
advantage the Bank would derive if
it could produce such a document, no such
document was produced.
<P>

264  	The conclusion that Nobsa did not execute a documentary
equitable mortgage on 14 November 1990 does not entail the conclusion
that
there was no "equitable mortgage of even date from Nobsa Holdings Pty Limited".
The security which Nobsa, as a principal debtor,
was to give was an equitable
mortgage, not a fixed mortgage.  I am satisfied that Nobsa, by its controller
Craig Kelly, had agreed
to give an equitable mortgage over its assets and
undertaking and I am further satisfied that that agreement by itself gave rise
to a security in favour of the Bank and that as at 14 November 1990 that
agreement would have been specifically enforceable by the
Bank so as to require
the execution by Nobsa of a documentary equitable mortgage.  An equitable
mortgage by a company over its assets
and undertaking is a very common,
standard document and I do not consider that the agreement was prevented from
being specifically
enforceable by the Bank, by the circumstance that the terms
of such an equitable mortgage had not been settled between the parties.
<P>

265  	I can now return to a consideration of the submissions made by
counsel for Mr Sullivan.
<P>

266  	It is clear that it was not a term of any arrangements leading
up to the execution of the mortgage, to which Mr Sullivan was
a party, that
there should be an equitable mortgage from Nobsa.  As I have already found, the
giving of an equitable mortgage by
Nobsa was not a matter which had ever been
mentioned to Mr Sullivan or to which he had given any thought.
<P>

267  	The question arises whether cl2 in the Schedule to the
mortgage, on its proper interpretation, constituted a condition, such
that Mr
Sullivan would not be subject to any liability under the mortgage, unless Nobsa
gave an equitable mortgage.  
<P>

268  	Clause 2 in the Schedule does not explicitly so provide and I
do not consider, when it is interpreted in the context of the
whole of the
mortgage document, that it should be held to have this interpretation.  I
particularly have regard to the provisions
of cl 512 of the Memorandum
(applying where the mortgagor is a surety), cl 513, cl 29 and cl 36.
<P>

269  	To the extent to which it is permissible to have regard to
extrinsic circumstances in interpreting cl2, the interpretation
I favour is
confirmed.  The real security the Bank was taking, in substitution for the
mortgage over Mr Ahmet's land, was a mortgage
over Mr Sullivan's land, and not
an equitable mortgage by a company which was in a serious financial plight.

<P>

270  	In my opinion cl2 in the Memorandum should be interpreted as
simply evincing an intention that another party, Nobsa, should
also give a
security.  For reasons which I have already given, I am not satisfied that
there was actually any non-fulfilment of such
a provision.  Even if there was a
non-fulfilment of this provision, then, assuming (as I was urged to do) that
the principles enunciated
by Powell J in <b>Marston v Charles H Griffith &amp;
Co Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 294</a> in the case of intending co-guarantors,
should be applied, with necessary adjustments, to the present case, then,
adapting the second
principle enunciated by Powell J, any presumption that the
giving of an equitable mortgage by Nobsa was a condition precedent to
Mr
Sullivan becoming liable under the mortgage can be rebutted.  In the present
circumstances such a presumption would be rebutted
by the terms of the mortgage
considered as a whole and the surrounding circumstances, including Nobsa's
financial state and Mr Sullivan's
complete lack of knowledge of any proposed
equitable mortgage or of the provisions of cl 2 in the Schedule.
<P>

271  	I conclude that Mr Sullivan is not relieved of liability
because no equitable mortgage was executed by Nobsa.
<P>

<b>Did the Bank fail to perform its duty of disclosure to Mr Sullivan as an
intending guarantor</b>
<P>

272  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that the Bank had
failed to perform its duty of disclosure to Mr Sullivan as an
intending
guarantor, as referred to in <b>Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v
Amadio</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%2d1983%29%20151%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982-1983) 151 CLR 447</a> per Gibbs CJ at 454-458 and Mason J at
463.
<P>

273  	In <b>Amadio</b> Gibbs CJ at 454-458 said inter alia:-
<P>

"A contract of guarantee is not uberrimae fidei".  
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

.. "a bank which takes a guarantee `is only bound to disclose to the intending
surety anything which has taken place between the
bank and the principal debtor
`which was not naturally to be expected'.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"The reason why a creditor is bound to reveal to an intending surety anything
in the transaction between himself and the debtor
which the surety would expect
not to exist is that a failure to make disclosure in those circumstances would
amount to an implied
representation that the thing does not exist".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"A surety who guarantees a customer's account with a bank will not expect that
the account has not been overdrawn or that the bank
is satisfied with the
customer's credit, for the probable reason why the bank requires the guarantee
is that the customer has been
overdrawing his account, and wishes to do so
again, and that the bank is not satisfied with his credit....  The general rule
therefore
is that a bank is not obliged to disclose to the surety matters
affecting the credit of the customer".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

274  	"...at least in the case of banker and customer the duty of
disclosure arises only where there is a special arrangement between
the bank
and the customer of a kind which the surety would not expect".
<P>

275  	Gibbs CJ then turned to the particular facts in <b>Amadio</b>.
His Honour said inter alia:-
<P>

"The facts that the company was in grave financial difficulties, and was
consistently exceeding its overdraft limit, and that its
cheques were being
dishonoured, in themselves did no more than throw light on the credit of the
company.  It there were no more to
the case than that, in my opinion the bank
would not have been bound to make disclosure of those facts".
<P>

276  	However, Gibbs CJ went on to hold that there were other
circumstances besides those to which he had already referred, that
an
arrangement had been made between the bank and its customer (the principal
debtor) that, within a short time, the customer's overdraft
limit was to be
reduced below the existing debit balance and then the overdraft was to be
entirely cleared and that the bank had
made itself a party to a selective
dishonouring of cheques drawn by the company, in an endeavour to maintain a
facade of prosperity
for the company.  Gibbs CJ concluded that the failure by
the bank to disclose these circumstances amounted to a misrepresentation
of a
material part of the transaction between the bank and the company and that
therefore the guarantee and the security given by
the guarantor were not
binding.
<P>

277  	At p463 Mason J said:-
<P>

"To say this involves no contradiction of the well-entrenched proposition that
a guarantee is not a contract uberrimae fidei, that
is, a contract which of
itself calls for full disclosure.  However, it is accepted that the principal
creditor is under a duty
<P>

`... to disclose to the intending surety anything which has taken place between
the bank and the principal debtor `which was not
naturally to be expected', or
as it was put by Pollock M.R., in <i>Lloyds Bank Ltd v Harrison</i> (1925)
unreported cited in <i>Paget's Law of Banking, </i>7th ed. (1966) p583 `the
necessity for disclosure only goes to the extent of requiring it where there
are some unusual features in
the particular case relating to the particular
account which is to be guaranteed'
<P>

278  	<i>(Goodwin v National Bank of Australasia Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1968/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20117%20CLR%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 117
CLR 173</a> at p175, per Barwick CJ).
<P>

It has been said that this duty to disclose does not require a bank to give
information as to matters affecting the credit of the
debtor or of any
circumstances connected with the transaction in which he is about to engage
which will render his position more
hazardous (Wythes v Labouchere
<i>(</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1859%29%203%20De%20G%20%26%20J%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1859) 3 De G &amp; J 593</a> at p609  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=44%20ER%201397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[44 ER 1397</a> at p1404], per Lord
Chelmsford LC).  No surety is entitled to assume that the debtor has not been
overdrawing, the proper presumption
being in most instances that he has been
doing so and wishes to do so again (<i>London General Omnibus Co Ltd v
Holloway</i> ([1912] 2 KB 72, at pp 83-84, 87
<P>

279  	Reference was also made by counsel to the judgment of Clarke JA
(with whose judgment Handley JA agreed) in <b>Westpac Banking Corporation v
Robinson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20668" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 668</a> at 688-690.  Clarke JA observed that the duty
owed to an intending guarantor is to disclose circumstances not naturally to be
expected
in the transaction, where a non-disclosure of the circumstances would
amount to a misrepresentation that the circumstances did not
exist.
<P>

280  	It was conceded by counsel for Mr Sullivan that the remarks of
Gibbs CJ in <b>Amadio </b>are express authority that a bank is not obliged to
disclose to an intending guarantor that the bank's customer, the principal
debtor,
is in grave financial difficulty or that the debit balance on its
account with the bank exceeds the overdraft limit.
<P>

281  	It was, however, submitted that there were a number of
circumstances not naturally to be expected, which ought to have been
disclosed
by the Bank, but had not.  The principal circumstances relied on were:-
<P>

282  	1.	As recorded in the proposal of 1 August 1990, Nobsa's
accountant had said to the manager of the Bank's Sutherland Branch
that
"Cascades can meet its own financial repayments on its own".
<P>

283  	2.	As recorded in the branch watch and classified account
report of 28 June 1990, the Bank's officer Mr Ray considered that
the business
(carried on by Nobsa) was not performing and the capacity to service its loans
was non-existent and that recovery action
should be commenced, unless
satisfactory arrangements were made for repayment of the loan or repayment was
obtained from a sale of
security or from a re-financing of the indebtedness.
<P>

284  	3.	As recorded in the supplement to the application, Mr Lyons
considered that if the business was to trade out of its difficulties,
its debt
level would have to be reduced drastically and this could only be achieved by a
successful sale of Craig Kelly's property.
<P>

285  	4.	On 19 October 1990, after the manager of the Sutherland
Branch had reported that Craig Kelly's house had not been sold
at the auction
on 13 October, the Bank's regional lending manager had decided "if debt not
reduced to $250,000 by 15/11/90, submit
for call-up (please advise clients
accordingly of our intentions)".
<P>

286  	5.	The security to be given by the intending guarantor, Mr
Sullivan, and not the proposed equitable mortgage from the principal
debtor,
was to be, and was regarded by the Bank as being, the primary security for
Nobsa's indebtedness, so that if the Bank took
recovery action Mr Sullivan
would be "the real funder of the company's losses".
<P>

287  	6.	If Craig Kelly's property was sold, part of the proceeds of
sale would be applied, not in payment of the indebtedness of
Nobsa, but in
payment of Craig Kelly's personal indebtedness to the Bank.
<P>

288  	As to all of these circumstances, I make the general comment
that none of them, with the possible exception of 4, to which
I will return,
was an arrangement between the Bank and Nobsa, so that if the duty of
disclosure arises, as Gibbs CJ said in <b>Amadio</b>, "only where there is a
special arrangement between the bank and the customer of a kind which the
surety would not expect", then
none of these circumstances had to be disclosed
by the Bank.
<P>

289  	I make the following specific comments, on the basis that it is
sufficient to give rise to an obligation to disclose that
a circumstance is not
naturally to be expected, even though it does not take the form of a special
arrangement between the bank and
its customer.
<P>

290  	As to circumstance 1:-
<P>

291  	 I do not consider that it is a circumstance not naturally to
be expected that the customer's accountant had at one time in
a conversation
with an officer of the Bank expressed what the officer considered to be an
over-optimistic view of the capacity of
the customer to meet its
commitments.
<P>

292  	As to circumstance 2:-
<P>

293  	Mr Ray's opinion that the business was not performing and that
the business had no capacity to serve its loans was an opinion
about matters
affecting the credit of Nobsa and did not need to be disclosed.  
<P>

294  	A statement in a bank internal document that recovery action
would have to be commenced against a customer whose account is
overdrawn,
unless satisfactory arrangements are made for repayment or repayment is
obtained from the sale of security or from re-financing,
is a kind of statement
naturally to be expected in a bank record.  If a bank is not obliged to
disclose that a customer's account
is overdrawn, because that is a circumstance
naturally to be expected by an intending guarantor, then consideration by the
bank of
means whereby the customer's indebtedness can be cleared and of
contingency plans for bringing recovery action is also to be expected.
<P>

295  	As to circumstance 3:-
<P>

296  	For much the same reasons as apply to circumstance 2, I
consider that this circumstance was not a circumstance not naturally
to be
expected, such that non-disclosure of it would amount to a misrepresentation
that it did not exist.  I do not consider that
in making the remark that
Nobsa's debt level could only be reduced drastically by a successful sale of
Craig Kelly's property, Mr
Lyons was confining a "successful sale" of Craig
Kelly's property to a sale precisely in accordance with the kind of sale
assumed
in the cash flow.
<P>

297  	As to circumstance 5:-
<P>

298  	It is true that the security to be given by Mr Sullivan, and
not the proposed equitable mortgage from Nobsa, was, and was
regarded by the
Bank as being, the primary security for Nobsa's indebtedness.  However, Mr
Sullivan knew that the mortgage over Craig
Kelly's property and the security to
be given by him would be the primary securities for Nobsa's indebtedness to the
Bank.  Mr Sullivan
was quite unaware of any security to be given by Nobsa.
<P>

299  	As to circumstance 6:-
<P>

300  	Mr Sullivan was aware that Craig Kelly owed money to the Bank
and it was not a circumstance not naturally to be expected that
part of the
proceeds of any sale of Craig Kelly's property would be applied in payment of
his personal indebtedness to the Bank.
<P>

301  	I return to circumstance 4.  It was submitted that it was a
circumstance not naturally to be expected by an intending surety
that the
Bank's branch manager had been instructed that, if the principal debtor's
indebtedness was not reduced to a certain figure
by the day after the intending
surety entered into the guarantee, the manager should submit the matter for
"call-up", that is the
taking of recovery action.  
<P>

302  	I do not, however, consider that in the circumstances this
particular circumstance needed to be disclosed.  The agreed limit
of the
overdraft account had been increased to $250,000.  As set out in the
application of 14 September 1990, it was part of the
arrangement between the
Bank and Nobsa that Marjory Craig was to provide $40,000.  I find that as at 19
October 1990 (and at other
material times) it was anticipated by the Bank, and
the Bank had good grounds for anticipating, that Marjory Craig would comply
with
this part of the arrangement and that, if by no other means, the funds
contributed by her would bring the indebtedness of Nobsa down
to or below
$250,000.  In the event, Marjory Craig did provide $40,000 and the balance of
the overdraft account was reduced to less
than $250,000.  No recovery action
was in fact taken by the Bank on or shortly after  15 November 1990.  
<P>

303  	In my opinion, the Bank did not fail to perform the duty of
disclosure to Mr Sullivan as an intending guarantor under the
principles
referred to in the judgment of Gibbs CJ in <b>Amadio</b>..
<P>

<b>Whether the mortgage should be set aside as an unconscionable bargain</b>
<P>

304  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that the mortgage
should be set aside under the principle of unconscionability discussed
by the
High Court in <b>Amadio</b>.  It was also submitted that the mortgage should be
set aside under the principles stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, with the
concurrence
of the other law Lords, in <b>Barclays Bank PLC v O'Brien</b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 AC 180</a> or under the principles stated by Kirby J in <b>Garcia v
National Australia Bank</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 1243</a> at par73 and described by his
Honour as a "re-formulation" of the principles stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson
in <b>O'Brien</b>.  It is convenient first to consider <b>O'Brien</b> and the
judgment of Kirby J in <b>Garcia<i>.</i></b>
<P>

305  	In <b>O'Brien</b> a husband and wife had executed a mortgage in
favour of a bank to secure advances to a company in which the husband, but not
the
wife, had an interest.  The wife signed the mortgage without reading it, in
reliance on false representations by her husband that
her liability under the
mortgage was limited in amount and would last only three weeks.  It was held by
the House of Lords that there
was no basis for providing special protection in
equity to wives in relation to surety transactions.  However, it was held by
the
House of Lords that the wife was entitled as against the bank to set aside
the mortgage, on the grounds that the wife had been induced
to sign the
mortgage by her husband's misrepresentations, that she therefore had an equity
against her husband to set aside the transaction,
that that equity would be
enforceable against a third party who had actual or constructive notice of the
circumstances giving rise
to the equity and that the bank had had such
constructive notice.  The bank was put on enquiry, because the wife was
offering to
be a surety in a transaction which was not to her financial
advantage and which carried a substantial risk of the husband committing
a
legal or equitable wrong entitling the wife to set aside the transaction.
Having been put on enquiry, the bank would be fixed with
constructive notice,
unless it took reasonable steps to ensure that the wife's agreement to become a
surety had been properly obtained.
<P>

306  	<b>O'Brien</b> was a case involving a husband and a wife.
However, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said that the same principles were applicable to
all other
cases, where there is an emotional relationship between co-habitees.
His Lordship then said that the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <b>Avon
Finance Co Limited v Bridger</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20All%20ER%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 All ER 281</a> showed that other
relationships could give rise to a similar result.
<P>

307  	The status of <b>O'Brien</b> in Australia is uncertain.  
<P>

308  	<b>O'Brien</b> was applied by Santow J in <b>Burke v State Bank
of New South Wales</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 53</a> especially at 76-78.  In <b>Burke</b>
a husband and a wife had mortgaged their home to the bank as security for a
loan by the bank to their son.  Several years later,
at the request of their
son, they had signed documents, the contents of which they were not shown, in
the belief that the documents
were a roll-over of the original loan.  In fact,
the son was close to bankruptcy and the documents increased the amount of the
loan.
<P>

309  	An appeal from Santow J's decision in <b>Burke</b> was
dismissed.  <b>State Bank of New South Wales v Burke</b> (unreported Court of
Appeal 4 April 1997).  The leading judgment in the Court of Appeal was
delivered by Priestley JA, with whom
the other members of the Court agreed.

<P>

310  	In his judgment in <b>Burke</b> Priestley JA considered an
argument by the appellant bank that the facts found by the trial judge "did not
support a finding of unconscionability
as explained in the leading case of
<b>Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v Amadio</b>".  At one stage in his
judgment Priestley JA said:-
<P>

"The bank obtained what was, in fact, an unfair advantage.  The only aspect
reasonably open to argument is whether the bank should
be regarded as having
had sufficient knowledge of that unfair advantage to make it a party to the
unconscionability.  
<P>

On this point Santow J analysed the relevant case law in some detail and came
to the conclusion that `the principle of constructive
notice should apply to
any situation where the surety reposes trust and ,confidence in the principal
debtor in relation to his financial
affairs (<b>Barclays Bank Pty Limited v
O'Brien</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20AC%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 AC 180</a> at 198 so long as the likelihood of that is or
should be known to the creditor, in circumstances where the transaction of
guarantee
was not to the guarantor's advantage.
<P>

I agree with this.  The cases justify a doctrine at least as wide as this (see
amongst many other places Mason J in <b>Amadio</b> at 467) and possibly wider,
although it is not necessary to consider the wider possibility in the present
case".
<P>

311  	<b>Barclays Bank v O'Brien</b>, insofar as it decided that
there was no basis for providing special protection in equity to wives in
relation to surety transactions,
was expressly not followed by the High Court
in <b>Garcia v National Australia Bank</b>.  In <b>Garcia</b> the High Court,
overruling the New South Wales Court of Appeal (<b>National Australia Bank v
Garcia</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 577)</a>, held that a married woman who became a surety
for her husband's debt could still rely on the special protection afforded to
married
women by the decision of the High Court in <b>Yerkey v Jones</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2063%20CLR%20649" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939)
63 CLR 649</a>, which did not depend upon the creditor having notice, at the time
the guarantee was taken, of some unconscionable dealing between
the husband as
borrower and the wife as surety.
<P>

312  	As regards <b>Barclays Bank v O'Brien</b> generally, Gaudron,
McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in their joint judgment said at par15:-
<P>

"Sheller JA, who gave the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal, considered
the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Barclays Bank PLC v O'Brien</i> and,
in several respects, found difficulty in accepting the reasoning therein.  The
New Zealand Court of Appeal has said that `the
jurisprudential basis of
<i>O'Brien</i> remains uncertain' (<i>Wilkinson v ASP Bank Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20NZLR%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1
NZLR 674</a> at 689).  After referring to the English authorities decided after
<i>O'Brien</i>, Sir Anthony Mason has suggested that `the plethora of cases may
suggest that all is not well with the <i>O'Brien</i> principle'.  It is
unnecessary for us to enter upon the matter, beyond noting that in
<i>O'Brien</i> the House of Lords discounted what it understood was the
`special equity theory' supported by Dixon J in <i>Yerkey v Jones".</i>
<P>

313  	In the Court of Appeal Sheller JA had said at 597:-
<P>

"I have some difficulty with the propositions Lord Browne-Wilkinson advanced...
which led him... to identify a number of other special
relationships, including
that of a son to his elderly parents, which would put a creditor accepting
security from the party assumed
to be the weaker, on enquiry".
<P>

314  	As I have already indicated, Kirby J in his judgment in
<b>Garcia</b> offered a "re-formulation" of the principles stated by Lord
Browne-Wilkinson in <b>O'Brien</b>, suggesting that Kirby J was not satisfied
with the principles as originally formulated.
<P>

315  	In his judgment in the High Court in <b>Garcia</b> Callinan J
said at par109:-
<P>

"I would not, with respect, adopt the principles settled by the House of Lords
in <b>Barclays Bank PLC v O'Brien</b>, that any exceptional rules formally
applicable to guarantees by wives of husbands' obligations should be extended
to co-habitees
in cases in which the creditor is aware of an emotional
relationship between the co-habitees".
<P>

316  	I have concluded that I should not apply the principles stated
by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <b>Barclays Bank v O'Brien, </b>except to the
extent to which they may be in accordance with the principles stated by the
High Court in <b>Amadio</b>.
<P>

317  	Nor do I consider that I should apply Kirby J's
"re-formulation" in his judgment in <b>Garcia</b> of the principles stated by
Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <b>O'Brien</b>.  At par73 Kirby J said:-
<P>

"I favour a re-formulation of the principle expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson
in <b>O'Brien</b>..  It is my view that the principle should be stated thus:
Where a person has entered into an obligation to stand as surety for the
debts
of another and the credit provider knows, or ought ot know, that there is a
relationship involving emotional dependence on
the part of the surety towards
the debtor: (1) the surety obligation will be valid and enforceable by the
credit provider unless
the suretyship was procured by the undue influence,
misrepresentation or other legal wrong of the principal debtor;  (2) if there
has been undue influence, misrepresentation or other legal wrong by the
principal debtor, unless the credit provider has taken reasonable
steps to
satisfy itself that the surety entered into the obligation freely and in
knowledge of the true facts, the credit provider
will be unable to enforce the
surety obligation because it will be fixed with notice of the surety's right to
set aside the transaction;
 (3) unless there are special exceptional
circumstances or the risks are large, a credit provider will have taken such
reasonable
steps to avoid being fixed with constructive notice if it warns the
surety (at a meeting not attended by the principal debtor) of
the amount of the
surety's potential liability, of the risks involved to the surety's own
interests and advises the surety to take
independent legal advice.  Out of
respect for economic freedom, the duty of the credit provider will be limited
to taking reasonable
steps only".
<P>

318  	What Kirby J said in this paragraph is explicitly a departure
from what was said by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <b>Barclays Bank v O'Brien</b>
and advanced by Kirby J for the first time and is not adverted to by any of the
other members of the High Court.
<P>

319  	I will now turn to the decision of the High Court in
<b>Amadio</b>.  The leading judgments in <b>Amadio</b> on the subject of
unconscionability were given by Mason J and Deane J.  Wilson J agreed with
Deane J.  Dawson J dissented and Gibbs
CJ , on this point, also dissented.
<P>

320  	At p474 Deane J said concerning the jurisdiction of courts of
equity to relieve against an unconscionable dealing:-
<P>

"The jurisdiction is long established as extending generally to circumstances
in which (i) a party to a transaction was under a
special disability in dealing
with the other party with the consequence that there was an absence of any
reasonable degree of equality
between them and (ii) that disability was
sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie unfair or
"unconscientious"
that he procure, or accept the weaker party's assent to the
impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he procured or accepted
it.
Where such circumstances are shown to have existed, an onus is cast upon the
stronger party to show that the transaction was
fair, just and reasonable".
<P>

321  	At p462 Mason J said:-
<P>

"...an underlying general principle which may be invoked whenever one party by
reason of some condition or circumstance is placed
at a special disadvantage
vis--vis another and unfair or unconscientious advantage is then taken of the
opportunity thereby created.
 I qualify the word `disadvantage' by the
adjective `special' in order to disavow any suggestion that the principle
applies whenever
there is some difference in the bargaining power of the
parties and in order to emphasize that the disabling condition or circumstance
is one which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a
judgment as to his own best interests, when the other
party knows or ought to
know of the existence of that condition or circumstance and of its effect on
the innocent party".
<P>

322  	Mason J was at pains to point out that this principle allowing
equitable relief on the ground of unconscionable conduct is
quite distinct from
the limited duty of disclosure owed by a creditor to an intending surety, which
I have dealt with earlier in
this judgment.  His Honour observed:-
<P>

"But the fact that a bank's duty to make disclosure to its intending surety,
arising from the mere relationship between principal
creditor and surety, is so
limited has no bearing on the availability of equitable relief on the ground of
unconscionable conduct.
 A bank, though not guilty of any breach of its limited
duty to make disclosure to the intending surety, may nonetheless be considered
to have engaged in unconscionable conduct in procuring the surety's entry into
the contract of guarantee".
<P>

323  	As to whether the stronger party knows or ought to know of the
existence of the special disability to which the other party
is subject, Mason
J said at 467:-
<P>

"As we have seen, if A having actual knowledge that B occupies a situation of
special disadvantage in relation to an intended transaction,
so that B cannot
make a judgment as to what is in his own interests, takes unfair advantage of
his (A's) superior bargaining power
or position by entering into that
transaction, his conduct in so doing is unconscionable.  And if, instead of
having actual knowledge
of that situation, A is aware of the possibility that
that situation may exist or is aware of facts that would raise that possibility
in the mind of any reasonable person, the result will be the same".
<P>

324  	The first question to determine is whether Mr Sullivan was
subject to a special disability or disadvantage in his dealing
with the Bank.

<P>

325  	Mr Sullivan was not subject to any disability of the types
often encountered in cases in which unconscionability is invoked.
 He was not
subject to any disability by reason of lack of intelligence, lack of knowledge
of the English language, illiteracy, sickness
or lack of any business
experience.  I have also found that, although he was sixty-seven years old at
the time he entered into the
mortgage, he was not subject to any disability by
reason of his age.  Although Mr Sullivan had not had much formal education,
this
lack of formal education did not disadvantage him.  Moreover, as I have
found, Mr Sullivan had previously entered into numerous mortgages,
understood
the nature of a mortgage and understood the standard features of a mortgage,
including that money secured by the mortgage
must be paid to the lender and
that in the event of default the mortgagee can take possession of, and sell,
the mortgaged land. 

<P>

326  	However, as Deane J said in <b>Amadio</b> the circumstances
which may constitute a special disability may take a wide variety of forms and
are not susceptible to being comprehensively
catalogued.  In his judgment in
<b>Amadio</b> Deane J referred to some examples of a special disability given
by Fullagar J in <b>Blomley v Ryan</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 362</a> at 405, which included
"lack of assistance or explanation, where assistance or explanation is
necessary".  Lack of information about
a transaction and misinformation about a
transaction can place a party to the transaction in a position of special
disadvantage.
<P>

327  	In the present case, I find that Mr Sullivan, by reason of lack
of information and misinformation about the transaction, was
in a position of
special disability  or special disadvantage in his dealing with the Bank.
<P>

328  	Nobsa, the company whose indebtedness to the Bank Mr Sullivan
was to guarantee and secure, was in serious financial difficulties,
as was well
known to the Bank but was unknown to Mr Sullivan.  So far as Mr Sullivan was
aware, Nobsa appeared to be doing good business
and to be prospering.  Mr
Sullivan was not told by anyone how much Nobsa owed the Bank.  Mr Sullivan was
not shown financial documents
of Nobsa by either Craig Kelly or by Nobsa's
accountant, Mr Weidenhofer.  Neither Craig Kelly or Mr Weidenhofer explained
Nobsa's
financial position to Mr Sullivan.  Mr Sullivan had been told by Mr
Weidenhofer that he would have no problems or worries, if he
entered into the
mortgage.  Nobsa's serious financial difficulties were exacerbated by the
failure to sell Craig Kelly's property
at the auction on 13 October 1990.
<P>

329  	Because of Nobsa's serious financial difficulties, the Bank,
unknown to Mr Sullivan, was seriously contemplating enforcing
securities it
held for Nobsa's debt.  I do not fully accept a submission made on behalf of Mr
Sullivan that the Bank, before Mr Sullivan
entered into the mortgage, had
already decided that it would commence the process of enforcing securities it
held for Nobsa's indebtedness,
on the day after Mr Sullivan was to give the
mortgage over the land, "if the indebtedness (of Nobsa) to the Bank was not
greatly
reduced".  As I have already indicated, the decision made by the Bank's
Regional Lending Manager on 22 October 1990 was that, if
Nobsa's debt had not
been reduced to $250,000 by 15 November 1990, the Branch Manager should submit
the mortgage on Mr Kelly's property
for call-up.  As at 22 October and as at
the time Mr Sullivan entered into the mortgage, Nobsa's indebtedness did not
greatly exceed
$250,000 and the Bank anticipated, in the event correctly, that
Nobsa's indebtedness would be reduced to or below $250,000 by 15
November 1990,
by the injection of funds from Marjory Craig.  However, although the
commencement of recovery procedures as early
as 15 November 1990 was unlikely,
and did not in fact happen, the Bank knew, and Mr Sullivan did not know, that
there was a very
real likelihood that the Bank would take steps to enforce
whatever securities it held for Nobsa's indebtedness, including the mortgage
to
be given by Mr Sullivan, soon afterwards.  The Bank had concluded that Nobsa's
business was "not performing" and that its capacity
to service its loan was
"non-existent".  The only other security the Bank held for Nobsa's indebtedness
(apart, possibly, from an
equitable security over Nobsa's assets which was of
little value) was the mortgage over Craig Kelly's property.  The mortgage over
Craig Kelly's property also secured Craig Kelly's personal indebtedness to the
Bank.  Craig Kelly's personal indebtedness was substantial
and was not being
serviced and difficulties were being experienced in selling Craig Kelly's
property.  Mr Sullivan knew that Craig
Kelly owed money to the Bank but he did
not know how much.
<P>

330  	Mr Sullivan also believed, as a result of what he had been told
by Craig Kelly, that as soon as Craig Kelly's house had been
sold, which Mr
Sullivan was led to believe would happen within a couple of months or at least
within a few months, the mortgage over
Mr Sullivan's property would be
discharged, whereas the true position was that, even after a sale of Craig
Kelly's property, the
Bank would continue to require a mortgage over Mr
Sullivan's land.
<P>

331  	It was submitted on behalf of the Bank that it had not been
shown that what Craig Kelly said to Mr Sullivan, if it was said,
was a
misrepresentation in the strict sense, in that it consisted of assertions as to
the future and the limited circumstances in
which assertions as to the future
can constitute misrepresentations were not established.  I do not consider that
Craig Kelly had
grounds for believing that a mortgage from Mr Sullivan would be
required for only a few months but I would not find that Craig Kelly
was
knowingly fraudulent.  However, even if what Craig Kelly said did not amount to
an actionable misrepresentation by him, it nevertheless
contributed to Mr
Sullivan misapprehending the onerousness to him of the transaction he was
entering.
<P>

332  	Counsel for the Bank also submitted that Mr Sullivan was
misinformed about the transaction he was entering into, as a result
of what he
had been told by Mr Lyons at the meeting at the Bank.  However, I have already
found that Mr Lyons did not at the meeting
at the Bank make any
misrepresentation on which Mr Sullivan relied in deciding to enter into the
mortgage.
<P>

333  	The next question to determine is whether the Bank knew or
ought to have known of the existence of the matters giving rise
to the special
disability to which Mr Sullivan was subject, or whether the special disability
was "sufficiently evident" to the Bank
so as to make it prima facie
unconscientious for the Bank to procure or accept Mr Sullivan's assent to the
transaction.  I will proceed
on the basis that these two formulations are
substantially equivalent.
<P>

334  	The Bank did not know, nor ought it to have known, that Craig
Kelly had told Mr Sullivan that his mortgage would be required
only for a short
time until Craig Kelly's property had been sold or that Mr Weidenhofer had told
Mr Sullivan that he would have "no
worries", if he entered into the
mortgage.
<P>

335  	A key question is whether the Bank knew or ought to have known,
or whether it would have been sufficiently evident to the
Bank, that Mr
Sullivan was not informed or misinformed about the financial position of Nobsa
and the gravity of the risk he was incurring
by giving a guarantee and a
mortgage to secure  Nobsa's indebtedness.  I consider that this question should
be answered in the affirmative.
<P>

336  	The Bank had actual knowledge that Mr Sullivan was an intending
guarantor, who would not be benefiting personally from the
proposed
transaction, that he was a retired pensioner living in Queensland and that he
had not been a shareholder and had not held
any position in Nobsa and was not
to become a shareholder in Nobsa.  It would have been evident to the Bank that,
unless Mr Sullivan
received reliable information, he would be unlikely to be
able to make a judgment as to his own best interests.  Possible sources
of
information for Mr Sullivan were the Bank itself, the continuing principal of
Nobsa Mr Sullivan's "step-son" Craig Kelly or a
professional adviser, such as a
solicitor or accountant.  
<P>

337  	As far as the Bank itself was concerned, I have found that Mr
Lyons did not tell Mr Sullivan the amount of Nobsa's indebtedness
and I am
satisfied that Mr Lyons did not supply information about Nobsa's financial
position to Mr Sullivan.  The Bank is to be regarded
as knowing that it itself
had not supplied information about the financial position of Nobsa to Mr
Sullivan
<P>

338  	As regards Craig Kelly, I consider that it would have been
evident to the Bank that Mr Sullivan trusted Craig Kelly, that
Craig Kelly was
not taking a realistic view of Nobsa's finances or his own personal finances
and, to the extent to which he supplied
information to Mr Sullivan, that
information would be likely to be unduly optimistic.  On 1 August 1990 a
proposal had been made
by Nobsa that the Bank provide Nobsa with accommodation
totalling $2.5m to enable the purchase of another restaurant and reception
lounge and the re-financing of the existing debts of Nobsa.  The Bank obviously
regarded this proposal as quite unrealistic, given
Nobsa's financial state.  On
13 October 1990 Mr Kelly's property had not been sold at auction.  As the Bank
knew, Mr Kelly was unwilling
to reduce the asking price, even though the
highest bid at the auction had been more than $100,000 less than the asking
price. 
<P>

339  	The Bank knew that the only solicitor acting (apart from the
Bank's own solicitors) was Mr Williams, that Mr Williams was
also acting for
Nobsa and Craig Kelly and that Mr Williams had acted for Nobsa and Craig Kelly
in the past.  It would have been evident
to the Bank that Mr Williams would be
unlikely to give information or advice to Mr Sullivan, which was not in the
interests of his
established clients Nobsa and Craig Kelly, for whom it was
important that the transaction should proceed.  The matters certified
to by Mr
Williams in his certificate of witness would have given no ground for inferring
that Mr Williams had explained the financial
position of Nobsa to Mr Sullivan.

<P>

340  	The Bank knew that Mr Weidenhofer was Nobsa's accountant and
Craig Kelly's personal accountant.  Mr Weidenhofer had participated
in the
unrealistic proposal for further accommodation of 1 August 1990.  The Bank's
Branch Manager's faith in Mr Weidenhofer had
been weakened, when Mr Weidenhofer
at a first meeting had asserted that Nobsa could meet its own financial
repayments on its own,
an assertion which the manager regarded as groundless
and contradicted by Nobsa's actual past performance.  It would have been
evident
to the Bank that Mr Weidenhofer would be unlikely to have given
accurate information about Nobsa to Mr Sullivan.
<P>

341  	Mr Weidenhofer had prepared the accounts of Nobsa for the year
ended 30 June 1990.  In their final form these accounts showed
a deficiency in
both shareholders' funds and working capital and showed a worse position than
in the earlier draft accounts.  However,
the true position of Nobsa was much
worse than appeared on the surface of either the draft or the final accounts,
because these accounts
showed as assets of Nobsa "loans to directors or
persons/entities associated with directors" and "intangibles", which would have
little realisable value.  In preparing a statement of the financial position of
Nobsa for the purposes of the application, Mr Lyons
eliminated these assets
shown in the balance sheet prepared by Mr Weidenhofer.  However, it would have
been evident to the Bank that
a person such as Mr Sullivan, even if he had been
shown the accounts, would have been unlikely to have had the accounting
knowledge
to make these adjustments.
<P>

342  	The very gravity of the risk Mr Sullivan was incurring, the
relationship between him and Craig Kelly's mother and Craig Kelly
himself which
could have provided a non-commercial reason for Mr Sullivan agreeing to enter
into the transaction, and the haste which
Mr Williams requested in his letter
of 18 October 1990 to the Bank's solicitors were all factors known to the Bank,
which would tend
to suggest that Mr Sullivan might not be properly informed
about the financial state of Nobsa and the risk he was running by entering
into
the transaction.
<P>

343  	I have found that the Bank knew or ought to have known (or it
would have been evident to the Bank) that Mr Sullivan was not
informed about
the serious financial state of Nobsa, including the amount of its indebtedness
to the Bank and the gravity of the
risk he was incurring by giving a guarantee
and a mortgage to secure Nobsa's indebtedness.  Furthermore, the Bank would
have known
that Mr Sullivan was unaware of the serious attitude the Bank took
to Nobsa's indebtedness and of the real likelihood that the Bank
would be
seeking to enforce any security Mr Sullivan gave.  Mr Sullivan's lack of
information on these matters, even without his
misapprehension induced by Craig
Kelly's misrepresentation that the mortgage would only be a temporary mortgage
until Craig Kelly's
house was sold, constituted a lack of information about the
proposed transaction such as to amount to a special disability or special
disadvantage, so as to make it prima facie unconscientious for the Bank to
procure or accept Mr Sullivan's assent to the transaction.
 If Mr Sullivan had
known of Nobsa's true financial position including the amount Nobsa owed the
Bank and the attitude taken by the
Bank to Nobsa's indebtedness and the
likelihood that the Bank would be seeking to enforce any mortgage given by Mr
Sullivan, then
he would not have entered into the mortgage.
<P>

344  	I consider that the transaction has not been shown to have been
fair, just and reasonable.  Mr Sullivan did not derive any
personal benefit
from the transaction.  The property mortgaged was his home and his only
substantial asset.  By entering into the
mortgage, he incurred, without his
knowledge, the imminent risk of losing his home.
<P>

345  	Under the principles in <b>Amadio</b> the mortgage is not
binding on Mr Sullivan.  It was suggested in argument that, if the mortgage was
found not to be fully binding,
a distinction should be drawn between its
enforceability as a security and its enforceabilty as giving rise to a personal
debt. 
However, I do not consider that Mr Sullivan's misapprehension was
limited to a misapprehension about the remedies open to the mortgagee
under the
mortgage and I see no basis for drawing the distinction suggested.  There
should be judgment for Mr Sullivan on the Bank's
claims against him for
possession of the land and for judgment for the amount alleged to be due under
the mortgage.
<P>

<b>Cross-claim: Sullivan v Williams</b>
<P>

346  	I have held that under the principles relating to
unconscionable dealings stated in <b>Amadio</b> the mortgage is not binding on
Mr Sullivan.  It is, accordingly, not strictly necessary for me to consider Mr
Sullivan's cross-claim
against Mr Williams, which would only need to be
considered if Mr Sullivan had suffered loss as a result of the Bank succeeding
in
its claim against him.  It is, however, desirable that I should consider Mr
Sullivan's cross-claim against Mr Williams and make findings
in relation to
this cross-claim, in case I am wrong in finding for Mr Sullivan in the
proceedings between him and the Bank and also
because some findings will be
relevant to the other cross-claim, which I will have to consider, being that
brought by the Bank against
Mr Williams.  It is an essential ingredient of the
cross-claim brought by the Bank against Mr Williams that Mr Williams did not
act
carefully in carrying out the duties he owed to Mr Sullivan.
<P>

347  	The cross-claim brought by Mr Sullivan against Mr Williams
pleaded a cause of action in the tort of negligence.  It was alleged
in the
cross-claim that Mr Williams owed a duty of care to Mr Sullivan, that he
committed breaches of that duty of care and that
thereby Mr Sullivan was caused
loss and damage.  In the cross-claim a large number of particulars of
negligence were alleged but
ultimately many of these were not pressed.  In the
final written submissions of counsel for Mr Sullivan it was submitted that Mr
Williams had committed a number of specific breaches and it will be necessary
for me to deal only with these alleged breaches.
<P>

348  	There is no doubt that Mr Williams was retained to act as
solicitor for Mr Sullivan in relation to the mortgage.  In his letter
of 18
October 1990 to the Bank's solicitors Mr Williams said that he acted for, among
others, Mr Sullivan in relation to a mortgage
from Mr Sullivan to the Bank of
the land in Queensland.  Mr Williams' office communicated by telephone and
letter with Queensland
solicitors, asking them to act as agents for Mr
Williams' firm in obtaining information about the land and identifying the
client
as Mr Sullivan.  On 14 November 1990 Mr Sullivan attended at Mr
Williams' office and Mr Williams procured Mr Sullivan's execution
of the
mortgage.  However, the fact that Mr Williams was retained to act as solicitor
for Mr Sullivan does not determine the important
question of the content or
extent of the retainer.
<P>

349  	There is little express evidence about the extent of the
retainer of Mr Williams by Mr Sullivan.  Mr Sullivan had attended
the meeting
at the Bank in September 1990 and by this stage had agreed to mortgage the
land.  By its letter of 2 October 1990 the
Bank had notified Craig Kelly that
approval had been given by the Bank to the substitution of the mortgage over Mr
Sullivan's land
for the mortgage over Mr Ahmet's property.  Craig Kelly then
gave instructions to Mr Williams on behalf of Nobsa, himself, his mother
and Mr
Sullivan.  There was no direct communication between Mr Sullivan and Mr
Williams.  In his letter of 18 October 1990 to the
Bank's solicitors Mr
Williams simply said, so far as is relevant, that he was acting for Mr Sullivan
in relation to the matter of
the mortgage from Mr Sullivan to the Bank.  By
their letter of 26 October 1990 the solicitors acting for the Bank forwarded
the draft
documents, including the mortgage, and requested that the documents
be executed and returned.  
<P>

350  	On 14 November 1990 Mr Sullivan attended at Mr Williams'
office.  I have found that at the meeting Mr Williams followed his
usual
practice in advising Mr Sullivan as a proposed guarantor and a proposed third
party mortgagor.  At the meeting Mr Sullivan
signed the mortgage, the
acknowledgment and consent of third party mortgagor and the notice regarding
execution of documents.  Mr
Williams signed the certificate of witness.  There
is no evidence of anything being said at the meeting about the financial wisdom
or prudence of Mr Sullivan giving the mortgage.  
<P>

351  	In my opinion, Mr Williams' retainer, so far as Mr Sullivan was
concerned, was to ensure that Mr Sullivan understood the nature
and effect of
the mortgage as a legal document and the consequences for Mr Sullivan if there
was default, to ensure that all things
were done which were required to be done
in order for Mr Williams properly to complete the certificate of witness and to
ensure that
the mortgage and all other documents were properly executed so as
to give full effect to the proposed transaction.  
<P>

352  	In short, I am of the opinion that the retainer was similar to
the retainer in <b>Clark Boyce v Mouat</b> (1994) 1 AC 428, which the Privy
Council held (at 437) was a retainer to the solicitor "that he should carry out
the necessary conveyancing
on her (the client's) behalf and explain to her the
legal implications of the transaction".
<P>

353  	The question of whether a solicitor has any wider obligation to
a client than to exercise reasonable care in doing what he
has been retained to
do was discussed by Sheller JA, with whose judgment the other members of the
Court agreed, in <b>Citicorp Australia Ltd v O'Brien </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 398</a> at
412-413.  Sheller JA said:-
<P>

"Bryson J quoted from <i>Hogan v Howard Finance Ltd</i> [1987] ASC55-594 at
57,539, where Hope JA said: `A solicitor is not responsible for advising a
client about his investments except
to the extent that he is retained to carry
out that task.'  In <i>Hawkins v Clayton</i> (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 574, Deane J
said that the emergence and development of the modern law of negligence,
particularly since the
decision in <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp;
Partners Ltd </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 465</a>, inevitably led to a re-appraisal of the
isolation of a solicitor from the reach of the ordinary law of negligence in
relation to
his professional dealings with a client.  `The clear trend of
modern authority is to support the approach that the duty of care owed
by a
solicitor to a client in respect of professional work prima facie transcends
that contained in the express or implied terms
of the contract between them and
includes the ordinary duty of care arising under the common law of
negligence'.
<P>

In <i>Cousins v Cousins </i>(Court of Appeal 18 December 1990, unreported),
Priestley JA said (at 12):
<P>

`Whether it is yet possible to express in general terms the duty that arises at
common law from the relationship, as distinct from
the contract, between client
and solicitor, is not clear.  Deane J in <i>Hawkins</i> stated the position in
terms of a general rule, but neither Brennan J nor Gaudron J, the other members
of the majority, (Mason CJ
and Wilson J having dissented) appear to have fully
agreed with him.  Brennan J stated the specific duty that arose on the
circumstances
of that case, without stating the position for solicitors
generally.'
<P>

His Honour referred to <i>Waimond Pty Ltd v Byrne</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 642</a>, for
the proposition that this Court has not yet committed itself to adoption of the
views of Deane J.  Priestley JA continued (at
130:
<P>

`Notwithstanding that the view of Deane J was not in a formal sense part of the
ratio decidendi of <i>Hawkins</i>, it seems to me to be very much in accordance
with the trend of development in the law of negligence in the High Court in
recent
years, and I will assume for the purposes of the present case that it
accurately states the law of Australia.  What Deane J said
was:
<P>

`The relationship of solicitor and client is ... a relationship of proximity
which ordinarily involves the combination of those
elements with respect to
foreseeable loss which may be caused to the client by the performance of
professional work.  It is a relationship
of proximity of a kind which may well
give rise to a duty of care on the part of the solicitor which requires the
taking of positive
steps, beyond the specifically agreed professional task or
function, to avoid a real and foreseeable risk of economic loss being
sustained
by the client.  Whether the solicitor-client relationship does give rise to a
duty of care requiring the taking of such
positive steps will depend upon the
nature of the particular professional task or function which is involved in the
circumstances
of the case' (at 579).
<P>

The sentence particularly relevant here is that stating that there may be
proximity `which may well give rise to a duty of care'
requiring the solicitor
to do something more beyond what he has been specifically retained to do.
Deane J was contemplating both
that some cases would and other cases would not
require a solicitor to do more than he was specifically retained to do."
<P>

354  	In <b>Waimond Pty Limited v Byrne</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 642</a> the
majority of the Court of Appeal held that in the particular circumstances of
the case a solicitor was liable to a client for
omitting to give advice to the
client on a matter which was not within the solicitor's retainer.  Kirby P said
at 652:-
<P>

"Although the contract of retainer will be an important indicium of the nature
of the relationship which gives rise to the common
law duty of care (as the
minority held in <i>Hawkins</i>) it will not chart exclusively the perimeters
of that duty".
<P>

355  	It seems to me that I should seek to apply what Deane J said in
<b>Hawkins</b>.
<P>

356  	In this case Mr Sullivan's legal advisers obtained a written
opinion from Mr Neville Moses, an eminent solicitor with special
expertise in
conveyancing.  The report was admitted into evidence over objection by counsel
for Mr Williams and Mr Moses also gave
brief oral evidence.  Counsel for Mr
Williams referred inter alia to <b>Permanent Trustee Australia Limited v

157 ALR 30 (Federal</a> Court).
<P>

357  	The effect of Pt33 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act </i>1995</a>, and
especially <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s80(a)</a> which provides that evidence is not inadmissible only because
it is about a fact in issue or an ultimate issue, has not yet been
fully
explored.  In my opinion, Mr Moses' evidence was admissible as coming within
proposition (d) stated by Young J in <b>Permanent Trustee Australia</b>, namely
"to admit (into evidence), subject to relevance, evidence as to what is common
practice among solicitors of good repute".
<P>

358  	In his report Mr Moses expressed opinions about what would have
been "usual" or "standard" conveyancing practice at the time
the mortgage was
entered into.
<P>

359  	Inter alia Mr Moses expressed the opinion that it would have
been usual conveyancing practice for a solicitor to have discussed
the proposed
transaction with Mr Sullivan separately without his other clients being
present.  Mr Moses considered that in any such
discussion with Mr Sullivan it
would have become apparent to his solicitor that Mr Sullivan was to give a
third party mortgage, that
Mr Sullivan had no interest in Nobsa and was not to
receive any consideration for giving the mortgage, that (depending on its
interpretation)
the mortgage could secure further advances by the Bank as well
as Nobsa's existing indebtedness and impose a personal liability on
Mr
Sullivan.  Mr Moses also took into account that Mr Williams had received a
balance sheet of Nobsa, showing a deficiency in shareholders'
equity.  Mr Moses
then said:-
<P>

"In all of these circumstances the writer considers that it would have been
standard practice for the solicitor to have advised
Mr Sullivan firstly that he
should obtain independent financial advice as to the viability or otherwise of
the company and second
to seek to have an independent solicitor act for him,
not merely to explain the Mortgage document but also to advise on the ways
in
which Mr Sullivan's interests could be better protected should he decide to go
ahead with the transaction after considering the
independent financial
advice".
<P>

360  	A little later in his report Mr Moses said:-
<P>

"If Mr Sullivan had refused to seek independent advice and had insisted that
the Solicitor merely explain the Mortgage document
and the consequences of
entering into it, the Solicitor would then have had to consider whether he
could act merely for this limited
purpose".
<P>

361  	After discussing certain matters Mr Moses said:-
<P>

"However, the writer does not feel that it was outside the bounds of usual
practice for the Solicitor in 1990 to provide a certificate
of independent
explanation in these circumstances provided:-
<P>

1.	The earlier advice about seeking independent financial and legal advice had
been given and that notwithstanding this the client
had insisted that he did
not wish to do so and that he wanted to have the documents explained by the
Solicitor and no-one else.
<P>

2.	The Solicitor had pointed out the limited nature of his retainer and the
fact that if any future conflict of interest arose between
Mr Sullivan and the
Kellys or the Company the Solicitor would not be able to represent Mr
Sullivan.
<P>

3.	The Solicitor fully and promptly explained the terms of the Mortgage and the
consequences for Mr Sullivan if Nobsa defaulted
on its obligations".
<P>

362  	As to the last matter, Mr Moses expressed the opinion that, if
Mr Williams had given an explanation to Mr Sullivan in accordance
with what Mr
Williams said was his usual practice, "this would generally (although subject
to some qualification) be a satisfactory
explanation of a third party mortgage
or guarantee".  However, "if Mr Sullivan's affidavit is accepted, the
solicitor's explanation
of the mortgage documents fell far short of that which
would be expected if the mortgage documents had been properly and fully
explained".
<P>

363  	Counsel for Mr Williams submitted that Mr Moses' evidence
should be given little weight.  Evidence that a defendant failed
to adopt a
common practice in his profession or occupation may indicate a want of care
"because it suggests at once that the defendant
did not do what others
considered proper and there is no problem of feasibility" (Fleming <b>The Law
of Torts</b> (8th Ed) at 120)  Nevertheless, it is for the Court to determine
whether a defendant has been negligent and evidence that the defendant
did, or
did not, comply with what a person qualified to express an opinion says was
common practice at the time is only a factor
in determining the question.
<P>

364  	A general question which arose at the hearing was, if I found
that Mr Williams had been negligent in omitting to give some
advice or to take
some other step, how I should proceed in determining whether there was a causal
connection between Mr Williams'
negligent omission and Mr Sullivan's entering
into the mortgage.
<P>

365  	Mr Sullivan was not asked any question, and did not give any
evidence, about whether if he had received advice from Mr Williams
on some
matter on which he was not advised, he would have acted any differently.  Such
direct evidence by Mr Sullivan would have
been admissible but is not essential
to the drawing of an inference of a causal connection between Mr Williams'
negligent omission
and Mr Sullivan's entering into the mortgage.  <b>Dominelli
Ford (Hurstville) Pty Limited v Kermot Auto Spares Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/550.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 550</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2038%20FCR%20471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 38
FCR 471</a> especially at 481-2.
<P>

366  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that "it is not
relevant to speculate on what course would have been taken, if there
had been
full disclosure (or full advice)".  However, this submission is not supported
by the authority cited <b>Clark v Barter</b> (unreported Court of Appeal 23
December 1988 at p14), where Clarke JA (relying on <b>Nocton v Lord
Ashburton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281914%29%20AC%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1914) AC 632)</a> said:-
<P>

"In this situation (a breach of fiduciary duty by a solicitor) equity gives a
remedy for a loss suffered.  Once the court determines
that the non-disclosed
facts are material, it is not relevant to speculate on what course would have
been followed if there had been
full disclosure".
<P>

367  	The present case is a case at common law for alleged negligence
and not a case in equity for alleged non-disclosure by a fiduciary.
 
<P>

368  	It was also submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that a
presumption of a causal connection would arise between any proved breach
of
duty by Mr Williams and Mr Sullivan entering into a mortgage and thereby
incurring loss.  Counsel referred inter alia to <b>Gould v Vaggelas</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985)

especially at 263-266.
<P>

369  	In <b>Gould v Vaggelas</b> Wilson J stated at 236:-
<P>

"1.	Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the
representee does not rely upon it he has no case.
<P>

2.	If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the
representee to enter into a contract and that person in
fact enters into the
contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by
the representation.
<P>

3.	The <i>inference may be rebutted</i>, for example, by showing that the
representee, before he entered into a contract, either was possessed of actual
knowledge of the
true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it
plain that whether he knew the true facts or not he did not rely on
the
representation.
<P>

4.	The representation need not be the sole inducement.  It is sufficient so
long as it plays some part, even if only a minor part,
in contributing to the
formation of the contract".
<P>

370  	In <b>Dominelli Ford</b> the Full Court of the Federal Court
held that an intention to mislead on the part of the representor was not
essential for the operation
of the principles stated by Wilson J in <b>Gould v
Vaggelas</b>.
<P>

371  	I would accordingly accept that when a representation is made
(whether or not it is fraudulent), the representation is of
such a kind as to
be likely to induce the representee to enter into a contract and the
representee does enter into the contract,
then an inference, which is only an
inference of fact, arises that the representee was induced to enter into the
contract by the
false representation.  However, I do not accept that the
principles stated by Wilson J in <b>Gould v Vaggelas</b> can be applied, or
adapted, to the case of negligent omission by a solicitor.  In the case of a
negligent omission by a solicitor
the onus is on the client to prove a causal
connection between the solicitor's negligent omission and any loss or damage
suffered
by the client.  The onus is on the client to prove that, if the advice
negligently omitted had been given, he would have acted differently.
<P>

372  	For example, in <b>Citicorp Australia</b> Sheller JA said at
418:-
<P>

"Moreover, in order to make such a case in negligence, the O'Briens were bound
to prove that, if Mr Eliades had advised them for
the reasons suggested not to
go on with the contract for purchase or finance, they would have acted on that
advice.  They gave no
such evidence and in my opinion it was not open to his
Honour to infer in the absence of any such evidence that the O'Briens would
have taken some course, other than the course they did in fact take".
<P>

373  	In <b>Fitzpatrick v Parker</b> (1996) 7 BPR 15,122, where the
plaintiff claimed that the defendant, his solicitor, had negligently failed to
advise him to take
out insurance on a property he had acquired, Priestley JA,
who delivered the leading judgment, said at p15124:-
<P>

"It was necessary for the trial judge to ask what on the probabilities would
have happened, had the proper advice been given".
<P>

374  	Priestley JA concluded, on the evidence in the particular case,
"that had the proper advice been given, then insurance would
have been obtained
and the damage which the plaintiff suffered from the want of insurance would
not have occurred".
<P>

375  	It was submitted by counsel for Mr Sullivan that Mr Williams
should not have acted for Mr Sullivan at all.  It was pointed
out that Mr
Williams acted, not only for Mr Sullivan, but also for Nobsa, Craig Kelly and
Marjory Craig.  Mr Williams took his instructions
for all his clients from
Craig Kelly (or Mr Weidenhofer).  Nobsa and Craig Kelly were clients for whom
Mr Williams had acted previously
on a number of occasions.  There was conflict
between the interests of Mr Sullivan and the interests of Mr Williams' other
clients.
 For example, it was in the interests of Nobsa and Craig Kelly that
the substitution of securities and the withdrawal of Mr Ahmet
from Nobsa take
place as a matter of urgency.  However, if Mr Williams in the interests of Mr
Sullivan had advised Mr Sullivan that
he should obtain independent advice, that
would have been likely to have delayed the transaction.
<P>

376  	It was submitted by counsel for Mr Sullivan that in these
circumstances Mr Williams should not have acted for Mr Sullivan,
at least not
without first taking steps which he had omitted to take.
<P>

377  	In support of this submission, counsel for Mr Sullivan referred
to parts of Mr Moses' report which I have already summarised,
in which Mr Moses
expressed opinions about the conditions which would have to be satisfied before
it would have been within the bounds
of usual practice for a solicitor to
provide "a certificate of independent explanation".
<P>

378  	In <b>Citicorp Australia</b> Sheller JA said at p412 that
certain passages in the judgment of the Privy Council given by Lord Jauncey of
Tullichettle in <b>Clark Boyce v Mouat</b> correctly stated the position where
a solicitor acts or proposes to act for more than one party in a transaction.
In <b>Clark Boyce v Mouat </b>Lord Jauncey said in passages quoted by Sheller
JA in <b>Citicorp Australia</b>:-
<P>

"There is no general rule of law to the effect that a solicitor should never
act for both parties in a transaction where their interests
may conflict.
Rather is the position that he may act provided that he has obtained the
informed consent of both to his acting.  Informed
consent means consent given
in the knowledge that there is a conflict between the parties and that as a
result the solicitor may
be disabled from disclosing to each party the full
knowledge which he possesses as to the transaction or may be disabled from
giving
advice to one party which conflicts with the interests of the other.  If
the parties are content to proceed upon this basis the solicitor
may properly
act".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>

In determining whether a solicitor has obtained informed consent to acting for
parties with conflicting interests it is essential
to determine precisely what
services are required of him by the parties".
<P>

379  	In my opinion, Mr Moses' evidence about what he said was the
standard practice of solicitors, puts that practice at a higher
level than is
required by <b>Clark Boyce v Mouat </b>and <b>Citicorp Australia</b> and I
should follow those authorities.
<P>

380  	In <b>Clark Boyce v Mouat, </b>as I have already stated, the
retainer to the solicitor was "that he should carry out the necessary
conveyancing on her (the client's)
behalf and explain to her the legal
implications of the transaction". 
<P>

381  	In the present case I have found that Mr Williams' retainer, so
far as Mr Sullivan was concerned, was to ensure that Mr Sullivan
understood the
nature and effect of the mortgage as a legal document and the consequences for
Mr Sullivan if there was default, to
ensure that all things were done which
were required to be done in order for Mr Williams properly to complete the
certificate of
witness and to ensure that the mortgage and all other documents
were properly executed so as to give full effect to the proposed
transaction.
The retainer was similar to the solicitor's retainer in both <b>Clark Boyce v
Mouat</b> and <b>Citicorp Australia.</b>
<P>

382  	Mr Williams' retainer being so limited, there was only a
limited area in which there was a possible conflict of interest between
Mr
Sullivan and Mr Williams' other clients but nevertheless there was a possible
conflict of interest.  Mr Williams did not obtain
the informed consent of Mr
Sullivan, as required by <b>Clark Boyce v Mouat</b>, and ought not to have
acted for Mr Sullivan, without having first obtained his informed consent.  On
the other hand, if Mr Williams
had advised that there could be a conflict
between Mr Sullivan's interests and the interests of Mr Williams' other clients
and that
Mr Williams might be disabled from disclosing the full knowledge he
possessed of the transaction or from giving advice to Mr Sullivan
which
conflicted with the interests of Mr Williams' other clients, then I do not
consider that it has been established that Mr Sullivan
would have done anything
other than to ask Mr Williams to continue acting for him.  I find affirmatively
that if Mr Williams had
given Mr Sullivan advice of the kind required by
<b>Clark Boyce v Mouat</b> and <b>Citicorp Australia Ltd</b>, Mr Sullivan would
have instructed Mr Williams to continue acting for him.  By the time of the
meeting at Mr Williams' office Mr
Sullivan had made up his mind to enter into
the mortgage.  Mr Sullivan trusted Craig Kelly and his mother, both of whom he
regarded
as being experienced in the restaurant business and "great workers".
Mr Sullivan trusted Mr Williams, who he had seen at the restaurant.
 Mr
Sullivan was well aware that Mr Williams was also acting for Craig Kelly, Nobsa
and Marjory Craig.
<P>

383  	It was also submitted by counsel for Mr Sullivan that as Mr
Williams was acting for more than one party, he was under an obligation
to
disclose all material facts known to him and that he had failed to discharge
this obligation.  It was submitted that he had not
disclosed all material facts
known to him, because he had not disclosed to Mr Sullivan the final accounts of
Nobsa, a copy of which
he had received, and information he had received that
both Nobsa and Craig Kelly had income tax liabilities.
<P>

384  	I do not consider that the submission that Mr Williams was
under an obligation to disclose all material facts known to him
should be
accepted.
<P>

385  	In support of the submission that Mr Williams was under such an
obligation counsel for Mr Sullivan cited <b>Clark v Barter</b> and especially
parts of the judgment of Clarke JA, which at first sight would appear to
support the submission.
<P>

386  	At p11 Clarke JA said:-
<P>

"When a solicitor undertakes to act for two or more parties in the one
transaction his duty of disclosure is not, in general, limited
to the
disclosure that he is acting for the other parties.  While the extent of his
obligation to disclose and advise will depend
to a degree on the terms of his
retainer, if that is not clearly limited his duty will require disclosure of
all those facts within
his knowledge which are relevant to the client's
consideration of the transaction.
<P>

So much is, I think, clear from Moody, (<b>Moody v Cox &amp; Hatt </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281917%29%202%20Ch%2071" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1917) 2
Ch. 71)</a>, which, like the present case, involved a purchase by a client from the
solicitor as trustee of trust property."
<P>

387  	Later in his judgment Clarke JA said:-
<P>

"This case (<b>Moody</b>) stands, in my opinion, as authority for the
proposition that the duty to disclose all material facts is not limited to
cases in
which the solicitor seeks to deal with his client.  It extends also to
cases in which a solicitor seeks to act for more than one
party involved in a
transaction".
<P>

388  	However, in <b>Clark v Barter</b> the claim against the
solicitor was based on an alleged breach by the solicitor of his equitable duty
as a fiduciary, so that it
was appropriate to refer to the solicitor's
obligations as a fiduciary, whereas in the present case the claim against the
solicitor
is based solely in tort.  Furthermore, as Clarke JA accepted, the
extent of the solicitor's duty to advise and disclose will depend
(at least to
a degree) on the terms of his retainer.  In <b>Clark v Barter</b> the
solicitor, in reliance on what he said were the terms of his retainer, denied
that he was subject to such a wide duty of disclosure.
 The solicitor contended
that "he was retained simply to prepare the mortgage and have it executed.
They (the clients) had already
decided to provide the security and it was no
part of his duty to advise them on the wisdom of their action."  In <b>Clark v
Barter</b> this contention was rejected by Clarke JA, because on the particular
facts in that case his Honour held that the solicitor's retainer
was not
limited to the preparation and execution of the mortgage, that an assurance
given by the solicitor had "led" the clients
into the transaction and the
solicitor had undertaken the responsibility of advising the clients about the
wisdom of the transaction.
 In the present case, I have held that Mr Williams'
retainer was the limited retainer I have already described.
<P>

389  	It was then submitted by counsel for Mr Sullivan that at the
meeting at his office on 14 November 1990 Mr Williams committed
a number of
breaches of the duty of care he owed Mr Sullivan.  I will deal with each of
these alleged breaches, in the order in which
they were dealt with in counsel
for Mr Sullivan's written submissions.
<P>

<b>1.	That Mr Williams should have seen Mr Sullivan separately and not in the
company of his other clients.</b>
<P>

390  	I have found that all of Craig Kelly, Marjory Craig and Mr
Sullivan were present throughout the meeting at Mr Williams' office
on 14
November 1990 and that Mr Williams did not give any advice to Mr Sullivan that
he should see Mr Sullivan separately.
<P>

391  	In <b>Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Tong </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20482" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41
NSWLR 482</a> at 486 Handley JA, with whose judgment the other members of the Court
concurred, said at p486:-
<P>

392  	"A solicitor seeking to give genuinely independent advice
should interview the client in private.  The client must be able
to ask
questions and express opinions free from any influence or constraint created by
the presence of others, especially if they
have a conflicting interest".
<P>

393  	I find that Mr Williams was in breach of his duty to Mr
Sullivan in not interviewing him privately or at least advising Mr
Sullivan
that he should interview him privately, without Craig Kelly and Marjory Craig
being present.
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams did not advise Mr Sullivan to obtain independent financial
advice</b>
<P>

394  	I have already held that Mr Williams' retainer, so far as Mr
Sullivan was concerned, was the limited retainer I have already
described.  It
was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that it was implied, if not expressed,
in Mr Williams' retainer that he should
advise Mr Sullivan to obtain
independent financial advice about the financial position of Nobsa, the company
whose indebtedness Mr
Sullivan was guaranteeing and securing.
<P>

395  	In support of this submission counsel relied on parts of the
judgment of King CJ of the Supreme Court of South Australia in
<b> McNamara v
Commonwealth Trading Bank</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2037%20SASR%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 37 SASR 232</a> especially at 241.  This was a
case under a South Australian Act which provided that guarantees of a certain
kind would be void,
unless they were executed by the guarantor in the presence
of a legal practitioner instructed independently of the credit provider.
 At
p241 King CJ said:-
<P>

"Although it is sufficient for the validity of the guarantee that it be
executed by the guarantor in the presence of the legal practitioner
and that
the legal practitioner certify as required by the section, the duty of a
solicitor to a client who consults him for advice
prior to signing a guarantee
extends much further.  The solicitor should raise with the client questions
relating to the prudence
of entering into the guarantee and should ascertain
whether the client wishes to be advised as to such questions.  The client may,
of course, indicate that he does not wish advice as to those matters and that
he is prepared to rely upon his own judgment.  But
unless the client so
instructs the solicitor, the instructions from the client should be regarded as
extending to advice on all matters
relating to the guarantee, including the
wisdom of entering into it from a practical point of view.  The state of the
financial affairs
of the principal debtor should be discussed as well as the
extent of the assets of the client.  A client whose assets are few and
who will
be putting the whole of his assets, perhaps including his home, at risk
obviously needs careful and perhaps quite forthright
advice.  The need is even
greater where, as so often is the case, the affairs of the principal debtor are
precarious".
<P>

396  	In <b>McNamara</b> Cox J agreed with the Chief Justice's
remarks about the nature and extent of a solicitor's duty.  Legoe J dissented.
King CJ made
his remarks in the context of the South Australian Act but his
Honour would appear to have intended his remarks to be of general
application.
His Honour considered that, in the absence of instructions to the contrary, a
solicitor's retainer should be regarded
as including that the solicitor should
himself offer advice on the financial wisdom of the proposed transaction.
<P>

397  	In the later South Australian case of <b>City Bank Savings
Limited v Nicholson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1997/6746.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] SASC 6784</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2070%20SASR%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 70 SASR 206</a> Perry J quoted with approval an
extract from the judgment of King CJ in <b>McNamara</b>, which included the
passages I have already quoted.  Perry J did resile to some extent from what
King CJ had said in <b>McNamara</b> by saying that it was not incumbent upon a
solicitor to attempt himself to give financial advice, as opposed to suggesting
that such
advice might be obtained from an accountant or other suitably
qualified person.
<P>

398  	In my opinion, Mr Williams' retainer by Mr Sullivan did not
contain an express or implied term that he should himself provide
financial
advice to Mr Sullivan.  This part of King CJ's judgment in <b>McNamara</b> is
contrary to New South Wales authority.
<P>

399  	Mr Sullivan's retainer of Mr Williams was similar to the
retainer in <b>Citicorp Australia</b>, where Sheller JA said at p413:-
<P>

"As a matter of contract, such a retainer would not, by inference or
implication, extend to require him to provide financial advice
to the O'Briens.
Nothing in the surrounding circumstances found by his Honour allowed such a
term to be inferred or implied".
<P>

400  	In <b>Tarzia v National Australia Bank Limited</b> (unreported
12 October 1995) the Full Court of the Federal Court said at p28:-
<P>

"It is not generally the task of solicitors to explain the financial result or
prudence of the transactions involved in documents
they are merely instructed
to explain.  Unless they undertake the task of doing so, or are specifically
retained to perform it and
supplied with the necessary information and
documentation, they will not be negligent for failing to do so".
<P>

401  	Nor do I consider that Mr Williams' retainer by Mr Sullivan
contained any term, express or implied, that he should advise
Mr Sullivan to
obtain independent financial advice.  Mr Williams was retained for the limited
purposes I have already described.
 Nor was there any express assumption by Mr
Williams of the responsibility of advising Mr Sullivan about the financial
wisdom or
prudence of the proposed mortgage or of advising Mr Sullivan to
obtain from someone else advice about the financial wisdom or prudence
of the
proposed mortgage.
<P>

402  	There remains the question whether Mr Williams was under an
obligation to advise Mr Sullivan to obtain independent financial
advice, even
though it was not within his retainer to give such advice and even though there
was no assumption of responsibility
by Mr Williams to give such advice. I have
already held that I consider that I should apply what Deane J said in
<b>Hawkins</b>, that the relationship of solicitor and client may give rise to
a duty on the part of the solicitor which requires the taking of
affirmative
steps beyond the specifically agreed task or function to avoid a real and
foreseeable risk of economic loss being sustained
by the client.  Priestley JA
observed in <b>Cousins</b> that Deane J was contemplating that some cases
would, and some cases would not, require a solicitor to do more than he was
specifically
retained to do.
<P>

403  	In <b>Tarzia</b> the Full Court of the Federal Court after
stating in the passage I have already quoted that it is not generally the task
of a solicitor
to give financial advice to a client about a proposed
transaction, added:-
<P>

"In certain situations it may be negligent of a solicitor not to ensure that
his client has good financial advice, particularly
when the client is at a
disadvantage with respect to the other parties to the transaction, and where
the results are potentially
disastrous for the client...".
<P>

404  	I do not, with respect, consider that a solicitor can be
obliged to "ensure" that his client has "good" financial advice.
 However, this
passage in the judgment of the Full Court does support the proposition that in
some cases a solicitor may be obliged
to advise his client to obtain financial
advice, although the giving of such advice by the solicitor is not required in
order to
perform his retainer.
<P>

405  	In the present case, Mr Williams knew that he was acting for a
number of parties, that Mr Sullivan had not been a director
or shareholder of
Nobsa, and was not to become a director or shareholder of Nobsa, that Mr
Sullivan lived interstate, that there
was an emotional relationship between Mr
Sullivan and the mother of Craig Kelly who had been a controller and was likely
to become
the sole controller of Nobsa and who was the person from whom Mr
Williams had been taking his instructions, that Nobsa was in financial
difficulties, that Craig Kelly was under financial pressure, that Mr Sullivan
was a proposed third party mortgagor and guarantor,
that the land over which
the mortgage was to be given was Mr Sullivan's home and his only substantial
asset and that Mr Sullivan
would not derive any personal benefit from the
transaction.  In all of these circumstances known to Mr Williams, I consider
that
Mr Williams did become subject to an obligation to take a step beyond what
he had agreed to do, so as to avoid a real and foreseeable
risk of economic
loss being sustained by Mr Sullivan, namely to advise Mr Sullivan that he
should obtain independent financial advice.
 I note that Mr Moses was of the
opinion that in the circumstances listed in his report, which are similar to
the circumstances I
have just listed, it would have been standard practice for
a solicitor to have advised the client that he should obtain independent
financial advice about the viability or otherwise of the debtor company.  Mr
Williams did not advise Mr Sullivan to obtain independent
financial advice and
in omitting to do so committed a breach of his duty to Mr Sullivan.
<P>

406  	The question remains whether if such advice had been given by
Mr Williams, Mr Sullivan would have acted on the advice and
sought independent
financial advice or whether, on the contrary, he would have told Mr Williams
that he did not wish to obtain independent
financial advice.
<P>

407  	As I have already remarked, no evidence was given by Mr
Sullivan that, if he had received advice from Mr Williams to obtain
independent
financial advice, he would have acted on the advice and sought independent
financial advice.  Such direct evidence is
not essential but the absence of
such evidence is a matter to be taken into account.
<P>

408  	Apart from the absence of direct evidence from Mr Sullivan,
there would be other grounds for finding that it has not been
established that,
if Mr Williams had advised Mr Sullivan to obtain independent financial advice,
Mr Sullivan would have acted on
the advice.  Mr Sullivan thought that the
business was doing well.  He gave evidence that "everybody assured me the
business was
doing well".  He had been told by Craig Kelly and Marjory Craig
that the business would do better, without any participation in it
by members
of the Ahmet family.  He trusted Craig Kelly and his mother, both of whom he
regarded as experienced in the restaurant
business and "great workers".  He had
been told by the estate agent that the asking price for Craig Kelly's house was
$590,000 and
that the house must sell for $500,000.  He had spoken twice to Mr
Weidenhofer, who was the accountant for the business and who he
trusted and had
been assured by Mr Weidenhofer that Mr Sullivan would have "no worries" and "no
problems", if he entered into the
mortgage.  Mr Sullivan had practically made
up his mind before speaking to Mr Weidenhofer "but I just wanted more
assurances.  I
think that (what Mr Weidenhofer said) clinched it".
<P>

409  	I have, however, decided that I should conclude that, if Mr
Sullivan had been advised by Mr Williams that he should obtain
independent
financial advice, Mr Sullivan would have taken such advice and would not have
entered into the mortgage.  Mr Williams
should have interviewed Mr Sullivan
separately and not in the presence of Craig Kelly or Marjory Craig.  The
circumstances known
to Mr Williams, which I have already summarised, were such
as to require the giving of quite forthright advice by Mr Williams.  If
Mr
Williams had seen Mr Sullivan separately and given forthright advice that Mr
Sullivan should seek independent financial advice,
then it is likely that Mr
Sullivan would have disclosed to Mr Williams Mr Sullivan's belief that the
mortgage to be given by him
would only be required for a short time until Craig
Kelly's house was sold.  Mr Williams would then have been obliged to advise Mr
Sullivan that this belief was ill founded.  In these circumstances, I consider
that Mr Sullivan would have realised that he needed
independent advice on the
wisdom or prudence of entering into the mortgage.
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams did not advise Mr Sullivan to obtain independent legal
advice</b>
<P>

410  	I have already held that Mr Williams should not have acted for
Mr Sullivan, without having first obtained his informed consent.
 However, I
have also held that if Mr Williams had given advice of the kind required, Mr
Sullivan would have instructed Mr Williams
to continue acting for him.
<P>

411  	I do not consider that it has been established that, if advice
to obtain independent legal advice had been given, Mr Sullivan
would have acted
on the advice.  No direct evidence was given on the issue by Mr Sullivan.  Mr
Sullivan trusted Craig Kelly and his
mother.  Mr Sullivan trusted Mr Williams.
He had seen Mr Williams at the restaurant.  If Mr Williams had advised Mr
Sullivan to obtain
independent legal advice, then I consider that, more
probably than not, Mr Sullivan would have said that there was no need for it
and that he wanted Mr Williams to act for him.
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams did not advise how Mr Sullivan's position could be
improved</b>
<P>

412  	I have accepted that at the meeting at Mr Williams' office Mr
Sullivan said words to the effect of "why doesn't Craig give
me something to
protect my interest?"  Mr Moses in his report suggested that an independent
solicitor could have advised on ways
in which Mr Sullivan's position could have
been improved, for example by the taking by Mr Sullivan of a second mortgage
over Mr Kelly's
property.  However, the taking by Mr Sullivan of a subsequent
mortgage over Mr Kelly's property would not have been of any practical
assistance to Mr Sullivan, as Mr Kelly's property was already mortgaged to the
Bank to secure his own personal indebtedness and Nobsa's
indebtedness and the
proceeds of sale of Mr Kelly's property were completed consumed in discharging
his personal indebtedness to
the Bank and part of the indebtedness of Nobsa to
the Bank.
<P>

413  	In any event, there would be no causal connection between the
omission to give advice to Mr Sullivan about how his position,
on the basis
that he entered into the mortgage, could be improved and his entering into the
mortgage.
<P>

414  	It was also suggested by Mr Moses that Mr Sullivan's position
could have been improved by limiting his liability under the
mortgage.
However, I have found that Mr Sullivan knew that his liability was unlimited
and that he was prepared to enter into the
mortgage on that basis.
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams gave a certificate of witness without first advising Mr
Sullivan that he should obtain independent financial and
legal advice and
receiving instructions from Mr Sullivan that he did not wish to obtain
independent financial or legal advice, without
advising Mr Sullivan that if a
conflict arose in the future between Mr Sullivan's interest and the interests
of Mr Williams' other
clients Mr Williams would not be able to act for Mr
Sullivan and without explaining the mortgage to Mr Sullivan</b>
<P>

415  	I have already dealt with this matter in deciding whether Mr
Williams should have acted for Mr Sullivan and in deciding whether
Mr Williams
should have advised Mr Sullivan to obtain independent financial advice or
independent legal advice.
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams did not secure the execution of an equitable mortgage by
Nobsa and did not explain to Mr Sullivan the equitable mortgage
from
Nobsa</b>
<P>

416  	The schedule to the mortgage to be executed by Mr Sullivan
provided that the mortgage was collateral to an equitable mortgage
of the same
date to be given by Nobsa.  No form of equitable mortgage by Nobsa was
forwarded by the Bank's solicitors to Mr Williams.
 Mr Williams did not realise
that he was supposed to have, and did not have, a document constituting an
equitable mortgage to be
given by Nobsa.
<P>

417  	I consider that Mr Williams was negligent in not realising that
he did not have any document constituting a security to be
given by the
principal debtor, which was referred to in the security to be given by his
client as guarantor, and in not ensuring
that such a document was executed by
the principal debtor.
<P>

418  	However, I am not satisfied that any causal connection has been
established between the negligent omission by Mr Williams
to secure the
execution of an equitable mortgage by Nobsa and the entering by Mr Sullivan
into the mortgage.  Mr Sullivan was quite
unaware that there was to be an
equitable mortgage from Nobsa and was prepared to execute the mortgage to be
given by him, without
there being any such security from Nobsa.  If Mr Williams
had realised that there should have been an equitable mortgage from Nobsa
and
had contacted the Bank's solicitors, then it is probable that an equitable
mortgage by Nobsa would have been prepared and executed.
<P>

419  	I am not satisfied that Mr Sullivan incurred any loss or damage
through the non-execution of an equitable mortgage by Nobsa.
 Nobsa had agreed
to provide an equitable mortgage and remained bound to execute a documentary
equitable mortgage.  When Nobsa was
wound up, the liquidator in fact proceeded
on the basis that there was such an equitable mortgage but in the event the
equitable
mortgage was worthless.
<P>

420  	As there was no document constituting an equitable mortgage
before him, Mr Williams could not have been expected to provide
an explanation
of it.  
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams did not explain the mortgage document to Mr Sullivan</b>
<P>

421  	On the basis of the findings I have already made, I consider
that Mr Williams did sufficiently explain the mortgage document
to Mr
Sullivan.
<P>

<b>That there were errors in the certificate given by Mr Williams</b>
<P>

422  	The first error alleged was that Mr Williams had incorrectly
stated in the certificate that the mortgage had been dated before
him.  The
mortgage bears the date 16 November 1990, and not 14 November 1990, and clearly
the date was inserted in the mortgage after
the certificate of witness had been
given on 14 November.  However, this error in the certificate was quite
immaterial.  The second
error alleged was that Mr Williams had not, as required
in order that paragraph (e) of the certificate could be correctly completed,
asked Mr Sullivan whether he had (i) compared his obligations and
responsibilities to the Bank with those of any other person named
in the
document (ii) considered the consequences to him should there be any default in
those obligations and responsibilities and
received the answer "yes".
<P>

423  	I have already found that, if Mr Williams merely followed his
usual practice and he did not claim that he had done anything
more, he would
not have asked Mr Sullivan a question in the terms of the question in paragraph
(e) of the certificate.  However,
he would have read to Mr Sullivan or would
have had Mr Sullivan read the "certificate of understanding", that is the
notice to customer/mortgagor/guarantor
regarding execution of documents, which
contained in paragraph (c) a provision similar to paragraph (e) of the
certificate of witness.
<P>

424  	On the basis of the findings I have already made, I consider
that Mr Williams sufficiently explained to Mr Sullivan his obligations
and
responsibilities under the mortgage and the consequences to him if there was
any default in those obligations and responsibilities
and that Mr Sullivan
understood those matters, that Mr Sullivan understood that Nobsa (the only
other person named in the mortgage)
was the principal debtor and that Mr
Sullivan would still have entered into the mortgage, if he had been asked a
question in the
terms of the question in paragraph (e) of the certificate.
<P>

<b>That Mr Williams advised Mr Sullivan, without having obtained a copy of the
Memorandum referred to in the mortgage</b>
<P>

425  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sullivan that it was negligent
for Mr Williams not to have obtained a copy of the memorandum,
because the
memorandum was important in that the personal covenant by Mr Sullivan was to be
found only in the memorandum and not
in the mortgage document and the
memorandum contained provisions referring to Queensland legislation.  It was
submitted that Mr Williams
could not have advised about these matters, without
having the memorandum in front of him, and it should be inferred that he did
not give Mr Sullivan any advice about these matters. 
<P>

426  	It is true, as I have found, that Mr Williams did not have a
copy of the memorandum at the meeting.  However, I accept that
he would have
made assumptions about the contents of the entire mortgage including the
memorandum, which would be true of the vast
majority of mortgages, including in
the case of a third party mortgage that the mortgagor would be liable to repay
the mortgagee
and that if there was a shortfall on realisation of the security
the mortgagor would be liable for the shortfall.  I am satisfied
that Mr
Williams made those assumptions in advising Mr Sullivan.  In any event, I have
found that Mr Sullivan knew that the money
which Nobsa owed to the Bank would
have to be paid to the Bank and that there was no limit on his own personal
liability.
<P>

427  	It was not shown, or even sought to be shown, that the
references in the memorandum to the <i>Queensland Credit Act</i> had any
relevance to the mortgage given by Mr Sullivan.
<P>

428  	I conclude that, if it had been necessary for me to consider
the cross-claim brought by Mr Sullivan against Mr Williams, I
would have held
that Mr Sullivan was entitled to succeed and recover damages for the loss
sustained by him as a result of entering
into the mortgage, on the basis that
Mr Williams negligently failed to interview Mr Sullivan separately from his
other clients and
negligently failed to advise Mr Sullivan to obtain
independent financial advice.  I would not have found that there was any
contributory
negligence by Mr Sullivan.
<P>

<b>Cross-claim:  Bank v Williams</b>
<P>

429  	I turn to the cross-claim brought by the Bank against Mr
Williams.  It is necessary to consider this cross-claim, because
I have held
that the Bank is not entitled to succeed in its claim against Mr Sullivan.
<P>

430  	The Bank, unlike Mr Sullivan, was not a client of Mr Williams
and hence Mr Williams did not owe the Bank (at any rate directly)
the duty of
care which a solicitor owes to a client.
<P>

431  	The nature of the duty which it was alleged Mr Williams owed
the Bank, as pleaded in the Bank's cross-claim, was that Mr Williams
owed a
duty to Mr Sullivan as his solicitor to ensure that Mr Sullivan received
independent legal advice and to adequately explain
to Mr Sullivan the terms of
the mortgage and the risk being undertaken by Mr Sullivan, that Mr Williams
knew or ought to have known
that the Bank would be relying on Mr Williams to
carry out the duties he owed to Mr Sullivan and that consequently Mr Williams
owed
a duty to the Bank to act carefully in carrying out his duties to Mr
Sullivan.  Although there was no formal amendment, the Bank
relied during the
hearing on an allegation that Mr Williams owed a duty to Mr Sullivan to advise
him that he should obtain independent
financial advice.  It was further alleged
in the Bank's cross-claim that, if what Mr Sullivan alleged in his cross-claim
against
the Bank was correct, then Mr Williams had committed breaches of the
duties he owed Mr Sullivan which were accordingly also breaches
of the duty Mr
Williams owed the Bank, and that as a result of those breaches the Bank would
suffer damage.  
<P>

432  	The question arises whether the duty owed by Mr Williams to the
Bank was as extensive as the duty alleged in the Bank's cross-claim
against Mr
Williams.  
<P>

433  	It is clear that Mr Williams owed some duty to the Bank.  The
form of certificate of witness was forwarded to Mr Williams
by the solicitors
acting for the Bank and Mr Williams signed the certificate of witness and sent
the signed certificate to the Bank's
solicitors, together with the executed
mortgage.  Mr Williams said in evidence that he knew that the Bank would be
relying on the
certificate of witness signed by him in going forward with the
transaction.  There was, however, no evidence that Mr Williams assumed
any
greater responsibility to the Bank than in and about giving the certificate of
witness or that the Bank relied on Mr Williams
having assumed any greater
responsibility.
<P>

434  	It was submitted on behalf of the Bank that the existence of a
duty of the width alleged in the Bank's cross-claim was supported
by what the
Full Court of the Federal Court had said on p28 of the judgment in
<b>Tarzia</b>.  However, what the Full Court of the Federal Court said on that
page of their judgment, although it would support a submission that
in certain
circumstances a solicitor may be in breach of his duty to his own client if he
does not give advice that financial advice
be obtained, does not appear to me
to lend any support to a submission that a solicitor will be in breach of a
duty owed by him to
the person providing credit to the client, if he does not
take such a step.
<P>

435  	In my opinion, Mr Williams did not owe any duty to the Bank
beyond a duty to exercise reasonable care in and about giving
the certificate
of witness.
<P>

436  	It is convenient to repeat at this stage the terms of the
certificate of witness
<P>

(a) The document was signed and dated before me
<P>

(b) I identified the parties before the document was signed
<P>

(c) I asked the parties whether the document was being signed voluntarily and
the answer was "yes"
<P>

(d) I asked the parties whether he understood the nature and effect of the
document and the answer was "yes"
<P>

(e) I asked the parties whether he has:-
<P>

(i) Compared his obligations and responsibilities to the Bank with those of any
other person named in the document; and
<P>

(ii) Considered the consequences to him should there be any default in those
obligations and responsibilities; and the answer was
"yes".
<P>

437  	Paragraph (a) of the certificate of witness is incorrect, in
that the mortgage was not dated before Mr Williams.  The Bank's
solicitors to
whom Mr Williams sent the mortgage on 14 November 1990 should have realised
that par(a) of Mr Williams' certificate
was not strictly correct but they made
no complaint.  In any event, this respect in which the certificate given by Mr
Williams was
not strictly correct is quite immaterial.
<P>

438  	On the findings I have made, there was no negligence by Mr
Williams in giving pars(b) and (c) of the certificate.  I am also
of the
opinion that the advice given and the questions asked by Mr Williams in
accordance with his usual practice, including the
question whether the client
understood what he was signing, constituted a substantial compliance with the
requirements of par(d)
of the certificate.  Paragraph (d), in my opinion, is
directed to whether the solicitor's client understands the nature and effect
of
the mortgage as a document and does not require an understanding on the part of
the client of what in the particular circumstances
of the client's case are the
financial risks the client may be running by entering into the mortgage.
<P>

439  	Paragraph (e) of the certificate is incorrect, in that Mr
Williams did not ask Mr Sullivan a question in the terms of par(e).
 However,
as I have already found, Mr Williams gave advice and asked questions which
amounted to a substantial compliance with par(e).
 In any event, as I have
held, if a question in the precise terms of par(e) had been asked, Mr Sullivan
would have replied in the
affirmative, the mortgage would still have been
entered into and the mortgage would still have been set aside, but only on the
ground
on which I consider it should be set aside and not on the ground that Mr
Williams had been negligent in and about giving the certificate
of witness.
<P>

440  	I conclude that any breaches by Mr Williams of the duty he owed
to the Bank to exercise reasonable care in and about the giving
of the
certificate of witness did not cause the loss the Bank has suffered through
entering into the mortgage with Mr Sullivan which
has been set aside.
<P>

441  	If I am wrong in holding that the duty owed by Mr Williams to
the Bank was limited to the duty I have described and if the
true position is
that the duty owed by Mr Williams to the Bank did extend to a duty to act
carefully in carrying out the duties he
owed to Mr Sullivan, then, as I have
found, there were some breaches by Mr Williams of the duties he owed Mr
Sullivan, which, on
the assumption I am presently making, would also be
breaches by Mr Williams of the duty he owed to the Bank.  It has not been as
a
result of any of those breaches that Mr Sullivan has obtained the relief sought
in his cross-claim against the Bank and has succeeded
in having the mortgage
set aside.  Mr Sullivan has obtained that relief, because I have held that the
mortgage was an unconscionable
dealing between the Bank and Mr Sullivan under
the principles in <b>Amadio</b>.  However, if Mr Williams had advised Mr
Sullivan to obtain independent financial advice, Mr Sullivan, and hence the
Bank, would
not have entered into the mortgage and consequently the Bank would
have retained the mortgage from Mr Ahmet and not suffered any
loss or
damage.
<P>

442  	There should be a verdict for Mr Williams on the Bank's
cross-claim against Mr Williams.
<P>

443  	There should be verdicts for Mr Sullivan on the claim, the
first cross-claim and the second cross-claim.  I will defer the
making of
formal orders and the making of any orders for costs, until the parties have
had an opportunity of considering these reasons
for judgment.
