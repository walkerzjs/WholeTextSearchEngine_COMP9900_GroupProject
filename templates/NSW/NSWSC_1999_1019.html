Jennifer Fuller &amp; 2 Ors</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>	</u></b>
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment on costs</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR:  The amount of the judgment in this
matter, calculated in accordance with my reasons of 22 October and 17 December
1998, was almost seven million dollars.  On 26 September 1996, while the case
was part heard, the plaintiff made an offer of compromise
under Part 22 of the
Supreme Court Rules of roughly five million, seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.  Her counsel now seeks
costs on an indemnity basis for the period
after that date because the judgment is no less favourable than the terms of
that offer:
Pt 52A, r 22(4).
<P>

2    	At the time the offer was made the plaintiff's
particulars under Pt 33, r 8A did not include a claim for a night carer.  That
claim was made later in amended particulars and was allowed, the amount
involved being in the order of one million, one hundred and
fifty thousand
dollars.  Counsel for the plaintiff accepts that that sum should be deducted
from the amount of the judgment for the
purpose of comparing it with the amount
of the offer: cf <i>Van Doore v Mendez </i>(Dunford J, unreported, 30 June
1997).  Even so, the judgment exceeds the offer by about $48,000.
<P>

3    	The policy behind a provision such as Pt 52A, r
22(4), and the principles governing the exercise of the discretion conferred
by
it, were summarised in <i>Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR
721</a> at 724-6: see also <i>Morgan v Johnson </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/367.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 367</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 578</a> at 581-2.
It is clear that a plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to an order for indemnity
costs when the conditions of the sub-rule
are met, and it would be only in an
exceptional case that the Court would order otherwise.  Is this that
exceptional case?
<P>

4    	To understand the argument of counsel for the
defendants that it is, it is necessary to refer to the protracted history of
the hearing.  It proceeded intermittently over the period between 13 May 1996
and 24 April 1997.  I did not give judgment until October
of the following
year.  Calculations were then made to give effect to my reasons, the figures in
relation to some heads of damage
being brought up to date.  A major head of
damage, of course, was attendant care and on that matter I received further
evidence of
the rates paid to various levels of carer by Macquarie Nursing
Service as at November 1998.  This was the subject of my supplementary
judgment
of 17 December 1998.
<P>

5    	For the purpose of the argument on costs, counsel for
the defendants produced a schedule which purported to calculate the
amount of
the judgment if the heads of damages had been assessed in accordance with the
particulars under Pt 33, r 8A of 10 May 1996.
 Those were the particulars on
foot at the time the plaintiff's offer of compromise was made in September of
that year.  That calculation
was adjusted somewhat in further written
submissions.  On this approach, and assuming the figures to be correct, the
judgment would
have totalled about five million, one hundred and thirty-one
thousand dollars, roughly six hundred and seventeen thousand dollars
less than
the plaintiff's offer.
<P>

6    	Counsel for the defendants submitted that this is how
the judgment should be viewed in "real terms".  He pointed out that
the offer
of settlement was made after the hearing had commenced, and at a time when the
completion of the hearing and the delivery
of judgment might have been
anticipated in the relatively near future.  This was not a case, he argued,
where an offer was made at
an early stage of the litigation, when the parties
would have been aware that it would be a matter of years before the case could
come to hearing.  Reliance was placed upon the following passage from
<i>Maitland Hospital </i>(supra) at 725:
<P>

Litigation is inescapably chancy.  The purpose of the rule is to put a premium
on realistic assessment of cases.  It is not to demand
perfect foresight which
is denied even to the judges.  That is why a discretion is retained, under the
rule, for the Court to order
otherwise than as the rule provides.  But the
ordinary provision is expected to apply in the ordinary case.
<P>

7    	The matter appears to be devoid of authority.
Nevertheless, I can see the point  of counsel's argument and I am conscious
of
the fact that my delay in delivering judgment accounts for much of the time
which elapsed after the offer of settlement.  On the
other hand, as counsel for
the plaintiff pointed out, delay in the completion of a hearing which has
already commenced and in the
delivery of judgment are not uncommon, and are
matters to which regard should be had when considering an offer made at or
about the
time of hearing.  In all the circumstances, I do not consider the
present case to be so far out of the ordinary as to call for a
departure from
the usual approach.
<P>

8    	Counsel for the defendants also argued that I should
exercise my discretion in their favour, in any event, in the light of
what was
said to be the insignificant difference between the amount of the judgment and
the plaintiff's offer.  Forty-eight thousand
dollars is a tidy sum but, it was
said, it is minuscule in the light of the very large figures involved.  It is
less than one percent
of the amount which the plaintiff was prepared to accept
and an even smaller proportion of the amount awarded.
<P>

9    	However, the fact remains that, using the terms of Pt
52A, r 22(4), the judgment is "no less favourable" than the offer. 
Similar
arguments have failed to persuade other Courts: see <i>Maitland Hospital v
Fisher </i>(supra) at 722, 724-5 and <i>Connor v Hatgis (No 2) </i>(Court of
Appeal, unreported, 7 December 1995).  As Kirby P and Priestly JA observed in
the latter case, "it will often be the case
that the indemnity cost rule will
apply to offers close to the sum eventually recovered".
<P>

10    	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is
entitled to the order sought.  The defendants should pay the plaintiff's
costs
on a party and party basis up to and including 16 September 1996, and
thereafter on an indemnity basis.
