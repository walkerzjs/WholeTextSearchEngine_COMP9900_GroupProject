<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>HER HONOUR:</b>
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	By Amended Summons filed on 23 March 1999 the plaintiff
claims orders having the effect of permanently staying the prosecution
of a
charge of breach of discipline contrary to s 83(f) of the <b>Teaching Services
Act</b> 1980 ("the Act") set out in a Notice of Charge dated 10 July 1998 as
amended by Notice dated 2 March 1999.  
<P>

2   	The plaintiff is a teacher in the employ of the Education
Teaching Service. The first defendant is the Director-General of
Education and
Training. The second defendant is an Assistant Director-General of the
Department of School Education ("the Department")
being the prescribed officer
appointed pursuant to s 84 (1) of the Act to deal with the charge brought
against the plaintiff. The
third defendant is an Assistant Director-General of
the Department. She brings the charge against the plaintiff.
<P>

3   	The misconduct the subject of the charge relates to events
in May 1987.  The plaintiff is said to have engaged in inappropriate
touching
of a number of primary school children whilst he was their supervisor at a
residential camp.
<P>

4   	The subject matter of the charges was, in general terms,
brought to the attention of the Department in May 1987.  The plaintiff
was
interviewed at that time and an investigation was conducted.  He was relieved
of teaching duties during the currency of the investigation.
 A charge of
breach of discipline was preferred against him pursuant to s 83(f) of the
<b>Education Commission Act</b> 1980 (as the Act was then titled) alleging that
he had engaged in disgraceful or improper conduct.  That matter was listed for
hearing
on 8 December 1988.  The plaintiff signified his intention of defending
the matter. The charge was withdrawn prior to hearing. 
<P>

5   	In August 1997 the plaintiff became aware that the
Department was reinvestigating the 1987 allegations and in July 1998 a fresh
charge of breach of discipline was brought against him. 
<P>

6   	By these proceedings the plaintiff seeks to stay the
further prosecution of this charge upon two grounds:
<P>

(i)	the lengthy delay in instituting the present proceedings has deprived him
of the opportunity of a fair hearing; and
<P>

(ii)	the revival of charges arising out of the same set of events as the
subject of the discontinued proceedings is in all the circumstances
oppressive.

<P>

7   	The matter came on for hearing before me on 4 November
1999. Mr Porter QC and Mr Bauer appeared for the plaintiff. Mr Menzies
QC and
Mr Horsley appeared for the defendants.
<P>

8   	In the plaintiff's case two affidavits sworn by Mr P A
MacMahon, the plaintiff's solicitor, were read. To those were annexed
a number
of documents including correspondence passing between Mr MacMahon and officers
of the Department concerning the charges.
 The plaintiff gave oral evidence.
The affidavit of William Jardine, Principal Investigator with the Department's
Case Management
Unit, sworn on 2 March 1999 was read in the defendants' case.
Mr Jardine gave supplementary oral evidence and was cross-examined.
A bundle of
papers described by Mr Menzies as "the departmental file" was tendered in the
defendants' case; Ex 1. The papers submitted
by the Department to the
prescribed officer in support of the charge were also tendered in the
defendants' case; Ex 2. 
<P>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

9   	In May of 1987 the plaintiff was employed as a teacher at
the Broken Bay School for Specific Purposes. That school operated
residential
camps for children drawn from a number of primary schools.  Children from the
Brookvale, Clovelly and Normanhurst Primary
Schools attended a week long camp
commencing on 18 May 1987.  It was the plaintiff's responsibility to supervise
the children assigned
to a dormitory which was named "Magpie Lodge".  The
dormitory contained a number of double bunks. The plaintiff's bedroom was
located
at the end of the dormitory. 
<P>

10   	The plaintiff gave massages to some of the children who
attended this camp.  It appears that he had done so with other groups
of
children on previous occasions.  He had undertaken a course in massage offered
by the Department as part of inservice training.
It is not suggested that the
Department through instruction offered at this course, or in any other context,
conveyed that teachers
should offer massages to primary school children.
However, the plaintiff believed that giving massages to the children might
relax
them and settle them for the night's sleep.  The children were aged 9 and
10 years. 
<P>

11   	The plaintiff has at all times been open in admitting to
massaging children under his care.  It is his account that there
were no sexual
overtones to the massages which did not include touching the bottoms or genital
areas of the children.  
<P>

12   	The plaintiff cuddled some of the children. This was done
in the case of a few homesick children. 
<P>

13   	The plaintiff hopped up on the bunks of some of the
children in the mornings when he was trying to get them out of bed.
<P>

14   	On 19 May 1987 at around 6.30 pm the plaintiff was spoken
to by Mr Russell, the Principal of the Broken Bay School. Mr Russell
had
received a complaint from a fellow teacher, Paul Lester, concerning the
plaintiff's conduct. 
<P>

15   	The Department's file contains some handwritten notes,
dated 19 May 1987, which appear to be a record of Mr Russell's discussion
with
the plaintiff. During that interview the plaintiff agreed that he had massaged
children in Magpie Lodge but disagreed that the
massage had included touching
their bottoms.  He appears to have agreed that he had got into bed with
children in the mornings and
that he had given them cuddles.  He agreed that he
had wrestled with children in his own room on the bed.  He denied various other
matters.  
<P>

16   	Following this interview the plaintiff was placed on
compensatory leave and relieved of his duties at the school.  The Department
commenced an investigation of the plaintiff's conduct. The Department of Youth
and Community Services was notified of the complaint
and officers of that
Department interviewed some of the children.  
<P>

17   	By letter dated 4 January 1988 the plaintiff was notified
of a charge brought against him pursuant to s 83(f) of the <b>Education
Commission Act</b> 1980 alleging that he had engaged in disgraceful and
improper conduct.  Particulars of that charge alleged that in the period
between
18 May 1987 and 22 May 1987 at Magpie Lodge he had:
<P>

&#183;	massaged a pupil, AZ, on the back lifting his pyjama shirt and pulling
down his pyjama pants and massaging his bottom;
<P>

&#183;	massaged a pupil, SW, on the back and pulled down his pyjamas and
massaged his bottom.  It was alleged that the plaintiff
had got into bed with
SW and placed his hand upon SW's shoulder;
<P>

&#183;	got into bed with a pupil, DW;
<P>

&#183;	massaged a pupil, DO, on the back;
<P>

&#183;	got into bed and hugged a pupil, RH;
<P>

&#183;	massaged a pupil, LS;
<P>

&#183;	attempted to get into bed with a pupil, MD.  
<P>

18   	The plaintiff was directed to advise the Department within
fourteen days as to whether he admitted or denied the truth of
the charges laid
against him.  By letter dated 25 January 1998 the plaintiff's solicitors
advised the Department of the plaintiff's
response to the particulars of the
charge.  In general terms he admitted massaging pupils but denied touching them
on their bottoms.
 As to the allegation that he had got into bed with various
of the pupils the plaintiff denied getting under the covers of the beds
of any
of the children.  He indicated that he was not able to remember the student RH
but admitted that he may well have hugged him
in an effort to console him and
help him overcome homesickness.  
<P>

19   	The plaintiff gave evidence that there had been a police
investigation into the allegations. He was interviewed by a detective
in late
November or December of 1988.  He was informed that the police did not intend
to pursue the matter further.
<P>

20   	The prescribed officer appointed to determine the charge
of breach of discipline elected to hold an inquiry into the matter.

<P>

21   	The inquiry was fixed for hearing on 8 December 1988. On 5
December 1988 Mr Horton, the departmental officer with carriage
of the matter,
advised the plaintiff's solicitors that he had received instructions to
withdraw the charge. On 7 December 1988 Mr
G Comino, Assistant Director
Personnel, wrote to the plaintiff advising him that the disciplinary charge had
been withdrawn.  In
that letter the plaintiff was warned that his actions had
been unwise, indiscreet and na&iuml;ve.  It was noted that such actions
may be
easily misunderstood and were liable to be misinterpreted by the children and
their parents.  The plaintiff was directed not
to have any direct physical
contact with pupils in the future.  
<P>

22   	The plaintiff was required to attend an interview with Mr
Comino at the Department's Head Office on 8 December 1988.  He attended
that
interview. In the course of it he was counselled not to engage in any physical
contact with children. 
<P>

23   	The plaintiff said in evidence that after the charge was
withdrawn a man named Bob Nicholls, who was then either the Director
or the
Assistant Director of the North Regional Office, spoke to him at that office
and said, "Here's the file". Mr Nicholls proceeded
to shred the file in the
presence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff presumed that the documents being
shredded related to the allegations
which had been made against him.
<P>

24   	As at 1987 the plaintiff did not consider his actions in
massaging primary age school children, giving them cuddles and hopping
up on
their bunks with them was inappropriate. He says that he would not now so
conduct himself. 
<P>

25   	The plaintiff resumed teaching duties at the beginning of
1989 at the Marayong Public School. He remained at that school for
six years.
He was then transferred to the Seven Hills Public School. Thereafter he was
promoted to the position of Executive Teacher
at the Shelley Public School. 
<P>

26   	Sometime after the charge was withdrawn portions of the
file maintained by the plaintiff's solicitors, including the plaintiff's
instructions concerning the May 1987 allegations, were destroyed in the
ordinary course.
<P>

27   	In July of 1997 the Department appears to have commenced a
fresh investigation of the allegations concerning the plaintiff's
behaviour at
the Broken Bay School's Magpie Lodge in 1987.  This investigation was commenced
by District Superintendent Graham Kennedy.
 Subsequently, Mr Jardine took over
the conduct of the investigation.  
<P>

28   	On 5 August 1997 the plaintiff was advised by letter
signed by Ms Blackadder, Chief Investigator of the Department's Case
Management
Unit, of allegations that he had engaged in improper conduct including conduct
that could amount to conduct of a sexual
nature with a student during the
period 11 May 1987 to 22 May 1987 at the Broken Bay Sports and Recreation
Centre.  The plaintiff
was directed to provide a written response to the
allegations within fourteen days.  The allegations contained in Ms Blackadder's
letter were expressed in the most general of terms and did not particularise
specific instances when the plaintiff was said to have
misconducted himself.
It is to be noted that the allegations covered a broader period, namely 11 May
to 22 May 1987, than had been
the subject of the initial, discontinued,
charge.
<P>

29   	The plaintiff was removed from teaching duties and
assigned to work in the Department's Property Section at Blacktown.  
<P>

30   	By letter dated 20 August 1997 the plaintiff's solicitor
wrote to Ms Blackadder seeking particulars of the allegations.  There
appears
to have been no response to that request and on 9 February 1998 the solicitor
renewed his request.  On 16 March 1998 the
third defendant wrote to Mr MacMahon
apologising for the delay in the Department's response to his request for
further particulars.
 In that letter the third defendant advised that the
allegations put to the plaintiff on 5 August 1997 were withdrawn and the
plaintiff's
response was requested to a series of eight allegations.
Allegations 1 and 2 alleged misconduct in the period 11 May to 15 May 1987
involving a student, SI, and another student, TH.  Allegations 3-8 inclusive
raised the very matters that had been the subject of
the charges which were
withdrawn in December 1988.  
<P>

31   	In relation to the first two allegations it is to be
observed that with respect to the student SI it was contended that the
plaintiff had massaged his shoulders and chest and said words to the effect,
"Do you want me to go down your shorts as well?" and
thereafter proceeded to
massage the student under his shorts. The particulars as supplied in March 1998
did not assert that the plaintiff
had touched SI's penis or scrotum.  As to the
student TH it was alleged that the plaintiff had got into bed with TH, cuddled
him
and "touched the student's genitals".  
<P>

32   	Mr MacMahon responded to the third defendant's letter by
letter dated 25 March 1998 setting out the history of the matter
and drawing
attention to the circumstance that a number of the allegations had been the
subject of a charge which had been withdrawn.
 
<P>

33   	On 5 June 1998 the third defendant advised that she had
determined to take no further action with respect to allegations 3-8
inclusive
and that a charge was then being drafted with respect to allegations 1 and 2.

<P>

34   	By letter dated 10 July 1998 under the hand of the third
defendant the plaintiff was notified of a charge brought pursuant
to s 83(f) of
the Act alleging that he had engaged in improper conduct.  That charge was
particularised by reference to the allegation
concerning the students SI and
TH.  It is to be noted that the particulars alleged with respect to SI now
included an allegation
that the plaintiff had touched the student's penis and
scrotum with his hand.  The particulars relating to the allegations made by
the
student TH were in similar terms to those notified in the Department's letter
of 16 March 1998.
<P>

35   	By letter dated 1 December 1998 the plaintiff's solicitors
were advised that the second defendant had been appointed by the
first
defendant as the prescribed officer to deal with the charges brought against
him.  Having considered both the charge and the
plaintiff's response the second
defendant had determined to deal with the charges pursuant to cl 15(2)(a) of
the <b>Teaching Services (Education Teaching Service) Regulation</b> 1994.  
<P>

36   	On 14 December 1998 the plaintiff commenced the present
proceedings.  
<P>

37   	On 2 March 1999 the third defendant advised the
plaintiff's solicitors of an amendment to the charge.  She explained that
the
amendments were intended to bring before the prescribed officer the events that
took place at the first camp from 11 May to 15
May 1987 and the second camp
from 18 May to 22 May 1987.  The charge as amended repeats the allegations
concerning the students SI
and TH who both attended the first camp.
Additionally, the third defendant relies on allegations concerning the students
AZ, SW,
DW, DO, RH, LS and MD, each of whom was the subject of the earlier
charges which were withdrawn. These students were at the second
camp.
Allegations are made concerning three children, LS, CO and BK.  These
allegations also relate to the second camp.  It is clear
from a review of the
materials forming part of the Department's file (Ex 1) that the allegations
concerning LS, CO and BK were investigated
in 1987.
<P>

 <b>Disciplinary Charges - The Statutory Scheme</b>
<P>

38   	Section 83(f) of the Act provides that an officer of the
teaching service who engages in any disgraceful or improper conduct
is guilty
of a breach of discipline.  A breach of discipline is to be dealt with by the
Director General of Education or a prescribed
officer:  s 84(1).  The second
defendant is an Assistant Director General of the Department of Education and a
prescribed officer
for the purposes of s 84(1).  He has been appointed as the
prescribed officer to deal with the charge brought against the plaintiff.
Section 84(2) provides that the Regulations may make provision with respect to
the manner of dealing with alleged breaches of discipline.
 
<P>

39   	Clause 15 of the <b>Teaching Services (Education Teaching
Service) Regulation</b> 1994 provides that if a member of staff denies the
truth of a disciplinary charge the disciplinary authority (in this case the
prescribed
officer) may deal with the charge in one of two ways:
<P>

(a) by directing the member of  staff to furnish an explanation in writing
within such time (being at least 14 days) as is specified
in the direction;
or
<P>

(b) by conducting an inquiry.
<P>

It is to be noted that cl 15(3) provides that in the event the prescribed
officer takes action under cl 2(a), namely by directing
the member of staff to
furnish an explanation in writing, he or she may make a finding after
considering the reports and any explanation.
Alternatively, at that point, the
prescribed officer may decide to deal with the matter by conducting an
inquiry.
<P>

40   	In cases where it is determined to conduct an inquiry the
prescribed officer must give written notice to the member of staff
of the time,
date and place at which the inquiry is to be conducted.  The prescribed officer
may call on any person to appear and
give evidence, and to produce documents,
at the inquiry.  The member of staff may be represented by a barrister,
solicitor or agent.
<P>

41   	Where the prescribed officer finds that the member of
staff has committed the breach of discipline charged, s 85 of the Act
sets out
the range of punishments which may be imposed. The prescribed officer may, upon
finding a breach to have been committed,
recommend to the Director General that
the member of staff be dismissed from the teaching service or that he or she be
required or
allowed to resign.  The Director General may act on such a
recommendation or decide to impose one of the lesser punishments set out
in s
85(1).  
<P>

42   	A member of the Education Teaching Service may appeal
against the decision, or decision to make a recommendation, to impose
a
punishment pursuant to s 85(1) (other than a decision to caution or reprimand)
to the Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal
pursuant to s 24 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/gareata1980458/" class="autolink_findacts">Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal Act</a></b> 1980.
Alternatively, an officer dismissed from the teaching service following an
adverse finding by a prescribed officer may apply
to the Industrial Commission
pursuant to s 84 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act</a></b> 1996 claiming that the
dismissal is harsh, unreasonable or unjust.
<P>

43   	The second defendant made a determination on 1 December
1998 to deal with the charge pursuant to cl 15(2)(a) of the <b>Teaching
Services (Education Teaching Service) Regulation</b> 1994.   This was a
determination to deal with the matter by directing the member of staff to
furnish an explanation in writing. 
There is no suggestion that the amendment
of the particulars of the charge notified by the third defendant's letter of 2
March 1999
has caused the prescribed officer to review his determination.

<P>

44   	In <b>Matkevich v NSW Technical and Further Education
Commission [No 3]</b> unreported NSWCA 2 February 1996 the court dealt with a
challenge to the exercise of the prescribed officer's discretion to deal
with a
disciplinary charge upon the written reports.  It was contended that, in the
light of the nature and seriousness of the allegations,
procedural fairness
required that the appellant be given a right to cross-examine and test
witnesses.  One of the charges against
the appellant alleged that he had
sexually harassed a student.  That submission was rejected.  Cole JA
observed:
<P>

"Once it is accepted that a discretion to hold an inquiry or not exists as a
matter of law, and that there was no procedural unfairness
in relation to the
exercise of that discretion, it cannot be said that the factual circumstances
are such as to remove the right
to exercise the discretion in the manner which
occurred.  So to hold would be to rewrite the regulation" (at 14).
<P>

45   	I was informed by the parties that the Court of Appeal has
reserved judgment in a matter of <b>Hill v Buckley</b> in which further
consideration has been given to this aspect of the decision in
<b>Matkevich</b>.  
<P>

46   	In the light of the decision in <b>Matkevich</b> no issue
as to the exercise of the second defendant's discretion to proceed upon the
written reports pursuant to cl 15(2)(a) of the
Act was pursued in the
proceedings before me. 
<P>

<b>Jurisdiction</b>
<P>

47   	Mr Porter submitted that the power to grant the plaintiff
the relief he seeks is analogous to the Court's power to supervise
disciplinary
proceedings before the Medical Tribunal; <b>Walton v Gardiner</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177
CLR 378.</a>  I note that similar orders to those which the plaintiff here claims
were sought by the plaintiff in <b>Smith v Boston &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/1116.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC
1116.</a>  In that case Sperling J approached the matter upon the basis that the
statements of principle in<b> Walton</b> (concerning stays of proceedings on
abuse of process grounds) were applicable to disciplinary proceedings under the
<b>Teaching Services Act</b> (paragraphs 61 - 63).
<P>

48   	The first and third defendants were also defendants in
<b>Smith</b>. I was informed by<b> </b>Mr Menzies, who appeared for the
defendants in <b>Smith</b> that he did not take issue with the Court's
jurisdiction to grant the relief sought in that case. That was not his stance
in the
proceedings before me.  In written submissions it was put this way:
<P>

"While there are similarities between those cases (<b>Herron v McGregor</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 246</a>, <b>Walton</b>) and this, those similarities are
superficial.  In those cases the courts were exercising their inherent
jurisdiction to prevent
abuse of the process of inferior courts, and of
(court-like) tribunals.  The very concept of `abuse of process' suggests courts
and
court-like bodies.  It has never been suggested that the supervisory
jurisdiction extends to bodies, such as the department or the
prescribed
officer, making more informal inquiries.  
<P>

This is a case of an employer dealing with its employee.  The Director-General
or his prescribed officer are not obliged to act
judicially.  This case does
not involve any tribunal, whose process may be abused and is subject to the
supervisory jurisdiction
of this court.  Therefore the power invoked in the
cases referred to above does not apply to this case.  The plaintiff seeks to
stop
the investigation at an earlier stage."
<P>

49   	I do not understand the sense in which it is suggested
that the prescribed officer is "making more informal inquiries" nor
what is
intended by the submission that the prescribed officer is not obliged to act
judicially. 
<P>

50   	The investigation of the alleged breach of discipline has
been completed.  In accordance with the scheme provided by the <b>Teaching
Services Act</b> a charge, properly particularised, has been preferred and the
matter is now in the hands of the prescribed officer for determination.
 The
prescribed officer has a duty to act fairly; <b>Kioa v West</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR

In order to discharge that duty he must accord the plaintiff an opportunity to
make answer to the case brought
against him.   
<P>

51   	It was Mr Porter's submission that the plaintiff has been
deprived, having regard to the length of delay in bringing the charge,
of the
ability to fairly respond to the allegations made against him.  That is so
whether he makes his response in writing or at
an inquiry. Whether the second
defendant determines to deal with the disciplinary charge pursuant to cl
15(2)(a) or 15(2)(b) Mr Porter
submitted the jurisdiction of this Court to
restrain the proceedings on abuse of process grounds exists having regard to
the decision
of the court in <b>Walton</b>.  
<P>

52   	In <b>Walton</b> the majority held that the court's
supervisory jurisdiction extended to the power to stay proceedings before the
Medical Tribunal
on the ground of abuse of process:  per Mason CJ, Deane and
Dawson JJ at p.392  Their Honours rejected the submission that the jurisdiction
to stay on the grounds of abuse is confined to cases where the court is
satisfied that any hearing before the Disciplinary Tribunal
would necessarily
be unfair or where the proceedings have been brought for an improper purpose.
Where the continuation of proceedings
would involve unacceptable injustice, in
the sense of being unjustifiably oppressive, the court might order a stay.  In
the latter
regard their Honours (at p.394) cited the observations of Deane J in
<b>Jago v District Court of New South Wales</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 23</a> at 58:
<P>

"The power of a court to stay proceedings in a case of unreasonable delay is
not confined to the case where the effect of the delay
is that any subsequent
trial must necessarily be an unfair one.  Circumstances can arise in which such
delay produces a situation
in which any continuation of the proceedings would,
of itself, be so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive that it would constitute
an abuse of the court's process.  Multiple prosecutions arising out of the one
set of events but separated by many years or a renewed
charge brought years
after the dismissal of earlier proceedings for want of prosecution could, in a
case where the relevant material
had been available to the prosecution from the
outset and depending on the particular facts, provide examples.  Where such
circumstances
exist, the power of a court to prevent abuse of its process
extends to the making of an order that proceedings be permanently stayed."
<P>

53   	Mr Porter relied both on actual prejudice occasioned by
the long delay in bringing the present proceedings and on that category
of
unjustifiable oppression to which Deane J referred in <b>Jago</b> in the
passage set out above.  As to actual prejudice he relied on the following
matters:
<P>

&#183;	The loss of the plaintiff's contemporaneous account contained in
instructions given to his solicitors some time prior to
December 1988. 
<P>

&#183;	The plaintiff now has no recollection of the individual pupils the
subject of the particularised complaints. 
<P>

&#183;	The Department's own file is incomplete.
<P>

&#183;	There was a police investigation into the May 1987 allegations. No
record of the extent and nature or outcome of that investigation
is known. 
<P>

54   	As to the submission contending that the bringing of the
charge is unjustifiably oppressive Mr Porter submitted that although
not framed
in identical terms to the withdrawn 1988 charge in substance it raises the same
matters. 
<P>

55   	I consider that this Court does have the power to grant
the plaintiff the relief he seeks in the light of the decision in
<b>Walton</b>. The principles which inform the Court's supervision of
disciplinary proceedings against doctors brought under the <b>Medical
Practitioners Act </b>1938 (now the <b>Medical Practice Act</b> 1992) seem to
me to apply with equal force to the statutory scheme for the discipline of
teachers provided under the <b>Teaching Services Act</b>. The second defendant
is charged with the duty of determining whether or not the plaintiff has been
guilty of a breach of discipline
within the meaning of s 83(f) of the Act. It
does not seem to me that the question of whether the proceedings are the
subject of
supervision by this Court should depend upon whether he determines
to hold an inquiry pursuant to cl 15(2)(b) of the <b>Teaching Services
(Education Teaching Service) Regulation</b> 1994 or to deal with the matter on
a review of written reports pursuant to cl 15(2)(a).  
<P>

<b>The Lost Documents </b>
<P>

56   	It was Mr Porter's submission that documents relating to
the initial investigation in 1987/88 are missing from the Department's
file. In
particular he points to the fact that there are no contemporaneous statements
taken from the children (or the parents of
the children) or staff at the Broken
Bay School for Specific Purposes. The matter was prepared for a hearing on 8
December 1988.
It was not until 5 December or shortly before that a decision
was made to withdraw the charge. It was submitted that it was inconceivable
that the Department would have approached within three days of an inquiry
without statements from prospective witnesses.
<P>

57   	Mr Menzies did not concede that the Departmental file was
in any relevant respect incomplete. It was on his submission mere
conjecture to
contend that there had been statements or other relevant materials which had
since been lost or destroyed.
<P>

58   	Mr Jardine gave evidence concerning his knowledge of the
history of the departmental file, Ex 1. He explained that it comprised
papers
which were collected in 1996. In that year papers of this description (which I
took to be a reference to investigations of
allegations of misconduct) were
centralised within the Case Management Unit. Prior to this time they had been
held at the regional
offices. Mr Jardine was not able to indicate with
certainty from which Regional Office these papers had come.  However, he
pointed
to a stamp on one document from the Metropolitan North Regional
Office.
<P>

59   	In cross-examination it was put to Mr Jardine that the
Department would not have "gone into bat" at an inquiry without having
statements from the boys which were said to be the evidence against the
teacher. Mr Jardine said he thought it would be unlikely
but he had no
knowledge of the procedure. I understood him to be saying that he was not aware
of what procedures were adopted by
departmental officers as at 1987/88. In his
own experience he obtains statements. 
<P>

60   	Mr Jardine agreed that he thought there would have been a
file. It was possible that it had been shredded or destroyed. His
predecessor,
Mr Kennedy, had attempted to find the old file but had not been able to do so.
The papers comprised in Ex 1 are all
the papers that were located.  
<P>

61   	Mr Jardine was not able to offer any explanation as to why
the 1988 charge had been withdrawn. 
<P>

62   	Mr Porter invited me to draw two inferences from this body
of evidence. Firstly, that the file Ex 1 is either incomplete or
not the only
file maintained by the Department concerning the 1987 allegations and that a
number of documents, including statements
taken from the children, have been
lost or destroyed. Secondly, that the charge in 1988 was withdrawn for good and
sufficient reason.
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=63%20Exch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">63   	Ex 1</a> comprises some correspondence passing between
Departmental officers and the plaintiff and/or his solicitors in 1988. There
are copies
of reports submitted by officers attached to the Department of Youth
&amp; Community Services concerning interviews carried out by
them with the
children the subject of the allegations. These reports contain a summary
<P>

in each case of the child's account. There are also various handwritten notes
apparently made by one or more departmental officers
connected with the
investigation. 
<P>

64   	There is no reference in Ex 1 to statements having been
taken from any of the children. I note that among the handwritten
file notes
contained in Ex 1 are notes dated 13/10/88. Those appear to be notes of an
interview between a departmental officer and
Robert Steuart, District Officer.
On the same page are notes which may record an interview between the
departmental officer and RH,
LS and SF. Next to RH's name appears a notation
"recall very little" (report refreshes) very hazy". That might lend some
support
to the view that statements were taken from the children in
anticipation of the inquiry then listed for 8 December 1988 and that
the same
have since been lost or destroyed. However, I do not think I can infer that is
the case as a matter of probability. I think
it more likely that this note
records Mr Steuart's account of the allegations made to him by the three
boys.
<P>

65   	The children were aged between 9 and 11 years at the time
of these events and it may be that it was considered inappropriate
to interview
them on more than one occasion about the matter. There are some indications in
the handwritten notes contained in Ex
1 which suggest that those preparing the
matter for the inquiry had it in mind to call the officers from the Department
of Youth
&amp; Community Services who had interviewed the children. The
prescribed officer was not bound by the rules of evidence and it may
be that
the officer with the carriage of the matter proposed to rely on the evidence of
the District Officers in combination with
the plaintiff's admissions made to Mr
Russell during the interview conducted on 19 May 1987. 
<P>

66   	I do not find that there were statements taken in 1987/88
from the children which have been lost or destroyed. However, I
think it right
to infer that Ex 1 is not the complete Departmental file relating to the
investigation of the 1987 allegations against
the plaintiff. There are, for
example, no reports, internal memoranda or the like recording the advice and
subsequent decision to
withdraw the charge against the plaintiff. The file does
not include two letters written by the mother of SI complaining about the
plaintiff's conduct or any other contemporary account of the terms of her
complaint (or the complaint made by the mother of TH).
This is a significant
matter to which I will return. 
<P>

67   	I accept the plaintiff's account that Mr Nicholls shredded
some material said to relate to these allegations in late 1988
after the charge
had been withdrawn. The plaintiff did not inspect the material and is not able
to say what it was. The matter remains
unclear.
<P>

68   	Mr Porter submitted that the current allegations arise out
of the matters the subject of the 1987 investigation. The present
charge
includes allegations that the plaintiff touched two boys, SI and TH, on the
genital area. Mr Porter submits that these allegations
are closely associated
with the allegations the subject of the proceedings which were discontinued. He
contended either they were
investigated in 1987/88 (and the Departmental
records lost) or that they should have been since the Department was on notice
of them.

<P>

69   	To assess this submission it is necessary to look at the
evidence concerning the nature and scope of the 1987 investigation.
<P>

<b>The 1987/88 Investigation</b>
<P>

70   	On Tuesday 19 May 1987, Bob Russell, Principal of the
Broken bay School, was contacted by Paul Lester and advised that complaints
had
been received concerning the plaintiff. Paul Lester was a teacher at Blaxland
Primary School. At about 6.35pm Mr Russell confronted
the plaintiff in his
office and took him through the allegations. It seems reasonable to assume that
Mr Russell put to the plaintiff
each of the allegations of which he had been
notified. His record of the interview with the plaintiff suggests that those
were as
follows:
<P>

&#183;	Massaging children in Magpie Lodge on the back, front and bottoms (the
plaintiff appears to have admitted massages to the
fronts and backs of children
but denied massages to the bottoms).
<P>

&#183;	Getting into bed with the children in the mornings and giving them
cuddles (the plaintiff appears to have agreed to this).
<P>

&#183;	Making unsavoury comments about penis size when the children were
showering or changing (the plaintiff appears to have denied
this).
<P>

&#183;	Wrestling with children in his own room on the bed (the plaintiff
appears to have agreed to this).
<P>

&#183;	Exposing himself to children from around the corner while he was taking
a shower (the plaintiff denied this).
<P>

71   	It is to be noted that as at the evening of Tuesday 19 May
1987 Mr Russell does not appear to have been put on notice by Mr
Lester of any
allegation that the massaging of the children had included in any instance
explicit touching of the child on the penis
or scrotum. 
<P>

72   	Mr R Steuart, District Officer attached to the Department
of Community Services Ryde Office, prepared a report dated 25 June
1987 in
which he recorded the results of his interviews with RH, LS and a child SF
concerning their observations of the plaintiff
at the Broken Bay Camp. Mr
Steuart details in that report that a child at risk notification had been
received at the Ryde Office
on 26 May 1987. In the introductory remarks to his
report he outlines the background including the allegations made against the
plaintiff.
The account of the allegations is consistent with those put to the
plaintiff by Mr Russell on 19 May. From this I infer that as at
26 May 1987
(when the child at risk notification was made) there was no allegation that the
plaintiff had touched any child on the
penis or scrotum.
<P>

73   	Mr Steuart's report contains the following account of the
interviews with RH, LS and SF:
<P>

"[A]bout 7.00am on Tuesday, 19.5.87, Mr Singleton had gotten into bed with him,
as RH was homesick and had been crying. Mr Singleton
had allegedly hugged RH
and told him that everything would be alright, and if he needed comforting, he
could come and see Mr Singleton
in his room. RH stated that he did not feel
uncomfortable about Mr Singleton's actions, and felt better afterwards. At the
time that
this incident allegedly took place, there were other boys in the
dormitory getting dressed in preparation for the day's activities.
RH stated
clearly that there was no other incident between himself and Mr Singleton.
...
<P>

[LS] advised that Mr Singleton had offered to massage the boys' backs and he,
in fact, had had his back massaged by Mr Singleton.
LS did not consider that
this was inappropriate at the time, and felt quite comfortable about this.
<P>

[SF advised he was not] approached by Mr Singleton in any inappropriate
manner."
<P>

   
<P>

74   	A report prepared by Mr Cauchi, District Officer, Bondi
Office of the Department of Youth &amp; Community Services, on 16
June 1987
records his interviews with the parents of the children MD, LS, CO and BK.  He
notes that:
<P>

"The parents consistently said that their sons complained of four things:
<P>

(1)   	there was a beach but we were not allowed to swim, 
<P>

(2) 	the food, 
<P>

(3) 	there was a tennis court we couldn't use, 
<P>

(4) 	there was a weird teacher there."
<P>

Mr Cauchi went on to note that no parent regarded the incident as being treated
very seriously by any of their sons.  The incident
is a reference to the
plaintiff's offer to give the boys a massage and to the fact that he did
massage the necks of the boys LS,
CO and BK.  He is said to have asked if the
boys would like a massage of their back and bottom but all refused.  
<P>

75   	Reports were prepared by Mr Job, District Officer, Manly
Office of the Department of Community Services, as to interviews
conducted by
him with the children AZ, SW, DW and DO in May of 1987:  
<P>

&#183;	AZ said that the plaintiff had massaged him on the back and rubbed him
on the bottom a little, partly pulling down his pyjamas.
 AZ was asked if the
plaintiff had touched his penis and he denied that.  
<P>

&#183;	SW said that the plaintiff had massaged his back and pulled his pyjama
pants down at the back and massaged his bottom.  The
plaintiff had lain on the
bed with SW and placed his hand on his shoulder.  
<P>

&#183;	DW said that the plaintiff had asked if he would like a massage but he
had said no.  The following morning the plaintiff
had got into DW's bed.  He
had his clothes on.  DW moved to the other side of the bed without saying
anything and the plaintiff got
out of bed.  
<P>

&#183;	DO said that the plaintiff had massaged him on the back.  He had not
touched him on the bottom or anywhere else. 
<P>

76   	It is notable that among such contemporaneous records as
exist of the accounts given by children at the Magpie Lodge in May
of 1987
though a number described massages and inappropriate behaviour such as lying on
the bed with children, none reported overt
sexual contact. 
<P>

77   	A handwritten memorandum forming part of Ex 1, which I
take to have been made some time prior to the decision to withdraw
the charge
in December 1988, queries  "Have interviews taken place with H/I from Blaxland
Primary?". This is a reference to SI and
TH. It is clear from this that at the
time of the initial investigation the Department was on notice that SI and TH
were students
who had attended the Broken Bay School and who should be
interviewed.
<P>

78   	The mother of TH, in a statement made in November 1998,
says that she spoke with Ken Cleary, School Principal, at the time
(May 1987).
No record of the terms of her complaint forms part of the Departmental file.
Her recollection as at November 1998 of
the terms of her son's complaint was
that the plaintiff had hugged him and asked him if he liked to be tickled and
that the plaintiff
had touched him over his body, under his pyjamas and fondled
him.  
<P>

79   	TH in his statement made in July 1998 describes the
plaintiff asking him if he liked to be tickled.  He goes on to give an
account
that the plaintiff put his hand down the front of his pyjamas under the waist
band of the pyjama pants.  He says that the
plaintiff touched his penis,
holding it in his hand.  The plaintiff rubbed his penis in his fingers slowly
and gently for a few seconds
and asked if it felt okay or whether he liked it.

<P>

80   	Fourteen months earlier, on 16 May 1997, TH was
interviewed by Mr Kennedy.  On that occasion TH's recollection of the assault
appears to have been less precise:
<P>

"PS cuddled TH in bed and handled him on the genitals.  TH cannot remember the
details but has no doubt that the action occurred,
was purposeful on the part
of PS and was not just a `slip of his hand'."
<P>

81   	SI, in a statement made in July 1998, gives an account of
the plaintiff massaging him under his pyjama top as he lay on his
back.  He
says that the plaintiff slipped his hand under the front of his pyjama pants
and moved it, palm downwards, across the front
of the thigh at the top of his
leg and across his penis and scrotum.  As he moved his hand upward he lifted it
to slide it across
the penis and scrotum touching them lightly and then moving
his hand back down the top of the thigh.  
<P>

82   	When SI was interviewed on 13 May 1997 by Mr Kennedy he is
not recorded as alleging that the plaintiff touched him on his
penis or
scrotum. Relevantly Mr Kennedy records him as saying:
<P>

"PS would come around at night and offer to massage students - shoulders and
chest area - in their bed. He would ask if you wanted
your abdomen massaged -
he would then massage a bit low and make you feel uncomfortable.  ...  SI
remembers PS asking, referring
to the massage, "Do you want me to go down your
shorts as well?". 
<P>

There no account of the assault which is the subject of the incident
particularised in paragraph 1(1)(d) of the charge in Mr Kennedy's
report of his
interview with SI. 
<P>

83   	SI's mother, in a statement made in July 1988, says that
on the day her son returned from camp he complained to her of the
plaintiff
"stroking his thighs and genital area".  She subsequently contacted Paul Lester
and "informed him that something had happened
at the camp".  She also spoke
with the Principal of Blaxland High, Ken Cleary.  No record of her complaint to
either of those Departmental
officers forms part of the file. 
<P>

84   	Paul Lester was interviewed by Mr Kennedy on 12 May 1997.
The notes of that interview record him as giving this account:
<P>

"During one of these shower supervisions PL was talking generally to some
students. During the conversation he was advised that
during a time when the
students were a bit rowdy PS had come out in the nude to settle them down. This
was totally out of character
for camp supervisors and would be considered
inappropriate. He also heard from the students that PS would do massages on
children
who were sore after their activities. PL noted that the students
talked quite freely about this, were not concerned and didn't seem
to see it as
`unacceptable'."
<P>

The notes of the interview go on to recount that Mr Lester informed the school
principal who immediately took action to have the
plaintiff leave the camp.
After he returned from the camp Mr Lester recalled that a number of parents had
contacted him to express
concerns. SI's mother was one. There is no reference
in the notes of the interview with Mr Lester to suggest that SI's mother
complained
that the plaintiff had sexually assaulted her son (in the sense of
touching his penis and scrotum) although it is clear she was troubled
about the
plaintiff's behaviour. 
<P>

85   	Mr Kennedy interviewed SI's father on 6 May 1987. The
father, JI,  is a staff welfare officer in the employ of the Department.
He
recalled that after SI returned from camp, he (JI) received telephone calls
from other concerned parents. This was conveyed to
Paul Lester. The concerns
from parents and rumours led to police involvement. JI asked his son what had
happened. SI said he did
not know/nothing happened. Paul Lester visited the
homes of many parents to reassure them. There was a meeting of all parents to
discuss their concerns but JI was unable to go. 
<P>

86   	JI told Mr Kennedy that his wife had rung George Comino.
He told her that the plaintiff had admitted certain things, been
counselled and
deemed suitable to return to school.   
<P>

87   	The only contemporaneous record as to the complaints made
by either of the parents of TH or SI appears to be the handwritten
notation on
the undated file note headed, "Note" which queries, "Have interviews taken
place with TH/SI".  Adjacent to SI's name
the following appears:  "Mrs I. 2
Letters - groin area rubbed".  I infer this note was written by a Departmental
officer in the course
of preparing the matter for the prescribed officer's
inquiry. The page has a subheading "admissions" and sets out in a summary way
the admissions which the plaintiff had made in his interview with Mr Russell.
It is located with other handwritten notes made on
13 October 1988 when it is
clear that the matter was being prepared for hearing. I think it reasonable to
infer from this note that
SI's mother had written two letters to the Department
concerning this matter. 
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's claim as to unfairness</b>
<P>

88   	I turn now to deal with the question of whether because of
the delay in bringing the charge against the plaintiff he has been
deprived of
the opportunity to have a fair determination now made with respect to it. I
accept that the plaintiff now has no recall
of the relevant events. He had
given detailed instructions to his solicitors prior to December 1988 when the
matter was the focus
of his attention. Those instructions have been destroyed.
From late 1988 there was no reason for the plaintiff to turn his mind to
the
allegations made about him at Magpie Lodge. The plaintiff cannot recall what
was contained in the instructions he supplied to
his solicitor. In any
explanation furnished to the second defendant pursuant to cl15(2)(a) of the
Regulation the plaintiff can now
do no more than make a general denial. I
accept that the loss of the plaintiff's contemporary account occasions him
actual prejudice
in any defence to the charge now brought. However, the extent
of it is difficult to gauge. I note that as at 25 January 1988 when
the
plaintiff's solicitors responded by letter to the allegations set out in the
initial disciplinary charge the plaintiff did not
have a recall of the
individual students.      
<P>

89   	While contemporaneous statements made by the various
students have not been shown to have been lost or destroyed, I accept
that some
documents forming part of Ex 1 (or contained in a separate file) relating to
the investigation and the initial (withdrawn)
charge have been lost or
destroyed. Included among these are the internal memoranda or reports
recommending the withdrawal of the
original charge. It is not clear that the
loss of documents in this class serves to deprive the plaintiff of an
opportunity to fairly
answer the allegations against him.
<P>

90   	Mr Porter submitted, against the background of the
admitted inappropriate conduct engaged in by the plaintiff, room might
be
thought to exist, after the lapse of years, for the complainants to have
engaged in some level of unconscious reconstruction of
events. There is force
to this submission. It underlines the significance of the contemporaneous
accounts of the terms of complaint
reported by the parents of SI and TH. 
<P>

91   	The second defendant is invited, in submissions advanced
by the third defendant (set out in Ex 2), to accept the statements
of TH and SI
as reliable upon this basis:
<P>

"The statements of SI and TH were made as adults.  They refer to incidents
which occurred when they were children.  The information
supplied is consistent
with the information which they supplied to their parents at the time.  In the
circumstances, no inference
should be drawn that they have provided misleading
information."
<P>

92   	The fact is that no contemporaneous account exists of the
terms of any complaint made by TH or SI. With respect to the complaint
made by
SI his parents' present recollections appear at odds. SI's mother recalls that
her son did complain at the time that the
plaintiff had stroked his genital
area. SI's father says he questioned his son at the time and that SI denied any
improper contact
by the plaintiff. Given that both SI's mother and father were
concerned about the plaintiff's conduct at the time it is surprising
that the
mother does not appear to have relayed the terms of the son's complaint to her
husband.
<P>

93   	A notable feature of the 1987 investigation is that
although both SI's mother and TH's mother made complaints there is nothing
to
suggest that in 1987/88 those charged with the investigation understood that
the allegations included that the plaintiff had touched
either boy on the
penis. The letters written by SI's mother concerning this matter have been lost
or destroyed. 
<P>

94   	In <b>Walton</b> it was noted that the members of the
Court of Appeal had found, or assumed, that, notwithstanding the lengthy delay,
it would be
possible for the Tribunal, by taking appropriate steps during the
proceedings, to afford the respondents a fair hearing.  When one
turns to the
judgments in <b>Gill v Walton </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 190</a> it appears that this was,
in part, for the reason that there remained extensive documentation concerning
the regime at the Chelmsford
Private Hospital including the patients' medical
records.  
<P>

95   	In the present case there is a paucity of documentation
concerning the allegations made against the plaintiff. Further, the
second
defendant's decision to proceed pursuant to cl 15(2)(a) of the Regulation
deprives the plaintiff of the safeguards to which
reference is made in
<b>Walton</b>. 
<P>

96   	I note that Kirby P (as he then was) was highly critical
of the determination to proceed against the plaintiff in <b>Matkevich</b> upon
a review of the papers (rather than by way of the holding of an inquiry),
although his Honour concurred with the majority that
the determination so to do
was open to the prescribed officer. The facts in the present case seem to me to
point even more strongly
in favour of a determination to proceed by way of
inquiry than those in <b>Matkevich</b>. Here the gravamen of the charge brought
against the plaintiff is that he sexually assaulted two primary school age boys
under his
care. They are serious allegations involving disputed matters of fact
about events which occurred 12 years ago. They arise in the
context of the
plaintiff who has at all times admitted conduct which by present standards of
proper behaviour for teachers was inappropriate
and such as to give rise to
misinterpretation by the children and their parents. The second defendant
proposes to resolve difficult
issues of credit upon a review of the written
materials.
<P>

97   	Has the lapse of years and the loss of contemporaneous
documentation led to a situation where the plaintiff cannot now have
the
benefit of a fair determination? I think it has. At a time close to these
events the Department conducted an investigation. It
was on notice of the
complaints made concerning SI and TH.  For whatever reason the boys were not
interviewed at the time. No record
is preserved of the terms of their parents'
complaints made both to Paul Lester and to Ken Cleary nor have SI's mother's
letters
been kept. It appears that responsible officers within the Department
were satisified that the plaintiff's conduct did not involve
the sexual assault
of the children under his care. Twelve years later the third defendant relies
on statements made by SI and TH
as adults as to events which occurred when they
were nine years of age. It is clear that at the time the plaintiff's conduct
was
the source of concern among a number of parents of children attending the
Broken Bay School. A meeting was organised to air these
concerns. Against this
background of what SI's father described as concerns from parents and rumours
there is room for the memories
of the two complainants to have become
unconsciously distorted.
<P>

98   	On the material contained in Ex 2 neither SI or TH appear
to have recalled the detail of any sexual assault as at June 1997
(although it
is plain that in their view the plaintiff's conduct was highly suspicious).
Their statements made in July 1998 in which
both describe frank sexual assaults
need to be evaluated in that light. It may be that Mr Kennedy's notes of his
June 1997 discussions
with the two are inadequate or that his interview was
cursory. These are not matters which can be determined upon a mere review of
the written materials. If the second defendant, mindful of the difficulty posed
by these issues, were to determine, after reviewing
the written materials, to
hold an inquiry, would that cure the problem? I do not think it would. The
challenge the plaintiff makes
to the accounts given by SI and TH is that over
the years they have come to view his inappropriate behaviour as involving a
sexual
assault. This does not involve a challenge to their honesty but to the
accuracy of their recollections of events that occurred when
they were children
and which over the years may have been coloured by rumours. 
<P>

99   	The loss of any contemporary record of the terms of the
complaints made by the parents of SI and TH is in this context of
considerable
significance.  This is all the more so when it is remembered that SI's mother
complained to Paul Lester. Mr Lester was
interviewed by Mr Kennedy in May 1997.
At that time while able to recall in general terms the matter that caused him
to refer the
plaintiff's conduct to Mr Russell (see paragraph 84 above) it
would appear he did not recollect the terms of any complaint made to
him by
SI's mother. Generally, Mr Lester's recall of the incident now appears
imperfect. He believed that the plaintiff had been
confronted on 12 or 13 May
(this was mid way through the first camp). The date on which Mr Lester was
first advised by SI's mother
of a complaint concerning her son and the terms of
that complaint are of matters of some moment. No diary note or other record
exists
of the terms of any complaint made by the mothers of SI and TH to Ken
Cleary. After the passage of more than twelve years it would
be surprising if
he had an independent recollection of the same.
<P>

100   	I consider the loss of the contemporary documents setting
out the terms of the complaints said to have been made by SI and
TH, and the
loss of the recollection of potential witnesses such as Paul Lester and Ken
Cleary, together with the plaintiff's lost
instructions in combination produce
a result that the plaintiff cannot receive a fair determination of the charge
so belatedly brought
against him.
<P>

101   	It flows from this that the plaintiff has made good his
claim for relief.
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's claim of oppression </b>
<P>

102   	I should also note that I would have granted the
plaintiff the relief  he seeks upon the alternative basis, namely, that
the
continuance of the disciplinary proceedings is unjustifiably oppressive. In
<b>Walton </b>the majority observed that the concept of abuse of process
requires some adjustment in order to reflect that the jurisdiction of the
Medical Tribunal is protective in character. Their Honours went on to note
that, in the context of the Tribunal's powers to permanently
remove a medical
practitioner from the Register and to impose a substantial fine, there was an
analogy between abuse of the court's
process in relation to criminal
proceedings and abuse of the Tribunal's process in relation to disciplinary
proceedings. The question
of whether proceedings should be stayed on abuse of
process grounds is to be determined by a weighing of considerations similar to
those which bear on the question of whether criminal proceedings should be
stayed. In deciding whether disciplinary proceedings should
be stayed
consideration is necessarily given to the protective nature of the proceedings
(p.395-396). In this case the important
public interest in the protection of
children from the risk of abuse must be taken into account. 
<P>

103   	In <b>Walton </b>it was accepted that the Court of Appeal
had been right to have regard to the principle which informs the rule against
double jeopardy
in concluding that the plaintiffs were exposed to unjustifiable
oppression by the continuance of the proceedings. There had been
no full
hearing on the merits in that case nor did the complaints preferred against the
doctors exactly mirror the earlier complaints
which had been the subject of the
stay granted in <b>Herron v McGregor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 246.</a>  The feature of
oppression identified in <b>Walton v Gardiner</b> arose from the 1986 decision
of the Court of Appeal to stay disciplinary proceedings followed, as it was, by
a Royal Commission and
the attempt to prefer disciplinary charges arising out
of the same subject matter five years after the grant of that stay.  
<P>

104   	In the present case, as in <b>Walton</b>, the substance
of the complaint as amended on 2 March 1999 corresponds to a large extent with
the substance of the complaint of 4
January 1988. In coming to this conclusion
I have regard to the fact that the Department was on notice of the complaints
made concerning
SI and TH at the time. 
<P>

105   	There is no evidence from the defendants as to the reason
the 1988 charges were withdrawn. The only evidence led in the defendants'
case
in this regard was from Mr Jardine who it was clear could cast no light on the
matter. Yet it appears the defendants could have
led evidence on this issue.
Annexure "A" to the affidavit of Mr Jardine lists the persons contacted by Mr
Kennedy during the course
of his re-investigation of this matter. Those persons
include Mr Harrison, the ex Director of Personnel who appears to have made
the
decision to withdraw the charge, Mr Horton, the officer who was handling the
file and who advised the plaintiff's solicitors
of the planned withdrawal of
proceedings, and Mr Comino who counselled the plaintiff over the matter. It is
to be noted that a number
of the matters particularised in the 1988 charge were
not in issue. The plaintiff had admitted to as much in his interview with Mr
Russell. On the plaintiff's account his behaviour though misguided was not
sexual. I infer that in 1988 the responsible officers
within the Department
accepted the plaintiff's explanation and, accordingly, decided that the
appropriate course was to counsel him
and allow him to resume his career.
<P>

106   	The evidence is that the plaintiff changed his behaviour
in consequence of this episode. He was directed not to have physical
contact
with children and he appears to have acted upon this. He has performed his
duties creditably for the past decade. After the
interval of so many years to
bring a fresh charge raising essentially the same allegations seems to me to
amount to that form of
unjustifiable oppression which Deane J referred to in
<b>Jago </b>in the passage cited in paragraph 52 above. 
<P>

107   	The defendants do not cavil with the fact that the
plaintiff has carried out his teaching duties in the intervening years
without
giving rise to further complaint.  This takes some of the force out of the
submission that in the balancing process the public
interest concerns outweigh
considerations of oppression arising out of the revival of a charge withdrawn
by the responsible authority
eleven years ago.
<P>

108   	I am of the opinion that this case falls within the
exceptional class of case where the continuation of the disciplinary
charge
arising out of events at Magpie Lodge in May 1987 is unjustifiably oppressive
and that the weighing of the considerations
of fairness to the plaintiff
against the public interest favours granting the plaintiff the relief which he
seeks.
<P>

109   	My orders are:
<P>

1.	The second defendant be permanently restrained from dealing with the charge
of breach of discipline contrary to s 83(f) of the
<b>Teaching Services Act</b>
1980 set out in the Notice of Charge dated 10 July 1998 and amended on 2 March
1999 and signed by the third defendant.
<P>

	
<P>

2.	The third defendant be permanently restrained from prosecuting the charge of
breach of discipline contrary to s 83(f) of the
<b>Teaching Services Act</b>
1980 set out in the Notice of Charge dated 10 July 1998 and amended on 2 March
1999 and signed by the third defendant.
<P>

3.	All proceedings pertaining to the prosecution of the charge of breach of
discipline contrary to s 83(f) of the <b>Teaching Services Act</b> 1980
contained in Notice of Charge 10 July 1998 as amended on 2 March 1999 signed by
the third defendant be permanently stayed.
<P>

	
<P>

4.	The defendants pay the plaintiff's costs as agreed or assessed. 
<P>
