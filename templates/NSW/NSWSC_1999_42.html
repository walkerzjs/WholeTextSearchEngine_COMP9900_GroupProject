DECISION: 
<P>

See paragraphs 13 - 19
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	Application is made by the plaintiff for leave to appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> M
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>.  I refer to the judgment which I have given
dismissing an appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> L of the Act.
<P>

2	In his reasons for determination, the cost assessor said that he did not
intend to endeavour to set out the alleged facts and
circumstances relating to
or surrounding the agreement said to have been made between the solicitors.  He
said it was sufficient
to say that statutory declarations, which he identified,
had been made.  He then referred to the statutory declarations and to
correspondence
which had passed between the cost assessor and the solicitors
representing the parties before him.  Relevantly, the cost assessor
went on to
say:  "I express the view that I prefer the evidence and explanations of the
applicant solicitors as being the more probable
in all of the circumstances of
this case".
<P>

3	He then went on to determine that the applicant solicitors were entitled to
recover an amount which he assessed for their costs,
and he attached to his
reasons a certificate as to the amount payable.
<P>

4	Counsel for the plaintiff in the present proceedings has informed the court,
in the course of his submissions, that any appeal
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> M would not
challenge the quantification of costs certified by the cost assessor but would
be limited to the factual issue as to
whether the alleged agreement, to which I
referred in my earlier judgment, was or was not made.
<P>

5	It is material, in my view, to note that the issue proffered by the plaintiff
does not involve the quantification of costs.
<P>

6	I now refer  to the correspondence consisting of the letters of 16 September
and 19 September 1994.  In the letter of 16 September,
Mr Connolly said:
<P>

	"We note you will continue acting for Neil Macdonald, the second defendant, in
these proceedings on the basis that if Neil Macdonald's
claim against C E Heath
Underwriting &amp; Insurance (Australia) Pty Limited is unsuccessful your firm
will not seek to recover from
Neil Macdonald or our client, the fees already or
later incurred by you in the conduct of this matter."
<P>

7	The letter is prefaced by a reference to the writer's conference with Mr
Benjafield on 13 September.  Mr Connolly went on to refer
to a qualification in
relation to counsel's fees.
<P>

8	In the letter of 19 September 1994, Mr Benjafield acknowledged receipt of the
letter of 16 September.  He said:
<P>

	"We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 16 September 1994 and conform
most of the details as set out".
<P>

(I read the word "conform" as intended to be "confirm".)
<P>

9	He then went on to refer to the matter of counsel's fees.
<P>

10	I recognise that Mr Benjafield's confirmation related to "most of the
details" set out in the letter of 16 September.  Nonetheless,
the
correspondence was relevant evidentiary material, particularly in proceedings
which were not bound by the rules of evidence.
 I am left with a feeling of
serious disquiet as to whether the cost assessor took that correspondence into
account and gave it the
consideration which was required.
<P>

11	Having regard to the two matters to which I have referred, namely, the
nature of the issue proffered in the proposed appeal and
the September 1994
correspondence, I find that this is an appropriate case in which to grant leave
to appeal, and leave is accordingly
granted.
<P>

12	I note that the defendant, as in the case of the plaintiff, does not intend
to challenge the quantification of costs by the cost
assessor.  I also note
that the plaintiff has filed the evidence on which he intends to rely on the
hearing of the appeal. I make
the following orders:
<P>

13	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants costs of the appeal pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> L.
<P>

14	I order that the costs of the application for leave to appeal pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> M be costs in the appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> M.
<P>

15	The proceedings are transferred to the holding list with an estimate of one
half to one day.
<P>

16	Plaintiff to file and serve any further amended summons by 4 pm on 10
February 1999.
<P>

17	Defendants to file and serve affidavits by 4 pm on 17 February 1999.
<P>

18	Plaintiff to file and serve any affidavits in reply by 4 pm on 24 February
1999.
<P>

19	Liberty to apply on two days notice.
<P>

I note for the record that the hearing of the application for leave to appeal
occupied approximately 50 minutes of court time today.
