<b>4363/98 - DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION V CHOICE DESIGN HOMES PTY
LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   The plaintiff, as the second substituted petitioning
creditor, seeks to wind up the defendant in insolvency.  The initial summons
was filed on 22 October 1998 by a creditor that appears since to have been
paid.  Accordingly, if an order for winding up is made
in this matter the
effective date for assessing preferences et cetera will be 22 October 1998.
<P>

2	On 12 May 1999, the defendant company went into voluntary administration and
Mr R G Tolcher, a registered liquidator, became the
administrator.
<P>

3	The company, through its administrator, seeks an adjournment for fourteen
days of the hearing of this petition so that it can
hold a meeting of creditors
for the purpose of considering whether the company should enter into a deed of
arrangement.  It must
follow that the alternative must also be a possibility,
that is, the creditors will reject the deed of arrangement and will force
the
company into a voluntary winding up with Mr Tolcher as liquidator, the
effective date for relation back purposes being 12 May
1999.
<P>

4	Last week I dealt with a similar application and, in view of the fact that it
was only for a week, I granted it. Today far more
material has been placed
before me.  Last week there was no question of anything serious happening
during the adjournment; this week
there is the distinct possibility that a
resolution might be passed by creditors which may affect the plaintiff.
<P>

5	Although s 435A of the Corporations Law appears to set out a general policy
that if a company can be salvaged then all reasonable
attempts should be made
for salvation, s 440A(2), which is directed to the situation where a company is
under administration but
there is a pending winding up summons, puts the onus
on the company and its administrators to satisfy the court that it is in the
interests of the company's creditors for the administration to continue.
<P>

6	As a rule of thumb, in these sort of matters, I have been applying a fourfold
guideline.  As I indicated in the converse situation
to the present in <b>Re
Intag International Ltd &amp; The Corporations Law </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/571.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 571</a>, the
court should ask itself four questions in order, viz:  (1)  Is the company
insolvent?   (2)  Is the company salvageable?  (3)
 Is the proposed salvation
in the interests of creditors?  and (4)  Is the proposed salvation in the
public interest?
<P>

7	I indicated to counsel I would be applying those guidelines in this case, but
questions arose as to whether that was legitimate.
<P>

8	 Section 440A(2) focuses on the "interests of the company's creditors".  What
does that mean?  Mr Aldridge, who appeared for the
plaintiff, said that the
interests of the creditors meant not only the creditors' financial interests in
this particular winding
up, but also the interests of all decent traders,
including creditors.  He put that good business principles should be observed,
so that it was not in the interests of creditors that a company should go back
into the marketplace and trade whilst insolvent or,
indeed, that a director of
rogue capacity, as the plaintiff would have me infer is the situation in this
case, should continue to
trade in the same cavalier fashion as he has
heretofore.
<P>

9	It is difficult to see how the interests of creditors do extend that far.
In<b> Re Data Homes Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 NSWLR 22</a>, the Court of Appeal
indicated that when considering schemes of arrangement the court need look at
two matters; viz (a) the interests
of creditors; and (b) the public
interest.
<P>

10	The judgment of Mason JA tends to compartmentalize these two interests.  It
is hard then to see how the public interest actually
comes into the phrase "the
interests of creditors", and it is also noteworthy that s 440A(2) is expressed
in mandatory language;
that is the court is to adjourn the hearing if satisfied
that the administration is in the interests of creditors and presumably
no
other interests are relevant.
<P>

11	However, it does seem to me that Mr Aldridge is correct up to the point that
it cannot be in the interests of creditors that
there be a scheme propounded
which is unlikely to fulfil its promise, or that the company spend considerable
sums in legal and accounting
fees in defending the scheme against attacks by
dissentients, which attacks may have a very good chance of succeeding because
this
further depletes the pool of assets that is to be available for the
payment of the unsecured creditors.
<P>

12	Accordingly, my fourfold guideline I believe is a legitimate way of
approaching the matter.  There are guidelines and there will
be cases where the
facts will show some other method of approach will be preferable.
<P>

13	The other problem about s 440A(2) is the enquiry whether the administration
generally is in the interests of creditors, or the
administration for the
period of the adjournment is in the interests of creditors.  I think it is the
second and Santow J seems to
have proceeded in that direction in<b> Waste
Recycling and Processing Services of NSW v Local Government Recycling
Co-operative</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/507.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 507</a> at para 6, and indeed I probably
subconsciously followed the second principle last week in the present case.
<P>

14	However, as something significant could happen in the next period of
adjournment, the question really aligns into whether the
company has satisfied
the onus that the administration should continue.
<P>

15	As to this, in<b> Fullview v WLW Pty Ltd</b> Parkinson JR, 17 September
1997, unreported, the learned Judicial Registrar approached similar question by
posing the test, "Is there
even a mere possibility of a greater return to
creditors under administration than under a winding up?"  Part of the reason he
said
that was that the application was made at an early stage before the second
meeting of creditors and before all the facts were available.
<P>

16	With respect to the learned Judicial Registrar, that has not been the way in
which the matter has generally been approached.
 In<b> Creevey v Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19 ACSR 456</a>, 457;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20ATR%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">32 ATR 632</a>, 633,
McPherson JA, giving the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal, said that
the question was whether there was some persuasive
evidence to enable the court
to see that the creditors could hope to get more from liquidation or
administration.
<P>

17	That was taken up by Santow J in this Court in<b> Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation v Yates Security Services Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 16 ACLC 448</a>, 451 and
the<b> Waste Recycling</b> <b>case</b> at para 6.
<P>

18	In the latter case his Honour said:
<P>

"There must be a sufficient possibility, as distinct from mere optimistic
speculation, that such a deferment for the envisaged time
is in the interests
of creditors."
<P>

19	The way in which Santow J approached the matter in both those cases was to
consider the pros and the cons.
<P>

20	The points in favour of continuing the administration are that the creditors
are likely to get more money than otherwise.  The
proposal set out in Mr
Tolcher's affidavit of 2 June 1999 is that related parties, by which I assume
was meant the director and his
relatives, would defer all their claims, that
other creditors would in due course be paid fifty cents in the dollar, that the
company
would continue to trade and contribute $10,000 per month to pay former
creditors, which contribution would be "underwritten and personally
guaranteed"
by the company's director.
<P>

21	The administrator considers that on a liquidation the optimistic return to
creditors would be about eleven cents in the dollar
and on the pessimistic view
nil.
<P>

22	It is notable that in the light of additional facts that have been found,
mainly by the efforts of the plaintiff, the optimistic
forecast has been
reduced down from twenty-six cents in the dollar to eleven cents in the dollar
over the last week or so.
<P>

23	As against this the following matters should be considered:   (a) there
appear to be preferences in the period 22 April to 12
May of $58,000 and as
prior records are "missing" there may well be more.  These would be caught up
if the company was put into liquidation;
(b) there are some aspects of the
behaviour of the director which might in the public interest be inquired into
and may even produce
some more moneys into the pool available to the creditors;
(c) the figures which were supplied to the administrator by the director
appear
to be very questionable, both from material found from the plaintiff's auditors
and from other creditors whom the plaintiff
has contacted; (d) the date of
commencement of the winding up generally may be very significant in this case;
and (e) the proposal
would seem to involve a company going back into the
marketplace while it was insolvent and trading whilst it was insolvent because
even if there was a complete release of all the outside claims, the related
parties' claim would probably make it insolvent.  This
is both against the
public interest, see the<b> Data Homes</b> case, and conduct that is prohibited
by the statute.
<P>

24	Mr Aldridge sought to make a sixth point and that was that the conduct
generally of the director has been such that he should
not be permitted to
continue to trade with this corporate vehicle.
<P>

25	Mr Harper for the administrator objected to this evidence and to my mind it
was basically irrelevant.  One cannot say that a
person who has been guilty of
improper behaviour as a director, assuming that the director in this case has
been guilty of such conduct,
is going to pursue that behaviour in the future.
However, the point has some relevance because if this company is wound up it
may
be a ground for the regulatory authority to move to disqualify the director
from further involvement with corporations, which might
not follow from an
administration.
<P>

26	It seems to me that the factors favouring winding up outweigh the factors
for continuing under administration. Accordingly, the
administrator has not
made out his case and I will not adjourn the hearing of the winding up
application.
<P>

[His Honour then proceeded to hear the summons for winding up, ordered that the
company be wound up and appointed a liquidator]
<P>
