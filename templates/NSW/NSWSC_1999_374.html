<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is an application for an interim injunction in a
case where it is really impossible for the court to do absolute justice between
the various parties.  Under such circumstances the court just has to do the
best it can and to do what the High Court in<b> Bridgewater v Leahy</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
72 ALJR 1525</a> called "practical equity".
<P>

2	The first defendant was employed by the first plaintiff from about 28 June
1984 until 15 February 1999.  From about 1987 it would
seem he had the title
"managing director", although he was not always a member of the board of
directors.
<P>

3	The second plaintiff, Mushroom Records Pty Ltd, was associated with the first
plaintiff.  The first plaintiff was, according to
the draft statement of claim,
in the business of importation, manufacture and distribution of records,
compact discs and audio tapes
in Australia.  The second plaintiff conducted the
business of arranging for the distribution and recording of music, the entry
into
distribution licence agreements with other record companies in Australia
and overseas, and distributing such products. The first
defendant was never at
any stage employed by the second plaintiff.
<P>

4	The third defendant is a company that has an address in London and I assume
was incorporated in England.  The second defendant
is an Australian
corporation, which I assume, seeing it was represented by the same counsel as
the third defendant, is its Australian
offshoot.
<P>

5	It would appear that in 1998 the beneficial ownership of the shares in the
first plaintiff changed and the first defendant thought
that his position would
not in future be as pleasant as it theretofore had been.
<P>

6	According to the documents which are in Exhibit PX04, from about the middle
of November 1998 the first defendant made it clear
to the third defendant or
its associates, that it would be mutually beneficial for the third defendant to
terminate its relations
with the first plaintiff and for a new arrangement to
be entered into, whereby the third defendant would conduct its own operation
in
Australia, and that that operation in Australia would employ the first
defendant and his colleagues.
<P>

7	The arrangements were made between mid November 1998 and mid February 1999
and were made at a time, it would appear on the material
before me, when the
first defendant was still the "managing director" of the first plaintiff and
without the knowledge of the first
or second plaintiffs.  It was indeed only
after notices to produce were served and after collection of material from the
hard disk
of the computer used by the first defendant was technologically
examined that the extent of the first defendant's activities whilst
an employee
of the first plaintiff were revealed.
<P>

8	The first defendant put the sales pitch to the third defendant that he was
able to deliver up to ninety per cent of business,
which would in the future in
the ordinary course of things flow to the second plaintiff, into the hands of
the third defendant and
its associates.
<P>

9	All that I have said before comes from the documents in PX04 and other
evidence that I have at the moment.  Of course, it has
been untested.  It is
put before me merely to demonstrate the strength of the plaintiffs' case to see
whether the plaintiffs have
a prima facie case, as it is sometimes put an
arguable case, for the grant of an injunction.
<P>

10	It may well be that when all the documents and all the evidence is before
the court a court may come to a different view.  However,
at present there is,
to use a broad brush approach, sufficient to show that the first defendant,
whilst an employee of the first
plaintiff, and owing the first plaintiff a
fiduciary duty to be faithful, was, to use the vernacular, feathering his own
nest by
making representations that he could deliver the plaintiffs' business
into the defendants' hands.  In the due course of time the
first defendant put
an end to the contract that it had with the first plaintiff and it would seem
that that contractual arrangement
will cease on 26 April 1999.
<P>

11	On 15 February 1999, the first defendant resigned from the first plaintiff's
employment.  There was a conversation that as he
was joining a competitor there
was no desire for him to work out his notice, and it has been put that the
probable legal analysis
of that was that the contract of employment effectively
terminated by mutual consent on 15 February 1999.  I am prepared to accept
that
analysis for present purposes.  There is no allegation of any breach of
fiduciary duty by the first defendant after the termination.
<P>

12	As from, I think, 1 March 1999 the first defendant has been working with the
second defendant to set up a competitive business.
 The defendants hope that
that business will get into operation fairly soon.
<P>

13	On 19 March 1999 the plaintiffs sought interim relief in this Court by
summons filed on that day.  The matter came into the list
on 24, 25 and 26
March and was stood over to today for the interlocutory hearing.
<P>

14	In the meantime, the defendants filed motions to have the proceedings
cross-vested to the Supreme Court of Victoria.  Those motions
came before me on
31 March and, for the reasons I then gave, I declined to make orders at that
stage, but stood the motion over until
after the interlocutory hearing.  I was
informed, however, during that hearing that if the Supreme Court of Victoria
considered that
the matter was one which should be expedited that the final
hearing could take place within three months.
<P>

15	I have approached the present application on the basis that the matter will
be transferred to the Supreme Court of Victoria and
that it probably will be
heard within three  months.
<P>

16	If the matter were to be retained here then, depending on a series of
factors, it could be heard in the last week of April or
the first week of May,
but that depends on when the parties can be prepared, the length of the hearing
and a series of other factors.
 However, I will proceed on the basis that the
matter will go to Victoria and that it can be heard there within three months,
even
though it may be that when the final decision is given on the notice of
motion some other decision is reached.
<P>

17	When working out whether to grant an interlocutory injunction the court
looks at three matters; (a) whether there is an arguable
case; (b) whether
damages are an adequate remedy; and (c) where the balance of convenience
lies.
<P>

18	Dealing with each of those three matters, as to (a), Mr Hutley SC and Mr
Dicker, who appeared for the plaintiffs, say that when
one looks through the
material in PX04 one can see plainly that the first defendant had specialised
knowledge of the relationship
between the plaintiffs and their various clients,
who are under certain contracts with the second plaintiff as set out in PX02
and
PX03; the first defendant went out of his way to contact the third
defendant, using, in some cases, the letterhead of the first or
second
plaintiff to get his message across;  and that he deliberately broke his duty
of fidelity and undermined the plaintiffs' business
by delivering it into the
hands of the  second and third defendants.
<P>

19	Mr Magee QC, who appeared with Mr Michael McDonald for the first defendant,
said that one cannot look at this case in a broad
brush way.  First one has to
be very careful to distinguish between the first plaintiff and the second
plaintiff.  There was no contract
of employment with the second plaintiff, the
fiduciary duties as pleaded were duties which arose out of the contract, and
are duties
which were owed to the first plaintiff; the alleged breach and real
damage is going to happen to the second plaintiff, and on it's
case, as pleaded
in the statement of claim, that is as far as one need go to show that there is
no arguable case.
<P>

20	As to that, at least on an interlocutory basis, the short answer is Lord
Cottenham's golden rule in<b> Wallworth v Holt</b> (1841) 4 My &amp; Cr 619; 41
ER 238, that is, that the Court of Equity makes sure that in changing ways of
doing business the essential
nature of fiduciary relationships remains the
same.  Although in<b> Wallworth v Holt</b> the problem was the change over from
a partnership structure to company structure under deeds of settlement, the
same principle applies
where one changes from a simple corporate structure to a
corporate structure with divisions.  A Court of Equity is never thwarted
by the
intervention of separate corporate vehicles to arrange people's affairs.
<P>

21	Also as far as the contract is concerned, whilst privity is a doctrine of
Common Law, there are cases in Equity where in that
sort of situation a
fiduciary duty can arise between "A" and "C" even though the contract is
between "A" and "B".  Whilst fiduciary
duties may arise from contract, that is
not their only service.  I would not have considered that on an interlocutory
basis the point
as to who was the actual employer is one which shows that the
plaintiffs do not have an arguable case.
<P>

22	Mr Magee QC then says that one has to look at this case analytically.  The
plaintiffs put it forward as a springboard case, that
is a case where because
of the alleged unconscionable conduct of the defendants if a court of Equity
does not grant an injunction
the defendants will obtain a commercial advantage
unconscionably.  The way in which the court prevents such unconscionable
conduct
is to grant an injunction for a time, so that the advantage of stealing
a march on the opposition is nullified.
<P>

23	Mr Magee QC asks what real springboard effect is there by what has happened
in this particular case?   It is alleged, Mr Magee
QC says, that the second and
third defendants have obtained benefits, but he questions what the benefits
really are because there
are contracts made by the plaintiffs with the people
named in the schedule to the summons; there is no attempt to interfere with
those particular contracts, and if there was any attempt it would be clear that
an injunction would lie, or that damages would follow.
<P>

24	Then he says, as far as the personnel that are employed by either of the
plaintiffs, whom it is alleged the defendants are poaching,
what are the rights
that the plaintiffs have to retain the benefit of their services?  They can be
offered better employment and
there is no right in the plaintiffs that is being
infringed.  The plaintiffs have no particular benefit in the custom of the
people
who have made contracts with them over and above the benefit that is
guaranteed to them under the contracts.  How can it therefore
be a case where
there is any springboard effect at all?
<P>

25	With great respect,  I believe that that is putting the matter too
technically.  When one looks to the real commercial heart
of this matter Mr
Murphy, the first defendant, was of the view that his future did not lie with
the plaintiffs after the change of
ownership.  He knew commercially he had
something to sell.  He considered that he would be able to convince someone
else in the same
line of commerce that he could attract the business to that
someone else.  He approached the second and third defendants.  The second
and
third defendants also lived in the real world and knew that that would be a
commercial benefit to them, and even though at first
they were not attracted to
do a deal with the first defendant, they soon saw where the commercial benefits
lay and performed the
marriage.
<P>

26	It seems to me that by taking advantage of the infidelity of the first
defendant the second and third defendants got themselves
into a position in the
Australian market where they could exploit the artists and repertoire available
here in a way that they would
not have been able to do if the arrangement had
not been made with Mr Murphy while he was still owing a fiduciary duty to the
plaintiffs.
<P>

27	This undermining, to use the words of Mr Hutley SC, took place from about
the middle of November 1998 through to February 1999.
 If it had not occurred
the defendants would have started three months further back in time than they
are in fact.  This would seem
to me to indicate that there is an arguable case
of at least three months for the springboard effect to be neutralised.
<P>

28	I say at least three months because although my current thinking on the
present material is that mid November to 15 February
is three months, nothing
could have been done to prevent any activity of Mr Murphy after 15 February.
It may be argued on the final
hearing that it is too topical  a view to equate
those three months with the period of the springboard, but at the moment I
think
that the three months is probably the period, and although it would be up
to this Court, or some other court if the matter cannot
be heard by 15 May, to
extend the period, it is only necessary for me at the moment to decide whether
there is an arguable case for
the next month or so.
<P>

29	As to this, Mr Bannon SC and Mr Studdy, who appeared for the second and
third defendants, say that Equity never worries about
very short periods.  The
word "never" in that submission overstates the position though generally
speaking it is right. Equity has
its guidelines, but each case must be
considered in its context as to whether the court will give relief or not.  At
the moment it
seems to me that there is an arguable case for an injunction up
until and including 15 May 1999.
<P>

30	I then pass to consideration (b), whether damages are an adequate remedy.  I
thought for quite a while that they were.  The reason
is that if one looks at
the evidence the plaintiffs can work out fairly well what is the quantum of
their trade and they can work
out from the sales of records and associated
products just which contracts bring in which profits.  If the defendants have
the benefit
of a three or six or nine or twelve months springboard and the
defendants keep proper accounts then it should be within the competence
of any
reasonably proficient judicial officer to work out the damages.
<P>

31	However, Mr Hutley SC convinced me that this was not the case.  He pointed
to the fact that the contracts and the relationships
in the present case are
rather special.  The importance was the relationship, and it may very well be
the case that something that
happened within the three month period might not
bear fruit for quite some time into the future.
<P>

32	Accordingly, it would be very difficult indeed to work out what damages
occurred as a result of the breach of fiduciary duty.
 As to that Mr Magee QC
said, "So what? It is often difficult for plaintiffs to prove what damages
flow, but why should that mean
that the plaintiffs get an advantage over the
defendants by getting an injunction?"  The reply to that is, of course, that it
is
the prima facie wrongdoing of the defendants that has brought all this
about, so why should the plaintiffs suffer by having a case
where they may very
well not be able to prove the full amount of their damages, yet they will be
commercially prejudiced.
<P>

33	Mr Bannon SC then said the injunction that is being sought is one which is
not really able to be policed and is in such broad
terms as would virtually
paralyse the defendants from doing anything.  In particular, the injunction
sought in para 1 of the amended
summons prevents contact with various people
"for the purpose of entering into a Proscribed Contract" (the words "Proscribed
Contract"
are defined in the amended summons).
<P>

34	Although this point mainly falls within category (c), it is also relevant
here because if the plaintiffs succeed at the trial
and if a valuable contract
comes about as a result of an advantage which the defendants have got for
themselves, it will be very
difficult to work out what damages follow.
<P>

35	Thus, after initially being of a different view, it does seem to me that Mr
Hutley SC is right and damages could not be properly
calculated and are not an
adequate remedy.
<P>

36	Accordingly, the case must stand or fall under heading (c), balance of
convenience.
<P>

37	On the one hand, the plaintiffs are in the situation where they have an
arguable case and they could suffer irreparable damage
if, as the first
defendant boasted, seventy to ninety percent of their business could be
abstracted.  However, it must be remembered
that after 15 February, because
there was no restraint of trade clause in the contract, that unless some other
arguments of the plaintiffs'
in their statement of claim succeed at the trial,
the first defendant could have done that anyhow after 15 February and that it
was
only his activities before that date that can ground an injunction.
<P>

38	Secondly, the first defendant is in a position where he is earning
considerable moneys with the second and third defendants;
he has been in the
record industry for many years; he knows no other trade, and his position may
be in jeopardy if an injunction
is granted.
<P>

39	Thirdly, the situation is that I am really only considering an injunction up
to 15 May, and that is a fairly short period.  It
is doubtful whether the
defendants can do much damage in that time anyhow and the court leans against
granting an injunction for
a short period of time.
<P>

40	Fourthly, it is difficult to police this sort of injunction, especially when
an injunction, such as order 1, is put in such general
terms.
<P>

41	I have taken all these matters into account, plus all the incidental matters
put in submissions.  I am troubled to an extent
with the generality of the
orders, but I am reminded in this sort of case that often the court grants a
complete blanket ban on employees
from competing for a limited period just
because it is difficult to restrain any particular activity, and there are so
many avenues
for people outflanking injunctions granted in a very strict
form.
<P>

42	I said at the beginning of these reasons that it is very difficult to do
complete justice in this case and it is necessary for
me to do the very best I
can.
<P>

43	The very best I can, after hearing all the arguments, is upon the plaintiffs
by their counsel giving to the court the usual undertaking
as to damages I make
order 1 in the amended summons omitting the words "for the purpose of entering
into a Proscribed Contract",
and I make orders 2 and 3 up to and including 15
May 1999.
<P>

44	The costs of the application are costs in the cause.
<P>

	COUNSEL ADDRESSED ON THE APPLICATION TO CROSS-VEST
<P>

45	My view is that the balance of justice favours this matter going to the
Supreme Court of Victoria essentially because the witnesses
and the documents
are in Melbourne; the case has little connection with Sydney and whilst I am of
the view that either this Court
or the Supreme Court of Victoria would probably
reach the same conclusion, and probably deal with the case with equal
efficiency,
those factors mean this should go to Melbourne, rather than stay in
Sydney.
<P>

46	The thing that does concern me a little, but I am glad to say Mr Bannon SC
is not concerned about it to any material extent,
is that if any further
interlocutory application has to be made in the next few weeks it would be
difficult for a judge in Melbourne
to have a full set of the papers, but as
that does not concern the defendants I suppose it should not overly concern
anybody else.
<P>

47	I order that the matter be transferred to the Supreme Court of Victoria.
<P>

	                                            oOo.
