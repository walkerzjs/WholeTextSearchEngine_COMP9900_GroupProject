<b>JUDGMENT (Defendant's Application to Amend Defence of Justification &amp;
Plaintiff's Application to Set Aside Defendant's Subpoena
to New South Wales
Police Service)</b>
<P>

1   	By Notice of Motion, filed in Court on 22 March 1999, the
defendant seeks leave to file a "<i>Third Further Amended Defence"</i> (MFI 1)
to the "<i>Third Further Amended Statement of Claim"</i> in the 1995 action and
a "<i>Further Amended Defence</i>" (MFI 2) to the <i>"Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim"</i> in the 1996 action.  The defendant further seeks leave
to rely on the particulars of justification contained in paragraphs 5 to 21
of
what is described as the "<i>Second Consolidated Particulars of Truth</i>"
(Exhibit R) served on 12 March 1999 as amended by letters from the defendant's
solicitors to the plaintiff's solicitors dated 17
March 1999 (Exhibit S).
<P>

2   	On 25 February 1999 the jury found that the 1995 program
("<i>Today Tonight") </i>carried the following imputations defamatory of the
plaintiff:
<P>

<i>"1(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with boys who were under the
age of 18 knowing them to be under the age of 18.</i>
<P>

<i>3(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with a 15 year old boy who was
then under the influence of drugs which had been given
to him by the
plaintiff".</i>
<P>

3   	The jury found that the 1996 program ("<i>Witness"</i>)
carried the following imputations defamatory of the plaintiff:
<P>

<i>"1(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old boys, having
deliberately refrained from asking those boys how old
they were.</i>
<P>

<i>2(a)	The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old male
prostitutes having deliberately refrained from asking them how
old they
were".</i>
<P>

4   	By its proposed <i>Third Further Amended Defence to the
Third Further Amended Statement of Claim</i> the defendant pleads defences
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i>.  The contextual
imputations are:
<P>

<i>"7(1) ...</i>
<P>

<i>(A)	the plaintiff engaged teenage boys who were under the age of 18 and were
working as prostitutes for the purpose of having homosexual
intercourse with
them;</i>
<P>

<i>(B)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual
intercourse with boys who were under the age of 18, with reckless
indifference
as to whether they were under the age of 18;</i>
<P>

<i>(C)	the plaintiff committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with teenage boys who were under the age of 18
years;</i>
<P>

<i>(D)	the plaintiff has committed a criminal offence by having sexual
intercourse with a male prostitute who was a 15 year old boy knowing
him to be
under the age of 18.</i>
<P>

<i>(E)	the plaintiff has committed a criminal offence by having sexual
intercourse with a male prostitute who was a 15 year old boy with
reckless
indifference as to whether he was under the age of 18.</i>
<P>

<i>(F)	the plaintiff has committed a criminal offence by having sexual
intercourse with a male prostitute who was a 15 year old boy".</i>
<P>

5   	By its proposed <i>Further Amended Defence to the Second
Further Amended Statement of Claim</i> (MFI 2), the same defences are pleaded
and the contextual imputations are:
<P>

<i>"7(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>(A)	the plaintiff engaged teenage boys who were under the age of 18 and were
working as prostitutes for the purpose of having homosexual
intercourse with
them;</i>
<P>

<i>(B)	the plaintiff committed offences by engaging in homosexual intercourse
with teenage boys who were under the age of 18 and who
at the time were working
as prostitutes;</i>
<P>

<i>(C)	the plaintiff committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with teenage boys who were under the age of 18
years;</i>
<P>

<i>(D)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with boys who were under the age of 16, knowing
them to be under
the age of 16;</i>
<P>

<i>(E)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with boys who were under the age of 16, with
reckless indifference
as to whether they were under the age of 16;</i>
<P>

<i>(F)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with boys who were under the age of 16;</i>
<P>

<i>(G)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with male prostitutes who were 15 years of
age, knowing them to be
under the age of 16;</i>
<P>

<i>(H)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with male prostitutes who were 15 years of
age, with reckless
indifference as to whether they were 15 years of age;</i>
<P>

<i>(I)	the plaintiff has committed criminal offences by engaging in homosexual
intercourse with male prostitutes who were 15 years of
age".</i>
<P>

6   	The Notice of Motion to Amend filed on 22 March superseded
Notices of Motion filed in each action seeking similar relief on
12 February
1999.  The last mentioned Notices of Motion filed for the defendant were
concerned with leave to amend in respect of
D13 to D16.  The subject Notice of
Motion deals with all amendments sought including D17 to D25. 
<P>

7   	Two Notices of Motion were filed by the plaintiff on 7 May
1999.  These Motions seek to have disallowed what are described
as "<i>those
amended particulars of truth which are underlined in a copy of the defendant's
Particulars of Truth filed on 18 February 1999</i>".  These Notices of Motion
were filed as a precautionary measure in the following circumstances:  by
judgments dated 9 February 1999
(DLJT: 2 &amp; DJLT: 3) I ruled as to the
availability of imputations to go to the jury.  Consequently, in the 1995
action, the defendant
filed a "<i>Second Further Amended Defence</i>" to a
"<i>Second Further Amended Statement of Claim"</i> on 18 February appending the
particulars the subject of the relevant Notice of Motion of 7 May.  In the 1996
action, on 18 February
1999, the defendant filed an "<i>Amended Defence</i>" to
a "<i>Further Amended Statement of Claim</i>" appending the particulars the
subject of the relevant Notice of Motion of 7 May.
<P>

8   	The focus of the defendant's present Application to Amend
pursuant to the Notice of Motion filed on 22 March, shortly stated,
is an
entitlement to rely upon cases arising from D17 to D25.  There are other
amendments sought in respect of D1 to D16 the allowance
of which will be
embraced in any formal order granting leave. 
<P>

9   	The plaintiff's Notice of Motion to Set Aside the
defendant's Subpoena of 18 January 1999 to the NSW Police Service was filed
in
Court on 12 March.  The context is:  the defendant's proposed amendments in
relation to D17 to D25 are founded in documents produced
by the Police Service
purportedly in compliance with that subpoena of 18 January 1999.
<P>

10   	The Amendment and the Subpoena Applications were heard
together.  The proceedings formally commenced on 22 March 1999 (T409)
when Mr
Nicholas Q.C. opened the defendant's case on its Application.  I reserved my
decision on both Motions on Tuesday 1 June.
 Extensive and detailed written
submissions were delivered and oral submissions were heard over the period 17
May 1999 to 1 June
1999.
<P>

11   	The defendant's application is pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 20</a> rr
1(1) and (2): "<i>(1)  The Court may, at any stage of any proceedings, on
application by any party of its own motion, order that any document in the
proceedings be amened, or that any party have leave to amend any document in
the proceedings, in either case in such manner as the
Court thinks fit.  (2)
All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real
questions raised by or otherwise
depending on the proceedings, or of correcting
any defect or error in any proceedings, or of avoiding multiplicity of
proceedings"</i>.  It is clear that the power conferred has a remedial purpose
for the attainment of justice.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff advances 17 grounds in opposition.  Several
of them are connected to the subpoena issue.  One ground, the plaintiff's
psychiatric condition, has been elevated to the level whereat it is submitted
that should the defendant otherwise be entitled to
amend, leave should be
refused by reason of that condition.  Thus, I shall determine the question of
leave to amend generally, then
the psychiatric component and the subpoena
component.
<P>

13   	For the defendant it is contended that the principles
recognised in <b><i>The State of Queensland &amp; Ors v J L Holdings Pty
Limited </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146</a> show that "<i>justice"</i> is the paramount
consideration.  Amendments which may be a complete answer should be allowed
unless the result is irremediable injustice
to the plaintiff. Furthermore, and
importantly for the defendant, "<i>injustice</i>" is to be distinguished from
"<i>prejudice</i>".  Prejudice may be averted by appropriate orders and
directions as to the future conduct of the matter.  For this case to be tried
on its merits the amendment should be allowed to enable the defendant to be
afforded a fair hearing on its "<i>full</i>" case.  The Court's power is to
ensure that the real questions raised by the proceedings be fairly determined
and the rights of the
parties decided.
<P>

14   	In <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> (a case founded essentially
upon its peculiar circumstances), the majority (Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ)
at 152, having referred
to the applicant's explaining their delay in applying
for leave to amend on the basis that the relevant material was only
"<i>recently discovered</i>", cited the important passage from the judgment of
Bowen LJ in <b><i>Cropper v Smith</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%2026%20Ch%20D%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 26 Ch D 700</a> at 701:
<P>

<i>"Now, I think it is a well established principle that the object of Courts
is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish
them for mistakes
they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in
accordance with their rights. Speaking for
myself, and in conformity with what
I have heard laid down by the other division of the Court of Appeal and by
myself as a member
of it, I know of no kind of error or mistake which,
</i><cite>if not fraudulent or intended to overreach</cite><i>, the Court ought
not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the other party. Courts
do not exist for the sake of discipline,
but for the sake of deciding matters
in controversy, and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or of
grace"</i> (emphasis added).
<P>

15   	As to "<i>intended to overreach</i>", it was submitted for
the defendant that this means no more than that which was involved in the
amendment demonstrates "<i>mala fides</i>".  Some support for this proposition
was said to be found in the dictionary definitions in the Macquarie Dictionary
("<i>deceit"</i>) and the Oxford Dictionary ("<i>cunning</i>").  Mr Barker Q.C.
produced from his library a dictionary by Dr Ogilvie (1879) with a definition:
"<i>to reach ... too far</i>" (it also includes "<i>cheating</i>"). References
to dictionaries all point to the word "<i>overreach</i>" having the central
meaning of "<i>reaching"</i> or "<i>straining excessively"</i> and when used of
another person mean "<i>defeating that person by the straining"</i>, in which
context, the meaning to be attributed to this second component of the
disjunctive from Bowen LJ is "<i>intending to obtain a result beyond what was
legitimate to cause frustration of the suit"</i>.  The conduct described as a
"<i>overreaching"</i> must be <i>"intentional</i>".  The critical issue is
whether that which constitutes the proposed amendment amounts to
"<i>overreaching"</i> in the sense described.
<P>

16   	The majority in <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> in analysing
the decision of the Full Federal Court referred to that Court's reference to
<b><i>Clough &amp; Rogers v Frog</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%2048%20ALJR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 48 ALJR 481</a> and to the decision
of the High Court in <b><i>Sali v SPC Limited </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2067%20ALJR%20841" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 67 ALJR 841</a> at 849
stating with respect to the latter (at 154):
<P>

<i>"It may be said at once that in the passage which we have cited from
<b>Sali v SPC Ltd</b> Toohey and Gaudron JJ are not to be taken as  sanctioning
any departure from the principles established in <b>Cropper  v Smith </b>and
accepted in <b>Clough &amp; Rogers v Frog. Sali v SPC Ltd</b> was  a case
concerning the refusal of an adjournment in relation to which the proper
principles of case management may have a particular
relevance.  However,
nothing in that case suggests that those principles might be employed,
</i><cite>except perhaps in extreme circumstances</cite><i>, to shut a party
out from litigating an issue which is fairly arguable.  Case management is not
an end in itself. It is an important
and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and
efficient disposal of litigation.  But it ought always to be borne in mind,
even in changing
times, that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of
justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant
that
aim"</i> (emphasis added).
<P>

17   	Their Honours, in the context of the amendments being
considered by the primary judge in <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> went on to state
(at 154-155):
<P>

<i>"The purpose of the amendment was, according to the applicants, merely to
avoid taking JLH by surprise.  But if the amendment sought
does raise a new
defence and not merely a matter which JLH is required to prove in any event, it
constitutes a substantial, if not
complete, answer to JLH's claim.  If it is
arguable, the applicants should be permitted to argue it, provided that any
prejudice
to JLH might be compensated by costs.  No doubt prejudice to JLH may
also be averted, as Carr J in dissent in the court below pointed
out, by
appropriate orders expediting such procedures as the parties might seek to
employ as a result of the amendment.</i>
<P>

<i>The majority in the Full Court considered that costs are not these days
considered the "healing medicine" they once were. They referred
to the speech
of Lord Griffiths in <b>Ketteman v Hansel Properties Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%201%20AC%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 1 AC
189</a> and the decision of this Court in <b>The Commonwealth v Verwayen </b>(1990)
170 CLR 394.  In <b>Ketteman</b> Lord Griffiths said: </i>
<P>

<i>"justice cannot always be measured in terms of money and in my view a judge
is entitled to weigh in the balance the </i><cite>strain the litigation
imposes</cite><i> on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants
rather than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new
issues, the raising of false hopes ..."</i> (emphasis added).
<P>

<i>In this case, which is of a commercial nature, the litigants are on the one
side a developer and on the other side government, and
there is nothing which
would indicate any personal strain which would justify the conclusion that
costs are not an adequate remedy
for prejudice caused by the amendment sought
to the pleadings...</i>
<P>

<i>Justice is the paramount consideration in determining an application such as
the one in question.  Save in so far as costs may be
awarded against the party
seeking the amendment, such an application is not the occasion for the
punishment of a party for its mistake
or for its delay in making the
application.  Case management, involving as it does the efficiency of the
procedures of the court,
was in this case a relevant consideration.  But it
should not have been allowed to prevail over the injustice of shutting the
applicants
out from raising an arguable defence, thus precluding the
determination of an issue between the parties".</i>
<P>

18   	Particular emphasis was placed upon the exception in
respect of "<i>extreme circumstances</i>" referred to in the first extract
above.  The circumstances of the present application, the defendant contends,
cannot be considered
"<i>extreme</i>". 
<P>

19   	Much of what was said by Kirby J in <b><i>J L
Holdings</i></b> was cited by counsel for the defendant particularly the
passages (at 161-3):
<P>

<i>"In dissent, Carr J agreed that refusal of the amendment would cause
serious injustice to the applicants. He invoked the remark of
Griffith CJ in
<b>Rowe v Australian United Steam Navigation Co Ltd:</b></i>
<P>

<i>`[T]he right of every man to a fair hearing before he is condemned lies at
the root of the tree of justice.'</i>
<P>

<i>Carr J referred to the broad language and remedial purpose of the  power of
amendment expressed in O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules.
 He insisted that
case management was but a means to the end of the attainment of justice. Taking
efficiency into account did not
oblige a court to give "decisive weight" to
that factor.  What was decisive remained the assessment of where justice lay in
the particular
case.  This abiding requirement had survived the consideration
of efficiency and public interest as, indeed, Lord Griffiths had acknowledged
in <b>Ketteman</b> when he said:</i>
<P>

<i>`Whether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion of
the trial judge and he should be guided in the exercise
of the discretion by
his assessment of where justice lies.  Many and diverse factors will bear upon
the exercise of this discretion.'"</i>
<P>

20   	Counsel referred to Kirby J's statement of relevant
considerations in the approach to pleading amendments commencing at 167,
particularly paragraphs 5 to 7 at 169-172:
<P>

<i>"5. 	Amongst considerations which may tend to favour the extension of an
indulgence to a party applying for it are the following:
 that this is the only
way in which the true issues and the real merits, factual and legal, can be
litigated and artificiality avoided;
 that the oversight which occurred is
adequately explained as, for example, that it arose out of sudden and
unexpected events; </i><cite>that the proposed amendment is of considerable
importance to the rights of a party, particularly where it provides a complete
answer
to a claim</cite><i>;  that any fault is that of the party's legal
representatives;  that the oversight was wholly accidental; that it was simply
the
product of unavoidable human error or, possibly, the outcome of the
application to the case of fresh legal minds who perceived an
important new
point; that cost orders or the imposition of other conditions could adequately
rebalance the competing claims to justice;
 and that the hearing date is
sufficiently in the future to permit a party to meet the amendment, taking into
account any consequences
for the gathering of fresh evidence, the conduct of
discovery or like pre-trial procedures and the loss of assigned hearing
dates...</i>
<P>

<i>6. 	Considerations which tend to argue against the grant of an indulgence
include many which are the counterparts of the foregoing.
 Thus, the failure of
a party to offer anything by way of explanation for a late application has been
held relevant. So has the blamelessness
of the resisting party and the extent
to which the applicant is at fault in its breach of clear directions.
</i><cite>Courts now take into account the strain which litigation may place
upon those involved</cite><i> and the natural desire of most litigants to be
freed, as quickly as possible, from the anxiety, distraction and disruption
which
litigation causes.  In my view this is not a consideration limited to
litigation by natural persons or involving private citizens.
 Because justice
cannot be measured solely in monetary terms, costs orders are not  necessarily
an adequate balm to the other party.
 Thus, the proximity of the hearing is
clearly a most important consideration.  An opposing party is entitled to have
taken into
account the consequences of an indulgence, especially where it would
cause disarray at the last minute to its preparation of the
trial.  Similarly,
the length of time that the proceedings have been pending before the
application is made will often be a relevant
consideration.  The longer the
time, the more reasonable it may be to expect  that the parties, or their
lawyers, should have earlier
 appreciated, and raised, the point in issue. If a
consequence of the indulgence is truly a necessity to postpone a trial date,
this
will be a most important consideration. Its importance increases with the
congestion of court  lists and the difficulty, particularly
in the case of a
lengthy trial, of securing early replacement dates.  The extent to which a new
issue would give rise to a substantial
and new case in reply is also relevant.
So may be the nature of the  litigation and whether it has been assigned to a
special list
 designed to cater for the peculiarities and special needs of
commercial cases, long trials and the like.  Writers on effective case
management repeatedly stress the importance of  adhering to a "firm, credible
... trial date" as an important element in securing
the serious attention to a
dispute which may help to promote its resolution.  They call attention  to the
risks of "litigation abuse"
by which some litigants  seek, at all costs, to
avoid firm hearing times Courts are entitled to react unfavourably to repeated
default
on the part of a litigant whose conduct has the effect of frustrating a
proper timetable fixed for the trial.  Justice will not necessarily
require
that a party should have multiple opportunities to plead and present its case.
A court must accord justice to the particular
litigant. But it must also
maintain its responsible use of scarce public resources and consider, in a
general way, the impact which
its orders have on other litigants and on the
public generally.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	Whilst taking all of the considerations relevant to the circumstances of
the case into account, the judge must always be careful
to retain that
flexibility which is the hallmark of justice. New considerations for the
exercise of judicial discretion in such cases
have been identified in recent
years.  But the abiding judicial duty remains the same. A judge who ignores the
modern imperatives
of the efficient conduct of litigation may unconsciously
work an injustice on one of the parties, or litigants generally, and on
the
public.  But a judge who applies case management rules too rigidly may ignore
the fallible world in which legal disputes arise
and in which  they must be
resolved"</i> (emphasis added).
<P>

21   	Of particular importance in the defendant's submissions
was the public interest in the outcome of the proceedings and the
undoubted
flexibility attending their conduct now permitted by the amendments made in
1994 to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i> limiting the role of the jury.
<P>

22   	It is fundamental to the defendant's position, but
vigorously contested by the plaintiff, that there has been nothing to suggest
fraud or improper concealment of the defence on the part of Channel 7.  Indeed,
the factual material to which I will refer below,
the defendant contends,
exposes that upon the information coming into its hands, not only with
promptitude but with care, were the
particulars of the amendment sought
notified to the plaintiff (cf.  <b><i>Clough </i></b>at 482).
<P>

23   	The application of the principles was exemplified in the
following cases cited by Mr Nicholas Q.C.:  <b><i>Assaf &amp; Anor v Skalkos
&amp; Anor </i></b>(Levine J, unreported, 5 February 1998) pp 9-10;
<b><i>Tedeschi v Franklins Limited</i></b> (Levine J, unreported, 23 September
1994) pp 2-3;  <b><i>Meekosha &amp; Anor v Special Broadcasting Corporation
&amp; Anor </i></b>(Levine J, unreported, 18 September 1998);
<b><i>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 389</a> at 397.
<P>

24   	Particular reference was made to the decision of
Badgery-Parker J in <b><i>Jones &amp; Anor v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited
</i></b>(unreported, 10 April 1992) in which the defendant had from the
beginning pleaded defences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> but upon the matter being called
on for trial sought leave to amend its defence to particularise a thitherto
unjustified imputation.
 The defendant was in possession then of evidence
capable of establishing the truth of the imputation in question.  His Honour
said
at 5:  "<i>Prima facie, a party who makes a bona fide application to amend
to make a fresh cause of action or a new defence should be permitted
to do so,
if any prejudice to the other party can be avoided by an adjournment and/or
adequately compensated by an order for costs
or otherwise avoided or
compensated". </i> His Honour deplored the dilatoriness of the defendant in the
preparation of the matter: the defendant submits that there is no available
basis for a similar attitude here to be taken.  His Honour accepted that the
decision of the solicitors in that case not to conduct
investigations in the
Philippines was made in good faith, but went on to say that in the
"<i>specialised field of defamation when a professional media organisation is
defendant,  it cannot escape criticism for dilatoriness
or inattention to
preparation by hiding behind its solicitors.  Had the application been an
application to adjourn so that a possible
additional defences as to which had
information but not evidence might be explored, or so that witnesses could be
got to support
a defence already pleaded, I should have refused such
application without hesitation"</i> (pp 9 -10).  (Again, the defendant argues
that that finding would not be available on the evidence here.)  After
acknowledging that
there will be many cases where any application for late
amendment of defences requiring a plaintiff to deal with allegations not
previously raised in justice being refused, his Honour said that there could be
no arbitrary rule.  His Honour ultimately found that
<i>"the situation in the
present case appears to be that the defendant is able, primarily at least, to
mount a case that the second plaintiff
would not have or be entitled to the
reputation she proposes to assert before the jury... it would, in my view, be
an affront to
any notion of justice that the plaintiff should be allowed to
proceed to trial, denying that she is or was a prostitute while the
defendant
had, waiting to give evidence, witnesses to the contrary whom it was precluded
from calling.  There is a big difference
between this case and one where a
defendant is seeking time only to investigate a new allegation or locate new
witnesses in support
of an old one"</i> (pp 10-11; cf. <b><i>TCN Channel Nine
Pty Limited v Antoniadis </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 682</a> at 691D, 695B).
<P>

25   	Here it is the defendant's position that there has always
been a plea of justification, that the plea has always been focused
upon the
area of the plaintiff's conduct in relation to underage boys.  It should be
permitted to litigate a "<i>full case</i>"; it is not open to the Court in all
the circumstances to say, in effect, "<i>well, you have D1 to D16, you really
do not need D17 to D25".  </i>For the plaintiff, on the other hand, it is
submitted, that this is the very type of case referred to in the last few
sentences of
the passage cited from the judgment of Badgery-Parker J: merely
new allegations and new witnesses in support of old ones.  The disallowance
of
the amendment, the plaintiff argues, is the more compelling when it is accepted
that the plaintiff will be "<i>overreached</i>", will be psychologically
damaged and, to state it very shortly, the information founding the application
(the Police documents)
were obtained improperly after service of the subpoena
which the plaintiff seeks to set aside.
<P>

26   	The defendant contends and rightly so in my view, that the
public itself has an interest in the resolution of the merits of
a case such as
the present.  As was stated in <b><i>Associated Leisure Limited (Phonographic
Equipment Co Limited) &amp; Ors v Associated Newspapers Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%202%20QB%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970)
2 QB 450</a> at 457D per Edmund Davies LJ:  "<i>these Courts are here to administer
justice.  The concept of justice is not confined to the interests of the
particular litigants;
 it embraces and extends to the protection of the weal.
The issues involved in this litigation have an importance of direct concern
to
the community,"</i> (see also the Court of Appeal in the instant case
(unreported, 2 May 1996) at 1, 11).
<P>

27   	Public interest is an essential element of the defences
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i>. The defendant argues that
refusal of the application would preclude the litigation of matters of
legitimate concern to the public,
would be contrary to the public interest and
hence an "<i>affront</i>" to the administration of justice.  As Lord Denning MR
said in <b><i>Associated Leisure</i></b> at 455E:  "<i>I think that justice
requires that the matters alleged in this amendment should be investigated in a
Court of law.  It would, I think,
be very strange if this libel action were to
be tried next month and damages awarded on the basis that there was nothing
whatsoever
to be said against the plaintiffs:  and yet, in October, the Gaming
Board were to refuse them a certificate on the grounds that they
were not fit
and proper persons to supply and sell gaming machines.  It is in the interests
of consistency and justice that the reputation
of the plaintiffs should be
properly considered in this action, provided always, as I have said, that any
hardships to the plaintiffs
can be compensated for in money.  I think it can so
be compensated.  The defendants, in putting this plea of justification on the
record, run a very grave risk.  If it fails, the damages which might otherwise
have been modest, would be colossal," </i>(see also <b><i>Atkinson v Fitzwalter
&amp; Anor </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%201%20WLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 1 WLR 201</a> at 210E, 222H).
<P>

28   	It is fundamental to the plaintiff's opposition to the
amendment application that any "<i>usual</i>" order as to costs or adjournment
will never compensate the plaintiff for the "<i>injustice</i>" that allowance
of the amendment would bring about in terms of the <i>"overreaching</i>" of the
plaintiff in his vulnerable, psychiatric state.
<P>

29   	The defendant submits that the evidence establishes that
Superintendent Woodhouse put allegations, including D17 to D25, to
the
plaintiff on 29 January 1999 and submitted a report to the DPP in March. What
remains an open question is whether prosecution
is recommended and, if so,
which of the allegations are relevant.  It would be an affront to justice if
refusal of the application
precluded the defendant from defending the claim for
damages and the plaintiff was subsequently found guilty of conduct which the
defendant seeks to raise and prove to be true.  In this context, it is
important to keep in mind the "<i>public</i>" element of every libel action.
The plaintiff institutes proceedings to recover damages to vindicate his
reputation and the sum ultimately
awarded signals to the public the vindication
of the plaintiff's good name:  "<i>he gets damages because he was injured in
his reputation, that is simply because he was publicly defamed.  For this
reason, compensation
by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of the
plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done" (<b>Uren v
John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited </b></i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20117%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 117 CLR 118</a> per Windeyer J at
157).  Hence it is vital to ensure that any verdict obtained by the plaintiff
is the outcome of a trial on the
merits.  Conformably with the remarks of Lord
Denning MR in <b><i>Associate Leisure</i></b>  it would be wrong if, after a
trial, the plaintiff could be put before the public with his award as
vindication when it was obtained
in circumstances where the defendant had been
precluded from litigating its full defence.
<P>

30   	It must be borne in mind that the defendant has always
justified in the sense to which I have referred.  Its amendments relate
to what
are said to be incidents additional to those already particularised.  If
established at the trial one, or several in combination,
may constitute a
complete answer to the plaintiff's causes of action.
<P>

31   	By reason of the timing of the defendant's notification to
the plaintiff of the additional particulars, there has been no
delay, no
procrastination, no default on the part of the defendant which requires
"<i>indulgence</i>", it is submitted.  The particulars relating to D15 were
sent on 6 January 1999;  those relating to D13 and D14 were sent on 7 January
1999;  those relating to D16 to D23 and Messrs Pollard and Brinkworth were
contained in the document "<i>Consolidated Particulars of Truth</i>" delivered
on 18 February 1999 and the particulars relating to D24 and D25 were contained
in the further version of the <i>"Consolidated Particulars of Truth</i>"
delivered on 26 February 1999.
<P>

32   	It is also of significance, the defendant says, that the
application to amend by adding particulars in relation to D13 to
D16 was
opposed from 6 January until 3 March on which day consent was indicated subject
to the resolution of appropriate conditions.
 In relation to these components
of the amendment, no prejudice to the plaintiff is asserted.
<P>

33   	As to D17, the application is opposed, however on 21 April
the plaintiff informed the Court that the plaintiff would not be
prejudiced if
the amendment was allowed and would be able to meet the allegations.  As to D1,
D2and D6 the absence of any real or
any challenge at all to the amendments
virtually eliminates them from consideration in the overall outcome of the
application. 
<P>

34   	It is said that the evidence of Mr Angus (partner at
Mallesons Stephen Jaques) establishes that he and others on behalf of
the
defendant were ignorant of the matters in the Police statements of D17-25 until
11 February when access was gained to them and
other material produced on
subpoena by the Police.  These particulars were notified to the plaintiff's
solicitors on 18 February
in respect of D17 to D23 and on 26 February in
respect of D24 and D25.  Care has been taken in respect of those additional
issues
both prior to drafting the particulars and recently (<i>T541.20,
T929</i>) and there has been no delay.
<P>

35   	In his affidavit of 18 February, Mr Angus deposes as to
the subpoena being issued to the Police Service on 18 January in response
to
which documents were produced to the Court on 1, 4, 9, 10 and 12 February.  It
was amongst the material produced on 10 February
that the statements of D17 to
D25 and those of Messrs Pollard and Brinkworth were located:  these are Exhibit
F (formerly IRA 1).
 Until access was granted on 11 February Mr Angus was
ignorant of the identity of these people and of the allegations made
(<i>paragraphs 19-21)</i>.
<P>

36   	In his affidavit of 26 February Mr Angus deposes that on
the 5th of that month Mr Quail had obtained the names of twelve persons
and
made a handwritten list of them.  That list included D19, D20, D21 and D23;
later that day Mr Quail showed the list to Mr Bates
(a partner at Mallesons
Stephen Jaques) who caused investigations to be made as to the whereabouts of
those named persons.  Prior
to that day neither Messrs Quail, Bates nor anyone
of behalf of the defendant knew of those persons.  It is Mr Angus' evidence
that
he does not recall seeing or reading the list which was thrown away on the
5th or 6th of February by Mr Quail (<i>T553</i>).  The uncontested evidence of
Mr Angus, it is submitted, is that neither the list nor the information on it
played any part in the
formulation of the particulars (<i>T929.5</i>). 
<P>

37   	I interpolate here that I accept this evidence.  I accept
that in the whole scheme of things Mr Quail's involvement, as described
by Mr
Nicholas, is a "<i>red herring</i>".  No <b><i>Jones v Dunkel</i></b> inference
is available from the fact of Mr Quail not being called.
<P>

38   	In his affidavit of 5 March 1999 concerning D24 and D25,
Mr Angus swears that their identity was unknown to anyone until 11
February and
those names were not even on the list prepared by Mr Quail and showed by him to
Mr Bates on 5 February.  On 24 February
each of D24 and D25 provided to the
solicitors for the defendant a signed statement in relation to the matters in
the Police statements;
thus it came about that on 26 February the particulars
were amended to include their allegations.
<P>

39   	In his affidavit of 23 March relating to D6 and the
amendments to existing particulars of his allegations it appears that
on 16
March D6 and his solicitors attended a conference with the defendant's
solicitors and counsel and gave information giving rise
to amendments.  That
was the first occasion on which there was direct communication between the
solicitors for the defendant and
D6 (<i>T932</i>);  this evidence was
unchallenged.
<P>

40   	In his oral evidence Mr Angus stated that it was after he
swore his affidavit of 18 February that Mr Bates told him of the
Quail list
(<i>T508.30</i>) and that a Mr Price in the employ of the defendant's
solicitors copied the names on or about 5 February (Exhibit 6).  It was not
until about mid-March (<i>T511.45</i>) that Mr Angus saw the list;  he did not
know the names or the allegations on 5 February (<i>T834.5</i>).  The
production of the statements of D17 to D25 were a surprise to him
(<i>T520.40</i>) and as soon as the material was produced it was used to found
the amended particulars (<i>T528.25</i>).
<P>

41   	It was not until early January 1999 that pursuant to
instructions and counsel's advice he issued the subpoena on the 18th.
 The
matter had been expedited in May 1998 and fixed for hearing in September 1998.
As at the latter date a substantial number of
interlocutory procedures still
required completion (supply of particulars, the filing of a Reply and
particulars, discovery and administration
of interrogatories):  it was for that
reason that he did not turn his mind to the issue of a comprehensive subpoena
until completion
of those interlocutory steps (<i>T535.10</i>).
<P>

42   	To characterise the application to amend as occurring
extremely late or made at the trial at the "<i>eleventh hour</i>" as the
plaintiff asserts, is unwarranted, the defendant submits.  The matter was
expedited on 5 May 1998.  In September of 1998
the matters were fixed for trial
to commence on 8 February 1999 (four days being allowed by me from 1 February
1999 to tidy up loose
ends!).  At May 1998 and notwithstanding that the
defendant did not oppose the application for expedition, the Statement of Claim
was not in its final form, the Defence was not in its final form, no Reply had
been filed, no interrogatories had been administered,
no discovery had taken
place and no subpoenas, of course, had been issued.  
<P>

43   	By September the position was little different from May in
that the Statement of Claim and the imputations were not in final
form, nor was
the Defence, there had been no discovery and interrogatories had not been
administered.  As a consequence of the matter
being listed in September before
the interlocutory steps were complete the usual pre-trial matters
"<i>collided</i>" so that by the nominated trial date (8 February 1999), there
still remained complex residual interlocutory matters before the trial
could
proceed.  Indeed in the week commencing 1st of February there was still
outstanding questions as to the form of the imputations,
the ambit of the
Defence, the completeness of discovery and the adequacy of answers to
interrogatories.  The situation is in marked
contrast to what is asserted to be
the "<i>normal</i>" situation when a trial date is fixed after an
acknowledgment by both parties that all interlocutory steps have been completed
to
their satisfaction.  In this context, the "<i>lateness</i>" of the
application for leave to amend must be viewed and if viewed appropriately in
the light of the evidence, can be understood
as one, nonetheless in accordance
with principles, which must be allowed.
<P>

44   	Mr Angus saw the need for additional particulars as being
one to ensure that the best possible and all available evidence
in support of
the truth of the imputations was before the Court (<i>T538.20</i>).   The
particulars as drafted were based on signed statements to the Police
(<i>T542.35</i>) and were sent, as I have said, after scrutiny by the solicitor
for the defendant and senior and junior counsel.  Further, since
18 February
each person except D23 has confirmed the particulars in interview with the
defendant's solicitors (<i>T931.40</i>).
<P>

45   	As to D1 and D2 there was no cross-examination of Mr Angus
as to the proposed amendments which are not seriously challenged.
 The changes
such as they are (and these are set out in the most useful analysis prepared by
Mr Barker Q.C.), were made after conferences
with each in late January and
early February 1999 and after reference to documents produced on subpoena
(<i>T932</i>).
<P>

46   	It is submitted that from the evidence of Superintendent
Woodhouse it can be found that the Police material (including the
statements
upon which the particulars for D17 to D25 were based) would not have been
produced before an interview with the plaintiff
had been conducted at which the
allegations were put to him.  That interview ultimately took place on 29
January 1999.  The material
became accessible to the solicitors for the
defendant for the first time on 11 February, it was not available before then,
and Mr
Woodhouse was not cross-examined to the effect that the documents would
have been produced (that is, those that were in existence)
earlier had the
defendant issued its subpoena before 18 January.
<P>

47   	The affidavit evidence of Mr Woodhouse can be summarised
as follows.  Most of the documents required by the plaintiff's subpoena
which
had been issued in October 1998, were the subject of a claim for public
interest immunity.  Mr Woodhouse's initial attitude
to the defendant's subpoena
of 18 January was that most of the documents attracted the same claim.  On 27
January he attended a meeting
with Messrs Bell and Howard of the Police Service
solicitors and the Crown Solicitor's representative, Mr Singleton, and it was
decided
that documents including those relating to D17 to D25 should be
produced after the interview arranged for 29 January, with the plaintiff
had
taken place.  None of the material relating to D15 to D25 would have been
produced until after Mr Woodhouse had interviewed the
plaintiff and put to him
the allegations from his investigations as head of Strike Force Cori in
1998.
<P>

48   	In his affidavit of 14 April reference is made to a
meeting on 1 February with the Crown Solicitor at which he advised that
he
would produce material including that of D15 to D25.  The critical factor was
that the interview with the plaintiff had taken
place.  Annexure D to his
affidavit is the relevant policy log.  Mr Woodhouse was then prepared to
produce the material in response
to the subpoenas issued by both the plaintiff
and the defendant.
<P>

49   	In oral evidence he stated that he instructed the Crown
Solicitor on 20 January that he regarded the material concerning D15
and D16
and other complainants as subject to public interest immunity (<i>T936.55</i>).
He was however, prepared to release other material (<i>T937</i>) relating to
people not referred to in paragraph 25(c) of his affidavit of 2 March.  The
people referred to in that paragraph included
D17, D18, D19, D20, D22, D24 and
D25, D15 and D16, Messrs Pollard and Brinkworth and one other.
<P>

50   	On 20 January in response to the defendant's subpoena, Mr
Woodhouse decided that the majority of the material was subject
to public
interest immunity and contained matters to be put to the plaintiff and was part
of an ongoing inquiry (<i>T596.50</i>).
<P>

51   	On 27 January Mr Woodhouse attended a conference with
Detective Senior Constable Halcro at the offices of the Crown Solicitor
with
Messrs Bell and Howard together with Detective Superintendent Inkster and
another officer.  The purpose of the meeting was to
consider the subpoenas
served on the Police Service by both the defendant and the plaintiff.  On 27
January the position was as represented
in annexure D to his affidavit of 14
April 1999, being the policy log paragraph 80.  By 10 February (<i>T966.50</i>)
the names I have referred to as having been set out in paragraph 25(c) of the
first affidavit, were no longer the subject of ongoing
investigation.  With the
interview of the plaintiff on 29 January the investigation by Detective
Superintendent Woodhouse was effectively
finished;  all that remained was some
further checking, to receive some information from Mr Lee (the solicitor acting
for Mr Marsden
in criminal matters), and to prepare and submit a report to the
DPP (<i>T982-3</i>), which report was submitted in March (<i>T944-5</i>).
<P>

52   	Thus, the submission is made for the defendant that it is
quite plain that one is not dealing with a situation of delay in
relation to
steps that could have been taken which would have generated the production of
the information that subsequently gave
rise to the amended particulars.  It
would not and could not have been forthcoming, on the evidence, pursuant to a
subpoena issued
by either party prior to 10 February.  In other words,
circumstances entirely outside the control or interference of either the
defendant
or the plaintiff, if the plaintiff had so wished, were such that the
delay is explicable, it warrants no consideration of "<i>indulgence</i>" and
all other things being favourable, does not preclude the grant of leave.  (In
this regard, further reference was made to what
Kirby J said at 170 in <b><i>J
L Holdings</i></b> <i>(supra)</i> and to the Court of Appeal's judgment in
<b><i>Commonwealth v McLean</i></b> at 397.)
<P>

53   	The next component addressed by the defendant was the
plaintiff's <i>"situation</i>" particularly with respect to the proposed
amendments concerning D18-25.  (It is to be remembered that the plaintiff's
position in
relation to D17 is that whilst the amendment is not consented to,
subject to terms, the plaintiff would not be prejudiced by its
allowance.)
<P>

54   	It is contended for the defendant that the true position
as regards Mr Marsden is unknown, the simple explanation being that
he has
chosen not to give evidence.  All the evidence from those who represent him as
solicitors has been given on information and
belief, though none was challenged
as to his/her non-acceptance as to what was said was their client's information
conveyed to him.
<P>

55   	Mr Potter was not informed by the plaintiff or indeed
others as to relevant information obtained as to the allegations as
to D13 to
D25 either before or after 29 January.  Mr Lee however in his evidence showed
that the plaintiff had caused an analysis
of the Police material to be
undertaken to support the submissions to Mr Woodhouse for the interviews of 29
January and later, to
demonstrate that there were errors of fact,
inconsistencies and improbabilities in relation to those allegations.  By 25
February
the plaintiff was equipped, it is said, to support submissions to Mr
Woodhouse as to his innocence and that the allegations were
unreliable.  It was
left to Mr Potter however to assert prejudice in this application in
circumstances where he did not know of the
material with which Mr Lee was
concerned or of the plaintiff's activities which generated it.  Mr Potter's
evidence as to the plaintiff's
activities depended entirely on what the
plaintiff told him and the defendant contends that the plaintiff has withheld
information
from Mr Potter.
<P>

56   	Of critical importance, the defendant submits, is the
following evidence as summarised.  Mr Flynn, Barrister, gave evidence
that on
24 September 1998 he visited D17 at the plaintiff's request and did so again in
mid-October and gave advice to D17 on 30
October (<i>T353-355</i>).  He and the
plaintiff had lunch with D17 at a restaurant in Wollongong on or about  January
(<i>T361-2</i>).  Mr Flynn arranged a meeting with D17 at Kirconnell Centre by
fax on 18 January (Exhibit A) although the evidence is not clear
that Mr Flynn
was aware of the particulars in relation to D17 at that time.  He also visited
D17 on 19 January.  Mr Flynn had been
retained by Mr Potter since at least 17
November 1995 on behalf of the plaintiff to attend and take statements from all
relevant
witnesses in relation to the defamation litigation.  Mr Flynn gave
evidence on 12 March 1999 and it was only after that event that
Mr Potter knew
of the visits and lunch to which I have referred.  Mr Flynn did not report to
him on these occasions and Mr Potter
was unaware of any steps being taken
regarding D17 (<i>T1154-5</i>).  The point being made is that Mr Potter might
not have known, but the plaintiff certainly did, or so it clearly can be
inferred.
<P>

57   	Mr Lee (of Corrs Chambers Westgarth) sets out his
activities in his affidavits of 1 March 1999 (Exhibit K) and 20 April 1999.
The defendant's perception of his evidence is as follows:  Mr Potter was not
informed by Mr Lee of the existence of the documents
which are set out in the
affidavit of Mr Lee dated 1 March 1999 as annexure A (in connection with the
privilege argument)(<i>T1148-9</i>).  He was not aware of any of the documents
having been provided to Mr Woodhouse until the time he prepared the affidavit
(<i>T1157.25</i>).  Although he did not know, Mr Potter presumed that Mr Lee
and the plaintiff were investigating and gathering information as to
the
allegations after 29 January (<i>T1188.5</i>), though was ignorant of their
activities in gathering material to refute the additional allegations
(<i>T1168.40</i>).  As at 10 February, the date of his affidavit, Mr Potter was
ignorant of the extent of the exercise undertaken by Mr Lee under
the
plaintiff's instructions (<i>T1171.15, T1203.5</i>).  As at 8 March he did not
know of the documents to which Mr Lee referred in his affidavit of 20 April
(<i>T1189-90</i>) or the information and asserted errors of fact,
inconsistencies and improbabilities (<i>T1190.15</i>).  The plaintiff did not
tell Mr Potter that he had caused to be provided to Mr Lee material directed to
the allegations put to him
on 29 January or that he had caused Mr Lee to put a
submission to Mr Woodhouse identifying errors of fact, inconsistencies and
improbabilities
(<i>T1192.40</i>).  Mr Potter had not seen Mr Lee's folders of
documents and was unaware of his annotations (<i>T1193-4</i>).  For a more
detailed discussion of the steps taken by Mr Lee see my judgment of 7 May
(NSWSC 428:  DLJT: 39).  It was only very
recently that Mr Potter became aware
that in March Mr Lee had communicated with Mr Woodhouse concerning the
allegations put at the
interview (<i>T1162</i>); he was ignorant of the
existence of any material put by Mr Lee to Mr Woodhouse on either 8 or 22 March
(<i>T1162</i>).
<P>

58   	The point made from such evidence, is that it is not open
to the plaintiff with facility to assert, at the very least, discomfiture
at
the case the defendant proposes now to allege in relation particularly to D17
to D25.  The plaintiff is Mr Marsden.  The evidence
discloses that the
plaintiff certainly instructed Mr Lee in his capacity as Mr Marsden's solicitor
for criminal matters on the one
hand but kept Mr Potter in the dark on the
other.  The "<i>reservoir of knowledge"</i> as it was described in submissions
was in Mr Marsden.  He was giving different instructions to Mr Lee in relation
to one component
of his forensic business, namely the investigation by the
Police Service, but there was no communication as to those matters vis-a-vis
Mr
Potter in relation to another component of his forensic business, namely the
defamation action.  That cannot be held against the
defendant the more so when,
in essence, the subject matter of Mr Marsden's dealings with Mr Lee coincides
with substance of the proposed
amendment.
<P>

59   	The next consideration was the capacity of the plaintiff
to meet the amendments.
<P>

60   	It is submitted that continuously since December 1994 the
plaintiff has investigated and gathered information as to allegations
that he
had sexual intercourse with teenage boys and frequented the establishment known
as <i>"Costellos</i>".  The information gathering has been conducted by the
plaintiff himself, his firm, Mr Flynn and solicitors in both Corrs and Phillips
Fox.  Mr Flynn was retained from 13 March 1995 to assist the plaintiff in
taking witnesses' statements to answer the allegations
made in the first
program and from November 1995 was retained by Phillips Fox to take statements
for the purposes of the current
proceedings.  The work Mr Flynn did is set out
in Exhibit K in this application, namely his affidavit of 1 March 1999.  I have
referred
to the visits he made to D17 for the plaintiff from September 1998 to
19 February 1999.
<P>

61   	Mr Whittaker from 2 December 1994 commenced acting in
relation to what are described as the "<i>Grusovin allegations</i>" and in
mid-March 1995 the plaintiff had instructed Phillips Fox in the defamation
proceedings whilst Corrs continued to represent
him in relation to the Police
Service inquiries and the Royal Commission.  In early 1995 the plaintiff
retained lawyers employed
by his firm Marsdens to gather and prepare material
demonstrating his innocence of the Grusovin allegations and in anticipation of
any proceedings arising therefrom.  That is set out in Exhibit L, Mr
Whittaker's affidavit of 1 March 1999.
<P>

62   	Mr Lee has acted continuously since September 1998 in
relation to investigations of the plaintiff by Strike Force Cori under
Mr
Woodhouse and in relation to anticipated criminal proceedings against him as is
detailed in his affidavit of 1 March 1999, Exhibit
K, his affidavit of 20 April
and his evidence at <i>T1254, T1299</i>.
<P>

63   	Mr Potter has acted continuously since March 1995 in
relation to the defamation proceedings assisted by Ms Gillingham.
<P>

64   	As to D13 to D16, as has been stated, opposition to these
amendments was maintained to 3 March shortly before Mr Lee gave
evidence in
support of the plaintiff's claim to deny inspection of documents produced on
subpoena from the Police.  On 9 February
senior counsel for the plaintiff
submitted to the Court that refusal of the applications was justified.  It was
then put that there
was a need to investigate a wide range of matters to enable
the plaintiff to meet the allegations (that is, in relation to D13 to
D16).  Mr
Potter's affidavit sworn on 10 February was to like effect.  However the
evidence in Exhibit K, Mr Lee's affidavit of 1
March 1999 and his affidavit of
20 April are important, particularly annexure B to the latter being a letter
dated 14 October 1998
to Mr Woodhouse in response to a letter from him dated 25
September to the plaintiff, which refers particularly in its second paragraph
to the provision by Mr Woodhouse of an opportunity to Mr Marsden of responding
to issues which arose during the course of "<i>fresh</i>" allegations and
previous allegations, a letter relating to D16 (or D15), and the preparation by
Mr Lee of an extensive compendium
of material relating to this particular
complainant. Thus it is plainly established, it is said, that the plaintiff
knew of the allegations
long before the defendant did and was well able to meet
them and had marshalled information to attack them.  Certainly in early
February
1999 he had material relevant to the credit of D15 and D16 (the
defendant relies upon my judgment above cited in relation to precluding
the
defendant from inspecting material) to put to Mr Woodhouse (<i>T1268</i> and
paragraph 14 of Mr Lee's affidavit of 20 April);  the vast bulk of material
related to these (<i>T1275.55</i>).
<P>

65   	The defendant urged upon me that it may be accepted that
initial opposition to the application to amend was made by the legal
representatives on instructions from the plaintiff who, in fact, had left them
in ignorance of the true position.  History casts
doubt as to what is said to
be the <i>bona fides </i>of the plaintiff in that his true situation has never
been disclosed, by him, to the Court.  Thus, the Court should scrutinise
carefully
the evidence relied upon for the plaintiff in support of a submission
that unduly burdensome investigations would be required to
enable a response to
be made to the D18-D25 allegations.  
<P>

66   	After the allegations had been put on 29 January 199 the
opportunity was given to the plaintiff to provide to Mr Woodhouse
any material
which the plaintiff believed would be of assistance to him in refuting them
(see Mr Lee's affidavit of 20 April, paragraph
11).  Mr Lee thought that if
such material was not provided the report would be sent to the DPP not
presenting a true picture in
regard to the allegations (<i>T1263</i>).  The
purpose of providing the information was to dissuade Mr Woodhouse from
recommending prosecution to the DPP (<i>T1264</i>) by demonstrating the
weaknesses and errors in the Police material and that any prosecution was
doomed to failure (<i>T1296</i>).
<P>

67   	From early February the plaintiff actively undertook
gathering material to put to Mr Woodhouse, instructing Mr Potter on 4
February
to issue a subpoena for the criminal record of D20 (Exhibit N), having
persuaded Mr Potter of its relevance to the defamation
case (<i>T1186-8</i>);
those records were produced on 11 February, copied and provided to him.
Information was also obtained from the plaintiff's bank
to address an assertion
in D20's statement.  
<P>

68   	On 1, 5 and 11 February and 9 March Police material was
produced, copied by Phillips Fox and provided to the plaintiff.  The
statements
of D17 to D25 (being Exhibit F) were part of that material produced on 11
February (<i>T1081-5</i>; Ms Gillingham's affidavit 17 March and 10 April).
This material was provided to the plaintiff by Phillips Fox (<i>T1264</i>;  Mr
Lee's affidavit of 20 April); about this time Mr Lee informed Mr Singleton of
the Crown Solicitor's office of the plaintiff's
anxiety to provide material to
Mr Woodhouse.  This material was also relevant to the defamation actions,
particularly to the credit
of D15, D16, D20 and D22 (<i>T1267-9</i>).  
<P>

69   	On 12 February the plaintiff caused a copy of the Police
material to be delivered to Mr Lee who commenced work on it on 15
February and
it included material about D19, D20 and D22 (<i>T1267-8</i>).
<P>

70   	On 18 February Mr Potter received the defendant's
additional particulars and the D17 - D25 statements.  These he gave to the
plaintiff and later, in conference, went through each statement with him
(<i>T1183</i>).  The plaintiff had told Mr Potter that all those statements had
been put to him on 29 January (<i>T1183-4</i>).  Mr Potter however did tell the
plaintiff that when he provided the particulars to Mr Marsden he told him he
would not be involved
in investigations concerning them (<i>T1194.20</i>).  
<P>

71   	Exhibit L in the proceedings, the affidavit Mr Whittaker
of 1 March 199, a solicitor employed by Corrs, also reinforces, it
is
submitted, the availability to the plaintiff of information to enable him to
avail himself of the opportunity to meet the allegations
in discussions with Mr
Woodhouse.  
<P>

72   	At various times during February and March the plaintiff
provided Mr Lee with material (<i>T1275.10</i>);  he received instructions by
correspondence;  a very large number of telephone calls and consultations
(<i>T1274</i>).  Indeed, Mr Lee volunteered that the plaintiff did not need an
invitation to provide material after 29 January 1999 (<i>T1293.30</i>).  He had
discussions with the plaintiff about the problems with the material and the
plaintiff provided him with certain files relating
to D22 in connection with
the allegations that D22 had made in the statement being part of Exhibit F with
the intention of exposing
his unreliability (<i>T1291</i>).  By 25 February Mr
Lee had material ready to put to Mr Woodhouse and was in a position to speak to
him about the allegations and
arranged a meeting for 8 March (Mr Lee's
affidavit of 20 April paragraphs 16 and 17).
<P>

73   	The meetings of 18 and 22 March are described in Mr Lee's
affidavit of 20 April.  Mr Woodhouse gave evidence (<i>T968.35</i>) that Mr Lee
put forward documents for his client and that Mr Woodhouse was given access to
a large volume of material which included
material produced on subpoena
(<i>T988-9).</i>  Mr Woodhouse said that the material, in effect, was the
plaintiff's responses to the allegations put to him on 29 January 1999
(<i>T990.5</i>).
<P>

74   	Thus, the defendant argues, that the plaintiff was aware
of the issues in the D17 to D25 allegations of and from 29 January
and acted
promptly to collate evidence to demonstrate their falsity and to corroborate
his denials.  He was provided with copies
of the Police materials including the
particular allegations the subject of the amendment application.  The plaintiff
appreciated
the importance of presenting to Mr Woodhouse through Mr Lee
whatever information he could so as to persuade the former that the allegations
were false and that a prosecution would fail.  Equally it is clear that the
plaintiff was active in obtaining through Messrs Phillips
Fox and others and
presenting through Messrs Corrs, material for Mr Lee to put to Mr Woodhouse.
Both Mr Lee and Mr Potter established
that the plaintiff himself undertook the
work.  It thus may be inferred that the plaintiff knew of the charges,
evaluated them and
took such steps as he considered necessary in each case to
refute them.  As a matter of chronology by 25 February a week after the
defendant's intention to amend the particulars in respect of D16 to D23 was
known, the plaintiff was in a position to put submissions
to Mr Woodhouse.  The
defendant points out that the disclosure of these activities resulted from the
evidence given by Messrs Lee,
Whittaker and Flynn and that none of the
affidavits filed by the plaintiff in respect of the Motion to amend refer to
them.  Mr Potter
admitted (<i>T1192.35</i>) that Mr Marsden had not told him
that he had caused to be provided to Mr Lee material directed to the
allegations that had been
put at the interview of 29 January.
<P>

75   	By reason of the plaintiff himself not giving an
explanation to the Court by way of evidence on this application, less weight,
or indeed no weight, should be given to the evidence on information and belief
deposed to in Mr Potter's affidavits of 14 and 19
April.  This failure the
defendant says is significant.  It was a failure candidly to put before the
Court the true situation of
Mr Marsden in relation to this application, a
failure which cannot be either overlooked or underestimated.  Mr Marsden needed
to
demonstrate that his ground for opposition to the application should be
accepted with the result that this becomes an exceptional
case and the
defendant's application be refused with the effect that in the end there is no
trial on the merits.
<P>

76   	The defendant submits that it may be inferred that the
plaintiff has responded to the allegations which he deemed to require
response.
I should accept that Mr Marsden has addressed the errors and weaknesses in each
of the allegations made by D17 to D25 in
his submissions to Mr Woodhouse to the
extent that he though it was in his interest to do so.  There was no evidence
at all that
the plaintiff was unable to or did not put to Mr Woodhouse all that
he wished to put. 
<P>

77   	Thus, it is submitted, that at least from September 1998,
if not since 1995, the plaintiff has had information, including
witnesses'
statements, to enable him to deny with corroboration sex with underage boys;
to deny with corroboration that he had ever
been at Costellos and to establish
the falsity of each imputation and to meet cross-examination on that issue.
The additional particulars
raise no matter of surprise or novelty.  
<P>

78   	This last proposition is correct in the sense that it is
conformable with the substance of the allegations constituted by
the
imputations which the defendant hitherto has justified in any event.  
<P>

79   	There is no evidence, it is said, that the plaintiff is
surprised by the allegations or is unable to investigate them (this
is
seriously in issue). The defendant also submits that its particulars have been
in the plaintiff's hands since 18 February for
a period that is over twelve
weeks.  The significance of this, it is said, is the failure of the plaintiff
himself to give any evidence
on matters that would preclude proper
investigation, that witnesses have been lost to him (compare the situation at
the time of the
application for expedition), and thus bring the case within the
"<i>exceptional"</i> category.  What the defendant here submits is that there
is nothing before the Court by way of material which would support a finding
of
injustice because there would be consequentially some deprivation of
opportunity or entitlement as far as the plaintiff is concerned
to meet any one
or all of the additional particulars.  When one looks at the whole of the
plaintiff's position there is what one
would describe as a "<i>singular
gap</i>" which, in the ordinary course, the Court might expect to have been the
subject of evidence to demonstrate that degree of injustice
that would preclude
the granting of the amendments.
<P>

80   	Reliance is also placed upon my ruling (DLJT: 39) in terms
of the material available to the plaintiff having forensic value.
 Such is its
value that I precluded inspection at this stage so as not to compromise
cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses
(see paragraphs 53 to 56 of that
judgment).
<P>

81   	In the end, the plaintiff's position at its highest proves
a desire for further time to enable him to improve upon what is
said by the
defendant to be an existing capacity in terms of information available and
evidence ready to answer the new amendments.
 This is not a case of injustice
nor one of prejudice that cannot be cured and accommodated by the Court,
particularly in matters
of management.
<P>

82   	As to the time to be allowed to the plaintiff, this will
be a matter for the Court to consider with regard to the information
as to the
particulars already in the plaintiff's hand and the plaintiff's activities
between 29 January and 22 March and whether
there are matters peculiar to any
one or more components of the application which reasonably require further
investigation.  The
defendant submits that the reality is that the plaintiff
already knows the case he has to meet as to each of D17 to D25, has been
interviewed about them, has material to challenge them, has responded to
allegations made many weeks ago.  The steps suggested by
the plaintiff in an
extremely lengthy memorandum appended to the plaintiff's submissions point to
an ideal and perfect situation
which the realities both of the case and justice
can never accommodate.  The plaintiff however will have need only to
investigate
and supplement his present state of readiness and build upon the
already substantial body of material available to him for a long
time.
<P>

83   	On 21 April Mr Potter said that since 18 February 1999 he
had caused no steps to be taken to investigate the matters raised
in the
particulars.  All that had had happened was that he had arranged for the Police
material to be filed relating to each complainant.
 He had only looked at
Exhibit F containing the statements obtained by Mr Angus and said that he
accepted that until such time as
he dealt with the information at hand he could
not assert with any degree of certainty the nature and scope of the inquiries
left
to be made (<i>T1164 </i>and<i> T1167</i>).  He gave evidence as to
particular matters which might be required to be done (see affidavit of 22
March and <i>T1164-7</i>).
<P>

84   	On 27 April however, Mr Potter said that he had read all
the Police material in relation to D18 to D25 and had made notes
as to the
specific investigations for each complainant (<i>T1204.50</i>).  He had done
this on 23 and 26 April and that was in respect of the same material as was
contained in Exhibit G (<i>T1209</i> and <i>T1430-1469</i>).  Much of evidence
(<i>T1209-1242</i>) goes to a desire to corroborate the plaintiff's denials as
to Costellos and to the plaintiff's assertions as to his cars and the
interior
of his house at particular times. The defendant contends that much of the work
referred to has been done.  The plaintiff
has the benefit of his own knowledge,
of course, the work performed by Mr Lee, the material available from the
extensive Police investigation
into each allegation and other information
produced on subpoena.
<P>

85   	Exhibit G contains the material made available in relation
to D17 to D25;  it is voluminous and I do not propose to go through
it in
detail even to the extent that Mr Nicholas did (<i>T1520-1524</i>).  By
reference to the material in relation to D18 the submission is made that the
plaintiff has a "<i>flying start</i>" or certainly his solicitors do.  There
are identified a range of persons who one would expect would be entirely
independent and
in positions of authority at the Regent Hotel who would have
very recently responded to Police inquiries in to these matters thus,
at the
very least, facilitating such further inquiries as the plaintiff's solicitors
say they have to make.
<P>

86   	In weighing the factors relevant to the exercise of
discretion in an application of this kind, it is not a reasonable requirement,
the defendant submits, that time be given for the plaintiff to undertake an
investigation which leaves "<i>no stone unturned</i>" - an expression which
originated in myself.  Any litigant in any case may wish for such an
opportunity however the evidence in the
application does not prove that an
investigation of such a kind is necessary or indeed, essential for the
plaintiff to enable him
to meet the additional particulars.  It is submitted,
in the light of the material already available to him and the steps he took,
particularly in the context of the interview of 29 January and its consequences
that he is already in a sound position.  Mr Potter's
evidence does not fix the
extent of further investigations.  I interpose it hardly can.  Mr Potter
rightly refers to investigations
leading to further investigations.  On the
evidence however Mr Potter is simply unable to state with any degree of
certainty the
nature and scope of the inquiries left to be made and he can only
speak in general terms.
<P>

87   	The defendant accepts that the plaintiff should be
afforded reasonable time.  Mr Potter gave evidence in relation to the Hyde
Park
Plaza Hotel (D25) that it would be six months before any inquiry into that
component would be complete.  I do not understand
that it would take six months
of activity exclusively devoted to the Hyde Park Plaza before that component
would be attended to.
 Six months is the period within which the inquiries
would be completed in the context of inquiries on other matters also taking
place.  
<P>

88   	One must identify the circumstances and determine what
would be <i>"reasonable</i>" in the light of such findings.  In reality the
plaintiff should be provided with a reasonable opportunity to explore and
investigate
to determine whether there can be generated on a reasonably
possible basis material which would assist (not determinatively resolve)
the
issues in his favour, in meeting of the defendant's case (compare <b><i>Regina
v Alexandroaia </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2081%20A%20Crim%20R%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 81 A Crim R 286</a> at 289).  In this context, it is
to be borne in mind, the defendant submits, the evidence from Mr Woodhouse, Mr
Potter and Mr Lee
indicates that at least for the period 29 January to 22 March
the matters the subject of the contentious additional particulars certainly
have been addressed by the plaintiff.  Thus, the point is reached in
examination of the defendant's submissions that leaving to one
side the
resolution of the psychiatric evidence and the impact, if any, of the
plaintiff's application in respect of the subpoena,
the application of
principle to the evidence would inevitably lead to the conclusion that the
defendant is not seeking an indulgence
but the rightful exercise of a
discretion and a principled one to allow amendments in circumstances where the
plaintiff should be
afforded a reasonable time to meet them and can be
compensated in the usual way.  The conduct of the defendant in terms of delay
cannot be impugned in the light of the chronology; the defendant very
importantly has maintained a plea of justification from the
initiation of
proceedings and the material the subject of the amendment is not novel in its
substance though is new in its detail.
 Notwithstanding that the plaintiff has
had information in relation to it, he has the resources available to conduct
reasonable further
investigation and the whole issue can be resolved on a case
management basis, the more so in a defamation action governed by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> </i>as amended in 1994.
<P>

89   	The plaintiff perceives the application to amend by the
defendant as one wholly to transform its defence of justification
in the middle
of the trial.
<P>

90   	He identifies the proposed amendments as falling
essentially into five classes:  <i>(a) variations in the dates and places in
the particulars relating to D1, D2 and D6 </i>"<i>after the defendant realised
that the allegations were false and unsustainable;  (b) various scurrilous and
irrelevant allegations
which could not sustain a defence of justification;  (c)
allegations in relation to D13 to D16 (not in issue but subject to conditions);
(d) fresh allegations relating to D18 to D25 made as a result of new material
produced by the Police after the trial began in answer
to the subpoena of 18
January 1999;  (e) fresh allegations relating to D17".</i>
<P>

91   	On the question of principle to be applied it is submitted
that in essence the discretion is exercised by taking into account
various
considerations which militate either in favour of or against the amendment:
<b><i>J L Holdings </i></b>at 169-171 per Kirby J.
<P>

92   	Particular reference is made to the speech of Lord
Griffiths in <b><i>Ketteman</i></b> at 220E "<i>justice cannot always be
measured in terms of money and in my view, a judge is entitled to weigh in the
balance the strains the litigation
imposes on litigants particularly if they
are personal litigants rather than business corporations, the anxieties
occasioned by raising
new issues, the raising of false hopes and the legitimate
expectation that the trial will determine the issues one way or the other
...."</i>  His Lordship added that another <i>"factor</i>" that a judge must
weigh in the balance is the pressure on the Courts caused by the great increase
in litigation and the consequent
necessity that, in the interests of the whole
community, legal business should be conducted "<i>efficiently</i>".  The
principles above referred to were applied by the High Court in <b><i>The
Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen</i></b> (1990) 170 CLR 394 where (at 464)
Toohey J noted "<i>it should not be lightly assumed that the `healing medicine'
... of costs has always been a sufficient cure for the disadvantage to
the
other side".</i> His Honour thereafter (at 465) cited with approval the passage
of Lord Griffiths in <b><i>Ketteman</i></b> (see also Gaudron J at 482 and
Deane J at 448).  The important passage in <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> relied
upon is that at 155.3 where Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said "<i>in this
case, which is of a commercial nature, the litigants are on the one side a
developer and on the other side government, and
there is nothing which
</i><cite>would indicate any personal strain</cite><i> which would justify the
conclusion that costs are not an adequate remedy for prejudice caused by the
amendment sought to the pleadings"
</i>(emphasis added).
<P>

93   	The plaintiff contends that this application represents
the very epitome of a case where the personal strain which would be
caused him
if the amendment were granted, requires that the application be refused.
Seventeen factors are relied upon in opposition
to the application.
<P>

94   	The <i>first factor</i> is that the amendments are sought
to be made at trial in which regard reference is made to the comment of the
learned editors of
the ninth edition of <b><i>Gatley</i></b> at 703.1 to the
effect that the "<i>Court has shown itself reluctant to grant a defendant leave
to amend his defence where the application is made late in the day, either
at,
or close to, the trial"</i>.  Reliance was placed upon a statement of Upjohn LJ
in <b><i>Plummer v Charman </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%201%20WLR%201469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 1 WLR 1469</a> at 1473 where his Lordship
stated "... <i>a proposed amendment made at the eleventh hour must be looked at
with great particularity".</i>  Whilst as a general proposition his Lordship's
statement cannot be categorised as wrong, bearing in mind the context in which
his
Lordship made it, (an application to amend to add a dubious defence of
qualified privilege which would have completely altered the
scope of the
action) there is nothing, with respect, particularly significant in his
Lordship's observation.
<P>

95   	As Kirby J said in <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> at 170-171
"<i>the proximity of the hearing is clearly a most important
consideration</i>".  It certainly was an important consideration in <b><i>J L
Holdings</i></b> given the peculiar circumstances where an amendment was
refused six months prior to the commencement of the hearing.  In the instant
case the application was made after the commencement of the hearing, namely at
trial and, of course (even the defendant would not
gainsay this), that factor
is one which must be taken into account.  The plaintiff contends that there is
a public interest in parties
readying themselves completely well before the
hearing date.  That is so, but it is to be borne in mind that the foundation of
the
defendant's application is the late acquisition of the information giving
rise to the amendment application, notwithstanding what
might otherwise be said
about the state of the defendant's or indeed, the plaintiff's readiness (noting
in particular the plaintiff's
amendment of the imputations).  It is further
submitted that if leave to amend is given readily at a trial then this not only
causes
problems with Court administration, but also makes parties less likely
to attend to the preparation of their case at an earlier date.
 As to the
former component that is stating the obvious;  <b><i>J L Holdings </i></b>is
certainly authority for the proposition that questions of "<i>Court
administration</i>" or <i>"case management</i>" are not to predominate at the
expense of the interests of justice.  As to the latter part of the proposition,
if that risk is realised
then that is an indictment on the conduct of
litigation in this State and litigants who are parties to it will pay an
inevitable
price.
<P>

96   	The plaintiff further submits that there is an inevitable
large wastage of costs which is far more severe for the party of
less financial
strength.  On several occasions during the course of the hearing to date
statements were made about the comparative
means of the litigants.  There is
simply no evidence on this issue.  The Court, of course, is not blind to the
corporate status of
the defendant as the licensee of Channel 7 nor is it blind
to the status of Mr Marsden as a successful solicitor.  But there the
matter
must rest.  In the context of an application to amend by the defendant in which
the plaintiff vigorously asserts that he is
being "<i>overreached</i>", the
defendant's complaint that there is a complete absence of evidence in relation
to the resources, and particularly the financial
resources of the plaintiff, is
not without justification.
<P>

97   	It is further suggested in the plaintiff's written
submissions that these features make litigation even "<i>more risky for parties
who are taking on large corporations;  if the large corporations know that they
can pressurise the other party
by making late amendments this is inimical to
the administration of justice"</i>.  Without evidence this is mere rhetoric and
I reject the submission.
<P>

98   	The submission that the application is made extremely late
does state the obvious, but ignores the context to which I have
referred in the
course of outlining the defendant's submissions.  The matter was expedited on 5
May 1998 without opposition from
the defendant in circumstances where there
were outstanding interlocutory matters to be attended to.  The matter was fixed
for trial
on 8 February 1999 in September 1998.  I accept the submissions for
the defendant that, in the end, in the light of the development
of this
amendment application and the history of this litigation the hearing date of 8
February 1999 has, in effect, become academic.
 By <i>"academic</i>" I do not
mean that it is to be ignored in the whole scheme of things attending the
defendant's application, but reality demands
that it not be treated as some
<i>"focal point</i>" or <i>"benchmark</i>" against which all questions of merit
of the defendant's application are to be judged
<P>

99   	On the other hand, I accept the submissions for the
plaintiff that this is an expedited matter.  Whatever happens, Mr Marsden's
action against Channel 7 will not lose its status as an expedited matter.  If
the merits overall bring it about that the defendant
is entitled to amend, that
entitlement will be granted in the context of this case having been expedited
and appropriate management
mechanisms will be put in place and directions given
to ensure that that status, as far as reasonably and humanly possible, will
not
be lost to the plaintiff.
<P>

100   	The <i>second factor</i> is the lengthy adjournment that
is required.  It is said that prior to 29 January 1999 Mr Marsden had never
heard of D18, D19, D21,
D23, D24 and D25 or Steven Brinkworth (see Mr Potter's
affidavit of 14 April, paragraph 2).  
<P>

101   	It is said that he has conducted no investigations at all
in relation to the allegations involving D18 to D25, Mr Pollard
or Mr
Brinkworth except for a number of matters referred to in Mr Potter's affidavit
of 14 and 19 April and that of Mr Lee of 27
April.  (Apparently the plaintiff
has received an unsolicited statutory declaration from D17 and an anonymous
telephone call in relation
to D20 and another statutory declaration in relation
to D17 and, D22, of course, was a former client of the plaintiff and Mr Pollard
was a former driver.)  Mr Potter specifically asked Mr Marsden what
investigations he had made in relation to the new allegations
and was told that
the only investigation Mr Marsden has conducted were those specified in Mr
Potter's affidavit.  With this proposition
the defendant's dealt at length in
chief and in reply, particular emphasis being placed on Mr Lee's activities for
Mr Marsden in
relation to the subject matter of the allegations in the context
of the interview of 29 January and the subsequent provision of material
to Mr
Woodhouse. 
<P>

102   	The investigations and preparations which for the
plaintiff, it is submitted, would have to be undertaken in relation to
each of
D18 to D25 are set out in an appendix to the plaintiff's written submissions.
The appendix is a 34 page document in great
detail identifying what is asserted
to be the steps to be taken in relation to each of the new complainants founded
in the evidence
given during the course of the application.  I am, of course,
in no position to determine whether or not in the light of the
particularisation
of the new allegations each and every step referred to in the
appendix is necessary to ensure the preparation of the plaintiff's
case in
response.  That the plaintiff would have to make further inquiries is not in
dispute as far as the defendant is concerned:
 the question is what reasonable
time should be allowed for that purpose.
<P>

103   	There are advanced for the plaintiff a number of reasons
why an adjournment of at least six months would be required:  the
allegations
are of some antiquity being allegations relating to events occurring between
ten and twenty five years ago.  The proof
or disproof relating to such matters
involves the difficulty occasioned by the frailty of human recollection, the
difficulty in tracing
documents and witnesses and the like;  given that the
allegations relate to sexual relations between persons in private these
difficulties
are made even more acute, it is said, because in that situation
the plaintiff can only rebut the allegations by his denial and by
resorting to
proof of a variety of circumstantial matters in order to give the lie to the
evidence put against him.  There are difficulties
in attending to the gathering
of circumstantial evidence on such matters.
<P>

104   	The plaintiff has not undertaken any preparation at all
in relation to D17 - D25 (<i>T1163.30</i>) and, the plaintiff submits, there is
a large amount of time which needs to be devoted to the investigations relating
to D13 - D16.
 Although the plaintiff has agreed to the amendments involving
D13 - D16, it is stressed that the plaintiff did not come to the trial
prepared
to meet those allegations.
<P>

105   	The investigation into the City Plaza Hotel allegations
(D25) are the ones that will take at least six months in the circumstances
to
which I have referred.  Important investigations need to be conducted, it is
said:  whether it existed, whether it was a child
brothel, out all the factual
statements made by the various witnesses in relation to the Motel are to be
checked (<i>T1241.25, T1454.30</i>), as are the people in charge and who owned
the operation.
<P>

106   	Even taking into account the plaintiff's position of
denial of ever having attended Costello's, the extension of the allegations
to
prior to 1974, it is said, gives rise to a requirement in the plaintiff to
conduct further extensive inquiries (<i>T1434</i>).  In many instances, of
course, the plaintiff is involved in proving a negative and this is one of them
(that is, his non-attendance
at Costello's), and Mr Potter has been confined in
his investigations to the period 1974 to 1980. Counsel remarked that given that
Costello's and the City Plaza Hotels are apparently brothels, eye witnesses are
naturally unlikely to be cooperative.
<P>

107   	Subpoenas and Notices to Produce will have to be issued
and Mr Potter said that that more information that is received the
more
extensive the investigations are likely to become (<i>T1164</i>).
<P>

108   	Investigations have not been made into Mr Marsden's house
except insofar as they relate to allegations by D1 - D6 (<i>T1215.35</i>) and
it will be necessary to make further investigations in the light of the various
descriptions and matters raised by D18 - D25
in their statements
(<i>T1435</i>).  This will require what Mr Potter says to be the most difficult
thing, namely to rebuild separate chronologies in relation to each
allegation
involving interviewing as many people as possible who knew Mr Marsden during
the relevant period and finding those people.
 There is a need to obtain
photographs of the house for the relevant periods and details of the work
carried out during the period
and to seek corroboration as to those matters
(<i>T1436</i>).  
<P>

109   	As far as all the new complainants are concerned it is
necessary to check out all the facts in each statement to test whether
the
witness is telling the truth;  to corroborate whatever evidence the plaintiff
leads on any issue, a task not easy to carry out
in order to rebuild exactly
what happened specifically twenty or thirty years ago.  Included in this
exercise is tracing Mr Marsden's
motor vehicle ownership.  The advice of
counsel will have to be followed up by Mr Potter.  Thus, it is concluded that
the Court really
has no alternative than to adjourn the proceedings <i>sine
die</i>.  By reference to what Kirby J said in <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> at
171, the fact that a lengthy unspecified adjournment is required is a very
strong reason why the amendments in relation to D17
to D25 should not be
permitted.
<P>

110   	The defendant points to the material in Exhibit G and by
way of example, the material available in relation to D18 which
includes the
Police running sheets, two statements of D18 of 14 September and 11 November
1998, the statements of D23 of 23 December
1998 and statements of Messrs
Guarna, Rubbo, Brinkworth, Clifton, Larson and Burlin in relation to the Regent
Hotel.
<P>

111   	The plaintiff already has carried out investigations as
to the configuration of his house and ownership of his motor vehicles
and the
complaint on behalf of the plaintiff as to the extensive nature of inquiries in
relation, at least, into these two areas,
if not generally, is exaggerated
taking into account first these matters are within the plaintiff's own
knowledge, and, secondly,
the abundance of material, it is said, already
available.
<P>

112   	Further, in relation to Costello's, the plaintiff has
already had the advantage of communications with Messrs Shenkwin and
Moran,
former doormen at Costello's (<i>T1235-7</i>).  
<P>

113   	The <i>third factor</i> is the expedition of the
proceedings.  With this I have already dealt and propose to add nothing
further.  I merely note that there
has been no evidence since the time of the
application for expedition that any witnesses have died, in relation to, at
least, the
defendant's case on D1 to D16, or otherwise.  
<P>

114   	The <i>fourth factor</i> that militates, it is said,
against the grant of the application is personal stress and the <i>fifth
factor</i> is the plaintiff's psychiatric condition.  As to the former, of
course personal strain, on the authorities, is a relevant consideration.
 It
will be weighed in the scales.  With this I have already dealt in the context
of <b><i>J L Holdings, Ketteman</i></b> and <b><i>Verwayen</i></b>.  The
psychiatric factor will be dealt with separately.
<P>

115   	The <i>sixth factor, </i>the plaintiff submits,  is the
fault of the defendant in the late issue of the subpoena.  Reliance is placed
upon what was said by
Lord Denning MR in <b><i>Associated Leisure</i></b> at
456:  "<i>but when the defendant seeks to plead justification at a late stage,
his conduct will be closely inquired into.  The Court will expect
him to have
shown due diligence in making his inquiries and investigations.  The Court may
well refuse his application if he has
been guilty of delay or not made proper
inquiries earlier".</i>
<P>

116   	In context it was almost inevitable that his Lordship
would make such a remark.  One critical distinction between <b><i>Associated
Leisure</i></b> and this case is that here the defendant has always pleaded
justification.  The amendment is concerned only with the addition of
particulars of the case that has ever existed on the record.  This is not to
say that the Court would excuse delay in the sense to
which his Lordship is
referring.  But the passage cited and relied upon by the plaintiff cannot be
elevated to an authoritative pronouncement
that the Court will refuse an
application by reason merely of delay or failure to make proper inquiries even
in the context where
a plea has always been on the record.
<P>

117   	It is argued for the plaintiff that after a hearing date
was obtained on 18 September 1998 an application to issue a subpoena
to the
Police could and should have been made.  In this context reference is made to
Practice Note 51 which does not apply to defamation
actions.  Guidance however
is given as to the procedure for the issue of subpoenas in defamation actions
in <b><i>Murphy v Nationwide News Limited &amp; Anor</i></b> (Hunt J,
unreported, 26 October 1984).
<P>

118   	Fundamental to the plaintiff's position is an assertion
that the defendant knew that the Police were investigating allegations
other
than those relating to D2, D3, D5 and D6.  There were frequent communications
between the agents for the defendant and the
Police capable of indicating that
the Police told the defendant that allegations other than those pleaded were
being investigated.
<P>

119   	The defendant's position is that except as to D15 and D16
there is no evidence that the Police were investigating allegations
other than
those relating to D1 and D6.
<P>

120   	In support of his position the plaintiff relies upon
annexure B to Mr Potter's affidavit of 2 March 1999 which is a running
sheet of
Mr Woodhouse dated 2 October 1998 recording a meeting between Mr Woodhouse and
Mr Quail.  The defendant says on its face
this document does not establish that
the defendant knew that the Police were investigating allegations other than D1
to D6.  On
its face this document discloses otherwise because of the specific
reference to those complainants now identified as D15 and D16
and Mr Woodhouse
calling a halt to discussions of this matter.
<P>

121   	The plaintiff also relies upon annexure M to Mr Angus'
affidavit of 13 April 1999 being a file note recording a telephone
conversation
between him and Mr Woodhouse.  In this regard it is clear that Mr Woodhouse
made the point that he was unable to provide
any information he has obtained in
his investigations to the defendant for use in the defamation proceedings.  It
was obvious that
he had information but was not at liberty to give that out.  I
do not read this document as doing anything more than state what I
have just
recited.
<P>

122   	The plaintiff also relies upon the document behind tab 5
of Exhibit 11;  in relation to this I accept the defendant's contention
that on
its face that whilst pointing to knowledge in Mr Quail, the servant or agent of
the defendant as to investigations by the
Police, and whilst it does refer to
D1, D3 and D5 nothing in it (as at 7 September 1998) points to the defendant
having knowledge
of investigations into other persons.  It is to be noted that
Mr Woodhouse advised Mr Quail that he did not think it would be possible
whilst
criminal investigations were in progress and indeed, that it would be improper,
to indicate the nature of any additional evidence
the Police may have
discovered.  Tab 12 of Exhibit 11 is a diary note of Mr Woodhouse of a
telephone conversation advising that he
would speak only on the record to the
lawyers for Channel 7 and would only release information if it was proper to do
so.
<P>

123   	Tab 15 of the same exhibit, being a running sheet dated 8
December 1998 refers to there having been contact between Mr Quail
and D15.
Tab 16 of the same exhibit is a letter dated 8 December to Mr Angus referring
to D15 and D16 and his advice to those complainants
not to speak to the
defendant's solicitor.  The best that can be said from this material is that as
at early December the defendant
was certainly aware of investigations by the
Police into D1 to D6 and D15 and D16, that the Police had equally made it clear
that
they were not prepared to provide information otherwise than on a proper
basis.
<P>

124   	I ignore the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff
in relation to the comparative resources between the parties.  I
have already
commented on the irrelevance of this.
<P>

125   	In cross-examination Mr Angus was not able, it is said,
to provide any explanation for not issuing the subpoena before 18
January other
than he <i>"did not think of it</i>" (<i>T518.54</i>).  This is asserted for
the plaintiff "<i>not to be good enough</i>".  However, at <i>T535</i> Mr Angus
explained that it was not until 18 January 1999 that he issued the subpoena in
terms of the effect of the expedition order
in May 1998 and the subsequent
fixing of the hearing date for trial at a time when a substantial number of
interlocutory proceedings
still had to be completed.  He did not turn his mind
to the issue of a comprehensive subpoena until those procedures had been
completed.
 Mr Angus was not cross-examined as to whether the defendant's case
on D1, D2, D6, D13-16 had been properly prepared in advance and
proper
investigations conducted and that the position was that the defendant was
simply not ready to proceed when the matter was
set down for hearing and the
matters the subject of the amendment were simply made to give extra time to
investigate the allegations
originally made before the trial.  Insofar as it
was otherwise suggested (<i>T894.35, T931-2)</i> Mr Angus's rejection was firm
and credible.
<P>

126   	I do not find Mr Angus to have "<i>delayed</i>" the issue
of the subpoena.  I do find that as a matter of fact a subpoena could have been
issued between 18 September 1998 and 18
January 1999 but the delay, in my view,
is not culpable;  I accept Mr Angus' explanation, it is feasible and makes
sense.  To embark
upon a consideration of what would have happened had a
subpoena been issued conformable with the defendant's knowledge that there
were
continuing investigations particularly in relation to D15 and D16, the attitude
of the Police, and particularly in the light
of the information the defendant
apparently had as to the existence of these people as complainants, would be
embarking on speculation,
in hindsight founded upon, amongst other things, the
fate that befell the plaintiff's subpoena issued before Christmas which was
met
with a successful claim for public interest immunity (Ireland J, 24 December
1998).
<P>

127   	The <i>seventh factor</i> relied upon by the plaintiff in
opposition to the defendant's application is that the plaintiff himself is
blameless.
<P>

128   	Blamelessness of the resisting party (here the
plaintiff), is a factor referred to by Kirby J in <b><i>J L Holdings </i></b>at
170.  In the defendant's case in chief on the amendment there was no suggestion
that the plaintiff was in any way to blame for
the late amendment.  I do not
propose to set out the submissions for the parties on this issue.  
<P>

129   	I have held Mr Angus to be without fault in terms of the
lateness of the issuing of the subpoena, though I have also held
that the
defendant knew about D1 to D6 and D15 and D16 by December 1998.  That, one
would think, would be the end of the matter.
 I hold that the plaintiff is
blameless.  This issue is of minimalist importance in my view.  There are far
more important issues
determinative of the defendant's application.
<P>

130   	The <i>eighth factor</i> is that the defendant has stated
in evidence that it was unaware of the fresh allegations not only at the time
of the broadcast but
also up until 11 February when it inspected the documents
produced by the Police.  It is stated for the plaintiff that the authorities
indicate that a relevant matter to be taken into account by the Court on an
amendment application to plead truth at the last minute
(which is not the case
here:  the defendant has always justified - this is an application to amend its
case on truth), is the defendant
being unaware of the fresh allegations at the
time of the initial publication.  
<P>

131   	There is cited on behalf of the plaintiff a statement
made by Stocker LJ in <b><i>Atkinson v Fitzwalter</i></b> at 221D "... <i>it
behoves a defendant to be in possession of all the relevant facts in support of
a contention before he makes the defamatory statement
and he cannot be allowed
to amend on the basis that his statement was unsupported by evidence known to
him at that time".</i>  It is suggested that that "<i>principle"</i> applies
the more so in the light of the imputations the jury have found, the defendant
having stated in terms in both broadcasts
that the imputations are true, the
defendant having repeated the imputations in a second program and having
admitted that it intended
to convey the imputations (presumably in
interrogatories).
<P>

132   	This is an extraordinary position for the plaintiff to
take:  it can be of no relevance to the issue of whether or not the
defendant
should be granted leave to amend its defence of justification.  The defence of
justification is not limited to the facts
known to the publisher at the time of
publication (<b><i>Maisel v Financial Times </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281915%29%20LT%20953" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1915) LT 953).</a>  The
substance of the imputations has always been the subject of a plea of
justification.  The defendant is seeking to amend its
case on that issue.  I
have accepted the defendant's position that the delay (of three months) in the
issuing of the subpoena was
without fault in the circumstances.  I indicate now
that I am persuaded that the defendant cannot be criticised for want of
promptitude
in seeking leave.  I am persuaded that the evidence fails to expose
a reasonable basis for asserting that the information was or
would have been
available to Channel 7 before 11 February 1999.  I reject this eighth basis
advanced for the plaintiff.
<P>

133   	The <i>ninth factor</i> is the defendant maintaining it
still has a viable defence of justification.  This is clear from Mr Angus'
evidence.  The present
application does not involve a situation where the
defendant will be wholly prevented from mounting a defence which might have led
to a successful result for it in the proceedings, so it is submitted.  It might
be one thing if the defendant had never mounted a
defence of justification
prior to the trial and had discovered at the last minute that the allegations
it had made were true.  Even
then the Court would be reluctant to grant the
amendment, so it is argued.  
<P>

134   	The plaintiff submits that in the present case the
defendant said in both broadcasts that the allegations were true and that
it
was in possession of sufficient facts to justify the imputations clearly
conveyed.  It is said that the defendant has D1, D2,
D3, D5, D6, D13, D15 and
D16 with which to run a complete defence of justification.  For that reason
alone the amendments should
not be granted.  The defendant is not being
prevented from running a defence.  It has had a defence of justification and
has had
one for years.  If, on the other hand, it has no faith in its defence
as previously pleaded it should not be permitted to "<i>throw mud" </i>at the
plaintiff.
<P>

135   	The defendant contends, as I have indicated, its
entitlement to run a "<i>full</i>" defence in accordance with authorities and
principles that ensure that the public interest is served in a fair hearing in
which
it is afforded the opportunity to present a case in full (cf.  <b><i>TCN
Channel Nine Pty Limited v Antoniadis</i></b> <i>(supra)</i> at 691D, 694C,
695C - E).  It is to be borne in mind however that relevant to the Court of
Appeal's consideration in <b><i>Antoniadis</i></b> was the fact that the
defendant did not rely on any new facts in support of the proposed defences and
there was no suggestion that
allowance of the amendment would have caused an
adjournment (this is why the Court of Appeal held that my discretion had
miscarried).
 It is said for the plaintiff that in the present case there is a
myriad of new facts which will be used to support the new "<i>defences</i>" and
these new facts and allegations will cause an adjournment in mid-trial for at
least six months.
<P>

136   	Leaving to one side the determination, in the event that
it arises, of the length of any adjournment, I am of the view that
the
defendant is perfectly entitled to take the position subject to all relevant
considerations founded in principle that it must
be able to present its full
case.  It is no answer to say "<i>well, you've got D1 to D16, what more do you
need?"</i>  The defendant is entitled, in my view, as a matter of principle to
seek to present its full case.  If the defendant is otherwise
entitled to
amend, it would be an extraordinary state of affairs for it to be confined to
all that was perceived to be "<i>needed" </i>rather than to be in a position to
advance all in support of a defence, (cf .  Lord Denning MR in <b><i>Associated
Leisure</i></b>), thereby being deprived of the opportunity to litigate matters
that might have ensured that there was a complete answer to the plaintiff's
claim.  I see no merit in this component of the plaintiff's opposition.
<P>

137   	The <i>tenth factor</i> raised is the risk of the
plaintiff's witnesses dying.  There is simply no evidence in advance of the
position that was placed before
the Court on the expedition proceedings.
<P>

138   	The <i>eleventh factor</i> is case management principles
in the Defamation List.
<P>

139   	It is stated that as noted by Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh
JJ in <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b><i> </i>at 155, <i>"case management, involving
as it does the efficiency of the procedures of the Court was in this case a
relevant consideration"</i>.  In <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> a relevant issue
focussed upon by the trial judge was the loss of the hearing date and the High
Court held that in the circumstances
there was no real likelihood of this.  The
plaintiff submits that in the present case the loss of the hearing date is a
relevant
consideration.
<P>

140   	If the defendant's application succeeds and terms are
imposed, the hearing date has not been lost but the continuation of
the hearing
rather will be adjourned.  As I have remarked earlier, the continuation of the
hearing of this case will be the continuation
of the hearing of Mr Marsden's
matter with the benefit of its status as an expedited one and that factor will
be taken into account
in the event of the allowance of the amendment and
management being required.
<P>

141   	The submissions otherwise advanced for the plaintiff
under this heading are rhetorical.  They really amount to an assertion
that a
case having gone through the Directions procedure of the Defamation List and
being allocated a hearing date will enjoy a status
whereby a defendant simply
should not be permitted to amend or in some way will undergo closer scrutiny
than the application of the
usual principles commands.  I do not agree.  It is
unwise, in my respectful view, to make sweeping statements about the conduct of
media defendants in invidious comparison to any other litigants in the List in
relation to their litigious behaviour vis-a-vis plaintiffs.
 Equally it is
unwise to make broad statements of policy that will apply inflexibly merely
because the matter is a defamation matter
and has gone through the List.
<P>

142   	Case management, in my view, should not prevail over the
justice of the particular application.  Insofar as the plaintiff
was trenchant
in his criticism of the defendant as an exemplar of media organisations one
could, with facility, be critical of the
plaintiff for embarking upon the
amendment of its imputations.  If, as is submitted, late amendments by
defendants to justify are
the "<i>bane</i>" of the Defamation List, that charge
also can be levelled at the tiresome frequency with which plaintiffs amend
their imputations
at or shortly before trial.  An amendment of the imputations,
viewed objectively is really a fundamentally more serious step:  the
plaintiff
is seeking to change the very causes of action on which that plaintiff is
suing.  Any change made as a result of a legitimate
application to amend has
immense flow-on effects not the least reason for which is that the imputation
is the starting point.  I
do not consider it appropriate to descend into the
arena on this issue as I do not consider it appropriate to make "<i>policy</i>"
statements in the conduct of the Defamation List as opposed to procedural
directions.
<P>

143   	The amendments to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> in 1994
permit a degree of flexibility.  A jury comes and performs its function and it
goes:  all other issues are left to the trial
judge.  The Court is therefore
not faced with the practical problem of having present a jury whilst
contentious matters of law are
dealt with.  The mere availability of such
flexibility however, should not be understood as permitting <i>"open
slather"</i> by either plaintiffs or defendants in terms of seeking amendments.
The feature of the flexibility is in the management of cases generally
but in
particular in those trials where amendment applications are legitimately made
and granted.
<P>

144   	In the instant litigation it has been made clear to the
parties that it is the desire of the Court, that is of the Common
Law Division,
that the trial of this action be completed as soon as possible.  In the
<i>"early days</i>" that desire was expressed in terms that it is the hope of
the Court that the trial of this action will finish in 1999.  At the end
of six
months the only component of the <i>"trial</i>" has been the finding by the
jury that the publications conveyed defamatory imputations (after a hearing
that is measured in mere
days).
<P>

145   	In the context of "<i>case management</i>" and in the
event of the amendment being allowed, that factor together with the fact that
the case is an expedited one will be accommodated
in directions as to the
further management of the "<i>hearing</i>" of the trial.
<P>

146   	The observations I have made above about the
non-desirability about making statements of "<i>policy"</i>, I have made in
full knowledge of the announcement by Hunt J (as he then was) on 14 October
1988 which was cited by Badgery-Parker
J in <b><i>Jones v TCN Channel
Nine</i></b> at 9.  His Honour's announcement cannot constitute binding
authority and I do not consider that it purports to do so.  His Honour
was
stating general principles of particular concern in the operation of the
Defamation List.
<P>

147   	The plaintiff contends that if the Court allows the
defendant to amend its defence in this case there will be almost no situation
in which an amendment of this kind will be refused.  I do not accept this
proposition:  it smacks of a "<i>floodgates</i>" argument.  If the defendant
succeeds in this application it will be on the basis that it has made out a
case for amendment on the
evidence in accordance with the principles that
apply.  If it fails it will be for reasons to similar effect.  The principles
will
apply to any application for amendment, the outcome will depend upon the
factual material and the application of those principles
to the found facts.
<P>

148   	The <i>twelfth factor</i> is said to be the prejudice to
the plaintiff which cannot be compensated by costs.  It is, of course, in the
discretion of the judge
to make an order for costs appropriate to the
circumstances of the amendment. These may include an order for costs in
relation to
the application for leave to amend itself;  the costs arising from
or occasioned by the amendment or costs thrown away by the amendment,
including
any adjournment.  It will be open to the judge to make an order that the costs
be subject to assessment forthwith.
<P>

149   	Insofar as it is alleged that a costs order will not
compensate the plaintiff for any personal stress he endures as a result
of the
amendment and any adjournment, it is to be borne in mind that the stress and
anxiety the plaintiff undergoes in the course
of the litigation as a whole is a
factor that can be taken into account in the assessment of general damages. 
<P>

150   	I am not persuaded that the plaintiff's submissions
elevate this component to the level indicated.  It is a matter that is
taken
into account generally in an application of this kind and is one amenable to
appropriate orders of the Court upon its disposition.
<P>

151   	The <i>thirteenth factor</i> is the defendant's intention
to overreach.  
<P>

152   	In <b><i>J L Holdings,</i></b> at 153, Dawson, Gaudron
&amp; McHugh JJ quoted with approval the statement, cited above, by Bowen LJ in
<b><i>Cropper v Smith</i></b> where his Lordship said that the Court would not
allow an amendment if it formed the view that the amendment was "<i>intended to
overreach</i>" the other party.  The plaintiff submits the present amendment
application is made with such an intention.  The plaintiff's submits
that if
the Court forms the view that the defendant is deliberately attempting to
strain the plaintiff's emotional and financial
resources for tactical reasons
the Court will disallow the amendments.
<P>

153   	It is not in dispute that the defendant has been in
possession of most of the plaintiff's psychiatric evidence and it is
asserted
that the defendant has been aware of what the plaintiff asserts to be his dire
psychiatric state.  Any tactics adopted by
the defendant must be viewed in the
light of its knowledge of the plaintiff's vulnerability in this regard.  
<P>

154   	The plaintiff further contends that the defendant also
knows that the longer the case goes on, and the greater the time spent
in
preparation, the less likely it is the plaintiff will be left with any money in
his hand at the end of the case even if he wins.
 This will arise because there
is a clear differential, it is said, between the costs incurred by a plaintiff
and those which are
obtained upon assessment.
<P>

155   	The purpose in bringing defamation proceedings is to
attain a <i>solatium</i> for hurt to feelings and compensation for the fact
that the plaintiff's reputation has been damaged.  It is important that such
proceedings
be resolved quickly; the risk being that if they are drawn out the
purpose of bringing them is defeated.  The plaintiff submits that
if one starts
from the premise that if the Court formed the view that the reason for the
large number of complaints was to pressurise
the plaintiff it would decline the
amendments.  That premise is critical.
<P>

156   	The plaintiff submits that various matters show that the
defendant's intention in pursuing the amendments is to overreach
rather than to
raise allegations which the defendant believes are likely to succeed.
<P>

157   	It is contended that there has been no full investigation
by the defendant of the allegations relating to D17 to D25.  It
is further put
that the defendant has not attempted to "<i>sift</i>" or to select a number of
the allegations from D1 to D6, D13 to D16 and D17 to D25 on the basis that it
cannot be that all of these
complaints are of equal merit.  There is no reason
why the defendant should not be put in a position where it has to elect which
allegations to press and which to forego.  If the defendant does maintain that
all the allegations are likely to succeed, it is no
doubt content, so it is
asserted, for a special costs order to be made in relation to the costs
occasioned by any particular of truth
which is rejected (and on the basis that
this order will be made come-what-may).  This is disputed by the defendant.
<P>

158   	It is said that the evidence shows that Mr Angus
deliberately held off notifying the plaintiff in relation to the new amendments
respecting D13 to D16.  He no doubt knew, it is submitted, that the plaintiff
would want time to investigate these matters and yet
deliberately put him in
the position where he either had to seek an adjournment of the proceedings or
else proceed with the case
without proper investigation of the particulars
relating to D13-D16.  (See Exhibit 11 tabs 18 and 25; affidavit of Mr Angus
dated
4 February 1999).  
<P>

159   	The defendant submits that that submission is not open
and indeed, is not supported by the evidence and that such evidence
as there is
to the contrary (<i>T541.15-30</i>).  The proposition itself was not put to Mr
Angus in cross-examination.  In any event the evidence is that the plaintiff
has extensively
investigated the allegations made by D15 and D16.  In the
context of overreaching, the defendant's submissions in relation to D13
to D16
to the effect that the evidence clearly establishes that the plaintiff knew of
the allegations long before the defendant did
and was well able to meet them
and had marshalled information to attack them for the purposes of putting
material before Mr Woodhouse,
must be taken into account.
<P>

160   	The plaintiff asserts the defendant is aware that the
allegations involve matters of antiquity, that the investigation and
preparation of such a case involves extra preparation and cost, and that the
increase in the length of the case by reason of the
fresh allegations will
greatly distort the difference between the costs which are payable on
assessment and those which are actually
incurred.  This is disputed by the
defendant: no evidence being offered in support by the plaintiff.
<P>

161   	Further, it is submitted, that the defendant is well
aware of the weakness of many of its allegations made in its particulars
of
truth.
<P>

162   	The plaintiff suggests that the Court will form the view
that there has been absolutely no attempt by the defendant to abbreviate
this
amendment application and again, the differential between the costs which are
payable on assessment and those which are payable
between solicitor and client
are here relevant.  
<P>

163   	Many of the allegations made in the particulars are
"<i>scurrilous</i>" and I will deal the submissions in that regard in due
course.
<P>

164   	Further, reliance is placed upon what is asserted to be
the "<i>holding off"</i> of issuing a subpoena to the Police until just before
the trial (as to which see my findings above). 
<P>

165   	The defendant has made late amendments to the particulars
in relation to D1, D2 and D6 and in particular, the amendments
show that there
has never been any proper preparation of this component of the case.
<P>

166   	In the light of these matters, if accepted, the Court may
infer that the defendant is using the amendment application as
part of the
general tactic to try to overreach the plaintiff.  If the Court concludes that
this is the case, the amendment application
should be declined.
<P>

167   	The defendant maintains its position as to what is meant
by intended to overreach in that it is submitted that for the purposes
of an
application to amend the relevant consideration is whether or not the evidence
establishes the application is made <i>mala fides</i> (cf.  <b><i>Douglas v
John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%203%20NSWLR%20126" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 3 NSWLR 126</a> at 135C and
<b><i>Jones</i></b> <i>(supra) </i>at 5).  It is the general submission of the
defendant that there is no evidence that the defendant or its representatives
have acted
otherwise than <i>bona fides</i> in relation to this application.

<P>

168   	Further, although it was put to Mr Angus in
cross-examination that he delayed in issuing the subpoena to disrupt and delay
the proceedings (<i>T857.1, T534.35</i>), he denied that he knew at the time
when he issued the subpoena it had the potential to interrupt the proceedings
by causing extensive
delay.  It was not put to Mr Angus that he had not given
truthful answers in cross-examination and thus his denial should be
accepted.
<P>

169   	With respect to the submission made by the plaintiff that
the present amendments are made with the intention to overreach
the plaintiff
the defendant responds that it is not open to the plaintiff to so submit.  It
was not put to Mr Angus that the defendant's
purpose in applying to add
particulars to its defence was <i>mala fides</i>.  It was not suggested to Mr
Angus that he was not of the honest belief that the application to amend was
for the legitimate purpose
of the defendant resisting the plaintiff's claim for
damages.
<P>

170   	The defendant, of course, does not accept that the claim
made that the plaintiff is suffering a "<i>major depressive episode</i>" of
such magnitude that he is disabled from prosecuting the litigation.
<P>

171   	The submission that the defendant knows that the longer
the case goes on for the less likely it is the plaintiff will be
left with any
money is met with the proposition that such a submission is not open to the
plaintiff.  It was not put directly to
Mr Angus that his manner of conducting
this litigation on behalf of the defendant was to deliberately financially
exhaust the plaintiff
or that he had adopted an illegitimate tactic for the
purpose of causing the plaintiff to incur unnecessary expenditure.  The
defendant
submits there is no evidence upon which the Court could make a
finding that if the plaintiff was successful and obtained a costs
order in his
favour he will not adequately be compensated for costs.
<P>

172   	The importance of having a rapid resolution of the
litigation should not prevail over the need to ensure that resolution
is of all
matters in issue at the trial on the merits, so submits the defendant.  There
is no evidence upon which the Court could
come to a finding that the reason why
the defendant particularised several complainants was to "<i>pressurise</i>"
the plaintiff.  The evidence is to the contrary (<i>T542-543)</i>.  The
defendant carefully chose which complainants to particularise (<i>T931</i>).
Further, it appears Mr Woodhouse's report to the DPP does contain a complainant
not in fact particularised by the defendant.
<P>

173   	As to the suggestion by the plaintiff that various
matters point to the defendant's intention to overreach him, Mr Angus
denied
that he did not have sufficient material to plead and maintain a plea of
justification, asserted that the he did exercise
caution (<i>T541.34-542.40;
T892.39-893.57; T894.35-894.38; T895.32-895.36; T896.54-897.20;
T897.30-897.32)</i>.
<P>

174   	I have considered the evidence generally and
specifically. Mr Angus was thoroughly cross-examined, was firm and candid in
his responses and I accept his testimony.  These matters of intended
withholding, delay and intentional conduct I find not to have
been made out.
<P>

175   	At the time an application to amend is made there is no
way of evaluating the evidence which may subsequently be called to
support the
case of which particulars are given.  The quality of the evidence is always for
determination at the trial:  <b><i>Tedeschi</i> </b><i>(supra)</i> at 12.  In a
defamation case the plaintiff may ask that a defendant's conduct be taken into
account only if it demonstrates a lack
of good faith or is improper or
unjustifiable.  However, "<i>the vigorous persistence in a legitimate defence
cannot be used to aggravated the damages.  The manifest unfairness of any
contrary
view is obvious"</i>:  <b><i>Steele v Mirror Newspapers Limited
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%202%20NSWLR%20348" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 2 NSWLR 348</a> at 379D per Samuels JA. 
<P>

176   	As to the allegations as to deliberating withholding the
issue of the subpoena this has been dealt with above and I have
made my
findings.
<P>

177   	With respect to the late amendments made to D1, D2 and D6
Mr Angus gave an explanation therefor at <i>T932</i> on which he was not
cross-examined.  I accept his testimony.
<P>

178   	In response the plaintiff identifies his central
submission as that the defendant in the amendment application is
"<i>attempting" </i>to overreach him.  I presume the plaintiff is being
consistent here.  The plaintiff hitherto has asserted the defendant is
"<i>intending</i>" to overreach.  I take this expression in the written
submissions to mean no more than the defendant is intending to overreach or
intending to attempt to overreach.  The key point, the plaintiff says, is that
the Court is not dealing with the situation where
a dozen potential
complainants were provided by the Police and where the defendant has carefully
looked at each one and decided to
plead (say) three complainants which it
asserts are credible.  Instead, the defendant has simply thrown every
allegation that it
can at the plaintiff.  Many of the allegations are obviously
flawed, it is said;  however, the defendant submits that it is entitled
to
force the plaintiff to "<i>spend many tens of thousands of dollars
investigating these complaints, adjourn the hearing of this case and face up to
a trial which
will probably be three times longer by reason of these additional
allegations</i>".  I find this somewhat rhetorical and question-begging:  the
defendant has the right to seek leave to amend to present a case or
in the
instant application, an additional or expanded case in support of the plea of
justification which has always been on the record.
 The defendant can take the
view and take the view at its peril, that each and every one of the proposed
new allegations is viable
and credible.
<P>

179   	In any event the plaintiff persists in asserting that the
matters just referred to come on top of a variety of other circumstances
which
add to the "<i>pressure</i>" put on Mr Marsden.  These matters include his
fragile psychiatric condition (which will be dealt with later); the difference
between
actual costs and costs on assessment which differential increases the
longer the period of preparation and hearing (there is no evidence
in this
regard and in any event, an order for costs can, in my view, ultimately
accommodate this problem if it exists).
<P>

180   	A further matter on top of everything else is asserted to
be that the very "<i>amendment application itself has been stated to be
approximately four weeks longer than most defamation trials". </i> It is
certainly the longest interlocutory amendment application in my experience.  It
has certainly, in its duration, exceeded defamation
trials over which I have
presided.  The length of the application can be viewed as no more than a fact
of life during the course
of this hostile and vigorously contested litigation;
the defendant proposed to amend, sought leave to amend, the application has
been vigorously contested and as it so happens took about eight weeks.  There,
that aspect can rest.
<P>

181   	The plaintiff submitted that the defendant should be
invited to nominate which of the allegations from D13 to D15 it believes
are
most likely to succeed (a suggested invitation, it is to be noted, made in the
context where no opposition is advanced to the
amendments incorporating D13 to
D16).  If the defendant, it is said, is not in a position to say which ones are
most likely to succeed,
that is an additional ground for refusing the amendment
application.  If on the other hand, the defendant is able to indicate which
allegations have a strong likelihood of success, it should be invited to rely
upon those allegations and those alone in the particulars
which it seeks leave
to add.  It is the defendant's refusal to <i>"prune</i>" its case which is most
indicative of the defendant's intention to overreach.  What reason, it is
asked, can the defendant have for
pressing all of these allegations in this
situation other than the stringing out of the plaintiff?
<P>

182   	The short answer, as I have already indicated, is the
defendant's belief that it is entitled to present its full case, it
is aware of
the perils of presenting a weak case but it should not be shut out, all other
things being equal, from presenting that
case in its possession to meet the
plaintiff's claim for damages.  If the leave amendment application is
successful, the quality
of the evidence will be determined at the trial, the
outcome of which determination might have a profound effect on the ultimate
outcome of the litigation.  I reject therefore the plaintiff's submission as to
the defendant failing to "<i>prune</i>" its proposed case.
<P>

183   	The plaintiff urges upon the Court the need to be astute
to prevent large media companies from engaging in tactics which
render the
whole purpose of proceedings futile.  I agree.  When I say "<i>I agree</i>" I
say no more than that the Court should be astute to ensure that no defendant
(or indeed, plaintiff) engage in tactics which render
the whole purpose of
proceedings futile.  As I have made clear above, I am not prepared to make
sweeping statements in the course
of a judgment as to the conduct of media
corporations in defamation actions.
<P>

184   	In relation to the question of costs the plaintiff relies
upon the failure of the defendant to suggest that it is prepared
to submit to
such a costs order.  The defendant, in my view, is entitled to abide the
outcome of the application.
<P>

185   	It is further submitted by the plaintiff that the
defendant's submissions that Mr Angus did not deliberately hold off anything
in
notification of the plaintiff with respect to D13-D16 is without foundation.
It is positively asserted by the plaintiff that Mr
Angus did hold off.  The
evidence, it is said, discloses that the defendant through Mr Quail was
investigating allegations concerning
D13 and D15 prior to 2 October (Mr
Woodhouse affidavit 2 March 1999 annexure E).  The same evidence discloses that
on that day the
defendant through Mr Quail learnt that both D15 and D16 were
"<i>police witnesses</i>" against the plaintiff.  The defendant made contact
with D13 and D15 no later than 10 and 11 November 1998 (Mr Angus' affidavit 4
February 1999 paragraphs 3 and 13), and took their signed statements on 9 and
11 December 1998 (Mr Angus <i>(supra)</i> paragraphs 7 and 14).  The
particulars concerning D15 were notified to the plaintiff on 6 January.  When
the plaintiff finally got
a copy of the 11 December statement provided by D15
on which the 6 January particulars were based (Exhibit 11, tab 18), it became
clear that Mr Angus's statement that the particulars based on the statement
were provided as soon as possible was false:  the proposition
advanced by the
plaintiff is simply that the particulars could have been drafted by anyone in
five minutes.  There is some ingenuousness,
I respectfully suggest, in this
proposition advanced for the plaintiff.  When one views the chronology
realistically, the submissions
is without merit.
<P>

186   	The remaining factors out of the original seventeen are
<i>fourteen</i> - subpoena to the Police was an abuse of process;
<i>fifteen</i> - documents obtained as a result of an agreement to abuse the
process of the Court;  and <i>sixteen</i> - breach by the Police of their duty
to notify the plaintiff of the subpoena and the proposed agreement.  It is
appropriate that
these matters be dealt with on the question of the subpoena.

<P>

187   	There is the additional ground namely, <i>seventeen</i>
which has already been referred to, namely the antiquity of the allegations and
the difficulty of investigations.
<P>

188   	It is said the fresh allegations involve matters going
back to the 1970s.  This is apparently the case on an overview of
all the
particulars.  In that situation the plaintiff submits the words of May LJ in
<b><i>Atkinson v Fitzwalter</i></b> at 210 are apposite:  "<i>it must be
remembered that fraud is a very serious allegation to make against a person, as
for instance, would be an allegation of
criminal offence and may, if not raised
at the outset, be difficult, if not impossible, properly to investigate at a
later stage
in the proceedings"</i>.  
<P>

189   	In relation to this seventeenth factor the plaintiff says
that he has had enough difficulties in trying to investigate the
allegations
made against him in the four years since the proceedings were first commenced.
It is simply not fair to him to postpone
the hearing indefinitely so that
Channel 7 can see if they can put together a case that they have already had
four years to investigate
and which involve allegations which stretch back ten
to twenty five years.
<P>

190   	This reverts to the "<i>premise</i>".  As by now should
be clear I do not find the defendant intentionally to be overreaching the
plaintiff (even taking into account
some of the scurrilous particulars to which
I refer below).  The fundamental reality as I find it on the evidence is that
the information
came to the defendant late;  it was not otherwise available
earlier.  Such information, for example, relating to D15-D16, was not
deliberately withheld from the plaintiff who, in any event, could not have been
surprised thereby.  It is not a case of the defendant
"<i>seeing if it can put
together a case"</i>.  It is, as I see it, in context, a <i>bona fide</i>
application for leave to expand an existing case of justification which it is
free to make.  
<P>

191   	The amendments concerning D17 are not consented to.
Although the plaintiff still has much to do, it is said, to prepare to
meet a
case involving D17, it is not asserted that this prejudice is the reason why
this amendment should be disallowed.  Thus, of
the seventeen factors relied
upon in relation to the other amendments, all factors are relied upon except
the need for a lengthy
adjournment.  There is one caveat:  if amendments are
made other than in relation to D1, D2, D6, D13-D16 then a lengthy adjournment
will be required.  In substance therefore, D17 is in the same category as
D18-D25.  
<P>

192   	The allegations in relation to D1, D2 and D6 are the
subject of the plaintiff's Motions filed on 7 May 1999 to disallow certain
amendments purportedly made by leave but which were not in fact
<i>"consequential</i>".  Further amendments were proposed in relation to D6 in
the First Consolidated Particulars of Truth of 18 February and then by letter
dated 17 March.  These allegations have all been changed which changes are
"<i>presumptively prejudicial</i>" and time consuming.  For example, in
relation to D1, the allegation is now dated at mid-1976 were as it was formerly
dated January
1975.  As to D2, by way of further example, this was formerly
1979 which was then changed to 1975 and then May 1975 (with a change
of birth
date from 1965 to 1961).  As to D6, the allegation originally related to an
unidentified place at some time between 1982
and 1988;  then Easter in 1984 at
Noosa;  then Easter in 1983 at Noosa;  it is now 1982 at some unspecified
place.  
<P>

193   	It is contended that these variations represent an
irresponsible approach on the part of the defendant and are indicative
of a
failure properly to check dates or otherwise to make proper inquiry.  The
evidence is (<i>T932</i>) that the defendant's solicitors had no contact with
D6 until February 1999.  It is submitted that if a basic check had been made
as
to D6's age it would have been realised that the allegations in the original
particulars even if proved to be true could not prove
the truth of the
imputations because D6 was 18 at the relevant time.  Thus, it is argued that
the amendment should be disallowed
or alternatively, taken as evidence that the
defendant is trying to overreach the plaintiff.  I reject both submissions.
The plaintiff
has consented to these amendments.  The "<i>changes</i>" no doubt
will be matters which will confront the defendant at trial.
<P>

194   	The defendant's response is that as to D1, D2 and D6 Mr
Angus was not cross-examined upon the evidence he gave at <i>T932</i>.  As to
D13 and D16 in circumstances where the plaintiff had had ample opportunity to
investigate these allegations, no condition
should be attached to the amendment
as sought by the plaintiff.  In this regard see the letter of 14 October being
annexure B to
Mr Lee's affidavit of 28 April 1999 and the letter of 20
September 1998 being annexure C to Mr Woodhouse's affidavit of 2 March 1999.
 I
accept the defendant's contentions in this regard.
<P>

195   	The plaintiff also contends that the amendment should be
disallowed by reason of <i>scurrilous allegations</i> in the particulars and
they themselves represent an intention on the part of the defendant to
overreach the plaintiff.
<P>

196   	It is to be borne in mind that the plaintiff's
imputations set out at the beginning of this judgment are concerned with sexual
intercourse and the defendant's contextual imputations are concerned, as to the
first program, both "<i>homosexual intercourse"</i> and "<i>sexual
intercourse</i>" and, in relation to the second program, with <i>"homosexual
intercourse</i>".
<P>

197   	The Second Consolidated Particulars open with a preamble
which purports to define "<i>homosexual intercourse</i>" to include anal
penetration, fellatio, the continuation of either of those forms of
intercourse, mutual masturbation and the striking
of a male person by another
male person during sexual intercourse or as part of foreplay to sexual
intercourse.  The plaintiff is
prepared to accept that the ordinary meaning of
intercourse in the context of any of the imputations can only be anal
intercourse
or fellatio or the continuation of either.  Recourse to the Oxford
Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary to elicit some definition
that speaks
merely of "<i>sexual gratification</i>" does not satisfy me.  I have no
difficulty at all in coming to the conclusion that where <i>"homosexual
intercourse</i>" or <i>"sexual intercourse</i>" is referred to in the
imputations, according to its ordinary meaning, it has only one of the first
three "<i>connotations"</i>.  "<i>Mutual masturbation"</i> and
<i>"striking"</i> cannot be <i>"intercourse</i>" but evidence thereof may be
admissible in respect of activity constituting the first three
"<i>connotations</i>".
<P>

198   	Indeed, I will go so far as to say they are the only
meanings the imputations can have as arising from the programs telecast
by the
defendant.  They are the only meanings the imputations do have.  There is
absolutely no room for manoeuvre as far as questioning
the meaning of the
imputations.
<P>

199   	As was stated in <b><i>TCN Channel Nine v
Antoniadis</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 682</a> at 7202F "<i>the proper function of
particulars is to limit the issues under the pleadings and inform the opposite
party of the case he has to
meet.  In general a party providing particulars
need not disclose the evidence on which he relies but particulars may have this

Isaacs J in <b><i>The Queen v Associated Northern Collieries</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2011%20CLR%20738" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 11
CLR 738</a> at 740-741.  This statement of principle also conforms with the
statement in <b><i>Dare v Pulham</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 70</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20148%20CLR%20658" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 148 CLR 658</a> at 664.  
<P>

200   	Mr Stitt Q.C. who argued this aspect of the application
for the defendant placed reliance upon what Hunt J said in <b><i>Sims v
Wran</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20NSWLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 NSWLR 317</a> at 321G:  "<i>there is often a fine line
between giving particulars of the case which a party proposes to make and
disclosing the evidence by which
that case is proposed to be proved.  It all
depends on what is necessary to guard the other party against surprise.  If the
other
party cannot be otherwise so guarded, it may sometimes be necessary for a
party to disclose his evidence, or at least a broad outline
of it.  The
starting point is what is necessary to guard the other party against surprise;
the starting point is not what can be
said without disclosing the evidence to
be lead.  It is however important to emphasise that, ordinarily speaking,
particulars are
concerned with the nature of the case to be made by way of
evidence; ..."</i>
<P>

201   	That is, the case to be made by way of evidence on the
particular issue.  There must be some logical connection between a
fact, matter
or circumstance particularised and, if it is proved, the issue to which the
proof of such fact, matter or circumstance
goes to establish.  To shortly state
an example:  if it is particularised that on day X the plaintiff had anal
intercourse with person
Y at place Z and those facts are proved, their proof
will logically be connected with the substantial truth of one of the
imputations.
 At the other extreme, as exemplified by Mr Reynolds in argument,
a particular that whilst in London in 1975 the plaintiff shot a
brown dog would
obviously have no rational connection at all with that ultimate issue to be
proved.
<P>

202   	I have already remarked upon the obvious meaning of
sexual intercourse involved in the considerations of the imputations
and
contextual imputations.  One component of many of the particulars attacked by
the plaintiff is the reference to "<i>sexual activity</i>".  To state that
"<i>sexual activity</i>" took place between the plaintiff and X is a totally
insufficient particularisation of a case in support of the substantial truth
of
the relevant imputations. 
<P>

203   	A further component of this segment of the argument on
the amendment application is what clearly appears to be an attempt
by the
defendant to rely upon "<i>tendency</i>" evidence.
<P>

204   	Mr Stitt argued that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>
(NSW) </i>has no application in the instant litigation because character,
reputation, conduct or tendency are facts in issue.  There is thus
no
requirement that the notices referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 97(1)</a> will be required.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 6(2)</a> requires that the notice must state the substance of the
evidence of the kind referred to in the subsection and if that evidence
consists of or includes evidence of the conduct of a person particulars of the
date, time, place and circumstances at or in which
the conduct occurred and the
names and addresses of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the
conduct so far as they
are known to the notifying party.  Even if Mr Stitt is
correct in asserting the non-application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act
1995</a> (NSW)</i> to the circumstances of this case, (which I presently do not
decide) the requirements of the notice just referred to pretty well
indicate
the kind of particulars that the defendant is obliged to give.
<P>

205   	The first component of the Second Consolidated
Particulars attacked by the plaintiff was item 20.  Mr Stitt Q.C. for the
defendant conceded that standing by itself this set of "<i>particulars</i>"
would not "<i>stand a snowball's hope in hell"</i>.  It has the same level of
hope, in my view, even included with the other particulars and cannot be saved
by seeking to convert it
into some form of "<i>summary</i>" or
"<i>conclusion</i>" based upon that which precedes it.  I do not propose to
repeat the terms of paragraph 20.  I merely note that it covers but twenty
four
years, does not discriminate between ages of boys let alone when.  I accept the
plaintiff's submission as to item 20 as a set
of scurrilous particulars.  Item
20 will be "<i>struck out</i>". 
<P>

206   	Paragraph 19 of the particulars purports to particularise
the defendant's case in relation to D25.  Nowhere in those particulars
is there
any allegation of sexual conduct as between the plaintiff and D25.  Indeed,
from internal material, D25 did not meet the
plaintiff until 1992 when he was
26 years of age.  After that there are the most generalised allegations not
about the plaintiff,
but about a place called the City Plaza Hotel and what
went on there.  In what conceivable way can the plaintiff view the contents
of
paragraph 19 as either directly or indirectly "<i>limiting the issues</i>" or
informing him of the "<i>case"</i> he has to meet, that is, of a case that
bears a rational relationship with the proof of the substantial truth of the
imputation?
 I would rank the particulars under paragraph 19 in the same
category as those under 20.  They will be "<i>struck out</i>".  The defendant
will not be granted leave in respect of D25.
<P>

207   	The next paragraph the subject of criticism is paragraph
16 relating to one Trevor Michael Pollard.  The same observations
relate to
paragraph 16;  they will be "<i>struck out</i>".
<P>

208   	As to paragraph 15, it makes no allegation directly or
indirectly against the plaintiff in respect of the plaintiff's conduct
with a
young boy in a sexual sense.  Indeed, in sub-paragraph 5 of paragraph 15
wherein Mr Brinkworth purports to remember merely
the plaintiff arriving at the
hotel with a "<i>young scruffy looking teenager</i>", it does not coincide with
any other particular especially that set out in paragraph 10 where an event is
described as having taken
place at The Regent Hotel. 
<P>

209   	Paragraph 15 without more is a, generalised recitation
that fails to specify any particular matter rationally capable of
going to the
substantial truth of the relevant imputation.  It will be <i>"struck out</i>".

<P>

210   	For similar reasons I would not allow that which is
purported to be particularised in paragraph 9(4), (12) and (14).
<P>

211   	Paragraph 8 of the particulars deals with D16 and at
great length.  I will not allow paragraph 8(26).  What the defendant
has failed
to do is to specify with precision what acts took place.  For example, in
sub-paragraph (18) what I understand to be arrangements
for meetings that are
alleged to have culminated in homosexual intercourse went on until 1994 or 1995
when D16 was aged 23 or 24.
 Whilst I do not propose to "<i>strike out</i>"
these paragraphs the defendant will be confronted with the situation where the
greatest of care will have to be taken by it in leading
evidence from this
complainant and in leading the "<i>relevant" </i>evidence, and by relevant I
mean relevant to the proof of the substantial truth of the imputations.  In
relation to D16 I consider
sub-paragraph 8(23) to be an irrelevant
assertion.
<P>

212   	With respect to paragraph 7 dealing with D15, clearly
sub-paragraph (20) must go.  It is an irrelevant assertion.  One possible
explanation for it remaining in the Second Consolidated Particulars is some
indirect relevance to what have become known as the "<i>Anita Cobby
imputations</i>".  It is argued by Mr Stitt that this goes to the
"<i>gravity</i>" of the conduct.  It does not.  The gravity is contained in the
imputation which if proved to be true will make clear to the world
how serious
the conduct of the plaintiff was.  What is asserted in paragraph (20) cannot on
any rational basis go to prove the truth
of any imputation.
<P>

213   	No argument was addressed to sub-paragraph (19) the
relevance of which escapes me, however I will make no order in regard
to it.
<P>

214   	Otherwise, complaint is made about the use such
expressions as "<i>sexual contact</i>" or <i>"encounter</i>".  I see no
necessity to conduct a strip and burn operation in relation to the particulars
concerning D15 to cure these defects.
 The defendant again will have to
exercise caution in the presentation of its case in chief in relation to this
complainant.
<P>

215   	Whilst the plaintiff has to some extent succeeded on the
cause of scurrilous particulars, I do not find that outcome to evidence
intentional overreaching.  The plaintiff can seek his remedy for the
defendant's conduct in this regard in the area of aggravated
damages - if a
case therefor is made out at the relevant time.
<P>

216   	The point thus has been reached where what is said to be
the penultimate bar to amendment is to be considered.
<P>

217   	I turn now the psychiatric component.  On 23 March 1999
it was asserted on behalf of the plaintiff that he would suffer an
extreme
psychiatric reaction from an adjournment occasioned by any amendment.  This was
put in response to a question from myself
to the effect that if the defendant
was otherwise entitled to a grant of leave, should it be refused because of the
plaintiff's "<i>extreme psychiatric state</i>" because of which the consequence
of the grant leave in terms of adjournment and delay will cause him grievous
injury?
<P>

218   	On 1 March 1999 the plaintiff consulted Dr Dent whose
diagnosis was that he was suffering from such a degree of depression
as to
amount to a very serious illness.
<P>

219   	Dr White was qualified by the defendant to interview the
plaintiff on 23 March 1999, in order to determine whether the plaintiff
had
developed a psychiatric disorder which would put his life in danger if the
Court hearing was prolonged or whether he was suffering
understandable distress
from the lengthy and highly personalised proceedings.  
<P>

220   	Shortly stated, it is submitted for the defendant that Dr
Dent's evidence was that his view is that it is in the plaintiff's
best
interests to continue with the litigation to its end for as long as it takes
under his supervision with appropriate medication
because he is able to cope
(<i>T684</i>).  There is no requirement for hospital treatment nor for referral
to a mood disorder specialist;  the likelihood is that he will
recover
(<i>T685</i>) and it is Dr Dent's hope and goal to manage the plaintiff through
the litigation and it is his expectation that this will be achieved.
 He will
do his best to support and help the plaintiff to cope through any period of
interruption or postponement of the trial (<i>T695</i>).  
<P>

221   	Except for an occasion of 20 January 1999 (as to which
there is no report nor indeed, any need for medication), the plaintiff
had not
consulted Dr Dent between 4 September 1998 and 1 March 1999 (T693).  Dr Dent's
report of 8 September 1998 (annexure A to
Mr Potter's affidavit of 14 September
1998) reports on the consultation which took place on 4 September 1998.  His
view was that
Mr Marsden was then suffering from a mood change rather than an
illness as a result of an event at Mascot airport.  Medication was
prescribed
in the form of Nortab and the plaintiff was then able to cope.  
<P>

222   	Dr Dent had first seen the plaintiff on 21 April 1998
(report dated 18 May 1999); his then view was that the plaintiff had
recovered
from an episode of severe depression and no medication was prescribed
<i>(T688-9</i>). 
<P>

223   	Dr White on the other hand saw the plaintiff on 23 March.
His conclusion was that the plaintiff suffers understandable <i>"existential
distress and perhaps existential despair about this case (and probably the
unresolved Police proceedings).  He does not
fulfil the criteria for mental
illness and the Court case is neither necessary nor sufficient cause for mental
illness in any reasonable
person.  From Mr Marsden's point of view, the Court
case is proceedings in an unsatisfactory manner so he is suffering
understandable
emotional distress which he will not decompensate into a mental
disorder regardless of how the case proceeds".  </i>Dr White also expresses the
opinion that "<i>because the capacity for a psychological stressor to
precipitate or perpetuate psychiatric disorder dissipates with the passage of
time ... it will be safe, although, distressing for Mr Marsden to proceed with
the matter.  Furthermore, I believe that he has the
psychological resources to
deal with the variations in the proceedings"</i>.
<P>

224   	Dr White's observations as to the plaintiff's condition
were as follows:  the plaintiff's presentation during the interview
was not
consistent with psychological symptoms;  he did not suffer and has never
suffered from mental illness, he suffered from distress;
 the symptoms
described by the plaintiff pointed to depression, the symptom, not major
depression being a mental illness;  the plaintiff's
symptoms were not
consistent with major depression but pointed to reactive emotional distress.
The various symptoms put to Dr White
in cross-examination as symptoms of major
depression, Dr White said might be due to alcohol abuse.  The activities
engaged in by
the plaintiff including organising the case and continuing as a
partner of a law firm, would not be possible for someone who has
an
incapacitating mental illness.  Importantly, the plaintiff's global clinical
impression was not of a person suffering mental illness.
<P>

225   	It was submitted for the plaintiff that the essential
difference between Dr Dent and Dr White is that Dr Dent says that the
plaintiff
is suffering mental illness whereas Dr White says he is not.  Dr Dent has said
that the plaintiff is suffering a "<i>major depressive episode</i>" (report
dated 1 March 1999) and that his illness of depression has been exacerbated
with the prolongation of the litigation (<i>T676</i>).  He is of the opinion
that it is in the plaintiff's best interest to see the litigation through, no
matter how long it takes, and
with the benefit of his treatment and medication,
the plaintiff can continue with the litigation without risk to his physical and
mental health.  Dr Dent says that the plaintiff can be managed through the
litigation and that the plaintiff will able to cope through
any period of
interruption or postponement as long as he is managed by Dr Dent. 
<P>

226   	Dr White is of the opinion that the plaintiff is not
suffering from major depression or mental illness but distress and that
it is
safe, although distressing, for the plaintiff to proceed with the matter and
that the plaintiff has the psychological resources
to do so.
<P>

227   	For the defendant it is contended that Dr White's views
should be preferred by reason of Dr Dent not having carried out a
full mental
status examination which, on Dr White's evidence, was critical for a proper
assessment of an individual suffering from
mental illness (<i>T714</i>);
indeed, Dr Dent's report did not fulfil the minimum criteria for a medico-legal
report.  There was no history of symptoms, there
was no mental status
examination and there was no assessment of the plaintiff's substance abuse and
alternative stressors.  Dr Dent
carried out no investigation of the plaintiff's
alcohol and marijuana intake.  It is suggested that Dr Dent's comments are
inconsistent
with his treatment responses:  in a brief "<i>corridor</i>"
consultation which led to a note (being part of Exhibit J), Dr Dent notes he
was extremely concerned about the plaintiff but did
not recommend any
hospitalisation (<i>T671</i>).  Dr Dent (<i>T671</i>) recalls that the
plaintiff was concerned about the pressures on him over the two weeks prior to
the consultation on 1 March.  He
cannot recall what the pressures were and did
not take any notes.  In this regard it does appear that Dr Dent was unaware of
the
Police investigation and of the fact that the plaintiff had been
interviewed by the Police on 29 January.  Dr Dent made no inquiry
of any
general practitioner in relation to any medication which had been prescribed
for the plaintiff nor did he, in his diagnosis
of 1 March 1999, refer to or
take notice of the plaintiff's sleep apnoea.  Indeed, Dr Dent did not ascertain
if the plaintiff was
consulting anybody else.
<P>

228   	In relation to the report made on 8 September 1998 Dr
Dent found that the plaintiff was suffering from depression and diagnosed
"<i>mental illness</i>" but provided no treatment nor did he refer the
plaintiff to any specialist.  In short, Dr Dent, the defendant contends, did
not
explore with his patient beyond the matters subjectively conveyed to him by
Mr Marsden.  
<P>

229   	Dr White on the other hand carried out a mental status
examination (Exhibit H), made and recorded relevant clinical observations,
questioned the plaintiff about his alcohol and drug abuse and unlike Dr Dent
did not make a positive diagnosis of mental illness
and therefore would not be
expected to seek corroborative data to positively exclude substance abuse.
<P>

230   	In conclusion for the defendant it is submitted that
accepting Dr Dent's at his highest, he establishes the plaintiff to
be able to
proceed with the litigation, it is in his interests to do so and under the
supervision of Dr Dent and his present regime,
the plaintiff should proceed to
the conclusion of the litigation however long it may take. There is no evidence
to support the proposition
that the plaintiff is presently in an extreme
psychiatric state such that a grant of leave resulting in an adjournment and
delay
will cause him grievous injury or alternatively, that the plaintiff would
experience an extreme psychiatric reaction from an adjournment
occasioned by
the amendment.  Thus, it is submitted, that the plaintiff's condition is not a
factor either of itself or in combination
with others which would prevail over
the injustice of shutting the defendant out from raising the additional
particulars.
<P>

231   	For the plaintiff it is submitted that a review of the
evidence establishes that Mr Marsden already suffers from a severe
form of
psychiatric illness;  that illness may best be characterised as major
depression;  that illness has already been greatly
exacerbated by the events
that have occurred in this litigation since the proceedings were commenced in
1995;  any delay in the resolution
of the truth of the allegations would result
in the further exacerbation of plaintiff's psychiatric condition.  It is
possible that
the granting of the amendments and the consequential adjournment
would result in the plaintiff committing suicide as a result of
the
exacerbation of his psychiatric condition.  This last mentioned component was
never elevated beyond a "<i>possibility</i>" as I understand the plaintiff's
position.
<P>

232   	In addition to the exhibits tendered and the oral
evidence from the two psychiatrists and oral submissions from counsel,
I have
had the benefit and have had regard to the twelve pages of written submissions
lodged by the defendant and the fifteen pages
of written submissions lodged by
the plaintiff.  
<P>

233   	Dr White was trenchantly criticised in submissions and
embarrassed in the course of his evidence by reason of his report
containing
proforma material from his computer that had absolutely nothing to do with the
case.  Furthermore, Dr White was rightly
attacked for his statement in his
report of 25 November 1998 relating to the plaintiff's vocational,
non-vocational, interpersonal
and sexual functioning not suggesting psychiatric
disorder on the one hand, whereas he had history in relation to each of those
four
components that was to the contrary.
<P>

234   	In the end, given the high level to which the psychiatric
condition was elevated for the purposes of the determination of
the amendment
application, after considering the evidence and the impression made upon me by
the testimony of both psychiatrists
and what I read in their reports and the
submissions made by counsel both orally and in writing, I am not persuaded
either that the
plaintiff has a psychiatric illness or that he has a
psychiatric or emotional condition such as to preclude the granting of leave
to
amend if it is otherwise available to the defendant.  I find, notwithstanding
the litany of faults in his report, Dr White to
have been the more objective
examiner of the plaintiff.  I conclude on the probabilities that Mr Marsden
suffers this existential
despair, is of course subject to great distress, but
is not so ill as to require hospitalisation and importantly, on Dr Dent's own
testimony, with Dr Dent's assistance is able to cope.
<P>

235   	There remains the plaintiff's Motion to set aside the
subpoena.  Leaving that to one side for the moment, I can say that
the
defendant has succeeded in persuading me to exercise my discretion to grant
leave to amend.  As I have said I am <i>not </i>satisfied on the evidence that
there has been a want of good faith in the defendant, that there has been
culpable delay, that there
has been no or no proper consideration of the
amendments themselves, that there has been an intention to overreach.  I am
satisfied
that the plaintiff will be able to cope, in the psychiatric context
and has the legal representational resources and an existing
reservoir of
knowledge to minimise the impact of the grant of leave.  The amendment will not
be to the full extent sought.  Appropriate
terms and trial management processes
will be available to accommodate the parties needs and the interests of
justice.
<P>

236   	I turn to the plaintiff's Motion to set aside the
defendant's subpoena dated 18 January 1999 to the New South Wales Police
Service.  The text of the Schedule to the subpoena is appended hereto.
<P>

<b>Submissions for the Plaintiff</b>
<P>

237   	The application is bought pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p37" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 37</a> r 8 which
provides:  "<i>The court may, of its own motion or on the motion of any person
having a sufficient interest, set aside the subpoena wholly or in
part</i>".
<P>

238   	The test of "<i>a sufficient interest</i>" depends upon
"<i>an examination of the connection, if any, between the documents sought to
be required to be produced by the subpoenas in question
on the one hand, and
the [moving party] on the other":<b>  Compsyd Pty Ltd v Streamline Travel
Service Pty Ltd</b></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20648" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 648</a>, at 649G per McClelland J.
<P>

239   	It is submitted that the plaintiff has a "<i>sufficient
interest</i>" for at least five reasons:
<P>

(a)	he is a party to the proceedings; <b><i>Botany Bay Instrumentation &amp;
Control Pty Ltd v Stewart</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20NSWLR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3 NSWLR 98</a>, at 102;
<P>

(b)	the documents contain information which is confidential to the plaintiff:
the material sought to be obtained from the Police
is material which is
obtained by them in the exercise of their statutory powers (see <i>Police
Service Act, 1990 (NSW</i>)).  It must therefore be treated as confidential
regardless of whether or not the information is itself of a confidential
nature<i>:  <b>Johns v ASC</b></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20178%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 178 CLR 408</a>, at 424 per Brennan J
(see also pp.435, 458 and 467).  In any event, regs 55 and 56 of the <i>Police
Service Regulation 1990</i> show that the information is confidential  (see
Supt. Woodhouse under cross-examination at <i>T967.10-13</i>);
<P>

(c)	disclosure of the material the subject of the subpoena would affect the
plaintiff's reputation: it is well established that
if a particular decision
would affect the reputation of an individual he has a right to be heard before
the making of that decision:
 <b><i>Johns v ASC</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d3%29%20178%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-3) 178 CLR 408</a> at
437, 470-471; see also <b><i>Ainsworth v CJC</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 564</a>, at
592.  Disclosure of the documents would have an obvious impact on the
reputation of the plaintiff and this would on its own be
sufficient to ground
standing;
<P>

(d)	production under the subpoena would affect the economic interests of the
plaintiff<i>:  <b>Batemans Bay Land Council v Aboriginal Fund</b></i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72
ALJR 1270</a> shows that indirect economic effect is sufficient to amount to a
sufficient interest under the general law.  Here the impact upon
the
plaintiff's economic interests (viz damages in these two actions) by the
disclosure of the material is a direct economic effect;
<P>

(e)	principles of natural justice require the Police to notify a person under
investigation of the right to be heard before a decision
to disclose Police
investigation documents is taken where that disclosure would be prejudicial to
his interests:  <b><i>Johns v ASC</i></b> at 431;  <b><i>Marcel v Commissioner
of Police of the Metropolis</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20Ch%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] Ch 225</a>; <b><i>Morris v Director of

at 437, 458 and 472<i>.</i>
<P>

240   	In any event, it is clear that the court may set aside a
subpoena of its own motion.  If this happens, the court will obviously
entertain submissions from any party who is prepared to provide such
submissions:  see <b><i>Compsyd</i></b>, at 649G.
<P>

241   	The plaintiff submits that the subpoena should be set
aside for the following reasons:  (a) it is a fishing subpoena;  (b)
the
documents sought have not been sought for a legitimate forensic purpose;  (c)
the documents sought are of no conceivable relevance
to the proceedings;  (d)
the subpoena amounts to discovery against a third party;  (e) the subpoena is
oppressive;  (f) the subpoena
is unintelligible in its form.
<P>

242   	Each of these defects renders the subpoena an abuse of
process:  see Powell J in <b><i>Botany Bay</i></b> at 100-101.
<P>

<b>Fishing</b>
<P>

243   	In <b><i>Commissioner for Railways v Small</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1938/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] NSWStRp 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2038%20SR%28NSW%29%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938)
38 SR(NSW) 564</a> at  575 Jordan CJ quoted Lord Esher MR in <b><i>Hennessy v

drafted "<i>in order that [a party] may find out something of which he knows
nothing now, which might enable him to make a case of which he has
no knowledge
at present</i>".  The relevant paragraphs of the subpoena were drafted in order
to find out whether the Police had any further allegations of under
age sex
against the plaintiff and to use them to mount an amendment application.  They
were also drafted to fish for any "<i>dirt</i>" which the Police had on Mr
Marsden, it is submitted.
<P>

244   	In <b><i>Associated Dominions Assurance Society Pty Ltd v
John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%2072%20WN%28NSW%29%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 72 WN(NSW) 250</a>, at 254, Owen J
(with whom Street CJ and Herron J agreed) noted:  "<i>It is true, as counsel
for the appellant has argued, that a defendant in a libel action who has
pleaded justification is not to be
allowed to go on a mere 'fishing expedition'
into the plaintiff's records in the hope of finding there something which may
supply
him with the evidence necessary to support this plea.  But whether a
particular expedition is a mere 'fishing expedition' depends
upon the meaning
of that phrase.  A 'fishing expedition' in the sense in which the phrase has
been used in the law, means, as I understand
it, that a person who has no
evidence that fish of a particular kind are in a pool desires to be at liberty
to drag it for the purpose
of finding out whether there are any there or not".
</i>His Honour added:  <i>"A defendant who has pleaded justification in libel
is certainly not to be permitted to range at large through the plaintiff's
records
merely because he hopes to find there matters which will enable him to
justify the libel</i>."  These propositions, it is submitted, apply <i>a
fortiori</i> to the position of the Police who are not a party to these
proceedings.
<P>

245   	The terms of the paragraphs in the subpoena show that the
defendant was not simply trying to add to the evidence in the case
as pleaded
but rather to find new complainants and to gather dirt on the plaintiff. 
<P>

246   	This is clear from the face of the subpoena but, if it is
relevant, various items of circumstantial evidence point to "<i>fishing"</i> as
the motivation of the defendant for the subpoena.  This is a case on truth:
the defendant and its solicitors must have been occupied
primarily on this task
since the publication of both matters complained of; and that this was their
focus throughout the latter half
of 1998 and the beginning of 1999.  The
"<i>agreement" </i>which was entered into with the Police in January 1999 shows
that the defendant was prepared to sacrifice everything in the subpoena
provided the 12 new names were provided.  Immediately the names were provided
the defendant sought to amend its pleading to add new
particulars of
justification.  In Ms Barnett's file note of 21 January 1999 it is noted (in
italics) that the defendant would "<i>discover 12 new complainants which we
have not previously been aware of</i>".  In the circumstances, Mr Angus' denial
that the subpoena was a fishing expedition is not credible, it is said.
<P>

<b>No Legitimate Forensic Purpose</b>
<P>

247   	It is submitted that the defendant has been unable to
demonstrate any legitimate forensic purposes for the subpoena.  If
the subpoena
is a fishing expedition there will be no legitimate forensic purpose.  Under
cross-examination Mr Angus suggested that
there were two legitimate forensic
purposes for the subpoena:  to corroborate allegations of truth which are
already in the pleadings;
and to cross-examine the plaintiff.
<P>

248   	As to corroboration, any material which would truly
corroborate a particular complaint which was already in the particulars
would
have been caught by a paragraph drafted so as to be confined to that
particular.  Alternatively, if some specific form of corroboration
were sought
(eg. sex with an under-age boy in a cubicle at Costellos) this would have been
caught by a subpoena drafted so as to
pick up that particular form of
corroboration.  The same comments would apply to material relating to
cross-examination on the issues
directly raised by the justification case in
the pleadings. 
<P>

249   	The defendant's real purpose was to try to "<i>fish"
</i>for material which would lead to new particulars of truth or alternatively
throw up by its broad terms some "<i>dirt</i>" which could be used to
cross-examine the plaintiff on his credit generally.  The defendant should not
be permitted to fish for such
"<i>dirt</i>" any more than it should be able to
"<i>fish"</i> for new particulars.
<P>

<b>Lack of Relevance</b>
<P>

250   	Because it is in such wide terms, the subpoena will pick
up not only material relating to the allegations in the pleadings
but also a
huge amount of totally irrelevant "<i>dirt</i>" which the Police would have on
Mr Marsden.  In this respect the following paragraphs are cited:  
<P>

(a)	allegations that Marsden had engaged in criminal and other activities which
were in conflict with his role as a member of the
NSW Police Board (para
A3);
<P>

(b) 	allegations that Marsden had engaged in homosexual intercourse with
Michael Boda (para A14);
<P>

(c) 	allegations made about Marsden's sexual conduct by Ronald Dunbier (para
A19);
<P>

(d) 	allegations made about Marsden by Daryl Tasker (para A22).
<P>

251   	Each of these categories travels well beyond allegations
of under age sex, let alone under age sex with D1, D2, D3, D5 or
D6.  Indeed,
similar submissions may be made about all of the paragraphs in the subpoena.
For example, of what relevance are the
paragraphs concerning homosexual
intercourse between Marsden and persons (whether or not under-age) who are not
named in the particulars?
 See paras A11-A17.  Further, of what relevance are
allegations (generally) made about Marsden by Daryl Tasker (para A22)?  It
could
not possibly be said, the plaintiff submits, that the material caught by
these extremely wide paragraphs could in any way be relevant
to the proceedings
as they were constituted on 18 January 1999.
<P>

<b>Discovery Against a Third Party</b>
<P>

252   	In <b><i>Small</i></b> at 573 Jordan CJ said:  "<i>A
subpoena duces tecum ought not be issued to [a stranger] requiring him to
search for and produce all such documents as he may have
in his possession or
power relating to a particular subject matter.  It is not legitimate to use a
subpoena for the purpose of endeavouring
to obtain what would be in effect
discovery of documents against a person who, being a stranger, is not liable to
make discovery."</i>
<P>

253   	It is clear that all the paragraphs of the subpoena
relate to all such documents as relate to a particular subject matter.
Further, it is submitted that many of the paragraphs in the subpoena require
judgments to be formed as to what is relevant to certain
issues.
<P>

254   	For example, paragraph A3 requires material relating to
allegations that the plaintiff had engaged in criminal and other
activities
which were in conflict with his role as a member of the NSW Police Board.  This
would obviously require a judgment to
be made which was quite impossible for
the Police to make. (See also paragraphs A1, A2, A4, A5-A23, D and E.)
<P>

<b>Subpoena Oppressive</b>
<P>

255   	In the judgment of 2 March 1999 (DLJT: 18) at paragraph
32 I noted that the subpoena was "<i>extraordinarily wide</i>".  The subpoena
would require the Police to search every Police station in New South Wales to
determine whether any of the very broad
categories of documents listed in the
27 paragraphs are within the  possession, custody or control of any police
officer.  The Police
objected to this subpoena on the ground that it was
oppressive.  The defendant did not dispute this.  This is one of the reasons
why the subpoena was purportedly narrowed "<i>by agreement" </i>so as to be
confined to material known to Detectives Inkster and Woodhouse.
<P>

256   	The Rules do not permit such a reading down by agreement:
SCR Pt 37 r 11.  The reading down would not prevent the subpoena
from being
oppressive.  The only reason the Police were prepared to produce documents was
because they were given a broad discretion
under the "<i>agreement"</i> not to
produce anything over which they wanted to assert a claim for public interest
immunity.  Because the "<i>claim</i>" would cover any document in their
possession, this effectively avoided the oppressiveness from their point of
view.  This too was
an impermissible exercise, it is submitted.
<P>

<b>Defects of Form</b>
<P>

257   	There are various references in the paragraphs of the
subpoena which show that the paragraphs are unclear, ambiguous, uncertain
and
nonsensical.  
<P>

258   	In paragraph A1 there is reference to "allegations of
paedophilia or pederasty against Marsden";  in the judgment of 30 November
1995
(at 6-7), I held that a contextual imputation involving "<i>pederasty"</i>
should be struck out as uncertain;  for the same reasons a paragraph of a
subpoena referring to paedophilia or pederasty is similarly
unclear and
embarrassing (and therefore oppressive).  Paragraph A2 refers to allegations
that the plaintiff "<i>engaged male prostitutes</i>" who were under the age of
18; this is clearly ambiguous; it is not clear what the nature of the
engagement is;  (this is a proposition
I find difficult to accept).  Paragraph
A3 refers to material relating to allegations that the plaintiff "<i>had
engaged in criminal and other activities which were in conflict with his role
as a member of the NSW Police Board</i>".  The evidence shows that the Police
were unable to deal with this particular paragraph, otherwise it is dealt with
above.
<P>

259   	Paragraph C did not refer to documents or records of any
kind; the paragraph refers to "<i>investigations [etc] into allegations that
Marsden had committed criminal offences [etc</i>]".  This I find to be clearly
a typographical error. 
<P>

260   	Paragraph A4 refers to records relating to any
association Marsden had with Colin John Fisk; this is clearly "<i>absurd"</i>
and unclear.  (See also paragraphs A18, A19, A20, A21, A22, A23, D and E.)
<P>

261   	It is contended that in the light of the matters set out
above, I might infer that the defendant is using the amendment application
as
part of a "<i>general tactic"</i> to try to overreach the plaintiff.  As I have
already held with respect to matters other than the subpoena, the defendant
does not
have that intention.  The submissions above are relied upon by the
plaintiff in support of the <i>fourteenth factor</i> - abuse of process.
<P>

262   	The <i>fifteenth factor</i> is that the proposed
amendment is the fruit of that abuse of process.
<P>

263   	The plaintiff submits that a further independent
discretionary reason for refusing the proposed amendments is that they are
the
fruit of three "<i>gross"</i> abuses of process to which the defendant was a
party, being (a) the procurement by the defendant of the issue on 18 January
1999
of a subpoena which was a gross abuse of process;  (b) the agreement
between the Police and the defendant entered into in late January
1999 whereby
the Police and the defendant "<i>agreed"</i> that the Police would transfer (at
their discretion) any "<i>dirt"</i> which they had on Mr Marsden under the
cover of the subpoena dated 18 January;  (c) transferring the documents in
accordance with
the agreement by using the procedures of the Supreme Court.
<P>

264   	It is submitted that the court should not "<i>reward"</i>
these abuses of process by allowing the defendant to amend using the products
of those abuses.  The proposed amendment is founded
solely on the documents
produced by the Police.  The defendant does not assert any other source of
information for the material on
which the amendment is based.
<P>

265   	The Police are bound, it is said, by obligations of
confidence and impartiality (the <i>sixteenth factor</i>).  The Police duties
of confidentiality in relation to investigative material derive from two
sources:  the <i>Police Service Regulations 1990 (NSW</i>) and the <i>Police
Service Act 1990 (NSW).</i>
<P>

266   	Regulation 55 provides as follows (under the heading
"Confidential Information"):
<P>

<i>"A police officer must treat all information which comes to the officer's
knowledge in his or her official capacity as strictly confidential,
and on no
account without proper authority divulge to anyone."</i>
<P>

267   	Regulation 56 (headed "<i>Secrecy in Official
Matters</i>") provides:
<P>

<i>"Without affecting the generality of clause 55, a police officer must
observe the strictest secrecy in regard to police service business,
and is
forbidden to communicate without proper authority in any way whatever to any
person outside the police service any information
in regard to police or other
official public business connected with his or her duties, or which may come to
his or her knowledge
in the performance of them."</i>
<P>

268   	The<i> Police Service Act</i> requires that any
information obtained in the exercise of the police's powers of investigation
must be treated as confidential whether
or not the information obtained is
otherwise of a confidential nature.  That was made clear by Brennan J in
<b><i>Johns</i></b> at 424:
<P>

<i>"A statute which confers a power to obtain information for a purpose
defines, expressly or impliedly, the purpose for which the information
when
obtained can be used or disclosed.  The statute imposes on the person who
obtains information in exercise of the power a duty
not to disclose the
information obtained except for that purpose.  If it were otherwise, the
definition of the particular purpose
would impose no limit on the use or
disclosure of the information.  The person obtaining information in exercise of
such a statutory
power must therefore treat the information obtained as
confidential whether or not the information is otherwise of a confidential
nature".  </i>(See also Dawson J at 435, Gaudron J at 458 and McHugh J at
467.)
<P>

269   	It is submitted that before such confidential
investigative material is disclosed by the Police, the Police have an
obligation
to disclose to the person whose interests may be prejudiced by the
disclosure that a decision to disclose may be made.  This is in
order to allow
the person whose interest may be prejudiced a right to be heard before
disclosure occurs:  see <b><i>Johns</i></b> at 431 per Brennan J citing
<b><i>Marcel </i></b>and <b><i>Morris</i></b>.  As Dillon LJ observed in
<b><i>Marcel </i></b>at 259B:  "<i>Even where a subpoena has been served, the
police should not disclose seized documents to the advisers of a party to civil
proceedings
in advance of the attendance at court required by the subpoena,
unless at the least the police have first given to the true owner
of the
documents notice of the service of the subpoena and of the wish of the police
to produce the documents in advance of the attendance
at court required by the
subpoena, and have given the true owner a reasonable opportunity to state his
objections, if any, to that
course.</i>"  (See also the statement of Nolan J at
261D).
<P>

270   	It follows, it is said, that the Police were under the
strictest obligations of confidentiality in relation to any investigative
material in their possession and were only permitted to disclose the material
if it was caught by a valid subpoena and Mr Marsden
had been given a  proper
opportunity to object to the subpoena or production of documents under it.  It
was certainly not open to
the Police to use an "<i>extraordinarily wide</i>"
subpoena as the basis for entering into an "<i>agreement"</i> under which
confidential material could be transferred from the hands of the Police to the
defendant by the procedures of the court
for production of subpoenaed
documents.
<P>

271   	With these asserted obligations of confidentiality in
mind, attention is given to what is said to be the evidence of the
"<i>agreement"</i> between the Police and the defendant.  (Exhibit 11,
especially tabs 29, 32, 35, 36, 31, 32, 37, the affidavits of Mr Angus, Mr
Woodhouse
and the cross-examination of those witnesses.)  More particular
references to the evidence are given in the chronology which follows:

re D24 and D25;  Angus affidavit 5/3/99, para 10; Exhibit IRA-2.
<P>

273   	The relevant terms of the agreement are said to be as
follows:
<P>

(a)	that the Commissioner of Police produce, without objection to access, all
documents caught by the subpoena which were known
to Detective Superintendent
Michael Woodhouse or Detective Acting Superintendent Bob Inkster and which were
not the subject of an
assertion by the Police of public interest immunity (see
Crown Solicitor's letter dated 25 January 1998 (it should be 1999) and MSJ
letter dated 25 January 1999:  Exhibit 11, tabs 35 and 36);
<P>

(b)	that these documents include "<i>12 new complainants</i>" (Mr Angus'
handwritten note of the meeting with Mr Singleton of 21 January 1999 and Ms
Barnett's typed file note of that same meeting:
 Exhibit 11, tabs 31 and
32);
<P>

(c)	that the defendant had a "<i>right to withdraw if there were less names
than proposed (10)</i>":  see Crown Solicitor's file note of meeting with Mr
Woodhouse on 27 January 1999:  Exhibit 11, tab 37;
<P>

(d)	that the documents be produced "<i>without fanfare</i>" in the Registry (Ms
Barnett's file note of 21 January 1999:  Exhibit 11, tab 32);
<P>

(e)	that the agreement not be disclosed to Phillips Fox:  see Ms Barnett's file
note of the telephone call from Mr Singleton of
20 January 1999 and Ms
Barnett's file note of 21 January 1999:  Exhibit 11, tabs 29 and 32;
<P>

(f)	that the defendant "<i>waive further compliance with the subpoena</i>":
see the letters of 25 January 1999 being Exhibit 11, tabs 35 and 36.
<P>

274   	Several aspects of this "<i>agreement"</i> are said to be
notable:
<P>

(a)	although the subpoena is an abuse of process there was no attempt by the
Police to have it set aside although they knew it was
an abuse of process and
made their views clear to the defendant;
<P>

(b)	the material caught by the subpoena was clearly the subject of a claim for
public interest immunity based on current investigations
and material relating
to informers;
<P>

(c)	both in the "<i>agreement</i>" and in the way it was executed it was left
to the Police to determine whether documents were the subject of public
interest immunity
rather than the court; claims for public interest immunity
are the responsibility of the judicial branch of government, not the executive
branch:  see <b><i>Sankey v Whitlam</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20142%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 142 CLR 1</a>, at 58-60.  It is
not open to the Police as part of the executive government to aggregate to
themselves the judicial function of
determining what documents are to be
subject to public interest immunity.  Because, at least prima facie, all of the
documents caught
by the subpoena in the agreement would be the subject of
public interest immunity, this effectively gave the Police a complete
discretion
to produce whatever material they wanted.
<P>

(d)	no subpoena could validly have been issued in terms of the agreement;
<P>

(e)	the effect of the agreement was to enable the Police to produce any
"<i>dirt</i>" which they had on Mr Marsden which was known to Superintendent
Woodhouse or Superintendent Inkster, the Police having a complete
discretion as
to what documents were to be produced.
<P>

275   	In addition, the evidence, it is said, demonstrates the
following:
<P>

276   	First, that the defendant entered the agreement for the
improper purpose of obtaining 12 new complainants on which to base
an
amendment.
<P>

277   	The issue of the truth of the imputations has always been
the primary issue in this case and the defendant has known that
ever since the
first broadcast.  There is no issue, it is said, between the parties that the
defendant has spent the last four years
trying to find evidence of the truth of
the imputations.  In the period at the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999
the defendant
was working "<i>furiously"</i> to find fresh allegations which
were not in the particulars in order to incorporate them in this case (see
D13-D16).  So concerned
was the defendant to obtain details of these fresh
allegations investigated by the Police that Mr Angus and Mr Quail were in
contact
with Mr Woodhouse to try to bring this about.  The subpoena in its
terms is a "<i>fishing"</i> subpoena designed to catch new complainants in the
possession of the Police.  When the Police pointed out the problems with this
subpoena the defendant was prepared to ditch the whole of the subpoena provided
that it got<i> "12 new complainants</i>".  The evidence demonstrates that the
primary interest of the defendant and the solicitors acting for it was the
presence of 12 new
complainants in the subpoenaed material (see the italicised
portion of Ms Barnett's file note of 21 January 1999 (Exhibit 11, tab
32);  see
also Exhibit 11, tab 50 and 52).  As soon as the "<i>12 new complainants</i>"
were received by the defendant there was immediately an application to amend.
The evidence also establishes that if the 12 names
were not provided the
defendant was prepared to issue a fresh subpoena;  this indicates that if the
12 new names were provided, the
defendant was satisfied, which indicates that
its purpose in entering the agreement was solely to obtain those 12 new names.
In the
circumstances, it is clear that the defendant's only intention in
entering into this agreement was to obtain the names of 12 new
complainants for
the purposes of making an amendment application.  This means that the agreement
was entered into wholly for the
purpose of engaging in a fishing expedition.

<P>

278   	Secondly, the evidence shows that the Police entered into
the agreement for the sole improper purpose of obtaining an adjournment
of the
civil proceedings.
<P>

279   	There was a desire on the part of the Police (especially
Superintendent Woodhouse) to obtain an adjournment of the civil
proceedings, it
is submitted.  This was no minor matter to the Police but rather a view on
their part that if there was no adjournment
this would prejudice the whole of
the criminal proceedings because, in their view, the criminal proceedings could
not go ahead if
the civil proceedings were heard first.  So great was the
desire of the Police to obtain an adjournment or stay of the civil proceedings
that a decision was made to seek advice from the Solicitor-General:  Woodhouse
affidavit 2 March 1999:  annexure G.  The advice received
was that no
adjournment of the civil proceedings could be obtained on the application of
the Police:  Woodhouse 2 March 1999, paragraph
26(a).  The Police were thus
thwarted in their desires and intentions and were otherwise unable to find any
means of delaying the
civil proceedings.  
<P>

280   	At about this time in January 1999 (soon after the advice
was received) the subpoena from the defendant dated 18 January
1999 arrived.
Immediately the subpoena was received "<i>negotiations"</i> were commenced with
the defendant to provide the new names, notwithstanding that the Police knew
that the subpoena was invalid and
an abuse of process.  The "<i>agreement"
</i>was entered into notwithstanding that the Police had previously claimed
public interest immunity when the plaintiff had sought such
material and when
the Police knew that the material sought by the defendant was also subject to a
claim for public interest immunity.
 The Police did not obtain the consent of
any of the informers for the production of the material to the defendant.
There is no other
means available to the Police to obtain an adjournment of the
civil proceedings.  "<i>Any fool" </i>would know that if 12 new complainants
were dropped into a civil case there would necessarily be an adjournment of
great length.
<P>

281   	Notwithstanding their duties of confidentiality and
impartiality the Police not only failed to notify the plaintiff that
these
documents were to be produced but entered into a specific agreement with the
defendant not to disclose to the plaintiff the
existence of the agreement and
the production of the documents under that agreement.  Accordingly, it is
submitted, it is clear that
the police's only or primary purpose in entering
into this agreement was to effect an adjournment of the proceedings.
<P>

282   	Thirdly, the agreement was in breach of the police's
duties of confidentiality. 
<P>

283   	The Police were only permitted to disclose the documents
sought pursuant to a valid subpoena (and this subpoena was not valid).
 In any
event, the documents were produced under the "<i>agreement"</i> not the
subpoena and the Police had no power under the <i>Police Service Act </i>to
enter into the agreement which was in conflict not only with their obligations
of confidence under that Act but also directly in
conflict with the Police
Regulations.  At a bare minimum, the police's obligations of confidentiality
required that the plaintiff
be informed of the possibility of an agreement to
effect disclosure, the existence of the subpoena and its terms so that the
plaintiff
would have the opportunity of either setting aside the subpoena or
alternatively preventing access from being granted to the defendant.
<P>

284   	In this context it is argued that it is notable that Mr
Angus said that he only wanted the documents the subject of the subpoena
for
corroboration and for cross-examination of the plaintiff;  if that attitude was
made clear to a judge dealing with access, access
(if granted) would only have
been on the basis of an undertaking by the defendant not to use the material
for the purposes of an
amendment application.
<P>

285   	The specific "<i>agreement"</i> not to disclose the
agreement and the "<i>clandestine"</i> arrangements between the Police and the
defendant were themselves in breach of the police's duties of confidence.
<P>

286   	Fourthly, it is said, the agreement was in breach of the
police duty of impartiality for the following reasons.  The Police
consistently
refused to produce documents sought by the plaintiff on the ground that there
was no legitimate forensic purpose and
that the documents were the subject of
public interest immunity.  Notwithstanding that a much wider class of documents
was sought
by the defendant the Police were willing to produce these documents
because it suited their purposes.  The requirements of impartiality
also
required that there be notification to the plaintiff of the foreshadowed
production, the possibility of an agreement and of
the nature of the documents
sought to be produced so that the plaintiff could avail himself of any remedy
available to him.
<P>

287   	Reliance is also placed on the following matters:
<P>

(a)	Exhibit 11, tab 50 wherein it is noted that Mr Singleton pointed out to Mr
Price that of the vast quantity of documents produced
"<i>there was only about
another two folders or so of `really interesting' material</i>";
<P>

(b)	Mr Singleton pointed out to Ms Barnett that "there was clear material in
the John Martin subpoena of Marsden attempting to pervert
the course of
justice":  Exhibit 11, tab 41;
<P>

(c)	it is clear that the names which were disclosed to Mr Quail in early
February 1999 could only have come from the Police.
<P>

288   	It is submitted, the plaintiff should have been given the
right to be heard before the Police entered the agreement and produced
the
documents.  The only "<i>honourable" </i>thing for the Police to do was to
notify the plaintiff of what was happening.  However, if the Police had so
notified the plaintiff
it would have frustrated the very purpose which they
were attempting to effect, namely, the adjournment of the proceedings.  If the
plaintiff had found out about what the Police and the defendant were attempting
to do, the plaintiff could have taken steps to prevent
the defendant from
getting the documents.
<P>

289   	The distributive reading down of the subpoena coupled
with the right of the Police to keep any documents which they claimed
to be
subject to public interest immunity plus the purported dispensation by the
defendant with further compliance with the subpoena
gave the Police a complete
discretion as to what to produce - this was a wholly impermissible and
illegitimate exercise, so the plaintiff
contends.
<P>

290   	The only power to excuse the recipient of a subpoena from
compliance with the subpoena is contained in SCR Pt 37 r 11:
<P>

<i>"Where the person named or, where the person named is a corporation, the
proper officer of the corporation has not -</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	been called to give evidence; or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	been called upon to produce documents, </i>
<P>

<i>before the court or before any judge, officer, examiner or other person
having authority to take evidence, in compliance with a subpoena,
the party who
requested the issue of the subpoena may by written or oral notice to the person
named, excuse the person named from
compliance with the subpoena."</i>
<P>

291   	It is submitted that the only power which the issuing
party has is to tell a subpoenaed party before he is called upon to
produce any
documents that he is completely excused from compliance with the subpoena.
This provision could not be read as a power
granted to the issuing party to
read down the subpoena in any way.  Such an arrangement could be in clear
breach of the <i>Crimes Act</i>:  see s 373.  
<P>

292   	In the present case, the impugned agreement was an
impermissible reading down in two respects:
<P>

(a)	the whole subpoena was read down distributively so as to only apply to
documents known to Detectives Inkster and Woodhouse;
<P>

(b)	that reading down was further read down distributively so that the Police
need only produce such documents as they desired to
produce (given that they
were to determine any issue of public interest immunity).
<P>

293   	The essence of the plaintiff's complaint is that the
court should not condone the above abuses of process by permitting an
amendment
based upon material which is the result of a conspiracy between the Police and
the defendant illegitimately to transfer
confidential Police investigative
material to the defendant using the subpoena procedures of the court when both
the Police and the
defendant were wholly motivated by illegitimate and improper
purposes, namely, to effect an adjournment of the proceedings and to
fish for
further particulars of justification.  "<i>This whole thing was a gross abuse
from start to finish"</i>.  Further, all of the material obtained has been
obtained improperly and illegally and is prima facie not to be admitted in the
proceedings
"<i>unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the
undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the
way in which
the evidence was obtained</i>":  s 138 <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.
<P>

294   	One final matter, it is said, should also be noted.  The
defendant was under an obligation to make a full and frank disclosure
of all
matters relevant to its amendment application.  It is notable that two key
facts material to the abuse of process dealt with
above namely the Woodhouse
meeting of 20 February 1999 and the Angus/Singleton meeting of 21 February 1999
were not disclosed to
the court in either the affidavits of Superintendent
Woodhouse or Mr Angus.   In the circumstances, this is also a matter material
to the court's  discretion to grant or disallow the amendments sought.  The
explanations given on behalf of the defendant for the
non-disclosure should not
be accepted:  see T824, T825, T830 and T832.  See also the defendant's
chronology part of Exhibit 11 which
omits references to these events.
<P>

<b>Submissions For Defendant</b>
<P>

295   	The order to the NSW Police Service to produce documents
was obeyed by production of documents to the Court on 1, 5, 11 February
and 9
March.  The purpose of the order which required production of documents to the
Court has been fulfilled.  The order no longer
is of operative effect, the
recipient having complied with it.  It is no longer enforceable against the
recipient.
<P>

296   	SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p37" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 37</a> r 8 enables the Court to set aside a subpoena
which continues to be effective in that it requires production of documents.
The power
to set aside is in respect of an order which presently affects the
rights or interests of a person (whether the recipient or another
person).
Thus an order to set aside, if made, will have the result that the subpoena
will thereafter no longer operate and be enforceable
against the recipient.  An
order to set aside a subpoena could have no retrospective operation.
<P>

297   	In the circumstances of this case the Court has no
jurisdiction under the Rule because the requirements of the subpoena are
spent
or discharged.  There is nothing of substance to be set aside or stayed.
<P>

<b>Discretion</b>
<P>

298   	In the alternative to the above, the power to set aside
is discretionary and, having regard to the circumstances of this
case, the
Court should decline to order the relief sought.
<P>

299   	The subpoena, like any order of the Court, cannot be
treated as a nullity <i>ab initio</i>.  Unless and until it is set aside it
stands, and must be obeyed.  It was obeyed by production on 1, 5, 11 February
and 9 March.
 The order is spent and no longer has continuing operative effect.
It is no longer enforceable against the recipient.  Its purpose
has been
fulfilled.
<P>

<i>"So long as the earlier decision stands, and no stay is operative, it is a
lawful decision and the action taken in reliance upon it
is lawful.  It is true
that from the moment it is set aside the order can no longer provide the lawful
justification for further
action, but whether what has been done can be undone
will depend upon the availability of appropriate remedies, to bring about the
appropriate relief."  <b>Wilde v Australian Trade Equipment Co Pty Limited
</b></i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20145%20CLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 145 CLR 590</a> at p 603.
<P>

300   	Furthermore, the plaintiff chose to move to preserve its
interest in the documents produced on grounds other than that the
subpoena was
an abuse of process.  Having had access to the documents before the defendant
did, the plaintiff chose to protect any
interest he had in them by asserting
claims for client professional privilege and public interest immunity.  The
result is that in
respect of those documents in which the plaintiff has an
interest which required protection he has obtained orders of the Court which
afford the necessary protection.  Production of the documents by the recipient
took place over a number of days.  The recipient had
performed its obligations
by 9 March.  The plaintiff asserted his claim for privilege over certain of the
documents produced.  As
has been acknowledged in Court on behalf of the
plaintiff, documents over which no claim for privilege was made included the
statements
of those witnesses who are now the subject of the further amendment
application (before Hulme J; 24 February, p 3).  Access was granted
to the
defendant in respect of that material without opposition from the plaintiff.
The plaintiff has had possession of a copy of
all of the material produced
since the time of its production to the Court.  He has used it extensively for
the purpose of the criminal
investigation and in the present proceedings.  (eg:
Lee, Affidavit 20 April, Gillingham, Affidavits 17 March, 12 April, Potter:
Affidavit
2 March).
<P>

301   	The defendant has had access to such of the documents
produced in respect of which no claim has been made by the plaintiff
since 11
February 1999.
<P>

302   	An earlier motion to set aside was filed on 24 February.
(Hulme J, 24 February, p 3).  The ground relied upon was that the
subpoena was
<i>"too wide and fishing in its nature"</i> (before Hulme J, 24 February 1999,
p 4).  It was adjourned and brought before me on 2 March.  After discussion the
motion was dismissed
(<i>T124</i>).
<P>

303   	The issue of abuse as alleged was not raised until 12
March.
<P>

304   	In any event, no order should be made.  In the
circumstances the plaintiff has waived any entitlement he had to move to set
aside the subpoena.  He himself has proceeded in reliance upon the validity of
the subpoena by making use of the documents produced
in the way referred to,
and to move on the basis that he did to protect his interest in some of those
documents.  He has been aware
that the defendant has acted in reliance upon the
remainder of the documents produced in respect of which he has made no claim.
He
chose to move to deny use of documents on grounds other than abuse of
process, having had access to them before the defendant.  It
is now too late to
move to deny access on a different ground in a different application.
<P>

305   	A further ground for rejecting the application is that
the recipient, the NSW Police Service, elected to waive any entitlement
it had
to challenge the validity of the subpoena on any ground.  
<P>

306   	The recipient had the standing to move to set aside the
subpoena in whole or in part had it seen fit to object to any of
its
requirements.  However, it came to an arrangement with the defendant, the party
which caused the subpoena to be issued.  The
effect of the arrangement was that
the defendant accepted the recipient's claim of public interest immunity in
respect of some documents
under the subpoena, thereby avoiding the need to
litigate that claim, and the recipient produced the remainder of the documents
called
for without objection.  The recipient produced the documents in respect
of which it made no claim for public interest immunity consistent
with the
arrangement.  In the circumstances the recipient elected to abandon any
entitlement it had to challenge the subpoena and
compliance with it was
accepted on that basis.
<P>

307   	Further, the delay in making this application is a ground
for rejecting it in the exercise of the Court's discretion.  The
delay is
unexplained and is unreasonable in the circumstances.  Miss Gillingham became
aware of the first page of the subpoena when
she attended to inspect documents
produced under it on 1 February 1999.  (Gillingham Affidavit 17 March paras 10,
11; <i>T1081</i>).  She did not get around to asking for a full copy from the
Crown Solicitor or anyone else (<i>T1082</i>).  No motion was filed until 24
February; it was dismissed on 2 March (see above).
<P>

308   	It was open to the plaintiff to file and proceed with a
motion to set aside at least from 1 February.  This delay in doing
so in all
the circumstances justifies rejection of the relief sought.  (cf: <b><i>Wran v
ABC</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%203%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 3 NSWLR 241</a> at 268).
<P>

<b>Standing of Plaintiff (Defendant's Submissions)</b>
<P>

309   	It is necessary that the applicant establish "<i>a
sufficient interest</i>" that the order to produce the documents be set aside.
It is not simply a matter of right.  The mere fact of being a party does not
establish a sufficient interest<i>.  (<b>Compsyd</b></i>; <b><i>Wran v ABC</i>;
<i>Marcel</i></b>).  To establish a sufficient interest a person needs to
demonstrate that his or her legal rights in connection with the documents
will
be interfered with by the execution of the subpoena.
<P>

310   	In this case, the plaintiff does not have an interest
which gives him standing to set aside the subpoena in respect of documents
which are not the subject of his client professional privilege.
<P>

311   	The plaintiff, in separate proceedings, moved to preserve
his interest in certain of the documents produced, and thereby
denied the
defendant access to them.  His claims have been determined.  To the extent that
the Plaintiff's interest in the documents
required, it has been, and is,
protected by orders of the Court.  It is submitted that the plaintiff has no
interest within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 8</a> in the remainder of the documents in
respect of which no claim of privilege is asserted.  Further, the plaintiff has
no standing
to challenge the validity of the subpoena upon grounds relevant
only to the interest of the recipient, the NSW Police Service (for
example,
that it is a fishing subpoena, is oppressive, or is unintelligible in form).
<P>

<b>Defendant's Chronology and analysis of evidence</b>
<P>

312   	On 18 January 1999 Mr Angus caused the subpoena to be
issued.
<P>

313   	By 18 January 1999 the defendant had served the plaintiff
with particulars of truth in respect of D13, D14, and D15.  (See
affidavit of
R.W. Potter made 12 March 1999 paras 7 and 8).
<P>

314   	At no time prior to the subpoena being issued was there a
discussion between Mr Angus and any representative of the NSW Police
in
relation to the issuing of a subpoena (<i>T514.10</i>; affidavit of Angus made
13 April 1999 para 2).
<P>

315   	By 18 January 1999 the defendant was aware that
Superintendent Woodhouse was investigating allegations made against the
plaintiff
by D15 and D16.  On 8 December 1998 Woodhouse wrote to the solicitors
for the defendant requesting that D15 and D16 not be interviewed
by the
solicitors for the defendant (affidavit of Angus made 18 February 1999 Annexure
"<i>A</i>").
<P>

316   	Mr Angus' purpose in issuing the subpoena was:
<P>

(a)	to obtain material upon which to cross-examine the plaintiff (in the light
of the plaintiff's assertion for each of the imputations
upon which he sued was
believed by him to be false) <i>(T519.25-30</i>);
<P>

(b)	to obtain material relating to the particulars of truth already alleged
(<i>T519.25-30</i>).
<P>

317   	On 20 January 1999 at 12:50pm there was a meeting between
Woodhouse, Mr Singleton from the Crown Solicitor's Office, Mr Howard
from the
NSW Police, Ms Tomlin from the Crown Solicitor's Office, and Superintendent
Inkster to discuss the defendant's subpoena.
 (See affidavit of Mr Woodhouse
made 14 April 1999 paras 6-12 and Annexure "<i>A</i>" thereto). Mr Woodhouse
advised Singleton of the documents held by him in relation to which he had no
objection to production.  These
documents included the names of about a dozen
persons who had made allegations against the plaintiff which had been
investigated
by the Police (affidavit of Woodhouse made 14 April 1999 para
9).
<P>

318   	At about 3:25pm on 20 January 1999 Singleton telephoned
Ms Rebecca Barnett of Mallesons Stephen Jaques to arrange a meeting
for the
following day at 3:30pm (see affidavit of Barnett made 13 April 1999 paras 2-5
and Annexures "<i>A</i>" and "<i>B</i>" thereto and Exhibit 11, tabs 29 and
30).
<P>

319   	Prior to the meeting on 21 January 1999 Angus was unaware
that the material to be produced by the Police contained the names
of
approximately a dozen persons who had not been particularised by the defendant
(<i>T855</i>).
<P>

320   	On 21 January 1999 there was a meeting at Mallesons
Stephen Jaques between Barnett, Angus, Singleton and Tomlin.  Singleton
offered
to produce some documents caught by the subpoena in relation to which no public
interest was claimed.  This material included
12 new complainants (see
affidavit of Barnett paras 6-13 Annexure "C" affidavit of Angus 13 April 1999
paras 8-10 Annexure "<i>F</i>" and "<i>G</i>" Exhibit 11, tabs 31 and 32).
<P>

321   	At the meeting on 21 January 1999 (as recorded in the
file note made by Barnett) Mr Singleton on behalf of the NSW Police
said that
the Police would be prepared to produce records under paras B and C of the
subpoena (namely records) in relation to which
there was no public interest
immunity claim (in relation to the investigations by Superintendents Inkster
and Woodhouse).  Further,
the Police would produce material in relation to
paras D and E of the subpoena so far as that material was known to Inkster or
Woodhouse.
<P>

322   	In relation to the "<i>offer</i>" made by the Police
Angus said a discussion took place, the effect of which was, that in its form,
in the view of Mr Singleton, the
subpoena could be challenged.  Singleton
indicated that a limited call of the subpoena was possible and that if the
defendant accepted
the limited call, there would be no application to set aside
the subpoena.
<P>

323   	On 22 January 1999 Mallesons Stephen Jaques requested
instructions on whether or not to accept the Crown's offer (see affidavit
of
Barnett para 14 and Annexure "<i>D</i>").
<P>

324   	On 22 January 1999 at 3:10pm Counsel for the defendant
advised that the offer be accepted (<i>T885</i>).  At approximately 3:30pm
General Counsel of the defendant gives instructions to accept the offer
(<i>T889-890</i>).  At 3:45pm on 22 January 1999 Barnett telephoned Tomlin and
notified her that the defendant would accept the offer (see affidavit
of
Barnett para 15 Annexure "<i>E</i>").
<P>

325   	On 25 January 1999 Tomlin telephoned Barnett and
requested the return date for the subpoena be stood over to 29 January 1999.
The Crown Solicitor's Office advised Mallesons Stephen Jaques of the terms upon
which the subpoena would be answered (see affidavit
of Barnett paras 16-17
Annexures "<i>F</i>" and "<i>G</i>").  On 25 January 1999 Mallesons Stephen
Jaques advised the Crown Solicitor's Office by letter of the defendant's
acceptance of the
offer and agreed to stand over the return date of the
subpoena to 29 January 1999.  (See affidavit of Barnett para 18 Annexure
"<i>H</i>").  On 27 January 1999, (the first return date of the subpoena) the
defendant arranged for the subpoena to be stood over to 1 February
1999.  (See
affidavit of Gillingham made 17 March 1999 para 8).  At 2:00pm on 27 January
1999 there was a meeting between Woodhouse,
Halcro, Bell, Howard, Inkster,
Rudolph, Tomlin and Singleton to address the subpoenas served by the plaintiff
and the defendant.
 At the meeting it was agreed that the position taken
previously on 20 January 1999 had changed substantially and that more documents
could be produced in response to the subpoena.  (See affidavit of Woodhouse
made 2 March 1999 paras 23-27 and affidavit of Woodhouse
made 14 April 1999
paras 16-18 Annexure "<i>D</i>".
<P>

326   	Exhibit 11, tab 38 is Woodhouse's policy log of the
meeting at 2:00pm on 27 January 1999.  At para 80 it records:
<P>

<i>"At 2:00pm on Wednesday 27 January 1999 Detective Superintendent Woodhouse
and Detective Senior Constable Halcro attended a conference
at the premises of
the Crown Solicitor.  The meeting was also attended by Howard Bell and James
Howard representing Police Solicitors
and Detective Superintendent Inkster/DS
Rudolph re the original investigation into John Marsden.</i>
<P>

<i>The purpose of the meeting was to address the subpoena which had been served
upon the police by solicitors acting for both John Marsden
and Channel 7
TV.</i>
<P>

<i>So far as it concerned the material available to Strike Force Cori, it was
agreed that this should be collated into three categories:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	The material upon which the police did not intend to rely and for which
no public interest immunity could be sought.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The material relating to D15 and D16 which had been specifically
subpoenaed by solicitors acting for John Marsden, but which was
also caught by
the 'all-encompassing' nature of the subpoena issued by Channel 7's
lawyers.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	The material relating to allegations made against John Marsden by other
witnesses which may form the basis of a report to The Director
of Public
Prosecutions or other consideration of a criminal prosecution.</i>
<P>

<i>It was agreed that the police position had changed in respect of this
material because of the following factors:-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	The police had made an unsuccessful application to the Solicitor General
for a stay of proceedings in the civil case to ensure
that the public interest
as represented by a criminal investigation was considered first.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	D15 and D16 had been subpoenaed and would be called to give evidence in
the Civil matter, regardless of the police position. 
It was now in the
interest of justice that the whole of the evidence available on this matter
should be made available to the court.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	John Marsden had agreed to be interviewed by the police on 29 January
1999 when all the allegations upon which the police were
considering to proceed
would be put to him.  After this date public interest immunity may well have
expired.</i>
<P>

<i>In view of these factors it was agreed:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	That documents etc. at para 1. should be served after editing to
eliminate matters where public interest immunity is sought. 
The size and
complexity of the preparation was noted.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	That documents at paras 2-3 may be served after 29 January subject to
the proviso that public interest immunity may arise from
the requirement to
perform further investigations in consequence of the interview with John
Marsden.  All documents should be edited
to remove material already attracting
public interest immunity.</i>
<P>

<i>A further meeting was scheduled for 4:00pm Monday 1 February 1999 to
finalise the police position after interviews with John Marsden".</i>
<P>

327   	On 28 January 1999 Mallesons informed the Crown
Solicitor's Office that the subpoena had been stood over to 29 January 1999.
(See affidavit of Barnett para 19 Annexure "<i>I</i>").
<P>

328   	On 29 January 1999 Woodhouse interviewed the
plaintiff.
<P>

329   	On 1 February 1999 the first of the Police documents were
produced to the Court.  Ms Gillingham attended Exhibits Office,
inspected
material produced by the Police, claimed legal professional privilege over some
of the material and arranged for all of
the other material to be photocopied.
(See affidavit of Gillingham made on 17 March 1999 paragraph 10 and
<i>T1080-1086</i>).
<P>

330   	On 1 February 1999 at 4:00pm there was a meeting between
Woodhouse, Inkster and Crown Solicitor.  At the meeting Woodhouse
advised that
his interview with the plaintiff had been conducted and that no further
significant investigations remained.  Woodhouse
advised he had no objection to
both parties being given access to the documents requested on subpoena subject
to selection and editing
for public interest immunity.  (See affidavit of
Woodhouse made 14 April 1999 paras 20-22 Annexure "<i>E</i>").  Between 1
February 1999 and 9 February 1999 Woodhouse edited those documents held by the
Police which he considered subject to
public interest immunity protection and
produced the edited material to Singleton on 9 February 1999.  (See affidavit
of Woodhouse
made 14 April 1999 para 23).
<P>

331   	On 4 February 1999 Barnett and Gillingham attended the
return of the subpoena.  Barnett had the subpoena stood over to 8
February
1999.  Later in the day, I granted access to all parties to documents produced
by the Police.  (See affidavit of Gillingham
made 17 March 1999 paras 13 and
14).
<P>

332   	On 5 February 1999 Gillingham attended Exhibits Office,
inspected additional material produced by the Police, claimed legal
professional privilege over some of it and arranged for all material to be
photocopied.  (See affidavit of Gillingham made 17 March

<P>

333   	On 8 February 1999 Barnett and Gillingham attend the
return of the subpoena.  Barnett has the subpoena stood over to 11 February
1999.  (See affidavit of Gillingham 17 March 1999 para 16).
<P>

334   	On 11 February 1999 the NSW Police produced three boxes
of material in answer to the defendant's subpoena including the Police
statements contained in Exhibit IRA1 (Exhibit F) and IRA2 (Exhibit E).
Gillingham attended the Exhibits Office, skim read the documents,
claimed legal
professional privilege over some of the material and arranged for all of the
material to be photocopied.  (See affidavit
of Gillingham 17 March 1999 paras
18-20;  affidavit of Angus made 5 March 1999 paras 3 and 4).
<P>

335   	On 12 February 1999 Tomlin produced a folder of documents
to the Court in answer to the subpoena issued by the defendant
and the
plaintiff.  I granted access to both parties to uplift the material.  The
plaintiff obtained first access until 10:00am on
Monday 15 February 1999.
Gillingham inspected the material and claimed client legal privilege on behalf
of the plaintiff in respect
of some of it.  (See affidavit of Gillingham 17
March 1999 paras 22-23).
<P>

336   	On 12 February 1999 the plaintiff obtained copies of all
of the material produced by the NSW Police, and then delivered copies
to Mr Lee
solicitor from Corrs Chambers Westgarth (<i>T1255.25-35, T1264.50-55,
T1272.50</i>; see affidavit of Lee made 20 April 1999 para 24).
<P>

337   	On 18 February 1999 the defendant served consolidated
particulars of truth adding particulars in relation to D16 to D23.
 (See
affidavit of R.W. Potter made 12 March 1999 para 12).
<P>

338   	On 24 February 1999 the plaintiff filed a notice of
motion to set aside the defendant's subpoena.  The motion was filed in
Court
before Hulme J. who adjourned the hearing of the motion.
<P>

339   	On 26 February 1999 the defendant served further
particulars of truth adding particulars relating to D24 and D25.  (See
affidavit
of R.W. Potter made 12 March 1999 para 13).
<P>

340   	On 2 March 1999 the plaintiff's Counsel suggested that
the notice of motion to set aside the subpoena be stood over generally.
 (See
affidavit of Gillingham made 17 March 1999 para 28 and p 124).
<P>

341   	Between 3 March 1999 and 9 March 1999 the Court heard
evidence and submissions on the plaintiff's application to deny the
defendant
access to some of the material produced on the subpoena on the grounds of
client legal privilege and public interest immunity
and the general discretion
contained in <b><i>National Employers' Mutual General Association Limited v
Waind </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 372.</a>
<P>

342   	On 9 March 1999 the Crown Solicitor attended the Court to
produce two further files of material in answer to the subpoena.
 I granted the
plaintiff first access for 24 hours.  (See affidavit of Gillingham made 17
March 1999 para 24).
<P>

343   	On 9 March 1999 Gillingham inspected the material
produced on 9 March 1999 and claimed privilege and confidentiality over
all of
the material and arranged for all material to be photocopied.  (See affidavit
of Gillingham made on 17 March 1999 para 25).
 This claim had not yet been
determined.
<P>

344   	On 12 March 1999 the plaintiff filed a new notice of
motion to set aside the subpoena.  (See affidavit of Gillingham made

<P>

<b>Evidence of Woodhouse (Defendant's Submissions)</b>
<P>

345   	In his affidavit of 14 April 1999 (paragraph 5) Woodhouse
said he did not have a conversation with any person about the form
of the
defendant's subpoena prior to receiving a copy of it, which he did on or about
18 January 1999.  Woodhouse said that paragraph
C of the defendant's subpoena
related specifically to the investigations being carried by Strike Force Cori.
He gave instructions
at the meeting on 20 January 1999 to Singleton about this
paragraph and paragraphs A15 and A16.  The remaining paragraphs of the
subpoena
related to Superintendent  Inkster's inquiry.
<P>

346   	At the meeting on 20 January 1999 Woodhouse informed
Singleton that his investigation was ongoing and he was not prepared
to produce
any material that may be included in a report to the D.P.P.  However, he said
to Singleton that he had no objection to
the production of a number of
documents falling within the defendant's subpoena which related to allegations
which he was no longer
investigating (para 9) and which he had decided would
not be included in a report to the D.P.P.
<P>

347   	On 25 January 1999 he received a second subpoena from the
plaintiff.  A copy of the subpoena is Annexure "B" to Woodhouse's
affidavit of
14 April 1999.  The subpoena issued by the plaintiff related specifically to
material concerning D15 and D16.  These
were the same documents as were
requested by the defendant in its subpoena.  (Para 14, affidavit of Woodhouse
made 14 April 1999).
<P>

348   	Woodhouse said that when considering the plaintiff's and
the defendant's subpoena, it was obvious to him that both parties
were seeking
substantially the same documents.  Specifically, paragraph C of the defendant's
subpoena sought substantially the same
information as paragraph 29 of the
plaintiff's first subpoena.  Paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 3(a) and 3(b) of the
plaintiff's second subpoena
sought the same documents as  paragraph A15 and A16
of the defendant's subpoena.  This fact and the other matters referred to in
paragraph 80 of his policy log (affidavit of Woodhouse made 14 April 1999
Annexure "D"), caused Woodhouse to reconsider the position
held by him on 20
January 1999 (see paragraph 18).
<P>

349   	Woodhouse also said that after he interviewed the
plaintiff on 29 January 1999 he did not have further significant investigations
to make and therefore believed that public interest had expired once the
allegations were put to the plaintiff (paragraph 19).  The
further information
obtained later from the plaintiff's solicitor (Mr Lee) did not alter
Woodhouse's conclusion that his investigation
had effectively been completed.
(Paragraph 19).
<P>

350   	Woodhouse specifically denied that he disclosed the
documents to the defendant for the purpose of indirectly engineering
a stay of
the civil proceedings or that he wished to use the civil proceedings as some
sort of committal proceedings (see paragraph
27 to the affidavit of Woodhouse
made on 14 April 1999).
<P>

<b>Oral evidence of Woodhouse (Defendant's Submissions)</b>
<P>

351   	Woodhouse said that by March 1999 there was no ongoing
investigation (<i>T966.50-55</i>) and that with the record of interview with
Marsden on 29 January 1999 the public interest immunity claim was no longer
available.
 He said that he regarded a subpoena from a Court as a legitimate
order and a legitimate direction to him (<i>T967.5-50).</i>
<P>

352   	At (<i>T974.55</i>), Woodhouse made it clear that Quail
did not get the "<i>list of 12 names</i>" from him.  Woodhouse said he was not
expecting the subpoena of 18 January 1999 (see <i>T979.25-30</i>).  He also
said that Quail did not tell him about the subpoena and that Quail never asked
him about the names (<i>T979.25-35</i>).  Woodhouse denied giving Quail the
list of names (<i>T980.35</i>).  Woodhouse said that at no stage prior to 18
January 1999 did he tell Quail he could not produce the names without a
subpoena (<i>T980.30</i>).
<P>

353   	At (<i>T983.55</i>), Woodhouse said he accepted a
decision of the Solicitor General that there would be no stay of the civil
proceedings and accepted
that it was a <i>fait accompli</i> that the civil
proceedings would go ahead.  Woodhouse denied that he knew that by producing
the statements this would lead to further
particulars being supplied by the
defence and a likelihood of there being an adjournment (<i>T984.1-5</i>).
Woodhouse also denied that he sought to procure an adjournment by supplying the
further statements (<i>T984.5</i>).
<P>

354   	Woodhouse said he did not turn his mind to whether or not
the Police could evaluate the evidence given by the complainants
if the civil
proceedings went on with the new particulars (<i>T984.20</i>).
<P>

355   	At the time when Woodhouse agreed to deliver the
documents in response to the subpoena he considered that public interest
immunity had expired (<i>T970.50</i>).  Woodhouse considered that the
investigations of Strike Force Cori had been completed with the interview of
the plaintiff on 29
January 1999 (<i>T982.20</i> and <i>T983.5-10</i>).  
<P>

356   	Woodhouse regarded the documents as caught by the
subpoena issued by both parties.  Operating on his mind at the time when
he
produced the documents was that both parties to the proceedings were wanting
precisely the same documents (<i>T981.20-25</i>).  Woodhouse regarded the
documents as caught by subpoena and in relation to those produced not covered
by a claim for public interest
immunity because the investigation being
conducted by him had come to end when the allegations had been put to the
plaintiff (<i>T983.5-10</i>).
<P>

357   	Woodhouse said he did not know that if he produced
"<i>new statements</i>" this would lead to further particulars of the defence
which would be likely to cause an adjournment (<i>T984.1-5</i>).  Woodhouse
specifically denied that he sought to cause an adjournment to the civil
proceedings by producing the statements (<i>T984.5-10</i>).  He rejected the
suggestion that after failing to obtain an adjournment of the civil
proceedings, production of the statements
might enable the Police to evaluate
the evidence in this case as it proceeded (<i>T984.10-15</i>).  He specifically
denied that he wanted an adjournment or stay of the civil proceedings
(<i>T984.15-20</i>) once the Solicitor General had rejected his request put in
the letter of 22 December 1998 (Exhibit 11, tab 22).  Woodhouse specifically
denied that it was his purpose in producing the documents to cause a situation
where the plaintiff would require an adjournment in
order to investigate the
fresh allegations and deal with them (<i>T992.10</i>). 
<P>

<b>Oral evidence of Angus (Defendant's Submissions)</b>
<P>

358   	Mr Angus:
<P>

(a)	denied he had any discussions with Woodhouse prior to the issue of the
subpoena (<i>T514.10</i>) or with any police officer about its form
(<i>T552.5</i>);
<P>

(b)	said that he was unaware of the existence of any of the people named in
paragraph 19 of his affidavit made on 18 February 1999
until 5 February 1999
(<i>T514.40, T515.5</i>);
<P>

(c)	said that he did not know what stage the Police investigation had reached
when he issued the subpoena on 18 January 1999 (<i>T515.10</i>);
<P>

(d)	said that it was not until early January that he gave consideration to the
issue of a subpoena to the Police (<i>T518.55</i>).  
<P>

359   	He denied that he issued the subpoena to obtain material
which he hoped might emerge in order that he might use it to damage
the
plaintiff (<i>T515.15</i>).  Angus stated that his intention in issuing the
subpoena was to obtain material which the defendant might use at the trial by
way
of corroboration of the material the defendant had and to obtain material
to test the plaintiff in cross-examination (<i>T19.25-30</i>).  He thought it
was strongly probable the Police had information relating to purposes
identified in the paragraph above <i>(T515.35). </i>He denied he issued the
subpoena to cause great delay <i>(T520.30). </i>He denied he issued the
subpoena in order to force an adjournment (<i>T520.30-35).</i>  
<P>

360   	Angus said that the production of statements of D17 to
D25 was a surprise (<i>T520.40</i>). He had the opinion that the subpoena would
stand up (<i>T526.50</i>).  Mr Angus summarised the effect of the discussion
held at the meeting with the Crown Solicitor to be that, in the view of Mr
Singleton,
the subpoena could be challenged and he indicated that a limited
call of subpoena was possible and that if the defendant accepted
the limited
call there would not be an application to set aside the subpoena
(<i>T526.1-5</i>). He denied that the subpoena was a fishing expedition
(<i>T528.10-15</i>) and denied that the subpoena was an abuse of process
(<i>T528.15</i>).
<P>

361   	At (<i>T528.40-45</i>), he stated that when he agreed to
narrow the call on the subpoena he did not know the statements of D17-D25 were
going to be produced.
 He also denied he was looking for material upon which he
could base further particulars of justification (<i>T528.45-50</i>).  Mr Angus
said that he did not tell Singleton he was looking for other witnesses and that
he did not say to Singleton what his
purpose was in issuing the subpoena.  He
did not tell Singleton that the defendant was looking for material with which
to attack
the plaintiff's credit (<i>T531.25</i>). He did not tell Singleton
that the defendant was looking for material to make new allegations
(<i>T531.30).  </i>At (<i>T534</i>), he denied that the subpoena was nothing
more than a fishing expedition on his part and his client's part ((20-25)); he
also denied
that he knew at the time when he issued the subpoena it had the
potential to interrupt the proceedings by causing extensive delay
(<i>T534.35).
</i>At (<i>T535</i>), Mr Angus explained why he left it until 18 January 1999
to issue the subpoena, see paragraph 125 hereof. 
<P>

362   	He denied that the arrangement with the Crown Solicitor
was improper;  that he did not want the meeting of 21 January 1999
disclosed;
and that he omitted reference to the meeting of 21 January 1999 in his
affidavit made 13 April 1999 because he did not
want the "<i>improper deal</i>"
with the Crown Solicitor disclosed. He said that the reason that the meeting of
21 January 1999 was not referred to in his affidavit
of 13 April 1999 was
because he regarded the meeting as privileged (<i>T830.20-25</i>).  Mr Angus
denied that there was any deliberate concealment of the meeting of 21 January
1999 at (<i>T835.45-50 </i>and <i>T836.10</i>).  He said that the usual
situation is not to involve other parties to the proceedings when discussing
with the person subpoenaed
that person's response to the subpoena
(<i>T836.30)</i>.
<P>

363   	Mr Angus expressed the professional opinion that the
subpoena would have survived an application to have it set aside as
an abuse
process.  He expressed the opinion that the subpoena was not so wide as to
amount to an abuse of process (<i>T844)</i>.  At (<i>T847.45-50)</i> hr denied
he was just looking for "<i>dirt to throw at the Mr Marsden</i>."  He said he
was looking for matters to cross-examine him about as to his credit.
<P>

364   	At (<i>T849.20-30)</i> Mr Angus denied that he had any
knowledge of any documents which would have involved new complainants and that
he had any idea at
all that the Police had such documents when he issued the
subpoena.  He said he did not recall turning his mind to the possibility
of new
complainants (<i>T849.40)</i>.  Mr Angus denied that he knew it was likely in
the nature of things that Strike Force Cori was investigating new allegations
and
that is why he issued the subpoena (<i>T854.40)</i>.
<P>

365   	At <i>T854.55 </i>he said he hoped by the subpoena to
obtain documents which  related to D13 - D16 in order to support the new
particulars in relation
to D13, D15 and D16 (<i>T855.5).</i>
<P>

366   	At <i>T855.55 </i>he said that the information concerning
the 12 new complainants was totally unexpected and at (<i>T855-856.1)</i> that
he "<i>did not have a clue" </i>when he issued the subpoena that he was likely
to obtain the names of 12 new complainants.
<P>

367   	Mr Angus denied that the reason why he delayed in issuing
the subpoena was so the proceedings would be delayed (<i>T857.1-10</i>).  He
Angus denied that he knew that the conduct of the Police giving various
statements of  new complainants to the defendant in
response to the subpoena
was a gross breach of confidence on the part of the Police (<i>T863)</i>.  He
denied that he accepted the Crown Solicitor's offer in relation to the response
to the subpoena on the condition that the Police
produce ten statements
(<i>T878.10)</i>.
<P>

368   	Mr Angus said his understanding of the agreement was that
the defendant would receive information which was documentation
not the subject
of current Police investigations and which was not subject to public interest
immunity (<i>T880.40.45)</i>. He understood the expression "<i>off the
record</i>" as it applied to the meeting held on 21 January 1999 to mean
"<i>without prejudice</i>" (<i>T925.5-10)</i>.  
<P>

369   	In practice as a litigation solicitor for 25 years, Mr
Angus said he had never been informed by an opposing party of a proposal
to
have a discussion with the respondent of a subpoena in relation to compliance
with a subpoena (<i>T925.10-15)</i>. In his professional experience, there was
no professional obligation to inform an opposing party of a proposal to have a
discussion
with the respondent of a subpoena as to compliance
(<i>T925.40-50).</i>
<P>

370   	At the conclusion of the meeting on 21 January 1999
attended by himself, Barnett,  Singleton and Tomlin it was his understanding
that the Police would produce documents which felt within paragraphs B and C of
the subpoena and also paragraphs D and E subject
to any claim for public
interest immunity (<i>T928.5-10)</i>.
<P>

371   	At (<i>T928-929.55</i>), he said that the existence of
the "<i>list of 12</i>" or the information in it played no part in the
formulation of the particulars the subject of the amended application.
<P>

<b>Oral evidence of Barnett (Defendant's Submissions)</b>
<P>

372   	In her evidence at (<i>T994.10-25</i>) she said that her
understanding of the meeting on 21 January 1999 was that it would be
confidential and not be disclosed to Phillips
Fox (<i>T994.20</i>).  She was
asked whether she thought the situation was a "<i>bit odd</i>" and she said
"<i>no</i>".
<P>

373   	At (<i>T994</i>), she said Singleton was anxious not to
appear partial and that it was her understanding that the meeting was protected
by legal
professional privilege.
<P>

374   	At (<i>T995.20</i>), it was suggested to she that the
whole reason for the defendant being interested in accepting the Crown
Solicitor's offer partially
to comply with the subpoena was to obtain the
"<i>twelve new complainants</i>." She denied that this was the whole reason for
the defendant accepting the offer.  At (<i>T995.40</i>), she said that the
offer was made to comply partially with the subpoena before there was reference
to the new complainants and at
(<i>T996.10-15</i>), she denied that the object
of the subpoena was to try and obtain information for the purpose of drawing
new particulars of truth.
<P>

375   	At (<i>T996</i>), following questions and answers are
recorded:
<P>

<i>"Q:	Did you know the stage at which this case had reached when the subpoena
was issued?</i>
<P>

<i>A:	Yes, I was I had been involved with the case from January.</i>
<P>

<i>Q:	And the object of the subpoena, was it not, was to try and obtain
information for the purpose of drawing new particulars of truth?</i>
<P>

<i>A:	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q:	That's what it was all about, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A:	No".</i>
<P>

376   	Ms Barnett denied that the defendant retained the right
to withdraw from the settlement if there were less names provided
than ten
(<i>T998.10-15</i>).
<P>

<b>General submissions For the Defendant </b>
<P>

377   	The discussion that occurred on 21 January 1999 between
Angus and Singleton and others, to determine the extent to which
the Police
would respond to the subpoena, was consistent with usual practice.  In
particular the "<i>agreement</i>" between Singleton and  Angus that the
discussions concerning the Police response to the subpoena not be disclosed to
the plaintiff's
solicitors, was consistent with usual practice.
<P>

378   	The usual practice is that parties do not disclose to
their opponents the content of discussions with strangers to whom subpoena
have
been directed for the production of documents.
<P>

379   	That the discussions between Angus and  Singleton were
consistent with each aspect of the usual practice, namely limited
calls on
subpoena and non-disclosure of discussions to other parties to the litigation,
is available from the evidence of:  Angus
(<i>T925.20-45; T924.5 </i>and
<i>T925.15</i>);  Gillingham (<i>T1090A, T1102.15-20</i> and
<i>T1102.20-25</i>);  Potter (<i>T1158</i> and <i>T1161A</i> (not disclosing
discussions with the other side);  Potter (<i>T1157-1158</i>) (limited
compliance).
<P>

380   	In relation to limited compliance and non disclosure,
account can be taken of my decision of 12 February 1999 (DLJT8);  Exhibit
Q,
letter dated 23 October 1998 from Phillips Fox to Mallesons Stephen Jaques
declining to provide information regarding the schedules
to subpoena issued by
the plaintiff.  The refusal to disclose the terms of subpoena to strangers is
consistent with usual practice.
 
<P>

381   	Those Documents which were produced by the Proper Officer
of the NSW Police were within the terms of the subpoena and were
not subject to
any public interest immunity claim.
<P>

382   	Each of Angus and Woodhouse denied that there was any
ulterior or collateral purpose in issuing and complying with the subpoena.
 Ms
Barnett expressly denied that the defendant's purpose in issuing the subpoena
was to obtain material which could be used as further
particulars of
justification.  She was not challenged on this answer.
<P>

383   	The documents sought by the subpoena (particularly those
paragraphs with which the Police agreed to respond by the production
of
documents, namely, see B, C, D and E) had an apparent relevance to the issues
in the proceedings as they existed at 18 January
1999, ie prior to the
amendment of the imputations).
<P>

384   	The documents had an apparent relevance to the following
issues:  the falsity of the imputations and contextual imputations
(as existing
at 18 January 1999); the cross-examination of the plaintiff in relation to
credit and his denials;  the propensity of
the plaintiff to engage in the
conduct alleged;  the question of whether or not the plaintiff visited
Costellos and other premises
used for juvenile male prostitution; the
justification particulars delivered by correspondence dated 6, 7 and 14 January
1999.  (These
particulars involve D13, D14, D15 and D16).
<P>

385   	The point is sufficiently made by reference to the above.
Written submissions for the defendant expand the relevance issue
to a variety
of other matters including the defendant's proposed case on qualified
privilege.  During oral submissions I was loath
to allow more than reference to
the existence of such other areas.  The focus is on the relevance to the
matters the subject of the
amendment application.
<P>

386   	As to proof of an abuse of process, it was submitted that
a person alleging an abuse of process must show that the predominant
purpose of
the other party in using the legal process has been other than that for which
it was designed.
<P>

387   	The onus of satisfying the Court that there is an abuse
of process lies upon the party alleging it.  It is a "<i>heavy one</i>".
(<b><i>Williams v Spautz</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d1992%29%20174%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-1992) 174 CLR 509</a> at p 529; "...<i>to a
very high level of satisfaction"</i> (per Levine J, DLJT36, para 4).  Clear and
sufficient evidence is required (<b><i>Goldsmith v Sperrings</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20WLR%20478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1
WLR 478</a> at 498-499).
<P>

388   	Proceedings are brought for an improper purpose, and thus
constitute an abuse of process, where the purpose of bringing them
is not to
prosecute them to a conclusion but to use them as a means of obtaining some
advantage for which they are not designed or
some collateral advantage beyond
what the law offers (<b><i>Williams v Spautz</i></b> (<i>supra</i>) p 526).
<P>

389   	In this case, the evidence negates a finding that the
subpoena was issued to effect an object not within the scope of the
process or
was issued for some extraneous or ulterior purpose.  To the contrary, the
evidence establishes that the subpoena was legitimate
in form and was issued
for its proper purpose.
<P>

390   	As to the submissions for the plaintiff that the subpoena
was "<i>fishing</i>", junior counsel for the defendant, Mr Wheelhouse, assisted
the Court with extensive oral and written submissions to which I hope
to do
justice in my rehearsing of them as follows:
<P>

391   	A subpoena can be set aside if its terms are too wide.
This may occur where the subpoena does not refer to specific documents:<b><i>
Lee v Argas</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281866%29%20LR%202%20Eq%2059" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1866) LR 2 Eq 59.</a> However if a person to whom a subpoena
is directed admits to having in his possession documents covered by the terms
of the subpoena
he must produce them: <b><i>Lee v Argas</i></b>. This is the
why the usual practice is to hold all discussions concerning compliance with a
subpoena on a "<i>without prejudice basis</i>": see <b><i>TPC v Arnotts
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/248.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 248</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2088%20ALR%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 88 ALR 90.</a>
<P>

392   	If the proper officer of the NSW Police Service had
objected to the subpoena on the basis that it was oppressive and amounted
to
fishing it would have been open to the defendant to ask the proper officer on
the return date of the subpoena to state whether
the Police were in the
possession of documents which they understood were caught by the terms of the
subpoena.  As is apparent from
the documents ultimately produced by the Police,
the Proper Officer would have had to have admitted that there were documents in
the possession of the Police Service which could have been produced in response
to the subpoena: see <b><i>O'Born v Commissioner for Government
Transport</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%2077%20WN%20%28NSW%29%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 77 WN (NSW) 81</a> at 83; <b><i>TPC v Arnotts</i></b> at
103.
<P>

393   	In <b><i>TPC v Arnotts </i></b>Beaumont J. said at 102-3
:
<P>

<i>"It is also material to look at the impact of the subpoena upon [the party
on whom the subpoena is served].  . . . it is convenient
to address the present
application . . by reference to two questions:</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	Does the material sought have an apparent relevance to the issues in the
principal proceedings, ie, is adjectival, as distinct
from substantive,
relevance established? Does the subpoena have a legitimate forensic purpose to
this extent? This involves a consideration
of the matter from the standpoint of
[the party issuing the subpoena].</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	Is the subpoena seriously and unfairly burdensome or prejudicial? This
is to look at the matter from the point of view of [the
party on whom the
subpoena is served]."</i>
<P>

394   	As to the first of these factors, his Honour said at 103
that the test of adjectival relevance is satisfied if the material
has apparent
relevance. As the material sought "could possibly throw light on the issues in
the main case" then adjectival relevance
was established. 
<P>

395   	And, as Cantor J. said in <b><i>R v Barton </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981]
2 NSWLR 414</a> at 420:  <i>"in considering the type of documents and how they bear
upon an issue in the litigation the court will act realistically and not
require
the production of documents which only would have a bearing upon an
issue on an unreal, fanciful or speculative basis."</i>
<P>

396   	Further, Moffitt P. referred in <b><i>Waind v Hill
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 372</a> at 385 to documents having "<i>apparent
relevance</i>" to the issues in the following terms:  "<i>the limitation on the
exercise of the judge's discretion to allow inspection is that the document
contains information of apparent
relevance to the issues, Once the judge has
that opinion, inspection will normally be allowed, notwithstanding that the
document
 is not admissible as it stands, and notwithstanding that the party
seeking inspection has not given any undertaking to tender it,
or use it cross
examination". </i>
<P>

397   	The Police Service produced documents relating to
paragraphs B, C, D and E of the subpoena. 
<P>

398   	Paragraph B dealt with Inkster's investigations into
allegations that the plaintiff had committed criminal offences by engaging
in
sexual intercourse with young male prostitutes who were under the age of 18.
Clearly, that material is relevant, substantively
and adjectivally, to the
issues pleaded. A request for that material cannot amount to
"<i>fishing</i>".
<P>

399   	Paragraph C dealt with Woodhouse's investigations. Again,
given the pleadings, the material sought is clearly relevant and
a request to
produce it cannot amount to "<i>fishing</i>".
<P>

400   	Paragraph D dealt with records of investigations carried
out in relation to conflicting statements made by D3. D3 has been
part of the
justification case since the filing of the original defence and material
relating to statements made by him concerning
the plaintiff is of clear
relevance. 
<P>

401   	Paragraph E deals with records of investigations in
relation to conflicting statements of Colin John Fisk. Fisk is referred
to in
the matter complained of, and part of the Defendant's case on qualified
privilege is the use the defendant made of the Fisk
material.
<P>

402   	As to the second of these factors, the fact of the matter
is that the documents sought were produced. The Police Service
did not seek to
argue that compliance was in any way seriously and unfairly burdensome or
prejudicial. On the contrary, the documents
were produced to the Court. 
<P>

403   	Where a witness to whom a subpoena to produce documents
is issued seeks to have the subpoena struck out as being oppressive
in failing
to indicate with sufficient particularity the documents sought the fundamental
consideration is whether, in all the circumstances
including the identity and
situation of the recipient, the class of documents is sufficiently identified:
<b><i>R v Barton </i></b>at 428; <b><i>Lucas Industries Ltd v Hewitt
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2045%20FLR%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 45 FLR 174</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=18%20ALR%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">18 ALR 555.</a>  The defendant submits that not only has
it satisfied these requirements, but as the Police Service, the party on whom
the subpoena
was served, did not move to set aside the subpoena on any ground
of oppression, including fishing, the subpoena cannot be set aside.
<P>

404   	The plaintiff's submissions must be seen in the context
of the subpoena issued by him on 13 October 1998.  The description
of the class
of documents referred to in paragraphs B and C of the subpoena is in almost
identical terms as the subpoena issued by
the plaintiff on 13 October 1998
which is Annexure H to the affidavit of Michael Woodhouse made 2 March 1999.

<P>

405   	Paragraphs 29, 30 and 31 of the plaintiff's subpoena are
in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"John Marsden</i>
<P>

<i>29.	All records, files, documents, correspondence, memoranda, statements,
statutory declaration, records of interview, filenotes,
computer print-outs,
computer disks, audio-tapes and video tapes in relation to John Marsden of 225
Denham Court Road, Ingleburn,
New South Wales from 1 January 1994 to
date.</i>
<P>

<i>Inkster Inquiry</i>
<P>

<i>30.	All records, files, documents, correspondence, memoranda, statements,
statutory declaration, records of interview, filenotes,
computer print-outs,
computer disks, audio-tapes and video tapes obtained in the course of
investigations in relation to John Robert
Marsden headed by Detective Inspector
Inkster from about January 1994 to December 1997.</i>
<P>

<i>31.	All records, files, documents, correspondence, memoranda, statements,
statutory declaration, records of interview, filenotes,
computer print-outs,
computer disks, audio-tapes and video tapes in relation to "Costellos."</i>
<P>

406   	By drawing the subpoena in the above terms the plaintiff
must have come to the conclusions that the class of documents was
properly and
adequately described, and the documents sought had an "<i>apparent</i>"
relevance to the issues in the proceedings.  
<P>

407   	These conclusions of the plaintiff coincide with those of
the defendant when it issued the subpoena.
<P>

408   	The concept of "<i>fishing</i>" in the context of
discovery was explained by Lord Esher MR in <b><i>Hennessy v Wright (No 2)
</i></b>at 448:  <i>"The plaintiff wishes to maintain his questions, and to
insist upon answers to them, in order that he may find out something of which
he knows nothing now, which might enable him to make a case of which he has no
knowledge at present.  If that is the effect of the
interrogatories, it seems
to me that they come within the description of "fishing" interrogatories, and
on that ground cannot be
allowed."</i>
<P>

409   	"<i>Fishing</i>" in the context of a subpoena must be a
wider concept because a subpoena can properly be issued to obtain material for
cross-examination
on credit, which material may be beyond the ambit of
discovery.
<P>

410   	Again, in relation to discovery, the concept of "fishing"
was explained by Lindgren J in <b><i>TPC v CC (NSW) Pty Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%2058%20FLR%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 58
FLR 426</a> at 437 F - 439.  Lindgren J. said:  <i>"It remains to consider the
submission that discovery should not be ordered because the Commission seeks to
use it as a "fishing expedition."
 It has often been said to be a ground on
which discovery (and interrogatories) will not be ordered, that the purpose is
to carry
out a "fishing expedition": see, for example, Hennessy v Wright (No 2)
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2024%20QBD%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 24 QBD 445n</a> at 448n ... What does the reference to a "fishing
expedition" mean?  After all, Exhibit hypothesi, the giving of discovery will
often,
if not always, reveal documents of which the other party was not
previously aware (similarly, the administering of interrogatories
will often,
if not always, reveal information of which the other party was not previously
aware).  What is meant is that discovery
must not be used for the purpose of
ascertaining whether a case exists, as distinct from the purpose of compelling
the production
of documents where there is already some evidence that a case
exists: see, for example, Commissioner for Railways v Small <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1938/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] NSWStRp 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2038%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 38 SR (NSW)
564</a> at 575 ...  what is required is that "sufficient is shown to ground a
suspicion that the party applying for discovery has a good
case proof of which
is likely to be aided by discovery."  On the facts of particular cases, the
application of the distinction between
"fishing" and "non-fishing" may well be
difficult."  </i>
<P>

411   	At the time when the subpoena was issued the defendant
was aware or suspected: 
<P>

(a)	That Detective Inspector Inkster had carried out an investigation into the
plaintiff in relation to allegations that the plaintiff
engaged in sexual
activities with boys under the age of 18.  This is apparent from the terms of
paragraph 30 of the plaintiff's subpoena
which was the subject of a contested
hearing before Ireland J.
<P>

(b)	That the Police were in possession of documents of the kind referred to in
paragraph 29 of the plaintiff's subpoena (this is
apparent from the terms of
paragraph 29 of the plaintiff's subpoena).
<P>

(c)	That the Police were in possession of documents concerning ongoing
investigations in relation to the plaintiff generated by
Superintendent
Woodhouse because:  (i) Woodhouse had requested Mr Quail to assist him in
relation allegations made by D14 concerning
D13; see p. 945 (15-45) Exhibit 11
Tab 5, Police Log 93/20/2 and Tab 15 Police Log 93/20/4;  (ii) Woodhouse wrote
directly to the
defendant's solicitors on 8 December 1998 concerning D15 and
D16; see Exhibit 11 Tab 15 letter dated 8 December 1998 from the NSW
Police
Service, Child Protection Agency to Mr Ian Angus, Mallesons Stephen Jaques.
This letter states D15 and D16 are "<i>potential witnesses in a current
criminal investigation.  The letter is signed by "Michael Woodhouse Commander
Strike Force Cori</i>."
<P>

(d)	By 18 January 1999 the defendant had interviewed D13 and D15, in relation
to himself and D16, and had provided further particulars
of justification based
on the interviews.
<P>

412   	Further because of the defendant's knowledge of the
allegations made by D13 and D15 it reasonably suspected that Superintendent
Woodhouse, was in possession of material relating to:
<P>

(i)	the principal allegations in the proceedings; and
<P>

(ii)	that may have been important for the cross-examination of the
plaintiff.
<P>

413   	Moreover, the defences of justification were first
pleaded on 26 September 1995 and 14 August 1996.  In this sense, the
defendant's
case already "<i>existed</i>".
<P>

414   	The fact that the material produced went beyond that
which the defendant anticipated is irrelevant as to whether the subpoena
amounted to "fishing" or was an "<i>abuse of process.</i>"
<P>

415   	Further, the fact that the terms of the subpoena do not
precisely correspond with the particulars of justification does not
establish
that the subpoena is "<i>fishing</i>."  As with discovery a party is not
confined in his or her quest for documents to the particulars supplied.  In
<b><i>TPC v CC (NSW) Pty Ltd </i></b>(<i>supra</i>).  Lindgren J. specifically
rejected a submission similar to that of the plaintiff at 439 F where his
Honour said:
<P>

<i>"The respondents submit that the Commission should be directed to "supply
particulars by putting on its affidavit evidence" before
the discovery issue is
decided.  I do not agree.  A well-accepted situation which the court often
exercises its discretion by ordering
discovery before particulars are supplied
is that in which the party which seeks particulars and resists discovery is
alone in possession
of the relevant documents... </i>
<P>

<i>In <b>Esso v FCT </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/1655.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 1655</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20159%20ALR%20664" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 159 ALR 664</a> at 701 (45-50) and 702 Merkel J.
said that the well established rule is that discoverable documents which relate
to any matter in
question between the parties are not limited to documents
which would be evidence to prove or disprove and matter in question in
the
action (p. 701) and that access is given on discovery for a broader
investigative purpose.</i>
<P>

416   	The defendant also submitted that the difficulty posed by
the Plaintiff's application is that it is almost hypothetical.
 The defendant
is in the position where it is expected to demonstrate how it would have
responded if the Police or the plaintiff
(if he was entitled to) had moved to
set aside the subpoena prior to 4 February 1999 before the Police commenced to
comply with the
obligations imposed on them by the subpoena.  The Court cannot
reasonably expect the defendant to prove by evidence how it would
have met an
application to set aside the subpoena if it had been made at the appropriate
time in the usual way.  This is particularly
so in relation to those documents
which the defendant was seeking for the purpose of cross examining the
plaintiff and corroborating
the evidence of its witnesses.  If an attack had
been made on the subpoena at the appropriate time by the Police or the
plaintiff
the defendant could have made a properly informed decision on whether
to tender evidence to demonstrate forensic purpose and apparent
relevance.
<P>

417   	Is it legitimate for a party to narrow a call on the
class of documents caught by the terms of a subpoena? (defendant's
submission).
<P>

418   	As a matter of practical common sense it is open to a
stranger to inquire of a party whether that party will regard the stranger's
obligations under a subpoena satisfied by production of certain specified
documents, and for the party to inform the stranger that
it will accept the
production offered as satisfaction of the obligations imposed by their
subpoena.  This cannot be characterised
as "<i>redrafting</i>" the subpoena or
altering the stranger's obligations under the subpoena. 
<P>

419   	Prior to a subpoena being called in court, it would be
appropriate for a party to advise a stranger that it was not intending
to call
various paragraphs of a subpoena so as not to cause to the stranger unnecessary
cost and expense.  To suggest, as did the
Plaintiff's counsel, that once a
subpoena is issued there are only two options open a stranger, namely:  produce
all documents covered
by the subpoena; or set aside the subpoena, is to suggest
an extreme position which would make the subpoena process unworkable.
<P>

420   	It is well recognised that the court cannot investigate
every on-contentious compliance with orders for discovery and production
of
documents under subpoena.  An example of the appropriate way to deal with a
wide subpoena is found in the decision of Ireland
J., on 24 December 1998 in
this case, dealing with the Plaintiff's subpoena to the Police.
<P>

421   	In relation to paragraph 31 of the Plaintiff's subpoena
(a copy of which is annexure H to the affidavit of Michael Woodhouse
made 2
March 1999), the his Honour said:  "<i>Paragraph 31 is in the following terms:
All records, files, documents, correspondence, memoranda, statements, statutory
declarations,
records of interview, file notes, computer printouts, computer
disks, audio tapes and video tapes in relation to "Costellos".  The
call has
been restricted so as to be confined to such material as is known to Detective
Inkster and the group or body known as the
Child Protection Agency. Thus
confined, it is common ground that the subpoena is not oppressive, the material
in question having
already been gathered together."</i>
<P>

422   	What occurred before Justice Ireland is precisely the
same as the arrangement made between the defendant and the Police,
namely, the
issuing party agreed that the stranger's obligations under the subpoena would
be satisfied by production of a class of
documents identified by the stranger.
In that case the class of documents was defined by Inkster's knowledge; and
Costellos.
<P>

423   	This is precisely the same method of defining the class
of documents to be produced was agreed between the defendant and
the Police in
relation to the Defendant's subpoena of 18 January 1999.
<P>

424   	Critical to the question of whether or not the subpoena
was oppressive was whether or not the organisation subpoenaed had
the capacity
to gather together the material caught by the subpoena.  Large organisations
such as the Police force or banks or the
Commonwealth of Australia have
significant resources and thus what may be oppressive for an individual may not
be oppressive for
those types of institutions.  That is why Ireland J. said
"<i>the subpoena is not oppressive, the material in question having already
been gathered together".</i>
<P>

425   	In the restricted form the subpoena was held to have a
"<i>legitimate forensic purpose</i>".  The basis of the submission in relation
to legitimate forensic purpose was that interests of justice are best served by
all evidence
on issues in the litigation being available to the Court: see page
4 of the judgment.  (See also <b><i>Marcel</i></b> at 258E;  my judgment (DLJT:
8)<i> </i>of 12 February 1999 and Sheppard J in<b><i> Bank of NSW v
Withers</i></b> (1981) 35 ALR 21 at 40-42).
<P>

426   	In other words it is inappropriate for a court in
relation to material produced on subpoena to require parties (confronted
with
an application to set aside a subpoena) to tender evidence as to the precise
basis or precise forensic purpose for which the
material sought by the subpoena
is to be used.  This is especially so when the application is made by an
opposing party.  This is
undoubtedly one of the reasons why courts do not
generally regard a party as having standing to set aside a subpoena issued to a
stranger by an opposing party.
<P>

427   	In a practical sense it would make the administration of
justice impossible if parties had standing as of right to challenge
subpoena by
opposing parties; and each party had to establish by evidence by reason of an
application made by another party (and
not the stranger to whom the subpoena
was issued) the precise forensic purpose for which the document was sought
under the subpoena.
<P>

428   	If the court allowed this process it would unduly
interfere with the trial process.
<P>

429   	In <b><i>Waind v Hill</i> </b>Moffitt P at 381E outlined
the three steps involved in the procedure in having a third party bringing
documents to the Court and in
the subsequent use of those documents.  The first
is obeying the subpoena, by the witness bringing the documents to the Court and
handing them to the Judge.  The second step is the decision of the Judge
concerning the preliminary uses of the documents, including
whether or not
inspection should be permitted.  The third step in the admission into evidence
of the document in whole or in part,
or the use of it in the process of
evidence being put before the Court by cross-examination or otherwise.  Moffitt
P. concludes "<i>in these three steps the strangers and their parties have
different rights, and the function of the judge differs</i>." 
<P>

430   	It is to be noted that in the above analysis his Honour
does not suggest that a discussion as to compliance with the subpoena
between
the third party and the party issuing it is in any way illegitimate.  What his
Honour says is that it is oppressive to place
upon a stranger an obligation to
form a judgment as to what is relevant to the issue joined in a proceeding to
which he is not a
party, and it would be an abuse of the use of a subpoena to
impose that obligation; see 382B.  That is why it follows that it is
an abuse
to use any subpoena, even to a party, to obtain discovery (see
<b><i>Small's</i></b><i> </i>case) and that a subpoena can only properly be
used for the documents described in particular or general terms which does not
involve
the making of such a judgment.  
<P>

431   	The Plaintiff's submitted in relation to "<i>fishing</i>"
and SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p37" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 37</a> r 11 to the effect that a party and a stranger do not have the
power to "<i>rewrite the whole subpoena</i>"; the agreement operated to read
down every paragraph so that the subpoena applied only to documents known to
Inkster and Woodhouse
is most "<i>iniquitous</i>" because it gave to the Police
a <i>carte blanche</i> and that there was no basis by which defendant could
relieve the Police from compliance because the subpoena was tantamount to a
writ, and that the Police acted wrongly by not telling the plaintiff that they
proposed to produce documents under the subpoena as
read down.  These
propositions have to be seen in the context of the plaintiff having carried out
the precise same activity in relation
to its subpoena.  The submissions are
inappropriate, and ignore usual practice as demonstrated by the Plaintiff's
legal advisers
in relation to the subpoena issued by the plaintiff.
<P>

432   	The Plaintiff's subpoena to the Police was set aside by
Ireland J. on the basis of public interest immunity which the defendant
sensibly opted not to contest.
<P>

<b>Form of subpoena (Defendant's Submissions)</b>
<P>

433   	Even though this application is hypothetical, in the
sense that the subpoena obligations have been discharged and the Court
is now
being asked to consider the validity of the subpoena, the defendant made the
following submissions in relation to the subpoena
as if the application had
taken place.
<P>

434   	The defendant does not press paragraphs A1, A2 and A4.
In relation to paragraph C, the defendant presses the paragraph on
the basis
that it reads "<i>all records etc</i>" - this I allow.  In summary the
Defendant's previous submissions on "<i>fishing</i>" make it clear that a party
is entitled to issue a subpoena as part of a legitimate pre-trial process to
investigate the issues identified
in the litigation or likely to arise.  The
test is not whether the documents are admissible, but whether the documents
have an apparent
or adjectival relevance; if a party reasonably suspects
documents exist which relate to issues in the case identified.  A party which
does not have a case cannot issue a subpoena in the hope that one might be
found.  
<P>

435   	In essence the plaintiff is submitting that the test of
apparent or adjectival relevance is much closer to the test for admissibility
of relevant evidence than courts have recognised is encompassed by the
pre-trial investigative processes.  It is not in the interest
of the
administration of justice that the test for apparent or adjectival relevance is
pushed close to the test for admissibility
of evidence.
<P>

436   	Any discussion as to the form of the subpoena should be
focused on those paragraphs of the subpoena that the defendant actually
pressed, namely B, C, D and E.  I shall not set out the defendant's submissions
as to the balance of the subpoena.  
<P>

437   	As to paragraph B: Detective Inkster investigated the
allegations against Marsden made by Deirdre Grusovin when a member
of the NSW
Parliament.  This is specifically referred to in the Witness program published
on 7 May 1996; see lines 159 to 164 of
the matter complained of.  (This is the
same material as was subpoenaed by the plaintiff.)
<P>

438   	As to paragraph C: see paragraph 411 hereof.
<P>

439   	As to paragraph D: D3 is a crucial witness in the
litigation. It is a notorious fact that D3 has made numerous statements
concerning the plaintiff, one of which was published by the defendant in the
first matter complained of.  The evidence of D3 is specifically
referred to in
the letter dated 22 December 1998 from Woodhouse to Bell which is Annexure G to
the affidavit of Woodhouse of 2 March
1999; see also Exhibit 11.  Annexure H to
the affidavit of Potter made 2 March 1998 makes it clear that the Plaintiff's
relationship
with D3 is a matter currently the subject of a Police
investigation (see paragraph 75).  One of the matters the defendant proposes
to
cross-examine the plaintiff on is the circumstances in which D3 retracted his
statement to the Police.  There also arises the
question of whether the
defendant can have a "<i>declaration of hostility"</i> in relation to D3's
evidence if he is called in chief by the defendant (presumably this is intended
as a reference to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> (NSW)).</i>
<P>

440   	As to paragraph E: Fisk was the subject of discussion in
the <i>Today Tonight </i>program published 13 March 1995, see lines 125 to 154.
The Defendant's presentation of the Fisk material is subject of the Plaintiff's
particulars of malice 3(a)(iii)(2)(g) and 3(c)(4)(xxii)(f).  One of the matters
on which the defendant relies in its defence of qualified
privilege is its
treatment of Fisk.  It proposes to demonstrate the various statements made by
Fisk and how the defendant utilised
the material in a reasonable way in the
matter published.
<P>

441   	In the circumstances, the defendant submits that there is
a more profound reason for the issue of the subpoena and the form
of the
subpoena than to "<i>throw dirt</i>" at the plaintiff.
<P>

442   	Because the subpoena is not "<i>fishing</i>", in the
sense that the defendant had no case and it was searching for material to make
a case, the defendant had a legitimate forensic
purpose in issuing the subpoena
in the form it took.
<P>

443   	It would be quite unreasonable to require the defendant
at this stage of the litigation to justify the "<i>forensic purpose</i>" of the
various classes of documents referred to in the subpoena by tendering evidence
to establish that the documents sought are
admissible to prove an aspect of the
Defendant's case as particularised or to show on what basis the documents were
to be utilised
by the defendant to cross examine the plaintiff and his
witnesses.  The Supreme Court of New South Wales does not have the resources
to
investigate on motions brought by parties subpoenas issued by opposing parties
to strangers in the various cases coming before
it, as the plaintiff has
invited the Court to do in this case.  Accordingly, except where a stranger
challenges the legitimate forensic
purpose of the classes of documents caught
by a subpoena, the Court should be loath to investigate in detail the forensic
purpose
for which documents are sought by a party at the suit of the opposing
party. 
<P>

444   	In response to the plaintiff's submissions referred to in
paragraph 245 above, the defendant says:  the subpoena was almost
identical in
terms of that of the plaintiff;  this is not just a case on truth;
justification is but one aspect of the Defendant's
defence.
<P>

445   	The evidence does not show that the defendant
"<i>focused</i>" on the latter of 1998 and the early part on 1999 on truth.
The Court knows from the matters considered by it and the orders made
by it,
the evidence of Mr Angus at <i>T535.15-20</i>.  Mr Angus was primarily
concerned with completing the interlocutory aspects of the matter in the light
of the order for expedition.
<P>

446   	The evidence shows that the Defendant's preparedness to
accept discharge of the Police's obligations under the subpoena by
production
of the documents referred to in the meeting of 21 January 1999 was on the basis
of counsel's advice; and, on the basis
that Angus was not looking for dirt to
throw at the plaintiff (<i>T847.45-50);</i> and, in circumstances where Angus
had no idea that the Police had the documents comprising the statements of the
new complainants
when he issued the subpoena (<i>T849.20-30)</i>.  Further, it
was in circumstances where the information containing the 12 new complainants
was totally unexpected (<i>T855.55</i>).
<P>

447   	As to the suggestion (paragraph 246 hereof) of the
defendant's readiness to sacrifice all for the 12 names, this is contrary
to
the evidence of Ms Barnett: see <i>T996, T998.10-15, T993.20 </i>and
<i>T995.40.  </i>This evidence was not challenged.  Further, there is no
evidence Ms Barnett or anybody else knew about "<i>the 12 new complainants</i>"
prior to the issue of the subpoena.
<P>

448   	As to "<i>no legitimate forensic purpose</i>", and
"<i>lack of relevance</i>", these submissions are encompassed in the
submissions on "<i>fishing</i>". 
<P>

449   	The fact that the pre-trial discovery extends beyond
particular allegations identified in particulars is not unusual.  Merkel
J said
in <b><i>Esso v FCT </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20159%20ALR%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 159 ALR 604</a> at 701-2, it is a well
established rule that discoverable documents are not limited to documents which
would be evidence to prove
or disprove a matter in question in the action, and
that access is given on discovery for broader investigative purposes.
<P>

450   	The narrow view that a subpoena was oppressive when it
required the person to whom it was addressed to produce documents
described as
relating to a matter of fact that was capable of being an issue in the
proceedings or to a defined issue in the proceedings,
expressed by Rath J. in
<b><i>Finnie v Dalglish</i></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 400</a>, has not been followed and
is not consistent with authority: see <b><i>Southern Pacific Hotel Services v
Southern Pacific Hotel Corp</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NSWLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NSWLR 710</a> at 719, and <b><i>Lucas
Industries v Hewitt</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2018%20ALR%20557" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 18 ALR 557.</a>
<P>

451   	However, in <b><i>Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries
Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 92</a>, <b><i>Excel Finance Corp Ltd, Re; Worthley v
ASC</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20113%20ALR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 113 ALR 543</a> and <b><i>Adelaide Steamship Company v Spalvins,
Kent, Brandford, Russell</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20ACSR%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 ACSR 536</a> the Courts have said that
expressions such as <i>"relating to [a particular subject matter]"</i> may be
permissible.  In <b><i>Lucas Industries </i></b>the Full Federal Court held
that the mere use of the expression "<i>relating to [a particular subject
matter]" </i>did not impose of itself an unreasonable burden on a respondent.
The test was whether the class of documents was identified sufficiently
clearly
in the circumstances of the case.  The Court also held that while documents
required in subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> must be specified with reasonable
particularity, a degree of generality in the description of the documents,
might, according to
the circumstances, be compatible with reasonableness. 
<P>

452   	Generally speaking, the question of what is a reasonable
obligation to cast on a party to collect and produce documents on
a stranger is
a relevant circumstance.  What might be  burdensome to small entities might be
less so to large, highly organised and
well-staffed entities.
<P>

453   	In the present case it is relevant that the stranger and
the plaintiff adduced <u>no evidence</u> that they did know what documents were
required or that the search for would be unduly onerous. Of particular interest
is the fact
that the NSW Police had already collected the documents together to
respond to the plaintiff's subpoena: see the decision of Ireland
J of 24
December 1998 at page 3.
<P>

454   	The essence of an obligation to make discovery is that a
party decides whether documents in his possession relate to the
issues in the
action.  However a subpoena does not in terms seek to impose this task on a
respondent.  A subpoena seeks production
of documents the contents of which
relate to specified subjects.  A respondent does not have to direct his mind to
the issues in
the proceedings (see <b><i>Lucas Industries</i></b> at 569).
<P>

455   	The defendant submitted above that a subpoena can only
properly be used for the production of documents described in particular
or
general terms which does not involve the making of a judgment as to what is
relevant to the issues joined in the proceedings.
 However it does not follow
that because the party who issues a subpoena is unaware of the precise
description of a particular document,
or whether a particular document or
documents is in the possession of the witness, or even whether it exists, or is
unaware of its
contents, that the subpoena, or even a subpoena in general
terms, amounts to the use of the subpoena for the purpose of
"<i>discovery</i>".  This involves a misconception of the different functions
of discovery and of a subpoena for production: see <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b>
at 382B ff.
<P>

<b>Submissions from the Plaintiff in Reply</b>
<P>

456   	These were extensive and detailed.  What I consider to be
the salient points will here be referred to, especially those that
pick up some
of the defendant's submissions not hitherto mentioned.
<P>

457   	The power to set aside a subpoena is found in SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p37" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 37</a> r
8.  In any event, the power to prevent an abuse of its own process is an
inherent power of the court.  The defendant's submission
that the court has no
jurisdiction is not tenable.
<P>

458   	The defendant seems to present three submissions on
standing:
<P>

(a)	the plaintiff's interest in the protection of the documents produced under
the subpoena has been determined in separate proceedings;
<P>

(b)	the plaintiff's interest does not satisfy the test in
<b><i>Marcel</i></b>;
<P>

(c)	in the alternative, the plaintiff does not have standing to challenge the
validity of the subpoena on the ground that it is
fishing, oppressive and
unintelligible in form.
<P>

459   	As to (a):  this submission is "<i>incomprehensible",
</i>the plaintiff submits.
<P>

460   	As to (b):  whether or not this test is correct, there
can be no doubt that the <b><i>Marcel</i></b> test is satisfied where the
plaintiff's legal rights will be interfered with by the execution of the
subpoena.  In any event, this
court should follow the test adopted by
McClelland J in <b><i>Compsyd</i></b>.
<P>

461   	As to (c):  this submission raises a distinction which
has never been made in any of the cases.  The problem with the submission
is
that a fishing, oppressive or unintelligible subpoena is an abuse of process:
<b><i>Botany Bay </i></b>at 100-101.  A party obviously has an interest in
ensuring that the processes of the court are not abused in the very proceedings
where his rights are to be determined.
<P>

462   	The defendant seeks to distinguish <b><i>Johns v
ASC</i></b>.  It is true that that case concerns the provisions of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/asca1989364/" class="autolink_findacts">Australian Securities Commission Act 1989</a> (Cth</i>).  However, the fact that
a different statute was involved does not make the reasoning inapplicable.
Both the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/asca1989364/" class="autolink_findacts">Australian Securities Commission Act</a> </i>and the <i>Police Service
Act </i>have provisions concerning investigation of criminal allegations.  That
is why the reasoning in <b><i>Johns </i></b>may be applied in the present case.
That is, the same principle of statutory interpretation may be applied to a
closely analogous
statute. 
<P>

463   	As to the defendant's submission that <b><i>Johns
</i></b>and <b><i>Ainsworth </i></b>concerned "<i>a person's right to be heard
before a statutory tribunal published an adverse finding against the
person</i>", there are made two responses to this submission.  First,
<b><i>Johns</i></b> did not involve publication by a statutory tribunal of an
adverse finding but rather a decision by the ASC (being an investigative
body)
to disclose documents to a Royal Commission (being closely analogous to a
court).  That is the point of the analogy.  Secondly,
although <b><i>Ainsworth
</i></b>does involve a right to be heard before a statutory tribunal publishes
adverse findings, the point of that case for present purposes
is that an
adverse effect on one's reputation as a result of a decision is sufficient to
create an interest in the making of that
decision.  Here, the production of
documents by the Police in a defamation case obviously impacts directly upon
the plaintiff's reputation.
<P>

464   	As to this, I interpolate that it must be observed that
mere production cannot affect reputation.  Arguably inspection might;
 forensic
deployment certainly would.  But this <i>is</i> a defamation action, after
all.
<P>

465   	The defendant asserted that the <b><i>Batemans
Bay</i></b> case is inapplicable because it concerns standing to seek an
injunction to prevent a statutory corporation acting beyond its powers.
 There
are two responses made to this submission.  First, the <b><i>Batemans
Bay</i></b> case interprets the meaning of "<i>interest</i>" under the general
law:  if the plaintiff had a sufficient "<i>interest</i>" to seek an injunction
he would clearly have a sufficient "<i>interest</i>" to be heard on an
application to set aside a subpoena.  Secondly, there is a direct analogy
between the <b><i>Batemans Bay </i></b>case and the present because the
plaintiff asserts that the Police were acting ultra vires in entering into the
agreement with the
defendant to abuse the processes of the court (if, I
interpolate, these findings are made).
<P>

466   	The defendant submits that the plaintiff's submission
concerning <b><i>Marcel's </i></b>case is inapplicable because that case
concerned the right to be heard before the publication of an adverse finding.
That is incorrect,
it is said.  That case concerned the duties of the Police
when they were issued with a subpoena in civil litigation.  It is on all
fours
with the present case.
<P>

467   	It is noteworthy, the plaintiff responds, that the
defendant makes clear that it is only attempting to sustain paragraphs
B, C, D
and E of the subpoena dated 18 January 1999.  Accordingly, it is important to
note that there is apparently no issue that
the rest of the subpoena is
invalid.
<P>

468   	Paragraphs D and E of the subpoena cannot be relevant to
the truth of the imputations since they relate simply to conflicting
statements
made by D3 concerning allegations (of any kind) about Marsden (para D) and to
conflicting statements (relating to any
issue) made by Colin Fisk (para E).
Those paragraphs are "<i>absurd"</i>.  Further,  paragraph C is defective in
form because it does not refer to any form of document and may therefore be
disregarded.
 This submission I have rejected.  That leaves paragraph B.  That
paragraph is not relevant in terms to the particulars of truth
and contextual
truth because it is not confined to the complainants particularised.  Further,
the requirements of <i>SCR Pt 15 r 13(2)(b) </i>require that the defendant
particularise any allegation of truth even where that material is only used to
rebut the plaintiff's case
on the falsity of the imputation:  <b><i>King v John
Fairfax</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 31</a>, at 34A.  The plaintiff is not permitted to
"<i>fish</i>" for fresh particulars relating to the falsity of imputations on
the issue of damages any more than it is permitted to do so on the
defences of
truth and contextual truth. 
<P>

469   	For reasons noted in the preceding paragraph, it is
submitted, paragraphs C, D and E may be disregarded.  That leaves paragraph
B.
Again the same propositions put in the last paragraph apply here.  The
paragraph does not relate in terms to any of the complainants
particularised.
Again, the defendant is fishing for new particulars which if inserted in the
particulars could then be made the subject
of evidence and
cross-examination.
<P>

470   	It must first be noted here that there is no issue on the
pleadings about the plaintiff visiting premises other than Costellos
which are
used for juvenile male prostitution.  Again, the defendant is simply fishing
for this material.  So far as Costellos is
concerned, paragraphs C, D and E may
be disregarded.  Paragraph B is not in its terms confined to Costellos.  The
paragraph does
not relate to Costellos at all.  A paragraph drafted to pick up
allegations of under age sex at Costellos involving the plaintiff
and D2 would
pick up a matter relevant to the proceedings.  However, the paragraph is not
confined to under age sex at Costellos
by the plaintiff. 
<P>

471   	The justification particulars regarding D13-D16 were not
part of these proceedings on 18 January 1999 and therefore could
not relate to
any issue in the proceedings.
<P>

472   	There is nothing in paragraphs B-E which relates to D1.
<i>A fortiori </i>there is nothing which refers to statements being made by him
which are contradictory.  Again, if the paragraph were drafted in those
terms
and made specific there might be some possibility that it would be valid. 
<P>

473   	It is asserted that paragraph D of the subpoena deals
with records of investigations carried out in relation to statements
made by
D3.  Again, the problem with this paragraph is it refers to
"<i>conflicting</i>" statements (which requires a judgment to be formed which
is impermissible in a subpoena) and it relates to allegations of any kind
about
the plaintiff.  The paragraph is defective in form and could not relate to any
issue in the proceedings.
<P>

474   	The defendant asserts that paragraph E is relevant
because it deals with conflicting statements made by Colin John Fisk.
 Again,
it is not permissible in a subpoena to refer to "<i>conflicting statements</i>"
by any person since that requires a judgment to be formed by the recipient.
Further, the statements are not confined so that they
relate to John Marsden.
Accordingly, the paragraph is ridiculously wide and cannot relate to any issue
in the proceedings.  The mere
fact that a person is referred to in the matter
complained of and in some particulars of qualified privilege does not mean that
the
defendant is entitled to subpoena the Police regarding "<i>conflicting</i>"
statements made by that person over a five year period on any issue.
<P>

<b>As to discretionary matters (plaintiff in Reply)</b>
<P>

475   	In its submissions the defendant suggests that even if
the subpoena is an abuse of process and should have been set aside
at an
earlier time, it should not be set aside now for discretionary reasons.
<P>

476   	The following points seem to be made on behalf of the
defendant: 
<P>

(a)	the order for production is now spent and no longer has any operative
effect;
<P>

(b)	the plaintiff and the defendant have been granted access to the documents
produced under the subpoena and the plaintiff has
made a claim for privilege in
respect of some of those documents;
<P>

(c)	an earlier motion to set aside the subpoena was dismissed by me on 2 March
1999.
<P>

477   	Each of these matters are dealt with in turn.
<P>

478   	As to (a):  it cannot be said that the order to produce
contained in the subpoena no longer has operative effect.  The Police
have been
producing documents since 1 February 1999 and have done so on a number of
occasions.  It is not clear whether there are
any further documents to be
produced pursuant to the agreement entered into between the Police and the
defendant (see Exhibit 11,
tab 35).  Moreover, the Police have never purported
to comply with the whole of the subpoena.  Instead, they have purported, at
most,
to comply with the "<i>agreement"</i>.  It follows that the subpoena -
the order of the court - has never been fulfilled.  It is thus  quite incorrect
to say that the
subpoena "<i>was obeyed by production of documents to the court
on 1, 5, 11 February and 9 March</i>" or that "<i>the purpose of the order
which required production of the documents to the court has been
fulfilled</i>".  In any event, the defendant has not seen most of the documents
which were produced on 9 March 1999 and therefore there is still
utility in the
subpoena being set aside.  Further, it is clear that a subpoena may be set
aside and an order made for the delivery
up of the documents obtained even
after all the documents produced under subpoena have been inspected by the
issuing party:  see
<b><i>Marcel</i></b>, at 241E.
<P>

479   	As to (b):  the defendant has not had access to the
documents produced on 9 March.  Accordingly, the order to set aside the
subpoena is still of utility.  Further, as noted in the previous paragraph, an
order to set aside the subpoena may still be made.
<P>

480   	As to (c):  it was made clear on 2 March (transcript
pp.121-124) that the motion was not pressed on that occasion because
the
documents had already been produced and inspected by the defendant (a matter
urged upon the plaintiff's counsel by me).  But
on that same occasion it was
noted by counsel for the plaintiff that because it was an interlocutory
application there was no difficulty
with the plaintiff bringing a similar
application in the future if there was further production (as indeed happened
on 9 March 1999)
pursuant to the subpoena:  see affidavit of Ms Gillingham of
17 March 1999, paragraph 30.
<P>

481   	The plaintiff points to eleven reasons for not allowing
the amendment which individually and collectively amount to three
abuses of
process.  
<P>

482   	First, it is submitted that the subpoena to the Police
dated 18 January 1999 was an abuse of process and that the court should
not
condone such an abuse of process by allowing amendments to be effected on the
basis of material purportedly produced as a consequence
of that subpoena.
<P>

483   	Secondly, the agreement between the Police and the
defendant entered into in late January 1999 was an abuse of the processes
of
the court.
<P>

484   	Thirdly, the agreement between the Police and the
defendant and the disclosure by the Police of the material caught by the
agreement was a breach of confidence and ultra vires because it was beyond the
powers of the Police as contained in the <i>Police Service Act</i>. 
<P>

485   	Fourthly, the agreement and the disclosure by the Police
pursuant to it was a breach of two of the <i>Police Service Regulations</i>
which impose duties of the strictest confidence in relation to Police
investigatory material.
<P>

486   	Fifthly, the agreement and the disclosure by the Police
was a breach of the <i>Police Service Regulations</i> concerning impartiality:
The text of <i>Police Service Regulation</i> 9(7) which states that "<i>police
officers must be strictly impartial in the discharge of their duties towards
all persons".</i>
<P>

487   	Sixthly, the agreement by the Police with the defendant
and the disclosure pursuant to the agreement were beyond the powers
of the
Police (that is, ultra vires).
<P>

488   	Seventhly, the agreement between the Police and the
defendant and the disclosure by the Police pursuant to that agreement
were in
breach of the rules of natural justice.
<P>

489   	Eighthly, the Police were actuated by an improper purpose
in entering the agreement with the defendant.
<P>

490   	Ninthly, the defendant entered the agreement with the
Police for the improper purpose of obtaining new particulars of justification.

<P>

491   	Tenthly, the agreement between the Police and the
defendant allowed the Police (and not the court) to determine any claim
for
public interest immunity since documents subject to the asserted claim were
never produced to the court. 
<P>

492   	Eleventhly, the agreement between the plaintiff and the
defendant was a contempt of court on two bases:
<P>

(a)	a failure to produce to the court documents which were caught by subpoena
is a contempt of court<b><i>:  James v Cowan </i></b><i>(</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1929/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1929] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1929%29%2042%20CLR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1929) 42 CLR 305</a>,
<b><i>Commissioner Railways v Small</i></b> at 573-574; <b><i>Re Barnes</i></b>

<P>

(b)	to procure a person served with a subpoena not to produce the documents
referred to in it is also a contempt of court<b><i>:  Lane v Registrar of
Supreme Court of NSW</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 245</a>, particularly at 258-260.
<P>

493   	It is submitted in reply that in response to the
plaintiff's seventh submission that the agreement and the disclosure by
the
Police were in breach of the rules of natural justice, the defendant responds
by saying that the defendant notified the plaintiff
by letter of 18 January of
the issuing of the subpoena.  It should be noted that the plaintiff was never
given a copy of the terms
of the subpoena, no copy of the subpoena was appended
to the envelopes produced by the Police, there was no indication of the
material
to be produced, there was no notification of the agreement and in
particular there was no notification that 12 new complainants were
to be
provided.  The defendant does not seem to have any real answer to the
proposition that the actions of the Police were in breach
of the rules of
natural justice.  The following additional matters should be noted:
<P>

(a)	no copy of the schedule to the subpoena was produced despite the terms of
the subpoena:  see Gillingham's affidavit of 17 March
1999, para 11;
<P>

(b)	In a judgment of 2 March 1999 I held that a party is not entitled to access
to the other party's subpoenas before production
to the court by the recipient
of the subpoena:  see affidavit of Gillingham dated 17 March 1999, paras 3 and
4;
<P>

(c)	the Registry does not keep copies of subpoenas issued in the proceedings:
Gillingham affidavit of 17 March 1999, para 5;
<P>

(d)	the first notice the plaintiff had of the schedule to the subpoena was on
Thursday, 18 February 1999 (a week after the defendant
had inspected the
statements of D17-D25):  see affidavit of Gillingham dated 17 March 1999, paras
6 and 26;
<P>

(e)	the plaintiff first moved to set the subpoena aside four working days later
on Wednesday, 24 February 1999:  see affidavit of
Gillingham dated 17 March
1999, para 27;
<P>

(f)	the statements of D17-D25 were produced on 10 February 1999 (see affidavits
of Angus dated 18 February 1999, para 19 and 5 March
1999, para 3) in the
Registry rather than in court, eleven days after production began on 1 February
1999 (affidavit of Gillingham
dated 17 March 1999, para 9);
<P>

(g)	the defendant did not call upon the subpoena in open court on any day and
particularly not on 10 or 11 February:  Gillingham
affidavit of 12 April 1999,
paras 3 and 4;
<P>

(h)	on each occasion the documents were produced under the subpoena dated 18
January, including the occasion on which the statements
of D17-D25 were
produced, orders for first access were sought by the plaintiff but denied by
Deputy Registrar Howe:  affidavit of
Gillingham dated 17 March 1999, para
17;
<P>

(i)	there was a vast quantity of material produced by the Police in answer to
the subpoena:  Phillips Fox have arranged the material
into 20 large lever arch
files;  the documents which the statements of D17-D25 were produced on 10
February 1999 filled 9 large lever
arch files:  affidavit of Gillingham dated
12 April 1999, para 8;
<P>

(j)	Ms Gillingham was principally concerned to claim privilege over material
given by the plaintiff to the Police (see her affidavit
of 17 March 1999 para
18);  she did not have any opportunity to read the new complainant's statements
in any detail as she was under
considerable pressure:  she did not have the
benefit of an order for first access and Mr Price at Mallesons was waiting a
few feet
away while she skimmed through the material (para 18 of her affidavit
of 17 March 1999);
<P>

(k)	Ms Gillingham had no way of knowing about "the deal" that had been struck
in January between Mr Singleton and Mr Angus (see
Exhibit 11, tabs 32 and
35);
<P>

(l)	the Police had set aside the plaintiff's subpoena of October 1998 which
sought material relating to Mr Marsden on the basis
of its width;  they also
challenged particular aspects of the subpoena on the basis of no legitimate
forensic purpose and public
interest immunity (Exhibit 11, tab 23 and the
judgment of Ireland J of 24 December 1999);  Ms Gillingham was entitled to
assume that
the Police would have taken the same attitude towards subpoenas
issued at the request of the defendant (ie. that material would not
be produced
if the subpoena was oppressive, lacked a legitimate forensic purpose, sought
documents the subject of public interest
immunity or related to investigations
into Mr Marsden generally);
<P>

(m)	at the time of production pursuant to the subpoena of 18 January 1999, many
other things were going on at the same time, including
the first round of the
defendant's amendment application, the defendant's first trip to the Court of
Appeal and the questions about
jury procedure (see the affidavit of Gillingham
dated 17 March 1999, para 22 and Mr Angus' affidavits of 4 and 8 February
1999).
<P>

494   	To the plaintiff's eighth submission that the Police were
actuated by the improper purpose of procuring an adjournment in
entering into
the agreement with the defendant, there is no contrary submission except that
the plaintiff's submissions are made
without evidence to support them.
Accordingly, the twelve references to the evidence are made  set out.  I will
not repeat them.
<P>

495   	To the plaintiff's ninth proposition that the defendant
was actuated by an improper purpose in entering into the agreement
with the
Police, the defendant simply responds by saying that there is no evidence cited
in support of the propositions in the plaintiff's
submissions.  The plaintiff
here asserts nine evidence references which I will not repeat.
<P>

496   	To the plaintiff's tenth submission that the Police and
not the court is to determine claims for public interest immunity,
the
defendant's key proposition was that it was quite legitimate for the Police not
to produce to the court documents which the Police
asserted were subject to
public interest immunity.  This is an "<i>absolutely outrageous
submission"</i>, the plaintiff submits.  If the recipient of a subpoena wishes
to claim public interest immunity those documents must be produced
to the court
which will then determine the validity of the claim.  Any contrary submission
involves an assertion that the Crown and
not the court is to determine claims
for public interest immunity.  There is no basis at all for this submission.
<P>

<b>Conclusions, Findings &amp; Orders</b>
<P>

497   	As, I trust, can be seen, the Court was well served by
extensive and detailed and compelling submissions both oral (from
five counsel)
and written.  Having concluded that otherwise the defendant is entitled to be
granted leave to amend (subject to reduced
particulars), the asserted ultimate
bar - the subpoena issue - falls for consideration and resolution.
<P>

498   	The plaintiff moves to set aside the defendant's subpoena
as an abuse of process of the Court and SCR Pt 37 r 8 provides
that the Court
may, or of its own motion or on the motion of any person having sufficient
interest, set aside the subpoena wholly
or in part.  The plaintiff contends, as
has been indicated, that there are five bases for his having standing to seek
this relief.
<P>

499   	The first is that he is a party to the proceedings.
Reliance is placed by the plaintiff on the decision of Powell J in <b><i>Botany
Bay</i></b> <i>(supra)</i>;  however I am of the opinion that the proper
principles in this regard are those referred to above by McClelland J in
<b><i>Compsyd</i></b> <i>(supra)</i>.  I agree however with the submissions of
the plaintiff that the decision of Hunt J in <b><i>Wran v ABC</i></b><i>
(supra)</i> can probably be viewed as being reached <i>per incuriam</i>, his
Honour making no reference to the relevant Rule of Court at 264F.  The
connection between the party and the documents the subject
of the subpoena
sought to be set aside as an abuse of process (and thus vitiate the production
of the documents), must, in my view,
be established.  
<P>

500   	Thus one turns to the second basis relied upon namely
that the documents contain information confidential to the plaintiff.
 Reliance
is placed upon the <i>Police Service Regulations</i> as to confidentiality.
Here the situation appears to me to become somewhat blurred.  The object of the
exercise on the part of the
plaintiff in seeking the relief is to preclude
production of the documents to the Court.  Assuming the validity of the
subpoena,
confidentiality, even in my view within the passage from
<b><i>Johns</i></b> cited above and relied upon by the plaintiff, is a matter
that does not go to the production to the Court but to the issue of inspection
(save in cases, and clear cases, of public interest immunity).  
<P>

501   	The same problem affects the third basis upon which the
plaintiff relies namely, <i>"disclosure</i>" of the material the subject of the
subpoena would affect the plaintiff's reputation, reliance being upon
<b><i>Johns</i></b> and <b><i>Ainsworth</i></b>.  It is said that disclosure of
the documents would have an obvious impact on the reputation of the plaintiff
and that is sufficient
to ground standing, that is, to set aside the subpoena
to preclude production to the Court, or if production has been effected, to
make orders of the kind made by Powell J in <b><i>Botany Bay</i></b>.  The
matter of reputation is again one that attends the question of inspection.  To
the extent that the plaintiff has moved already
to preserve his interest in
relation to certain of the documents and denied access to the defendant
thereby, any claim in this regard,
in my view, has been satisfied.  I would add
that it is curious that in a defamation action that disclosure affecting
reputation
would be sufficient by itself to provide a basis for standing to set
aside a subpoena as an abuse of process.  
<P>

502   	I reject the submission of the plaintiff that production,
and it is to be noted that this is framed in terms of "<i>production</i>" as
opposed to inspection, let alone forensic deployment, would affect the economic
interest of the plaintiff based upon <b><i>Batemans Bay</i></b>.  The plaintiff
points to damages as constituting the economic interests that would be
affected.  I do not see any basis that they
could be affected by the production
or inspection of the documents.  Their subsequent deployment legitimately could
have that effect
but that would conform with the purpose of the exercise on the
part of the defendant, namely, to deprive the plaintiff of damages
or to
minimise his award of them.
<P>

503   	As to the fifth ground, the principles of natural justice
require Police to notify a person under investigation of the right
to be heard
before a decision to disclose Police investigation documents is taken where
that disclosure would be prejudicial to his
interests, again the
"<i>blurring</i>" occurs.  There is no disclosure by the mere production by the
Police to the Court of the documents.  It is that process that the
plaintiff is
seeking to obviate by having the subpoena set aside.  Otherwise the course
available to him is to take steps which he
in fact has taken to prevent
inspection of the documents.  In this context it is to be noted that the
plaintiff took no steps to
protect any interest in relation to the documents
produced to the Court by the Police in relation to D17 to D25 in any event.
<P>

504   	In the circumstances at very best I have the greatest
reservations as to whether or not Mr Marsden has the standing to seek
the
remedy he does.  However as the Rule provides that the Court can on its own
motion set aside the subpoena in whole or in part,
I would consider it to be
conformable with practice and principle that the Court having decided to take
that course note the plaintiff's
submissions on that issue.
<P>

505   	In that context, I then turn to the various bases upon
which (assuming standing or that the Court is acting on its own motion),
it is
contended that the subpoena is an abuse of process.
<P>

506   	Conformably with the submissions for the defendant the
plaintiff, in my view, cannot be heard to argue that the subpoena
constitutes
an abuse of process by reason of being "<i>oppressive</i>".  That is a matter
for the recipient of the subpoena.  In this case the Police Service has taken
no step to have it set aside in
that respect (or, indeed, in any other).
<P>

507   	I am however persuaded that it is open to a person in the
position of the plaintiff to argue that on its face the subpoena
can be
characterised as "<i>fishing</i>".  Bearing in mind the power of the Court to
set aside a subpoena in whole or in part, it seems to me that a great deal of
the force
in any submission as to "<i>fishing</i>" is removed by the
abandonment by the defendant of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of section A.  The
defendant has similarly abandoned A17.
 Bearing in mind the tests to be applied
in the determination of whether or not a subpoena is "<i>fishing</i>" I must
say I would have reservations about A22.
<P>

508   	The focus however of the whole of this application in
reality is the production of documents that has lead to the defendant's
leave
application in respect to D17 to D25.  The focus of that real element is made
up of paragraphs B and C of the subpoena to which
I will return.
<P>

509   	As to paragraphs D and E these paragraphs of the subpoena
on their face clearly constitute the proscribed seeking of discovery
from a
third party.  The requirement for the formation of judgment is quite clear by
the mere insertion of the words, at the very
least, in relation to
<i>conflicting</i> statements in each of the paragraphs.  Neither of those
paragraphs can survive.
<P>

510   	The next paragraph of the subpoena to be dealt with is
paragraph C.  As I have made clear in the course of this judgment
I accept that
the omission of the introductory words cannot on any reasonable basis be
characterised as otherwise than a typographical
error.
<P>

511   	I have no difficulty at all in coming to the conclusion
that paragraph B of the subpoena cannot be impugned on any of the
bases I have
found to be available to the plaintiff to have that paragraph set aside as an
abuse of process.  I find that paragraph
B dealing with the Inkster
investigations refers to identifiable and relevant material, relevant
substantively and adjectivally to
the issues in the trial and does not amount
to fishing.  In this regard I accept the submissions of the defendant.  
<P>

512   	As to paragraph C at the time of the issue of the
subpoena, 18 January 1999, the evidence clearly is, as indeed advanced
by the
plaintiff, that the defendant was aware of investigations being carried out by
Superintendent Woodhouse.  The context or nature
of such investigations must
have been abundantly clear as involving the sexual conduct of the plaintiff.
That conduct is the essence
of this trial in terms of the defence of
justification and the plaintiff's assertion that the imputations are false.  In
this regard
I state that I am satisfied that it was forensically legitimate for
the defendant to seek corroboration of allegations of truth on
the pleadings
and in opposition to the assertion of falsity and to obtain material for the
cross-examination of the plaintiff on,
at least, those issues.  In this respect
I accept the evidence of Mr Angus.
<P>

513   	Thus, in relation to paragraph C none of the bases
hitherto relied upon support the position of the plaintiff.
<P>

514   	The real complaint of the plaintiff is what is alleged to
be the "<i>conspiracy</i>" or the "<i>deal</i>" arising from a "<i>secret
meeting</i>" between representatives of the Police Service and the solicitors
for the defendant.
<P>

515   	By reason of my acceptance of the evidence of Mr Angus,
Ms Barnett and Mr Woodhouse I am simply unable to conclude that the
purpose of
the issue of the subpoena was to fish for "<i>new complainants</i>".  Such a
finding would be, in my respectful view, perverse in light of Mr Angus'
evidence;  he did not have <i>"a clue</i>" as to what would be forthcoming.
The purpose of the subpoena was as referred to above in the evidence of Mr
Angus.  Further, I do
not find there to have been agreement between the
solicitors for the defendant and the Police as articulated in the plaintiff's
submissions.
 On the evidence I am unable to find any "<i>secret</i>" deal;
the arrangement conforms with practice and was founded, in my view, I find, in
a sensible approach to potential disputation
and litigation on the issue of
production.
<P>

516   	Further, I cannot accept that the purpose of the Police
in providing this material was to thwart the trial and have it adjourned.
 I
can conceive of no reason why the Police would wish to do so.  The more so is
this the case in the context of there being no evidence
of Mr Marsden having
been charged;  of their being evidence that the Crown advised against the
Police seeking a stay of proceedings,
and up to now there being no evidence of
the outcome of Mr Woodhouse's report in March to the DPP. 
<P>

517   	When one takes into account the evidence of Mr Potter the
practice of having meetings and making arrangements with recipients
of
subpoenas as to production of documents is an accepted one.  Similarly it is
accepted that when one party embarks upon that exercise
that party does not
inform its opponent.  This is not a matter of a "<i>secret meeting</i>";  it is
a matter of usual practice.  Indeed, it is a practice which I accept on the
evidence so entrenched, and indeed, recommended
by the decisions in addition to
that of myself referred to above, that it can operate concurrently with the
provisions of SCR Pt
37 r 11 which only provides for the alteration of the time
specified in the subpoena for attendance and production.  The Rule is
otherwise
silent.
<P>

518   	The trenchant criticism made of the Police Service with
respect to the assertion of a claim for public interest immunity
is
misconceived, in the end, and on the evidence, in my view.  Of course it is
clear law that it is not for the Police to <i>state </i>that documents are
protected by public interest immunity;  that is a matter only for the Courts
(<b><i>Sankey vWhitlam</i></b> <i>(supra))</i>.  It is quite open to the Police
in what I regard as legitimate discussions with the party issuing the subpoena
to indicate that
in respect of documents caught by the subpoena that those
documents would be the subject of <i>claim</i> for public interest immunity.
In the face of a statement to that effect by the Police, it is perfectly open
to the party issuing
the subpoena to choose not to litigate that claim.  That
does not amount to the abrogation to the Police by the Police of the function
of the Court.  I do not understand Mr Woodhouse to have been seeking to assert
that the documents "<i>affected by public interest immunity</i>" were in fact
protected as a matter of law by that doctrine.  His position was that in the
event that the subpoena was called upon
a body of the material would be subject
to such a claim.  The defendant was entitled to elect not to litigate such a
claim.
<P>

519   	What in reality I find to have occurred, on the evidence,
can be described as a "<i>windfall</i>" for the defendant.  That
"<i>windfall</i>" I find not to have been the consequence of any impropriety on
the part of the Police or on the part of the defendant's solicitors.
 It may
have been desirable I will go so far as to say, that not only, once an
arrangement was made between the defendant's solicitors
and the Police, would
the documents be produced "<i>without fanfare", </i>they should have been
produced "<i>without comment</i>".  The fact that Mr Singleton used the
unfortunate expression of "<i>without fanfare</i>" (which can fairly can be
understood as meaning without the prosecution of a claim for public interest
immunity), and the fact that
Mr Singleton appears to have taken it upon himself
to describe some of the material as "<i>interesting</i>" and referring to there
being "<i>new complainants</i>" does not impugn the arrangement.  When one
considers the totality of the evidence the reference to "<i>new</i>"
complainants is not surprising given that Mr Inkster had conducted his
inquiries into his complainants (as-it-were) and that was
followed by the
inquiries conducted by Mr Woodhouse into complainants he was investigating,
such complainants being able to be described
as "<i>new</i>" that is, thitherto
uninvestigated.
<P>

520   	What in reality has here occurred is that legitimate
processes have produced an unforeseen result.  The indignation of the
plaintiff
is understandable but does not justify the use of the result to impugn the
process that brought it about.
<P>

521   	The evidence called for the defendant and taking into
account the evidence of Mr Potter as to matters of practice, makes
it
impossible for me to conclude that the defendant embarked upon anything
otherwise than a legitimate exercise in the preparation
of the defence case for
trial involving, I find, no improper "<i>agreement</i>" or "<i>deal</i>" with
the Police.  The consequence, as I have said, was a "<i>windfall</i>" in
respect of which, as I have already found, the defendant's solicitors acted
promptly and with due care.
<P>

522   	As to the charge of the lack of partiality on the part of
the Police, this is founded in what is perceived to be the Police
response to
the plaintiff's subpoena dealt with by Ireland J on 24 December 1998 and their
response to the defendant's subpoena of
18 January 1999.  The critical feature
of the history of events is the interview of the plaintiff by the Police on 29
January.  Shortly
stated, that changed virtually everything as far as the
Police were concerned.  Indeed, it can be seen that as at that date (and
the
subsequent further meetings with Mr Lee), the Police had put to Mr Marsden all
that they had to put to him and provided him with
an opportunity of which he
availed himself to deal with the allegations.  If that important fact is kept
in mind there is no reasonable
basis upon which the charge of partiality can be
made against the Police Service.
<P>

523   	Thus, in summary, insofar as the plaintiff has no
standing to set aside the subpoena on the basis of abuse of process and
I have
exercised the discretion which the Court clearly has to consider that issue,
whilst various components of the subpoena can
be impugned upon the bases to
which I have referred, in the end, in the exercise of my discretion, I decline
to set it aside.  The
plaintiff has failed to establish the real and principal
basis of attack upon the whole exercise, namely the impropriety of the motive
of the defendant in issuing the subpoena and entering an agreement to obtain
twelve new complainants, to seek to amend and to adjourn
the trial to the
prejudice to the point of injustice of the plaintiff.  Further, even if there
are components of the documents in
fact produced that are still subject to
argument as to inspection by the Police both before me and in the Court of
Appeal, in terms
of the practical administration of this trial, the exercise of
the answering of this subpoena has been effectively completed.  In
this regard
I must remark upon one submission made for the plaintiff.  It was suggested
that if I found that the amendments were
based upon information improperly
obtained, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 138</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW) </i>would forever preclude
the defendant from relying upon that material.  With that proposition I cannot
agree.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 138</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i> is concerned with
admissibility and its operation would be triggered by the tendering of the
evidence at which time many forensic
events might have taken place subsequent
to those which have occupied the Court for the last two months which seriously
could affect
the operation of the section.
<P>

524   	Another issue is the question of
"<i>confidentiality/secrecy</i>" imposed upon the Police by the regulations in
the <i>Police Service Regulations</i>.  The submissions of the plaintiff were
not really addressed by the defendant.  In the instant case, although as a
matter of discretion
I have decided not to set aside the subpoena had I done so
there still would have remained paragraphs B and C as a valid order of
the
Court.  I mention this in the light of the concession made for the plaintiff
that a valid order of the Court constituted by a
subpoena would also be
"<i>proper authority"</i> in terms of the regulations.  I express the view that
it would constitute a basis for the non-maintenance of confidentiality and
secrecy - in the absence of a successful claim for public interest immunity -
to the extent that the Police Service would be required
to comply with the
order of the Court and produce to the Court the relevant documents.  In the
absence of full argument as to the
ramifications of the obligations of
confidentiality and secrecy generally as affecting the Police Service, I really
can say no more
than what I have said.  It was suggested that at the very least
it would have been the "<i>honourable</i>" thing for the Police to have done to
inform the plaintiff of the fact of the subpoena, the outcome of the
discussions which I have
found to be legitimate and the proposal to produce
documents to the Court.  I do not consider there to be any need nor consider it
to be appropriate for me to comment one way or the other on this proposition.
In the light of the acknowledgment that a valid subpoena
constitutes the proper
authority, there is no breach of any obligation of confidentiality or secrecy
in my view, by the compliance
by the Police Service with the order of the Court
in producing the documents to the Court.
<P>

525   	These applications amongst other things have highlighted
the practicalities of litigation in terms of the issuing and service
and
compliance with subpoenas that might not otherwise be brought to the attention
of the judge.  In the normal course of events
naturally the judge is concerned
with the tendering of material which is usually identified as having come from
subpoenaed documents.
 One matter is that the form of the subpoena requires
that the recipient produce to the Court not only the documents but the subpoena
itself.  The schedule to the subpoena is the critical thing, of course, and it
seems to be the practice that the envelope containing
the documents usually has
affixed to it the front page only of the subpoena and thus not the schedule.
The availability of the schedule
might go some way to alerting parties to the
possibility that production having taken place, an application can be made
either for
first access or for restricted access.  Another matter is Practice
Note 51 which relates to the subpoena for production does not
apply to
defamation proceedings and any notice to the other side of the subpoena having
been issued by leave is not required.
<P>

526   	The outcome shall involve the dismissal of the
plaintiff's Notices of Motion and orders pursuant to the defendant's Notices
of
Motion.
<P>

527   	There are still a great deal of interlocutory matters
outstanding including the issue of the availability of the contextual
imputations, an outstanding matter relating to access, an application by the
plaintiff as to the structure of the trial, an application
by the defendant in
relation to the Replies filed by the plaintiff and any application to be made
in respect to the use of pseudonyms.
<P>

528   	Of more immediate concern are orders to be made
consequential upon the resolution of the present Notices of Motion.  I am
satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to an adjournment but I am not
persuaded, particularly given the refusal of leave in relation
to D25, that the
period thereof should be in excess of three months.  Other orders I have in
mind to facilitate the early resumption
of the trial and the investigation of
the new claims by the plaintiff, include the delivery by the defendant to the
plaintiff of
signed proofs of evidence of D17 to D24 and other witnesses in
regard to those complainants together with copies of any physical
evidence
(photographs, plans, etc.), upon which the defendant intends to rely.  Those
matters would be the subject of delivery within
7 days.
<P>

529   	Further, terms will include the defendant agreeing to the
presentation of its case in a particular order presumably commencing
with D1 to
D6 then D13 to D16 then D17 to D24 with an indication to the plaintiff of the
identity of the witnesses to be called in
respect of each block.  Naturally,
some allowance will have to be made for flexibility in this regard depending
upon the availability
of witnesses, particularly any witness who might at the
relevant time be in custody.  The matters referred to in paragraphs 528 and
529
can be dealt with when the matter is next listed for directions.
<P>

530   	It is in everyone's interests that the substantive
hearing resumes this year.  It would be unfortunate, to say the least,
if, of
this case commenced in 1995, it was to be said that this penultimate year of
the century was devoted to interlocutory matters
and next year, the last of the
millennium, was devoted to the balance of the trial.
<P>

531   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The Notice of Motion in each action filed by the plaintiff on 7 May 1999 is
dismissed.
<P>

2.	The Notice of Motion filed by the plaintiff on 12 March 1999 to set aside
the defendant's subpoena is dismissed.
<P>

3.	In respect of the Notice of Motion filed by the defendant in Court on 22
March 1999 seeking leave to amend:
<P>

(a)	the defendant has leave to file a Third Further Amended Defence to the
Third Further Amended Statement of Claim in proceedings
20223/95 in accordance
with the form of MFI 1.
<P>

(b)	the defendant has leave to file a Further Amended Defence to the Second
Further Amended Statement of Claim in proceedings 20592/96
in accordance with
MFI 2.
<P>

(c)	the defendant has leave to rely on the particulars of justification
contained in the Second Consolidated Particulars of Truth
(Exhibit R) served on
12 March 1999 save for paragraphs 7(20), 8(23), 9(4), 9(12), 15, 16, 19 and 20
which are struck out, and as
amended by letters from Mallesons Stephen Jaques
to Phillips Fox dated 17 March 1999 (Exhibit S).
<P>

(d)	leave to amend in respect of D25 is thereby refused.
<P>

4.	I stand the matter over for further directions to a date to be fixed.
<P>

5.	The exhibits on the applications are to be retained.
