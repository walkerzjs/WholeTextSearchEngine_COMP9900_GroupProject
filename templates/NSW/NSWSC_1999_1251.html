<P>

<b>20729/1997 - JOHNSON v DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES &amp; ORS (NO
2)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1   	In reasons I gave on 2 December 1999, I upheld the
appellant's appeal against the refusal of Master Harrison to extend the
time
under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 to enable the appellant to bring
proceedings against the respondents, and I ordered the respondents to pay his
costs of the
proceedings before Master Harrison and of the appeal.  I was
satisfied, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 13</a>, that it was appropriate to make that
cost order in all the circumstances of the case.
<P>

2   	The appellant then sought an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 9(1)</a>, which provides:-
<P>

<b>"Where before the conclusion of any proceedings, other than proceedings
entered in the Commercial List or the Construction List, the
Court makes an
order for the payment of costs or a motion is refused with costs, the costs
shall not, unless the Court otherwise
orders, be payable until the conclusion
of the proceedings."</b>
<P>

3   	The appellant submitted that it was appropriate for the
Court to order that the costs the respondents have been ordered to
pay be
assessed and paid immediately upon assessment.  He submitted that the
proceedings for extension of time under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b>, albeit of an
interlocutory nature and part of the ultimate proceedings, were a discrete part
thereof and that, save for a successful
appeal against my decision, these are
costs of which he will not be deprived.  The further submission was made that
the appellant
was not in a strong financial position and was receiving
financial assistance to prosecute these proceedings against respondents,
which
are obviously adequately funded.  A further submission was made that it is
obvious from the posture taken by the respondents,
which is said in no critical
way, that these proceedings will be fought to the end, the respondents taking
the view that the appellant
is not entitled to succeed having regard to the
decision in <b>Williams v Minister, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/843.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] NSWSC 843</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2025%20FamLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999)
25 FamLR 86.</a>  In these circumstances, the submissions continued, that the
appellant may well be left without the continuance of financial assistance,
unless the costs to which I have found he is entitled are paid forthwith.
<P>

4   	It should be noted, immediately, that the appellant offered
no evidence as to his financial position, although I am prepared
to infer, and
the contrary was not argued, that it is weak.  But, perhaps more importantly,
he offered no evidence of the financial
assistance he is receiving and whether
it would be in any way prejudiced by the failure to make the order which is now
sought.  It
is also necessary to bear in mind that the making of the order the
appellant now seeks will have the effect of recompensing him for
some of the
costs incurred in fighting the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> issue and, it may be, that
this will replenish whatever monetary fund there is available to continue with
the main proceedings. 
However, as I have said, there was no evidence of these
arrangements or that effect.
<P>

5   	In these circumstances I think the evidence only enables me
to infer that the appellant does not enjoy a financial position
sufficient to
enable him to fully fund this litigation and that the respondents are able to
fund it.
<P>

6   	I should also note that whilst my decision was given on 2
December 1999, the respondents had not, as at 15 December 1999, made
a decision
as to whether they would seek leave to appeal.  The respondents take the view
that they have until 30 December 1999 to
file a Summons for Leave to Appeal,
subject to any time that may run during vacation.
<P>

7   	The respondents submitted, firstly, that this is not an
appropriate case to make the order sought by the appellant as the appellant
has
already obtained a cost advantage by reason of the orders I have made pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 13.</a>  That, if I may say so with respect, does not seem to me to
be a valid answer to the point now raised by the respondents, because
I have
decided that that is the basis on which the appellant is entitled to costs.
The question then becomes, relevantly for present
purposes, when those costs
should be paid.
<P>

8   	Secondly, the respondents submitted that by the grant of
the extension of time they were prejudiced, in the sense that they
will have to
defend the appellant's proceedings.  Any prejudice, as appears from the reasons
of the Master and my reasons, is presumptive
and, in my opinion, is irrelevant
to the matter I am now called upon to determine.
<P>

9   	Thirdly, and correctly, the respondents submitted that an
order extending the limitation period is an interlocutory and not
a final
order: <b>Merton Enterprises Pty Limited v Nelson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 454.</a>  In
that case the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal from Wood J's order
dismissing an appeal from a Master's decision extending
time.  In doing so,
their Honours held that no appeal lay as of right from the learned Judge's
decision but only by leave of the
Court; that leave to appeal should be
refused; and that the defendant should bear the plaintiff's costs of the
defendant's proceedings
in the Court of Appeal.
<P>

10   	It was submitted by the respondents that as the
application is interlocutory in nature it is "part of the proceedings in
relation
to the Plaintiff's cause of action which is no longer statute
barred".
<P>

11   	In my opinion many circumstances where an order for costs
is made in which it is appropriate to consider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 9(1)</a> will be in
consequence of decisions in interlocutory proceedings, because they are the
decisions made prior to the conclusion of
the proceedings and, accordingly, I
think that the rule must be looking towards, at least amongst other situations,
costs made in
interlocutory proceedings.  Therefore, in so far as the
respondents rely upon the fact that the order is interlocutory in nature,
I am
of the view that that does not enable them, of itself, to resist the order
sought by the appellant.
<P>

12   	The respondents referred to the decision in <b>Thunderdome
Racetiming and Scoring Pty Limited v Dorian Industries Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/291.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 291</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2036%20FCR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
36 FCR 297.</a>  At p.312 Olney J said, in referring to the equivalent Federal
Court Rule:-
<P>

<b>"The rule does not suggest any particular criteria by which the Court should
be guided in approaching such an application, and accordingly
I take the view
that the discretion should be exercised in favour of a party who establishes
that the demands of justice require
that there be a departure from" the general
rule.</b>
<P>

It was not suggested that the categories were closed, but that examples may be
where the opponent's action has taken the other party,
and perhaps, the Court
by surprise; where a matter could have been raised earlier and costs have been
unnecessarily incurred; where
the interlocutory relief is distinct from the
primary relief; and where the applicant would not recover costs for a
significant period
if obliged to wait until the conclusion of the proceedings.
The first two points have no part to play in this case.
<P>

13   	In my opinion the interlocutory relief in this case is,
relevantly, distinct from the primary relief.  It is the hurdle the
appellant
had to scale to be entitled to pursue the substantive relief.  I see no
particular difference between it and, for example,
an application to strike out
an originating process as failing to disclose a cause of action.  Generally, if
such an application
is made and fails, I would consider it an appropriate
exercise of discretion to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs
of
the Motion.  In my view, there are many cases in which it is appropriate that
final costs orders should be made on the determination
of interlocutory
proceedings, rather than reserving the costs or making them, in some way, costs
in the proceedings.  Certainly I
do not know of any rule of practice, which
precludes this course.
<P>

14   	This is also a case where it can be anticipated that the
principal proceedings will not be heard for some time.  Indeed, as
I have
noted, the respondents have not, as yet, decided whether there will be an
application for leave to appeal from my decision.
 As some gauge as to the
period before which the proceedings will be heard I note that in <b>Williams v
Minister, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983</a> &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 497</a>,
the Court of Appeal heard the application for leave to appeal on 23 August 1994
and delivered judgment on 23 December 1994.  Thereafter
an application for
special leave to appeal to the High Court was filed and either not pursued or
dismissed.  But the proceedings
did not come on for hearing until 1999, so that
some four years, or perhaps a little longer, expired from the Court of Appeal's
decision
until the hearing.  There is no reason to think that the present case
will come on for hearing any more quickly and, even if the
time in
<b>Williams</b> was reduced by 25 per cent, the hearing is unlikely to take
place for several years.
<P>

15   	Accordingly, it seems to me, that the appellant has
satisfied the third and fourth criteria to which reference is made.
<P>

16   	I was referred by the respondents to various other cases,
although, generally speaking, those set forth in paragraph 7 of
the written
submissions dealt with some form of misconduct on the part of the party against
whom or which the order was sought and,
correctly in my view, the respondents
have submitted that no such considerations apply to them.
<P>

17   	Finally, it was submitted by the respondents that an
application for an extension of time does not fall within the usual meaning
of
"discrete" or "separate" issues in the sense of that term as used in <b>Charlie
Brown Pty Limited &amp; Anor v Green &amp; Ors</b> (McLelland CJinEq - 3 July
1995 - unreported) and <b>Prebble v Australian Broadcasting Commission</b>
(Levine J - 11 July 1997 - unreported).  In the first case McLelland CJinEq, in
dealing with an application of the type with which
I am concerned, said:-
<P>

<b>"The matters dealt with in the determination of the separate questions were
matters fundamental to the relationship of the parties,
and raised issues which
are quite discrete from any other relief claimed in the proceedings.  It was
appropriate that those matters
should be dealt with separately and, it is in my
view also appropriate that now that they have been dealt with, the costs
relating
to them should be assessable and payable forthwith."</b>
<P>

18   	In the present case it was submitted by the respondents
that they had raised that the appellant should not be granted leave
because the
decision in <b>Williams (No 2)</b> meant that the case was futile.  I
appreciate that this was not an application to strike out the Statement of
Claim.  Rather the
submission was that to allow the proceedings to go forward
was not justified because, having regard to <b>Williams No 2</b>, the appellant
could never succeed.  Indeed, it was this submission, in its various
manifestations, which took up a substantial part
of the hearing time.  I
determined that those issues could not be resolved until the facts in this case
had been found and, to that
extent, it seems to me that I was dealing with a
discrete issue.  As was submitted on behalf of the appellant on the principal
hearing
the "futility" argument of the respondents was really a demurrer type
argument.  However one describes it, it required a consideration
going to the
heart of the litigation and, whilst I appreciate that it will be necessary to
consider the matters raised by the respondents
in the factual context, the
matter proceeded before me on the basis that either irrespective of the facts
as proved or because the
facts as pleaded were so closely allied with those in
<b>Williams No 2</b>, that I was bound to hold that the appellant had no causes
of action.  I declined, for the reasons I have given, to come to that
conclusion.  That matter, in my view, relevantly for present purposes,
reinforces the conclusion that all the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> proceeding was in
the nature of or raised a discrete issue.
<P>

19   	In <b>Prebble</b> the motion was to seek to conclude the
principal proceedings as an abuse of process.  That was resolved in the
plaintiff's favour
such that "all that in reality remains is the disposition of
the plaintiff's case for damages for defamation in the usual way". 
Levine J
referred to the passage from <b>Charlie Brown</b> to which I have referred and
to his own judgment in <b>Oliver v Bryant &amp; Ors</b> (15 May 1995 -
unreported) and held, in the particular circumstances of that case, that an
order should be made pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 9.</a>
<P>

20   	Obviously every case will have its own particular factual
characteristics and the way in which the wide discretion in relation
to costs
is to be exercised will be a matter for the individual Judge having heard the
proceedings, although informed by the principles
to which I have referred.
<P>

21   	In the present case I have come to the conclusion,
essentially because I am satisfied that, relevantly for present purposes,
the
interlocutory relief is sufficiently distinct from the primary relief, and the
appellant will not recover his costs for a significant
period if obliged to
wait for the conclusion of the proceedings and, finally, because of the
particular issues raised on the hearing
before me, that it is appropriate, in
the exercise of my discretion to make an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 9.</a>  I
also, of course, have taken account of what was accepted as the appellant's
financial position, although that was not ultimately
determinative.  In doing
so I am acutely aware of two things.  Firstly, I have to have regard to the
fact that there may be a successful
appeal from my decision.  Secondly, as was
much pressed upon me, the Court of Appeal in <b>Williams (No 1)</b> ordered
that the costs of the Motion before the trial Judge be costs in the plaintiff's
action and that the respondents pay the appellant's
costs of the appeal.
<P>

22   	In order to accommodate the fact that a successful appeal
may be brought against my decision, I consider that the order should
be
tailored so that the costs are not payable until after the Court of Appeal has
disposed of the matter and, therefore, any variation
in the orders for costs I
have made will not be defeated by a prior payment.
<P>

23   	I order:-
<P>

1.	that the appellant have leave to have the costs of the application before
Master Harrison and of the appeal before me assessed
and/or taxed forthwith;
and
<P>

2.	the respondents pay such costs forthwith upon such assessment or taxation,
provided that should the respondents seek leave to
appeal from my decision of 2
December 1999, such costs shall not be payable until either:-
<P>

(a)	leave to appeal is refused; or
<P>

(b)	if leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is dismissed; or
<P>

(c)	if leave to appeal is granted; there is no variation to the cost order I
have made.
