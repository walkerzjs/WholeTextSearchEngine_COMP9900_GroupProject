<b><u>70002/97  -  REGINA  v  MICHAEL PATSALIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70200/97  -  REGINA  v  ALEXIOS SPATHIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT  (Withdrawal of Blue Tracksuit Pants (Exhibit AA) from List of
Exhibits (ref page 790 transcript)  [No. 6]</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   In this matter the Crown tendered a pair of
blue tracksuit trousers which were recovered from the bedroom of Mr Alex
Spathis, the
accused, that being the rear bedroom identified as bedroom number
1 at premises 18 St Paul Street Randwick.  At the time the tracksuit
trousers
were tendered they had been identified by Constable Young as having been
located within that bedroom, draped over an ironing
board. They appear in
certain photographs which form part of exhibit L which have been distributed to
the jury.
<P>

2  	At the time of the tender there was no objection to the tender by
either Mr Macgregor QC, on behalf of Mr Patsalis, or Mr Campbell.
 They were
admitted as Exhibit AA in the case against both accused.  However, Mr
Macgregor, some time shortly thereafter, did raise
a difficulty in respect of
them.  The basis upon which they are tendered by the Crown is that Mr Patsalis,
in the course of his interview,
said that, having discarded his own clothing at
Chester Hill, he was provided by Mr Spathis with a top and tracksuit pants.
The tracksuit
pants he described as blue and made of a fleecy lined material,
as opposed to some parachute material.
<P>

3  	The tracksuit trousers found at the premises of Mr Spathis fit
that general description.  They were also damp, and that fact
is relied upon by
the Crown, it being suggested that they had been washed, like a jacket which Mr
Spathis acknowledged he had worn
the evening before and which had been
laundered in order to remove the smell of smoke.
<P>

4  	Mr Spathis, in his interview, gave an account of the tracksuit
trousers.  He initially retrieved them from Mr Patsalis at Mr
Patsalis' home in
Homebush.  However, according to his interview, he later noticed that they were
singed and therefore discarded
them in Earlwood along with other items,
including the blue tarpaulin.
<P>

5  	The reception of the tracksuit trousers into evidence could be
justified on the basis of relevance, having regard to the material
which I have
recited.  Nonetheless, they do seem to me to have the potential of mischief so
far as Mr Spathis is concerned in view
of the account he has given. More than
that, their probative value is slight in my view.  There were apparently,
within the same
room, other pairs of tracksuit trousers, and they are
undistinctive in their appearance.
<P>

6  	The danger from the perspective of Mr Spathis is that whatever
probative value they may have is outweighed by the prejudice
that could arise
through the jury inferring that he had lied in respect of his explanation of
having discarded the tracksuit trousers.
 The trousers were not submitted to
forensic analysis and, beyond their description, there is nothing to link them
with the events
of the evening of the 11th April.  The Crown does not suggest
that it would be making a submission that Mr Spathis did lie in respect
of
these trousers.
<P>

7  	In that circumstance I believe that it is appropriate, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, to determine that the probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial
to a
party.
<P>

8  	Having said that, the matter has gone before the jury, and indeed
the trousers have been inspected by the jury during one of
the adjournments.
The whole of the Crown case is not in.  Other witnesses may be called who may
throw greater light upon this issue,
although that is not immediately apparent
from the material which has been served by the Crown.  Nonetheless it seems to
me that,
if they are to be withdrawn, that should occur at the end of the Crown
case.
<P>

9  	For that reason, unless something else arises, I would propose
that the tracksuit (Exhibit AA) should be withdrawn, notwithstanding
its
earlier admission without objection, on the basis that I have identified.
Further, the photograph of the trousers taken during
the search (which forms
part of exhibit L, photograph number 67), should likewise be withdrawn, and an
indication given that the
Crown does not rely upon that photograph.
