<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>TUESDAY 1 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1865/99 - HORWATH CORPORATE PTY LTD V JACQUELINE HUIE </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:    </b>This is another stage of the litigation that has arisen
out of a failure of the Astor Goldsbrough Trust.  In simple terms that trust
involved the present plaintiff, as trustee by itself, and a manager
administering a scheme whereby owners of home units in the Astor
Goldsbrough
building would pool their units so that they could be operated as a hotel.
Unfortunately, the moneys generated by the
scheme were insufficient to keep it
going and it has ceased trading.  The trust deed does not explicitly deal with
the situation
as to what was to occur if losses were made in trading.
<P>

2	Clause 23 of the trust deed reads as follows:
<P>

"23  Termination
<P>

<b>Procedure</b>
<P>

23.1 On termination, the Trustee must realise the Assets of that Trust.  That
must be completed in 180 days if practical and in
any event as soon as possible
after that.
<P>

<b>Final Distribution</b>
<P>

23.2  The net proceeds of realisation, after discharging or providing for all
Liabilities of the Trust and meeting the expenses
of termination, must be
distributed pro rata to Participants according to the number of Units they
hold.
<P>

<b>Set off</b>
<P>

23.3  The Trustee may apply any distribution payable under this clause 23
against amounts owing by the Participant under clause
12."
<P>

3	On 20 April 1999, virtually by consent, I ordered and declared that:
<P>

"1.  The Trustee is now required to wind up the Astor Goldsbrough Trust ("the
Trust") and that upon completion of winding up the
Trust be terminated."
<P>

4	I then advised the trustee that it would be justified in taking certain steps
to wind up the trust.  These involved:
<P>

"(d) collecting the receivables of the Trust and realising any other assets of
the Trust; and
<P>

(e) approaching the Court, if necessary, for further directions when the assets
of the Trust have been realised."
<P>

5	I noted that various issues were postponed, including what was the date of
the winding up of the trust, whether an order should
be made for winding up
under either s 583 or s 1074 of the Corporations Law, and if there is to be a
court winding up who should
be the liquidator.
<P>

6	The motion filed today was that the court appoint from the A List of
liquidators an independent liquidator to wind up the affairs
of the trust under
the direction of the court.
<P>

7	There has been debate about what this really means.
<P>

8	There has not been the opportunity to research the point completely, but it
would seem to me at this stage that if the court is
to wind up the trust, like
it would wind up a partnership, it can only do so in proceedings in which all
of the quasi partners (in
other words the unitholders of the trust) are
parties; see<b> Van Sandau v Moore</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1826/1134.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1826] EngR 1134</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281826%29%201%20Russ%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1826) 1 Russ 441</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=38%20ER%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">38 ER 171.</a>  I should
note the present defendant is in these proceedings as a representative
contradictor, but she does not necessarily represent
all unitholders.
<P>

9	Accordingly, I cannot at this stage have a winding up akin to a winding up of
a partnership.
<P>

10	There is doubt as to whether the court can direct a winding up akin to the
winding up of a company, at least outside the scope
of s 583 of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

11	I should make it clear that I am not dealing today with any rights that may
exist under that section or s 1074, but merely on
general equitable
principles.
<P>

12	There is a sentence in the 3rd edition of McPherson on<b> The Law of Company
Liquidation</b> (Law Book Co, Sydney, 1987) p 2 that:
<P>

"Liquidation ... can take place only pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the relevant statute."
<P>

13	Although one can argue with this proposition, logically it does seem to
accord both with the historical practice of Courts of
Equity and with the
authorities such as they are.
<P>

14	In any event, there is a very real distinction between a corporation and a
trust, in that with a corporation the property is
vested in the corporation
itself, but with a trust the property and the prima facie liability for the
debts is vested in the trustee.
<P>

15	There does not appear to be any reported case before the English Joint Stock
Companies Winding Up Act 1844, when many companies
adopted the structure of a
deed of settlement with the property held by trustees, where there was a
winding up of the enterprise
by the court.  However, it may be that more
extensive research will find some, or it may be the answer was that because of
the rule
that all the "shareholders" should be parties it was just impractical
to bring such proceedings.
<P>

16	One must also focus on what a winding up really is. Traditionally it has
been described by saying that it is the process of turning
the horse around and
leading him back to the stable; that is, that the corporation, figured by the
horse, makes its way out of the
stable, goes about its business, at the moment
of winding up the horse turns around and starts moving back towards the stable.
Thus
the horse is still there, it is the same animal, it has got the same
burdens, but it gradually releases its burdens until the moment
of dissolution
when it gets put back in the stable and dies.  Thus winding up or liquidation
is a process whereby assets are realised,
claims are assessed and the assets
cease to be assets of the corporation, the claims are satisfied, as much as
they can be, and then
the company dies.
<P>

17	Putting that concept into the realm of trust law is rather difficult.  As
Grbich and others say in<b> Winding Up Trusts (</b>CCH, Sydney, 1984) at pp 28
and following, it is very difficult indeed to release the equitable obligations
and fiduciary duties that
flow between trustees and beneficiaries, and to a
more limited extent in the reverse direction.  It is not feasible just to say
that
a trust comes to an end.  One has not only got to deal with the assets and
liabilities, one has also got to consider what is to happen
to the equitable
obligations.
<P>

18	Thus when looking at the word "termination" in cl 23.1 of the trust deed
there is a lot to be said for the proposition that the
word merely means that
the business of the trust is to terminate.  It cannot mean that the equitable
obligation of trustee to beneficiaries,
or beneficiaries to trustee ceases.  In
fact the opposite must be the case.  The trustee in realising the assets will
have expended
money.  There will be some implied right, at least prima facie,
for the money to be reimbursed, which there would not be if the trust
as a
whole had come to an end.
<P>

19	There may be an argument cl 23 sets up some secondary trust or contractual
relationship, but it is more likely the trust continues.
 So the winding up is
really a mechanical process which has to be gone through as a matter of
practicality in order to fulfil the
aim of the deed, where the deed in itself
is silent.  It is really just another instance of the court in its implied
powers applying
a sort of cy pres scheme of management in order to fulfil the
trust.
<P>

20	Under the deed the trustee is given the obligation to realise the assets.
The authorities suggest that where a particular person
is vested with
obligations of this nature that prima facie the parties should be left to their
bargain.  Accordingly, as Erskine
LC said in<b> Middleton v Dodswell</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1806/376.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1806] EngR 376</a>; (1806)
13 Ves Jun 266;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=33%20ER%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">33 ER 294</a>, the court is more reluctant to take the
administration of a trust out of the hands of an executor who has become a
trustee, as opposed
to an administrator of an estate, who has become a trustee,
because in the first case particular confidence was reposed in the nominated
executor.
<P>

21	So here the trustee in the deed is a person in whom particular confidence
was placed.  The applicant says that she and many of
her colleagues as
unitholders have lost confidence in the trustee.  However, the loss of
confidence does not seem, at least at this
stage, to amount to allegations of
breach of trust and there is insufficient, it seems to me, to cast aside the
nominated trustee
in favour of somebody else.
<P>

22	Under the order that was already made the trustee envisages coming back to
the court after the assets have been realised.  Today
its counsel proffered an
undertaking to the court that it would not distribute, except in accordance
with permission already granted
by the court, or upon further direction of the
court, with a couple of qualifications.
<P>

23	It seems to me that that is a fair protection.  This is because what appear
to me at this stage to be the thorny problems are
the liability, if any, of the
beneficiaries to the creditors;  the liability of the trustee to the creditors;
and the question of
the lien of the trustee.  Those matters can be dealt with
by the court in specific litigation with the appropriate parties or
representative
parties once it is seen, at least prima facie, what is the fund
that is left to be split between the various disputants.
<P>

24	I have said on previous occasions that trusts are the creatures of equity
and that rights and duties exist because of the orders
that an Equity Court may
make, and so  essentially all trusts are under the supervision of the court
(see for instance<b> McLean v Burns Philp Trustee Co Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20623" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR
623</a>, 637).  However, as also appears from <b>McLean's</b> <b>case</b>, the
court is guided by practice and precedent of the past and lets the trust run on
in accordance with the trust deed, at least
up until a certain point is
reached.  If that point is reached, then any beneficiary who complains is
entitled, almost as of course,
to an order for the specific performance of some
obligation under the trust or for general administration, though usually, prima
facie, at first instance at his or her own cost.
<P>

25	Accordingly, the present application is competent to have the trust
administered under the jurisdiction of the court, or alternatively
for some
specific order to be made as to its administration.
<P>

26	There are two main matters to consider:  (a) have the circumstances in the
present case been made out that would justify an order?
 and (b) what are the
discretionary considerations as to whether the order should be made?
<P>

27	As to (a) I do not consider the evidence at this stage is sufficient to
displace the provisions of clause 23.1 of the deed entitling
the trustee at
least to realise the assets and then to administer and distribute under the
direction of the court.  Indeed, the undertaking
as to the second really
achieves a lot of what the applicant is seeking.
<P>

28	As to (b), the cost of imposing an A List liquidator at probably some $350
per hour, as a supervisor, would not at this stage
seem to be money well spent.
If there were some particular matters that needed supervision, then things may
be different, but even
then it would seem less expensive to direct that the
trustee not do certain things except with the leave of the court, as opposed
to
putting in a liquidator as a supervisor.
<P>

29	It does not appear at this stage that this is a case where it is necessary
for a skilled insolvency practitioner to go through
the books and records of
the trustee and the manager.  If later in this litigation that appears to be
the situation, I may then take
some other direction.
<P>

30	Accordingly, I am not prepared at this stage to appoint an A List liquidator
either as liquidator or supervisor or to put the
trust under the administration
of the court.
<P>

31	I have given these reasons as an ex tempore judgment. It would be of value
for future generations to have gone into these questions
thoroughly, but it
seemed to be better just to give the result of the case because the greater
probability will be that many of these
issues will have to be thoroughly argued
at a later stage of the litigation.  It is far better if a full judgment has to
be delivered,
it is delivered after full argument from counsel.
<P>

32	I dismiss the notice of motion of 1 June 1999 without prejudice for a
similar motion to be filed should circumstances alter.
<P>

(Mr Gleeson sought that the costs of the plaintiff of the notice of motion of 1
June be paid out of the trust fund)
<P>

33	The costs of the trustees are to be paid out of the fund on the trustee
basis.  I reserve the costs of the applicant.
<P>

34	I stand the proceedings over to 9.50 am on 20 July to my list.  I order that
exhibits PX01, PX02 and DX03 be returned.
<P>
