MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 26 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<u>20182/1998</u>	<u>JOERG GUENTER MARTIN MOHRWINKEL v COMMONWEALTH OF
AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff has been an employee of the Commonwealth of
Australia (the defendant).  There were two periods of employment.
 Firstly, he
was employed between 1961 and 1968.  Secondly, he was employed between 1969 and
1989.  During the course of his employment,
he was regularly exposed to the
noise of printers and presses which were extremely noisy.  For many years, he
has suffered from industrial
deafness.  He first noticed that he was suffering
from hearing loss in 1985.
<P>

2  	It was then that his ears started having ringing noises.  At the
time, this was not a major concern to him.
<P>

3  	The ringing noises gradually got worse.  By 1986/1987 he was
suffering difficulties in certain situations.  In 1987, the defendant
caused
some testing to be done and it was found that the plaintiff had suffered a
noise induced hearing loss.  Since that time, the
ringing in his ears has
continued to get worse and has become extremely annoying.  There has been a
continuing deterioration in his
hearing.
<P>

4  	There is evidence that the plaintiff did not suffer from hearing
difficulties at the time of the commencement of his employment.
 Apart from the
testing in 1987, there has been no testing carried out by the defendant of the
plaintiff's hearing.  During his employment,
he was not provided with any
protection.  He was not provided with any safety lectures.
<P>

5  	In 1993, he responded to an advertisement placed by a Solicitor.
On 23 August 1993, certain consultations took place.  The plaintiff
consulted
with Mr Keck (industrial audiologist), Mr Krikunov (solicitor) and a barrister.
It was then that he first received advice
that the defendant had been negligent
("in that they had failed to provide me with proper hearing protection and
failed to regularly
test my hearing and give me the results of those tests and
had failed by engineering means to reduce the noise that I was exposed
to").
<P>

6  	In 1994, he commenced proceedings in the District Court.  In
those proceedings, he propounded a claim for damages arising out
of personal
injury.  The claim was founded on negligence.  The proceedings were removed
into this Court in 1998 (because of jurisdictional
reasons).
<P>

7  	The explanation for the delay between 1993 and 1998 is to be
found in affidavit material provided by Mr Akerman (the present
solicitor for
the plaintiff).  The delay is not the subject of any complaint made by the
defendant.  Indeed, it is not delay for
which the plaintiff can be held
responsible.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff seeks extension of the relevant limitation period.
The hearing of this application took place on 20 July 1999.
<P>

9  	The proceedings were originally brought against two defendants.
The Commonwealth of Australia is now the only defendant.  It
opposes the
application.
<P>

10  	On behalf of the plaintiff, a number of affidavits have been
read.  The plaintiff has been briefly cross-examined.  He has
tendered
documentation.  The defendant has not adduced any affidavit material or other
documentation.
<P>

11  	The application is made pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/la1985133/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 36</a> (2) of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/consol_act/la1985133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u> 1985</a> of the Australian Capital Territory.  This provision
enables the Court to extend the relevant limitation period where it decides
that it is just and reasonable so to do.  It is a discretionary power.  In
exercising the power, the Court is required to have regard
to all the
circumstances of the case including those enumerated in subsection (3).  The
plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the
Court that an order should be
made.
<P>

12  	The opposition to the application is of limited nature.  There
is a general submission to the effect that the Court should
not decide that it
is just and reasonable to make an order on the basis that the relevant onus has
not been discharged.  I shall
briefly refer to some of the other matters that
were agitated.  The defendant submits that there is a lack of satisfactory
explanation
for the period that elapsed between 1987 and 1993.  There was a
contention of the suffering of general prejudice.  It is said that
there cannot
now be a fair trial because there have been at least three other employers of
the plaintiff.
<P>

13  	The period between 1987 and 1993 is not the subject of detailed
explanation.  The substance of the explanation lies in the
insidious nature of
the plaintiff's condition itself.  It creeps up on the person suffering from
it.  This is evidenced by the expert
material placed before the Court.  The
plaintiff's position seems to be that there was a continuing deterioration and
that by about
1993 the stage had been reached where there was an appreciation
that action was necessary.  It was then that he responded to the
advertisement
and obtained advice which led to the commencement of proceedings.  Whilst it
may be said that further amplification
could have been helpful, the material
that has been offered just manages to suffice in the circumstances of this
case.
<P>

14  	The plaintiff has been employed by others.  There is evidence to
suggest that this employment may not be of any real significance
in relation to
the suffering of his condition.  If any of this employment has some materiality
to his condition, it seems to me that
any such problem can be fairly dealt with
at trial.
<P>

15  	There is no evidence of specific prejudice.  The defendant
alleges the suffering of general prejudice only.  It is not in dispute,
that
the defendant retains all relevant documentation.  The delay is significant.
Delay of itself may give rise to prejudice.  The
cases speak of presumptive
prejudice.  I take such prejudice into account.
<P>

16  	I have had regard to the matters agitated by the defendant.
However, it seems to me that this is a case where, a fair trial
can still take
place.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff has what may be regarded as a serious injury.  It
is not treatable and can be expected to deteriorate.  It is
not said that he
does not have an arguable case which may be productive of substantial
damages.
<P>

18  	I am satisfied that the relevant onus has been discharged.  In
all of the circumstances of this case I have reached the decision
that it is
just and reasonable to make an order and that an order  should be made.
<P>

19  	I order that the period within which an action on the
plaintiff's cause of action may be brought be extended up to and including
25
July 1994.  The costs of the application are to be costs in the cause.  The
exhibit may be returned.
