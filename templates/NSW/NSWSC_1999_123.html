<b>JUDGMENT (On form of questions to be answered by the jury)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   One of the preliminary matters that arose this morning
concerned the form of the questions to be answered by the
jury. Various drafts
of the form of the questions have been provided by counsel for the plaintiff
and comments have been made by
counsel for the defendant on such drafts and
upon the draft that I faxed to the parties on Friday.
<P>

2	The matter can be focused by reference, for example, to the Second Further
Amended Statement of Claim in the second action in
which the plaintiff in
paragraph 4 pleads that the relevant publication gave rise to the following
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"(a)(i) The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old boys
having deliberately refrained from asking those boys how old
they were; </i>
<P>

<i>	or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii) the plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old
boys."</i>
<P>

3	The draft of the questions prepared by myself was in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>"Has the plaintiff established the second program conveyed to the ordinary
reasonable viewer any of the following imputations"</i>
<P>

4	and there is set out (a) <u>or</u> (b).
<P>

5	In relation to the second of those two imputations two words have been used:
One, it is a "fall-back" imputation and it is <i>"an alternative</i>"
imputation.
<P>

6	It was contended for the plaintiff that the questions to the jury should
include a specific note to the effect, for example, that
imputation (b) is
intended to be an alternative for imputation (a), you should consider
imputation (b) only if you have answered
no to imputation (a).
<P>

7	For the defendant it is contended that no such specific note is required when
the nature of the issue to be decided by the jury
is properly understood.
<P>

8	To seek to gain the proper understanding one has to have recourse to a series
of decisions of Hunt J, principally two decisions
of His Honour, the first
dated 12 August 1988, and the second of 26 August 1988 in the matter of<b>
<i>Carson v Slee &amp; Anor</i></b> to which decisions His Honour writing
elsewhere ("<i>Aspects of the Law of Defamation in New South Wales</i>", editor
J Gibson, p 12) directs attention to understand what he means by the pleading
of a "<i>fall-back"</i> imputation.
<P>

9	It seems clear to me on reading what his Honour said in relation to the
imputations in question in that case and what His Honour
in fact ruled on 26
August 1988, that in relation to "<i>fall-back" </i>imputation being the second
of two he ruled that  it would go to the jury "<i>as an alternative to
imputation (a)."</i>
<P>

10	At the first trial of<b> <i>Carson v Slee,</i></b> presided over by Loveday
J, the jury was directed by His Honour in relation to the alternative
imputation in the following way, and
I am grateful to Mr Reynolds S.C. for
providing to me page 5 of the transcript of his Honour's summing up, His Honour
said:
<P>

	<i>"It is only if you should answer 1(a) in relation to the article of 6 May
1988 that it is necessary for you to go on to consider 1(b)."</i>
<P>

11	The position taken by the defendant is that such an approach really does not
represent the reality of that which confronts the
jury, which is a choice. The
jury will decide whether or not it means (a) or (b). They will consider both
and decide one. The formulation
of the note compels consideration of the first
first rather than the consideration of both.
<P>

12	The framework of the suggested note and the wording of what His Honour said
to the jury in<b> <i>Carson</i></b> to my mind reflects the ultimate outcome of
the jury having made a choice between one or other of the two imputations.
Obviously
if they decide one they will not decide the other. But the jury
should not be precluded from considering both. I do not read the
note, the
direction given by His Honour, in such a way as to compel consideration of
first the first and then the second. It will
be for the jury to decide which,
if either, the matter complained of in fact conveys.
<P>

13	Thus I do not propose to incorporate into the written form of the questions
the note to which reference is made in the drafts
supplied by counsel for the
plaintiff.
<P>

14	It seems to me that a fall-back imputation when one considers its history as
referred to in<b> <i>Carson</i></b> and other decisions of His Honour, for
example<b> <i>Anderson v Mirror Newspapers</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20735" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 735</a> and His
Honour's unreported decision in <b><i>Elphick v John Fairfax</i></b> of 25 June
1988, that the fall-back imputation legitimately can be pleaded and properly
can be left to the jury was one that differs
in its seriousness from the other
imputation relied upon. The choice however remains that for the jury; it should
not be constrained
by a direction as to how they exercise it but rather by
general directions in the summing up that one or other is available and it
is a
matter for the jury to decide.
<P>

15	In that sense I do not disagree with the submission put by Mr Nicholas that
to that extent the imputations, all of them, are
there before the jury, which
if any they choose to find as having been conveyed will be a matter for
them.
<P>

16	Thus I will have handed down to counsel the final form of the questions in
which I will note matters hitherto noted that the
word "<i>convey</i>" has been
substituted for "<i>carried</i>" and the word "<i>or</i>" has been inserted in
the sets of questions where, conformably with the pleading, the imputations
have been pleaded in the alternative.
