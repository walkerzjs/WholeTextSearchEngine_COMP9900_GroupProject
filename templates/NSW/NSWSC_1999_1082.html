<b><u>020143/95 - BT as Administratrix of the Estate of the Late AT &amp; Anor
v Oei</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:</b>     These proceedings were commenced
pursuant to an order made by Ireland J on 24 February 1995 permitting the
plaintiffs to be identified
by the pseudonyms "AT" and "BT".  AT died on 26
February 1995.  Thereafter BT, in her capacity as administratrix of the estate
of
AT, continued the proceedings both on her own behalf and on behalf of the
estate of AT.
<P>

2   	The defendant is a medical practitioner in general practice
in the inner city of Sydney. AT was his patient. The two claims
seek damages
for personal injuries arising out of the defendant's alleged negligent failure
to diagnose AT's HIV illness and to counsel
him (adequately or at all) to
undergo an HIV antibody test. It is contended that a general practitioner, in
practice in Sydney in
1992, exercising ordinary care and skill would have
identified that AT was at risk of having contracted HIV in the light of his
history
and symptoms.  In the event, AT did prove to be HIV positive.  BT who
was living with AT as his de facto wife (they subsequently
married) also
contracted HIV.
<P>

3   	The claim made on behalf of the estate of AT is for general
damages for psychiatric injury and/or nervous shock suffered by
AT upon
learning that he had infected his wife with HIV. It is common ground that the
defendant owed a duty of care to his patient,
AT.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff's personal claim requires consideration of
whether the defendant, in addition to the duty to his patient, also
owed a duty
of care to her as his patient's sexual partner.
<P>

<b>Factual Background</b>
<P>

<b>The Consultations </b>
<P>

5   	AT consulted the defendant for the first time on 26
November 1991. He was complaining of a sore throat, fever and a cough.
 The
defendant obtained a history that AT did not suffer from allergies. He was a
separated man working as a building contractor
who described himself as a
non-smoker and social drinker.  On examination, the defendant observed
lymphadenopathy (swollen glands).
 He made a provisional diagnosis of viral
laryngotrachitis and pharyngitis.
<P>

6   	AT next saw the defendant on 28 January 1992.  He
complained of fever, urinary symptoms, bilateral abdominal pain and lethargy.
The defendant observed that AT had a coated tongue, lymphadenopathy,
generalised tenderness of the abdomen with a palpable hepatomegaly.
He made a
provisional diagnosis of appendicitis or Hepatitis and arranged for AT to
undergo a range of tests including a full blood
count, liver function test and
Hepatitis screen. AT was advised to return the following day.
<P>

7   	On 29 January 1992, AT returned for a further consultation
as directed. He was still unwell and feverish.  By that time the
defendant had
the results of a test which confirmed a provisional diagnosis of urinary tract
infection.  The defendant prescribed
Augmentin Forte and instructed AT to
return when the results of the other tests were available.  
<P>

8   	AT next saw the defendant on 1 February 1992.  He
complained of feeling very tired and depressed.  The liver function test
was
suggestive of Hepatitis B.  The defendant considered that the combination of
Hepatitis B and a urinary tract infection was unusual.
It was unusual for a
male to develop a urinary tract infection. In evidence the defendant said that
urinary tract infections in males
may be associated with anal intercourse.
During this consultation the defendant questioned AT about his sexual
activities; whether
he was homosexual or bisexual or had numerous sexual
partners. He also asked if AT was an intravenous drug user.  AT denied any
history
in this regard but he referred to "casual exploits" as a possible
source of the Hepatitis B infection. 
<P>

9   	The defendant says that at the consultation of 1 February
he told AT that the Hepatitis B infection could have been acquired
as the
result of an unprotected sexual encounter and he gave AT three pamphlets, two
concerning Hepatitis B and a third relating
to safe sex practices, and
counselled him in relation to safe sex practices. He recalled AT brushing this
off with the comment that
he would have "no energy for it".   
<P>

10   	The consultation on 1 February 1992 concluded with the
defendant advising AT to rest.  He gave him a medical certificate for
one week.
He ordered further tests and advised AT to return in due course to obtain the
result of them.
<P>

11   	The defendant next saw AT on 10 February 1992 when AT said
that he was feeling a little better.  A test result suggested the
presence of a
phlebolith (kidney stone).  AT was concerned about the phlebolith and requested
referral for its removal.  The defendant
was of the view that it was not a
matter for concern and so advised AT.  He recommended further rest and
instructed AT to return
for review in two weeks time.  
<P>

12   	AT returned on 4 March 1992.  On this occasion AT reported
that he had been feverish and suffering chills, aches and pains.
 He was given
a medical certificate for two weeks and asked to return for further review.  He
did so on 19 March 1992.  On that occasion
he indicated that he was feeling
much better.  The defendant ordered a repeat full blood count, liver function
test and other tests.
 
<P>

13   	AT next saw the defendant on 1 December 1992.  On this
occasion he again presented complaining of fever and aches and pains.
 He
described himself as being very irritable and suffering from a mild headache.
The defendant made a provisional diagnosis of viral
illness.  He ordered a full
blood count and further tests. 
<P>

14   	The defendant next saw AT on 15 January 1993 when he was
complaining of bilateral ringing of the ears, feeling unwell with
left sided
abdominal pain and constipation.  The defendant carried out a physical
examination which revealed abdominal tenderness
and bilateral ear wax.  On this
occasion he arranged for AT to undergo a barium enema. 
<P>

15   	AT returned to see the defendant on 22 January 1993 and
reported that he was feeling a little better. He had undergone a barium
enema
in the meantime and the results of that procedure revealed spleenomegaly.  He
was referred for a CAT scan to investigate this
more fully.  On 30 January 1993
he again saw the defendant.  The CAT scan result revealed heptospleenomegaly
suggestive of cirrhosis
of the liver.  The defendant considered that AT
required further investigation and referred him to Dr Bill Bye,
Gastroenterologist,
for further management.  This was the last occasion on
which the defendant saw AT. 
<P>

<b>The relationship between AT and BT</b>
<P>

16   	BT met AT around March 1992.  It appears that their
introduction arose in consequence of one or other of them placing an
advertisement
in a newspaper.  AT collected BT from her home and they went to a
nearby coffee shop.  They chatted for more than an hour.  In the
course of this
initial discussion AT disclosed that he had contracted Hepatitis B.  He told BT
that he was better now and that he
did not require medication.  It was
necessary for him to drink a lot of fluid and rest.  He also disclosed that,
following his separation
from his first wife, he had visited a brothel in
company with a friend.  He said he had had sexual relations with a young Thai
girl
who was an illegal immigrant.  Following the discussion in the coffee shop
the two went to a park and talked further.  They spoke
about the reasons for
the breakdown of AT's marriage.  
<P>

17   	At the initial meeting AT and BT arranged to meet again.
Thereafter there were a number of outings.  AT would call to BT's
home and
escort her out to dinner or a club.  He took her home on each occasion.  There
were no sexual relations between the two.
 On one occasion AT attended a
barbecue at BT's home.  
<P>

18   	Following the barbecue AT called on BT and told her that
he had decided he did not wish to continue seeing her.  He explained
that he
did not believe he could manage a relationship with a woman who had a young
child.  BT was the mother of a son then aged
about six or seven years.
However, despite this hesitation, AT subsequently arranged to take BT out
again. 
<P>

19   	At Easter 1992, AT and BT went on a holiday to Young.   On
the first day of that trip BT asked AT how he was feeling.  He
told her that he
was tired and that he had had a slight fever that day.  The following day for
the first time the two had sexual
intercourse.  BT said that they had used a
condom on this occasion because AT expressed concerns about her becoming
pregnant.  
<P>

20   	In June 1992, BT started working in the food services
department of a hospital.  Between Easter and June of 1992, when she
commenced
employment with the hospital, the two had sexual intercourse on about three or
four occasions.  On those occasions they
did not use a condom.  BT had received
a prescription for a contraceptive pill in February of 1992.  At that time she
was suffering
menstrual problems and the prescription of the pill was
apparently to settle these difficulties and not for contraceptive purposes.

<P>

21   	On 9 June 1992, BT consulted her doctor, Dr Subbamma.
During that consultation it appears that she told Dr Subbamma that her
partner
had Hepatitis B.  Dr Subbamma noted:  "Wishes to have Hep B test (partner has
Hep B)".  BT saw Dr Subbamma on a number of
occasions in June and July of 1992.
Dr Subbamma advised BT to undergo a course of vaccinations to immunise her
against Hepatitis
B. BT underwent a course of vaccinations between 7 July 1992
and 21 January 1993.  BT was advised that she and AT should use condoms
until
she had completed the full course.
<P>

22   	In September 1992, BT and AT commenced living together as
de facto partners.  It appears clear that on occasions, both before
and after
September 1992, the couple had unprotected sexual intercourse.  
<P>

23   	On an occasion BT accompanied AT when he saw the defendant
at his rooms. BT remained throughout the consultation. AT was complaining
of a
sensation of ringing in the ears. She was present while the defendant syringed
AT's ears. It was BT's recollection that that
consultation occurred on an
occasion prior to AT's trip to Japan which took place in December 1992 (T.170).
In cross-examination
she agreed that the only complaint so far as she was aware
that AT made to the defendant was about ringing in his ears on this occasion
but she went on to say "but got some more problems like stomach pain" (T.160).
The defendant's notes show only one occasion when
AT presented complaining of
ringing in the ears.  This was on 15 January 1993.  He also complained of left
sided abdominal pain/constipation
on that occasion.  I consider that BT was
mistaken in her recollection that the consultation took place prior to AT's
trip to Japan
in December 1992.  I find that she was present with AT at his
consultation with the defendant on 15 January 1993.
<P>

24   	In February 1993, BT became ill.  She had a very severe
headache and was not able to move her jaw freely.  Her arms and legs
were very
weak.  She had a high temperature and watery eyes and her throat was very sore.
She was unable to eat. She attended Dr
Salgo on 22 February 1993. She
complained of fever and sore throat for a few days.  On examination Dr Salgo
noted she was very febrile.
 He queried whether she may have tonsillitis.  He
prescribed amoxicillin, paracetamol and fluids.  For the reasons set out below
it is probable that this was BT's seroconversion illness. In that light of that
finding, and having regard to the expert evidence
as to the interval between
infection and the onset of a seroconversion illness (outlined at para 149
below) I consider that BT contracted
HIV on or after 21 January 1993.   
<P>

25   	In January 1994, AT and BT quarrelled.  They separated for
a time following this quarrel.  On 15 February 1994, BT consulted
Dr Subbamma.
At that time she was upset and weepy and spoke of her separation from AT.  Dr
Subbamma arranged for blood tests including
an HIV antibody test.
<P>

26   	On or about 8 March 1994, BT was advised that her HIV test
was antibody positive.  She was referred for counselling to the
Albion Street
Clinic.  She followed up on this referral. 
<P>

27   	BT attributed her HIV positive status to sexual contact
with AT.  The couple had planned to marry in April 1994.  When BT
learned that
she had contracted the disease she did not inform AT.  She was concerned that
he might not marry her if he was aware
that she had HIV.  She was worried about
her own financial security and that of her son.  She blamed AT for placing her
in the predicament
in which she found herself.  
<P>

28   	In October 1994 it appears that Dr Koorey, a specialist
who was then treating AT for his liver condition,  arranged for him
to undergo
an HIV test.  On 24 November 1994, AT was diagnosed as HIV positive. 
<P>

29   	On learning of his positive status, AT expressed concern
for his wife and suggested that she go to the hospital to undergo
a test
herself.  She said she did not wish to be tested at the hospital because she
had worked there.  It appears that thereafter
AT took her to see Dr Salgo and a
further HIV test was conducted.  On 9 January 1995, BT was informed by Dr Salgo
that she was HIV
positive.  At no time did she tell either AT or Dr Salgo that
she had already been made aware of her HIV positive status. 
<P>

30   	AT was admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in
February of 1995 for a liver transplant. He died on 26 February 1995 of
liver
failure. He did not die in consequence of HIV or AIDS.
<P>

<b>AT's Evidence</b>
<P>

31   	Evidence was taken from AT before a court-appointed
examiner, Mr Tobin QC on 24 February 1995. In those proceedings he adhered
to
the contents of an affidavit which he had sworn the previous evening. In the
affidavit AT stated that at no time during his treatment
by the defendant was
he informed that Hepatitis B was something which he might transmit to others
through unprotected sexual intercourse.
 He said that he was given no
information regarding any risks that he posed to others in that regard. He said
that at no time during
his treatment by the defendant was he advised to have an
HIV antibody test.
<P>

32   	Objection was taken at trial to the reception of the
evidence of AT.  I determined to admit the evidence and gave my reasons
during
the course of the hearing. It is appropriate in these reasons to set out
something of the history of the evidence given by
AT. 
<P>

33   	The affidavit sworn by AT was prepared by his solicitor,
Mr Hirsch.  Mr Hirsch first took instructions from AT on 23 January
1995 at a
time when AT appeared to be in relatively good health.  On the night of 22
February 1995 Mr Hirsch was advised by BT of
AT's admission to hospital.
Around 5 pm on 23 February 1995 Mr Hirsch spoke with Dr Adelstein and was
advised that AT was in renal
failure with a life expectancy of 24 to 48 hours,
72 at the most.  Mr Hirsch proceeded to prepare the affidavit for execution by
AT.
<P>

34   	Dr Adelstein, Staff Specialist in Clinical Immunology at
the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, said that as at 23 February 1995
AT was in
renal failure. At about 10am on 24 February 1995 he observed signs of
encephalopathy.  This is a state of impairment of
brain function associated
with liver failure. It is usually accompanied by confusion. 
<P>

35   	Dr Adelstein was present at 1 pm on 24 February 1995 when
evidence was taken from AT before Mr Tobin. He was surprised that
AT was able
to sit up and communicate during the course of that short hearing. Generally,
Dr Adelstein agreed with the observation
that AT was "lucid but at great
effort" during the course of the proceedings. 
<P>

36   	There are some matters of chronology in the account set
out in AT's affidavit which appear plainly wrong.  Thus, AT asserts
that he met
BT during 1993 after he had seen the defendant for the last time.  It is BT's
evidence that they met in March 1992 and
there is other material tending
strongly to support the view that they had met not later than June 1992.  AT
asserted that his first
consultation with the defendant took place in January
1992 whereas the defendant's clinical notes show it took place in November
of
the previous year. 
<P>

37   	AT's evidence was untested and having regard to his state
of health at the time of executing the affidavit it seems to me
that relatively
little weight can be placed on it. 
<P>

<b>Safe Sex Advice at the 1 February Consultation</b>
<P>

38   	As noted in paragraph 31 above, AT denied that he had
received any advice concerning safe sex practices in the course of his
treatment with the defendant.  It was the defendant's evidence that he had
supplied AT with three pamphlets concerning Hepatitis
B and safe sex at the
consultation on 1 February 1992. The defendant attached copies of the three
pamphlets to a statement, made
for the purpose of these proceedings, in July
1995.  That statement and the copies of the pamphlets became Exhibit V in the
proceedings.
 In evidence the defendant sought to correct one matter. The
pamphlet marked "B" forming part of Exhibit V was not a copy of the
pamphlet he
had given to AT. The pamphlet supplied to AT was an earlier version of the
pamphlet "B".  The pamphlet "B" contained
reference to a journal article which
had not been published as at February 1992.  The defendant explained that at
the time of making
his statement he had attached a copy of the current version
of  pamphlet "B". 
<P>

39   	The defendant's notes of his consultation with AT on 1
February 1992 make no reference to any sexual history taking, the provision
of
pamphlets relating to Hepatitis B or safe sex practices, or general counselling
in this regard.   
<P>

40   	The defendant's credit, in connection with these
proceedings, was the subject of strong challenge. For reasons which I set
out
below I did not accept the defendant's evidence as to some matters of
significance. It does not flow from this that I reject
the whole of it. On this
issue I consider the defendant's evidence to be preferred to the account given
by AT in his affidavit. 
<P>

41   	AT said that the defendant had asked him whether he was
gay or an intravenous drug user during his first consultation with
him. On a
subsequent consultation AT said he was advised he had contracted Hepatitis B.
The defendant told him that it was probably
contracted from a recent sexual
contact. 
<P>

42   	The defendant's notes as to the history taken at the first
consultation do not suggest any sexual history was obtained at
that time beyond
eliciting the information that AT was a separated man. It has not been
suggested that there was any need to embark
on a detailed sexual history at the
initial consultation when it was not known that AT was suffering from any form
of sexually transmitted
disease. 
<P>

43   	I find that the defendant questioned AT as to whether he
was gay or an intravenous drug user at the consultation on 1 February
1992 when
it is common ground he told him that he had probably contracted Hepatitis B
through sexual contact.  I accept that the
defendant had pamphlets concerning
safe sex practices and Hepatitis B in his rooms at that time and that he handed
AT three such
pamphlets in the course of informing him of the likely cause of
his infection.  I do not consider the fact that the defendant selected
copies
of pamphlets then on issue (including one which was not available as at
February 1992) when he came to make his statement
to his solicitors, as being
of particular significance.  
<P>

<b>The Defendant's Evidence</b>
<P>

44   	A statement signed by the defendant on 3 July 1995 was
tendered in the plaintiff's case.  Each of the expert witnesses was
supplied
with a copy of the statement and their opinions were expressed, in part, upon
an acceptance of the contents of it. In the
statement the defendant gave this
account of the consultation with AT on 1 December 1992:
<P>

"I did not see the patient again until 1 December 1992 when he presented with
fever, aches and pains, irritability and headaches.
 At the time, I recall that
the patient seemed unwell and I was concerned that he still appeared to be
troubled by the symptoms which
he had previously presented with.  I once again
questioned him about his sexual activity and he denied any homosexual contact
or
multiple partners.  I carried out a full physical examination of the ear,
nose and throat which was normal.  I also checked his right
and left tympanic
membrane which were normal.  His lymph nodes were normal, however, there was
still evidence of hepatomegaly.  
<P>

I made a provisional diagnosis of a viral illness and once again considered
that the patient required further investigation.  I
therefore ordered a full
blood count, ESR and MBA20 (which includes electrolytes, urea, creatinine and
liver function test).  As
I was concerned that the patient had had a lot of
viruses, I suggested that an HIV test would be appropriate.  The patient,
however,
did not consider that this was necessary.  In view of the patient's
reluctance and the fact that his history did not reveal any risk
factors, I did
not order the test.  I asked the patient to return for review as necessary."
<P>

45   	A copy of the doctor's clinical notes was also tendered in
the course of the plaintiff's case.  The notes for the attendance
of 1 December
1992 included the following : 
<P>

&#183;	denies any H/S contact or multiple partners, 
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	HIV not required as pt doesn't feel it is necessary, 
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	R/V PRN.
<P>

  
<P>

46   	During the course of the hearing the plaintiff sought
leave to uplift the original of the doctor's notes.  Subsequently, Dr
Walton, a
document examiner, was called.  In her report dated 24 June 1999 she expressed
the opinion that some of the entries for
the consultation on 1 December 1992
were added at a time after other of the entries.  Dr Walton also noted that the
page containing
the notes of 1 December 1992 appeared to have been crumpled
into a paper ball and subsequently flattened, probably by pressing. 
 In the
light of the defendant's evidence concerning the notes it is not necessary to
dwell on Dr Walton's evidence in detail.
<P>

 
<P>

47   	Dr Walton was the last witness called in the plaintiff's
case. The defendant was not aware of the contents of her report until
shortly
before he was called to give evidence.  It was his evidence that not all the
entries recorded for the consultation on 1 December
1992 were written at the
same time. He said this: 
<P>

"When I started with the patient explaining about his symptoms and when I
finished with the patient I realised there were a few
things I have not
mentioned in my records, so on the same day, later on, I added what I thought
was quite important at the time."
<P>

48   	The additional matters were the items which are set out in
bullet points in paragraph 44 above.  
<P>

49   	The defendant explained that after he received the
telephone call from Mr Hirsch advising him of the proposed proceedings,
in a
moment of anger, he had screwed up the notes.  Subsequently, realising his
foolishness, he had obtained his wife's assistance
to iron the notes.  
<P>

50   	There is no suggestion that Mr Hirsch in the course of his
telephone discussion with the defendant on 23 February 1995 informed
him of the
detail of the allegation made by his client.  However, the broad outlines of
the plaintiff's case were made clear to the
representative of the Medical
Defence Union with whom Mr Hirsch had dealings on 23 February 1995.  The
defendant sent a copy of the
notes by facsimile to the Medical Defence Union.
He was not certain when that was done but he was clear it was before he
provided
his detailed statement in July of 1995. The significance of this
relates to the fact that the additions to the notes were of matters
which were
directly relevant to the present proceedings.
<P>

51   	On the plaintiff's behalf it was put to the defendant that
he had falsified the subject entries. He denied doing so. 
<P>

52   	In the course of his cross-examination the defendant
stated that he had "strongly suggested" to AT that an HIV test would
be
appropriate during the course of the consultation on 1 December 1992. 
<P>

53   	The defendant was asked why he suggested the HIV test and
he said this (T 238):
<P>

"Well, just looking from the history, he has had five or six attacks of fevers,
chills and viral like illnesses on top of the urinary
tract infection he
contracted, which was not explained by the normal urinary tract abnormalities
because I did a pyelogram to rule
out any abnormalities and that was normal, so
one of the likelihood of contracting urinary tract infection in a male is by
having
anal sex."
<P>

The defendant went on to agree that anal sex is a risk factor for HIV.  He was
asked why, in his statement of July 1995, he had
stated that AT did not reveal
any risk factors.  He said that this was because AT had not admitted to any.

<P>

54   	In the light of the defendant's evidence it might be
thought that the statement supplied by him to his solicitors in July
1995
contained two notable omissions: (i) that AT's symptoms and history suggested
the possibility that he had engaged in anal intercourse
(contrary to his
denials) and (ii) that, accordingly, the defendant had strongly suggested AT
undergo an HIV test.
<P>

55   	I was not favourably impressed by the defendant's
demeanour during his evidence concerning the consultation on 1 December
1992
or the circumstances in which he made the additions to his notes. I do not
accept his account that he strongly advised AT to
have an HIV test. Nor do I
accept that the defendant suggested that AT take an HIV test and later on that
day, or shortly thereafter,
decided to make an addition to his notes of the
consultation to record that fact.
<P>

56   	In his affidavit AT denied that the defendant had at any
time suggested that he undergo an HIV test. In the period 1 February
to 1
December 1992 AT underwent a number of tests as requested by the defendant.  He
attended for follow-up consultations to learn
the results of the tests.
Ultimately, when Dr Koorey recommended that AT undergo an HIV antibody test, he
did so.
<P>

57   	I consider it more probable than not that AT was not given
any advice to  undergo an HIV test at the consultation on 1 December
1992.
<P>

<b>BT's evidence</b>
<P>

58   	I have set out a number of factual findings based upon the
evidence given by BT. I should note that BT's credit was the subject
of
challenge in the proceedings. In particular, emphasis was placed on her
admission to having deliberately misled Australian consular
officials in
connection with her application to obtain a visa for entry to Australia (T
130). She agreed that she was attracted to
emigrating to Australia because it
provided better financial security for her than life in her country of birth
might have done (T
129). The admission to having been willing to mislead
consular officials in order to advance her financial interests must engender
a
degree of caution in the approach to the evidence of BT.  Despite this, I was
inclined to accept  BT and did so in relation to
the matters set out in
paragraphs 16 - 27 &amp; 29 above.  On occasions her answers did not advance
her interests. In particular,
she acknowledged that she and AT had engaged in
unprotected sexual intercourse on occasions after she was warned not to do so
by
her own doctor (in the light of the perceived risk of contracting Hepatitis
B) (T 125/6). I believe that BT understood the significance
of that evidence.
The cross examiner returned to the topic the following day and BT did not
endeavour to vary or qualify her account
 (T 136).  
<P>

59   	BT was challenged as to her account of being present
during one of AT's  consultations with the defendant.  She said they
had been
in the defendant's rooms a relatively short time and that "he just used a
syringe to clean the ear of AT" (T 160). She was
questioned as to whether AT
had on that day made a number of other complaints to the defendant. While
maintaining that AT's major
problem on that occasion was the ringing in the
ears she recalled that AT "got some more problems like stomach pain"(T 160). It
was
put to BT that she was mistaken in her evidence as to being present in the
room when the defendant syringed AT's ears (T 161). The
defendant gave no
evidence to contradict BT's account of this consultation. His notes seem to me
to provide support in general terms
for her recollection; they record the
ringing in the ears and that AT had left sided abdominal pain/constipation. It
appears from
the notes that the defendant did syringe AT's ears. 
<P>

<b>The Duty of Care Owed to BT</b>
<P>

60   	The plaintiff claims that the defendant owed to her a duty
of care. The content of the duty said to have been owed by the
defendant to BT
was to diagnose AT's HIV infection and/or to give proper counselling and advice
to AT as to the need for an HIV test.
 The duty to BT (and to any other sexual
partner of AT) is discharged by the diagnosis and provision of proper advice to
the patient.

<P>

61   	The defendant submits that no duty was owed by him to BT.
The defendant points to the following facts which are not in dispute:
<P>

&#183;	At no time was BT a patient of the defendant.  
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	At no time did AT disclose to the defendant the existence of a sexual
relationship between himself and BT.
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	At no time did AT specifically seek from the defendant any treatment
for, or advice about, his HIV status.
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	AT's HIV positive status was not caused by any action or inaction on the
part of the defendant.
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	HIV is a lifelong infection which can be transmitted to other people in
a variety of ways both sexually and non-sexually.
 A person infected can
retransmit the infection once acquired.
<P>

62   	The plaintiff pleads that she "is within the class of
persons who were at risk of foreseeable injury if the defendant failed
to
properly counsel and advise AT to have an HIV test".  The defendant does not
seek to contend that the plaintiff, as a sexual partner
of AT, was not a person
at risk of foreseeable injury but submits that something more than this
consideration alone is required in
order to found a duty of care; <b>Jaensch v
Coffey</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155 CLR 549</a> per Gibbs CJ at 553, per Deane J at 581-583;
<b>Bryan v Maloney</b> (1995) 182 CLR 609 per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaurdron JJ
at 617-619;  <b>Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerford</b>

<P>

63   	As the defendant submitted, the identification of the
additional element required to give rise to a duty of care is not easy
to
discern. At the date of making submissions on behalf of the defendant it was
noted that proximity is no longer a universal determinant
although it was
suggested it may still have some role to play. That was prior to the High
Court's judgment in <b>Perre v Apand Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 36</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%201190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR
1190</a> which confirms the move away in recent years from seeing proximity as the
unifying criterion of the duty of care; see Gleeson CJ
at para 9; Gaudron J at
para 27, McHugh J at paras 74 and 78; Gummow J at paras 198-201; Hayne J at
paras at 330-333.
<P>

64   	<b>Perre </b>was a case arising out of a claim for
negligently inflicted pure economic loss.  However, there are passages in the
judgements as
to the ingredients of the duty of care which appear of broader
application. Gummow J (with whose reasons on this aspect Gleeson CJ
agreed)
said:
<P>

"In determining whether the relationship is so close that the duty of care
arises, attention is to be paid to the particular connections
between the
parties ... There is no simple formula which can mask the necessity for
examination of the particular facts. That this
is so is not a problem to be
solved; rather, as Priestley JA put it in <b>Avenhouse v Hornsby Shire
Council</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 1</a> at 8 `it is a situation to be recognised'" (para
198). 
<P>

Amongst the factors that his Honour identified as justifying a finding that a
duty was owed in that case were (i) the defendant's
knowledge of the risk (ii)
the appellants had no way of appreciating the existence of the risk to which
the respondent's conduct
exposed them and, thus, had no avenue to protect
themselves (at para 216).  
<P>

65   	McHugh J placed emphasis on the vulnerability of the
plaintiff to incurring loss in consequence of the defendant's conduct.
His
Honour considered that the defendant's knowledge of the risk and its magnitude
would be relevant in all pure economic loss cases
and might be relevant in
other circumstances (paras 104, 105 and 129). 
<P>

66   	In <b>Hill v Van Erp</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 159</a> the majority
found the solicitor owed a duty of care to the third party/beneficiary. That
was a case involving a claim for pure economic
loss, although the facts did not
give rise to concerns as to indeterminacy either in the number or extent of
claims. The suggestion
that the imposition of a duty in favour of the third
party conflicted with the solicitor's duty to her client was rejected; the
interests
of the solicitor's client and the plaintiff being coincident. 
<P>

67   	Of the recent decisions of the High Court dealing with
constituent elements of the duty of care in the law of negligence to
which I
was taken, <b>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] HCA 3</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20192%20CLR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 192 CLR
330</a> is the only one not concerned with a pure economic loss claim. However, its
usefulness for present purposes is limited to some degree
by the centrality of
the statutory powers of the Council to the way in which their Honours decided
the case.  
<P>

68   	In the course of his reasons in <b>Pyrenees</b>, Gummow J
observed that the situation occupied by the Shire "gave it a significant and
special measure of control over the safety
from fire of persons and property".
His Honour went on:
<P>

"[the] statutory enablement of the Shire `facilitate[d] the existence of a
common law duty of care' but the touchstone of what I
would hold to be its duty
was the Shire's measure of control of the situation including its knowledge,
not shared by Mr and Mrs Stamatopoulos
or by the Days, that, if the situation
were not remedied, the possibility of fire was great and damage to the whole
row of shops
might ensue.  The Shire had a duty of care `to safeguard others
from a grave danger of serious harm', in circumstances where it was
`responsible for its continued existence and [was] aware of the likelihood of
others coming into proximity of the danger and [had]
the means of preventing it
or of averting the danger or of bringing it to their knowledge'." (at para
168).
<P>

69   	In <b>Pyrenees</b>, in determining that a duty of care was
owed, Kirby J referred especially to the risk of danger, the latency of the
defect and the
inability of the claimants to protect themselves (at para
255).
<P>

70   	The defendant submitted in a case such as the present in
which a duty of care is said to arise in novel circumstances, while
a process
of reasoning by analogy from decided cases may be appropriate, I would bear in
mind the injunction that there is no scope
for decision by reference to
idiosyncratic notions of justice and morality: <b> Sutherland Shire Council v
Heyman</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 424</a> per Deane J at 498. This is not to say that
considerations of public policy do not underlie the determination of the
existence of
a duty of care in novel cases as Deane J explained in the above
passage.  Unsurprisingly both the plaintiff and the defendant have
addressed
submissions as to what are said to be the competing reasons of policy for and
against the existence of a duty. 
<P>

71   	In the present case the plaintiff submits that the
defendant by virtue of his specialist training and knowledge, was in a
position
to know (or should have known) that in the light of AT's history and symptoms
AT was at risk of having contracted HIV. 
It was reasonably foreseeable that
AT, if HIV positive, would transmit the virus to sexual partners.  Neither AT
nor his sexual partners
may be in a position to understand the risk (AT had not
progressed to an AIDS related illness at the material time). In this respect
AT's HIV condition was latent. In determining whether a duty is owed it is
submitted that the magnitude of the risk is an appropriate
matter to take into
account. 
<P>

72   	The plaintiff relied on three North American decisions in
which like issues have arisen.  In <b>Pittman Estate v Bain</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20112%20DLR%20%284th%29%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 112 DLR
(4th) 257</a>, Lang J in the Ontario Court (General Division) dealt with such a
case at first instance.  A patient undergoing cardiac surgery at
the Toronto
Hospital in 1984 received a transfusion of blood from a donor who was HIV
positive.  In 1989 the head of the hospital's
blood bank informed the patient's
doctor that the transfusion had been contaminated.  The doctor was concerned
about the effects
of this news on his patient's mental and cardiac condition.
He took the view, wrongly, that the patient was no longer engaging in
sexual
intercourse.  Having regard to these considerations he determined not to inform
his patient of his possible HIV status.  The
patient died in March 1990 and at
that time it was discovered that he was HIV positive.  In September 1990 the
patient's wife was
diagnosed as being HIV positive.  She, and the estate of the
deceased husband, commenced proceedings against the doctor.  
<P>

73   	Lang J found that the doctor had a duty to inform his
patient of the possibility that he had contracted HIV.  He found that
the
doctor had breached that duty.  His Honour went on to observe (at 401) that:
<P>

"[i]n this context, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether Dr Bain had
an independent duty to Mrs Pittman, because Dr Bain
did have an obligation to
tell Mr Pittman, and if he had told Mr Pittman, the evidence established that
Mr Pittman would have told
his wife."
<P>

74   	His Honour proceeded to an assessment of damages for the
injuries sustained by the plaintiff wife.  No alternative basis for
compensating her, save that the defendant doctor breached an independent duty
owed to her, was advanced. However, as appears from
the passage extracted above
the decision did not involve an analysis of the basis upon which his Honour
arrived at the determination
and is thus of little guidance for present
purposes.  
<P>

75   	The plaintiff also relied on the decision of  <b>Reisner v
Regents of the University of California</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=37%20Cal%20Rptr%202d%20518" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">37 Cal Rptr 2d 518</a> (1995).  In that
case a twelve year old girl received a transfusion of blood contaminated with
HIV.  The following day her doctor
discovered that the blood was contaminated.
He determined not to tell the child or her parents of that fact.  Three years
later the
girl commenced a relationship with the plaintiff.  They engaged in
sexual intercourse.  Two years later the defendant doctor informed
the girl of
her HIV status.  She in turn informed the plaintiff who was tested and found to
have contracted HIV.  The plaintiff commenced
proceedings against the defendant
doctor.  
<P>

76   	The defendant doctor in <b>Reisner</b> moved successfully
for summary judgment. The plaintiff appealed.  The California Court of Appeal
noted that the defendant had conceded
that:
<P>

"[w]hen the avoidance of foreseeable harm to a third person requires a
defendant to control the conduct of a person with whom the
defendant has a
special relationship (such as physician and patient) or to warn the person of
the risks involved in certain conduct,
the defendant's duty extends to a third
person with whom the defendant does not have a special relationship." (at
520)
<P>

In <b>Reisner</b> it was the plaintiff's case, as here, that the defendant's
duty was discharged by warning his patient (or her parents).  The court
appears
to have accepted the view that the plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable
plaintiff, even though his actual identity was
neither known to nor
ascertainable by the defendant.  It noted (at 521):
<P>

"[He] knew or reasonably should have known that, as she matured, Jennifer was
likely to enter an intimate relationship."
<P>

77   	The court found that the defendant doctor owed a duty to
the plaintiff, as a reasonably foreseeable person, to warn his patient
of the
likelihood that she was infected and of the need, accordingly, for her to take
appropriate precautions.  It concluded that:
<P>

"[o]nce the physician warns the patient of the risk to others and advises the
patient how to prevent the spread of the disease,
the physician has fulfilled
his duty - and no more (but no less) is required." (at 523)
<P>

It is to be noted that in <b>Reisner</b> the defendant doctor's knowledge was
of the fact of the transfusion of blood contaminated by HIV antibodies.
<P>

78   	The plaintiff  also relied on <b>Di Marco v Lynch
Homes-Chester County Inc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=583%20A%202d%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">583 A 2d 422</a> (1990). In that case a health worker
suffered a needle stick injury while taking blood from an elderly resident at
the defendant's
nursing home.  She was advised that the resident was a carrier
of Hepatitis.  She sought medical advice and was informed that if
she did not
contract Hepatitis within six weeks she would not contract it at all.  She was
further advised not to engage in sexual
intercourse during the six week period.
She refrained from sexual relations for an eight week period but thereafter
resumed a sexual
relationship with the plaintiff, with whom she did not live.
She and the plaintiff were subsequently diagnosed as suffering from
Hepatitis
B.  
<P>

79   	The plaintiff brought proceedings before the Court of
Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.  The proceedings were dismissed,
the court
noting that physicians do not have control over the sexual conduct of their
patients.  The Superior Court of Pennsylvania
reversed the finding of the Court
of Common Pleas and remanded the matter; <b>Di Marco v Lynch Homes-Chester
County Inc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=559%20A%202d%20530" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">559 A 2d 530</a> (1989). 
<P>

80   	The decision of the Superior Court was appealed to the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.  The decision of the Superior Court
was affirmed
by majority (Larsen, McDermott, Papadakos and Cappy JJ;  Nix CJ, Flaherty and
Zapalla JJ dissenting):  <b>Di Marco v Lynch Homes-Chester County Inc</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=583%20A%202d%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">583 A
2d 422</a> (1990).  The majority observed that when a physician treats a patient
who has been exposed to a communicable disease it is imperative
that the
physician give the patient proper advice in order to prevent the spread of the
disease.  Such measures are necessary not
for the benefit of the already
infected patient, but with a view to the protection of others.  They
observed:
<P>

"the duty of a physician in such circumstances extends to those `within the
foreseeable orbit of risk of harm' ... If a third person
is in that class of
persons whose health is likely to be threatened by the patient, and if
erroneous advice is given to that patient
to the ultimate detriment of the
third person, the third person has a cause of action against the physician,
because the physician
should recognise that the services rendered to the
patient are necessary for the protection of the third person" (at 424-425).
<P>

81   	Their Honours concluded (at 425) that:
<P>

"the class of persons whose health is likely to be threatened by the patient
includes anyone who is physically intimate with the
patient.  Those, like the
trial court, who insist that we cannot predict, or foresee, that a patient will
engage in sexual activity
outside of the marital relationship and that thus, we
need not protect those who engage in `casual' sex, are exalting an unheeded
morality over reality."
<P>

82   	The question of whether a duty is owed by a health service
provider to the sexual partner of a patient was considered by the
Court of
Appeal in <b>Goodwill v British Pregnancy Advisory Service</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20All%20ER%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 All ER
161.</a> In that case the plaintiff's boyfriend, Mr McKinlay, had undergone a
vasectomy before the couple met. When they commenced their sexual
relationship
he told her of the procedure and of his advice that it had been successful.
Subsequently the plaintiff conceived a child
and became aware of the pregnancy
when it was too late for an abortion. She brought proceedings seeking damages
for the expenses
associated with her daughter's birth and the costs of raising
her. The court found that the defendants were not in a special relationship
with the plaintiff such as to give rise to a duty of care. Emphasis was placed
on the circumstance that the plaintiff was not Mr
McKinlay's sexual partner at
the time the defendants advised him. The class to which the plaintiff belonged
was any woman who might
be a potential sexual partner of Mr McKinlay over the
span of his life. This was too uncertain a class to impose any duty of care
upon persons advising Mr McKinlay as to his fertility. 
<P>

83   	It is to be noted that <b>Goodwill</b> was a claim for
pure economic loss based upon a third party's reliance on negligent advice. 
<P>

84   	The defendant submitted that before a duty can be held to
arise it is essential that the plaintiff is known to or capable
of being
readily identified by the tortfeasor. 
<P>

85   	With respect to consequential economic loss the defendant
acknowledged that it may sometimes be sufficient if the class is
"capable of
being ascertained":  <b>Caltex Oil (Australia) P/L v The Dredge
`Willemstad'</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 136 CLR 529</a> at 555.  In such cases, the defendant
submitted, there must nevertheless be a degree of certainty about the identity
of the individual.
 In this sense merely being able to describe a class is not
enough.  Relying on <b>Alcock v Chief Constable</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20AC%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 AC 310</a> at 410E the
defendant submitted that the impracticability or unreasonableness of
entertaining claims to the ultimate limits of human
activity tells against the
existence of a duty.  
<P>

86   	The defendant submitted that the class to which BT belongs
must as a matter of logic include not only all sexual partners
including future
sexual partners but also others at risk of infection by AT. Thus health workers
or others who might come into contact
with AT's blood products would also fall
within it.  The members of the class may not be in existence at the time of the
tortious
conduct.  They bear no relation to the defendant and are not capable
of being known to him or ascertained by him. 
<P>

87   	I do not consider that the fact that the members of the
class may not be known or be capable of ready identification by the
defendant
is determinative of there being no duty of care.  In <b>Voli v Inglewood Shire
Council </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20110%20CLR%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 110 CLR 74</a>, in finding that the architect owed a duty,
Windeyer J observed that the architect:
<P>

"knew the purpose for which the hall was being built, and the use to which it
would be put.  His duty of care extended to persons
who would come there to use
it in the ordinary way" (at 85).  
<P>

There was no pre-existing relationship between the architect and the plaintiff
in that case.  The architect at all relevant times
was unaware of the
plaintiff's existence.  The plaintiff could only recover upon the basis that he
was a member of a reasonably foreseeable
class of persons.  The defendant
acknowledged as much in his written submissions observing:
<P>

"On some occasions, a known class of people may suffice for a duty to be owed
but this is capable of ready identification and has
a physical
relationship/proximity with the tortfeasor.  See <b>Voli v Inglewood Shire
Council </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20110%20CLR%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 110 CLR 74".  (Defendant's</a> outline of submissions para
13.2).    
<P>

88   	The class to whom the architect owed a duty were all those
persons who came into the hall lawfully to use it in the ordinary
way.  Viewed
in that way the architect's duty was potentially to a very large and
unidentified group.  
<P>

89   	It does not seem to me that the policy considerations
concerning indeterminate liability are raised by the facts of this case
more
acutely than in <b>Voli</b>.
<P>

90   	The defendant submitted <b>Voli </b>involved the same sort
of direct infliction of physical injury as is seen in the motor vehicle
collision cases. The stage collapsed
because it was constructed in accordance
with the defendant's negligently prepared plans. It was in this context that
the finding
of the duty should be understood. In contrast it was contended that
the cause of BT's injury was the sexual contact  between her
and AT.  The duty
alleged by the plaintiff here, so it was submitted, is in effect identical with
a duty to rescue; to save BT from
a harm which was not caused by the defendant.
It is the plaintiff's case that she suffered injury in consequence of the
defendant's
negligent failure to diagnose and or adequately advise her sexual
partner as to his risk of infection with a fatal sexually transmissible
viral
illness.  On her behalf evidence has been led to establish that the great
majority of persons, if made aware of their HIV positive
status, will avoid
exposing their partners to risk of infection. The rescue analogy requires a
restrictive view of the cause of the
plaintiff's injury. It does not in my view
hold good. 
<P>

91   	I note the issue of a medical practitioner's duty with
respect to rescue was dealt with in <b>Lownes v</b> <b>Woods </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2c376" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) Aust
Torts Reports 81,376.</a> That case has significance for the way in which the Court
took into account the obligations imposed on medical practitioners under
the
<b>Medical Practitioners Act</b> 1938 on the question of whether it was
appropriate to impose a duty of care on the doctor in relation to a person (in
need of urgent
treatment) who was not his patient. The majority held that the
primary judge had been right to take into account the statutory obligation
(to
provide attention) in determining that a relationship of proximity had been
made out. 
<P>

92   	It is to be noted that s 12(1) <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pha1991126/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Health Act</a></b>
1991 requires a medical practitioner who believes on reasonable grounds that
his or her patient is suffering from a sexually transmissible
medical condition
to provide the patient with such information as is required by the Regulations
made under that Act. Regulation
4 of the <b>Public Health Regulation</b> 1991
sets out the categories of information which is to be supplied:
<P>

(a) means of minimising the risk of infecting other people with the
condition;
<P>

(b) public health implications of the condition;
<P>

(c) responsibilities under s 11 of the Act, including any precautions
considered reasonable;
<P>

(d) responsibilities under s 13 of the Act;
<P>

(e) diagnosis and prognosis;
<P>

(f) treatment options.
<P>

93   	Section 13 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pha1991126/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Health Act</a></b> makes it an
offence for a person who knows that he or she suffers from a sexually
transmissible medical condition to have sexual
intercourse with another person
unless, before the intercourse takes place, the other person has been informed
of the risk of contracting
a sexually transmissible medical condition and has
voluntarily agreed to accept that risk.
<P>

94   	The scheme of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pha1991126/" class="autolink_findacts">Public Health Act</a></b> thus requires a
medical practitioner who reasonably believes his or her patient to have HIV to
inform the patient of the public health
implications of the condition and of
the means of protecting others. The practitioner must inform the patient of the
patient's statutory
responsibility to warn prospective sexual partners of his
or her condition. These provisions seem to me to have some bearing on the
submissions with which I next deal concerning conflict of interest, therapeutic
privilege and doctor/patient confidentiality as well
as the broader question of
whether it is appropriate to impose a duty such as that pleaded on a
practitioner in relation to the sexual
partners of his or her patients.
<P>

95   	The defendant submitted that there are policy reasons
which tell against a duty being owed by the defendant to BT.  Firstly,
any such
duty, it was submitted, may involve a conflict with the duty owed by the
defendant to AT.  A doctor's duty to his patient
does not permit him to place
the interests of any person above those of his patient.  A conflict, actual or
potential, is a strong
policy reason, so it was submitted, to hold against the
existence of a secondary duty to a person such as BT.  Such a submission
would
have more force if it were being suggested that the content of the duty
required the doctor to warn his patient's sexual partners.
 That is not the
case here.  The duty is discharged by the doctor providing his patient with
appropriate and adequate advice.  In
such a circumstance it is difficult to see
how as a matter of practical reality a conflict could arise.  
<P>

96   	The defendant submitted that a potential for conflict
arose in the context of the therapeutic privilege which may justify
a doctor in
withholding information from his or her patient where it is in the patient's
best interests so to do. In a case where
a medical practitioner believes on
reasonable grounds that his or her patient has contracted HIV, therapeutic
privilege would not,
in the light of the statutory obligation cast on the
practitioner, allow of a decision to withhold information either as to the
patient's
status or obligations with respect to notifying sexual partners.  
<P>

97   	The defendant also relied upon the confidentiality of the
doctor/patient relationship.  In written submissions it was put
this way:
<P>

"The only person who can release the doctor from the obligation of confidence
is the patient.  But if a duty is owed to a third
party by the doctor, then in
order to discharge that duty it may be necessary for the doctor to breach the
obligation of confidentiality.
 Which is to prevail?  That is an impossible
choice.  The only course open is to hold that there is no duty."
<P>

In the way the plaintiff pleads her case considerations of confidentiality do
not strike me as raising issues of real substance.
There is no suggestion that
the obligation on the doctor extends beyond the provision of adequate advice to
the patient.  
<P>

98   	I consider in the circumstances of this case that the
plaintiff has established that the defendant owed to her a duty of care.
 In
arriving at this conclusion I have taken into account the following matters:

<P>

&#183;	There is no conflict between the duty owed by the defendant to AT and BT
as the two are coincident;
<P>

&#183;	BT was a sexual partner of AT;
<P>

&#183;	It was reasonably foreseeable that AT, if HIV positive, would transmit
the virus to a sexual partner;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	AT's was unaware of his HIV status (in this respect the condition was
latent);
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	The defendant's specialist knowledge and training equipped him to
identify the risk that AT had contracted HIV;
<P>

	
<P>

&#183;	Failure to diagnose and adequately counsel AT to undertake an HIV
antibody test exposed AT's sexual partner/s to the real
risk of contracting a
fatal disease.
<P>

It is the combination of these factors, together with a consideration of public
policy reflected in the statutory obligations placed
upon medical practitioners
with respect to the treatment of and supply of information to patients with
sexually transmissible medical
conditions, which to my mind makes the
imposition of the duty appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 
<P>

<b>Breach of Duty</b>
<P>

99   	The nature and content of the defendant's duty to AT (and
by extension to BT) is as set out in <b>Rogers v Whitaker</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR
479</a> 489-490 and 492-493. It is to exercise the reasonable care and skill
expected of a general practitioner in 1992. It is alleged that
the defendant
fell below that standard in his failure both to consider a possible diagnosis
of HIV and to advise appropriately. In
this case expert evidence as to the
practice of general practitioners in 1992 plays an influential role in
ascertaining the standard
demanded by the law. 
<P>

100   	The plaintiff submits that reasonably informed general
practitioners practising in the inner city suburbs of Sydney in 1992
would have
been aware of the association between Hepatitis B (and other sexually
transmissible diseases) and HIV. 
<P>

101   	It is the plaintiff's case that as at 1 February 1992,
when AT's Hepatitis B was confirmed and the defendant obtained a history
which
included reference to AT's "casual exploits" as a possible source of his
infection, the defendant's failure to consider a diagnosis
of HIV and to
counsel AT to undergo an HIV antibody test fell below the standard of skill and
care of an ordinary general practitioner
practising in Sydney in 1992.
<P>

102   	By the 1 December 1992 consultation when AT returned
reporting fever and aches and pains it is submitted that the defendant
was even
more clearly on notice of HIV as a possible diagnosis such that, even if he
suggested an HIV test (which is not accepted),
his advice was inadequate and,
again, fell below the standard of a general practitioner exercising ordinary
care and skill.  
<P>

103   	The plaintiff relied on the evidence of Drs Law, Furner
and Fisher. Dr Fisher is a very experienced general practitioner.
His many
appointments include a term as President of the Royal Australian College of
General Practitioners.   In a report dated 4
July 1996 Dr Fisher expressed the
following opinion:
<P>

"A reasonably informed general practitioner practising in inner city Sydney in
1992 to 1993 would in my opinion have recognised
that where a man is an active
heterosexual, who practises unprotected sexual intercourse and has Hepatitis B
believed to have been
acquired sexually would assume that the man may well have
been exposed to HIV.  He ought therefore have been counselled and advised
to
have an HIV test and to only have protected sexual intercourse whilst he is
infectious with Hepatitis B."
<P>

Dr Fisher went on to note that in his opinion a reasonably informed general
practitioner practising in the inner city of Sydney
in 1992 to 1993 would have
recognised that fevers, night sweats, lethargy, lymphadenopathy and chronic ill
health during early 1992
were consistent with lowered resistance and HIV
infection.  He noted that the period of generally good health experienced by AT
between
March and December 1992 followed by a recurrence of symptoms was also
consistent with HIV infection.  It should be noted that there
is no evidence
that AT gave a history of night sweats to the defendant.
<P>

104   	Dr Fisher's evidence was that in 1992 a reasonably
competent general practitioner would have been aware of the link between
Hepatitis B and HIV (T141). He considered the presence of  Hepatitis B mandated
advice as to HIV testing. He rejected the proposition
that such a view
represented an extreme position with respect to the standard expected of a
reasonably competent general practitioner
in 1992 (T 148). 
<P>

105   	Dr Carmela Law was qualified as a sexual health physician
who has been involved with GP education for more than ten years.
She is a
fellow of the Australasian College of Sexual Health Physicians. She is the
Director of the Manly Sexual Health Service.
In particular she has created and
taught a course on `sexual history taking skills'. The need for such a course
appears to have been
identified by her when she was co-ordinator of medical
student teaching on sexual health for the Universities of Sydney and New South
Wales in 1991. Additionally, she has conducted a training programme for general
practitioners on sexually transmitted diseases. 
<P>

106   	The defendant submitted that I should be careful in
accepting the opinion of Dr Law as to the standard of care expected of
general
practitioners in 1992 because her practice is a specialised one. The patients
who present to the Manly Sexual Health Service
are not representative of the
spectrum of patients attending an ordinary general practice in inner-city
Sydney. That is so. However,
Dr Law made allowance for that. In her report when
she addressed the question of the level of publicity in 1992 about
seroconversion
illness and the similarity of risk factors for transmission of
HIV and Hepatitis B, she was looking, as I understand it, not at the
information available to specialised sexual health practitioners but to that
available to those in general practice. 
<P>

107   	Dr Law was inclined to posit a less rigorous standard for
general practitioners than was Dr Fisher. Dr Fisher was of the
view that the
presence of Hepatitis B (presumed to be sexually acquired) in a heterosexual
male mandated the need for an HIV antibody
test. On this view the defendant's
failure to recommend one on 1 February 1992 was negligent. In her report Dr Law
took into account
the demands of general practice and considered it
understandable that a diagnosis of HIV infection might be missed on the first
occasion.
The combination of Hepatitis B infection and the admission of "casual
exploits" together called for a detailed sexual history taking.
She went on to
comment that there were several consultations following that on 1 February 1992
which offered opportunities to reconsider
the diagnosis, retake the history,
confer with colleagues and generally review the case as there were ongoing
symptoms (report para
4 p 3). By the 1 December 1992 consultation Dr Law was of
the opinion that there was a need for a detailed sexual history taking
(report
para 1 p 1). In evidence Dr Law explained it was important to conduct a risk
assessment because Hepatitis B is a sexually
transmissible disease (T 48). 
<P>

108   	Dr Furner, the Deputy Director of the Albion Street
Centre, a specialist service providing comprehensive treatment for patients
with HIV/AIDS, stated in her report dated 30 May 1997: 
<P>

 "I completely agree with the proposition that where a heterosexual is
diagnosed as having Hepatitis B that was presumably sexually
acquired the
patient ought to be counselled regarding the advisability of a HIV test. There
is strong epidemiological evidence that
patients can acquire more than one
sexually transmitted disease simultaneously, and that the presence of sexually
acquired Hepatitis
B infection must always alert a clinician to the possibility
of co-infection with HIV, and additional tests should be conducted to
exclude
this possibility."
<P>

109   	Dr Furner was an impressive witness and I had no
hesitation in accepting her evidence. However, it is to be noted that the
opinion set out above is not directed to the situation as it stood in 1992 with
respect to the standard of competence of general
practitioners. This is an
important consideration. I did not understand any of the expert witnesses (with
the possible exception
of Dr Gray whose report did not address this issue) to
gainsay the proposition that as at 1997 (the date of Dr Furner's report) a
prudent general practitioner would recommend an HIV antibody test in the
presence of Hepatitis B believed to have been sexually acquired.
There was
evidence that the Commonwealth Government had sponsored a programme of
education for general practitioners to so advise
them in 1993/1994. 
<P>

110   	Associate Professor Graeme Stewart, Director of the
Department of Clinical Immunology at Westmead Hospital, gave evidence
in the
defendant's case.  Professor Stewart has a lengthy and distinguished career
involvement relating to HIV disease, both clinically
and in the development of
government policy. 
<P>

111   	Professor Stewart was asked to comment in his report on
the state of knowledge of the general public regarding HIV infection
and its
transmission and Hepatitis B infection and its transmission as well as the
nature of the information available to the public
in this regard in the period
1992 - 1993. He said that it was difficult to be certain of the state of
knowledge of the general public
in 1992 - 1993. Following the "Grim Reaper"
campaign in the 1980's he considered that "it would be most unusual for a
sexually active
adult not to be aware that HIV infection is transmitted
sexually both by homosexual and heterosexual contact" (report para 10).
Professor
Stewart went on to state that the level of public knowledge with
respect to the transmission of Hepatitis B would have been less
although he did
not profess to be expert to comment in the area of Hepatitis B.
<P>

112   	In 1992 Professor Stewart was concerned that the
diagnosis of HIV was one commonly missed.  He explained that since many
doctors
had graduated before HIV was identified, this was not surprising. It was
Professor Stewart who persuaded the Commonwealth
Government in that year to
fund the national education programme to which I have referred. This was
conducted during 1993 and 1994
under the title "Could it be HIV?".  A series of
articles published in the Medical Journal of Australia in the period January to
March 1993 on the topic of HIV were bound into a monograph and distributed to
every doctor and medical student in Australia.  The
defendant would have
received his copy after his last consultation with AT.
<P>

113   	In summary, Professor Stewart expressed his opinion
thus:
<P>

"I do not believe that a reasonably competent general practitioner during the
period of 1992 to January 1993 would have been expected
to diagnose HIV
infection in this circumstance, particularly taking into account AT was a
heterosexual man in Australia.  Diagnosing
HIV infection in clinical practice
can be extremely difficult and exceptionally so for patients who are not in an
identified high
risk group."
<P>

114   	Professor Stewart considered that if AT was homosexual or
bisexual it would have been inappropriate not to have arranged
an HIV test but
in his view it was commonplace not to do so in relation to a heterosexual man
(T 191-192). Similarly, if a patient
stated he had had sex with a sex worker,
that would raise a suspicion in relation to the desirability of an HIV test (T
195). 
<P>

115   	The defendant also relied on the report of Dr Gray,
general practitioner. In Dr Gray's view an HIV test would not necessarily
be
recommended as part of the investigation of a patient with Hepatitis B.  In his
opinion there was nothing in the investigations
carried out on AT or his
clinical presentation which would necessarily suggest a diagnosis of HIV or
warrant HIV testing.  In this
regard the doctor said in his report:
<P>

"AT did not have all of the predisposing factors and in retrospect the fact
that he was HIV positive did not appear until much later,
after passing through
the hands of quite eminent specialists."
<P>

Dr Gray considered that the supply of pamphlets to AT was sufficient advice
relating to his Hepatitis B condition and safe sex practices
generally. 
<P>

116   	It is to be noted that both Dr Gray and Professor Stewart
remarked on the fact that other doctors dealing with AT after the
defendant had
ceased treating him did not appear to consider a diagnosis of HIV until
November 1994 when Dr Koorey did so.  If it
be the case that a reasonably
competent general practitioner in Sydney in 1992 should have considered a
diagnosis of HIV having regard
to the history taken and the symptoms observed
by the defendant, the fact that other practitioners might have failed to meet
that
standard would not assist the defendant.
<P>

117   	Dr Gray's answer to the question of whether an HIV test
would normally be recommended as part of an investigation of a patient
with
Hepatitis B was in these terms: "Not necessarily ... as the symptoms of AT were
very like Hep B but also could have been those
of AIDS which was diagnosed much
later but probably not present at this stage". I do not understand any of the
plaintiff's experts
to be suggesting that AT's symptoms were consistent with
AIDS, but rather that the presence of a sexually transmitted disease should
have alerted a competent practitioner to the possibility that the patient may
also have contracted HIV. Dr Gray's report does not
in terms address this
issue. He was not available for cross examination and accordingly the matter
was not taken further. I  take
Dr Gray to be asserting that as at 1992 in his
view a competent practitioner would not necessarily (in the sense of without
more)
have advised an HIV test in a case where a patient presented with
Hepatitis B. 
<P>

118   	The defendant's evidence is that as at the consultation
on 1 December 1992 he had regard to AT's history of viral illnesses
and the
combination of Hepatitis B with a urinary tract infection and that he
considered the possibility of HIV infection. The results
of the pyelogram
excluded other causes for the urinary tract infection leaving the defendant
with the suspicion that AT may have
engaged in anal intercourse. The defendant
was aware of anal intercourse as a risk factor for HIV.  In evidence the
defendant said
that he advised AT to have an HIV antibody test and that that
advice was in strong terms. If that were the case the defendant would
have
discharged his duty to AT (and BT). For the reasons already given above I do
not accept that the defendant advised AT in strong
terms to have an HIV test.

<P>

119   	If the defendant, mindful of the matters set out in
paragraph 118 above, suggested to AT that he consider an HIV test and
took the
matter no further when AT said that he did not think it was necessary, would
his conduct fall below the standard of ordinary
care and skill of a general
practitioner at that time? 
<P>

120   	Dr Law stated that patients often cannot accurately
assess their level of risk (report para 4 p.3). This seemed to me to
be an
unexceptional observation and I do not understand any of the expert witnesses
to be in disagreement with it.  Dr Furner drew
a distinction between
<i>suggesting</i> that a patient undergo an HIV test and<i> recommending</i>
that they do so.  In her report of 30 May 1997 Dr Furner said "when a patient
expresses the sentiment that HIV test is not required,
`as they do not feel it
is necessary' they should be adequately counselled as to the advantages of
having the test performed" (para
3 pp.1/2). Dr Fisher said it was necessary to
explore with a patient the reasons for the patient's refusal (T155). It should
be observed
that the defendant does not assert that AT refused to undergo a
test but rather that he said he did not think one was necessary.

<P>

121   	It seems to me that if on 1 December 1992 the defendant
did turn his mind to the real possibility that, contrary to his assertions,
AT
had engaged in homosexual relations involving anal intercourse and he knew him
to have contracted Hepatitis B and to have a history
of recurrent viral
illness, it was incumbent on him in the exercise of ordinary skill and care to
recommend that he undergo an HIV
antibody test. It was necessary to take time
to impress the need for this on AT and not to accept an initial expression of
disinclination.

<P>

122   	I do not take Professor Stewart to be of a contrary view.
In the event that a practitioner had a suspicion that his patient
was
homosexual or bisexual it would be appropriate to recommend an HIV test in the
presence of Hepatitis B (T191/2). Dr Gray's report
did not deal with this issue
since he was commenting on the defendant's statement which referred to his
acceptance of the patient's
reluctance to undertake an HIV test for the reason
that he had no risk factors. Dr Gray did not comment upon what might have been
the appropriate course had the defendant suspected that AT's sexual history
included acts of anal intercourse.
<P>

123   	As I have indicated I do not accept the defendant's
evidence as to the consultation on 1 December 1992. It flows from this
that I
do not accept the evidence that he was at the time of a mind to suspect that AT
had engaged in homosexual relations. I think
it more probable than not that the
defendant did not give consideration to this (or HIV infection) as a
possibility at the time.

<P>

124   	Accordingly, I turn now to a consideration of whether in
1992 a general practitioner of ordinary skill and care should have
considered a
diagnosis of HIV (and advised of the need for a test) in the case of a
heterosexual male who presented with Hepatitis
B presumed to have been sexually
acquired and who had a history of recurrent viral illnesses and a urinary tract
infection.
<P>

125   	Dr Fisher would say yes to the above question. By the
consultation on 1 December I understand Dr Law to also be of that view.
Unlike
Dr Fisher, I took Dr Law to be saying not that one would automatically test for
HIV in the presence of Hepatitis B but rather
that the presence of the latter
put the practitioner on notice of the need for further inquiry. A full sexual
history risk assessment
might in turn lead to the need for HIV testing. In this
case disclosure of the sexual contact with a prostitute would have done so.
Professor Stewart agreed sexual contact with a prostitute was a risk factor for
HIV. In any event by the December 1992 consultation
when AT presented with
signs of further viral illness it was necessary to consider a diagnosis of HIV
and to recommend that a test
be undertaken. This it seemed to me flowed from
the evidence of Drs Fisher and Law. 
<P>

126   	In evidence Professor Stewart was not prepared to say
that the defendant should have concluded that AT's Hepatitis B was
likely
sexually acquired. He acknowledged that the science would suggest that to be
the case but he was careful to distinguish between
"what the world knows and
what the individual practitioner knows" (T 185). In this case, of course, it is
accepted that the defendant
was of the view that AT's Hepatitis B was sexually
acquired. Thus it was not entirely clear that Professor Stewart in expressing
the opinion that in 1992 a reasonably competent general practitioner would not
have been expected to diagnose HIV infection in this
circumstance was taking
into account that AT was suffering from one sexually transmitted disease.
However, I note that Professor
Stewart was supplied with a copy of the
defendant's statement and  I understand the opinion expressed in the final
paragraph of his
report to be based upon a review of the whole of the material
supplied to him. I take him to be of the view that looking back to
the state of
knowledge in 1992 a reasonably competent practitioner would not have been
expected to diagnose HIV infection in the
presence of Hepatitis B presumed to
be sexually acquired.
<P>

127   	Professor Stewart was not at odds with Drs Fisher, Furner
or Law in considering the need to investigate for HIV in the presence
of a
sexually transmitted disease. The point of departure related to the presumed
knowledge of an ordinarily competent general practitioner
in 1992.  
<P>

128   	I understood Professor Stewart to be saying that a person
who presents with a sexually acquired disease ought to be counselled
to undergo
an HIV test but that in 1992 it was common for doctors in general practice not
to make this link in the absence of a risk
factor such as homosexuality or
intravenous drug use. He put it this way in the course of cross examination:
<P>

Q.  It follows necessarily that he has been infected by somebody who had the
disease.  Wouldn't you as a matter of simple commonsense
then want to ask
yourself the question well if the person has got that sexually transmitted
disease we had better make sure that
he hasn't got some other sexually
transmitted disease because he got it from a diseased person.  Isn't that a
perfectly reasonable
sensible thing to do?
<P>

A.  Yes, most of the other sexually transmitted diseases would have manifested
themselves with some clinical expression of it, and
the history taking would
have actually looked at those.  So what you are really asking me is shouldn't
you have also thought about
HIV in that circumstance.
<P>

Q.  Yes?
<P>

A. And again we have to cast our minds back to what was in the minds of people
in the early 90s.  Can I remind you that well into,
late into the 80s there
were still people who were publicly saying that heterosexual spread of this
virus did not occur except in
the presence of other genital lesions. You might
remember the grim reaper campaign which was around 1990 in which there was
great
criticism of the image being treated that everybody in the community was
at risk (T 190-191).
<P>

129   	It was Dr Fisher's view that initially (when HIV was
first recognised) the homosexual community was identified as the source
of
transmission of it and that later it came to be recognised that any sexual
activity, whether homosexual or heterosexual, could
promote the spread of it.
As at 1992 the latter recognition should have been in the minds of competent
general practitioners (T 157).
I accept that evidence. It was in accord with
the views of Dr Law. Professor Stewart's observations as to the impact of the
"Grim
Reaper" campaign in drawing to attention the potential for HIV to be
spread by heterosexual contact seem to me to be consistent with
this aspect of
Dr Fisher's opinion.  
<P>

130   	It was submitted that I would treat the evidence of Dr
Fisher with caution since it was urged he had adopted the role of
advocate for
the plaintiff's case. In this respect he was criticised for producing a
supplementary report attaching a copy of a journal
article which appeared in
the November 1991 issue of the <i>Medical Journal of Australia</i>. In cross
examination it emerged that the supplementary report was prepared at the
prompting of the plaintiff's solicitor who had
located the subject article,
copied it and sent it to Dr Fisher with the request that he submit a report
annexing it. 
<P>

131   	Central to Dr Fisher's opinion, as I understood it, was
that the presence of a disease believed to have been sexually transmitted
should as at 1992 have alerted a reasonably competent general practitioner to
the possibility of HIV infection. Hepatitis B was known
to be transmitted by
sexual contact. The article attached to the doctor's later report was titled:
"The failure of many to associate
HIV infection with other sexually transmitted
diseases". It was written by Professor Dwyer. It referred to the results of
research
carried out by Dr Gavin Hart published in the same issue of the
journal. Dr Fisher had not read the underlying article. In cross
examination he
agreed that Dr Hart's paper referred to named sexually transmitted diseases and
that Hepatitis B was not one. Thereafter
the following exchange occurred:
<P>

Q.  It can't be, can it, that Professor Dwyer's editorial provides any support
for a proposition that it was mandatory to test for
HIV in the presence of
hepatitis B in the period December 1991 through to January 1993, that's so,
isn't it?
<P>

A.  I don't agree with that proposition.
<P>

Q.  Point to me the words in Professor Dwyer's editorial that support that
proposition?
<P>

A.  There are no words in Professor Dwyer's proposition, but what he does say
is that people who have sexually transmitted diseases
should have HIV testing.
To point out a few words of the specific areas which were looked at in the
original article is really ignoring
the fact that sexually transmitted diseases
are sexually transmitted and it is - and the only way in which you can get
hepatitis
B is in the same way as you can get HIV, that is by intravenous drug
use or by sexual transmission (T 147).
<P>

132   	As I have already noted, it is clear that the defendant
proceeded upon the basis that AT's Hepatitis B infection was sexually
acquired
and that the likely cause was a `casual exploit'. 
<P>

133   	I accept Dr Fisher's evidence that the presence of
Hepatitis B (believed to have been sexually acquired) should have alerted
a
reasonably competent practitioner in 1992 to the possibility that his/her
patient had contracted other sexually transmitted diseases
including HIV.
However, it does not flow from that that the plaintiff has established that as
at the consultation on 1 February 1992
the defendant was negligent in failing
to recommend an HIV antibody test. I am mindful of Dr Law's recognition that
the demands of
general practice are such that on the first occasion a
practitioner may not (in 1992) have succeeded in obtaining a detailed sexual
history from the patient. Professor Stewart gave evidence that the referral of
a patient for an HIV test might itself be traumatic
from the patient's
perspective. I accept that this consideration may have inclined a competent
practitioner to see the need to take
a full history before making a decision
about referring the patient for an HIV antibody test. 
<P>

134   	I am satisified that as at 1 December 1992 when AT
returned to the defendant's rooms apparently suffering a further viral
illness,
having regard to the likelihood that the Hepatitis B was contracted as the
result of sexual contact and in the light of
the earlier history of viral
illnesses, a general practitioner exercising ordinary care and skill would have
considered a diagnosis
of HIV and counselled the need for an HIV antibody
test.
<P>

135   	I consider that as at 1 December 1992 the defendant was
negligent in failing to diagnose the possibility of HIV infection
and to
counsel AT as to the need to undergo an HIV antibody test.
<P>

<b>Causation</b>
<P>

136   	Did the defendant's negligent failure to diagnose AT's
HIV infection and/or to give adequate counselling and advice to AT
as to the
need for an HIV test cause or materially contribute to the contraction of that
virus by the plaintiff? A number of  factual
issues need to be determined in
order to answer this question.
<P>

<b>Had AT undergone an HIV antibody test in the period 1 February 1992 to 30
January 1993 would the test result have shown him to be
positive?</b>
<P>

137   	When the diagnosis of HIV was made in November  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1994%20ATs%20CD4" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1994 AT's
CD4</a> cell count was 180/ml.  It is not possible to deduce from the CD4 cell
count the time at which an individual contracted the virus.
 The rate of
decline in CD4 cells varies from one individual to another.  One can only in
any precise way determine the time of infection
by evidence of the change from
a negative HIV antibody test to a positive test.  Negative tests were not
available either with respect
to AT or BT.  Professor Stewart stated that a
reduction in CD4 positive T cells from a normal level of around 1000/ml to a
dangerously
low level of below 100/ml occurs over a period of about ten years
if the patient is untreated.  It is at that point that a high likelihood
of the
development of life-threatening, opportunistic infections is present.  
<P>

138   	Dr Adelstein gave evidence that it is difficult to reach
a CD4 cell count of 200/ml in less than three years from the date
of infection.
In Dr Adelstein's view it was likely that AT was infected with the virus some
time prior to January 1992.  
<P>

139   	On the evidence it is entirely possible that AT had been
HIV positive for a much longer period than the three years prior
to November
1994 referred to by Dr Adelstein in the course of his evidence.  That was,
having regard to the cell count, the minimum
period of probable infection in
the doctor's view.  I consider that AT had been infected with the virus not
later than November 1991.
 Having regard to the evidence of Dr Furner as to the
window period with respect to seroconversion and the detection of infection
I
consider that HIV antibody testing carried out on AT in the period from 1
February 1992 to 15 January 1993 would have revealed
his positive status.
<P>

<b>Did BT contract HIV as the result of sexual contact with AT and, if so,
when?  </b>
<P>

140   	BT gave evidence, which I accept, that she had only had
sexual intercourse with three persons as at the time she was living
in a
domestic relationship with AT.  She had sexual intercourse with the man who was
the father of her first child.  Subsequently,
she had married an Australian man
and lived for some years with him in Australia.  Sexual relations between the
two of them came
to an end in mid-1991.  She had not had sexual relations
thereafter until forming her relationship with AT.  In her home country
she
had, apart from the relationship with the father of her first child, engaged in
intimate contact with two young men falling short
of sexual intercourse.  The
latter explains the reference in one of the histories to her having five sexual
partners.  It appears
that practitioners working in the area of sexual health
include in a sexual history risk assessment episodes of intimate contact
falling short of intercourse (T 56). 
<P>

141   	BT had no history of risk behaviour in terms of
contracting HIV. She commenced a sexual relationship around Easter 1992 with
a
man who at that time was HIV positive. I accept that BT became infected with
HIV in consequence of sexual contact with AT. It was
not submitted that I would
find otherwise.  
<P>

142   	For the reasons explained by Professor Stewart in his
report it is not possible to say with certainty when BT contracted
the virus.
Her antibody positive status was determined on 8 March 1994.  
<P>

143   	On 22 February 1993, BT saw Dr Salgo at a time when she
had a high fever and a sore throat.  At that time she gave an account
of having
had the fever for "a few days".  It was her evidence that she had not
previously experienced flu or a flu-like illness.
 Dr Furner noted that the
history given to her of the illness in February 1993, shortly described as a
"severe flu-like illness",
 was a "probable seroconversion illness" (T 77).  In
this regard the doctor appears to have considered as significant the
circumstance
that BT had not experienced other flu-like illnesses to this
degree on any other occasion.  At the time of expressing the view that
the
February 1993 history was of a probable seroconversion illness Dr Furner had
access to BT's CD4 cell count from the initial occasion
in March 1994 and on
subsequent testing.  The opinion was expressed in a report of 4 July 1996.  
<P>

144   	Dr Adelstein said that seroconversion is an illness.
When a person is infected with HIV it is the illness associated with
their move
from the negative antibody status to the positive status.  It is itself a
positive infection and is associated with the
change in status.  He was asked
if there were any classic or common symptoms to seroconversion illness.  He
explained that it has
symptoms similar to any other viral infection but that it
"... is often described as the worst viral infection anybody has had. 
It can
be associated with swelling glands, but it frequently is more severe than your
average flu, although it is often confused
with other viral infections" (T 27).

<P>

145   	In evidence Dr Furner made reference to the difficulties
in diagnosing seroconversion illness arising out of the fact that
it can mimic
other illnesses, particularly influenza (T 64).
<P>

146   	I consider that the illness suffered by BT for which she
saw Dr Salgo on 22 February 1993 was a seroconversion illness. 
Dr Adelstein
was asked if there is a commonly understood period between infection and
seroconversion.  He said that it is usually
between seven days and twenty-one
days, somewhere around that range.  
<P>

147   	Dr Furner gave evidence that a review of the literature
indicates the time from exposure to HIV to the onset of acute clinical
illness
(I took this to be a reference to the seroconversion illness) is typically two
to four weeks although the range would be
six days to six weeks (T 63).  
<P>

148   	It should be noted that not every person who contracts
HIV undergoes a seroconversion illness. 
<P>

149   	At the time of consulting Dr Salgo, BT had been
experiencing flu-type symptoms for "a few days".  This might take the onset
of
the illness back to, say, 18 February 1993.  That would mean, on Dr Adelstein's
evidence, that the probability is that BT contracted
the virus some time
between 28 January and around 11 February 1993.  On Dr Furner's account that
the typical interval between infection
and seroconversion is two to four weeks,
the date of infection might be taken back to around 22 January 1993.  It is to
be remembered
that she put the range as being between six days to six weeks.
The date of infection could have been as early as 7 January 1993.
 The latter
view seems unlikely having regard to Dr Furner's review of the literature and
Dr Adelstein's evidence.  Professor Stewart
noted that the interval of six to
eight weeks between the date when AT was reported to have visited a prostitute
and the date of
his febrile illness recorded in the defendant's notes was "an
unusually long incubation period".  The probability in my view is that
BT
contracted the virus on a date on or after 21 January 1993. 
<P>

<b>Would AT have undergone an HIV test if counselled to do so?</b>
<P>

150   	The defendant could not compel AT to undergo an HIV
antibody test.  A sample of AT's blood for the purpose of HIV antibody
testing
could only be taken with AT's consent. 
<P>

151   	Dr Law agreed  that individuals who do not perceive
themselves to have a likelihood of being infected are more likely to
be
reluctant to undergo testing (T49).  
<P>

152   	In Dr Furner's experience 95% of patients properly
counselled will undergo an HIV antibody test.  
<P>

153   	Dr Fisher was cross-examined concerning this aspect
(T.154):
<P>

"Q.  Now I gather your experience as a general practitioner would tell you that
sometimes, notwithstanding your best efforts, patients
will not agree to
undertake particular tests?
<P>

A.  Yes.  There is that possibility, yes.
<P>

Q.  And particularly so if it is something like HIV and the patient has a
perception that they are at low risk of acquiring the
HIV?
<P>

A.  That is true.  I must say that in my experience I don't have a lot of
problem with people who deny or who refuse to have HIV
tests, but that is just
my own experience.
<P>

Q.  Nevertheless you are aware, aren't you, it is certainly well published,
that often notwithstanding counselling, people will
still refuse to undertake
testing?
<P>

A.  Yes, at times.  
<P>

Q.  And you would associate that refusal with a well-known and commonly
observed factor in general practice, of a denial mechanism,
use of a denial
mechanism by a patient?
<P>

A.  Yes, well that needs to be explored, of course.  I agree with your
proposition that it is a denial mechanism, but often it is
the fear of truth or
the fear of the unknown which governs it, and I believe that a special time
should be devoted to people like
that in order to ensure that they are well
informed.  
<P>

Q.  And sometimes that special time works and sometimes that special time
doesn't?
<P>

A.  Occasionally it doesn't, yes.  
<P>

Q.  You said that from time to time, although not often in your experience,
patients will refuse to have an HIV test notwithstanding
counselling and
advice?
<P>

A.  That's right, yes."
<P>

154   	Neither Professor Stewart nor Dr Gray expressed an
opinion on this aspect.
<P>

155   	After BT learned of her own positive HIV status she
suggested to AT that he undertake an HIV antibody test:  
<P>

"Q.  Did you not repeatedly tell AT that he should ask his doctor to do a HIV
test on him and he kept reassuring that this was not
necessary?
<P>

A.  I did not say repeatedly, but I remember I ask him once but when I ask him
that question I said, `What about second opinion
from a different doctor or
having HIV test?'  But he said, `Okay, I'll try'.  That's all.  But not I been
asking him many times about
it because - 
<P>

Q.  You certainly asked AT to go and have a HIV test, didn't you?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  After you learned you were HIV positive?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q.  He told you when you asked him that he did not think it was necessary,
didn't he?
<P>

A.  He doesn't say that it was necessary.  He did not say that word.  He said
he will go and see a different doctor." (T 128C)
<P>

156   	She was further examined on this topic and said:
<P>

"Q.  You wanted your husband AT to have a HIV test?
<P>

A.  Yes, and he said he wouldn't have one.  He said he will go and ask a
doctor, a different doctor.
<P>

Q.  Which doctor?
<P>

A.  I don't know.  Because when I ask him, `What about have a HIV test?' he
said, `Okay, I will find a second opinion.  I will get
- I will try.  I will
try and get a test." (T 132).
<P>

157   	The conversation in which BT suggested to AT that he
might undergo an HIV antibody test must have taken place on a date some
time
after 8 March 1994.  That was the date on which BT was advised of her own
positive HIV status.  At that date AT was no longer
a patient of the defendant.
It was BT's evidence that on occasions AT told her he had consulted Dr Salgo.
BT gave an account of one
occasion when she and AT jointly attended Dr Salgo.
As I understood her evidence this was an occasion when she went to see Dr
Salgo,
accompanied by AT,  in connection with her own health problems.  She
went on to explain that they had talked to Dr Salgo about problems
he, AT, was
having in connection with his Hepatitis (T 128B).  Dr Salgo's notes suggest
this consultation took place on 9 July 1994.
 He records a discussion
concerning AT for one hour concerning problems related to "Hep B cirrhosis".
It was BT's evidence that it
was on the occasion of this consultation that she
and AT had "decided to have a second opinion" (T 128B).  
<P>

158   	It appears that following the 9 July 1994 consultation
with Dr Salgo BT and AT spoke of the need for AT to obtain a second
opinion.
In the course of this discussion BT suggested that AT might have an HIV test.
AT's response appears to have been to indicate
that he would obtain a second
opinion.  The evidence does not establish that he did so.  
<P>

159   	The defendant submits that AT was not a person who
exhibited concern for his health and wellbeing. In this respect reference
is
made to the final consultation at which the defendant referred AT to Dr Bye,
Gastroenerologist. At this time AT had been informed
he had cirrhosis of the
liver. There is no evidence that AT followed up on that referral. Ultimately
during 1994 the evidence shows
he was attending Dr Salgo and that he did attend
for consultations with specialists in connection with his liver condition.
However,
there was an interval of approximately one year before this occurred.
Why would I consider that a man who did not pursue a referral
to a specialist
having been told he had cirrhosis would bother to follow up a recommendation
that he have an HIV test?
<P>

160   	The submission that AT was careless as to his health and
generally a non- compliant patient needs to be evaluated, in part,
by reference
to the evidence as to his attendances both on the defendant and his subsequent
general practitioner, Dr Salgo. AT was
the defendant's patient for a period of
fourteen months. During this time he attended for consultations with the
defendant on eleven
occasions. On the second visit the defendant arranged for a
full blood count, liver function test and various other tests. AT returned
twice in the next week in order to learn the results of the tests. On the
latter of those visits, namely 1 February, it appears that
the defendant
ordered further tests and again asked AT to return to see the results of them.

<P>

161   	On 10 February AT returned to see the defendant. That was
the occasion when AT was concerned about a kidney stone. He asked
for a
referral in order to have it removed. The defendant considered that was not
necessary and so advised AT. He told AT to return
in two weeks time. AT
returned a little over three weeks later although it appears his reason for
seeing the defendant on that occasion
may have been to obtain a medical
certificate (he had been off work the previous week with fever, chills, aches
and pains). The defendant
told AT to return in two weeks time. AT complied with
that request and returned for a further consultation even though at that time
(19 March 1992) he was feeling well. The defendant ordered further tests. It
does not appear that AT returned to learn the results
of the tests nor does the
defendant suggest he instructed him to do so. However, it is clear that AT
submitted to the tests since
the defendant makes reference to receiving the
results of them. 
<P>

162   	On 1 December 1992 when AT again consulted the defendant
further tests were ordered. On 15 January 1993 AT was complaining,
among other
things, of abdominal pain and constipation. He was referred for a barium enema.
It is clear that AT followed up on that
referral since the results (showing
spleenomegaly) were available at his next consultation on 22 January. On that
occasion the defendant
arrange for a CAT scan to investigate the spleenomegaly
further. Again, it is clear that AT followed up that referral.
<P>

163   	The defendant last saw AT on 30 January 1993. He says
that on that occasion the CAT scan was suggestive of cirrhosis of the
liver
with portal hypertension and that he referred AT to Dr Bye for further
management. AT's account is contained in paragraph 10
of his affidavit:
<P>

"In early 1993, Dr Oei told me I had cirrhosis of the liver. He told me he was
satisfied, however, that the hepatitis condition
was under control and I
accepted this although my energy levels were still below normal".        
<P>

164   	AT gives no account of the referral to Dr Bye or the
reason why he did not follow it up. The defendant's account of having
made such
a referral was not the subject of challenge. There is no evidence as to the
receipt of any further medical advice or treatment
by AT until 27 October 1993
when he attended on Dr Salgo to undergo an eye test to obtain a tourist bus
driver's licence. 
<P>

165   	On 5 February 1994, AT consulted Dr Salgo complaining of
afternoon tiredness and of being unwell. Dr Salgo appears to have
had access to
the results of AT's blood tests taken on earlier occasions at this
consultation. Dr Salgo saw AT three days later and
referred him to Dr Selby, a
specialist, that afternoon. It appears clear that AT followed up on that
referral. Throughout 1994 and
continuing up until his admission to Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital in February 1995 AT appears to have seen Dr Salgo regularly. It
is also clear that he saw Dr Selby on a number of occasions between February
and October 1994. This appears from the references in
Dr Salgo's notes to
progress reports from Dr Selby. In November 1994, AT saw Dr Koorey, another
specialist. Dr Salgo's notes are
consistent with a view that AT was attending
to his health concerns as directed. It is clear both that Dr Salgo took blood
from AT
for test purposes and that he had submitted to tests as required by Dr
Selby (notes of 7 October 1994 refer to letter from Dr Selby
advising of
results of further liver function tests).
<P>

166   	On the evidence as to attendances on both the defendant
and Dr Salgo it seems that AT was generally a compliant patient.

<P>

167   	It happens, on occasions, that patients will refuse an
HIV test after receiving competent advice.  That, on the expert evidence
appears a relatively unusual occurrence:  Dr Furner report of 30/5/97 para 2
p.1; Dr Fisher at T 154.  AT was willing to tell Dr
Selby that he had had a
sexual encounter with a Thai prostitute.  As I have noted, he told BT about
this episode on the occasion
of their first meeting.  Although he did not, in
terms, refer to relations with a prostitute in his discussion with the
defendant
he did make reference to "casual exploits".  These considerations do
not lead me to think that AT was likely to be the relatively
unusual patient in
denial who would steadfastly refuse testing even when the clear desirability of
it was pointed out to him. 
<P>

168   	I do not consider the fact that BT suggested to AT that
he have an HIV test (in the course of a conversation relating  to
his health
status as he understood it, namely, that he was suffering from Hepatitis B and
cirrhosis of the liver) is a useful guide
to what AT might have done had the
defendant adequately counselled him to undergo such a test as at December 1992.
Any suggestion
by BT who is medically untrained would not have served to bring
home to AT the desirability of undertaking HIV antibody testing.
<P>

169   	In November 1994 when Dr Koorey suggested that AT undergo
an HIV antibody test he did so. 
<P>

170   	I  consider that AT would have undertaken an HIV antibody
test in 1992 had he been advised by the defendant that he should
do so.
<P>

<b>Would AT have taken appropriate steps to protect BT from contracting HIV
from him?</b>
<P>

171   	I infer from the circumstances in which AT and BT met (in
response to an advertisement placed in a newspaper) that both were
interested
in meeting a person of the opposite sex with whom they might be compatible with
a view to a relationship including a sexual
relationship.  In this regard AT's
hesitancy, after a number of outings, to permit a relationship to develop with
a woman who already
had a child seems an indicator that he was looking to meet
a woman who met his criteria for an ongoing relationship.  
<P>

172   	At their initial meeting AT disclosed both that he was
suffering from Hepatitis B and that he had engaged in sexual relations
with a
prostitute in a brothel.  He also appears to have discussed the break-up of his
earlier marriage.  It is not clear to me that
his reason for disclosing his
Hepatitis condition was because of an awareness that it was sexually
transmissible and that a prospective
sexual partner should be on notice of that
fact.  BT's evidence in this regard is unclear.  She said that she and AT had
discussed
the risk of sexual transmission of Hepatitis B but that there was
"[n]ot much discussion when I first met him, but just when I was
living with
him" (T 126).  Elsewhere, in the course of her evidence, she said that the two
of them had not discussed the possibility
of catching Hepatitis B through
sexual intercourse in the period between their first meeting until AT told her
he was HIV positive
(T 132).  The cross-examiner came back to this topic (T137)
and BT agreed both that Dr Subbamma had told her of the risk of contracting
Hepatitis B through unprotected intercourse and that she had discussed that
with AT during the six month period that she was undergoing
her vaccinations
for Hepatitis B.  Further, it was BT's evidence that they used condoms when AT
was very sick and on occasions when
he was complaining of not feeling well.
When asked why condoms were used on such occasions she replied, "Because we
said we have
to protect each other.  He said that" (T 171).  
<P>

173   	When, on one occasion, BT appeared to be denying that
there had been any discussion with AT about the possibility of Hepatitis
B
being sexually transmitted, I considered that she was confused.  Having regard
to the whole of her evidence it seems to me that
she was maintaining that there
had been such discussions.  Those discussions took place after she and AT
commenced living together
in September 1992.  At the time of those discussions
BT had been advised about the risk of sexual transmission of Hepatitis B by
her
own doctor.  As I have already indicated, I accept that when the defendant
informed AT that he was suffering from Hepatitis B
and noted (as AT confirmed
that he did) that the likely source of transmission was sexual intercourse, the
defendant gave him pamphlets
including one relating to safe sex and that AT
brushed the matter off saying something to the effect that he would not have
the energy
for sex.  
<P>

174   	AT and BT did not engage in sexual relations for some
time following their initial meeting.  They went out together on a
number of
occasions prior to any intimate contact.  When they travelled together to Young
during the Easter holidays in 1992 they
did not have sexual relations on the
first day.  AT was feeling unwell.  They had intercourse on the second day, for
the first time,
at a time when AT was feeling better.  Thereafter they had
sexual relations on three or four occasions between Easter and June of
1992.
On those occasions no condom was used.  BT had not at that time been counselled
by Dr. Subbamma in relation to the risk of
Hepatitis B infection.  Such advice
as the defendant had given to AT had not resulted in precautions being taken.
Even after BT was
advised of the risks by Dr Subbamma, and before she had
completed her course of Hepatitis B vaccinations, the couple did not always
use
condoms (T 126).  Condoms were used on occasions when AT was not feeling well.
When AT was feeling well, but during the period
prior to January 1993 when BT
received her final injection to immunise her against Hepatitis B, they had
sexual relations without
condoms.  BT explained it in this way:
<P>

"If I didn't use condoms, because he was very active and energetic on the
certain times when we are not using condoms, well what
I understand, for the
condom is because we do some time, our sexual thing is not in the bedroom" (T
171).  
<P>

I took this to mean that on occasions when AT was feeling well and the couple
engaged in sexual relations in spontaneous circumstances
they did not take heed
of the warning to use condoms to protect BT from the possible contraction of
Hepatitis B.
<P>

175   	It should be noted that in his affidavit AT stated that
it was not until mid-1994 that Dr Salgo advised him and his wife
that Hepatitis
B could be transmitted by unprotected sexual intercourse and that since that
time they had not engaged in sexual intercourse.
 I do not accept that account.
As I have already noted, BT was aware in mid-1993 of the risks of sexual
transmission of Hepatitis
B and I am satisfied that she discussed that matter
with AT.  This was a year before the joint consultation with Dr Salgo.  
<P>

176   	BT states that she and AT stopped having sexual
intercourse after he was diagnosed as HIV positive.  That was a matter of
weeks
before his admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on the last occasion.
Prior to that in the period between March and late
November 1994 the two
engaged in sexual relations.  At that time BT knew that she was HIV positive.
She said that they used condoms
on those occasions because of her awareness
that she was already sick with HIV.  She insisted that they had always used
condoms after
she found out her status.  
<P>

177   	On behalf of the defendant, among other things, it was
submitted that I would take into account the circumstance that BT
had failed to
disclose her HIV positive status to her husband and had continued to have sex
with him following the discovery of it.
 Those circumstances do not seem to me
to bear relevantly on a consideration of the causation issues raised by BT's
claim.  I should
observe that I accept that BT was sure in her own mind that
the source of the infection with HIV in her case was AT.  I consider
that she
blamed AT for infecting her and had, as her primary focus, concern for the
future well-being and financial security of her
son.  She did not disclose her
status to AT because she feared he may not marry her.  Given her confidence
that he was the source
of her infection, I do not consider much turns on this
aspect.
<P>

178   	Given the couple's imperfect understanding of safe sex
practices and their apparent willingness to engage in intercourse
in
circumstances which put BT at risk of infection with Hepatitis B, might it be
said that, had AT known of his status, they would
have continued, on occasions,
to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse?  In my view they would not have
done so.  Hepatitis B,
as things turn out, is far more readily transmitted by
sexual contact than HIV.  It is a debilitating and dangerous condition.
However,
I do not think it reasonable to assume that the same fear attended the
risk of contracting Hepatitis B in 1992 and 1993 as attended
the risk of
contracting HIV.  
<P>

179   	AT asserted in his affidavit that, had he been aware of
his HIV positive status, he would not have had unprotected sexual
intercourse
with his wife. Little, if any, weight can be accorded to this assertion for the
reasons explained by Kirby P in <b>Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20553" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 553</a> at 560. 
<P>

180   	AT was aware that his Hepatitis B had likely been
contracted as the result of sexual contact. He appears to have had some
understanding that the use of  condoms can prevent the spread of sexually
transmitted disease. Yet the couple did not always use
condoms during
intercourse. AT's understanding of safe sex practice was limited. It is to be
borne in mind that he did not know he
was infected with HIV. Drs Fisher and Law
were of the opinion that providing a patient with pamphlets was not a
sufficient means
of discharging the practitioner's obligation to advise as to
safe sex practices. Dr Law emphasised that the giving of pamphlets is
not a
substitute for the supply of oral information weighted to the patient's
situation (report p.2). In evidence she referred to
the need to ensure a
patient understands the risks and the means of the practitioner checking that
this is so (T 51). 
<P>

181   	Had AT known he was HIV positive and had he received
adequate counselling concerning the transmission of HIV and safe sex
practices
would he have taken measures to protect BT from risk of infection? The expert
evidence strongly suggests that he would.
Dr Furner, whose expertise in the
area of dealing with people who are HIV positive I accept without reservation,
stated that it is
generally accepted that a very high percentage of persons (of
any sexual orientation) if adequately counselled will both notify their
sexual
partner and change their sexual practices so as not to place their sexual
partner at risk.
<P>

182   	I consider that BT became infected with HIV in January or
February of 1993. By that time the couple were living together
in a domestic
relationship and, whatever their difficulties, had developed affection for one
another.  BT's evidence of AT's response
when he first became aware of his own
HIV status speaks of that. In the light of the expert evidence and having
regard to the circumstance
that AT and BT were in a stable relationship, I
accept that AT would not have engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse with BT
had
he been aware of his HIV status.  
<P>

183   	I therefore find that had AT been appropriately
counselled as at December 1992 he would have undergone an HIV antibody test.
Such a test would have shown he had contracted HIV. Proper advice would have
brought home to him the need to protect his partner
from risk of infections and
the means to do so. The couple would not have engaged in unprotected sexual
relations thereafter. In
the event, unaware of his HIV condition on an occasion
between late January and mid February 1993, the couple engaged in unprotected
sexual intercourse and BT thereby contracted HIV. The defendant's negligent
failure to properly advise AT with respect to a possible
diagnosis of HIV and
the need for an antibody test materially contributed to the plaintiff's
infection with the virus.
<P>

184   	Accordingly there will be a verdict and judgement for the
plaintiff in respect of her personal claim. 
<P>

<b>The Claim Made on Behalf of AT's Estate </b>
<P>

185   	The negligence relied on in support of the claim brought
on behalf of the estate of AT is the same as that pleaded in respect
of the
palintiff's personal claim.
<P>

186   	The damages claimed on behalf of the estate of AT are for
emotional distress, anxiety, depression and nervous shock. 
<P>

187   	The claim in respect of general damages made on behalf of
the estate of AT survives the death of AT given that his death
is not said to
have been caused by the tort complained of:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pha1991126/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 2(2)(d)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1944404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a></b> 1944.
<P>

188   	The claim made on behalf of the estate of AT is as to the
injury he suffered, in the way of depression and/or nervous shock,
on learning
that he had unwittingly infected his wife with HIV.  No evidence was led to
suggest that AT's reaction was other than
a normal grief reaction in all the
circumstances.  There was no expert evidence that AT had sustained any
recognisable psychiatric
injury.  The only evidence touching on this issue was
the statement in the affidavit sworn by AT on 23 February 1995:  "I have been
deeply depressed at the thought of having infected my wife with this deadly
virus".  BT described AT's evident concern for her welfare
when he became aware
of his HIV status.  He apologised to her and became more affectionate and he
told her, for the first time, that
he loved her.  BT was asked about her
observations of her husband's mood after the occasion when he accompanied her
to Dr Salgo's
clinic when he learned that she, too, was HIV positive.  She
said:
<P>

"He just have, like have a deep breathing like, breathing like sometime you
can't say it in words any more and every time he bumped
me in the house he just
give me a big hug and that's it, we can't say a word if we cannot ..." (T
115).
<P>

BT went on to describe how AT had told her that they had to look after one
another and help one another from there on.  BT's evidence
concerning AT's mood
and response to learning of his own HIV status and then being made aware of
BT's HIV status is consistent with
a view that he sincerely cared for her.  No
doubt he experienced feelings of sorrow and distress when he became aware of
his wife's
condition.  The evidence does not disclose an injury or illness for
which damages are recoverable:  <b>Jaensch v Coffey</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155 CLR 549</a>;

<P>

189   	In the light of the above findings there must be a
verdict for the defendant in respect of the claim brought on behalf of
the
estate of AT. 
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

190   	The parties were in substantial agreement as to the
appropriate measure of damages with respect to the plaintiff, BT's, claim
for
pecuniary loss. That agreement was set out in a schedule the relevant portions
of which are reproduced below. 
<P>

191   	I was informed that the figure nominated in the schedule
for future medication was a conditional one. As at present the plaintiff
is not
incurring significant expense in respect of medication. Once she obtains
judgment she will be required to pay the commercial
cost of pharmaceuticals. Mr
Menzies QC, who appears for the plaintiff, indicated that he may wish to lead
evidence on this aspect
in the event that the parties were not able to reach
agreement on an appropriate figure as to the costs of future medication. I have
not been advised that the parties have reached any such agreement. Accordingly
I will hear submissions and receive any further evidence
on this issue prior to
judgement being entered.  
<P>

<b>Schedule </b>

<P>

	less 35% keep				$  67,781	$125,881
<P>

192   	The agreement with respect to the pecuniary loss items
did not include interest with respect both to past economic loss (item
2) and
past care (item 3). This matter was drawn to my attention. However, it was not
suggested that there was any issue as between
the parties concerning it. I
propose allowing the sum of $ 9,300 by way of interest calculated in accordance
with half the rate as
specified in Schedule J for the period 28/2/97 to the
date of judgement. 
<P>

			
<P>

193   	This leaves a consideration of the question of general
damages.  I consider that the plaintiff is entitled to a significant
award with
respect to general damages.  She was aged 33 years when she learned that she
had contracted HIV. Despite some improvement
in the outlook for those suffering
from HIV/AIDS the prognosis for BT remains guarded. Her life expectancy is
agreed to be some ten
to eleven years from the date of diagnosis. She faces
spending that relatively lengthy period both knowing of her condition and its
probable unpleasant course. 
<P>

194   	BT's pain and suffering to date has been considerable.
She has experienced significant AIDS related conditions. In January
1997 she
suffered weight loss, diarrhoea, severe fatigue, oral candidiasis and hair
loss. As at that time she had a low CD4 cell
count indicative of a severe
degree of immunosuppression. She was commenced on antiretroviral therapy. In
early 1997 her prognosis
was said to be extremely uncertain and there were
fears that she would progress to AIDS within two years. At that time BT
appeared
not to be responding to treatment. She continued to suffer from
diarrhoea and developed a facial rash together with other side effects
of the
drug therapy. She experienced extreme emotional distress in relation to the
rapid progress of her illness and the associated
poor quality of life.  In May
1997 she was commenced on anti-depressant medication. 
<P>

195   	The position has since improved in that BT has responded
to the antiretroviral therapy and her CD4 cell count has increased.
However,
she nonetheless had what Dr Cooper describes as a "stormy course" in the year
preceding this trial. 
<P>

196   	I consider an appropriate award of general damages to
compensate BT for her pain and suffering, loss of amenities and loss
of
expectation of life to be $160,000. I apportion this 35% as to the past and 65%
as to future loss. 
<P>

197   	In the light of the foregoing my orders are: 
<P>

(1)	Verdict and judgment for the defendant in respect of the claim brought by
the plaintiff in her capacity as administratrix of
the estate of AT. 
<P>

(2)	Verdict for the plaintiff in respect of her personal claim against the
defendant, judgment will be given in the sum of $703,414.00
together with such
additional sum, representing future medication costs and interest on past non
economic loss, as may be agreed
or determined.
<P>

(3)	The defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of her personal action.
<P>

I will hear any evidence and submissions from the parties on the question of
the quantum of damages for future medication costs
and the date from which
interest is to commence in relation to past non-economic loss. In the event the
parties are able to reach
agreement as to these matters short minutes may be
brought in and judgment entered in accordance with these reasons.
