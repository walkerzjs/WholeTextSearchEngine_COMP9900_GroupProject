JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff David Miller, who was formerly called David Hoare,
brought these proceedings against the defendant,
James Shea, claiming damages
for alleged breaches of an oral agreement allegedly made in June or July 1990
between the plaintiff
and the defendant or, alternatively, (as a result of a
late amendment of the statement of claim which I allowed) between the plaintiff
and his wife, Wendy Miller, of the one part and the defendant of the other
part.  The agreement alleged (regardless of whether Wendy
Miller was a party to
the agreement) was that the parties would set up a business of providing
sanitary services in women's toilets,
that is of providing bins for the
disposal of used sanitary dressings; that a company to be known as Ladycare
Services Pty Limited
("Ladycare Services") would be incorporated to carry on
the business; that initially the defendant would own 100 per cent of the
shares
in the company but that after six months the defendant would transfer to the
plaintiff 40 per cent of the shares in the company;
that the defendant would
provide such financial assistance as was required to make the business
operational in its early stages;
that the plaintiff, who had previous
experience in this type of business, would provide advice; and that the
plaintiff's wife Wendy
Miller, who is a sister of the defendant, would be paid
$5,000 per month as a consultancy fee for the first twelve months, the fee
being paid initially by the defendant and then by the company.  
<P>

2	The company Ladycare Services Pty Limited was incorporated on 4 September
1990 and on 8 October 1990 it commenced carrying on
the business of providing
sanitary services.  The defendant or a company or companies controlled by the
defendant became the owner
of 100 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services.
The plaintiff alleged in the amended statement of claim that after six months
had elapsed, that is after about March 1991, the original agreement was varied,
so as to permit the transferring to Wendy Miller
of the shares in Ladycare
Services which were transferable to the plaintiff.
<P>

3	The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had committed the following breaches
of the agreement.
<P>

1.	Although the defendant had on a single occasion in November 1990 paid the
sum of $5,000 to the plaintiff's wife, the defendant
had subsequently failed to
pay the sum of $5,000 each month to the plaintiff's wife.
<P>

2.	In March 1991, after six months had elapsed, the defendant failed to
transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
either to the plaintiff
or his wife and the defendant subsequently continued to fail to perform this
promise.
<P>

4	In his defence the defendant made inter alia the following allegations.  The
defendant accepted that an agreement had been entered
into in about June or
July 1990 but said that the agreement was between the defendant and Wendy
Miller and that David Miller had
not been a party to the agreement.  Under the
agreement the defendant agreed to provide capital for Ladycare Services, both
the capital
required for setting up the business and the initial working
capital, such capital being referred to in the defendant's defence as
"the
initial capital injection".  Under the agreement Mr Shea or a company
associated with him was to remain the owner of all the
shares in Ladycare
Services, until the business of Ladycare Services had made sufficient profit to
be able to repay the initial capital
injection to Mr Shea from reserves which
in Mr Shea's opinion were not required for the company's purposes (the
attaining of such
a position by Ladycare Services was described as the
attaining of "profit maturity").  Only if Ladycare Services attained profit
maturity and repaid Mr Shea the initial capital injection, would Mr Shea be
obliged to cause 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare
Services to be
transferred and those shares were to be transferred to Mrs Miller and not the
plaintiff.  Mr Shea agreed to pay Mrs
Miller $5,000 on one occasion only and
did not agree to make periodical payments of $5,000 a month to Mrs Miller.
<P>

The defendant then alleged in his defence that the amount of the initial
capital injection he had made into Ladycare Services was
$136,607.  He also
said that he had paid Mrs Miller an amount of $5,000 and that he had, without
obligation, paid Mrs Miller other
sums totalling $23,769.  The defendant
alleged that in 1991 disputes arose between the plaintiff and Wendy Miller on
the one side
and the defendant on the other.  On 27 June 1991 the plaintiff,
with the consent of the defendant, ceased to have any further involvement
in
the business of Ladycare Services.  By August 1991 Ladycare Services had not
attained a state of profit maturity.  Pursuant to
a deed dated 16 August 1991
made between the plaintiff and Mrs Miller on the one side and the defendant on
the other side, the defendant
paid the sum of $25,000 and David Miller and
Wendy Miller released all claims they might have against the defendant.
<P>

5	By his reply the plaintiff alleged in relation to the deed of release of 16
August 1991:-
<P>

6	(i) That on its true construction it was only the plaintiff's wife Wendy
Miller who released claims against the defendant and
the plaintiff himself had
not by the deed released claims which he had against the defendant.
<P>

7	(ii) The deed was vitiated by economic duress and unconscionable conduct on
the part of the defendant.  Particulars of this allegation
were included in the
reply.  In summary, it was alleged that the plaintiff and his wife were in dire
financial straits, that they
needed $25,000 to pay immediate debts, that the
defendant knew that the plaintiff and his wife were in dire financial straits,
that
the defendant had not paid all the instalments of $5,000 which he had
promised to pay to Mrs Miller, that the plaintiff and his wife
had been
confronted by the defendant with the deed of release which they had not seen
before, that the plaintiff and his wife were
presented with an ultimatum by the
defendant that they had to sign the deed of release or not receive the sum of
$25,000, that the
plaintiff and his wife had no opportunity of negotiating or
of obtaining legal advice and that the plaintiff had signed the deed
of release
"under protest".
<P>

8	From the above examination of the pleadings in the proceedings, it can be
seen that it was not in dispute that an oral agreement
was entered into in June
or July 1990 for the setting up of a business, that the company Ladycare
Services was set up to carry on
the agreed type of business and that initially
the defendant or a company associated with the defendant owned 100 per cent of
the
shares in Ladycare Services.  Issues arising from the pleadings include the
following:-
<P>

9	1.	Who were the parties to the agreement.  It is clear that the party on one
side of the agreement was the defendant James Shea.
 However, the plaintiff
alleged that the party or parties of the other part were either himself or
himself and his wife Wendy Miller,
whereas the defendant alleged that the other
party to the agreement was only his sister Wendy Miller.
<P>

10	2.	To whom were 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services to be
transferred.  The plaintiff alleged that under the original
agreement 40 per
cent of the shares in Ladycare Services were to be transferred to him and that
under the variation to the agreement
40 per cent of the shares were to be
transferred either to him or to his wife.  The defendant alleged that the
agreement always was
that the person who was to receive 40 per cent of the
shares was Mrs Miller.
<P>

11	3. To whom was the promise made by the defendant to transfer 40 per cent of
the shares and could the promise be enforced by the
sole plaintiff, Mr
Miller.
<P>

12	4.	What were the conditions which had to be fulfilled before an obligation
arose to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare
Services and had those
conditions been fulfilled.  The plaintiff alleged that 40 per cent of the
shares were to be transferred after
the expiration of six months, it being
somewhat unclear whether this period of six months was to be reckoned from the
date Ladycare
Services commenced carrying on business (8 October 1990) or from
the date of the termination of the plaintiff's employment by Rentokil
Pty
Limited (apparently some date in September 1990).  However, both of these dates
were close together and nothing turns on when
the period of six months would
have commenced to run.  The defendant, on the other hand, alleged that the
obligation to transfer
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services did not
arise until after Ladycare Services had attained profit maturity and had repaid
to the defendant out of reserves the full amount of the initial capital
injection.
<P>

13	5.	On a true construction of the deed of release, did the deed of release
bar claims only by Wendy Miller(as alleged by the plaintiff)
or claims by both
David Miller and Wendy Miller (as alleged by the defendant).
<P>

14	6.	Was the deed of release "vitiated" by economic duress and unconscionable
conduct on the part of the defendant.
<P>

15	7.	If an obligation on the defendant to transfer 40 per cent of the shares
in Ladycare Services had crystallised and had not
been performed and damages
amounting to the value of 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services were
to be assessed, should the
value of the shares be determined as at the date of
the breach (which on the plaintiff's case was in about April 1991) or as of now
and what, at the appropriate time, was the value of 40 per cent of the shares
in Ladycare Services.
<P>

16	8.	Had the defendant promised to make monthly payments of $5,000 for twelve
months (as alleged by the plaintiff) or had the defendant
promised only to make
a single payment of $5,000 and could such a promise be enforced by the sole
plaintiff David Miller.
<P>

17	As I have already indicated, it was the plaintiff's primary case that the
agreement was between himself and the defendant, Wendy
Miller not being a
party.  It was the defendant's case that the agreement was between himself and
Wendy Miller, David Miller not
being a party. It was in the interests of the
plaintiff (and Wendy Miller) to adopt the position that David Miller, and not
Wendy
Miller, had been the party to the agreement.  In the first place, it was
a possible construction of the deed of release of 16 August
1991 that it barred
claims by Wendy Miller but did not bar claims by David Miller. Secondly, Wendy
Miller became bankrupt in 1993
and it was conceded by counsel for the plaintiff
that any claim she had against the defendant would, with the rest of her
property,
have become vested in her trustee in bankruptcy and would have
remained vested in her trustee in bankruptcy, notwithstanding her
later
discharge from bankruptcy.  It troubled me throughout the hearing that no
notice of the proceedings had been given to the Bankruptcy
Administration and
eventually a letter giving notice of the proceedings was sent to the Official
Receiver.
<P>

18	The evidence in the proceedings consisted of affidavit evidence, oral
evidence and various exhibits.  The witnesses for the plaintiff
were the
plaintiff himself, Wendy Miller and Mr Jugmans, a valuer who gave evidence of
the value of shares in Ladycare Services.
 The witnesses for the defendant were
the defendant himself, his wife Mrs Shea, two witnesses Mr Hindmarsh and Mr
McGonigal who gave
evidence concerning the entering into of the deed of release
of 16 August 1991, some other minor witnesses and Mr James a valuer
who
received and commented on a report by Mr Jugmans and himself gave evidence of
the value of shares in Ladycare Services.  Without
attempting to make an
exhaustive summary of the evidence, all of which I have taken into account, I
will refer to certain aspects
of the evidence of the three principal
witnesses.
<P>

	<b>Plaintiff's affidavit</b>
<P>

19	In his affidavit the plaintiff said that up to about September 1990 he had
been employed by Rentokil, which inter alia carried
on the business of
providing sanitary services in women's toilets.  The plaintiff's wife suggested
that he start his own business
of providing sanitary services and that her
brother the defendant could be interested in such a venture.  A meeting took
place at
the defendant's home, at which the plaintiff, Wendy Miller, the
defendant and the defendant's wife were present.  At the meeting
the plaintiff
said to the defendant:-
<P>

	"We do not have the finances to establish the business and Wendy and I would
need to have a minimum salary of $5,000 per month
initially.  I know how to run
the business, I know what is needed but we need the input of finance to make it
work.  If you could
put in the capital to get the business  going and give us
between us a minimum of $5,000.00 per month, we could probably strike a
deal".
<P>

	The defendant said that he was interested.
<P>

20	In July 1990 a further meeting took place at the defendant's home.  At this
meeting the plaintiff presented a budget for the
new business.  There was
discussion about various methods of manufacturing bins, of cleaning the dirty
bins and of disposing of the
waste.  The defendant said inter alia:-
<P>

	"I will agree to put in $5,000.00 per month and pay this to Wendy or yourself
if you want some as well as a consultancy fee for
the first twelve months.
After the first twelve months such fee will be paid by the company which I
expect will then be self supporting.
 I suggest however that the fee be paid to
Wendy as your contract of employment with Rentokil prohibits you from
approaching clients
of Rentokil for six months following termination of your
employment with Rentokil.  I will assist with the establishment of the
business".
<P>

21	The defendant showed the plaintiff a document.  The defendant said he had
used the document when forming a partnership with a
previous business partner.
The defendant said "take the document home, alter or add anything to it
relative to the new business and
this will constitute our partnership".  A copy
of the document which it was alleged the defendant had shown the plaintiff was
annexed
to the plaintiff's affidavit.  The document is in the form of an
agreement.  The typewritten name of one party to the agreement has
been crossed
out and the name "Wendy Miller Enterprises" (a business name solely owned by
Wendy Miller) has been substituted in handwriting.
<P>

22	In July 1990 after a meeting with the defendant's solicitor the plaintiff
and the defendant went to a Sydney hotel.  At the hotel
the defendant said to
the plaintiff:-
<P>

	"I should receive 60% shareholding in Ladycare Services as I am taking the
financial risk.  You should not become a shareholder
in Ladycare Services until
the six month period provided for in the employment contract of Rentokil has
expired.  I would like you
to approach employees of Rentokil, ones that would
be good, and persuade them to commence employment with Ladycare Services".
<P>

23	According to the plaintiff's evidence, he had been advised by Mr McCormack,
the defendant's solicitor, that he (the plaintiff)
could not approach clients
of Rentokil for six months after he ceased to be employed by Rentokil.  The
plaintiff approached certain
employees of Rentokil, who agreed to leave the
employment of Rentokil and work for the new company.
<P>

24	On 8 October 1990 the new company Ladycare Services commenced carrying on
business.  The defendant said to the plaintiff:-
<P>

	"I'm somewhat concerned about your employment contract with Rentokil and I
suggest that for the first six months you do not call
any clients of any
description including non-Rentokil clients and you should adopt an office
role".
<P>

25	On 2 November 1990 the defendant paid $5,000 to Wendy Miller.  In late
November 1990 the defendant said that he would not be
paying any more money "at
the moment".
<P>

26	On 12 December 1990 Rentokil brought legal proceedings against the
plaintiff, two of the other former employees of Rentokil who
had left Rentokil
and were working for Ladycare Services, and Ladycare Services itself.  Rentokil
obtained various interim orders,
including an order restraining certain of the
defendants from competing with Rentokil for six months after the termination of
their
contracts of employment with Rentokil.  
<P>

27	About the end of December 1990 Wendy Miller, who had been working only
part-time for Ladycare Services, started working on a
full-time basis as sales
director.
<P>

28	Annexed to the plaintiff's affidavit is a copy of a letter bearing the date
11 September 1990.  This letter purports to be a
letter from the plaintiff to
the defendant in the following terms:-
<P>

	"Mr Jim Shea
<P>

	19/16, Wilga Street
<P>

	Bondi  2026
<P>

	11 September 1990
<P>

	Dear Jim,
<P>

	Just a short note to confirm what has transpired in respect to the new
business.  I have tendered my resignation to Rentokil (which
they were not too
pleased about) and I am free to commence our new venture on 5/10/90.
<P>

	I think they will try and negotiate with me to stay with them, however this
opportunity to start our new business is too good to
miss.
<P>

	I should also keep you up too date with the outcome of the discussions I have
had with the Rentokil staff you asked me to approach.
 Both Mary-Anne and Kim
Blogg have agreed to join our sales team, and Lou Wilbow has agreed to run the
service side of the business.
 My secretary Jan Wise has also agreed to join
us.  As we agreed, I will organise a lunch so you can meet with them, and
confirm
the remuneration packages we agreed to offer them  
<P>

	They are only required to give Rentokil two weeks notice however Kim and
Mary-Anne have requested we source their company cars
in time for them to move
straight into their new jobs, as obviously they will have to return their
current vehicles to Rentokil.
<P>

	As far as Wendy and I are concerned, would you please confirm what day of the
month you will be paying us the $5000 per month you
agreed upon.  The fifteenth
of the month would be preferable as we would not then have to change the date
of our mortgage repayment.
<P>

	Would you also confirm that the car you have kindly offered me to use as
replacement for my company car will be available on the
fifth.  I've never
driven a Mercedes before, so I'm quite looking forward to that.
<P>

	Jim, both Wendy and I are very excited about our pending partnership in
business, and I know that with my expertise and that of
the people I am
bringing with me, together with your financial support, we can look forward to
a very successful future.
<P>

	I will be returning from this conference I am on in four days, so I will catch
up with you then and discuss things at greater length
then.
<P>

	Best Regards,
<P>

	David".
<P>

29	I note at this stage that the defendant denied having received such a letter
and that the authenticity of the letter as a contemporaneous
document written
on 11 September 1990 was strongly challenged by the defendant.
<P>

30	At about the end of March 1991, after the six months period had expired
(regardless of which of the events it was calculated
from), the plaintiff asked
the defendant to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services to
him.  The defendant said that
there was continuing trouble with Rentokil, that
he did not want shares in Ladycare Services to be transferred to the plaintiff
and
that he wanted the shares in Ladycare Services to be transferred to the
plaintiff's wife, who had had no connection with Rentokil.
 The plaintiff
agreed to 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services being transferred to
his wife.  No shares in Ladycare Services
were in fact transferred either to
the plaintiff or his wife.
<P>

31	In July 1991 the plaintiff and his wife were in deep financial trouble.  The
bank to which their home was mortgaged was pressing
them to sell the home,
because the bank was no longer prepared to defer receiving mortgage payments.
The plaintiff and his wife instructed
a firm of solicitors, Eddy McCausland
&amp; Walker, and those solicitors wrote a letter (which is not in evidence)
requesting the
transfer of 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services to
Wendy Miller.
<P>

32	On 19 July 1991 the defendant's solicitor McCormacks wrote a letter to Eddy
McCausland &amp; Walker, which was headed "without
prejudice" but which was not
objected to at the hearing.  Part of this letter was in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"We note your clients threat to institute proceedings in the Equity Division
in relation to the issuing to Mrs Miller of a 40%
interest in the company
(Ladycare Services) and the appointing of Mrs Miller as a Director of the
company.  We are instructed in
relation to these two (2) matters as
follows:-
<P>

	1. The Directors of Lady Care Services Pty Limited acknowledge that Mrs Miller
has an entitlement to 40% of the company. In view
of the current state of
things between Mr and Mrs Miller and Mr Shea the Directors of Lady Care
Services Pty Limited do not wish
to issue any shares. The arrangement made was
that shares would be issued to a Mr and Mrs Sykes who would grant an option
over those
shares in favour of Mrs Miller which can be exercised on the
happening of certain events. In view of the current situation and the
proposal
to sell the company the Directors of Lady Care Services Pty Limited do not
consider it appropriate nor advisable that the
shares now be issued. We are
instructed to repeat that our client admits the entitlement of Mrs Miller to
40% of the company.
<P>

	2. Regarding the appointing of Mrs Miller as a Director this was discussed in
more amicable times. The Directors of Lady Care Services
Pty Limited are not
disposed to appoint Mrs Miller a Director in the present circumstances.
<P>

	Our client has instructed us that he wishes this matter to be disposed of
swiftly and amicably.
<P>

	Would you please write to us and advise your instructions and what are your
clients proposals in respect of the business conducted
by Lady Care Services
Pty Limited.  We understand your client has a proposal for the sale of the
business or is obtaining a proposal
for the sale of the business".
<P>

33	Draft minutes were prepared for a meeting of Ladycare Services to be held on
18 July 1991.  The draft minutes were not signed
but no objection was taken to
the adducing of the draft minutes in evidence.  Parts of the draft minutes were
in the following terms:-
<P>

	"BUSINESS: Mr Shea reported to the meeting that certain problems had arisen in
relation to Mr and Mrs Miller. Mr Shea informed
the meeting that Mrs Miller was
no longer working for the company.  Mr Shea further advised the meeting that
Mrs Miller had asked
the Company to issue to her a 40% interest therein and to
appoint her as an additional Director.
<P>

	RESOLVED: The Company acknowledged Mrs Miller's entitlement to a 40% interest
in the Company but in view of the conflict having
arisen it was advised not to
issue the shares at this stage. The Company would however acknowledge that Mrs
Miller has a 40% entitlement
in the Company.  In relation to the appointment of
Mrs Miller as an additional Director the Company resolved that in view of
present
circumstances not to appoint Mrs Miller as an additional Director".
<P>

34	By August 1991 the financial position of the plaintiff and his wife had
worsened.  The bank had commenced proceedings for possession
of their home.
Their car had been repossessed.  American Express threatened to take bankruptcy
proceedings against Wendy Miller.
 In these circumstances Wendy Miller
telephoned her brother the defendant.  In the telephone conversation she said
that she needed
$25,000 to pay major debts.  The defendant said that he would
give Wendy Miller a cheque and that they should meet the following
day at a
coffee shop at Chippendale.  
<P>

35	On 16 August a meeting took place at the coffee shop between the plaintiff,
his wife and the defendant.  The plaintiff gave the
following account of the
meeting in his affidavit:-
<P>

	"On 16 August 1991 Wendy and I met Shea and he produced a cheque made out to
Wendy for $25,000.  He also produced a document which
he said would release him
from any further action that may be taken against him.  Shea said words to the
effect,
<P>

	`Unless you both sign the document you will not get the cheque and you will
not get another opportunity.  You must do it now or
not at all'.
<P>

	I refused to sign the document because we were not given the opportunity to
get legal advice.  Wendy became extremely upset that
I would not sign the
document. She said words to the effect,
<P>

	`I am fearful of losing our home and our children will be under threat of
being removed from school as we cannot pay the school
fees.'
<P>

	Wendy became severely distressed and under protest I signed the document.
Shea then gave us the cheque and we left".
<P>

	<b>Wendy Miller's affidavit</b>
<P>

36	Wendy Miller's affidavit confirmed some parts of the plaintiff's affidavit.
She gave an account of conversations between the
plaintiff and the defendant in
her presence, which would indicate that the plaintiff was experienced in the
business of providing
sanitary services, whereas the defendant in 1990 knew
nothing about such a business.  Mrs Miller gave the following evidence about
the payment of $5,000 on 2 November 1990:-
<P>

	"On 2 November 1990, I approached Shea and said to him `Jimmy, we need the
$5,000 monthly payment for October as we need to pay
our mortgage and do a
shop'.  Later that day, Shea came up to me and said `Wendy here is your monthly
$5,000 payment, I have made
it out to Wendy Miller Enterprises, as I want to
claim it as a consultancy fee'".
<P>

37	In late June 1991 Wendy Miller had a conversation with her husband, in which
he said inter alia that he needed to do something
to make the defendant listen
to him and that he had decided to remove customer files from the business's
office at Chippendale. 
The plaintiff proceeded to remove customer files from
the office but the files were returned soon afterwards.  Further evidence was
given about this episode by other witnesses.  The plaintiff and Wendy Miller
also collected some cheques in favour of Ladycare Services
from customers of
the business and banked these cheques into the business's bank account.  David
Miller as a signatory on the bank
account then drew a cheque on the bank
account for $4,000 in favour of himself.
<P>

38	In July 1991 there were communications between Wendy Miller and the
defendant, which were only lightly touched on in her affidavit
but which were
dealt with more fully in other evidence. According to Wendy Miller's affidavit,
she made arrangements to meet the
defendant at the business's office but when
she went to the office the defendant told her that he did not want to see her
on the
premises again.
<P>

39	On 15 August Wendy Miller telephoned the defendant.  In her affidavit she
said that the conversation was as follows:-
<P>

	"'Jimmy, both David and I have given up good careers to establish this
business with you, and now because of your actions, we have
no money, the bank
is going to sell our house and the boys may have to leave their school because
we can't pay their fees'.  I said
`Jimmy I don't believe you could do something
like this particularly to your own sister'.  Then I said to him `under the
circumstances
I think you should cough up with some money to help us pay some
of our debts.'  Shea replied by saying `How much will you need to
cover your
immediate debts?' and I said `about $25,000.' Shea then said `O.K Wendy, you
and David meet me at the coffee shop in Meagher
Street at about eleven o'clock
tomorrow and I'll have a cheque for you'".
<P>

40	The meeting took place the following day. Para 16 of Wendy Miller's
affidavit was in the following terms:-
<P>

	"We met Shea as arranged and we sat and ordered a coffee.  Shea produced a
cheque for $25,000 made out to Wendy Miller together
with a document.  Shea
then said to my husband and myself `I have had this Deed of Release made up to
say that you both agree to
have nothing to do with the business in the future
or make any future claims against me and if you agree to sign this I will give
you this cheque'.  My husband replied by saying `You have to be kidding, that
is not the arrangement you made with Wendy on the phone
and besides I am not
going to sign a document like that without getting legal advice first'.  Shea
then said to us `This is the last
offer I am making if you don't sign this
release now, you won't get the cheque'.  I became very distressed with the
whole situation
and said to my husband `We desperately need this money to keep
the kids in school and to pay our mortgage.  We don't have money to
seek legal
advice against Jimmy and I just want to sign this and forget we ever became
involved with him'. My husband said `All right
I will sign it under protest.'
After we both signed the release my husband said `Jimmy, I need a copy of this
release'.  He replied
by saying `I will get it witnessed and have my solicitor
Michael McCormack send you a copy'.  We then got up to leave and Shea said
`Would you like to have a drink at The Gladstone before you go and my husband
replied, `We don't drink with con men and thieves'
and then we both left and
went home".
<P>

	<b>Defendant's affidavits</b>
<P>

41	The defendant James Shea made three affidavits, a principal affidavit, an
affidavit in which he replied to Wendy Miller's affidavit
and an affidavit in
which he described the business of Ladycare Services, as it has been carried on
since 1991.  I have taken all
of this material into account but I will only
refer to some of the more important parts.
<P>

42	In his principal affidavit the defendant agreed that in 1990 he had had a
conversation with his sister in which his sister had
suggested that he might be
interested in a business providing sanitary services.
<P>

43	A meeting was subsequently held at the defendant's home, which was attended
by the plaintiff, Wendy Miller, the defendant, the
defendant's wife and the
defendant's son James Shea.  At this meeting the proposed business was
discussed.
<P>

44	At a further meeting between the plaintiff and the defendant the plaintiff
allegedly said that the company would be profitable
within two months.
According to the defendant, further conversation was in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"'Wendy, since she is my sister and has three children, I agree will receive
40% of this venture.  This 40% will be signed over
to Wendy when the company
reaches profit and has paid back the money invested by me through the Shea
Family Companies.  When that
debt is paid in full, then I will issue the shares
to Wendy.  The shares would be issued to Wendy after all moneys that have been
paid to get it started have been re-paid to the Shea Family companies and the
company is in a profit situation'.
<P>

	The Plaintiff then said words to the effect:
<P>

	`That is agreeable to me. My involvement in this venture is to provide
expertise in this type of business'.
<P>

	The Plaintiff then said:
<P>

	`After the first month the company will generate enough money to cover all our
needs.  This is because the contracts in this industry
are paid twelve months
in advance, which is common in this type of business. So for a small capital
investment, the company will
be profitable and self funding within two
months'.
<P>

	The Plaintiff thereafter said:
<P>

	`So when the capital is paid back to you, Wendy will get 40% shares.'
<P>

	I said:
<P>

	`Your remuneration will be from Wendy's share.  Whatever agreement you have
between yourselves is for you'.
<P>

	The Plaintiff said:
<P>

	`Yes. It will only take two months for the company to be in profit for a
capital input of around $50,000.00 and from then on it
will be self funding and
be able to finance its own growth'.
<P>

	I said:
<P>

	`When the company can afford it, I will get back the capital, and when the
capital is fully re-paid, Wendy will get her 40%.'"
<P>

45	The roles to be performed by the plaintiff and the defendant were agreed.
The defendant was to provide capital and to exploit
business contacts he had
which might be useful for the new business.  The plaintiff was to provide
management skills and expertise.
 However, after the company commenced carrying
on business the defendant found that he was working seven days a week in the
company's
business.  The defendant complained in his affidavit that the
plaintiff worked only short hours, that sanitary bins cost more than
the
plaintiff had predicted, that waste disposal was a greater problem than the
plaintiff had represented and that some of the staff
who the plaintiff had
recruited from Rentokil turned out to be unsuitable.
<P>

46	The defendant said that the payment of $5,000 made to Wendy Miller
Enterprises in November 1990 was made as a result of a specific
request by
Wendy Miller (and not pursuant to any standing agreement).
<P>

47	On 11 December 1990 Ladycare Services was served with court proceedings by
Rentokil.  Until these proceedings were served, the
defendant had not been
aware of any restraint on the legal capacity of the plaintiff to work in
Ladycare Services' business. The
court proceedings brought by Rentokil were not
ultimately disposed of until November 1991, when they were settled.  In April
1991
the managing director of Rentokil wrote a letter to the defendant, stating
an intention then held by Rentokil to proceed with an
action for damages
against the plaintiff and calling for a return of Rentokil customer lists and
printed material.
<P>

48	In his affidavit the defendant gave evidence about the taking by the
plaintiff of the company records and of the cheques.  On
the afternoon of 25
June 1991 the defendant was out of his office. The following day he was
informed by an employee that all the
company's records had disappeared.  The
defendant ascertained that the company's records were indeed missing and that
cheques in
favour of the company which had come in the previous day's mail were
also missing.  The defendant telephoned the plaintiff and demanded
that the
records and the cheques be returned.  On the afternoon of 27 June, at a time
when the defendant was not present, the records
were returned.  The cheques
were not returned.  The defendant ascertained from banking records that on 27
June three cheques in favour
of the company totalling $7,372 had been paid into
the company's bank account by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had drawn a
cheque for $4,000 on the company's bank account payable to himself.  Later the
same day the plaintiff telephoned the defendant. 
The plaintiff said, "I'm
through with your company".  The defendant said, "Good.  I don't want to see
you around here ever again".
 However, the following day it was agreed that
Wendy Miller would continue to work at the company with responsibility for
sales.
 
<P>

49	On 29 July 1991 the defendant received two letter from Wendy Miller.  It is
necessary to set out both letters in full.  The first
letter was in the
following terms:-
<P>

	"Dear Jimmy,
<P>

	Following our telephone conversation this morning please find herewith the
points I believe we should agree on if we are to continue
the business of Lady
Care Services.
<P>

	However because of the circumstances I think the best solution would be to
sell the business at a price that will ensure you receive
back your initial
investment into the business.  At this stage we have received two offers for
the business that may come within
the figure required to do that.  You will
also be aware that I can only negotiate 40% of the business with interested
parties.  However
we are prepared if necessary to make up your loan account
from this 40% to ensure my family does not have to carry on with the heartache,
poor health and financial difficulties that we have endured and which we did
not suffer from prior to being enticed into the business.
 I personally do not
wish to carry on in this vain. (sic)
<P>

	David and I are both now gainfully employed therefore please do not worry
about that aspect.
<P>

	To refresh your memory and I quote your statement `I will finance the business
for 12 months only to get it up and running'. `I
am only doing this for you
Wendy' is the reason we agreed to your having 60% of the business.
<P>

	Jimmy please let's do something for each other now by ending this current
fiasco, or if we have to continue to run it in a true
and ethical business
fashion, as it should have been done right from the start.
<P>

	I believe the following points will assist us in doing that and I hope they
meet with your approval.
<P>

	On receipt of this letter you can telephone me at home today to arrange a time
to settle this matter or alternatively you can arrange
for your solicitor to
contact our solicitor.
<P>

	Regards
<P>

	Wendy.
<P>

	P.S. I have taken the liberty of sending a copy of this to each of our
solicitors as we cannot ask them to act on our behalf unless
they are aware of
our intentions."
<P>

The other letter was in the following terms:-
<P>

	"Att:  Jim Shea				Without Prejudice
<P>

	From:  Wendy Miller
<P>

	Re:  Lady Care Services
<P>

	Date:  29 July 1991
<P>

	Following our telephone conversation this morning please find below
recommendations to be agreed on should we continue with the
business of Lady
Care Services:-
<P>

	1.	Shares to be assigned as agreed, to Wendy Miller, equal to 40% of the
business.
<P>

	2.	Management fee of $5,000.00 per month to be paid to Wendy Miller, as agreed
on by both parties prior to commencement of the
business.
<P>

	3.	Interest on loan account to be charged at 14% and not at 17% as interest
was not discussed at any time prior or during commencement
of business, this is
why we agreed for you to have 60% of the business as upon with taking the
risk.
<P>

	4.	$1,000.00 per month lease on Mercedes owned by Jim Shea to cease, as this
was not discussed or agreed on prior to commencement
of business.  This vehicle
is not required as other company vehicles are available.
<P>

	5.	Rent of premises was not discussed or agreed on prior to commencement of
business, we offer $1,000.00 per month for rent should
this not be acceptable
LCS should move to premises that are cheaper.
<P>

	6.	All fuel accounts including Jim Shea's to come from business LCS and not
from the loan account as has been the case.
<P>

	7.	All company cheques to have signatures of Jim Shea and Wendy Miller (both
are required).
<P>

	8.	We need where necessary 30 days line of credit to be arranged with
suppliers.
<P>

	9.	All correspondence to be seen by both parties and signed and such.
<P>

	10.	The two cars being paid by Walto Pty Limited to be sold as they are not
required.  Should they retained they are to be paid
by LCS and not through the
loan account.
<P>

	11.	A copy of all claims of the loan account to be forwarded in detail to
either Wendy Miller or her solicitor Mr Nicholas Eddy,
and amount of the loan
account to be agreed.
<P>

	12.	If both parties (Jim Shea and Wendy Miller) agree to the above points in
the agreement, I would recommend we commence this
agreement back to 1 July
1991."
<P>

50	On 15 August 1991 the defendant received a telephone call from Wendy Miller.
His account of this conversation was as follows:-
<P>

Wendy Miller said:-
<P>

	"I don't want to have any further upsets in the Family.  I do want to be
friends with you.  To do this we should separate and not
have anything further
to do with the company.  Will you give me $25,000.00 and David and I will cease
to have anything to do with
the company'.
<P>

	I said:
<P>

	`Yes'.
<P>

	We made an appointment to meet with David at a Coffee shop in Meagher Street,
Chippendale at approximately 3.00 pm.
<P>

51	Following the telephone call from his sister the defendant instructed his
solicitors to prepare a deed of release.  He also contacted
Colin McGonigal and
asked him to come to the coffee shop as an independent witness.  At the meeting
at the coffee shop the deed of
release prepared by the defendant's solicitor
was signed.  Mr McGonigal as a witness initialled each page.  The deed of
release was
in the following terms:-
<P>

	"THIS DEED OF RELEASE is made the 16th day of August 1991
<P>

	BETWEEN:  LADY CARE SERVICES PTY LIMITED A.C.N   of 137 Regent Street
Chippendale in the State of New South Wales (`the Company')
of the one part
<P>

	AND:  JAMES FREDERICK SHEA of 137 Regent Street Chippendale in the said State
(`Shea') of the second part
<P>

	AND:  DAVID MILLER of 6B Bate Avenue Allambie in the said State of the third
part
<P>

	AND:  WENDY MILLER of 6B Bate Avenue Allambie in the said State of the fourth
part
<P>

	WHEREAS
<P>

A.	The Company is in the business of providing and servicing Sanitary Napkin
Bins and Air Fresheners (`the Business').
<P>

	B.	Shea is a Director of the company and the Managing Director of the Company
and in that capacity is in charge of the day to day
running of the Business.
<P>

	C.	Wendy Miller consulted to the Company and has from time to time asserted a
claim for ownership of shares in the Company.
<P>

	D.	David Miller is possessed of certain knowledge of the Business and has from
time to time discussed with Shea and the Company
the method of conducting the
Business and is aware of some facets of the running of the Business.
<P>

	E.	The parties to this Deed have agreed to settle all disputes between them on
the basis of the payment and releases and covenants
hereinafter contained.
<P>

	WITNESSES that in consideration of the sum of twenty five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) paid by the Company to David Miller and
Wendy Miller jointly and
in consideration of the covenants and release in this Deed -
<P>

	1.	David Miller and Wendy Miller hereby forever release the Company and Shea
from all claims actions rights conditions and the
like which David Miller
and/or Wendy Miller may have against the Company and/or Shea.
<P>

	2.	For a period of two (2) years from the date of this Deed and within the
State of New South Wales David Miller will not either
directly or indirectly
alone or in partnership or in the employment of any person firm or corporation
compete for the custom or business
of any person firm or corporation who is at
the date hereof a customer or client of the Company or Shea in connection with
the Business.
<P>

	3.	For a period of (2) years from the date of this Deed and within the State
of New South Wales David Miller will not either directly
or indirectly alone or
in partnership or in the employment of any person firm or corporation compete
for the custom or business of
any person firm or corporation in connection with
the Business conducted by the Company."
<P>

52	In his affidavit the defendant said he "observed that all the parties
appeared...to be at ease".  After the signing of the document
the defendant,
the plaintiff and Wendy Miller went to the Gladstone Hotel at Chippendale and
had a couple of drinks.
<P>

53	The defendant asserted that in August 1991 Ladycare Services was operating
at a loss.  The defendant saw himself as having two
options, either to sell the
business or to attempt to turn the business around.  The defendant decided to
"rebuild" Ladycare Services.
 The defendant changed the method of manufacturing
sanitary bins used by the company.  He applied himself to familiarising himself
with new techniques and technology in the industry.  He introduced a
computerised operation system. He expanded the range of products
Ladycare
Services provided.  He made a number of innovations in the business, including
introducing an air freshener with a light
sensor and a special type of washing
machine for improving the washing of sanitary bins.  Most of the current
clients of the business
had been introduced to the business by himself or by
the current sales staff.  The company now has a staff of nineteen or
thereabouts.
<P>

54	In various parts of his affidavit the defendant denied that he had had
conversations with the plaintiff in the terms alleged
by the plaintiff in his
affidavit.  He also denied that he had ever agreed to pay $5,000 per month for
the first twelve months the
company was operating or for any period, that he
had told the plaintiff that the plaintiff could make alterations to a document
handed
to the plaintiff and that the altered document would constitute the
partnership agreement between them.  The defendant said that
he had never seen
the alleged letter of 11 September 1990 (before a copy of it appeared as an
annexure to the plaintiff's affidavit).
The defendant said that in response to
specific requests from Wendy Miller he had between 2 November 1990 and 16
August 1991 made
payments to Wendy Miller totalling $53,769.14.  These payments
were as follows:-

57	The defendant denied that he had been aware of the financial circumstances
of the plaintiff.  He said that the minutes of a meeting
of Ladycare Services
to be held on 18 July 1991 were only a draft prepared by a solicitor and had
never been adopted by the company.
<P>

58	In his second affidavit the defendant denied that most of the conversations
alleged by Wendy Miller in her affidavit (which had
been filed after his first
affidavit) had occurred in the terms alleged by Wendy Miller.  The defendant
said that at the meeting
on 16 August 1991 when the deed of release was signed,
David Miller had handed him a document, saying "you might as well take this,
as
it is of no use to me".  This document was a letter dated 17 July 1991
purporting to be "an opinion as to the fair value of the
business conducted by
(Ladycare Services) for use by yourself (David Miller) as a guide to what a
willing buyer would pay a willing
seller for the company's business on a going
concern basis".  In the letter the writer, Wayne A Aitken, accountant,
expressed an
opinion that "the value of the business on a capitalised future
net revenues basis would be $170,797."  It will be necessary to refer
to this
"valuation" later in this judgment.
<P>

59	In a further affidavit the defendant gave further evidence about the
operations of Ladycare Services.  He said that he is the
managing director and
devotes all of his time to the company's operations.  Other members of his
family also work in the business.
 The industry in which the company
participates has become more competitive since 1991 and the standard form of
contract with a customer
has changed from a form of contract where fees were
payable twelve months in advance to a form of contract where fees are payable
one month in arrears.  In the year ended 30 June 1991 a Shea family company
provided Ladycare Services with funds totalling $106,607.
 In the next
financial year the same company provided further funds of $30,000.  Ladycare
Services has a number of employees in administration,
sales, management and
operations.
<P>

60	The defendant also relied on affidavits by his wife Jan Shea, his son James
Shea, Mr Hindmarsh, Mr McGonigal, Mr McCormack his
solicitor, Jeffrey Miller
(Wendy Miller's first husband) and Jan Wise (an employee of Rentokil who joined
Ladycare Services). I have
taken all of these affidavits into consideration.
Mrs Shea claimed in her affidavit that she was present at meetings with either
or both of the plaintiff and Wendy Miller at which her husband had said "when
the business has paid back my initial contributions
and is making a profit, I
will give Wendy a 40 per cent share in the business".  Colin Hindmarsh gave
evidence that he was the owner
of the Gladstone Hotel, Chippendale, that he
knew the plaintiff, Wendy Miller and the defendant, that he could recall a late
afternoon
in or about mid 1991 when the three of them came to the hotel and had
a couple of drinks.  On this occasion there was conversation
about the sale by
the plaintiff and Wendy Miller of their interest in Ladycare Services.  Mr
Hindmarsh said "I observed that the
parties were quite amicable and indeed
jovial in their discussion".
<P>

61	Colin McGonigal said that he had had a business at Chippendale, and that on
16 August 1991 he had been asked by the defendant
to witness the signing of a
document.  He met the defendant and the two of them went to a coffee shop.  At
the shop he was introduced
to the plaintiff and Wendy Miller. A document was
produced.  The document was signed by the other persons present and Mr
McGonigal
witnessed their signatures.  Mr McGonigal said "no person gave the
appearance of signing under duress".
<P>

	<b>Plaintiff's Oral Evidence</b>
<P>

62	In his oral evidence in chief the plaintiff said that he had not received
any income between October 1990 and June 1991, apart
from such payments as had
been made by the defendant to Wendy Miller. He said that when he had taken the
company's records in June
1991, he had written down "the values" from the
service contracts and had supplied this information to the accountant Mr
Aitken.
 
<P>

63	In cross-examination the plaintiff did not accept that most of the important
conversations in which the venture had been discussed
were conversations to
which Wendy Miller was a party and did not accept that the defendant had said
that he was prepared to enter
into the venture only in order to help his
sister.  
<P>

64	The plaintiff was cross-examined about when in his view a breach of the
alleged agreement had occurred.  He said that 40 per
cent of the shares in
Ladycare Services should have been transferred to him by April 1991, so that by
April 1991 a breach of the
agreement had occurred.  The plaintiff insisted that
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services were "mine". He added "where
I
want to put them is my decision.  He (the defendant) wouldn't sign them over to
me, so I said `well sign them to Wendy'".
<P>

65	As regards the signing of the deed of release on 16 August 1991 the
plaintiff said:-
<P>

	"I didn't understand the document at the time because no document was even
discussed prior to us coming to the meeting and it was
just brought out and
shoved under our noses and we were told `if you don't sign this, you won't get
the $25,000' and therefore I
didn't have a chance to have legal advice and my
wife was in a very stressed situation and that's the reason it got signed but
at
no time prior to that did we even know that document had been prepared".
<P>

66	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the delay of four years in commencing
the present proceedings.  He explained "it took
that long to get back on our
feet because my wife had been made a bankrupt and the family had been in
disarray and we were getting
back on our feet.  We didn't have any money to
take him to court".
<P>

67	As regards the role the plaintiff was to perform in Ladycare Services, the
plaintiff agreed that his only contribution was to
inject his expertise and
that he had had no obligation to inject any capital and that he had ceased to
inject any expertise into
the business in late June 1991.
<P>

68	The plaintiff confirmed that his claim was to receive 40 per cent of the
current value of Ladycare Services, notwithstanding
the long delay in
instituting proceedings and the further delay of approximately three years to
the commencement of the hearing.
<P>

69	The animosity the plaintiff feels for the defendant was apparent at a number
of stages in his evidence.  He said that the defendant
"tried to threaten me
away from Wendy" and that the defendant had never approved of his relationship
with the defendant's sister.
<P>

70	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the document which he had said had
been handed to him by the defendant and which he said
the defendant had invited
him to alter, so that it would become the agreement between them for the
purpose of the venture.  He agreed
that the first alteration he had made to the
document was to substitute as a party "Wendy Miller Enterprises", which was a
business
name of which Wendy Miller was the sole proprietor.  
<P>

71	In regard to the alleged promise by the defendant to pay $5,000.00 a month
for the first twelve months, the plaintiff alleged
that the agreement was to
pay his wife and himself.  He was referred to para 2(vii) of the statement of
claim, in which it is alleged
that the promise by the defendant was a promise
to make the payments to the plaintiff's wife. 
<P>

72	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the letter bearing the date 11
September 1990.  He said that the letter had been typed
by him on a word
processor during a lunch break at a conference of national branch managers of
Rentokil being held at a hotel at
Manly.  He said that he had attended this
conference, notwithstanding that on his evidence he had already tendered his
resignation
from the employment of Rentokil.
<P>

73	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the letter of 19 July 1991 written by
McCormacks to Eddy McCausland &amp; Walker, in which
McCormacks referred to a
claim by Wendy Miller to be entitled to a 40 per cent interest in Ladycare
Services.  The plaintiff said
that it was he who had the entitlement to receive
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services and "I was passing my shares on
to Wendy".  The plaintiff did not have a copy of Eddy McCausland &amp; Walker's
letter to which McCormack's letter was a reply. 
He asserted that "the letter
stated that the shares were totally my entitlement but they be transferred to
Wendy... to be held in
trust".
<P>

74	The plaintiff said that he took the company's files in June 1991, partly as
a way of putting commercial pressure on the defendant
and partly as a means of
obtaining information about the sales the company had made.  He denied that the
taking of the files had
caused a final breakdown of the relationship between
the defendant and himself.  In re-examination he said that he had taken the
files because the defendant refused to discuss the matter of the shares any
longer.  Taking the files was the only way he could see
of making the defendant
sit down and talk with him.
<P>

75	As regards the taking of the company's cheques, he said "we had a verbal
agreement with Jimmy Shea and he told us that if we
wanted money to go out and
get it, which we did, we called on the customers and collected cheques".  It
was pointed out that no such
assertion had been made in the plaintiff's
affidavit and that it would have been important for the plaintiff to say, if it
was true,
that the company had through its director Mr Shea consented to the
plaintiff taking the company's money.  
<P>

76	Although he had denied that his taking of the company's files had caused the
final breakdown of his relationship with the defendant,
the plaintiff accepted
that any dealings with the defendant in July 1991 were "through the vehicle of
your wife". The plaintiff wanted
to bring legal proceedings against the
defendant but had no money for such proceedings.  Wendy Miller had shown him
the two letters
of 29 July 1991, before they were sent to the defendant.  The
plaintiff said that he had "breezed through" the letters but later
admitted
that he had read them.  He told his wife that he thought she was wasting her
time in writing the letters.  He said to his
wife "do what you like, because I
am fed up with this guy".  He agreed that he had not said to his wife words to
the effect "listen
Wendy this is my 40 per cent equity in this company.  I
don't want you offering any deals in relation to it".  He did not tell his
wife
that the shares she was referring to in her letters were not her shares but
his.  The plaintiff was cross-examined about the
assertion in one of the
letters that "David and I are both gainfully employed, therefore please do not
worry about that aspect" and
said that "we actually had jobs again". 
<P>

77	The plaintiff was asked a number of questions about the meeting on 16 August
1991 and the signing of the deed of release.  He
denied that Mr McGonigal had
been present.  He denied that as at 16 August he still had solicitors acting
for him.  He had "finished"
with Eddy McCausland &amp; Walker, after having
been advised by that firm that they could not take court proceedings which the
plaintiff
and his wife were financially unable to support.  He denied that he
was "happy to get $25,000 and disengage himself from Mr Shea".
 He asserted
that the witness to the deed was "the guy serving in the coffee shop".  He was
asked whether he had been under any pressure
to sign the document and he said
"I wasn't personally except for my wife Wendy" and "she was really quite sick".
He denied that he
had gone to a hotel after the document was signed.  
<P>

	<b>Wendy Miller's Oral Evidence</b>
<P>

78	Wendy Miller gave brief oral evidence in chief.  She was asked what had
happened after the deed of release was signed and she
replied:-
<P>

	"We walked up the street, which was where our car was parked, on the other
side, and we went home.  Jimmy did ask us to go in for
a drink but we didn't.
It wasn't the most pleasant of circumstances and David was very aggravated and
I was extremely upset, so I
was in no condition to socialise, quite frankly, so
we got in the car and we drove and we went to the National Bank at Mosman and
then we went home...we were desperate for money at that stage...we were
supposed to put it in the Westpac bank but we were quite
concerned, if we did,
the Westpac bank would take the whole $25,000 for the home payments and we
needed money - I mean the people
in the local area had been very good to
us".
<P>

79	She said that the electricity and telephone services had been cut off a
number of times for non-payment of accounts.  She had
three children who were
still attending school.  During 1991 the household of herself and the plaintiff
had not received any income,
other than what had been received from the
defendant, "until we both went back to work and got jobs".
<P>

80	In cross-examination Wendy Miller was asked about the assertion in one of
her letters of 29 July 1991 that she was by that time
"gainfully employed". She
said that in June or July 1991 she had started working for a company on a
commission only basis.
<P>

81	Wendy Miller asserted that the plaintiff had wanted to commence legal
proceedings against the defendant earlier but that it had
been difficult for
her to have court proceedings brought, because James Shea was her brother,
"emotionally she was not up to court
proceedings" and she had no money.
<P>

82	Wendy Miller confirmed that the relationship between her husband and her
brother was bad.  She said that the defendant had tried
to stop her marrying
the plaintiff, that the defendant and her first husband had been good friends
and that the defendant had been
upset about her divorce, more so than either
her first husband or herself.
<P>

83	During cross-examination Wendy Miller insisted that the agreement for
Ladycare Services had  always been an agreement between
the plaintiff and the
defendant.  She said "the agreement was always between David and Jimmy", even
though she had been a participant
in a number of the conversations.  She said
that "the agreement was always that David was to get 40 per cent of the
business... the
only time that it ever became apparent that the shares were
going to be put into my name was when Jimmy didn't feel comfortable putting
them into David's name, because he still had this six monthly agreement with
Rentokil and Jimmy didn't feel comfortable about that
and David suggested, `if
you're not comfortable putting them into my name, put them into Wendy's name. I
don't care'". She denied
that it was part of the agreement that no transfer of
40 per cent of the shares was to take place, "unless and until Jimmy had
recouped
his initial investment from the funds available in the business".
Under the agreement "we were to be paid $5,000 per month for the
first twelve
months of the business".  It was put to her that the transfer of the shares was
to be for her own personal benefit and
she replied "no".
<P>

84	The following questions and answers occurred in her cross-examination:-
<P>

	"Q. What I suggest to you is that that was always the deal, that Jimmy was to
recoup his initial investment?
<P>

	A. Well I guess it was yes.
<P>

	Q. And he was to recoup his initial investment, before you would obtain any
shares in the company?
<P>

	A. No.  The original agreement was not that".
<P>

85	Later she was asked:
<P>

	"Even if you got the 40 per cent of the business and that 40 per cent was
sold, you would have to account to Jimmy out of that
sum for his capital
injection?"  and she replied "All right".
<P>

86	By the time Wendy Miller wrote her letters of 29 July 1991 "it was getting
to the desperation stage... David and I just wanted
to get out of it, because
it was causing us a lot of distress".
<P>

87	Wendy Miller denied that in the beginning the defendant had said words to
the effect "I'm only doing this for you Wendy".  The
defendant had said that
"later on when things got very heated".
<P>

88	Wendy Miller reaffirmed that "the initial agreement was that the shares were
to be assigned to David... I only came into the
picture with the 40 per cent,
when Jimmy wasn't comfortable to put the shares into David's name".  The
agreement was "between Jimmy
and David, not me".  It was agreed that the shares
would be transferred to Wendy Miller, "when things were starting to get very
messy".
Even that agreement had been made between the plaintiff and the
defendant.
<P>

89	Wendy Miller denied having lunch with the defendant on Friday 2 August 1991,
as the defendant asserted she had. She said:-
<P>

	"We didn't have lunch; we weren't going to ever have lunch. He said, `come in
and we'll discuss it'. There was never a mention
of having lunch, so we did
meet - or I went into the office, David drove me and I really believed we were
going to sit down and discuss
the terms of the letter that I sent and hopefully
come to some sort of agreement and that day, when I arrived, Jimmy met me at
the
top of the stairs and said he didn't want me on the premises any more and
that there was no point in discussing any more and my things
were in a box and
James (the defendant's son) would take them down to the car for me and he
didn't want me on the premises any more
and there was never a discussion, there
was never a meeting".
<P>

90	By August 1991 her "overriding concern was merely to get out of this company
and its affairs".  She was cross-examined about
a telephone conversation she
had had with the defendant. She agreed that she had told the defendant that she
did not want any more
upsets in the family and that she had said that the only
way was "to separate and not have anything further to do with the company".
She said "Jimmy, if it is not going to work, why don't we part company with
dignity?"  She also said to the defendant "do the right
thing for us and we
will call it quits... we will walk away".  Wendy Miller added in her evidence
"I honestly thought he would be
pleased that we were out of the company as well
and he would do the right thing by us and pay us out". She denied that she had
said
to the defendant that she would "walk away" for $25,000.  
<P>

91	Wendy Miller said that she had another conversation with the defendant,
which she said must have occurred on 16 August but was
probably the day before.
She said that during this conversation the following things were said.  She
said "Jimmy we need, you know,
you've got to help me out here.  We are
absolutely sinking".  The defendant said "well, what do you need to get out of
your initial
trouble, your initial debt?"  Wendy Miller said "around you know
$25,000 should see us out of our initial debt".
<P>

92	Wendy Miller was cross-examined about the signing of the deed of release.
She said that she did not know Mr McGonigal and denied
that Mr McGonigal had
been there.  She said that there had been no one else in the coffee shop, apart
from the staff of the coffee
shop.  She thought that the deed of release had
been witnessed by the person serving coffee.  When shown Mr McGonigal's
affidavit,
she was prepared to concede that the signature on the affidavit and
the signature of the witness on the deed of release "looked very
much the
same".  She described the circumstances as follows:-
<P>

	"We were merely to go in there, so Jimmy could give us a cheque to get us over
our immediate financial problems and we got in there,
he had this letter there,
and unless I signed the letter, he wasn't going to give us any money".
<P>

93	Wendy Miller conceded in cross-examination that she read the deed of
release, understood the general effect of the deed of release,
signed the deed
of release and accepted the cheque.  As regards the plaintiff she said "David
didn't want to sign the document...
he was really very annoyed, furious when we
got in there and he was confronted with the document".  Wendy Miller had said
to the
plaintiff "let's just sign and get the money because we need the
money".
<P>

94	In cross-examination Wendy Miller denied that she had been aware that if she
had a claim to shares in Ladycare Services her claim
would have been part of
her property vesting in the trustee of her bankrupt estate.
<P>

95	As regards the alleged obligation of the defendant to make periodical
payments of $5,000 per month, Wendy Miller said "it wasn't
me being paid $5,000
a month; it was for both of us to be in the business... I was coming in on a
very casual basis at that time,
because at the very beginning of Ladycare
Services I still had dealings doing Wendy Miller Enterprises.  It didn't happen
until late
1990/1991 that I came in and started selling Ladycare Services".
<P>

	<b>Defendant's Oral Evidence</b>
<P>

96	The defendant gave oral evidence in chief about entries in a diary which he
said he had kept.  The diary was a 1985 diary but
the defendant said he had
used it for the year 1991, when the days were the same as they had been in
1985.  The diary contains a
number of entries purportedly recording dealings
between the defendant and either the plaintiff or Wendy Miller.  The entry for
Friday
2 August 1991 is as follows:-
<P>

	"1pm. Had lunch with Wendy.  All went very well.  She said that she didn't
want anything from the business.  I said that I wanted
to pay her something
&amp; that her and David should talk about it &amp; get back to me with a
realistic figer.  All finished well
&amp; both were happy with our meeting.
Left aprox 3.15.
<P>

	PS. Wendy said they had offers for the bus. of around $80,000".
<P>

97	The defendant said in his evidence in chief about the lunch on 2 August
1991:-
<P>

	"It was a very happy and congenial lunch and Wendy actually said to me `I'm
just happy to be out of the business and David and
I are all right and we don't
want anything from the business.'"
<P>

98	Another entry in the diary, an entry for Sunday 4 August, was in the
following terms:-
<P>

	"9. pm Phone call Wendy saying her &amp; David had meeting &amp; they wanted
the 40% share signed over to them.  I said that I
would not do that on any
acount. Phone call lasted about &#190; hr.  She said offers around $60,000? I
told Wendy to phone at office
if they change their mind."
<P>

99	The defendant was cross-examined about the diary and the entries in the
diary.  There are very few entries in the diary, apart
from the entries
relating to the plaintiff or Wendy Miller. There was no entry in the diary
between 5 August (the date of the last
entry relating to the plaintiff or Wendy
Miller) and the end of the year, apart from one brief entry on 2 September,
which related
to an insurance matter.  The defendant said "I'm not a terribly
good diary keeper but most important things I keep in it".  Later
he said "I
don't enter a lot into a diary of that type".  He said nothing had happened
between 5 August and 31 December, apart from
the solitary happening on 2
September, which was important enough for him to make an entry in the diary.
The defendant could not
recall whether he had kept a diary in the previous year
1990.  Any such diary might be at his office but "I'm not saying it is".
<P>

100	The entries in the diary all have a similar appearance.  The following
questions and answers occurred in cross-examination of
the defendant:-
<P>

	"Q.	Would you have a look at the entries and I would like to refer you to the
way in which they are put in and the pen in which
they are put in and now try
and remember whether or not you put them all in at the same time?
<P>

	A.	No...
<P>

	Q.	Were these entries in the diary put in by you in late 1995 after you
received the statement of claim in these proceedings?
<P>

	A.	No I would say not".
<P>

101	The defendant accepted that there had been other conversations with the
plaintiff or Wendy Miller, which had not been recorded
in the diary.  For
example, the defendant had not recorded any conversation with Wendy Miller
concerning the payment of $25,000.
 The defendant accepted that that would have
been an important conversation and should have been recorded in the diary but
had not
been so recorded.
<P>

102	On 2 May 1991 the defendant had had a meeting with Mr Crosby, the managing
director of Rentokil, in which discussions had taken
place with a view to
avoiding further court hearings in the proceedings brought by Rentokil.  The
only entry the defendant made in
his diary was to record Mr Crosby's name "Mr
Bill Crosby".  There are in fact no summaries of any conversations in the
diary, apart
from the summaries of certain of the conversations between the
defendant and either the plaintiff or Wendy Miller.
<P>

103	The defendant agreed that the plaintiff had been employed by Rentokil and
that he had been managing a branch of Rentokil's business
providing sanitary
disposal and hygienic services.  The defendant accepted that the plaintiff's
function in the joint venture was
to start Ladycare Services, to manage
Ladycare Services and to make Ladycare Services grow.  The plaintiff was to
"totally run the
business".  The following questions and answers occurred in
the defendant's cross-examination.
<P>

	"Q.	What was the deal for David Miller then, what was he going to get out of
leaving his job with Rentokil and going to work for
Ladycare Services, what was
in it for him?
<P>

	A.	I think that arrangement and I didn't go into this.. would have been
between him and his wife.
<P>

	*  *  *
<P>

	A. 	I am saying the shares were Wendy's but the arrangements between Wendy and
David was their own affair not mine."
<P>

104	Later in the cross-examination the following question and answer
occurred:-
<P>

	"Q.	Are you saying that David Miller, who you accepted at the time had
expertise in this kind of business and who was the person
that was being
engaged to manage the business, who was going to start work giving up the
career that he had... on the basis that
he was not going to be paid a salary,
he was not going to be paid commission, he was not going to be paid any money
or get any shares
or interest in the business, he was just going to be there.
Is that the arrangement you say you understood he had with you...?
<P>

	A.	Absolutely."
<P>

105	The defendant denied that he had incurred any obligation to pay money to
the plaintiff or Wendy Miller.  The plaintiff's remuneration
was to have come
out of the 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services that Wendy Miller
would eventually have got and what he
personally received would depend on what
agreement he had with Wendy Miller. 
<P>

106	The defendant was asked "what were they (the plaintiff and his wife) going
to live on?" and the defendant replied "I don't really
know that that was my
problem".
<P>

107	The defendant was asked "so the income that the Miller family had prior to
that (that is prior to the plaintiff giving up his
job at Rentokil) would be
non-existent?" to which the defendant replied "I would not know that".
<P>

108	The defendant agreed that he had not given the plaintiff or Wendy Miller
any warning that he would be taking a deed of release
to the meeting on 16
August 1991.  The defendant was cross-examined about what he knew of Mr and Mrs
Miller's financial position
in August 1991.  The following questions and
answers occurred:-
<P>

	"Q.	At the time you knew the Millers were broke, didn't you?
<P>

	A.	I cannot say that I did know.  I did not look after their finances, I don't
know.
<P>

	Q.	You believed they were broke, didn't you?
<P>

	A.	I cannot say that I had much thought about it, to be honest.
<P>

	Q.	Had you thought about how they had lived over the past twelve months?
<P>

	A.	It had concerned me because Wendy had asked me for some advances from time
to time.
<P>

	Q.	You knew they were desperate for money in August 1991 didn't you?
<P>

	A.	I don't know how you define desperate.
<P>

	...
<P>

	Q.	You knew they were desperately in need of money to pay some bills didn't
you?
<P>

	A.	I would say no.
<P>

	Q.	Wendy had told you that they were in desperate need of money to pay bills
didn't she?
<P>

	A.	No".
<P>

109	The defendant denied that Wendy Miller had told him that her family was in
desperate need of money and that she needed $25,000
to cover immediate bills.
The defendant said that he did not know "until some time later" that Mr and Mrs
Miller had a mortgage on
their house, even though he knew at some stage that a
Mr and Mrs Sykes (Mrs Sykes was a sister of the defendant and Wendy Miller)
had
guaranteed the mortgage on the Miller's house. The defendant was cross-examined
about the passage in one of Wendy Miller's letters
of 29 July 1991 in which she
had said "to ensure my family does not have to carry on with the heartache,
poor health and financial
difficulties that we have endured".  The defendant
said that he had read that letter "but I really didn't know or think too much
of financial difficulties really".  The defendant accepted that he had made a
number of payments to Wendy Miller, after receiving
requests from her for
money.  He had not asked the plaintiff why he had taken the step of cashing a
cheque for $4,000, saying "do
you ask a bank robber why they rob a bank".
<P>

110	After this survey of some of the evidence of the three principal witnesses,
it is appropriate that I make some findings about
the credibility of these
witnesses.  In my opinion, none of the three principal witnesses was a fully
reliable witness.  Each of
the plaintiff and the defendant displayed a marked
antipathy for the other and this antipathy affected their evidence.  Each of
the
plaintiff and the defendant gave a number of pieces of evidence which I am
satisfied were clearly untrue.  For example, the plaintiff
denied that his
taking of the company's files in June 1991 had caused the final breakdown of
the relationship between the defendant
and himself, the plaintiff said that the
defendant had consented in advance to the plaintiff taking Ladycare Services'
cheques and
the plaintiff said that the deed of release was witnessed by
someone serving in the coffee shop.  On the other hand, the defendant
claimed
not to know that from October 1990 the plaintiff would have ceased receiving
the income he had been receiving when he was
employed by Rentokil and claimed
not to know that the plaintiff and his wife had a mortgage on their house.
Wendy Miller also gave
some evidence which was clearly untrue. For example,
like her husband she said that she thought that the deed of release had been
witnessed by a person serving in the coffee shop.  
<P>

111	Each of the three principal witnesses had fixed and strongly expressed
opinions on some matters on which I have to reach a conclusion,
for example who
were the parties to the agreement which was made in or about June or July 1990
and who was the person to whom 40
per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
were to be transferred or at least who was the person who was to be
beneficially entitled
to those shares.  The views expressed by each of the
principal witnesses on such matters were expressed quite dogmatically, were
in
accordance with the interests of that witness in the outcome of the proceedings
and are, in my opinion, of limited assistance
to me. 
<P>

112	In a case where there is conflicting oral evidence about events which
occurred several years ago, a judge usually finds it of
assistance to have
regard to contemporaneous documents.  However, in the present case the
authenticity  of some apparently contemporaneous
documents, as being genuinely
contemporaneous, was challenged, including the plaintiff's letter of 11
September 1990, which the defendant
denied receiving, and the entries made by
the defendant in what he said was his 1991 diary.  I do not consider that I can
place much
weight on either the plaintiff's letter or the defendant's diary
entries.  The letter of 11 September 1990 is a highly convenient
letter for the
plaintiff to have written in the course of negotiations which were otherwise
conducted wholly orally.  The entries
by the defendant in what he said was his
1991 diary were attacked by counsel for the plaintiff as being "reconstructed
concoctions".
 It is at least suspicious that among the very few entries made
by the defendant in the diary are detailed, self-serving accounts
of some only
of the meetings or communications the defendant had with the plaintiff or Wendy
Miller.  The defendant was quite markedly
unimpressive, both in the terms of
his answers and in his demeanour, when being cross-examined about the diary.

<P>

113	I will now proceed to deal in turn with the issues which earlier in this
judgment I said arose from the pleadings.
<P>

	<b>1.	Who were the Parties to the Agreement</b>
<P>

114	As previously stated, it is clear that the party on one side of the
agreement was the defendant, James Shea.  The defendant's
wife, Mrs Jan Shea,
did not actively participate in the discussions which led to the setting up of
the business or in the carrying
on of the business.  In my opinion, there is no
comparison between her position and that of Wendy Miller.
<P>

115	The principal witnesses gave conflicting evidence about who was the party,
or who were the parties, on the other side of the
agreement.  Each of the
plaintiff and Wendy Miller gave evidence to the effect that the agreement had
at all times been an agreement
between the plaintiff and the defendant.  The
late amendment to the statement of claim, alleging, in the alternative, that
Wendy
Miller had also been a party to the agreement, was sought, only in case
the Court found, contrary to the evidence of the plaintiff
and Wendy Miller,
that Wendy Miller had been a party to the agreement.  As previously observed,
the position adopted by the plaintiff
and Wendy Miller, that Wendy Miller had
not been a party to the agreement, had advantages for the plaintiff and Wendy
Miller, connected
with the deed of release and Wendy Miller's bankruptcy.  The
defendant maintained in his evidence that the only party on the other
side of
the agreement was his sister Wendy Miller.
<P>

116	In my opinion, Wendy Miller was at least one party to the agreement.  A
telling piece of evidence against the plaintiff is his
own evidence that,
having (according to him) been handed by the defendant a document setting out
an agreement the defendant had previously
entered into in an earlier, unrelated
venture and having been invited by the defendant to amend the document so that
the amended
document would constitute the agreement for the new business, the
plaintiff altered the document by deleting the name of a party
to the previous
agreement and substituting in his own handwriting "Wendy Miller Enterprises", a
business name of which Wendy Miller
was the sole proprietor and in which the
plaintiff had no interest.
<P>

117	The terms of the letters written by Wendy Miller to the defendant on 29
July 1991, which were read by the plaintiff before they
were sent and which
were not the subject of any objection by the plaintiff, are consistent only
with a view that Wendy Miller, at
least by the time the letters were written
(and, in my opinion, originally as well) was a party to the agreement and would
indeed
lend some support to a view that she and the defendant were the only
parties to the agreement.
<P>

118	I have, however, reached the conclusion that David Miller did become a
party to the agreement for the new business.  He was
the only person with
expertise in the line of business which was to be undertaken in the new
venture.  After the initial contact
between Wendy Miller and the defendant,
David Miller participated and took a leading part in all the discussions about
the venture.
 Under the agreement which was arrived at he assumed the
obligation of devoting himself full-time to managing the affairs of the
new
company.  
<P>

119	My conclusion that both the plaintiff and Wendy Miller were parties to the
agreement does not determine questions of the extent
of their participation in
the agreement, including whether certain promises made by the defendant were
made to them jointly or only
to one of them severally and accordingly whether
such promises made by the defendant are enforceable by both of them or only by
one
of them.
<P>

	<b>2. To whom were 40 per cent of shares in Ladycare Services to be
transferred</b>
<P>

120	It was common ground in the evidence that, subject to the fulfilment of any
condition precedent (a matter to which I will return
later in this judgment)
the defendant was to cause 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services to be
transferred.  The issues
to be decided are whether the shares were to be
transferred to David Miller or Wendy Miller or both of them and if the shares
were
to be transferred to Wendy Miller, whether they were to be transferred to
her in her own right or merely as a nominee of David Miller.
<P>

121	It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that it should be inferred that
the plaintiff would not have abandoned his job at
Rentokil and assumed the
heavy responsibility of managing the business of the new company, except on the
basis that he was to receive
some personal benefit.  It was contended on behalf
of the defendant that the defendant had made it clear at the outset that he was
"only doing this for you Wendy" and what benefit the plaintiff would personally
receive would depend on what private arrangement
was made between the plaintiff
and his wife in relation to the 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
she was to receive.
 
<P>

122	In my opinion, it is clear that the person to whom 40 per cent of the
shares were to be transferred was Wendy Miller.  The plaintiff
gave evidence
that the shares were originally to be transferred to him but even he said that
at about the end of March 1991 he had
agreed that the 40 per cent of the shares
in Ladycare Services could be transferred to Wendy Miller.  It is clear from
the defendants
solicitor's letter of 19 July 1991, a copy of which was annexed
to the plaintiff's own affidavit, that the demand made in July 1991
by Eddy
McCausland &amp; Walker, the solicitors acting for Mr and Mrs Miller, was that
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
be issued or transferred to Mrs
Miller.  The letters written by Wendy Miller on 29 July 1991 are clear in their
terms.  Para 1 of
the second letter reads:-
<P>

	"1. Shares to be assigned as agreed, to Wendy Miller equal to 40 per cent of
the business".
<P>

123	In the second letter Wendy Miller says "you will also be aware that<b>
I</b> (my emphasis) can only negotiate 40 per cent of the business with
interested parties".  The plaintiff read Wendy Miller's letters
of 29 July
1991, before they were sent to the defendant and he did not make any complaint
or objection that the shares in Ladycare
Services were "his", and not Wendy
Miller's, or that it was beyond the power of Wendy Miller to negotiate for a
sale of the interest
she claimed in Ladycare Services.
<P>

124	The documents prepared on behalf of the defendant in July and August 1991
consistently referred to Mrs Miller as being the only
person who could have an
entitlement to the disputed shares.  I have already referred to the letter from
the defendant's solicitors
of 19 July 1991.  In the draft minutes of the
meeting of Ladycare Services to be held on 18 July 1991 (a document annexed to
the
plaintiff's affidavit), it is "Mrs Miller's entitlement to a 40 per cent
interest in the company" which is acknowledged.  In the
deed of release of 16
August 1991 it is Mrs Miller's claim to be entitled to the ownership of shares
in Ladycare Services which is
recited. 
<P>

125	I conclude that under the agreement, both initially or even if not
initially then from about March 1991, the person to whom
40 per cent of the
shares in Ladycare Services were to be transferred was Mrs Miller and Mrs
Miller in her own right, not as a nominee
of the plaintiff.  
<P>

	<b>3. To whom was the promise made by the defendant to transfer 40 per cent of
the shares and could the promise be enforced by the sole
plaintiff, Mr
Miller</b>
<P>

126	My findings that Mr Miller was a party to the agreement and that the shares
were to be transferred to Mrs Miller do not decide
this issue.  The promise to
transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services to Mrs Miller could
have been a promise made
only to Mrs Miller, notwithstanding that Mr Miller was
also a party to the agreement, or could have been a promise made to Mr Miller
and Mrs Miller jointly. I do not consider that it could be regarded as having
been a promise made only to Mr Miller, particularly
in the light of the various
documents brought into existence in July or August 1991.  
<P>

127	If the promise was made only to Mrs Miller, then only she could enforce the
promise and she would have to be joined as a party
in any proceedings to
enforce the promise.  Mrs Miller was never joined as a party in the present
proceedings, notwithstanding remarks
made by me in the course of the hearing
that difficulties could arise from the non-joinder of Mrs Miller.  It may be
that the decision
not to join Mrs Miller was influenced by the consideration
that, as was conceded by counsel for the plaintiff, any claim she had
under the
agreement would have vested in her trustee in bankruptcy and would have
remained vested in her trustee in bankruptcy, notwithstanding
her subsequent
discharge.
<P>

128	In my opinion, the promise to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in
Ladycare Services to Mrs Miller was a promise made to her
alone, which only she
could enforce.  As I have held, Mrs Miller was the only person who was to
receive the shares and she was to
receive the shares in her own right.  Mrs
Miller's letters of 29 July 1991, which the plaintiff read and of which the
plaintiff did
not disapprove, strongly indicate that the only parties to the
promise to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
were the
defendant as promissor and Mrs Miller as promisee.  Accordingly, I conclude
that the present proceedings for damages for
breach of the promise to transfer
40 per cent of the shares must fail, on the simple ground that Mr Miller cannot
enforce a promise
made to someone else, even if that other person is his
wife.
<P>

129	If, contrary to the conclusion I have just reached, the promise to transfer
shares in Ladycare Services to Mrs Miller was made
to Mr Miller and Mrs Miller
jointly, the question would arise whether Mr Miller could enforce such a
promise and obtain a substantive
award of damages for breach of such a promise,
without Mrs Miller having being joined as a party to the proceedings.  
<P>

130	Pt8 r3 of the Supreme Court Rules provides in part that where a plaintiff
claims relief to which any other person is entitled
jointly with him, all
persons so entitled shall be parties to the action.  The rule is expressed to
be subject to s62 of the <i>Bankruptcy Act</i>, which provides that where a
bankrupt is a contractor in respect of a contract jointly with another person
or other persons, that
person or those persons may sue or be sued in respect of
the contract without the joinder of the bankrupt.  Counsel for the plaintiff
sought to rely on s62 of the <i>Bankruptcy Act</i> as justifying the
non-joinder of Mrs Miller.
<P>

131	I was not referred to any authority on s62 of the <i>Bankruptcy Act </i>and
the extent of its operation is not clear.  For example, it is unclear whether
it applies to a contract entered into by a person
before he or she became a
bankrupt and whether it continues to apply after a person has ceased to be a
bankrupt.
<P>

132	However, whatever the extent of the operation of s62 of the <i>Bankruptcy
Act</i> and notwithstanding the provision in the Supreme Court Rules (Pt8 r7)
that proceedings shall not be defeated by reason of the non-joinder
of any
person as a party, I do not consider that, even if the promise to transfer the
shares was made to the plaintiff and Mrs Miller
jointly, the plaintiff can
enforce the promise and obtain substantive damages for breach of the promise,
where he is not the person
who under the agreement would have received the
benefit of the promise if it had been performed, and the person who under the
agreement
would have received the benefit of the promise, if it had been
performed, has subsequently become bankrupt, with the consequence
that that
person's claim to enforce the promise became and has remained vested in her
trustee in bankruptcy.  
<P>

133	I am accordingly of the opinion that whether the promise to transfer 40 per
cent of the shares in Ladycare Services was made
to Mrs Miller solely or to Mr
Miller and Mrs Miller jointly, the present proceedings brought by Mr Miller
alone must fail.
<P>

134	Although I have decided that for the reasons I have just given the present
proceedings must fail, I will proceed to deal with
other issues which arose.
<P>

	<b>4. What were the conditions which had to be fulfilled before an obligation
arose to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare
Services and were those
conditions fulfilled.</b>
<P>

135	The plaintiff gave evidence that the shares were to be transferred after
six months, either six months after Ladycare Services
commenced carrying on
business or six months after the termination of his employment by Rentokil.
Whether the period of six months
was calculated from the date of Ladycare
Services commencing to carry on business or from the date of the plaintiff's
employment
by Rentokil being terminated, the period would have expired by the
end of March 1991 or by the beginning of April 1991.  
<P>

136	The defendant gave evidence that the obligation to transfer 40 per cent of
the shares in Ladycare Services would arise, only
after Ladycare Services had
attained "profit maturity" and had repaid to the defendant out of its reserves
the full amount of the
initial capital injection by the defendant and that this
condition had not been fulfilled by August 1991.  The defendant said that
the
plaintiff had assured him in their negotiations that the new company would
become self supporting in two months, so that a condition
which would defer the
transfer of the shares until the new company had reached profit maturity would
not have been unduly onerous
to the plaintiff or Wendy Miller.  
<P>

137	I do not consider that I should accept the defendant's evidence on this
matter.  In the defendant's solicitor's letter of 19
July 1991 and in the draft
minutes of the meeting of Ladycare Services to be held on 18 July 1991 the
defendant, while acknowledging
that Mrs Miller was entitled to 40 per cent of
the shares in Ladycare Services, refused to cause 40 per cent of the shares in
Ladycare
Services to be issued or transferred to her.  However, the reason
given in both the letter and in the draft minutes for the refusal
to issue or
transfer shares to Mrs Miller was, not that Ladycare Services had not yet
attained profit maturity or that any condition
precedent had not been
fulfilled, but "the current state of things between Mr and Mrs Miller and Mr
Shea" or "the conflict having
arisen" (between Mr and Mrs Miller and Mr Shea).
If it was truly a condition of Mrs Miller becoming entitled to a transfer of 40
per cent of the shares that Ladycare Services should have attained profit
maturity and that the defendant should have been repaid
out of reserves the
full amount of the initial capital injection, then I would have expected that
to have been stated in the defendant's
solicitor's letter, when the solicitors
were replying to a demand that 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
be transferred
to Mrs Miller.
<P>

138	In my opinion, any conditions which had to be fulfilled before an
obligation arose to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in
Ladycare Services had
been fulfilled by July 1991.  I consider that I should proceed on the basis,
which was the basis contended
for by the plaintiff, that the promise had become
absolute by April 1991 and that the defendant, by not transferring the shares,
had committed a breach of his promise in April 1991.
<P>

	<b>5. On the true construction of the deed of release did the deed of release
bar claims only by Wendy Miller (as alleged by the plaintiff)
or claims by both
David Miller and Wendy Miller (as alleged by the defendant).</b>
<P>

139	The plaintiff accepted that the deed of release, if valid, barred any claim
by Mrs Miller to shares in Ladycare Services.  However,
it was submitted on
behalf of the plaintiff that the deed of release, properly construed, did not
bar claims by Mr Miller to shares
in Ladycare Services.  Of course, such a
submission would not really assist the plaintiff, if, as I have held, the only
person who
had a claim to shares in Ladycare Services was Mrs Miller.  The
argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiff was that the operative
clauses in
a release can be limited by the recitals; that in the present case the only
recital of a claim to ownership of shares
in Ladycare Services was recital C,
which referred only to a claim by Wendy Miller; and that consequently the
general words in the
first operative clause of the deed should be read down so
as not to bar a claim by David Miller to ownership of shares in Ladycare
Services.
<P>

140	I do not consider that this submission should be accepted.  The deed of
release is a short, simple document.  Recital E provided
that the parties to
the deed, that is the plaintiff, Wendy Miller and the defendant, had agreed to
settle all disputes between them
and the first operative clause provided that
David Miller and Wendy Miller release Ladycare Services and the defendant from
all claims
against Ladycare Services or the defendant.  I do not consider that
the general words in recital E and the general words in the first
operative
clause should be read down by reference to recital C.  In my opinion, the deed
of release on its true construction barred
all claims by David Miller or Wendy
Miller.  If the deed of release cannot be invalidated, the deed of release is a
complete defence
to all claims made in the present proceedings.
<P>

	<b>6. Was the deed of release "vitiated" by economic duress and unconscionable
conduct on the part of the defendant. </b>
<P>

141	Counsel for the plaintiff referred to <b>Equiticorp Finance Limited (in
liquidation) v Bank of New Zealand </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 50.</a>  In
<b>Equiticorp</b> Clarke JA and Cripps JA referred with approval at 149-150 to
what McHugh JA said in <b>Crescendo Management Pty Limited v Westpac Banking
Corporation </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2019%20NSWLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 19 NSWLR 40</a> at 45-56, where his Honour said:-
<P>

	"A person who is the subject of duress usually knows only too well what he is
doing.  But he chooses to submit to the demand or
pressure rather than take an
alternative course of action.  A proper approach in my opinion is to ask
whether any applied pressure
induced the victim to enter into the contract and
then ask whether that pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to
countenance
as legitimate?  Pressure will be illegitimate if it consists of
unlawful threats or amounts to unconscionable conduct.  But the categories
are
not closed.  Even overwhelming pressure, not amounting to unconscionable or
unlawful conduct, however, will not necessarily constitute
economic duress".
<P>

142	I have already earlier in this judgment summarised the particulars the
plaintiff supplied of the claim that the deed of release
was invalidated by
economic duress.  It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that all of
those particulars had been established
by the evidence.
<P>

143	I consider that I should find that in August 1991 the plaintiff and Wendy
Miller were in financial difficulty.  Their household
consisted of themselves
and three school age children.  During the first half of 1991 both had worked
full-time in the business of
Ladycare Services, Wendy Miller having ceased to
carry on her own business, and the only remuneration they had received
consisted
of the sporadic payments made by the defendant to Wendy Miller.  The
plaintiff had not personally received any remuneration since
ceasing to work
for Rentokil in September 1990.  
<P>

144	I am also satisfied that I should find that the defendant was aware that
the plaintiff and Wendy Miller were in financial difficulty.
 The defendant
denied being aware of this or even that the plaintiff and his wife had a
mortgage on their home but I am satisfied
that these parts of his evidence were
untrue.  The defendant would have been aware that the plaintiff and Wendy
Miller had been working
full-time in the business for many months without
remuneration, except that the defendant had, at intervals and in response to
requests
by Wendy Miller for money, made sporadic payments to her.
<P>

145	I am also satisfied that the plaintiff and Wendy Miller were given no
warning about the deed of release, which the defendant
had had his solicitors
prepare.  At the meeting at the coffee shop the plaintiff and Wendy Miller were
confronted with the deed of
release and presented by the defendant with the
choice of signing the deed of release or not receiving the $25,000.  No
opportunity
was given to them to negotiate or to obtain legal advice.  
<P>

146	What I have said so far would indicate a case for the plaintiff that the
deed of release was vitiated by economic duress.  I
have, however, reached a
conclusion that economic duress has not been established.  
<P>

147	Although I have found that the plaintiff and Wendy Miller were in financial
difficulty, I do not accept that the evidence establishes
that in August 1991
they were in "dire financial straits".  As counsel for the defendant submitted,
the oral evidence of the plaintiff
and Wendy Miller was vague and not supported
by any documents.  The defendant had between 2 November 1990 and 27 June 1991
made the
payments to Wendy Miller which he listed in his affidavit.  Wendy
Miller's first husband had made some contribution to the expenses
of her
children.  Notwithstanding the plaintiff and Wendy Miller's expressed concern
about Westpac appropriating the sum of $25,000
for mortgage payments, Westpac
did not appropriate any part of the $25,000, when it was deposited into a
Westpac account within a
couple of days of 16 August 1991.  The proceedings by
American Express on which Wendy Miller was made bankrupt were not commenced
until more than a year after August 1991.  In one of her letters of 29 July
1991 to the defendant Wendy Miller said "David and I
are both now gainfully
employed therefore please do not worry about that aspect" and it was in fact
true that both the plaintiff
and Wendy Miller had obtained other employment.
Although I have held that the defendant was aware that the plaintiff and Wendy
Miller
were in financial difficulty, the defendant would have believed,
reasonably, that the plaintiff and Wendy Miller had both found other
employment.
<P>

148	Although Wendy Miller denied it, I consider it probable that in a telephone
conversation or conversations with the defendant
in August 1991 there was
discussion between her and the defendant regarding the payment of a sum of
money by the defendant not, or
not merely, as a fund for paying the immediate
debts of the plaintiff and Wendy Miller but as a consideration for Wendy Miller
relinquishing
any interest in Ladycare Services.  Wendy Miller had been making
apparently unsuccessful attempts in June and July 1991 to find a
purchaser of
the company's business or of the shares in the company or the shares in the
company to which she claimed to be entitled.
 Wendy Miller agreed that by
August 1991 her "overriding concern was merely to get out of the company and
its affairs".  She agreed
that in a telephone conversation with the defendant
she had said that the only way was "to separate and not have anything further
to do with the company".  She had said to the defendant "Jimmy, if it is not
going to work, why don't we part company with dignity?"
  She had said to the
defendant "do the right thing for us and we will call it quits... we will walk
away".
<P>

149	The plaintiff and Wendy Miller are incorrect in at least one part of their
recollection of what happened at the coffee shop,
in saying the deed of release
was witnessed by a person serving in the coffee shop.  It is clear that Mr
McGonigal's initials appear
on the document and I consider that I should accept
his evidence that he was at the coffee shop and that he witnessed the
signatures
of the parties to the document and that, so far as he could see, "no
person gave the appearance of signing under duress".  On the
other hand, I have
serious reservations about whether Mr Hindmarsh had any real recollection of
the events he referred to in his
affidavit and I would place no weight on his
evidence.  
<P>

150	The sole plaintiff in the present proceedings is Mr Miller.  Mr Miller gave
evidence that he personally did not feel any pressure
to sign the deed of
release, although he was concerned about his wife who was distressed and upset.

<P>

151	The defendant gave evidence that on 16 August 1991, after the deed of
release had been signed, David Miller had handed him Mr
Aitkens' "valuation"
letter, saying "you might as well take this, as it is of no use to me".  Mr
Aitkens' letter is addressed to
Mr Miller and no other explanation has been
offered of how it came to be in the defendant's possession.  In the absence of
any other
explanation, I consider that I should accept the defendant's evidence
about how he got the document and this explanation is inconsistent
with what
the plaintiff and Wendy Miller say was the tone of the meeting.
<P>

152	I have concluded that although the plaintiff and Wendy Miller had had no
warning that they would have to sign a deed of release,
they were willing to
give up such rights as they had in consideration of payment of sum of $25,000.
I consider that their present
recollection of the circumstances surrounding the
execution of the deed of release may be coloured by their awareness of how
Ladycare
Services has prospered in the years since the deed of release was
signed.
<P>

153	In my opinion economic duress has not been established.
<P>

	<b>7. If an obligation on the defendant to transfer 40 per cent of the shares
in Ladycare Services had crystallised and had not been
performed and damages
amounting to the value of 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services were
to be assessed, should the value
of the shares be determined as at the date of
the defendant's breach of contract (which on the plaintiff's case was in about
April
1991) or as of now and what, at the appropriate time, was or is the value
of 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services.</b>
<P>

154	If the promise to transfer 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
was enforceable by the plaintiff and if, as I have
found, the conditions for
the performance of that promise were fulfilled and if the plaintiff was not
bound by the deed of release,
then the question would arise of what damages the
plaintiff would be entitled to for breach of the defendant's promise.
<P>

155	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff was entitled to have
damages assessed at the current value of 40 per
cent of the shares in Ladycare
Services.  The plaintiff relied on a valuation by a chartered accountant, Mr
Jugmans, dated 29 or
30 July 1998, in which Mr Jugmans calculated the value of
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services as being between $1,415,000
and
$1,540,000.  At the beginning of his report Mr Jugmans recorded that his
instructions had been "to provide our opinion as to
the value of the equity in
the company Ladycare Services...as at the most recent possible date" and it is
clear that Mr Jugmans'
valuation was intended to be a current valuation.  It
was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that it was appropriate to assess
damages at the current value of 40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services,
because "the plaintiff if successful is entitled
to an asset but is not given
that asset.  The asset, albeit changed, still exists and has a current day
value".
<P>

156	The defendant adduced a report by Mr Brian James, a chartered accountant,
in which Mr James noted that his instructions had
been to review and comment on
Mr Jugmans's valuation and in his report Mr James dealt with Mr Jugmans's
report as being a current
valuation of shares in Ladycare Services.
<P>

157	However, while relying on Mr James's report in the event of the Court
holding that damages should be assessed at the current
value of shares in
Ladycare Services, counsel for the defendant submitted that damages should be
assessed as at the date when the
breach of contract had occurred and that,
accordingly, if the plaintiff's contention about the date when the breach of
contract had
occurred was accepted, what had to be determined was the value of
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services as at April 1991.
 
<P>

158	In <b>Johnson v Perez</b> (19988-89) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=166%20CLR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">166 CLR 351</a> Mason CJ said at
355-6:-
<P>

	"There is a general rule that damages for torts or breach of contract are
assessed as at the date of breach or when the cause of
action arises.  But this
rule is not universal; it must give way in particular cases to solutions best
adapted to giving an injured
plaintiff that amount in damages which will most
fairly compensate him for the wrong he has suffered....One established
exception
to the general rule relates to the assessment of damages for personal
injury...The general rule that damages are assessed as at the
date of breach or
when the cause of action arose has been applied more uniformly in contract than
in tort and for good reason.  But
even in contract cases courts depart from the
general rule whenever it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice".
<P>

159	I do not consider that in the present case it is necessary in the interest
of justice to depart from the general rule.  The
plaintiff last did any work
for Ladycare Services in June 1991.  Wendy Miller last did any work for
Ladycare Services in August 1991.
 In August 1991 Wendy Miller was prepared to
"walk away from Ladycare Services" and "call it quits".  She had been
endeavouring to
find a purchaser for whatever interest she had in Ladycare
Services.  The plaintiff waited more than four years before commencing
these
proceedings, which were commenced on 26 September 1995.  Another three years
elapsed before the proceedings came on for hearing.
 In the meantime between
1991 and the present, according to the unchallenged evidence of the defendant,
Ladycare Services had been
"rebuilt" and transformed and had been rebuilt and
transformed as a result of the defendant's efforts.  The defendant had changed
the method of manufacturing sanitary bins.  The defendant had familiarised
himself with new technology.  The defendant had introduced
a computerised
operation system.  The defendant had expanded the range of products Ladycare
Services provided.  The defendant had
made a number of innovations in the
business.  The defendant had obtained most of the current clients of the
business.  The company
under the defendant's administration had adapted to the
usual form of client contract being radically changed.  The company's staff
had
expanded many times.  In my opinion, what has to be determined is the value of
40 per cent of the shares in Ladycare Services
as at April 1991.  It is
accordingly unnecessary for me to resolve the differences of opinion between Mr
Jugmans and Mr James concerning
how shares in Ladycare Services should
currently be valued, although, if I had to do so, I would, for the reasons
given by Mr James,
prefer his opinions.
<P>

160	Mr James was asked how he would value shares in Ladycare Services as at 30
June 1991. Having examined Ladycare Services' accounts
for the period from the
commencement of business to 30 June 1991 Mr James said:-
<P>

	"If you were valuing this company at 30 June 1991 in my view the only way you
could value this company at that point in time would
be on a net asset basis
because you can't use maintainable earnings when there hasn't been any history
of earnings.  At June 1991
the profit for the - the result for the year is a
loss of $159,954.  Any valuer asked to do a valuation at that point in time
would
have to approach it on the basis that you have no history of making a
profit and the only way that you can value a company that has
no history of
that is to value it on a net asset basis, what assets you have there and you
would have to value Ladycare at 30 June
1991 as worthless because it's actually
got more liabilities than assets".
<P>

161	Mr James said that this expression of opinion would not be affected by the
circumstance that in the period ended 30 June 1991
Ladycare Services had
received income in advance for contracts which it had written.  He said inter
alia:-
<P>

	"I don't know whether that company in getting into the market place might have
done those contracts at a rate that wouldn't enable
them to earn a profit and
that's not uncommon in a start up situation".
<P>

162	Counsel for the plaintiff sought to rely on Mr Aitkens' "valuation" as
being some evidence of the value of shares in Ladycare
Services as at the date
of breach.  This letter from Mr Aitken had found its way into evidence as an
annexure to one of Mr Shea's
affidavits and had not been tendered as being any
evidence of the value of shares in Ladycare Services but as going to another
issue.
 Counsel for the defendant expressly disavowed relying on Mr Aitkens'
letter as being any evidence of value.
<P>

163	I do not consider that I can place any reliance on Mr Aitkens' letter as
evidence of the value of shares in Ladycare Services
as at April 1991.  The
letter purports to be a valuation of the "business" conducted by Ladycare
Services as a guide to what might
be paid for the business on a going concern
basis and does not purport to be a valuation of the shares in the company
carrying on
the business.  In fact, what Mr Aitken did in his letter was to
attempt to determine the present value as at July 1991 of the estimated
adjusted net revenues of Ladycare Services for the period from July 1991 to
October 1992.  As Mr Jugmans said, "in fact, what he
(Mr Aitken) has done is
simply pre-value the net revenue of the business for the period from July 1991
to October 1992".  In preparing
the letter Mr Aitken relied on information
supplied by the plaintiff for the company's revenue and expenses and the
figures supplied
by the plaintiff varied greatly from the actual revenue and
expenses of Ladycare Services as recorded in its formal accounts for
the period
ended 30 June 1991.  
<P>

164	An attempt was made by counsel for the plaintiff to obtain from Mr Jugmans
an off the cuff valuation of 40 per cent of the shares
in Ladycare Services
which would be based on Mr Aitken's figures.  However, in cross-examination Mr
Jugmans made it clear that he
was not prepared, on the information available to
him, to offer any opinion of his own about the value of shares in Ladycare
Services
as at 30 June 1991 or as at an earlier date such as April 1991.
<P>

<b>165	</b>It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that since April or June
1991 Ladycare Services had in fact prospered and that "to value
something at a
particular date it is permissible to take into account what has actually
happened since that date".  Reference was
made to authorities in other areas of
the law, such as <b>Bwllfa v Merthyr Dare Stream Colleries (1891) Limited v
Pontypridd Waterworks Co </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281903%29%20AC%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1903) AC 426.</a>  However, this submission is
contrary to established principle in valuation law.  See <b>Spencer v
Commonwealth of Australia</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/82.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] HCA 82</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%205%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907) 5 CLR 418.</a>
<P>

<b>166	</b>In my opinion, it has not been established that shares in Ladycare
Services had any value in April 1991 and accordingly, even if the
plaintiff was
entitled to a verdict, it would only be for a nominal amount.
<P>

<b>	8. Had the defendant promised to make monthly payments of $5,000 for twelve
months or had the defendant promised only to make a single
payment of $5,000
and could such a promise be enforced by the sole plaintiff David Miller.</b>
<P>

167	I am satisfied that the promise was to make payments for twelve months but
that the promise was a promise made solely to Wendy
Miller to pay her $5,000
per month.  These conclusions are supported by para 2 of Wendy Miller's second
letter of 29 July 1991. 
Even in the amended statement of claim the promise the
plaintiff alleges was made was a promise to pay Wendy Miller and not the
plaintiff.
 The first payment which was made on 2 November 1990 and all of the
subsequent payments which were made were made to Wendy Miller
and not the
plaintiff.  
<P>

168	As the promise was made solely to Wendy Miller, the promise cannot be
enforced in the present proceedings in which David Miller
is the sole
plaintiff.  Even if the promise to make payments to Wendy Miller was a promise
made to the plaintiff and Wendy Miller
jointly, then in my opinion the promise
cannot be enforced so as to produce a substantive award of damages in
proceedings in which
David Miller is the sole plaintiff, particularly where
Wendy Miller's claim (if any) would have become vested in a trustee in
bankruptcy.
<P>

169	The promise to make payments would be barred by the deed of release unless
the deed of release could be invalidated.  
<P>

170	Even if the plaintiff was entitled to damages, the payments actually made
by the defendant would have to be offset against the
damages.
<P>

171	I hold that this part of the plaintiff's claim also fails.
<P>

172	In the proceedings generally there should be verdict for the defendant and
the plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs.
