<b><u>70009/99 - REGINA v KMD</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 27 January 1999 the prisoner, whom I shall
refer to by his initials KMD, was committed to this Court for trial on a number
of
serious offences, including murder and several counts of aggravated robbery.
On 1 October 1999 the Crown presented an indictment
containing two counts and
the prisoner pleaded guilty to them both.  They were that on 9 March 1998 at
Marrickville he robbed Toan
Van Doan of a gold chain, a wallet and some money
and at the same time used corporal violence upon him and that at the same time
and place he robbed Cong Hai Nguyen of a television receiver, a video cassette
recorder, some hi-fi equipment, two leather jackets,
a gold chain, a telephone
and a wallet and at the same time used corporal violence upon him.
<P>

2  	The prisoner was born on 12 September 1981, so he was sixteen and
a half years old when he committed the offences.  It is therefore
necessary to
have regard to the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987</a>
in imposing sentence.  By s 95 Crimes Act these offences attract a maximum
penalty of twenty years' penal servitude.  They are not
serious indictable
offences for the purposes of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act</a>:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 3</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">17</a>, reg 5.  In accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18</a> of the same Act, therefore, the Court may
deal with the prisoner according to law or in accordance with Div 4 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> of
the Act.
<P>

3  	On 9 March 1998 the prisoner and six other youths or young men
went together to a house in Marrickville where Cong Hai Nguyen
lived, intending
to buy heroin from him.  The others were Aaron Anderson, Michael Poa, David
Hooker and three youths to whom I shall
refer by their initials, which are PS,
SB and RA.
<P>

4  	A man called Duc Hoang Do was visiting Mr Nguyen at the time.
The prisoner and his colleagues purchased and smoked heroin and
while that was
going on one of them suggested that they rob Mr Nguyen and Mr Do.  They all
agreed.  As Mr Do walked into the lounge
room from the kitchen he was punched
by Michael Poa and knocked across the room.  He was there punched and kicked
and lay unconscious
in the corner of the room.  Mr Nguyen entered the lounge
room and he too was attacked, being kicked and punched in the face and in
the
head.  His trousers were ripped as his attackers removed his wallet and he was
kicked in the chest.  Some of the offenders began
to remove property from the
flat.  As that happened Mr Nguyen managed to get away.
<P>

5  	During the course of the robbery Toan Van Doan, another friend of
Mr Nguyen entered the flat.  He was forcibly carried into
a bedroom and
attacked.  He lost consciousness.
<P>

6  	During the attack David Hooker was searching a lounge chair,
hoping to find concealed drugs, and found a large knife.  He used
it to stab Mr
Do and Mr Doan.  Mr Do died of his wounds and Mr Doan was seriously hurt.  He
had to have thirty-seven sutures to the
head and had to undergo an operation to
remove a blood clot from his brain.
<P>

7  	The belongings which I mentioned earlier in summarising the
charges were removed by the attackers and they all got away in a
car.
<P>

8  	Although the prisoner joined in the attack and was thereby
responsible for the punching and kicking of Mr Doan and Mr Nguyen
it is no part
of the Crown case that the prisoner personally caused any injury.  Of course,
the finding of the knife by Hooker was
never contemplated by the prisoner and
it has not been suggested that he is responsible for injuries inflicted by its
use.
<P>

9  	I accept that the attack was launched on the spur of the moment
and that the only intent of the prisoner in going to the flat
was to purchase
heroin.
<P>

10  	The prisoner was born in South Vietnam and lived in that country
until 1989.  He went to primary school there.  He never knew
his father.  He
came to Australia in 1989 with his brother and they lived with their mother,
their step-father and their five children.
 Although the prisoner formed a
strong bond with his brother and his half brothers and sisters he never related
well to his step-father,
who was cruel and a drunkard.  He left home and lived
mainly on the streets, though he spent some time with his maternal grandparents
and some time in the Liverpool Youth Refuge.  His understanding of English was
poor and he did not do well in high school.  He was
dealt with in the
Children's Court in 1997 and 1998 for possessing a prohibited drug, possessing
car breaking implements, maliciously
destroying or damaging property and
entering a vehicle without consent.  Control and probation orders were made.
Apparently the first
serious attempt he made at any educational course was
during a period he spent at Mount Penang Juvenile Justice Centre in 1997.
<P>

11  	After his arrest on 1 April 1998 he went to Kariong Juvenile
Justice Centre and took up educational programs he had begun the
previous year
at Mount Penang.  He completed a number of courses including practical
courses.
<P>

12  	His experience in the juvenile justice system was not
trouble-free.  For the seventeen-month period between April 1998 and
October
1999 he was at Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre and Mr Harry Smith was his
crisis manager.  He was involved in about ten incidents,
ranging from hitting
other residents with a tennis racket to possessing tobacco.  He refused
instruction.  Five of the ten incidents
occurred during the first five months.
Even so, the prisoner was not considered a management problem by staff.
<P>

13  	Early in 1999 a program was introduced at Kariong in which
detainees who were involved in full-time or school programs and
whose behaviour
was of a good standard would be placed in a privileged unit.  The prisoner was
selected and maintained his place
in that unit for most of the year.  He
eventually became the elected unit representative, demonstrating a mature
approach to the
program and volunteering for necessary tasks.  Those in charge
of him were impressed and other detainees responded to his maturity
and
leadership.
<P>

14  	For most of time at Kariong he was in school full-time.  He was
always polite and co-operative with his crisis manager, prepared
to answer
questions about his personal life and willing to work towards solutions to his
problems.  He was amenable to counselling,
including group counselling.  At the
same time he was building his relationship with his family, who supported
him.
<P>

15  	His stay in the juvenile justice system came to an end in
October 1999 when he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in
the adult
penal system following his conviction by a magistrate of a charge of assaulting
one of the staff at Kariong.  Apparently
he had an altercation with another
inmate and threw a broom at him.  The broom missed the target and hit the staff
member, causing
a nasty injury.  The incident arose out of tension between
Asian and Aboriginal inmates.  On 26 November I granted him bail pending
his
appeal to the District Court against the sentence and the effect will be, at
least for the time being, that he will be able to
continue in the juvenile
justice system.
<P>

16  	I accept the submission of counsel for the prisoner that, given
appropriate supervision, guidance and opportunity he will respond
and continue
his course of rehabilitation as he matures.  Because he was only sixteen when
he committed these offences, any sentence
imposed by this Court must
concentrate on the need for rehabilitation.
<P>

17  	Three of the prisoner's six companions have been dealt with in
the courts.  Hooker was convicted and sentenced for the murder
of the man who
died and for counts identical to those to which the prisoner has pleaded
guilty.  On the robbery counts Hooker received
an effective sentence of five
years, comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two
years.  However, Hooker
used the knife and his sentences took that important
fact into account.  The prisoner, on the other hand, was not responsible for
Hooker's use of the knife.
<P>

18  	The remaining offenders were dealt with in the Children's Court.
PS pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company and was
sentenced to one
year's probation, after five months in custody were taken into account.  SB
pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated
robbery.  On one he received
eighteen months' probation and on the other a control order comprising a
minimum term of nine months
and an additional term of three months.
<P>

19  	A report was provided for the Court by Ms Emma Collins, intern
psychologist at the Blacktown Intensive Programs Unit of the
Department of
Juvenile Justice.  Ms Collins also gave oral evidence which I found impressive.
As a result of that evidence I am left
with the overall impression that while
the prisoner continues to have serious problems of anger management and
impulsivity, he has
a substantial chance of turning around if required to live
and work in a controlled environment.
<P>

20  	Ms Collins reviewed the sentencing options, including those in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a>, Div 4 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act</a>.  In view of the seriousness of
the offences the only realistic orders that could be made in this case, other
than dealing with the
prisoner according to law, are those set forth in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
33(1)(e)</a>-(g), which provide for probation not exceeding two years, community
service work and an order of committal to the control of the
Minister for a
period not exceeding two years.
<P>

21  	Ms Collins considered the prisoner unsuitable for community
service work.  In her written report she considered a control order
unsuitable
but that, I think, was because of her knowledge that in the meantime the
prisoner had been sentenced to serve six months
in an adult gaol.  In her oral
evidence she observed that her recommendation would change if the prisoner
ceased to be in the adult
gaol.  She would then, she said, probably recommend a
control order.  A control order is the most serious of the orders that may
be
made under the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> Div 4 of the Act.
<P>

22  	Barnardos Post Release Options Project is a program funded by
the Department of Juvenile Justice which assists young people
in the final
weeks of a custodial sentence with accommodation and re-entry into the
community.  The co-ordinator and staff of the
program are aware of the prisoner
and will help him when he is ready to be released, especially in fostering
support from his family.
<P>

23  	It seems to me that I should not deal with the prisoner
according to law but that I should impose a control order and a probation
order
the effect of which will be to allow the maximum possible flexibility in
structuring programs for the prisoner's rehabilitation.
 I think that he should
be given the opportunity to enter the Barnardos program as soon as he is ready.
I accept the opinion of Ms
Collins that it is desirable for the prisoner to
attend a violent offender program and that he would benefit from drug related
counselling.
<P>

24  	KMD, for the robbery with corporal violence of Toan Van Doan I
commit you for a period of two years to the control of the Minister
administering the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987260/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987</a>.  The two-year period
will comprise a minimum term of one year and nine months which will be taken to
have commenced on the day of
your arrest, 1 April 1998 and will expire on 31
December 1999 and an additional term of three months which will commence on 1
January
2000 and expire on 31 March 2000.  For the robbery with corporal
violence of Cong Hai Nguyen I release you on probation for a period
of eighteen
months, commencing today.  It will be a condition of your probation that you
attend such violent offender and drug and
alcohol counselling and other
programs as the officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice consider
appropriate.
