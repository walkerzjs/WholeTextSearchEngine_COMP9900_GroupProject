<b><u>14401/92 - Patricia LAMOND  v  George ARTINIAN &amp; ors</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	By a Notice of Motion filed on 15 December 1998 Mr.
Phillip Lamond seeks the following relief:
<P>

	"1.	That the Order made on 4 June, 1998 dismissing the Statement of Claim and
striking out the proceedings be set aside.
<P>

	2.	That Phillip Lamond as legal personal representative of the Estate of the
Late Patricia Lamond be substituted as Plaintiff.
<P>

	3.	That these proceedings be transferred to the District Court of NSW.
<P>

	4.	That the costs of this application be costs in the cause."
<P>

2	The relevant factual background is best explained in the form of the
following chronology:
<P>

<b>15.8.90</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond sees Dr. Artinian. She complains of pain of such
a kind and so located as to cause Dr. Artinian to take a Pap smear.
<P>

<b>24.8.90</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond sees Dr. Artinian in connection with the results
of the Pap smear of 15.8.90. Dr. Artinian tells her that the Pap
smear is
"atypical". He does not diagnose cancer, but suggests a follow-up test in not
less than 5 weeks' time.
<P>

<b>8.10.90</b>  -  A repeat Pap smear is taken from Mrs. Lamond.
<P>

<b>15.10.90</b>  -  Dr. Artinian tells Mrs. Lamond that the results of the
second Pap smear are "negative".
<P>

<b>November 1991</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond has further tests done at another clinic.
They return positive results. She is told by Professor Houghton, to whom
she
has been referred, that he cannot believe that the cancerous cells found by the
latest test had not been present 15 or 16 months
previously, that is to say in
August and in October of 1990.
<P>

<b>28.8.92</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond, by her then solicitors, files a statement of
claim in which she proceeds against four defendants. Dr. Artinian is
the first
defendant. Professor Peter Russell, who was concerned with the analysis of the
Pap smears, is the second defendant. An
incorporated clinic connected, as I
understand the fact, with Dr. Artinian, is the third defendant. A corporate
clinical laboratory
connected with Professor Russell is the fourth defendant.
The cause of action, put simply, is that the first and second defendants
failed
negligently to detect, and to advise the plaintiff in connection with, a
condition of cervical cancer from which she was suffering
when they treated her
professionally in August and in October 1990; and that the third and fourth
defendants are, variously, vicariously
liable for such negligence.
<P>

<b>4.9.92</b>  -  The statement of claim is served upon the first and second
defendants.
<P>

[It is not clear when, precisely, the statement of claim was served upon the
third and fourth defendants; but I think it is reasonable
to infer that it was
at or about the same time as service upon the first and second defendants.
Nothing turns upon this particular
detail for the purposes of the present
notice of motion.]
<P>

<b>8.9.92</b>  -  The solicitors acting for the first and second defendants
request extensive further and better particulars.
<P>

<b>15.9.92  -  Mrs. Lamond dies</b>
<P>

<b>29.9.92</b>  -  Mr. Rodney Kent, the then solicitor for Mrs. Lamond,
telephones the solicitor for the first and second defendants, communicating
the
fact of Mrs. Lamond's death, and indicating that the further and better
particulars previously requested by the first and second
defendants will be
provided in due course.
<P>

<b>About October 1992</b>  -  Mr. Lamond contacts Mr. Kent consequent upon the
death of Mrs. Lamond. The affidavit evidence of Mr. Lamond, which was not
challenged
and which I accept, is to the following effect:
<P>

	"7.  Approximately one month or so after Patricia died I telephoned Rodney
Kent, the Solicitor retained by Patricia. I recall that
he said to me words to
the following effect:
<P>

		Matters like this have to be heard in the Supreme Court and there is a five
(5) year waiting list. There would be a series of
actions, on behalf of the
Estate of the Late Patricia Lamond and an action by yourself, Kara and Nicole
against the Pathology Laboratory
and the G.P.
<P>

	I understood that there would be eight different actions pursued in court.
<P>

	8.	Thereafter I spoke to Rodney Kent who acted for me in relation to a number
of matters, many times in the next five years and
I was always given to believe
that the actions had been started. I understood that the actions were chugging
along and were still
in the list of cases to be heard.
<P>

	10.	In about late 1994 Rodney Kent phoned me on a Sunday and said to me words
to the following effect:
<P>

	"The actions will be over by Christmas."
<P>

	I then heard nothing further from Rodney Kent and in about March, 1995 I
telephoned him and was told words to the following effect:
<P>

	"No, it's not going to happen, it's still on the list."
<P>

	This did not cause warning bells to ring in my mind because I understood that
there was a five (5) year waiting list."
<P>

	11.	Approximately eight (8) months ago I was informed by a friend Jan that
matters like this can be run in the District Court.
Over the next few months I
placed about four (4) calls to Rodney Kent but he did not return my call."
<P>

	12.	I then received a telephone call from an associate of Rodney Kent who said
to me words to the following effect:
<P>

	"Rodney, a Barrister and another Solicitor would like to meet with you to
discuss the claims."
<P>

	17.	At no time was I aware that there was a failure to prosecute the
proceedings which had been commenced by Patricia in her own
right. I understood
that my Solicitor, Rodney Kent, had matters in hand and would undertake all
steps which needed to be taken. I
was not aware that the delay which I
experienced in those claims coming to court was untoward. I believe it was the
usual delay inherent
in such matters."
<P>

<b>3.2.93</b>  -  Two letters are written by the solicitor for the first and
second defendants to Mr. Kent as Mrs. Lamond's solicitor. One of these
letters
notes that further and better particulars have not been supplied and presses
for their supply. <b>There is no further correspondence between Mr. Kent, on
behalf of Mrs. Lamond, and the solicitor for the first and second defendants,
between this date in 1993 and 1998.</b>
<P>

<b>24.4.98</b>  -  <b>A notice issues from the Principal Registrar of this
Court.</b>
<P>

[There is particular evidence of such a notice addressed to the solicitors for
the first and second defendants. I think it is reasonable
to infer, and I do
infer accordingly, that an identical notice was sent to the solicitor then
acting for Mrs. Lamond; and to the
solicitors on record for the third and
fourth defendants.]
<P>

<b>The notice, formal parts omitted, is in the following terms:</b>
<P>

	"The above proceedings will be listed for call-over on Thursday 4 June 1998
before The Honourable Justice Wood, CJ at CL.
<P>

	At the call-over, consideration will be given to:-
<P>

	(a) Whether the proceedings would more appropriately be heard in the District
Court;
<P>

	(b) Removal of the proceedings from the list of active matters;
<P>

	(c) Dismissal of the proceedings; or
<P>

	(d) The making of a direction that DCM apply to these proceedings."
<P>

<b>4.6.98</b>  <b>-  Call-over before Wood CJ at CL. The following orders are
made:</b>
<P>

	"1.  That these proceedings be struck out.
<P>

	 2.  That the parties have leave to restore on 14 days' notice."
<P>

All defendants are represented. There is no appearance by or for the plaintiff
in the principal proceedings.
<P>

<b>18.6.98  -  The orders of 4 June 1998 are formally entered.</b>
<P>

<b>15.6.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond sees in conference counsel instructed by Mr.
Kent's firm. Mr. Kent himself is not in attendance. A different particular
solicitor instructs on the conference. Mr. Lamond confirms instructions that he
wishes to proceed with his late wife's claim and
with associated claims on his
own behalf and on behalf of his two daughters.
<P>

<b>16.6.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond instructs a new, (and his present), solicitor.
<P>

<b>21.8.98</b>  -  The plaintiff's new solicitor receives from the former
solicitor the relevant file in respect of the principal proceedings.
<P>

<b>11.9.98</b>  -  A conference is held with Mr. Lamond and his further
instructions are taken.
<P>

<b>9.10.98</b>  -  The solicitor newly instructed by Mr. Lamond seeks to file a
formal Notice of Appearance. This leads to:
<P>

<b>12.10.98</b>  -  It is first brought to the attention of the new solicitor
that orders, in the terms noted previously herein, had been made on
4 June
1998.
<P>

<b>13.10.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond learns of the orders of 4 June 1998.
<P>

<b>13.10.98  </b>-  The new solicitor puts in train steps to obtain affidavit
evidence to ground an application to restore the principal proceedings
to the
list in accordance with the leave in that behalf granted by the orders of Wood
CJ at CL.
<P>

<b>4.11.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond swears his affidavit in support of the present
Notice of Motion.
<P>

<b>14.12.98</b>  -  The present Notice of Motion is signed by Mr. Lamond's
solicitor, and:
<P>

<b>15.12.98</b>  -  The present Notice of Motion and supporting affidavit of
Mrs. Lamond are filed.
<P>

3	Given the foregoing sequence of events, I think that the following
conclusions are fairly available:
<P>

4	1.	It is completely clear that the progress of the principal proceedings
which were commenced by Mrs. Lamond has been marked by
what the relevant
authorities describe as inordinate delay. 
<P>

	2.	That inordinate delay is wholly unexplained except to the extent that it
was clearly attributable to a manifest failure on the
part of the solicitor
originally retained by Mr. and Mrs. Lamond, to pursue with proper professional
diligence and efficiency the
prosecution of the principal proceedings. 
<P>

	3.	If the evidence of the Mr. Lamond in support of the present application be
accepted, - and, as earlier indicated, I do accept
it, - then it has not been
shown that either Mr. Lamond or his late wife was in any way responsible for
the inordinate delay to which
I have referred.
<P>

	4.	It must be a matter of obvious concern on the present occasion that Mr.
Lamond did not appear at, and was not represented at,
the call-up before Wood
CJ at CL. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Mr. Lamond himself had
any idea that such a call-up
had issued from the Court; or that it entailed, at
the very least, a real risk that the principal proceedings might be struck out
of the active list.
<P>

5	The evidence at present available does not enable this Court to make a
finding as to what exactly it was that caused Mr. Lamond's
former solicitor to
do either little or nothing in the proper and diligent prosecution of his
client's case. The Court has not heard
from Mr. Kent, the previous solicitor.
The Court has not seen any material derived from Mr. Kent's files or other
relevant records.
It might very well prove to be the case that a proper
examination of Mr. Kent's conduct with respect to the prosecution of the
principal
proceedings would indicate the appropriateness of some proper
professional disciplinary proceedings being taken against him. There
might be
other forms of redress seen as appropriate upon such enquiry. All this Court
can say is that it is not in a position to
make any concluded findings about
those matters. The relevant finding which this Court can make, on the evidence
before it, is that
it has not been shown that Mr. Lamond or his late wife were
at fault in connection with the failure diligently to prosecute the principal
proceedings.
<P>

6	In connection with point 4, it is convenient to notice a particular
submission put for the defendants. The particular submission
is put succinctly
in the following extract from the written submissions put in for the first and
second defendants:
<P>

	"Based on the matters referred to in the affidavit of Phillip Lamond sworn 4
December 1998 it is strongly submitted that an alternative
course of action
against another person is available to the plaintiff; see <b>R v Birks
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 677</a>, and that this would be a more just and fair method of
disposing of the plaintiff's claim."
<P>

7	That submission, put another way, is that Mr. Lamond should be relegated to
such rights as he might have in civil proceedings
for negligence brought by him
against Mr. Kent, the former solicitor for Mr. Lamond and his late wife.
<P>

8	The reference made by this submission to the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <b>Birks</b> is, in my respectful opinion, misconceived. <b>Birks</b> had to
do, not with a civil action, but with a criminal trial. It turned upon the
question whether there might not be, in a particular
case, incompetence of the
accused's representative at trial, so flagrant as to constitute, without more,
a miscarriage of justice
calling for appellate intervention by the Court of
Criminal Appeal. That question was answered in the affirmative; but with the
obvious
qualification that such cases cannot be defined with academic
precision, each alleged case of such flagrant incompetence having to
be looked
at on its own merits, and corrected in a proper case. 
<P>

9	There is, however, directly on point a decision of the Court of Appeal of
this Court: <b>Morrision and anor.  v  Judd</b>, unreported, 10 October 1995.
Kirby P, (Meagher and Powell JJA concurring), having surveyed the relevant
authorities, both in Australia
and in the United Kingdom, expresses as follows
the governing principle:
<P>

	"The availability of an action against a negligent legal representative is
relevant because common sense says that it is so. It
means that the litigant,
who may be wholly or mainly innocent, is not put out of court without some
chance of redress, however difficult
that chance may be to enforce. To that
extent an injustice, which might otherwise occur to the litigant, may be
capable of being
avoided. However, precisely because of the kind of
difficulties which Smith J listed in <b>Scardamaglia</b>, it is a consideration
which `cannot carry much weight'. See per Kirby P at p.11.
<P>

10	I propose to adopt that approach in connection with the present
application.
<P>

11	What has been said thus far entails that the focus of the present
application now shifts to two distinct, but related, questions.
The first
question is whether, if the principal proceedings are restored to the active
list and permitted to proceed to trial, a
trial can be held that will be just
to all the interested parties. The second question is whether, if the principal
proceedings are
so restored and permitted to proceed to trial, there will be
occasioned to the defendants, or any one or more of them, prejudice
of so
manifest, and manifestly unfair, a kind as would entail, in a real and
practical sense, injustice. 
<P>

12	The present application is, of course, an application made by Mr. Lamond;
and it is, therefore, for him to demonstrate that in
the end result it would be
just to give him the substance of the relief which he seeks in his Notice of
Motion. That does not mean,
however, that Mr. Lamond bears in a simple and
absolute sense the evidentiary burden of proof as to any and every issue that
has
to be decided in the course of coming to a reasoned conclusion upon that
ultimate question.
<P>

13	This is, I think, a matter of some practical significance in the
consideration of the present application. The evidence put forward,
both by Mr.
Lamond and by the defendants, on the related issues of unfair prejudice and
prospects of a fair trial, is fairly thin.
This makes it important, in my
opinion, to be clear that there are some issues arising in connection with the
present application
as to which it is fair to hold the defendants, rather than
Mr. Lamond, to the evidentiary burden of proof. It is, perhaps, permissible
to
approach the question of evidentiary burden of proof by an alternative path and
as  discussed by Dixon CJ in <b>Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1957/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2097%20CLR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 97 CLR
367</a> at 371-372. In the present particular case, I do not think that, in the
end, a great deal turns on how, as between those two suggested
alternative
approaches, one deals with the practical question of identifying the party or
parties upon whom the burden rests of demonstrating
unfair prejudice or
inadequate prospects of a fair trial. What does need to be established clearly,
in my opinion, is that in a case
such as the present one, the defendants cannot
simply take the view that it is, in a peremptory sense, for the plaintiff to
establish
affirmatively, and on evidence led by him, that a fair trial can be
had; and that there is no unacceptable prejudice entailed to
the defendants, or
any of them, by the restoration to the active list of the principal
proceedings.
<P>

14	Against that background, it is appropriate to turn, next, to three decisions
of the English Court of Appeal.
<P>

15	The first decision is that of <b>Hornagold v Fairclough Building and anor:
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20TLR%20316" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) TLR 316.</a> This was a case in which a District Judge had struck out an
action for want of prosecution. A Divisional Judge had dismissed an appeal
from
that primary decision. A Court of Appeal comprising Glidewell and Roch LLJJ
allowed an appeal and reinstated the particular
action. The report in the Times
Law Reports concentrates on the judgment of Roch LJ. The following passages are
relevant:
<P>

	"His Lordship said that the conclusion that he had reached, having regard to
the authorities, was that to succeed in such an application
a defendant had to
produce some evidence either that there had been a significant addition to the
substantial risk that there could
not be a fair trial caused by the
post-commencement of proceedings period or by periods of inordinate and
inexcusable delay or that
there had been a significant addition to the
prejudice to a defendant.
<P>

	By saying that he did not say that inference had no part to play in the
process of resolving the issue of "more than minimal additional
prejudice", or
that the court could not draw inferences from evidence contained in
affidavits.
<P>

	But there had to be more than the bald assertion that the delay had prejudiced
the defendants or that it had created a substantial
risk that a fair trial
would not be possible or that it had added to existing prejudice or to the
existing risk that a fair trial
would not be possible.
<P>

	There had to be some indication of the prejudice, for example that no
statement was taken at the time of the material events so
that a particular
witness who would have been called on a particular issue had no means of
refreshing his memory, or that a particular
witness who was to be called on a
particular issue was of an advanced age and no longer wished to give evidence
or had become infirm
and unavailable in the period of the further inordinate
and inexcusable delay.
<P>

	Turning to the present case, what was contained in the affidavits was
insufficient.
<P>

	As the judge had said, the defendants did not identify the particular
witnesses nor the particular respects in which their evidence
had been
impaired.
<P>

	Where his Lordship differed from the judge was that it was incumbent on
defendants always to identify a particular witness or a
particular respect in
which their evidence had been impaired or a particular reason why they said
that there was a substantial risk
that there could no longer be a fair trial of
the issues.
<P>

	Were the mere assertion of prejudice to be sufficient, then that would in
effect transfer the burden of proof on that issue to
the plaintiff, a
submission that was expressly rejected by the House of Lords in <i>Department
of Transport v Chris Smaller Ltd (</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%201197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 1197).</a>
<P>

16	The second decision is that of the Court of Appeal <b>Rowe v Glenister and
ors.</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20TLR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) TLR 463.</a> The note of the decision is very brief and is in the
following terms:
<P>

	"LORD JUSTICE WAITE said that it was not enough for the defendant to show
merely that memories must have grown fainter during the
period of post-writ
delay.
<P>

	He had to establish that in some specific respect particular witnesses had
become disabled, by reason of the lapse of time during
the period of culpable
delay, from giving evidence as cogent and complete as they would have been in a
position to give had the trial
been held without the delay."
<P>

17	The third decision is that of the Court of Appeal in <b>Slade v Adco
Ltd</b>:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20TLR%20650" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) TLR 650.</a> It is relevant to quote the following observations of
Auld LJ. His Lordship was in dissent as to the outcome of the particular
appeal;
but the passages to be quoted do not propound principles to the
contrary of anything said in the two majority judgments. 
<P>

	"The judge's reasoning raised again, and in an acute form, the question as to
how the courts should determine the existence of
a likelihood of serious
prejudice to a defendant where there was no evidence of prejudice other than
that of the delay itself. The
authorities suggested two different answers.
<P>

	The first was that the court might infer simply from the length of a delay
that it was likely to have dimmed or distorted the memories
of witnesses.
<P>

	The second was that there must be some evidence, other than that of the delay
itself, from which a court might draw that inference.
The debate also involved
a difference of judicial opinion as to whether memory faded earlier or
later.
<P>

	His Lordship agreed with the analysis of the Court of Appeal in <i>Rowe v
Glenister &amp; Sons Ltd </i>(The Times August 7 1995:   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20TLR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] TLR 463)</a> which
was essentially the same as that of Lord Justice Roch in <i>Hornagold v
Fairclough Building Ltd </i>([1993] PIQR 400) and was consistent with the
broader statement of Lord Justice Glidewell in that case of the same
principle.
<P>

	It was that there must normally be some evidence from which the likelihood of
serious prejudice to the defendant could be inferred.
It was important to cling
to that principle while the rule in <i>Birkett v James </i>([1978] AC 297)
stood, for if it was lost there was no basis, other than one of "feel", for
distinguishing between a double presumption
of impairment of memory and of
consequent serious prejudice merely because of long culpable delay, from a
reasoned inference in the
particular circumstances of a case that such serious
prejudice was likely to result from culpable delay.
<P>

	In his Lordship's judgment, the judge wrongly inferred from the length of
delay without more than the plaintiff's and Mr. Garlick's
memories were likely
to have been impaired by the plaintiff's culpable delay and that it was likely
seriously to prejudice the defendant's
defence. His Lordship could see no
evidential or other basis for such an inference.
<P>

	The mere identification of the witnesses and of the importance of the evidence
that they were to give did not, in his Lordship's
view, satisfy the test.
<P>

	Something more was required, some evidence or circumstances from which it
could be inferred that the delay had caused some specific
problem for one or
both of the witnesses, as distinct from a general impairment of memory from the
passage of time, and that it was
likely to seriously prejudice the
defendant."
<P>

18	It is also relevant for present purposes to notice the following
observations of Neill LJ:
<P>

	"LORD JUSTICE NEILL, agreeing with Lord Justice Glidewell, said that the onus
of proving prejudice or the impossibility of a fair
trial rested on the person
who asserted it.
<P>

	It was clear that in order to establish prejudice it was not enough merely to
assert that in the nature of things memories would
have dimmed with the passage
of time.
<P>

	There was less certainty, however, as to the precise nature and the degree of
particularity of the evidence which the court would
require before the onus was
discharged.
<P>

	In reaching a conclusion on that difficult point it was necessary to take into
account some other factors.
<P>

	1.	The quality of oral evidence was likely to fall away much more rapidly in
the early months and years rather than at a later
stage. On the other hand
there was great difficulty in attributing a dimming of memory to any particular
period of time.
<P>

	2.	Account must also be taken of the fact that delay might create difficulties
for a defendant when he sought to test by way of
cross-examination the
reliability of the plaintiff and his witnesses.
<P>

	His Lordship had come to the conclusion that it was unwise to try to lay down
any strict guidelines for the exercise of the judge's
discretion in the
individual case. The onus was on the person asserting prejudice or a
substantial risk to a fair trial to establish
it.
<P>

	He would have to show that the prejudice or risk had been caused by the
inordinate and inexcusable delay since the issue of the
writ. A mere assertion
was not enough.
<P>

	But, in his Lordship's view, the individual judge should be left to assess the
prejudice and the risk and the adequacy of the evidence
in the light of the
individual circumstances of the case.
<P>

	That approach was in accordance with the guidance given by the House of Lords
in <i>Roebuck v Mungovin  </i>([1994] 2 AC 224)."
<P>

19	At the hearing of the present application, no reference was made to any of
the foregoing three decisions; but, equally, no reference
was made to any
authority to the contrary of what is there propounded. It suffices to say for
present purposes that, with one particular
exception to which I shall come
presently, I am not satisfied by the whole of the evidence adduced at the
hearing of the present
application, that there has been demonstrated in the
requisite particular way, unfair prejudice and unacceptable prospects of a fair
trial.
<P>

20	The one exception of which I have spoken is derived from paragraph 11 of an
affidavit sworn by Miss Tricia Hobson, the solicitor
having the practical
carriage of the present application on behalf of the fourth defendant. That
paragraph is in the following terms:
<P>

	"11.	If this matter were to proceed to trial, it is anticipated that all
employees of the fourth defendant who were involved in
the screening of each of
the two pap smears, may need to be called as witnesses. I am instructed that
there were four or possibly
five such employees. Of these, three cannot
currently be located. They are no longer employed by the fourth defendant.
Attempts are
currently being undertaken to locate these potential witnesses by
another employee of the fourth defendant but at the time of swearing
this
affidavit, they had not been located."
<P>

21	I recognise that this paragraph at least attempts to come to grips with the
practical requirements of which I have earlier been
speaking. I do not think,
however, that it is sufficient to carry the day for the fourth defendant, let
alone for all four defendants.
It is to be kept in mind that, so far as
concerns the fourth defendant, its liability is said to arise vicariously by
reason of the
actionable negligence of the second defendant. It is, as I
understand the case to be made against the fourth defendant, essentially
by
reference to what the second defendant did or failed to do, that it is to be
decided whether or not the fourth defendant is answerable
in damages in the
present proceedings. Quite apart from that consideration, I would think it
necessary for the fourth defendant to
have given the Court, in connection with
the present application, at least some idea of what had been done to trace the
relevant
records of the fourth defendant, and with what practical results and
practical consequences.
<P>

22	I should note, also, a submission put for the defendants and to the effect
that it is relevant to the exercise of the Court's
discretion in connection
with the present notice of motion, that the defendants have been kept, and are
being kept, at risk. Reliance
is placed in that connection upon a decision of
Waddell J: <b>Southern Cross Exploration NL and ors.   v   Fire and All Risks
Insurance Co. Ltd and ors. </b>(1986) 4 NSWLR. Put shortly, the relevant
principle there established is that: ".........the fact that a defendant is
being kept at
risk is relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion to
dismiss proceedings for want of prosecution as a matter distinct from
prejudice
in the conduct of the action". The point is further examined in the decision of
the House of Lords: <b>Department of Transport and Chris Smaller (Transport)
Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20AC%201197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) AC 1197.</a> Five Lords of Appeal Ordinary concurred in the
following statements of principle appearing in the speech of Lord Griffiths at
1209
F-1210A:
<P>

	"I would, however, express a note of caution against allowing the mere fact of
the anxiety that accompanies any litigation being
regarded as of itself a
sufficient prejudice to justify striking out an action.  [Counsel] did not seek
to argue that the anxiety
occasioned by the extra 13 months in this case should
be regarded as a sufficient ground of prejudice to justify making a striking
out order. There are, however, passages in some of the judgments that suggest
that the mere sword of Damocles, hanging for an unnecessary
period, might be a
sufficient reason of itself to strike out. On this aspect I repeat the note of
caution I expressed in the Court
of Appeal in <b>Eagil Trust Co Ltd  v
Pigott-Brown</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20All%20ER%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 All ER 119</a>, 124, where I said
<P>

	"Any action is bound to cause anxiety, but it would as a general rule be an
exceptional case where that sort of anxiety alone would
found a sufficient
ground for striking out in the absence of evidence of any particular prejudice.
<b>Biss's</b> case is an example of such an exceptional case, the action
hanging over for 11-1/2 years, with professional reputations at stake."
<P>

23	I accept, of course, the principle established by the foregoing decisions. I
recognise, of course, the prima facie analogy between
the particular facts of
the present case and the particular facts, as noted by Lord Griffiths, of
<b>Biss v Lamberth Southwark and Lewisham Area Health Authority (Teaching)</b>
(1978) 1WLR 382. I do not perceive, however, any evidence on the present
application, which is so cogent with regard to this element
of personal and
professional prejudice as would, so to speak, cancel out the other
considerations of which I have spoken.
<P>

24	For the whole of the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that it would be just
to give the Mr. Lamond the substance of the relief
that he seeks in the first
three paragraphs of his Notice of Motion. In that connection I make the
following particular orders:
<P>

1.	That proceedings numbered 14401 of 1992 in the Common Law Division of this
Court be restored to the active list of that Division.
<P>

2.	That Phillip Lamond, the husband of the late Patricia Lamond, be substituted
as plaintiff in such restored proceedings.
<P>

3.	That, not later than 7 days from the date of publication of this judgment, a
copy of the order giving effect to Order 2 above
be served upon each of the
four defendants to the principal proceedings. In default of such service on any
defendant, then the principal
proceedings will stand, by virtue of SCR Pt. 8 R.
12(1)(b), dismissed as against that defendant. I direct that service by
facsimile
transmission will be sufficient compliance with this order.
<P>

4.	That the proceedings be transferred not later than 21 days after the date of
publication of the present judgment into the District
Court of New South
Wales.
<P>

25	The Notice of Motion seeks an order that the costs of the application, if
the application be successful, be costs in the cause.
All four defendants
submitted that, even were the application successful, the plaintiff should be
ordered to pay their costs of the
present application. The first, second and
third defendants seek also, in such event, their costs of the call-over before
Wood CJ
at CL.
<P>

26	As at present advised, I would think that there is a strong prima facie case
for the making of an order that Mr. Rodney Kent
personally pay the costs of all
parties to the present application, and the costs, also, of the first, second
and third defendants
in connection with the call-over before Wood CJ at CL. I
think that SCR Pt. 52A R4 (5)(e) confers the necessary power in that behalf.
I
think, however, that such an order could not properly be made without first
giving Mr. Kent a fair opportunity to be heard upon
the question. That course,
were it to be followed, would entail even further delay and expense in the
present proceedings.
<P>

27	I will, therefore, order formally that the substituted plaintiff, that is to
say Mr. Lamond, pay the costs of all four defendants
of the present Notice of
Motion. In that connection, and for the assistance of any assessment of those
costs, I note that the solicitor
appearing for the first and second defendants
made submissions upon which the third and fourth defendants were content to
rely without
addition. I note, also in that connection, that the solicitor
appearing for the third defendant did no more at the hearing of the
Notice of
Motion than, in effect, to hold a watching brief. I note, also and finally in
connection with any assessment of costs,
that the solicitor appearing for the
fourth defendant read her own affidavit and otherwise held, effectively, a
watching brief.
<P>

28	With regard to the costs of the call-over before Wood CJ at CL, I think it
just that the substituted plaintiff pay the costs
of the first, second and
third defendants of that appearance. The fourth defendant, as earlier noted,
does not seek costs in respect
of that particular hearing.
<P>

29	The formal order as to costs therefore will be:
<P>

5.	That the plaintiff pay the costs, as agreed or assessed, of all four
defendants of the present Notice of Motion; and the costs
of the first, second
and third defendants, of the call-over on 4 June 1998 before Wood CJ at CL.
