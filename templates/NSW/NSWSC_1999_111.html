<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	On 9 December 1998 I gave a judgment in which I determined that the
plaintiffs were entitled to an order that the Uninsured Liability
and Indemnity
Scheme, administered by the defendant, should meet the whole of their liability
to make weekly payments to a worker,
following their successful appeal against
an award of compensation to that worker under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act
</i>1987</a>.  Provision for such an order is made by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation
Court Act </i>1984</a>.  On 19 February 1999, I heard argument about the orders
which should be made to give effect to my decision.
<P>

2	For the plaintiffs, it was argued that I should order the Scheme to bear not
only the weekly payments specified in paragraph 1
of the award, but also the
interest provided for in paragraph 2.  That interest was ordered pursuant to
s19 (since repealed) of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a></i>.  The total amount of
weekly payments paid under paragraph 1 of the award is $135,649.66.  The amount
of interest paid pursuant to
paragraph 2 is $43,776.64.
<P>

3	Counsel for the defendant opposed any order in respect of the interest.  It
is true that the interest formed part of the compensation
awarded under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></i>: <i>Westpac Banking Corporation v Tomassian</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2032%20NSWLR%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 32 NSWLR 207</a>, per Mahoney JA at 217 and Meagher JA at 220.  However, the
critical question is whether it is embraced by the expression "weekly
payments
of compensation" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a></i>.  I am
persuaded by the submission of counsel for the defendant that it is not.
<P>

4	The terms "weekly payment" and "compensation" are not defined in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a></i>.  In the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></i>,
"compensation" is defined to include "any monetary benefit under this Act" and
"weekly payment", in relation to compensation, is
defined as "a weekly payment
of compensation under Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> in respect of a period of total or
partial incapacity for work".  Division 2 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> is headed "Weekly
compensation by way of income support".  This could suggest that the expression
in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a></i> is directed only at the weekly payments
and not to any interest which might be ordered, but it is by no means
conclusive of the issue.
 
<P>

5	As counsel for the defendant submitted, the answer lies in the scheme of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a> </i>itself.  As observed in my earlier
judgment, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(3)</a> provides that weekly payments of compensation cannot be stayed
pending an appeal.  I referred in that judgment to <i>Lovett Building Co Pty
Ltd v Burns </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%207%20NSWCCR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 7 NSWCCR 265</a>, in which Kirby P examined the background
and rationale of the section.  His Honour observed (at 274):
<P>

	At least this much is clear from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 38:</a> that Parliament intended the
worker to gain the benefit of the weekly payments ordered under an award (both
those due to the past
and those payable at present) until the obligation fixed
by the award is lawfully terminated on appeal.
<P>

6	Viewed in this way, it is clear that the prohibition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(3)</a> was not
intended to embrace an award of interest under s19 of the Act.  Accordingly, it
would have been open to the plaintiffs to
seek a stay of that part of the award
pending the appeal.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 38(4)</a> was enacted to remedy injustice which an
employer might suffer as a result of the inability of the court to stay weekly
payments.
 In the event of a successful appeal, the employer might be relieved
of the obligation to make those payments but be unable to recover
them from the
worker.
<P>

7	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> to order the
Uninsured Liability and Indemnity Scheme to bear an employer's liability to
make weekly payments does not extend to
interest.  The plaintiffs are entitled
to an order only in respect of the weekly payments, totaling $135,649.66.
<P>

8	The plaintiffs also contend that they are entitled to interest pursuant to
s94 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> </i>on any amount which I order to be paid
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a></i>.  Section 94(1) provides that
I may order interest for the period "between the date when the cause of action
arose and the date when
the judgment takes effect".  Counsel for the plaintiffs
submitted that the cause of action arose here when the Court of Appeal
delivered
its judgment against the worker, at which time the right to seek an
order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> arose.  Not so, said counsel for the defendant.  He
submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> established an exceptional statutory procedure for the
benefit of employers, which creates no entitlement unless and until an order
under the subsection were made.  Until such an order, he argued, the Scheme
administered by the defendant was not entitled, let alone
obliged, to make any
payment.
<P>

9	Again, I am persuaded by the defendant's submissions.  I think there is
considerable force in the argument that the Scheme can
make no payment to an
employer voluntarily, but must abide an order of the court under the
subsection.  However that  may be, the
power to award interest under s94 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> </i>is discretionary and I do not consider that such an
order is appropriate in this case.
<P>

10	The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of the proceedings in this court.
The only argument to the contrary put by counsel
for the defendant was that
they could, and should, have made this application in the Court of Appeal.
That is so but, as their counsel
pointed out, that would have involved the same
exercise as was undertaken before me.
<P>

11	Accordingly, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cca1984225/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation Court Act</a></i>, I
order that the Uninsured Liability and Indemnity Scheme bear the whole of the
plaintiffs' liability to make weekly payments to
the worker, in an amount of
$135,649.66.  There will be judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant
in that amount.  The defendant
is to pay the plaintiffs' costs of this
application.
