<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>5 July 1999</b>
<P>

1   	In this matter I now give the reasons for the orders
earlier made to reinstate Teasdale Roofing and Cladding Pty Limited pursuant
to
s601AH(2) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> and under s601AH(3) to validate
certain payments and the incurrence of certain liabilities which occurred
subsequent to the deregistration.
It had been deregistered for failure to lodge
annual returns, in circumstances where the Applicant, who was the company
officer responsible
gives evidence of his being in a state of acute depression.
However, its financial position would be now in prospect of insolvency,
if
reinstated, unless salvageable as now proposed.
<P>

2   	The Applicant is, I am satisfied, "a person aggrieved" by
the deregistration and thus entitled to seek reinstatement; see Needham
J in
<i>Re Prosperpine Pty Ltd</i>  (1980) CLC 34,277 at 34,279 citing the Privy
Council in <i>A-G of Gambia v N'jie </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20AC%20617" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) AC 617</a> at 634 in these terms
(subsequently applied by <i>National Trust of Australia (Vic) v Australian
Temperance &amp; General Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd  </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1976/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] VicRp 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20VR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) VR 592</a>
at 604-5):
<P>

"The words `person aggrieved' are of wide import and should not be subjected to
a restrictive interpretation. They do not include,
of course, a mere busybody
who is interfering in things which do not concern him: but they do include a
person who has a genuine
grievance because an order has been made which
prejudicially affects his interests."
<P>

3   	He is a director, a principal shareholder and importantly a
contingent creditor of the Company by virtue of a penalty notice
served on him
by the Australian Taxation Office pursuant to s222AOC of the <i>Income Tax
Assessment Act</i> in relation to the Company's unpaid tax.
<P>

4   	I should add that the penalty notice post-dated
deregistration but there is no evidence as to whether it was prompted by it.
<P>

5   	The Company is seeking to bring about a deed of company
arrangement which the Applicant hopes will see the taxation debt and
other
debts compromised. It is based upon his contributing $80,000 to be utilised by
the Administrator pursuant to a deed of company
arrangement, yielding, it is
said, some 40 cents in the dollar for creditors.
<P>

6   	Should these arrangements fail by reason of the
Administrator being unsuccessful in those endeavours, it can be expected that
the Company will be either again deregistered or liquidated. The undertakings
in paragraph 3 are intended to ensure that ASIC is
kept informed about the
progress of the administration. This is in circumstances where ASIC has not
opposed the present application
and where the Taxation Department have taken no
step to appear to-day, though informed of these proceedings.
<P>
