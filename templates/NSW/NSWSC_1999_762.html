<b><u>030103/98- MICHAEL KHOURY &amp; ORS  v  MALEK KASSIM- T/AS KASSIM
CONSTRUCTIONS &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  When I delivered judgment in this matter on 20 July 1999, I
fixed today for the purpose of hearing argument on the
question of costs.  The
argument has been an interesting one and although I would be able to express my
views in a more lucid fashion
if I were to deal with the matter by way of a
reserved judgment, there is more than one reason why the matter should be dealt
with
now in an ex tempore fashion.
<P>

2	It is first necessary to trace a little of the background of this matter.  By
these proceedings the plaintiffs, Michael Khoury,
Mary Khoury and David Khoury
sought prerogative relief against the first defendant, Malek Kassim trading as
Kassim Constructions
and the second defendant whom they named in the summons as
"<i>Consumer Claims Tribunal</i>".
<P>

3	The first defendant carries on business as a carpenter and the proceedings in
the consumer claims tribunal arose out of disputes
between him and the
plaintiffs in relation to certain work carried out at the residence in which
the plaintiffs live.
<P>

4	When Mr Kassim commenced proceedings in the tribunal he named each of the
three plaintiffs as respondents to his claim.  Mr George
Vardas was appointed
referee and the hearing was conducted over four separate days.
<P>

5	In my judgment dated 20 July 1999, I quashed the decision handed down by Mr
Vardas on 24 August 1998 on the ground that the plaintiffs
had been denied
natural justice. There were two points involved here as I found.  Firstly, that
although two of the plaintiffs, Michael
and David Khoury had objected to the
jurisdiction of the tribunal, the referee failed to rule upon the matter as he
was required
to do under s 26 of the Consumer Claims Tribunals Act 1987, to
which I shall hereinafter refer as "<i>the Act</i>".
<P>

6	The second basis was perhaps an unusual point.  Rather reluctantly, as I
held, the plaintiffs proceeded with a cross-claim before
the tribunal.  I say
"<i>reluctantly</i>" because they made it clear on a number of occasions to the
referee that they wished to proceed with their cross-claim in the Local
Court.
However, as Mr Kassim was adamant that his claim was to proceed before the
tribunal and the plaintiffs did not wish to be
disputing with Mr Kassim in two
jurisdictions, they reluctantly stayed in the tribunal so far as their
cross-claim was concerned.
<P>

7	On 20 November 1997 the referee reserved his decision. On 8 July 1998 the
registrar of the Consumer Claims Tribunals wrote to
each of the plaintiffs and
Mr Kassim stating, inter alia, that as Mr Vardas was overseas and his return
date was unknown, their matter
had been listed before another referee for
rehearing.  The registrar attached to this letter a fresh hearing notice
specifying a
hearing date of 4 August 1998.
<P>

8	The plaintiffs were unhappy about this and instructed their solicitors to
write to the registrar expressing concern about the
costs which they had
already incurred and stating that they objected to the matter proceeding to a
rehearing, that their cross-claim
exceeded the jurisdiction of the tribunal
which was $25,000 and that they intended to initiate civil proceedings in the
Local Court
at Burwood.  The letter concluded, "<i>Kindly confirm that the
hearing date of 4 August 1998 is now vacated</i>".  The registrar did not reply
to that letter from the plaintiffs' solicitors but, thereafter, forwarded a
document entitled "<i>Notice of order</i>" to the various plaintiffs stating:
"<i>At Hurstville on 24 August 1998 the following reserved decision was made:
I order that the respondents pay to the claimant the sum
of $7,500 within one
month</i>".  It is not necessary to refer to the detail of the reserved
decision except to note that there was an award in favour of Mr Kassim
(covering both the claim and cross-claim) in the sum of $7,500.
<P>

9	The plaintiffs were dismayed with this result and commenced proceedings in
this Court, by summons dated 15 October 1998, seeking
to have the decision of
Mr Vardas quashed. 
<P>

10	I held that in addition to the failure to rule upon jurisdiction being a
denial of natural justice, there was a failure to afford
natural justice to the
plaintiffs by the registrar declining or failing to respond adequately to the
solicitor's letter to which
I have referred, and, in the circumstances, the
plaintiffs were presented with an adverse decision of doubtful validity.  My
judgment
explains why I was of the view that the decision of the referee was of
doubtful validity and I need not repeat those reasons here.
<P>

11	When the matter came before me for hearing this morning, Mr McCluskey of
counsel appeared for the plaintiffs, Mr Naef appeared
for the first defendant
and Mr Singleton appeared for the second defendant, described, as I have said,
Consumer Claims Tribunal.
 
<P>

It is to be noted that, relevantly, the notice of appearance filed for the
second defendant is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"The second defendant Consumer Claims Tribunal, level 7 Stocklands House,
175 Castlereagh Street, Sydney appears and submits to the
orders of the Court
save as to costs", </i>
<P>

The address for service was given as that of Mr I.V. Knight, the State Crown
Solicitor who filed the notice of appearance.  The
notice of appearance gave
rise to an interesting debate in this Court.
<P>

12	Mr Singleton submitted that there is no legal entity, the Consumer Claims
Tribunal, capable of being sued and that in fact the
Crown Solicitor's
appearance was for Mr George Vardas who was, for the purposes of this
litigation, the Consumer Claims Tribunal.
 I might add for the sake of good
order that, strictly speaking, Mr Vardas was the building disputes tribunal but
nothing really
turns on that, and I shall continue to refer to the Consumer
Claims Tribunal.  Mr Singleton submitted that to refer to the Consumers
Claims
Tribunal instead of Mr Vardas in the appearance was simply a matter of
description and not substance.
<P>

13	Mr McCluskey submitted that I should order the second defendant to pay the
costs of all parties of the proceedings because it
was as a consequence of the
combined fault of the referee and the administration of the tribunal that the
decision of the referee
had to be quashed.  
<P>

Mr Naef made the same submissions in relation to the first defendant's
costs.
<P>

14	Mr McCluskey and Mr Naef submitted that, on the true construction of the
Act, there was an entity designated the Consumer Claims
Tribunal and it was
open to this Court to make a costs order against it.  As I have already
intimated, Mr Singleton put a contrary
submission  I should also note that Mr
Singleton also submitted that no order could be made against Mr Vardas because
of the immunity
afforded to him by the provisions of s 45 of the Act, which I
set out hereunder:
<P>

<i>"45	Protection of things done under this Act</i>
<P>

<i>Except as expressly provided by this Act, neither the registrar, a deputy
registrar, a referee, claimant, supplier nor any other person
is liable in any
legal proceeding on account of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)  any proceedings, publication or other thing:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)  taken, made or done under the authority of this Act or the regulations,
or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii) taken, made or done in good faith under the purported authority of this
Act or the regulations, or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)  any act or thing that in good faith has been omitted to be done in
respect of the administration of this Act or the regulations."</i>
<P>

15	It seems to me, having carefully listened to the submissions by the parties,
that Mr Singleton's submission is the correct one.
 It seems that the structure
of the Act is that each consumer claims tribunal is in fact an ad hoc tribunal
and that there is no
legal entity or corporation designated Consumer Claims
Tribunal which could sue in its own name or be sued in its own name or, ex
hypothesi, against which a costs order could be made.  Section 3 (Definitions)
defines "<i>referee</i>" to mean a "<i>person who is holding office under this
Act as a referee of consumer claims tribunals</i>".  Section 3 defines
"<i>tribunal</i>" to mean "<i>a consumer claims tribunal</i> <i>constituted
under this Act</i>".  Section 5 deals with the "<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of
tribunals</i>":  subsection (1) provides that "<i>A tribunal is constituted by
a referee sitting alone</i>".  Subsection (2) provides  "<i>The senior referee
may constitute a tribunal to hear and determine consumer claims anywhere in New
South Wales</i>". <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8</a> is concerned with the setting up of the office of
registrar, deputy registrars and staff of tribunals.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12</a>, on which
counsel for the plaintiffs and the solicitor for the first defendant rely,
deals with the immunity of a tribunal from judicial
review except in the
circumstances set out in subsection (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12.</a>
<P>

16	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12</a> need not be set out verbatim here but it is  to be noted that it
refers to claims being heard and determined by "<i>a tribunal</i>", and rulings
being given by "<i>a tribunal</i>" and orders being made by "<i>a
tribunal</i>".  However, I am not satisfied that the terminology of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a> is
sufficient to undermine the effect of the early provisions of the Act which are
directed, as I read them, only to establishing
ad hoc tribunals, and the
persons appointed to administer the work of the tribunals are appointed to
assist and administer each ad
hoc tribunal as it comes into existence.  And of
course there is no provision in the Act setting up a separate legal entity
which
is stated to be capable of suing or being sued.
<P>

17	It is convenient to note at this time that I granted leave to Mr Singleton
to file in court an affidavit solely relevant, he
submitted, to the question of
costs.  Realistically, it seems to me that the material contained in such
affidavit does not have any
significant bearing on the question whether a costs
order should be made against the second defendant or whether it is open to the
Court to make one in law or not.  Although I must add, parenthetically, that
the affidavit contains documentation of the tribunal
which was not tendered
before me at the hearing, which might be thought to provide additional support
for the view which I expressed
in my judgment that the decision of Mr Vardas
was of doubtful validity,  However, that is not a matter of immediate
concern.
<P>

18	I have found s 45 to be difficult to construe.  One wonders, for example,
why it includes (if its ambit is as wide as suggested
by Mr Singleton) a
"<i>claimant</i>" and a "<i>supplier</i>"".  I have some doubt whether the
referee's omission to rule upon jurisdiction would necessarily fall within the
strict words of
the section.  One must bear in mind that because of its
purported exculpation of certain persons from liability (subject to the
exercise
of good faith) it must be construed strictly.  However, the
construction of s 45 has not been fully debated before me.
<P>

19	Mr Singleton submitted that if I were not satisfied that Mr Vardas (whom he
submits is the only person against whom any costs
orders could be made) is
entitled to the statutory protection afforded by s 45 then, nevertheless, it
would be inappropriate to make
a costs order against him under the general law.
 Mr Singleton drew my attention to the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Hope,
Samuels
and Clarke JJA) in <b>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v
Consumer Claims Tribunal</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Ors (</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988) 14 NSWLR 473</a> which
is authority for the proposition that a consumer claims tribunal is a court
exercising judicial power with regard to disputes
before it.
<P>

20	In the light of that authority, and other submissions, Mr Singleton has
persuaded me that the same common law principles which
apply to magistrates are
applicable to referees exercising jurisdiction as a consumer claims tribunal,
insofar as the question of
whether they are amenable to orders for costs or
not.
<P>

21	The position of magistrates is conveniently set out in the judgment of the
Full Court in ex parte <b>Blume</b>, re <b>Osborn</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%20S%20R%20%28NSW%29%20334" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) S. R. (NSW) 334</a> at
339, where the Court said:
<P>

<i>"If misconduct is charged against a magistrate he is entitled to appear but
even where prohibition is ordered an order for costs is
not ordinarily made
against him unless there is a clear case of serious misconduct:  Ex parte
<b>Cox</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281896%29%2012%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1896) 12 W.N. (N.S.W.) 172.</a>  The rule has been stated that the
magistrate must have been perverse or guilty of corruption or gross ignorance:
Re <b>Starr</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281859%29%2012%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1859) 12 W.N. (N.S.W.) 172</a> (note).  But even if he falls into
what the Court characterized as an astonishing blunder, he does not necessarily
act perversely:
Ex parte <b>Vincent</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281900%29%2016%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1900) 16 W.N. (N.S.W.) 215."</a></i>
<P>

22	There are of course powerful policy considerations which would persuade one
that such principles should be applied to referees
exercising the jurisdiction
of consumer claims tribunals.  They are conducting difficult and important
judicial work and as a matter
of principle they should be immune from orders
for costs unless they have failed to comply with their obligations to the
extent explained
in ex parte Blume.  The omission by the referee in the instant
case to rule upon jurisdiction, as he was required to do under the
Act, could
not, upon the evidence so far as is available to me and upon which I based my
judgment, justify a finding that he acted
perversely or as a consequence of
gross ignorance or that he committed an astonishing blunder.
<P>

23	Thus having given the matter consideration in light of competing the
submissions that have been put to me, I reject the application
on behalf of the
plaintiffs and the first defendant for orders against Mr Vardas who is, I am
satisfied, the person (and I use that
word in its strict legal term) in respect
of whom the Crown Solicitor filed the notice of appearance.  There was a
procedural and
administrative irregularity in the circumstances leading up to
the delivery of what I have referred to as Mr Vardas's decision and
order of
doubtful validity.  The registrar must, if I may say so, without meaning any
disrespect or criticism, accept responsibility
for that aspect of the
plaintiff's case in this Court.  However, no proceedings have been brought
against the registrar and indeed,
on the face of it, one would consider in any
event that the registrar would be entitled to the immunity provided by s 45
despite
the difficulties of construction involved in that section.
<P>

24	As I said during the course of the original hearing of this matter, it is
most unfortunate that bearing in mind the relatively
small amount of money in
dispute, so far as the jurisdiction of this Court is concerned, that the matter
has reached this Court.
 Further that having reached this Court the parties
were still unable during the course of the hearing to reach some compromise of
their dispute.  Now the position is exacerbated by the fact that an order for
costs has to be made.
<P>

25	In light of the views which I have expressed in relation to the second
defendant's position, the only alternative is to order
that the first defendant
pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.  That would involve the normal
principle that costs follow
the event.  Reasonably, Mr Singleton has indicated
to the Court that the Crown Solicitor does not seek an order for costs of the
day; that has made the burden on the parties easier.  I think in all the
circumstances however, that I should order that each party
pay their own costs
of today.  That does impose some burden upon the plaintiffs but nevertheless
they have been unsuccessful in persuading
me that the second defendant should
pay their costs and they have had the benefit of that argument.
<P>

26	In summary therefore, so far as the proceedings generally are concerned, I
order the first defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs.
 So far as the costs of
to-day are concerned I order each parties to pay their own costs.
<P>

27	The costs orders which I have just made are of course subject to the order
for costs made by Dunford J on 8 December 1998 that
the plaintiffs pay the
first defendant's costs of that day.  I respectfully confirm the order which
Dunford J made on that occasion.
