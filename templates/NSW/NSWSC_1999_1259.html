MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 17 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>21148/1996</u>	<u>JOHN PATRICK SENDY v THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This is yet another of the many proceedings arising out of the
collision between the HMAS Melbourne and the HMAS Voyager on
10 February 1964.
The Statement of Claim was filed on 14 October 1996.  A Notice of Motion was
filed on the same day.  It sought
an extension of the relevant limitation
period.
<P>

2  	The Notice of Motion was heard on 16 December 1999.  There is
affidavit material from the plaintiff.  There is exhibited material
(from both
the plaintiff and the defendant).  The plaintiff has been cross-examined.
<P>

3  	The defendant sought to read an affidavit sworn by Mr Ktenas (a
solicitor for the defendant).  The affidavit was said to have
relevance to
matters of prejudice.  It related to inquiries made after the court had on 22
October 1999 allocated a special fixture
for the hearing on 16 December 1999.
The special fixture had been allocated after the legal representatives for the
parties had signed
the usual special fixture form.  The form states in bold
letters that the fixture is allocated on the assurance of the parties that
all
affidavits to be read have been filed and served.  It also contains the
notation that "Only affidavits on file when the matter
is specially fixed may
be read".  The defendant had been a party to many similar hearings and was
fully appraised of the practice
of the court in relation to special fixtures.
The material related to inquiries made after the date of allocation of the
special
fixture (during December 1999).  No satisfactory explanation was
offered for the failure to prepare this material prior to the obtaining
of the
special fixture.
<P>

4  	The plaintiff objected to the reading of the affidavit.  The
tender of the affidavit was rejected.
<P>

5  	Apart from the flagrant disregard of the assurance given to the
court and the practice adopted by the court in relation to special
fixtures,
the affidavit contained material which may have required investigation and
consideration by the plaintiff and perhaps the
adducing of further evidence to
meet the material.
<P>

6  	Following the rejection of the tender, the defendant then
unsuccessfully sought to re-agitate an application for adjournment.
 The
parties had been directed on 15 December 1999 that in the event of an
application for adjournment of this hearing, the application
was to be made on
that day and before the Registrar handling the list of special fixtures for
Masters.  Subsequently an application
was made to him on that day and
refused.
<P>

7  	The special fixture document also contains the notation that "It
can be assumed that no adjournment will be granted".  Any question
of
adjournment should have been raised at a much earlier time so as to avoid
prejudice and inconvenience to the plaintiff and the
disruption of the court's
business.  The plaintiff had come from South Australia for the purposes of the
hearing.  The defendant
had required him to attend for purposes of
cross-examination.  There is evidence that travel and the visiting of major
centres is
a problem for him.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff was born on 23 January 1943.  He enlisted in the
Royal Australian Navy on 9 April 1962.  At the time of the collision,
he was a
member of the crew of HMAS Melbourne.
<P>

9  	The affidavit material details his experiences in relation to the
collision and his subsequent service in the Navy.  He had
Vietnam service in
1966 and 1967.  He was discharged from the Navy on 8 April 1971.  It also
provides a history since discharge.
<P>

10  	Since the collision, he has had a variety of symptoms.  There
has been a history of alcohol abuse.  This may have caused a
heart disorder.
<P>

11  	In 1969, (at the suggestion of his wife), he saw a Navy
psychiatrist (Dr McGeorge) about a drinking and sleeping problem. 
The
psychiatrist prescribed Valium. He did not give any diagnosis.
<P>

12  	In about 1994, because of his problems, he decided to go and see
a general practitioner.  He was referred to a psychologist
(Mr Leonard).  Up to
that time, he did not think that he had a psychiatric illness.  A friend
suggested that he might have post traumatic
stress disorder.  He applied for a
service pension (Exhibit 1).  Mr Leonard expressed to him the opinion that he
was suffering from
post traumatic stress disorder.  Mr Leonard did not take a
full history.  He expressed the opinion that the disorder centred around
his
Vietnam service.  The Department of Veterans Affairs had him examined by a
psychiatrist (Dr Trueman).  He made a similar diagnosis.
 He did not obtain any
history concerning the collision.
<P>

13  	Subsequently, his general practitioner referred him to a
psychiatrist (Dr Riseby).  The plaintiff had a number of sessions
with him.  Dr
Riseby took a very long and detailed history (which included history concerning
the collision).  The plaintiff has
given evidence as to how he came to give
that history to Dr Riseby.  Dr Riseby prepared a report dated 5 September 1996
(Exhibit
JPS 2).  In that report, he expressed the opinion that the collision
was the original cause of the disorder.  It was not until then
that the
plaintiff was aware that his psychiatric disorder was related to both the
collision and his Vietnam service.
<P>

14  	Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u>
1969</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a> prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> unless the
court is satisfied of matters set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection
(1) thereof.  These are threshold requirements
to the making of an order.  When
the threshold requirements have been satisfied, there is a discretionary power
to grant relief.
<P>

15  	Generally speaking, it could be said that the application has
been opposed in all of its aspects.  It is said that the plaintiff
has failed
to satisfy any of the threshold requirements.  Further, it is said that he has
failed to satisfy the court that it would
be just and reasonable to make an
order.  In addition to these matters, there was a specific submission that the
plaintiff's material
failed to disclose a viable cause of action.
<P>

16  	I have had regard to all of the evidence before the court on the
hearing of this application.  In particular, I have had regard
to such
inconsistencies as may have emerged between evidence and other material.  In my
view, the defendant's submissions fail.
<P>

17  	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the relevant threshold
requirements.  Similar considerations have been addressed
in previous cases
(including <u>Darcy v The Commonwealth of Australia</u> (25 July 1997) and
<u>Burns v The Commonwealth of Australia</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/223.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 223).</a>  It suffices to
specifically mention that I am satisfied that the requirement appearing in (a)
(ii) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1) has been met.  I am satisfied that, despite his knowledge as
to symptoms, he was unaware that he had a psychiatric condition
prior to 1994
(see inter alia <u>Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56 FCR 389).</a>
It was not until later that he was aware that the condition was related to the
collision.  In these circumstances, it is not necessary
to dwell on the
submissions made in respect of (i) and (iii) thereof.  Further, I am satisfied
that this application has been made
within the 3 year period prescribed by (1)
(b).
<P>

18  	The defendant has placed emphasis on the discretionary
considerations of delay and prejudice.  It is not disputed that there
has been
delay which has occasioned prejudice.  In the relevant circumstances of this
particular case, I do not regard the delay
and prejudice as having sufficient
weight as to lead the court to a rejection of the application.  A rejection
would deny the plaintiff
the opportunity to prosecute his claim for damages.
The court is not in a position to form any view as to the potential of that
claim
but it can be said that it may be a quantum of significance.
<P>

19  	I should perhaps make further mention of one aspect of the
prejudice argument.  It may be that for some periods in the more
distant past
the plaintiff has engaged in income earning activities in relation to which
there is a lack of documentation.  The defendant
may well have difficulty
investigating any claim that relates to these periods.  However, it seems also
that the plaintiff may have
great difficulty in propounding any claim in
respect of these periods.  Whatever be the position, these periods may only
relate to
a modest component of any claim made for loss of earning capacity.
This is a claim which has not yet been formulated.
<P>

20  	There is presumptive prejudice.  However, despite the matters of
prejudice, I am of the view that a fair trial of the relevant
issues can still
take place.
<P>

21  	There is evidence from both the plaintiff and Dr Riseby which
reveals that he may have an arguable claim.  It may be that there
is material
which casts doubt on whether or not such a claim may be successful at a trial.
However, it seems to me that the issues
thrown up by that material are
questions to be determined at a trial.  I do not accept the plaintiff's
submission that the material
available on this application fails to reveal a
viable cause of action.
<P>

22  	The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the court that he has
an entitlement to relief.  In the relevant circumstances of
this case, I am
satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

23  	Accordingly, I have reached the decision that it is just and
reasonable to make the order sought and that such an order should
be made in
this case.
<P>

24  	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded
in the Statement of Claim up to and including 14 October 1996.
 I reserve the
question of costs.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
