<u>12571/88   -   David Edwin Emery bhnf Mark Emery v</u>
<P>

<u>Hunter Valley Cranes Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced in 1988.  The plaintiff claims damages for
personal injury said to arise out of a motor vehicle
accident that took place
on 9 September 1987.  The accident is alleged to have occurred on O'Riordan
Street, Alexandria (the street).
 There are now four defendants.  The fourth
defendant is the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW.
<P>

2	The fourth defendant became a party following amendments made in December
1992 (it was sued in its capacity as the responsible
authority for the street
at the time of the accident).  In August 1994, South Sydney City Council (the
cross-defendant) and the Council
of the City of Sydney (the proposed
cross-defendant) were added as the fifth and sixth defendants. On 11 October
1994, the sixth
defendant filed a Statement of Defence.  It contained, inter
alia, an admission to the effect that, at the relevant time, it had
the
responsibility for the care and control of the street.  On 11 April 1995, the
fourth defendant filed a Cross-Claim seeking contribution
and/or indemnity from
the fifth defendant.  On 6 February 1996, the fifth and sixth defendants ceased
to be parties to the original
proceedings. 
<P>

3	It appears that the Cross-Claim was brought against the fifth defendant
because the fourth defendant had taken control of the
street in 1993 from the
sixth defendant.  At an adjourned status conference held on 12 May 1998, the
fourth defendant was told that
the sixth defendant had not been constituted at
the time of the accident.  Further inquiry confirmed that the cross-defendant
was
not constituted until 5 October 1988 and that the proposed cross-defendant
had responsibility at the time of the accident.
<P>

4	A Notice of Motion was filed on 30 November 1998.  It sought leave to file a
Fifth Cross Claim joining the former sixth defendant
as a cross-defendant to a
claim seeking contribution and/or indemnity.  Further, it sought an unspecified
extension of time under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act, 1969</a></i> for the filing of the
proposed Cross Claim.
<P>

5	The application is supported by two affidavits.  One has been sworn by
Rosemary Cox.  The other has been sworn by John Kenneth
Hughes.  Rosemary Cox
is a solicitor in the employ of the solicitor for the fourth defendant.  John
Kenneth Hughes is a solicitor
in the employ of the fourth defendant itself.
The opposed application was heard on 26 March 1999.
<P>

6	At the commencement of the hearing, the fourth defendant filed an amended
Notice of Motion in Court.  The hearing then proceeded
as an application for
relief pursuant to Part 20 of the <i>Supreme Court Rules</i>.  Relief was
sought on the basis that there had been a mistake in the name of the
cross-defendant to the Cross-Claim.  The only opposition
to the application
came from the proposed cross-defendant.
<P>

7	At the conclusion of the hearing, I published my decision and delivered short
reasons.  I have been asked to give detailed reasons.
<P>

8	The Court has been referred to a number of decided cases (including <u>Bridge
Shipping Pty Limited v Grand Shipping SA &amp; Anor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20173%20CLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 173 CLR 231</a>;
<u>The "Al Tawwab"</u> (1991) 1 Lloyd's Reports 201 and <u>Lloyd Steel Co
(Aust) Pty Limited &amp; Anor v Jade Shipping SA &amp; Anor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR
212).</a>  The applicable law in this State is well settled.  Ultimately, there was
no dispute as to the power of the Court to make the order
sought.  The only
issue agitated was that of prejudice.
<P>

9	There was no dispute that the proposed cross-defendant had responsibility for
the care and control of the street at the time of
the accident.  The present
cross-defendant had not been constituted until 5 October 1988.  It had been
mistakenly sued as the Council
having responsibility for the street.
<P>

10	The fourth defendant should have been aware at least as early as October
1994 that it had mistakenly named the wrong party as
cross-defendant.  This
could have been ascertained, inter alia, from the pleadings filed in October
1994.  The error arose from lack
of proper inquiry.
<P>

11	The proposed cross-defendant has chosen not to place any evidence before the
Court.  There is no evidence of actual prejudice.
 Many allegations of a
general nature have been advanced from the bar table.  The submissions were
short on specific allegations
of prejudice.  These proceedings are of long
standing.  The proposed cross-defendant had been a party to the proceedings
during the
period between August 1994 and February 1996.  The same solicitors
have acted for both the cross-defendant and the proposed cross-defendant.
 Many
interlocutory processes (including discovery and interrogatories) have been
pursued.  Investigation has taken place.  The plaintiff
has indicated that it
will make available to the proposed cross-defendant material produced as a
result of his investigations.  The
proposed cross-defendant had the opportunity
to make its own investigations when it was a party.
<P>

12	The plaintiff's injuries arose from a collision between the vehicle driven
by him and a forklift truck.  A truck towing a trailer
upon which the forklift
was loaded was travelling in the opposite direction to that of the plaintiff's
vehicle.  It seems that the
surface of the street (such as humps) may have
caused the coupling device between the truck and the trailer to break and this
saw
the release of the forklift truck.
<P>

13	It appears that the coupling device went missing in about 1988.  The street
was and remains a main road.  It would seem that
the humps would have been the
subject of action well before the fourth defendant became a party in 1992.  The
material which the
plaintiff is prepared to make available includes
photographs.
<P>

14	I do not consider that delay on the part of the fourth defendant has caused
any actual prejudice (inter alia, in relation to
the coupling device and the
road surface). 
<P>

15	The bringing of this application has been preceded by many years of delay.
Delay of itself may be productive of prejudice.  There
is presumptive
prejudice.  It may be difficult to identify the prejudice.  In dealing with
this question, to the extent that it has
application to the circumstances of
this case, I bear in mind what was said in <u>Brisbane South Regional Health
Authority v Taylor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR 866.</a>  Whilst there may be prejudice to
the proposed cross-defendant, I do not consider that it is a matter to be given
great weight.
<P>

16	The Court has a discretionary power to grant the relief sought by the fourth
defendant.  The discretion is exercised having regard
to the relevant
circumstances of the particular case before the Court and so that justice is
best served between the parties.  The
party seeking relief bears the onus of
satisfying the Court of an entitlement to such relief.
<P>

17	In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the onus has been
discharged.
<P>

18	I make order 1 as sought in the Notice of Motion filed in Court on 26 March
1999.  I direct that any Amended Cross Claim be filed
within 14 days.
<P>

19	The fourth defendant seeks an order that the costs of the application be
costs in the cause.  The proposed cross-defendant argues
that it should have
the costs of the application.  I do not accept the submission advanced on
behalf of the fourth defendant.  It
bears the responsibility for the need for
the making of this application.  I order that the fourth defendant pay the
costs of the
application.
