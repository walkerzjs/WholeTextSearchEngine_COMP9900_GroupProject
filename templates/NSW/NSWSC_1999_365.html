<b><u>110405/98 ELIZABETH MARY DAVIES &amp; ANOR - THE ESTATE OF PHILIP GRAEME
ROSE</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   The plaintiffs, who are the executors of the will of Philip
Graeme Rose, deceased, who died on 22 February 1998
seek an order for
rectification of the will of the deceased which is dated 17 August 1994.
<P>

2	Under that will, Mr Rose appointed Mrs Davis and Mr Campbell executors and
then provided for the whole estate to go to them:
<P>

"UPON TRUST for the following purposes:
<P>

(a)	I DIRECT that my right title and interest in my property at 115 Hopetoun
Avenue Vaucluse be sold and the proceeds thereof together
with any other moneys
of which I am possessed at my decease be divided equally between ELIZABETH MARY
DAVIES and JOHN GILCHRIST CAMPBELL
provided they survive me but in the event of
either of them pre-deceasing me I DIRECT that the children of the deceased
parent shall
be entitled to the share of the deceased parent such children to
share and share alike as tenants in common".
<P>

3	The deceased at his death held a one sixth interest in the property 115
Hopetoun Avenue, Vaucluse.  He owned another property
7/85 Bronco Road
Broadmeadow and he had monies in bank accounts of about $33,000 and debentures
to the value of about $335,000. 
It is thus clear that on the will as it
presently reads the Broadmeadow property and the debentures are assets which
have not been
disposed of by will and would therefore fall to be distributed on
intestacy.
<P>

4	The evidence shows that there are no next of kin entitled on intestacy and,
therefore, the whole of the undisclosed assets would
go to the State as bona
vacantia.
<P>

5	The deceased had been friendly with Mr and Mrs Campbell and Mrs Davies for
many years. After his wife died he had spoken to them
about his intentions so
far as his will is concerned.   He had said to Mr Campbell words to the
effect:
<P>

"I have come to the conclusion to leave the estate to Betty  and yourself,
Maurice and your family.  The reason is that Betty has
been a friend and
companion for 15 years.   Maurice and yourself have been my family."
<P>

6	Shortly after that, namely, 21 August 1994 Mr Campbell said that in a
telephone conversation which took place as it always did
on a Sunday evening
the deceased said to him:
<P>

I have made my will.  It is as we discussed. I have made you and Betty the
executors of the will.
<P>

Mrs Campbell said that she spoke to the deceased on the same day and he said to
her:
<P>

I have been to see a solicitor.  I have made a will leaving half to Betty and
her family and half to you John and your family. It's
a very simple will.
<P>

	And that he had also said:
<P>

If you don't need to use it you can give it to the children.   It goes to them
on your death.
<P>

7.	Mrs Davies said that she was having dinner with the deceased at her home one
day, which she said was probably 17 August 1994,
when he said:
<P>

I have changed my will today.  I have left everything to you and John in equal
shares.  If you die before me your share goes to
your children and the same for
John.  How does that sound?
<P>

8.	Mr Ruggero said that on 17 August the deceased, whom he had known for 40
years, came to his office and asked that a will be made
for him straightaway.
He said he wanted to make a will over the Sydney property.  The significant
part of his evidence appears in
the second paragraph numbered 1 which should
really be 2 as follows:
<P>

I said to Phil, "What is your full name."  He said "Philip Graeme Rose" and I
said, "What is your address?" He said "Flat 2, 71
Tooke Street, Cooks Hill".  I
then commenced the will as shown in the copy annexed until I came down to the
name of his executors.
 I said, "Who are to be your executors?"  He replied
"Elizabeth Mary Davies and John Gilchrist Campbell".
<P>

I then continued with the will. I said to the testator, "What is the address of
the Sydney property?"  He said "115 Hopetoun  Avenue
Vaucluse". I said, "What
do you want to do with it?"  He said to me,"I want it to be sold and the
proceeds thereof together with
any other moneys of which I am possessed at my
decease (sic) to be divided equally between Elizabeth Mary Davies and John
Gilchrist
Campbell provided they survive me but in the event of either of them
pre-deceasing me I direct that the children of the deceased
parent shall be
entitled to the share of the deceased parent such children to share and share
alike as tenants in common".
<P>

There was then some further conversation during which Mr Ruggero asked the
deceased whether he wanted anything else included to
which the deceased said
"no".  The will was then typed.  Mr Ruggero read it and I understand by that to
mean that he read it to himself
and he then handed it to the testator and
said:
<P>

I want you to read this will and tell me if it is what you want.   If it is
what you want I will have it signed"
<P>

He said that the deceased read it and said, "It is just what I want".  There
were no file notes made as to these instructions.
<P>

9	The first submission of Counsel for the executors is that the words which
appear before the words "UPON TRUST for the following
purposes"  gives the
whole estate to the executors in any event.  On any basis that could not be so,
but it is perfectly clear it
is not so having regard to the evidence of Mr
Ruggero as to the time when he asked who the executors were to be.
<P>

10	The next question is whether a case has been made out for rectification
under section 29 A of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a>.
<P>

11	The rectification sought is, of course, the insertion of words in one way or
another which would encompass the whole estate within
the provisions which have
been made as to part of it.  That can be done if the Court is satisfied that
the will as expressed fails
to carry out the testator's intentions.  I have
come to the conclusion that a case for rectification has been made out.  It is
perfectly
clear that the deceased would have intended to dispose of the whole
of his estate and not intend any part of it to go on intestacy,
particularly as
he had no relatives who would take any property which was not disposed of by
will.
<P>

12	Thus, I think it is proper to reach the conclusion that when the deceased
spoke of his interest in the Vaucluse property and
any other moneys of which he
was possessed, he intended that latter description to include whatever other
property he had.
<P>

13	In ordinary circumstances had it not been for the real estate in my view
there would have been little difficulty about this but
even with the ownership
of the real estate of the Broadmeadow property at the date of death I am of the
view that the evidence of
the executors and the evidence of Mr Ruggero is
sufficient to show that the will does not embody the intentions of the
deceased.
<P>

14	I should say it is unfortunate this should be so and without making too
strong a point, if solicitors do not address the question
of the assets which
the deceased holds prior to dictating a will, then what has happened here is a
result which can easily happen
and ought not to happen.
<P>

15	I make the orders as sought in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Summons.
<P>

16	I order that the will of Philip Graeme Rose, deceased, be rectified by
inserting after the words, "115 Hopetoun Avenue Vaucluse
be sold and the
proceeds thereof together with any other" the words "property and".
<P>

17	I make the orders as sought in paragraphs 4 and 6.
<P>
