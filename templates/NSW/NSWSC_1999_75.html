<P>

<b>	Directions</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   The plaintiff is to notify the defendant by 3pm today of any
proposed amendments to his imputations. That is the
first direction.
<P>

2	Before giving the second direction I indicate the great difficulty I have in
accepting that the defendant needs twelve hours in
which to indicate its
response, or proposed response, to the proposed imputations or amended
imputations of the plaintiff.
<P>

3	The effect of my ruling in relation to the plaintiff's imputations was to
eliminate from the proceedings, to use the neutral term,
one only, and one only
in one action. That imputation was discrete in the sense of being quite
detached from the series of imputations
that preceded it in the relevant
action, and for ease of reference I will refer to it as the "<i>drug
imputation"</i>.
<P>

4	Hitherto it has been my anticipation in the context of any proposed amendment
by the plaintiff that any proposed amendment will
be limited to the area of the
"<i>drug imputation" </i>only. Whilst it is open to the plaintiff of course to
seek to amend otherwise, I would candidly say that that would come as a
surprise
to me.
<P>

5	The "<i>drug imputation" </i>with which I dealt had been on the record for
the for some time. The broad ambit of the defendant's position had been made
quite clear
for some time in relation to plaintiff's case as a whole, and
really I would have thought, to use the vernacular, that as soon as
the
proposed amendment "<i>hits the deck" </i>the defendant will know immediately
what its attitude to that amendment will be if allowed and what its defence
would be if it is
allowed.
<P>

6	Accordingly I direct the defendant to notify the plaintiff by noon tomorrow
of its response to the proposed application to amend
by the plaintiff. That
response is to incorporate its attitude to the seeking leave to amend, and an
indication, in the event of
the amendment being granted, of the defences upon
which it proposes to rely.
<P>

7	The next area relates to rulings and directions with respect to the jury. The
moving party in relation to this is the defendant,
and the indications given
this morning by Mr Wheelhouse are that the directions will cover the following
areas: first, that the jury
should give separate and consecutive consideration
to the two programs;  secondly, that the video tapes will be played once only;
thirdly, that the jury is not to receive prior to the sole playing of each
video any  indication of the plaintiff's causes of action
upon them, that is
the imputations.
<P>

8	By reason of the video tape being played once only, no portions can be
replayed. Next, no transcript is to be made available to
the jury.
<P>

9	I myself have raised the question of order of addresses and the nature and
function of an opening address by counsel for the plaintiff
in the light of the
suggestion that the jury should see the videos without having been informed of
the imputations. There may be
other considerations.
<P>

10	Complaint has been made in effect that the plaintiff has given no indication
as to what his position is in relation to this issue.
That is so, but one
presently can form the view that the plaintiff's silence is conformable with an
attitude that this trial in this
area should run as all trials hitherto have
run.
<P>

11	If the plaintiff proposes outside of any suggestions for directions by the
defendant to seek some novel directions or directions
that constitute a
departure from what I have said can be perceived to be the plaintiff's
position, namely that this will run in the
ordinary way, then no doubt the
plaintiff will inform the defendant.
<P>

12	The defendant's suggestions as to directions have been fairly well set out
during the course of this morning's proceedings but
I will not require the
defendant today to formalise them, but will require it to do so by noon
tomorrow. The formalisation can by
written communication setting out with
precision the directions the defendant will seek on this subject matter.
<P>

13	In the light of what I have just said, if the plaintiff is going to seek any
directions, he should give notice by noon in writing
to the defendant.
<P>

14	It is a matter of concern to me that this expedited hearing specially fixed
to commence in the second week of Term this year
has not yet proceeded in a
substantive way. I do not propose to be critical of either party in relation to
that, but as the trial
Judge in this Division allocated to hear this action I
am becoming increasingly concerned at the potential for disruption of that
objective being achieved.
<P>

15	As I have remarked before there are two issues only to be resolved before
the jury can be empanelled to perform its limited role
and those two issues are
those that are the subject of the directions I have just given, namely
amendment of the imputations and
rulings and directions as to jury
procedure.
<P>

16	Upon those matters being resolved it is my expectation that the jury will be
empanelled and the trial commence. I use the word
"<i>expectation</i>"
advisedly because realistically anything can happen, even upon the resolution
of those matters, that might preclude the empanelling
of the jury early next
week. 
<P>

17	There remains three other general areas. The application by the defendant,
notice of which I was given on Friday in relation
to the Reply and the
particulars of malice. In view of the directions I have just given on the more
immediate issues I propose not
to give directions today thereon, but will stand
over the question of directions on the defendant's application till
tomorrow.
<P>

18	The second matter outstanding is beyond my control. That is  the resolution
of the defendant's application to amend its defence.
That is, as I have said
often, perhaps the most critical application that has been made in this trial
and its early resolution is
most desirable, but not necessary to the
empanelling of the jury.
<P>

19	The third area relates to outstanding questions about subpoenas and Notices
to Produce issued by the defendant and served on
the plaintiff, and to
subpoenas issued to third parties.
<P>

20	Insofar as Mr Wheelhouse has made a call today in relation to a subpoena
addressed to the plaintiff and has called upon a Notice
to Produce served on
the plaintiff in relation to some photographs, I will stand over to 10am on
Wednesday that call and I will not
give any directions in relation to anything
the plaintiffs are to do in relation to those matters until 10am on
Wednesday.
<P>

21	In relation to subpoenas, directed for example to the Commissioner Of
Police, and to any claims for privilege that have to be
resolved, I will stand
those matters, and it is a pity I cannot articulate them with more precision,
to Wednesday.
<P>

22	The List Judge is sensible of the continuing requirement that another judge
resolve issues relating to privilege or issues relating
to evidence in order to
ensure my being, as-it-were, "<i>quarantined"</i> from potentially embarrassing
material insofar as I am the ultimate tribunal of fact on non jury issues. With
due notice I am confident
that another judge could be found to dispose of those
matters.
<P>

23	I can indicate quite clearly my present view that the issues affecting the
jury are to be disposed of as soon as possible in
anticipation of that tribunal
being constituted on Monday or early next week to commence the hearing.
<P>

24	Equally I say of course that nothing I have said is to be taken as
preventing, as I simply cannot prevent, any party seeking
relief elsewhere at
any time in respect of any ruling that I give, but I note that during the
course of the to-ing and fro-ing of
submissions this morning an indication was
given that it is the present position of the plaintiff that no appellate step
would be
taken by him.
<P>

25	Both of those orders and directions that I have given in relation to the
amendment of the imputations and to the jury directions
all are stood over to
noon on Tuesday.
<P>

26	There is one other matter I am going to raise, it is not a matter of
directions, it might assist me if one or either side can
produce a short note
to just clarify which subpoenas and which Notices to Produce are
outstanding.
<P>

27	The liberty to apply that hitherto has been granted will continue.
