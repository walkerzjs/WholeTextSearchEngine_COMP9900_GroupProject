<b><u>TURBOSOFT PTY. LIMITED   V.   BURGESS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	On 14 July 1999, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings
against a former employee, seeking various orders in relation to
records and
information which were alleged to be records and information of the plaintiff.
The matter was returned on 19 July 1999;
and on that day directions were given
for the filing of affidavits by the defendant in relation to the interlocutory
application,
and the matter was stood over to 22 July 1999.  On 22 July 1999,
orders were made by consent and without admissions to the effect
that until
further order, the defendant was restrained in relation to certain information
annexed to the order, and also from soliciting
clients.  On 3 August 1999, the
defendant swore an affidavit in which he said that he had not disclosed to any
person any of the
information referred to in the order; and the material in the
possession of the defendant containing that information has now been
returned
to the plaintiff.
<P>

2  	In those circumstances, the plaintiff has decided not to pursue
any further relief in the proceedings, and the interlocutory
orders are now to
be terminated and the proceedings dismissed. What I have to decide is the
appropriate order as to costs in those
circumstances.
<P>

3  	The defendant was employed by the plaintiff in January 1998, and
he resigned on 31 March 1999. It is not disputed that, on 17
March 1999, the
defendant caused to be transmitted to him by e-mail two substantial data bases
concerning customers of the plaintiff.
The defendant says that he was contacted
concerning job opportunities in March 1999, that he was offered a job, and that
he accepted
this job approximately mid-March 1999.
<P>

4  	It appears that the managing director of the plaintiff first
became aware of the transmission of the data bases to the defendant
on about 23
June 1999, when the employee of the plaintiff who had transmitted those data
bases heard from a customer of the plaintiff
about a contact made to that
customer by the defendant.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff's solicitor then on 29 June 1999 sent a letter to
the defendant, alleging that shortly before leaving the plaintiff
the defendant
deliberately took a substantial body of confidential information, the property
of the plaintiff, and that he had used
that information in the course of his
new position. The letter went on to allege that the removal of the information
was done without
the plaintiff's consent, in breach of its security
arrangements, and in breach of clauses of his service contract.  The letter
went
on to require that, before 5pm on 1 July 1999, the defendant remove the
information from any computer hard disc, return to the plaintiff
all portable
media containing the information, provide a written signed undertaking to make
no further use of the information, identify
in writing all persons who have
copies or who have had access to the information, and provide an explanation.
The letter went on
to say that, failing compliance with those requirements, the
plaintiff would commence proceedings.
<P>

6  	Solicitors acting for the defendant replied by letter of 2 July
1999, advising that the defendant collected the previous letter
on 1 July 1999
and claiming that the requested deadline was unreasonable and unfair.  The
letter stated that the defendant strenuously
denied and disputed the matters
alleged, and went on to say that at least seven days was required to properly
consult with and advise
the defendant.
<P>

7  	By letter dated 5 July 1999, the plaintiff's solicitors extended
the deadline to 5pm on 7 July 1999, and enclosed a copy of
the employment
contract.
<P>

8  	It appears that there was no response from the defendant or his
solicitors before 13 July 1999; and by letter to the defendant's
solicitors on
that day, the plaintiff's solicitors referred to the previous correspondence
and the employment contract, and referred
to the defendant's obligations
"concerning competitors of Turbosoft and confidential information obtained
while employed by Turbosoft."
 This letter went on to indicate that the
defendant was given a further opportunity to provide "proper written
undertakings concerning
confidential information of Turbosoft and those other
obligations referred to above."  The letter specified 5pm that day as the time
by which such undertakings should be provided. It indicated that, failing such
undertakings or acceptable arrangements for them,
proceedings would be
commenced for injunctive relief.
<P>

9  	The defendant's solicitors responded by a letter dated 14 July
1999, seeking further particulars, especially as to the identification
of the
confidential information and the obligations said to arise under the employment
contract. Notwithstanding that letter, the
plaintiff commenced the proceedings
on 14 July 1999 and obtained an order for short service.
<P>

10  	Mr Robinson for the plaintiff submitted that that history shows
that the plaintiff acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings,
and that the
plaintiff obtained the relief substantially sought; and that accordingly the
defendant should pay the plaintiff's costs
of the proceedings.
<P>

11  	Mr Bellamy for the defendant has provided a written outline of
submissions, which I will leave with the papers. He submitted
that it remained
very much in dispute as to whether the material in the defendant's possession
at the commencement of the proceedings
was the property of the plaintiff, or
was confidential information.  He submitted that the plaintiff must be
considered as having
failed on all other allegations made against the
defendant. 
<P>

12  	He submitted that it would be inappropriate for the Court to
determine, on the material provided on the interlocutory application
and
without cross-examination, whether the material was owned by the plaintiff or
was confidential information, and certainly inappropriate
to  determine whether
the defendant acted in breach of his obligations to the plaintiff in the
acquisition of this material.
<P>

13  	He referred me particularly to the decision of <u>Australian
Securities Commission v Austhome Investments Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20AC%20136" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 AC 136</a>, and
particularly to the propositions set out in the judgment of Hill J at 143. He
submitted that, in accordance with those propositions,
I should not determine
the outcome of a hypothetical trial of the proceedings, but rather determine on
the material before me whether
the plaintiff acted reasonably in commencing the
proceedings, and whether the defendant acted reasonably in defending them.  He
accepted,
as put by Hill J, that I could take into account the fact that
interlocutory relief had been granted. However, in circumstances where
the
interlocutory relief was granted by consent and without admissions, he
submitted that I should not take the interlocutory orders
as any kind of
concession by the defendant that the plaintiff had a case, and he referred me
to<b> </b><u>Baltic Shipping Co. v Dillon</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 1</a> at 9.
<P>

14  	Mr Bellamy further submitted that the first letter of 29 June
1999 did not identify the alleged confidential information, so
that it could
not be said to be unreasonable for the defendant to have initially disputed the
allegations and subsequently sought
particulars of them.  Furthermore, the
letter from the plaintiff's solicitors of 13 July 1999 made demands for
undertakings relating
to other matters apart from the alleged confidential
information, and it was reasonable for the defendant to have sought further
particulars. In the circumstances of the correspondence, it was unreasonable
for the plaintiff to have commenced proceedings without
first replying to the
request for particulars in the letter of 14 July 1999 and giving the defendant
a reasonable time thereafter
to respond.
<P>

15  	Finally Mr Bellamy submitted that, if I were to consider the
plaintiff was entitled to some costs, the defendant should be
given costs
relating to those issues which the plaintiff raised but then abandoned.
<P>

16  	In my opinion, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to make the
demand which it made on 29 June. The information then available
to the
plaintiff was that shortly before resigning from the plaintiff, the defendant
had obtained large data bases concerning customers
of the plaintiff, and that
the defendant had recently been in contact with one of those customers. 
<P>

17  	However, I am not satisfied that the defendant acted reasonably
in resisting that demand by the plaintiff.  The defendant had
in fact accepted
other employment about the middle of March, that is, about the time when he
obtained the data bases or possibly
a little earlier. The defendant does swear
that the obtaining of that kind of information was something that employees of
the plaintiff
did in the course of their employment, but I do not read his
affidavit as swearing that he obtained this particular information for
any
particular purpose connected with his employment by the plaintiff.
<P>

18  	I accept that it would not be appropriate for me to find as a
fact that the defendant acted in breach of his  obligations in
obtaining the
information. However I think it is appropriate that for me to say that, on the
material before me, I am not satisfied
that the defendant acted reasonably in
the circumstances in resisting the plaintiff's demand.
<P>

19  	There is some force in the submission that this particular
material was not plainly identified in the letter of 29 June 1999.
However I
think there is also force in the contention, put by Mr Robinson for the
plaintiff, that an employer having reason to suspect
that an ex employee had
some confidential information would not wish to precisely limit the
confidential information specified to
the employee and thereby signal to the
employee that other confidential information might with impunity be retained.
Furthermore,
the defendant has not put on any evidence that he was in doubt
about what was being referred to in the plaintiff's letter of 29 June
1999.
<P>

20  	Mr Bellamy did submit that the material was not confidential. I
would not make a finding that it was material of such confidentiality
that it
could be protected by a covenant from being used after employment; but in my
opinion it is reasonable to consider it as information
of sufficient
confidentiality to make it a breach of an employee's obligation to take it
during employment and retain it, for any
purpose other than the purposes of the
employment.
<P>

21  	In my opinion therefore, once the defendant's solicitors had
replied strenuously disputing the material in the letter of 29
June 1999, the
plaintiff, after giving a short period as requested in that letter, would have
been justified in commencing proceedings.
I do not think that is altered by the
wider claims made in the letter of 13 July 1999.  The plaintiff has obtained
substantially
what it sought, and it is reasonable for it to seek no further
relief.
<P>

22  	For those reasons, in my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to an
order for costs against the defendant. The remaining question
is whether it
should be the whole costs of the proceedings or something less.  I see no
reason why the plaintiff should not have
the full costs of preparing and filing
the summons, and of the interlocutory application and appearances, and of
today's argument.
 The only question in my mind is whether some of the costs of
preparation of affidavits should be disallowed. However, in all of
the
circumstances of the case, particularly circumstances where the plaintiff was
not in a position to know exactly what the defendant
had done and what the
defendant had not done, I do not think sufficient ground is shown to reduce the
costs payable to the plaintiff.
<P>

23  	For those reasons I will order that the defendant pay the
plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

24  	The orders are these.
<P>

25  	I note that material sought to be returned by the plaintiff has
been returned.
<P>

26  	I terminate the interlocutory relief.
<P>

27  	I dismiss the summons.
<P>

28  	I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the
proceedings.
