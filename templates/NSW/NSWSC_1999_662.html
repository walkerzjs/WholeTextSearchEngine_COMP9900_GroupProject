<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>This is an application by an aunt to
adopt her niece.  It was made, in the first instance, to me in private chambers
on 10 December
1998.  I was not happy with the application for a number of
reasons.  The application was made by a single woman which, although
permissible, is something that one has to look at carefully.  It was made by an
aunt in respect of  her niece, which can raise complicated
issues regarding
family relationships.  It appeared to be made with the prime object of getting
an advantage under the immigration
laws and there were certain matters
affecting the applicant which needed deeper consideration.
<P>

2   	I deferred the matter for further evidence to be placed
before me, and whilst that was happening the Court of Appeal in England
decided<b> Re B</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20TLR%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] TLR 173</a>, noted in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=73%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">73 ALJ 109</a>, which seemed to
suggest that the immigration factor was of overriding importance.  However,
that decision was reversed by the House
of Lords in<b> Re B</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] UKHL 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%202%20WLR%20714" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 2 WLR
714</a>, and, when that report became available to me on 9 April, I notified the
applicant's solicitor of the fact that the Court of Appeal
decision had been
reversed.
<P>

3   	Further material was then placed before the court, but I
considered, and I believe wisely, as things have turned out, that
it would be
more appropriate to have the matter dealt with in court, though in closed
court, so that all the implications could be
debated.
<P>

4   	The matter was thus set down for hearing before me today
and has occupied the last two hours, and I have been assisted by seeing
the
applicant in person, hearing the evidence of Mr H G Milson, the Manager of
Adoption Services of the New South Wales Department
of Community Services, and
been assisted also by the submissions of Mr Smith, the solicitor for the
Department.
<P>

5   	In retrospect hearing the matter in court was wise because
having seen the applicant some of the reservations that I had when
reading the
papers disappeared and it is quite clear that there is a close bond of
affection between the applicant and the person
whom she seeks to adopt.  It is
also now clear that none of the personal matters, nor any other fact, other
than (a) the immigration
issue; and (b) the problems with confusion of
relationships if an aunt adopts a child are a problem in the case.
<P>

6   	The applicant was born in Fiji but has lived permanently in
Australia since 1993 and had visited this country many times since
her marriage
in 1987.  She has at least two sisters "S", the mother of the child, and
"D".
<P>

7   	Shortly after the child was born on 30 August 1984 the
family group in Fiji made it clear that the applicant and "D" should
be the
primary carers.  The applicant married in 1987 and moved to Australia and "D"
virtually became the child's mother and was
referred to by the child as
"Mum".
<P>

8   	The child arrived in Australia in late 1993.  In early
1994, she complained that she had been sexually abused by  "D"'s de
facto
partner.  The child was medically examined and the Department of Community
Services was also notified and the evidence suggests
that the child's
complaints were justified.
<P>

9   	Accordingly, the child who had "D" as her primary carer and
the person to whom she looked on as Mum ceased associating with
"D" and has
been in the care of the applicant in Australia ever since.
<P>

10   	The applicant said to Ms Grey, a social worker, that she
did not initially consider herself as a mother to the child, but
her motivation
was to be able to care for her and protect her.  She saw herself more as an
aunt.  She applied to and was granted
custody of the child by the Family Court
of Australia and although the other parties to the application were the natural
father and
"S", no objection was made to the applicant having custody.
<P>

11   	The applicant applied to the Department of Immigration to
allow the child to remain permanently in Australia. This application
took a
considerable time to process, but was finally refused on 10 March 1999.  The
relevant part of the departmental file has been
tendered in evidence and,
without disclosing any confidential material, it would seem that the reason why
the application was refused
was that the child does not fit within any of the
relevant criteria.  She would have fitted within the criteria had she been an
orphan.
 She is not an orphan because her parents are still alive, but she is
in many respects like an orphan because she has left the relationship
with "S"
and her biological father, and she has also been removed, over the last five
and a half years, from her relationship with
"D".
<P>

12   	The rejection of the application appears to be on the
technical ground that she does not fit within a category, rather than
on the
ground that she is an undesirable person, or that the application is a sham.
<P>

13   	In England the practice, as seen from the Court of
Appeal's decision in<b> Re B</b> is that adoption orders can be made and then
the English equivalent of the Minister for Immigration can appeal to the Court
of Appeal.
 If the Court of Appeal considers that the application is made in
circumstances where there are no substantial welfare considerations,
but the
adoption order is only being sought to give the child an abode in Britain for
the rest of his or her life, then the court
is being asked to use adoption to
confer citizenship upon a person and the application might be refused.
<P>

14   	In New South Wales the practice is that the Department of
Immigration has its criteria, but so long as it is informed about
an adoption
application it leaves it to the Department of Community Services to make sure
that the court is fully informed about
all the facts and circumstances.  This
is because, as appears from<b> Re B</b> and the House of Lords decision, one
cannot leave out of consideration the immigration factor, but the duty of the
court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 17</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aoca1965191/" class="autolink_findacts">Adoption of Children Act 1965</a> is to see that the
welfare and interests of the child are the paramount consideration.  Even if an
adoption order is made, it is
still a matter for the Immigration Department to
decide on residency, but it seems clear, as a matter of practice, to everyone
concerned
with this case that if an adoption order was made the child's chances
of making a successful application would be greatly increased.
 One reason for
this is that she would then actually fulfil one of the Department's
criteria.
<P>

15   	Ordinarily, if an aunt has custody of a child, so that she
has complete control over the child, then it is better to leave
the child in
her natural parental relationship, so that she has both the benefit of her
natural relationship and also the care and
support of the aunt.  This avoids
the confusion that occurs with many children, according to the evidence that
this Court receives
in many of these applications, when a person that the child
thinks is her aunt is really her mother and vice versa.
<P>

16   	Again, ordinarily if the reason for the application is to
get Australian residency, and there are no questions of guardianship
or
relationships being changed, and a person intends to be adopted for immigration
purposes only, the application should be refused.
<P>

17   	However, life is never simple and one must look at each
case on its merits.
<P>

18   	In the instant case, the answer to the point that custody
is adequate is that because of the immigration laws it is not. 
The answer to
the point that the immigration rules are being circumvented by the adoption is
that on the facts of this case there
is a close emotional relationship between
the applicant and the child; a relationship that has been now existing for some
five and
a half years; the previous relationships have either broken down or
been considerably weakened by the five and a half year residence
in Australia;
the child has emotional fears of going back to Fiji if "D"'s de facto partner
is still in a relationship with "D",
as it appears he is.
<P>

19   	A complicating factor is that the applicant's mother, who
is now aged 71 and is currently in Australia, provides some care
of the child
when she comes home from school.  This bond between the child's grandmother and
the child must be precarious for a number
of reasons, first that the
grandmother's immigration status is very questionable. Secondly, at 71 she may
not be expected to provide
that support for a long period of time and, thirdly,
in any event, the child is now close to her 15th birthday and will probably
require less support from her grandmother as each month goes by.
<P>

20   	It has been put that it is more likely than not that the
grandmother will have to return to Fiji.  If the child returns to
Fiji and is
reunited with "D", the relationship between "D" and the child will take up
where it left off and the grandmother will
make sure that there is no further
sexual abuse.
<P>

21   	Although there is some material to suggest that the child
has reconciled herself to "D", I am not at all sure that the presence
of the
grandmother in Fiji would be a  sufficient protection of the child against
further problems with "D"'s de facto partner.
<P>

22   	As Mr Anderson for the applicant justifiably kept
reminding me, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child.
<P>

23   	It seems to me that in the special circumstances of this
case, despite the fact that this is an aunt adoption, and despite
the fact that
one of the purposes is to achieve an advantage under the immigration laws, that
there is a close emotional bond between
the applicant and the child; the child
has had an emotionally disturbed past; she has now settled down and it is
clear, and indeed
conceded by Mr Milson, that there is no problem with the
quality of the care that the applicant is providing and that it would be
counter-productive for the relationship to be terminated.
<P>

24   	In those circumstances I feel that I was justified in
exploring this matter thoroughly before making an order and it is a
case where
I should make the usual order for adoption.
<P>
