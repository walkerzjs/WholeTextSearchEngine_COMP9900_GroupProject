THURSDAY 8 JULY 1999
<P>

4161/95 - LLOYD WILLIAM GRAY V AUSTRALIAN CANCER FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL
RESEARCH &amp; ORS;  ESTATE OF HAROLD BOARDMAN (NO 2)
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR : On 11 May this year I gave judgment on a
number of issues arising in this case.  The first issue was whether there
was
any charity which exactly answered the description in the testator's will, "The
Cancer Research Foundation".   The answer to
that question was, no.
<P>

2   	The second question was on the basis of that answer,
whether the testator had shown a general charitable intent.  The answer
to that
question was, yes.
<P>

3   	The third matter I considered was what was the purpose of
the testator's gift.  On that I said in pars 28 to 34, that one had
to look to
the four words in the testator's will to describe the sort of body that he
wished to have his benefaction so that one
could fulfil the object of the law,
that the fund must be used as nearly as possible, or, in the old law French,
"cy-pres" with the
testator's intention.  
<P>

4   	I said that the word "The" meant that the money should all
go to the one body and that "Cancer" referred to all sorts of cancer
and that
"Research" was fairly general but "Foundation" normally connoted a body who
contributed funds to other bodies rather than
doing the work itself.  
<P>

5   	Having done those three exercises, I then turned to how the
court could apply the funds cy-pres.  The Attorney-General's counsel
submitted
that in the circumstances it would be appropriate to split the fund between the
three bodies whose claim had been brought
to the notice of the court.  Although
there were arguments between some of those bodies that they should get the
whole fund, or that
one of the other claimants should not get any of the fund,
in the end I formed the view that as near as possible to what the testator
would have intended was what the Attorney-General submitted.
<P>

6   	As $3,000,000 was involved and because of the nature of the
case, it received quite considerable publicity in the press of
11 May and I
think the day before and after.  That publicity attracted the attention of the
officers of the Children's Cancer Institute
Australia for Medical Research.
They moved to stop the order being taken out so that they could apply to vary
what the court had
done to include themselves as a beneficiary.  Today, another
body made a similar application, namely, the Skin &amp; Cancer Foundation
Australia.
<P>

7   	Today has been set aside to determine whether some recall
or adjustment of the order should be made in the light of those applications.
To start with the simple aspects, there are a few minor errors in the judgment
of 11 May 1999.  For instance, in par 4 the words
"a solicitor" are wrong and
should read "an accountant".  Paragraph 38 should read "Accordingly, in my
view, the fund should be distributed
equally between the three claimants."  In
paragraph 40 the word "deem" should read "need".  None of these make any vital
difference.

<P>

8   	The essential point is whether the scheme which was
referred to the Attorney-General under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act,
1993</a> for implementation under that Act should be altered or whether it should
be further considered.
<P>

9   	Mr Nelson of counsel appeared for the Children's Cancer
Institute  Australia for Medical Research.  That is the body's current
title:
it has had a series of names over the last twelve years.  It commenced as an
association incorporated under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act 1984</a> in 1988
and became registered under the then s 133 of the Corporations Law in 1995 so
that it became a corporation under that scheme.
  Section 601BA of the current
form of the Corporations Law is the present form of the provision.  The
Corporations Law does not
specify whether such registration continues the same
body in existence or whether it becomes a new legal personality, but I prefer
the view that it is the same body as existed before it was registered.  The
matter is, however, quite clear in respect of an association
originally
incorporated under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act 1984</a> as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(3)</a> of that
Act specifies that the registration does not change the body's identity.
<P>

10   	Mr Nelson's first point was that there had been inadequate
advertising and it was unfair to his client that the proceedings
had not been
brought to its attention so that it could have fully participated in the
hearing of May 1999.  It was implied in those
submissions that had it been
heard it would have been a beneficiary under the cy-pres scheme.
<P>

11   	A similar application was made by Mr Morrison, solicitor,
on behalf of the second applicant.  This second application was
founded more on
the proceedings having gone ahead whilst the applicant, a possible claimant was
not a party.  That is no basis for
interference because the way in which
charitable proceedings are dealt with by the Court is that for reasons of costs
and otherwise
the Attorney-General represents charities generally and,
particularly, the unnamed charities who might be benefited:  see <b>Ware v
Cumberlege</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1855/686.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1855] EngR 686</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281855%29%2020%20Beav%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1855) 20 Beav 503</a>, 511; <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1855/686.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1855] EngR 686</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=52%20ER%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">52 ER 697</a>, 700.
<P>

12   	The evidence as to advertising was that initially the
proceedings came before me in 1995 for judicial advice.  In short, the
judicial
advice I gave was that the executor should commence proceedings and that he
should make inquiries for representatives of
the next of kin and for charities,
who might be claimants, either because they claimed to have a name which
exactly fulfilled the
testator's statement or because they might be a
beneficiary under a cy-pres scheme.
<P>

13   	In 1996 the executor put an advertisement in the Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper and in the Australian Medical Association
Journal
which named the testator, mentioned the words "The Cancer Research Foundation"
and asked for claimants either under that
exact name or that might be a
claimant under a cy-pres scheme.  In addition, the executor wrote to four
organisations who had general
titles indicating that they were able to have
access to such information.  They were the Cancer Patients Assistance Society
of Double
Bay, the Cancer Information and Support Society of St Leonards, the
New South Wales Cancer Council of Woolloomooloo and the Cancer
Care Centre of
the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at Camperdown.  
<P>

14   	The last mentioned letter was referred on to the fourth
defendant.  However, no other cancer research body came forward apart
from the
first and third defendants.
<P>

15   	The evidence from Mr Nelson's client is that the
advertisements were not sighted by its officers though the evidence filed
by
the first applicant shows that they do keep a look out for that sort of
advertisement.  It would appear that the second applicant
also did not see the
advertisements although it has not directly said so.  
<P>

16   	Mr Nelson says that there must be fair and conscionable
advertising and what has happened in this case is, to use his words,
"uniquely
unfair".  The case went on in May, his client was a possible beneficiary under
a cy-pres scheme and yet the cy-pres scheme
was formulated without its input.
Mr Nelson says that there is, at least now, a data base, and there probably was
in 1995, and that
there are listed 152 charities which are involved with
cancer.  He says it would take very little effort to note the thirteen or
so
who are involved with research and just send them a letter.  He says that had
this simple search and writing of a dozen or so
letters taken place all the
unfairness would have gone away.  Those submissions are joined in by Mr
Morrison.
<P>

17   	Various questions of principle arise out of those
submissions.  As I said, the present estate consists of over $3,000,000
and
there are some funds to advertise widely for prospective claimants but that
will not always be the case with charitable funds.
 Often there are a large
number of potential claimants and very little in the bequest and the Court
would not countenance the expenditure
of all the fund on advertising or legal
fees with virtually nothing left for the charitable purpose to be carried out.
The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act</a> itself shows a legislative intention that this should
not happen.
<P>

18   	If the two applicants were claiming that one or other of
them exactly answers the description things might be different. 
However, each
of them is only claiming that they should get an equal share with the first,
third and fourth defendants of the fund
under a cy-pres scheme.  As Mr Whittle,
of counsel, for the third defendant points out, there are no bodies who are
"entitled" under
the cy-pres scheme.  The cy-pres scheme is a method of
carrying out a charitable purpose.  It may be that particular bodies are
selected
to carry out the charitable purpose, but that is really incidental.

<P>

19   	The key question is how best does one carry out a
charitable purpose which the testator has imperfectly specified.  That key
purpose was worked out in the third of my decisions that I have indicated
earlier and neither of the applicants quarrelled with that
way of looking at
things.  The essential question is not whether extra bodies who might have put
in a claim would have been ferreted
out had there been more advertisements but,
rather, whether there would be any better carrying out of the charitable
purpose if that
had been the case.  
<P>

20   	Mr Morrison quarrels with that.  He says that his client's
claim is good, even though, perhaps, no better than the other claimants
and the
real question is whether the fund should be split four or five ways rather than
three ways and it is insufficient to look
to see whether the charitable purpose
has been sufficiently carried out by the scheme as formulated at present.  I do
not really
think that that is the right way of looking at it.
<P>

21   	I do not believe that it is incumbent on the executor to
advertise extensively.  He looked to the guidance of the Court, and
did put in
advertisements which, ordinarily, one would have expected would have come to
the attention of those involved in charities
for two reasons:  first, most
major charities have fund raising sections which scan public notices.
Secondly, most cancer charities
involving research have doctors either as board
members or associates who read the Australian Medical Association Journal and
would
pass on any useful information to the charities.  It might have been
better, in hindsight, to have advertised a little more but I
certainly do not
agree with the submission that it was incumbent on the trustee to examine
relevant data bases and write letters
to a dozen or so people who might
possibly be claimants.    What the executor was after was a scheme which would
effectuate the purpose
of the will and not to benefit particular bodies.
<P>

22   	However, even if this were wrong, the real question still
remains, whether the scheme as it was settled before should be adjusted.
Perhaps, the question is, really, a little different and that is:  have either
of the applicants shown that if they had been heard
on 11 May that there was an
appreciable chance that a different scheme would have been settled?  In my
view, the answer to the second
question is, no.  Accordingly, the wider
question must also be answered, no.
<P>

23   	One of the indications on the evidence in this case was
that the fund should be split up as little as possible.  There was
a lot of
evidence on behalf of the first defendant and to a degree corroborated by the
third defendant, that cancer research is a
very expensive business and that it
is necessary for grants sometimes to be made of over $1,000,000.  Unless the
first defendant
got at least $1,000,000 it is not really able to make use of
the benefaction. Secondly, the indication in the will that it was to
go to one
body reinforced the view that the fund should not be split into too many
segments.   Thirdly, the indication was that general
charities rather than
specific charities should be benefited.
<P>

24   	The first and third defendants were in this category. I
had some doubt about the fourth defendant but, eventually, Mrs Stewart
convinced me that on the evidence that was before the Court, the fourth
defendant whose focus was melanoma was, in fact, conducting
general cancer
research.  Admittedly, the two applicants have not addressed the evidence in
the same detailed way as the other three
claimants but what is before the Court
leaves a bit of doubt as to whether they really do fall within the concept that
I had in mind
in my judgment.  
<P>

25   	The first applicant focuses on children and to a degree on
leukaemia and has indicated that although its Board has not made
up its mind as
to what it might do with any money, its first thought is that it should use it
for funding a young person's Ph D research
in the cancer field. Why a young
person has been selected I don't know.  Funding a particular thesis for a Ph D
degree does not seem
to be as broad an application of the fund as the
activities undertaken by the other three charities.  
<P>

26   	Mr Nelson says that if you do research into cancer for
children you are going to benefit the general community.  I take that
point,
but the focus is on children.
<P>

27   	So far as the second applicant is concerned, the
historical documents that have been put before the Court indicate that its
focus is on problems of the skin, including dermatological problems generally.
The history it has presented is, perhaps, a little
unfortunate because it tends
to suggest that a lot of the moneys in the years in question went on buildings
and structures.  It might
not have been a typical year but again it does not
seem to indicate the same general application of funds as the other bodies.

<P>

28   	It is a little unfortunate that these two bodies were not
here to begin with but we cannot set the clock back.  I consider
that the
scheme as originally settled does carry out the charitable purpose.  I do not
think it is a situation of just saying: well,
there are five worthy charities,
they are all reputable bodies dealing with cancer research, let us just split
it five ways, because
the evidence is that the money does need to be handed out
in large slabs for it to be really useful.
<P>

29   	Mr Singleton, the solicitor for the Attorney-General
submits that no alteration should be made to the order already pronounced.
<P>

30   	The position taken by the Attorney-General is significant
as the authorities show that any application to alter a cy-pres
scheme must be
made by or with the consent of the Attorney-General:  <b>Attorney-General v
Stewart </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%20LR%2014%20Eq%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) LR 14 Eq 17</a> and see <b>Attorney-General v Bishop of

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act 1993</a> has displaced this rule.  I would disagree.  Apart
from alleviating some technicalities, the Act really enhances the position of
the Attorney-General as protector of charities.
<P>

31   	No order has yet been taken out, but the principles in
those cases should be taken as a good guide on current applications.
<P>

32   	I might add that some argument was also addressed that the
Court should not in any event reopen the argument.  This argument
was based on
<b>Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 176 CLR 300</a>, 302 and 308 and other
high authority.  In view of my conclusions on the merits, it is not necessary
to rule on this argument.
<P>

33   	Accordingly, in my view, the original order should stand
and I should now lift the stay that I made on 26 May.  What will
now happen, as
I understand it, is that under the order that I made pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(2)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Trusts Act</a> the Attorney-General will now by order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cta1993201/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a>
formally publish the scheme in the Gazette.
<P>

[Discussion ensued between his Honour and counsel re costs]
<P>

34   	I make orders 1, 2 and 3 in the short minutes of 11 May
1999, as initialled by me and amended today.
<P>

35   	So far as costs are concerned, up to and including 11 May
I make the order on the Associate's page for 11 May as order 4.
 Order 5: Costs
after 11 May of all parties to be paid by the applicants, Children's Cancer
Institute Australia for Medical Research
and the Skin &amp; Cancer Foundation
Australia.  I grant liberty to apply should there be difficulty with assessment
of those costs.
 Order 6: The exhibits may be returned.
