<b>4546/98	NAMBUCCA INVESTMENTS PTY LTD &amp; ORS v SNOCO LIMITED &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	This is a motion in these proceedings by John Edward Star as liquidator of
the two plaintiff companies for the approval by the
Court of an agreement
settling the proceedings.  The proceedings were brought to set aside certain
loan transactions as being voidable
transactions within the meaning of Pt 5.7B
of the Corporations Law.  The amounts of the loans totalled $465,000 and the
total amount,
including interest, that could have been recovered was, at most,
in the vicinity of $700,000.  The liquidator was not in funds to
conduct the
proceedings and, obviously, there were risks in prosecuting them.  After the
statement of claim had been issued but little
else done in the proceedings a
settlement was negotiated which has been incorporated in a deed, a copy of
which is annexed to the
notice of motion.  The operation of that deed is
subject to the approval of the Court.  The deed provides for the payment of
$500,000
in settlement of the claims by an initial payment of $200,000 and six
monthly payments of $50,000 each.  The first payment has been
made but is being
held "in escrow" until the approval of the Court is given.
<P>

2	The Corporations Law, by s 477(2A), requires the approval of the Court or of
the committee of inspection or of a resolution of
the creditors to the
compromise by a liquidator of a debt of the company in excess of $20,000.  That
subsection, however, does not
apply to this compromise, because a claim for the
avoidance of preferential payments has been said not to be a debt within the
meaning
of the section: see the decision of Moynihan J in <b>Re Luxtrend Pty
Ltd (in liq)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20QdR%20861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 QdR 861</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201786" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 1786</a>, with which decision I
respectfully agree.
<P>

3	However, s 477(2B) of the Corporations Law requires the approval of the Court
or of the committee of inspection or of a resolution
of the creditors to the
entry by a liquidator into an agreement on the company's behalf if obligations
of a party to the agreement
may, according to the terms of agreement, be
discharged by performance more than three months after the agreement is entered
into.
 Whilst that subsection does not specifically refer to settlement or
compromise of proceedings, the liquidator takes the view, and
in my view
correctly, that this agreement of compromise is an agreement that falls within
that subsection.  The principles by which
approval should be given under s
477(2B) have been discussed in this Court by Young J in <b>Re G A Listing &amp;
Maintenance Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2015%20ACSR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 15 ACSR 308.</a>  The agreement in that case was
quite unlike the agreement in the present case.  His Honour emphasised that
approval should be granted
only to transactions which were designed as steps in
the winding up of the company rather than, for instance, allowing the company
to carry on business or have some ongoing existence.  His Honour said (at
311):
<P>

"If the court can see that the transaction that is to inure past three months
is really for the proper realisation of the assets
of the company or assists
its winding up, then the leave should be granted."
<P>

That decision was approved and the history of the subsection discussed in
<b>Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Limited</b> 28 September 1998,
NSWSC, Austin J, unreported.  I am of the view that the transaction of
compromise is a sensible and advantageous
one for the company, although that
view of mine is actually irrelevant to the task that I have to perform.  It is
entirely clear
to me that the transaction is really for the proper realisation
of the assets of the company and assists its winding up and, in those
circumstances, the Court's approval of the transaction ought be granted.
<P>

4	The orders of the Court will therefore be that the Court:
<P>

1	Approves the entry of John Edward Star as liquidator of the first plaintiff
and the second plaintiff into the deed of settlement
a copy of which is annexed
to John Edward Star's notice of motion dated 16 March 1999.
<P>

2	Orders that the costs of the motion be paid out of the proceeds received
under the said deed of settlement.
<P>

3	Grants to the plaintiffs leave to discontinue their claims against the fourth
to eighth defendants inclusive with no order as
to costs.
<P>

4	Reserves liberty to restore the proceedings to the list on three days'
notice.
