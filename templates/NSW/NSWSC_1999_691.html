<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Wednesday, 7 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4894/97	HORIZONS CORPORATION PTY LIMITED   -v-   RIZONS PTY LIMITED AND
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>    There are presently before the Court two
notices of motion.  The first in point of time is that which was filed by the
first defendant
Rizons Pty Ltd on 23 March 1999.  The precise relief sought in
paragraph 1 of that notice of motion was, during the course of today's
hearing,
by leave of the Court amended.
<P>

2   	By that notice of motion the first defendant now seeks
substantively an order pursuant to Part 13 rule 5 of the Supreme Court
Rules
that the claims for relief in paragraphs 1 to 8 inclusive, 11 and 12 in the
summons filed by the plaintiff Horizons Corporation
Pty Ltd be dismissed on the
grounds that they disclose no reasonable cause of action and are an abuse of
the process of the Court.
<P>

3   	The second notice of motion is that which was filed by
leave of the Court this day by the third defendant, Port Stephens Council.
That notice of motion was made returnable instanter and was heard at the same
time as was heard the notice of motion filed on behalf
of the first defendant.

<P>

4   	By its notice of motion filed this day, 7 July 1999, the
third defendant seeks substantively an order pursuant to Part 13 rule
5 of the
Supreme Court Rules that the claims for relief in paragraphs 5, 6, 11 and 12 in
the summons be dismissed on the ground that
they are an abuse of the process of
the Court.
<P>

5   	The substantive proceedings were instituted by summons
filed by the plaintiff on 26 November 1997.  That summons names four
defendants, being Rizons Pty Ltd., the Proprietors Community Association
DP270021, Port Stephens Council, and Director of the Land
Titles Office and
Registrar General.  Neither the second defendant nor the fourth defendant has
participated in the hearing before
me.  
<P>

6   	By that summons the plaintiff claims a number of items of
relief.  The first five prayers for relief seek declarations, prayer
9 also
seeks declaratory relief, and prayers 6, 7, 8 and 10 seek orders.  By prayer 11
and prayer 12 the plaintiff seeks, respectively,
damages and interest; prayer
13 seeks costs.  
<P>

7   	The present parties were all parties to proceedings in the
Land and Environment Court of New South Wales No 40191 of 1997,
in which the
present plaintiff was the applicant and the present defendants were the
respondents.  On 14 November 1997 Acting Justice
Cowdroy (as his Honour then
was), delivered his reasons for judgment.   The relief which was sought in
those proceedings was essentially
relief of the nature which is sought in the
present proceedings in the Supreme Court.   Justice Cowdroy held that the Land
and Environment
Court lacked the jurisdiction to grant the relief which was
sought by the plaintiff against the first respondent in the proceedings
before
him, Rizons Pty Ltd. (which is the first defendant in the Supreme Court
proceedings).
<P>

8   	It was, as I understand it, essentially as a result of the
decision by his Honour in the Land and Environment Court on 14 November
1997
that the present proceedings were instituted by the plaintiff in the Supreme
Court on 26 November 1997.   The substantive order
made by Justice Cowdroy in
the Land and Environment Court was that the proceedings against the first
respondent be dismissed.  Subsequently
the proceedings against the third
respondent, Port Stephens Council, were, by consent of that party,
discontinued.
<P>

9   	The substantive proceedings relate to a consent which was
granted by the third defendant, Port Stephens Council, to a development
application at Salamander Bay.  The title to the land in respect of which that
development consent was granted is title which arises
under what has been
described as the Community Titles legislation, being, in particular, the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clda1989292/" class="autolink_findacts">Community Land Development Act </i>1989</a> and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clma1989255/" class="autolink_findacts">Community Land Management
Act </i>1989</a>.  
<P>

10   	It would appear that there is a dispute between the
plaintiff on the one hand and the first defendant on the other arising
out of
an agreement for sale of the land in respect of which the consent has been
granted.  That agreement for sale has been placed
in evidence before me as
exhibit A.  It will be observed that the vendor named therein is Australia NID
Pty Limited.  It would appear
that that company is identical with the present
plaintiff, and that it has, since the date of the agreement for sale, changed
its
name to Horizons Corporation Pty Ltd. 
<P>

11   	Essentially it is the case for the plaintiff that the
implementation for the consent which has been granted by the third defendant
to
the first defendant is precluded by covenant and by agreement, such covenant
arising under the appropriate management statement
and agreement arising
expressly as a result of the agreement for sale of land.  
<P>

12   	The dispute between the parties is, so I am informed, that
the plaintiff asserts that there was an agreement between itself
and the first
defendant that on the relevant parcel of land (referred to as lot 4) there
would be constructed sixteen villa units,
whilst the terms of the consent which
was granted by the third defendant to the first defendant allowed for the
construction of nine
villa units.   The plaintiff, by the various prayers for
declaratory relief in the summons, seeks to enforce the operation of the
management statement which is incorporated in the agreement for sale between
itself and the first defendant.  
<P>

13   	The present applicants bring their respective applications
pursuant to the provisions of Part 13 of the <i>Supreme Court Rules</i>, in
particular Division 2 of that Part, relating to summary stay or dismissal.
Rule 5 provides, relevantly, in subsection (1) thereof,

<P>

Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief
in the proceedings
---
<P>

(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; 
<P>

(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or 
<P>

(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court, 
<P>

the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or in
relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.

<P>

14   	The principles in relation to the exercise of the
discretion of the Court under that rule are well known.  They are most
conveniently
referred to in the judgment of Barwick CJ in <i>General Steel
Industries Incorporated v Commissioner for Railways </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125.</a>
<P>

15   	On behalf of the first defendant it is submitted that
neither the management statement nor any purported agreement to the
effect that
the plaintiff asserts can stand in the way of the implementation of the consent
which was given by the third defendant.
  
<P>

16   	For the purposes of an application of this nature, the
Court proceeds upon the basis that the plaintiff would be able at a
final
hearing to establish any factual matter upon which it relies; that is, that the
plaintiff at a final hearing would, in the
instant case, be able to establish
that both the management statement and an express agreement between itself and
the first defendant
were to the effect that upon lot 4 there would be erected
sixteen villa units and that such agreement envisaged that the first defendant
would seek the approval of the third defendant to such a development.  
<P>

17   	But it is submitted on behalf of the first defendant that,
whether or not there was such an agreement, the effect of the consent
which has
been granted by the third defendant is to override any such agreement to the
contrary or the operation of the management
statement. 
<P>

18   	The consent was granted pursuant to the provisions of
section 34 of the Port Stephens Local Environmental Plan ("the LEP").
 That
plan has effect consequent upon the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28(2)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act </i>1979</a>.  That subsection
provides:
<P>

For the purposes of enabling development to be carried out in accordance with
an environmental planning instrument or in accordance
with a consent granted
under this Act, an environmental planning instrument may provide that to the
extent necessary to serve that
purpose, a regulatory instrument specified in
that environmental planning instrument shall not apply to any such development
or shall
apply subject to the modifications specified in that environmental
planning instrument.
<P>

19   	The phrase "regulatory instrument" is defined in
subsection (1) of that section to mean:
<P>

Any act (other than this Act), rule, regulation, by-law, ordinance,
proclamation, agreement, covenant or instrument by or under
whatever authority
made.
<P>

20   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 34(1)</a> of the Port Stephens Local Environmental
Plan is in the following terms:
<P>

For the purpose of enabling development to be carried out in accordance with
this plan as in force at the time the development is
carried out or in
accordance with the consent granted under the Act, any agreement, covenant or
instrument imposing restrictions
on the carrying out of that development on
land to which this plan applies to the extent necessary to serve that purpose
shall not
apply to the development.
<P>

21   	The foregoing provision in the LEP in wide terms and
would, upon its reading, appear to cover and to be intended to cover
a
situation such as that which is presently before the Court, where the plaintiff
attempts to assert an agreement which, on its face,
appears to be inconsistent
with the consent ultimately granted by the third defendant.
<P>

22   	The effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the Act was considered by the
Court of Appeal of New South Wales in <i>Coshott v Ludwig </i>(1997) NSW Conv.
Rep. 55-810.  Meagher JA, with whom Giles and Simos JJA agreed, said:
<P>

The self-evident purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the Act and clause 32 of LEP27 is to
nullify and remove all obstacles to the planning principles decided on by the
Council or
the Minister.  In this context <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the Act is stating, in
effect, "an environmental planning instrument may state what documents should
be disregarded", and clause
32 of LEP27 is stating that one type of document to
be disregarded is a document creating a restrictive covenant.  As to the
argument
about the words "by or under whatever authority made", I am of the
view that, although chosen without conspicuous felicity, they
mean no more than
"howsoever created".
<P>

23   	That decision of the Court of Appeal in my view clearly
has the effect that the consent granted by the third defendant can
in no way be
impeded, neither can the implementation of that consent be prevented, by any
agreement which the parties to the sale
might have concluded between themselves
or under any agreement arising out of the management statement which was
incorporated in
the written agreement for sale. 
<P>

24   	It would appear, therefore, upon the basis of the
statutory foundation giving rise to the LEP and the consent granted by the
third defendant thereunder, that the plaintiff is absolutely precluded from
obtaining the relief which it seeks in the present proceedings
to the extent
that such relief is inconsistent with that consent.
<P>

25   	The plaintiff, however, submits that the terms of the
consent and the terms of clause 34(1) of the LEP are not conclusive
in
defeating the plaintiff's claim.  The plaintiff submits that, as a result of
the enactment of the Community Lands legislation
in 1989, and in particular the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clda1989292/" class="autolink_findacts">Community Land Development Act </i>1989</a>, there has been an implied repeal of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act </i>1979</a> so far
as that section relates to community title.  In that regard the plaintiff has,
as it is entitled to, relied upon the Second
Reading Speech made by the
Minister for Natural Resources in introducing that legislation into the
Legislative Assembly on 21 November
1989.  In that Second Reading Speech the
Minister said:
<P>

Generally known as the community titles legislation, the bills will introduce a
new form of land subdivision in New South Wales
and will permit greater
innovation in subdivision design and greater flexibility in residential,
commercial and industrial development.
<P>

26   	I have been taken to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clda1989292/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clda1989292/" class="autolink_findacts">Community Land
Development Act</a> </i>which sets forth the object and application of the Act.  I
have also been taken to a number of what might be described as machinery
provisions in that Act.  For example, it has been submitted that the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/clda1989292/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 26</a> of the Act dealing with a development contract would be of no
effect whatsoever if they were to be subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</a></i>.  Indeed, it has been
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that if the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</a> </i>and of the consent granted by
the third defendant under its Local Environmental Plan are as now asserted by
the first defendant, then
the entire object of the scheme relating to community
title would be rendered nugatory.
<P>

27   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that it
is appropriate that where (as is submitted to be the situation in
the instant
case) there is some doubt as to whether or not the 1979 legislative provision,
being <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a>, has been impliedly repealed by the 1989 statute, then it is
appropriate that the matter should go to a final hearing.
<P>

28   	I gained the impression from what has been said by Counsel
that there has been no decision of any superior court concerning
the submission
that is now being made on behalf of the plaintiff in respect to such an implied
repeal of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28.</a>  The decision in <i>Coshott v Ludwig </i>proceeded upon
the basis that there was no challenge to the legislative efficacy of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a>
and that what was being considered in that case by the Court of Appeal was the
effect of that provision of the Act.  The Community
Titles legislation appears
to have been no relevance to what the Court of Appeal was deciding in that
case.
<P>

29   	I have been taken to a very considerable number of
authorities concerning the circumstances in which the Court should or should
not consider that the effect of a later piece of legislation is that an earlier
piece of legislation has been impliedly repealed.
 It is unnecessary for me,
for the purposes of the present applications, to do more than refer to the
names of some of those cases
to which I was taken.  They included <i>Budanski v
Jones </i>both at first instance  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20NSWLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 NSWLR 666</a> and in the Court of Appeal
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 677</a>; <i>Googoorewon Pty Ltd v Amatek Ltd </i>(1991) 25 NSWLR
330, a decision of the Court of Appeal; <i>Nikolovsky v Government Insurance
Office of New South Wales  </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2028%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 28 NSWLR 549</a>, also a decision of the
Court of Appeal; <i>Totalisator Agency Board v TAB Agents Association of New
South Wales </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 594</a>, a decision of the Full Bench of the
Industrial Court of New South Wales; and the decision of the High Court of
Australia in <i>Rose v Hvric </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20108%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 108 CLR 353</a>, in particular the joint
judgment of Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ at 360. 
<P>

30   	I am not persuaded that there is any collision between the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</a></i>, on the one hand, and the
<i>community titles legislation</i>, on the other.  The later legislation
created a system of title.  The earlier legislation created public rights and
duties by regulating
development throughout New South Wales upon all systems of
title.  The fact that there are certain provisions relating to machinery
in the
1989 legislation which go beyond the creation of a system of title does not
seem to me of itself to put in conflict that legislation
with the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</a></i>.
<P>

31   	I am not persuaded that it is arguable that there has by
the 1989 legislation been an implied repeal of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 28</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</a></i>, either generally or in
particular, insofar as it is applicable to community title.  That being so, I
have reached the conclusion
that the plaintiff is not entitled to have the
claims for relief grounded upon the alleged agreement or covenant brought to a
final
hearing.  Those claims for relief are, in my conclusion, defeated by the
grant of consent given by the third defendant.  
<P>

32   	Accordingly, I propose to make the orders which are sought
in the notice of motion filed by the first defendant, dismissing
the claims of
the plaintiff in paragraphs 1 to 8 inclusive, 11 and 12.  
<P>

33   	The notice of motion filed by the third defendant, Port
Stephens Council, has been brought upon the ground that the relief
claimed in
the summons against that defendant, being the prayers 5, 6, 11 and 12 in the
summons, constitutes an abuse of the process
of the Court.   The basis of that
submission is that the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales is the
appropriate, and indeed
the only, jurisdiction which can entertain the claim
for relief of the nature made by the plaintiff against the third defendant in
the summons.  
<P>

34   	The plaintiff by prayers 5 and 6 in the summons attacks
the validity of the consent given by the third defendant to the first
defendant.  Section 71 of the <i>Land and Environment Court Act </i>deprives
the Supreme Court of jurisdiction in regard to certain kinds of proceedings.
Subject to an exception not here relevant, subsections
(1) of section 71 of
that Act provides that proceedings of the kind referred to in section 20(1)(e)
may not be commenced or entertained
in the Supreme Court.  That subsection
includes, as paragraph (e) thereof, proceedings referred to in subsection (2)
of that section.
 
<P>

35   	Subsection (2) gives to the Land and Environment Court the
same civil jurisdiction as the Supreme Court would, but for section
71, have to
hear and dispose of proceedings of certain kinds; and one of those proceedings
is, in paragraph (b) of that subsection,
to review or command the exercise of a
function conferred or imposed by a planning or environmental law or a
development contract.
 
<P>

36   	It seems to me that that is precisely what the plaintiff
is, by its summons, seeking against the third defendant.  I am satisfied
that
the Supreme Court does not have that jurisdiction and that the jurisdiction is
vested exclusively in the Land and Environment
Court.  To that extent,
therefore, the claim of the plaintiff against the third defendant constitutes
an abuse of the process of
the Supreme Court and must therefore be
dismissed.
<P>

37   	There will still remain on foot, however, the claim of the
plaintiff in prayers 9 and 10 of the summons seeking a declaration
that the
community scheme has become impracticable and an order that the community
scheme be varied by the registration of an amended
community scheme.  
<P>

38   	The plaintiff also seeks damages and interest.  I have
very considerable doubt as to whether damages are available in proceedings
of
the nature of those presently before the Court.  The decision of Acting Justice
Cowdroy, as his Honour then was, in <i>Doe v Cogente </i>94 LGERA is to the
effect that damages are not so available.  That matter has not, however, been
fully argued before me, and I am
not disposed at this stage of the proceedings
to dismiss the claim for relief by way of damages or interest.  But any
entitlement
which the plaintiff might have to damages or interest would be only
as a consequence to any substantive entitlement which the plaintiff
might
otherwise be able to establish.  
<P>

39   	It follows therefore from my foregoing views that I
propose to order that the claim of the plaintiff against the first defendant
be
dismissed and the claim of the plaintiff against the third defendant be
dismissed.  There will remain only the items of relief
sought in prayers 9 and
10, which essentially are relief against the second defendant.
<P>

40   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the proceedings against the first defendant be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the proceedings against the third defendant be dismissed.
<P>

3.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the first defendant of the
notice of motion filed by the first defendant on 23 March
1999 and of the
proceedings.
<P>

4.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the third defendant of the
notice of motion filed by the third defendant on 7 July
1999 and of the
proceedings.
<P>

5.	I stand the matter over to Monday 9 August 1999 before the Registrar for
directions.
<P>

	The exhibits may be returned.
