<b>Thursday 29 April 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>21262/95  -  JOHN TINGLE &amp; ANOR  v  HARBOUR RADIO PTY LTD &amp; ANOR
[No 3]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (see p 164 of transcript)</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> In the course of evidence from the plaintiff Mr McClintock
SC, appearing for the defendant, has sought to obtain from Mr Tingle evidence
as to instructions given to his solicitor at the time a letter of 1 November
1995 was sent to the defendant, complaining about the
publication.
<P>

2	The letter opens with the statement that it is written on behalf of John
Tingle and The Shooters' Party.  It says, "We act for
John Tingle and The
Shooters' Party".  It then reproduces quotations from the broadcast about which
complaint is made.  Having done
that the following is then said:
<P>

	"We are instructed that our clients are extremely distressed and upset by the
above statements which are offensive, defamatory
and totally inaccurate.
<P>

	In particular the statements contain the following defamatory imputations
about our clients".
<P>

3	A number of imputations are then set out, to the effect that the clients,
that is to say Mr Tingle and The Shooters' Party, are
unable to pay their
debts, are in financial difficulties, are in receipt of funds from the United
States, are connected with, or
associated with, or influenced by the National
Rifle Association of America, and they are not able to make legitimate
political comment
because of their inability to pay debts.
<P>

4	Having set out these imputations, the letter continues as follows:
<P>

	"We are instructed that these imputations are false and offensive and will be
likely to be extremely damaging to our clients reputation.
<P>

	We are canvassing all of the above allegations and are instructed that they
contain the following inaccuracies".
<P>

5	The inaccuracies are then identified.  They relate in each case to the
various defamatory imputations which were set out in the
earlier part of the
letter, namely, that neither Mr Tingle nor The Shooters' Party was in debt to
the State Government, nor in receipt
of funds from the USA, nor influenced by
the National Rifle Association of America, nor in debt to the State Government
for $880,000.
<P>

6	Mr McClintock, in these circumstances, seeks to ask a number of questions
drawing attention to the failure of the letter to include
imputations, which,
in substance, are those pleaded in the statement of claim, and which
relevantly, in terms of the jury finding,
include an allegation of Mr Tingle
bragging about certain matters, and doing so with knowledge that such matters
were false.
<P>

7	The issue, therefore, arises whether the letter, which purports to reproduce
instructions from Mr Tingle, and The Shooters' Party,
permits Mr McClintock, on
behalf of his client, to explore precisely what instructions were given.
<P>

8	Can it be said that there is an express or implied waiver of the privilege
between Mr Tingle and the solicitor whom he saw?
<P>

9	It seems to me important, when one deals with the issue, to isolate those
matters which are stated, in terms, to be instructions,
and those matters which
are a commentary by the solicitor upon those instructions.
<P>

10	I believe that the matters which are stated to be instructions, and which
operate as a waiver, are these.
<P>

11	First, that Mr Tingle was materially distressed and upset by the statements
which appear in the letter.
<P>

12	Secondly, that the matters which were identified in the letter at the foot
of p1 and the top of p2 of Exhibit E, were both false
and offensive to him, and
materially damaging to his reputation.
<P>

13	Thirdly, that such matters contain the inaccuracies which are set out on
page 2, namely:
<P>

*	Neither John Tingle nor the Shooters Party is in debt to the State
Government.
<P>

*	The Shooters Party does not receive any funding from the United States.
<P>

*	The Shooters Party is not in any way influenced by the National Rifle
Association of America and has no association with the National
Rifle
Association of America.
<P>

*	Neither John Tingle nor the Shooters Party is in debt to the State Government
in the sum of $880,000 or at all.
<P>

14	I do not accept, as a matter of construction of the letter, that the word
'defamatory' where it appears in the third paragraph
on the first page, as part
of the phrase, "offensive, defamatory, and totally inaccurate" can be
attributed, by way of instructions,
to Mr Tingle.  It appears to me, as a
matter of construction, more likely to reflect the view of the solicitor, on
the instructions
he had received.
<P>

15	There having been, in this letter, an authorised partial disclosure of
communications which would otherwise have been privileged,
such matters can be
explored, consistently with s.122(4) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  They relate first,
to the distress and upset by the statements which are numbered paragraphs 1, 2,
and 3 on the first page.
<P>

16	Secondly, the offensiveness and falsity of the five matters which appear at
the foot of page 1 and the top of page 2 of the same
letter, and the
inaccuracies which are set out in the four asterisk points on page 2 beginning
with "Neither John Tingle nor The
Shooters' Party is in debt to the State
Government" and ending with the reference to 880,000.
<P>

17	I should add, Mr Blackburn, on behalf of the plaintiff, has said, in support
of his objection to the course which I have outlined,
that the letter purports
to be instructions from both Mr Tingle and The Shooters' Party, and therefore
cannot fairly be attributed
simply to Mr Tingle.  However, I believe, in the
circumstances, as a matter of construction, that the statements which I have
identified
can be so attributed.  The letter does refer to both clients  It
makes no distinction between either, and purports to speak on behalf
of
both.
<P>

18	For that reason I believe Mr McClintock can explore those issues by way of
cross-examination.
