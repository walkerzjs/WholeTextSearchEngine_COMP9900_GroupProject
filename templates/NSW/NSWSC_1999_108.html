<b>20824/97   -   MARTIN OTTO WATERHOUSE &amp; 2 Ors  v  </b>
<P>

<b>			CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STATE </b>
<P>

<b>			REVENUE &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Preliminary determination </b>
<P>

<b>  of questions of law)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The first and second defendants each seek to have different
questions of law be heard separately before the substantive hearing
of these
proceedings.  The first defendant relied on the affidavit of Paul Addison
Zikking sworn 8 January 1999 and the second defendant
relied on the affidavit
of Kevin William Davenport sworn 14 January 1999.  All the parties agree that
liability should be determined
separately and prior to damages.  
<P>

2	This case involves a dispute between the plaintiffs who were the beneficial
owners of the Hotel Charles situated at the corner
of Brown and Railway Streets
Chatswood (the land).  Until 1992 the plaintiffs made payments of land tax to
the first defendant. 
Paragraph 7 of the statement of claim alleges that in
1959 or 1960 the second defendant, Willoughby City Council entered on and took
possession of that part of the land and built a public road on it.  Since about
1960 the plaintiffs have been paying land tax payments
on the whole of the
property including part of the land that became a public road. On 16 July 1993
the plaintiffs became the registered
proprietors of the Hotel Charles.  They
sold the property on 5 November 1997.
<P>

3	The claim against the first defendant is that they were under a mistaken
belief that the amount of land tax paid in relation to
this land had been
properly levied pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/" class="autolink_findacts">Land Tax Management Act</a></b>.  Alternatively
they claim that the first defendant has been unjustly enriched in the sum of
the land tax payments and is liable
to make restitution to the plaintiffs.  
<P>

4	Similarly a claim is made against the second defendant that money was paid to
the council for rates on the land and those rates
calculated to the land value
of the whole of the land.  The plaintiff alleges that the second defendant has
been unjustly enriched
in the sum of the value of the land and the rate
payments and is liable to make restitution to the plaintiffs.  The amended
statement
of claim also alleges that from 5 August 1954 to 5 November 1997 the
second defendant committed trespass.  It also pleads causes
of action for
breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against the second defendant.  The
plaintiff also claim that the second defendant
failed to compensate them for
the acquisition of the land. 
<P>

5	The damages sought against the first defendant are payments equal to the sum
of the land tax payments, interest and costs;  as
against the second defendant
the plaintiff seeks damages for payment of the sum equal to the sum of the
rates payments and land tax
payments, restitution duties, equitable
compensation damages and interest. 
<P>

6	The first defendant seeks that the following preliminary question of law be
determined.
<P>

(1)	Whether the failure of the plaintiffs and/or the previous registered
proprietors of the land the subject of these proceedings
("the subject land")
to exercise their rights pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/" class="autolink_findacts">Land Tax Management Act</a></b> 1956,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> or the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/" class="autolink_findacts">Taxation Administration Act</a></b> 1996, precludes the plaintiffs
from obtaining relief claimed in these proceedings.
<P>

(2)	Whether the provisions of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 preclude the
plaintiffs from maintaining the claims or some of them, in the amended
statement of claim against the first defendant.
<P>

(3)	Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain the claims against the
first defendant in the amended statement of claim for
the period 1956 to 16
July 1993 by reason of the fact that land tax was paid by the then registered
proprietors of the subject land
and not the plaintiffs.
<P>

(4)	Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain the claims against the
first defendant in the amended statement of claim by
reason that at all
material times the land allegedly occupied by the second defendant ("the road")
was registered on the title in
the names of the registered proprietors who paid
land tax to the first defendant. 
<P>

7	In that regard the second defendant submitted that this question can be
determined if the following assumed facts taken from the
amended statement of
claim are agreed.  The plaintiff does not dispute these facts.
<P>

(a)	The plaintiffs became the registered proprietors of the land the subject of
these proceedings ("the subject land") on 16 July
1993 and paid to the first
defendant land tax in respect of the subject land including the road, from that
date until they sold the
land on 5 November 1997.
<P>

(b)	Prior to the plaintiffs becoming the registered proprietors of the subject
land, the register proprietors of the subject land
paid land tax to the first
defendant in respect of the subject property including the land allegedly
possessed by the second defendant
("the road").
<P>

(c)	At no time from 1956 until the present have either the plaintiffs or the
registered proprietors of the subject land prior to
16 July 1993, exercised or
asserted rights pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/" class="autolink_findacts">Land Tax Management Act</a></b> 1956, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ltma1956173/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> or
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/" class="autolink_findacts">Taxation Administration Act</a></b> 1996, in respect of land tax allegedly
payable in respect of the road.
<P>

(d)	The second defendant allegedly took possession of the road in or about 1959
or 1960 but the title was never transferred from
the registered proprietors of
the subject land to the council.
<P>

(e)	At all relevant times until 13 July 1993 the plaintiffs has a beneficial
interest in the subject land.
<P>

8	The second defendant's preliminary questions of law are:
<P>

(1)	Whether the failure by the plaintiffs to exercise rights of appeal pursuant
to s 133 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a></b> 1919 or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s574.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 574</a> <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government
Act</a></b> 1993 precludes them from obtaining relief based upon the claim in these
proceedings that part of the subject land was not and is
not rateable.
<P>

(2)	Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain the claims made in the
amended statement of claim having regard to the provision
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></b> 1969.
<P>

9	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> r 2(a) of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> provides:
<P>

	<b>"2.	The Court may make orders for -</b>
<P>

<b>	 (a)	the decision of any question separately from any 	other question,
whether before, at or after any 	trial or further trial in
the
proceedings."</b>
<P>

10	In <b><u>CBS Productions v O'Neill</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 601</a> at 606 Kirby P
referred to separate determination of liability and stated:  
<P>

	<b>"Care must also be taken in utilising the procedures now available for the
determination of preliminary points to avoid such determination
in cases which
are not ripe for this treatment.  A matter is "ripe" for separate and </b>
<P>

<b>preliminary determination where it is a central issue in contention between
the parties, the resolution of which will either obviate
the necessity of
litigation altogether or substantially narrow the field of controversy."</b>
<P>

<b>	.....</b>
<P>

<b>	"It is my view that the court should be facultative in the matter of
separate decisions on questions arising in the course of the
trial.  The rules
now provide for it.  Where the exceptional circumstances exist that make it
sensible to do so (and no reason exists
to suggest the contrary) the procedure
can be beneficial.  It can contribute not only to the prompt disposal of
crucial issues in
the litigation (sometimes resulting in disposal of the whole
action and even judgment for a party).  It can also contribute to the
saving of
time and costs where an authoritative decision narrows the issues for trial
substantially, excluding the necessity to explore
factual matters which, on one
determination of the preliminary question, are entirely unnecessary."</b>
<P>

11	Kirby P also says that the resolution of a central issue may assist the
parties involved in the litigation to reach a settlement.
<P>

12	The plaintiffs' case as pleaded spans a period of more than 40 years in
respect of overpayments of land tax and council rates.
 Those claims raise
difficult and time consuming issues of evidence including valuation evidence
for each of the years in respect
of over payments are alleged by the plaintiffs
in respect of land tax and rates.  Evidence concerning the circumstances in
1959 in
which it is alleged that the second defendant the Council of the City
of Willoughby took possession of the land will need to be given.
<P>

13	
<P>

The defendants submitted that the determination of the proposed preliminary
questions of law will result in the saving of court
time and costs of the
parties.  It was submitted that the limitation questions may take half a day to
determine.  The plaintiff opposes
the determination of preliminary issues as
they submit that a determination of the preliminary issues will involve an
inquiry into
the factual matrix of the case.  Further even if part of the claim
was found to be statute barred part of the case as pleaded falls
within the
limitation period.  The plaintiffs submitted that it would be prejudicial to
both the court and the plaintiff if this
evidence has to be put before the
court on 2 occasions.  The plaintiff submitted that while they do not put in
dispute the assumed
facts tendered by the first defendant they submit that
those facts are incomplete.  In relation to the limitation period in relation
to the sections of the <b>Local Government Acts</b>, the plaintiff will submit
that the notices issued were invalid and the limitation period does not
apply.
<P>

14	It is my view that even determining the limitation issues and the other
preliminary points will take a great deal longer than
half a day but I accept
that it will be much shorter than running the trial for liability and quantum.
The whole case will take some
considerable period of court time.  Even if the
trials of liability and quantum were severed it is my view that both the
hearing
on liability and on quantum will be classed as long matters.  
<P>

15	As some of the claims fall within the limitation period the determination of
the preliminary questions of law will not obviate
the necessity of litigation
altogether.  However, the results are likely to substantially narrow the field
of controversy and save
costs and time of the parties in compiling 40 years
worth of documents.  My reservation in ordering a determination of these
preliminary
issues is that it will require the court to embark on a detailed
analysis of the facts, particularly as to the circumstances by which
the second
defendant built a public road on part of the premises known as the Hotel
Charles in 1959/60.  
<P>

16	To narrow the facts that need to be traversed in the limitation argument,
the parties are to formulate a statement of agreed
facts and state of disputed
facts that need to be determined.  This will give the plaintiffs the chance to
add to the facts they
consider incomplete.  It is my view that on balance it is
convenient and in the interest of justice to determine the preliminary
questions set out by the first and second defendant.
<P>

17	As the plaintiff opposed the orders sought, the appropriate order for costs
is that the plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

18	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Order in accordance with paragraph (1) of the first defendant's notice of
motion filed 8 January 1999.
<P>

(2)	Order in accordance with paragraph (1) of the second defendant's notice of
motion filed 14 January 1999.
<P>

(3)	The parties are to file a statement of agreed facts and statement of facts
in dispute within 2 months.
<P>

(4)	Upon the filing of these documents, the matter is to be placed in the
holding list.  1 Day +
<P>

(5)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of the motions.
