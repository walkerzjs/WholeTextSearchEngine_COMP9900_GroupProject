<b>CONFIDENTIAL</b>
<P>

<b>RE:  THE APPLICATION OF M.</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  This is a private and unopposed Adoption Application made by a
relative of the child.  The plaintiff is the great-aunt
of the child.  The
Director-General of the Department of Community Services has consented to the
adoption; that consent is required
by sub-section 18(2) of the Adoption of
Children Act 1985, as a great-aunt is not a relative to whom the exception in
Paragraph 18(2)(b)
applies; see the definition of "relative" in s 6.  I have
considered the application in Private Chambers.
<P>

2	Where an application is made by a relative consideration by the Court of the
welfare and interests of the child concerned, which
is to be regarded as the
paramount consideration  - see s 17 - requires me to address whether the
existing family relationship is
in some way adverse to the welfare and
interests of the child in the making of an Adoption Order.  The existence of a
natural family
relationship between the child and the adopting parent suggests
that it is possible that there may be confusion for the child about
relationships and family roles if the adopting parent and other relatives have
several family ties to the child.  There are sources
of confusion which do not
arise in the lives of children generally.  The Adoption of Children Act does
not show any signs of a policy
adverse to adoptions by relatives, and
applications by relatives are not appraised with any sense that an unusual
degree of scrutiny
is required.  However recurringly Courts have addressed the
impact on the welfare and interests of the child of existing natural
relationships as a possible source of confusion.
<P>

3	A decision of Waddell J  -  <u>Re  Adoption of Children Act</u> was briefly
noted at (1979) 5 Family Law Notes, Note 15 at p 2013; in that case the natural
mother was still alive and was known
by the child, and an order for adoption by
grandparents was made.
<P>

4	The Court of Appeal in England in <u>In Re S (a minor) Adoption or
Custodianship</u>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Fam%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Fam 98</a> concluded in favour of an Adoption Order in
similar circumstances; the view of the Court on the facts of that case was that
an Adoption
Order would promote the child's welfare by minimising the risk that
the state of affairs in which the child lived would be disrupted
in the future;
see Cumming-Bruce LJ at 107.  A number of cases in which there were generally
similar issues were referred to in the
arguments of counsel at 99 and 100.
<P>

5	The child was born on 3 December 1992.  The child's mother was a dependent
personality, and received assistance from relatives,
particularly the plaintiff
for the care of her child and also for the management of her own life.  She
left the child in the plaintiff's
care from time to time.  Her health was very
poor.  After several earlier attempts she committed suicide in April 1995.  The
child
was then two years of age and was in the temporary care of the plaintiff.
The child has since then remained in the care of the plaintiff,
who has
actually borne all parental responsibilities for her since then.  
<P>

<b>6	</b>The child's father at one time lived in a de facto relationship with
the mother.  However he did not at any time undertake parental
responsibilities
in a significant way, he acceded to the child remaining with the plaintiff
after the mother's death, and he has
never expressed any intention to take
responsibility for the child's upbringing, provide her with a home, or take any
other step.
 All he has done has been to leave her in the plaintiff's care.
The plaintiff obtained a custody order made by a Local Court Magistrate
under
the Family Law Act, which the father did not oppose.  The father has never made
any contribution to the child's maintenance
by the plaintiff.  He has not seen
the child since late in 1995, about the time the child turned three.  
<P>

7	The father cannot now be located.  The plaintiff has filed affidavit evidence
showing extensive inquiries for him.  All reasonable
avenues of inquiry have
been exhausted without success and it is not practically possible to give him
notice of this application.
 Having regard to his behaviour in the past it is
extremely unlikely that he would oppose the application.  
<P>

8	The evidence shows that four grounds exist on each of which the Court should
dispense with the father's consent; the grounds in
sub-s 32(1)(a)  -  after
reasonable inquiry he cannot be found, subs 32(1)(c)  -  in the opinion of the
Court he is unfit to discharge
the obligations of the parent by reason of his
having abandoned the child, subs 32 (1)(d)  -  he has for over one year failed
without
reasonable cause to discharge the obligations of a parent or to make
suitable arrangements to discharge the obligations of a parent
and subs
32(1)(e)  -  the child is in the care of a foster parent, has established a
stable relationship with the foster parent,
and her interests and welfare will
be promoted by remaining in the care of the foster parent.
<P>

9	It is plain that the application should be granted in all respects other than
the consideration which I should give to the natural
relationship between the
plaintiff and the child.  The plaintiff is the great-aunt of the child; the
child's mother was the daughter
of the plaintiff's sister.  Where there is a
generational gap the interests of the child may be adversely affected by
introducing
complexities into the natural relationships.  I have given careful
consideration to the impact on the interests of the child of introducing
such a
complexity here.  In my view there is potentially an adverse impact of that
kind in that the child will at a later time have
to come to terms with unusual
complexities in the bonds of relationship:  her aunt by adoption will also be
her natural grandmother,
and there will be other complexities of similar kinds.
Although this may cause the child some concern, in every other respect the
proposed adoption is very strongly in the child's interest.  
<P>

10	The proposed adopting parent, who has never been married, has the child's
interests at heart and has protected and advanced them
all the child's life.
She has been a figure in the child's life at all times since she was born and
has been the only person to discharge
parental responsibility for the child for
almost four years.  She does not have a similar responsibility for any other
child.  The
natural mother has died, and there is no reasonable prospect that
the child's father will ever take any real part in the child's
life and
upbringing.  The plaintiff has well-considered and realistic plans to discharge
the responsibilities of a parent which will
maintain for the child continuing
contact with a circle of relatives.  In the whole balance of the child's
interests the potential
adverse impacts are of small importance.
<P>

11	In these circumstances I will make an order of adoption.
