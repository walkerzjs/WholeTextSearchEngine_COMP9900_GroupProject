THURSDAY 16 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>20688/97</u>	<u>TASSY ZAMPETIDES v STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff was born on 2 March 1952 (he is now 47 years of
age).  He left school in 1968.  He obtained qualifications as
a
fitter/machinist.
<P>

2  	I shall mention some of his pre-injury employment.  Between about
1968 - 1979 and 1980 - 1982 he worked for BHP.  He was involved
in community
work until 1988 (during this period he spent a year of study at Baptist
Theological College).  On 31 January 1989, he
commenced employment with the
Department of Corrective Services.  Initially, he started as a prison officer.
Later, he worked as
an overseer and mainly with young offenders.  Since 1
September 1994, he has not worked. On 21 July 1998, he was retired from his
employment with the defendant on medical grounds.
<P>

3  	On 5 July 1986, he was married.  His wife has not been in
employment.  There are four children of the marriage.  The children
were born
during the period between 1987 and 1994.  The fourth child was born shortly
after he suffered injury.
<P>

4  	He suffered injury in an accident that took place on 1 September
1994 at Parklea Prison.  He was overseeing two prisoners. 
There was an
explosion and he suffered severe and extensive burning.  There was burning to
the face, neck, upper and lower limbs,
lower abdomen, trunk and airways.  The
burning extended to 50 - 70% of his body.  Much of the unaffected areas of his
body have been
used for skin grafting.  There is extensive scarring.
<P>

5  	Following the accident, he spent six months in Westmead Hospital
and three months at Mt Wilga.  There have been seven hospital
admissions and
twenty operations.
<P>

6  	The accident injuries have left the plaintiff with a number of
disabilities.  I shall refer to some of them (a detailed description
has been
provided by Dr Buckley).  He has recurring cellulitis and mild lymphodema.
There are eating and breathing problems.  He
is susceptible to skin breakdown,
the occurrence of which is unpredictable.  It can be caused by trauma.  Skin
breakdown requires
treatment (this is mainly provided by a nurse).  There has
been a loss of dexterity and mobility.  This loss creates a need for services.
He needs special equipment for his motor vehicle.  He cannot crouch or squat.
He is unable to access a bath.  Skin problems require
changes of bed linen.
This saw a use of laundry services.  He has to avoid exposure to sun.  He needs
an air conditioned environment
(which is subject to his control).  He suffers
from back and leg pain.  He also experiences hand pain.  He has a reflux
problem.
 There are sexual problems.  There has been a deterioration in his
hearing.  He avoids crowds and public transport (because of the
risk of
injury).  He restricts social activities (because of his dislike of people
staring at him).  His choice of clothing is restricted.
 There has been a need
for pharmaceuticals (including a moisturiser).  His matrimonial relationship
and his relationship with his
children has been adversely affected.  He has had
suicidal thoughts (he has found that doing some woodwork has been beneficial).
He can be expected to undergo surgery, at regular intervals, during the
remainder of his life.  There is a continuing need for nursing
care (about 50
attendances per annum plus additional care following surgery).  He has had
trauma counselling services.
<P>

7  	He is mostly independent in self care.  Prior to the accident he
had assisted his wife with domestic matters and was a keen
handyman.  He is
limited in his ability to perform domestic tasks (such as cooking and cleaning)
and handyman activities.  
<P>

8  	He had enjoyed his work.  He had hopes of promotion to a
middle-management level (either Assistant Superintendent of inter alia
the
metal shop or Senior Assistant Superintendent).  Initially, he had hoped to be
able to return to employment with the defendant.
 Some arrangements made with
Workright did not come to fruition.  There was an approach to WorkCase (a
rehabilitation service provider).
 This threw up the suggestion that he may
have a capacity for telemarketing work.  This suggestion fell by the wayside.
Ultimately,
it was concluded that there were no suitable vocational options
available for the plaintiff.
<P>

9  	Prior to the accident he had played golf, squash, ten-pin bowling
and backyard soccer with his son.  He can no longer perform
these activities.
He did do a lot of fishing prior to his marriage.  He says that as a
consequence of the accident, he would not
now contemplate fishing.
<P>

10  	Initially, the hearing of the proceedings took place before
Sperling J.  After the hearing had proceeded for some days, settlement
was
reached on the question of liability.  Judgment was entered for the plaintiff
against the defendant for damages to be assessed.
 There was agreement reached
between the parties that the assessed damages were to be reduced by 22% for
contributory negligence.
 The assessment of damages was then referred to a
Master.
<P>

11  	The assessment of damages commenced on 13 September 1999 and
initially proceeded over 5 days.  The hearing resumed on 15 November
1999 and
concluded on 17 November 1999.  The actual hearing time well exceeded the
original estimate of 5 days and ultimately occupied
eight hearing days.  The
heads of damage are voluminous (a schedule of damages has been prepared -
Exhibit N), with some novel features.
 Although the quantification of many of
them has been reached by agreement, a formidable range of issues has been left
for resolution
by the court.
<P>

12  	The task left to the court is a daunting one.  It was the
subject of both written and oral submissions.
<P>

13  	Numerous witnesses have been called.  A vast volume of
documentation has been tendered (including many reports from experts).
<P>

14  	On behalf of the plaintiff, oral evidence has been given by many
witnesses (including both the plaintiff and his wife).  It
is now unnecessary
to expressly refer to all of the witnesses called on his behalf.  Accordingly,
I shall in due course restrict
reference to certain of those witnesses whose
evidence has relevance to the issues left to the court.
<P>

15  	On behalf of the defendant, in addition to documentary material,
oral evidence has been given by various expert witnesses.
 Largely, this
material was restricted to matters which remained in issue at the time of the
commencement of the defendant's case.
<P>

16  	I did closely observe the demeanour of witnesses during the
giving of evidence.  Largely, the credibility of the plaintiff
has not been in
issue.  He presented as an intelligent and articulate man.  There has been
conflicting evidence.  Largely, it has
come from expert witnesses and
credibility has not been raised as an issue.
<P>

17  	I now turn to the heads of damages that remain in issue.  It has
been agreed amongst the parties, that the court should proceed
to make findings
on these matters and then publish its reasons.  The parties can then proceed to
make such further submissions and/or
final calculations as may be necessary for
the assessment of the  judgment sum.
<P>

18  	The unresolved heads of damages have been described as
follows:-
<P>

1.	Non-economic loss;
<P>

2.	Past loss of superannuation;
<P>

3.	Future Medical Treatment Expenses;
<P>

(a)	Psychology/psychiatric expenses;
<P>

(b)	Occupational therapy expenses;
<P>

(c)	Pharmaceutical;
<P>

(d)	Hearing aid;
<P>

4.	Future handyman/home maintenance assistance;
<P>

5.	Pool maintenance/cleaning;
<P>

6.	Avocational/diversional therapy claim;
<P>

7.	Home modification costs;
<P>

8.	Additional maintenance running costs building running costs and recurring
expenses;
<P>

9.	Laundry service costs;
<P>

10.	Additional land acquisition;
<P>

11.	Allowance for GST implication effective 1 July 2000 in respect of future
goods and services;  and
<P>

12.	Interest.
<P>

19  	Before setting to deal with the disputed heads of damage, I
should digress to mention the matter of loss of earning capacity.
 Initially,
this was a contentious matter.  The case for the plaintiff was that he did not
realistically have any earning capacity.
 The defendant was contending that he
did have a residual earning capacity.  This head of damage was resolved during
the hearing.
 The court was told that it was resolved on the basis that the
defendant would not be putting any submission to the effect that the
plaintiff
did have a residual earning capacity.
<P>

20  	It is probably best to first deal with the claims for land
acquisition costs and home modification costs.  The claims are related.
 Claims
for home modification costs have been looked at in decided cases (both in
Australia and overseas).  The cases have seen an
expression of diversity of
opinion.  There are cases in which the court has allowed the marginal cost of
securing suitable accommodation
(see inter alia <u>Nicholson v Nicholson</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35 NSWLR 308).</a>  At least generally speaking, the cases have taken the
approach that each claim must be viewed in the light of its own particular
circumstances (more recently <u>Weideck v Williams</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/346.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA 346).</a>  The
court takes into account the circumstances of the plaintiff prior to injury,
what has happened since that time and what is likely
to happen in the future.
In the present case, this approach was embraced by both parties and there was
limited reference to the decided
cases.  The relevant consideration was said to
be that of reasonableness.
<P>

21  	In <u>Sharman v Evans</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%2d1978%29%20138%20CLR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977-1978) 138 CLR 563</a> at 573,
emphasis was placed on the distinction between ideal and reasonable
requirements.  It was said that the touchstone of reasonableness
involves the
matching of costs against benefits.
<P>

22  	The starting point is the material available to the court
concerning the plaintiff's circumstances.  This material has its
deficiencies.
There is some uncertainty as to the relevant circumstances.
<P>

23  	It would seem that the plaintiff has not been a home owner.  He
had lived at inter alia Pendle Hill, Quakers Hill and Toongabbie
(in the
Parklea area).  At the time of the accident, the plaintiff and his family were
residing in rented accommodation (a three
bedroom average size brick house).
After his discharge from Mt Wilga, they made a move to "larger accommodation".
In the five years
since the accident, they have continued to reside in rented
premises.
<P>

24  	The present accommodation (a plan of which may be found in
Exhibit C) is said to have disadvantages for a person with the plaintiff's
disabilities.  I shall mention certain matters.  It has a sloping driveway.  It
has a salt water swimming pool which is not heated
(it had been a heated pool
but the plaintiff said that the heating is broken and the agent refused to fix
it).  There is air conditioning
(but the house is not fully air conditioned).
It has a small en suite shower and narrow doorways.  There is a lack of
storage.  The
view has been taken that it cannot be altered to suit the
disabilities because it is not owned by the plaintiff.  Since the accident,
the
plaintiff has not had the means to enable him to purchase a home.
<P>

25  	The transcript records various questions and answers concerning
the matters of pre-accident intention.  It would not be productive
to repeat
all of that material.  I shall mention some matters.  At some stage prior to
the accident, the plaintiff took steps towards
purchasing a property (a three
bedroom brick house).  Prior to the signing of the contract, he did not proceed
with the proposed
purchase (he felt uncomfortable about proceeding with the
purchase and then the proposed financier went broke).  Thereafter, he took
steps to earn more money.  There was a transfer which gave him a better wage.
He said that the buying of a house with a pool was
within his pre-accident
financial capacity.  He was looking towards an established house (because they
had more space) within the
reasonable vicinity of Parklea.  The evidence of
intention to buy a home was dependent on financial capacity and in one answer
had
the effect of being "in due course".  It appears that, at the time of the
accident, he was not searching for a home to buy.  He was
facing the additional
expense of a fourth child.  It would seem that a purchase (if it was to happen)
was not likely to happen for
some time (at least not in the immediate
future).
<P>

26  	The plaintiff's case is that because of his injuries he needs an
architecturally designed home which because of its features
will require the
acquisition of a larger than normal block of land.  The land is to be located
in what has been described as the
Hills area and having proximity to Westmead
Hospital.
<P>

27  	The plaintiff was asked a question relating to recommendations
made by Dr Buckley.  His answer was to the effect that, depending
on the
compensation awarded in these proceedings, the recommendations related to the
type of home that he would attempt to have built
for himself.
<P>

28  	He said that he was familiar with the report and recommendations
of Mr Mazaraki.  He gave an answer to the effect that generally
speaking that
was the type of home he would like built if he were able to afford it.
Further, he said that if he was going to build
he would prefer a five bedroom
home.
<P>

29  	The claim contemplates a double brick four bedroom home.
Costings have been provided for both an "Able-Bodied" and a "Disabled"
home.
The "Disabled" home was designed by the architect in the light of the criteria
(or special requirements) made known to him
by the plaintiff's legal advisers
(the material included expert reports).  Broadly speaking, the plaintiff seeks
to recover the difference.
<P>

30  	I shall now mention some of the particular features.  There is
said to be a requirement for larger than normal rooms, hallways,
and doorways
so as to reduce the possibility of risk of damage by bumping against surfaces.
There is said to be a requirement that
the house should have flat access.
There is said to be a requirement for air conditioning throughout the house.
There is said to
be a need for a workshop (the plaintiff has given evidence of
the benefit derived from performing limited woodwork activities). 
There is
said to be a need for a special multi-purpose room (to locate a computer and
exercise equipment and so that he can be alone
and not under his wife's feet).
There is said to be a need for a heated swimming pool.  There is said to be a
need for other various
special requirements located in the bathroom, kitchen,
main bedroom and en suite.  There was said to be a need for a larger than
normal double garage.
<P>

31  	The defendant stresses that there is no evidence from one of the
plaintiff's principal treating doctors (Dr Thompson).  Largely,
the expert
material relied on by the plaintiff is provided by Dr Buckley (a specialist in
rehabilitation medicine) and Miss Lukersmith
(an occupational therapist) on the
one hand and Mr Sorrenson (a valuer), Mr Mazaraki (an architect) and Mr
Parkinson (a quantity
surveyor) on the other hand.  There is also the evidence
from the plaintiff and his wife.
<P>

32  	The defendant strongly challenges the assertion of a need for an
architecturally designed home on a larger than normal block
of land
(expressions such as "exaggerated" and "over the top" were ventilated during
submissions).  The defendant contends that the
evidence falls well short of
demonstrating a need for most of the alleged special requirements and directs
attention to what has
actually been said by the medical experts and the
occupational therapist.  It is said that the needs of the plaintiff can be met
by merely making such modifications (as may be necessary) to facilities in any
home acquired by the plaintiff.  As an alternative,
it says that the needs can
be met by modifications to a project home.  Evidence was offered in relation to
project homes (described
as a "Greenway" and as a "Capricorn").  This evidence
was provided by reports and oral evidence from Messrs Jackman and Byrne.  The
defendant further contends that the plaintiff may have never made the move from
rented accommodation to a purchased home.  As a further
alternative it says
that, he could be provided with a lump sum in the order of $125,120 to enable
him to rent a slightly larger house.
<P>

33  	At this stage, it is convenient to deal with the question of
what are the plaintiff's special requirements.
<P>

34  	In the particular circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied
that the plaintiff has a need for an architecturally designed
home which has to
be located on a larger than normal block of land.  In my view, such an approach
represents an extravagance lacking
evidentiary support.  It seems to me, that
such special requirements as he does have can be reasonably met by suitable
modifications.
 The extent of what would have to be done to meet those
requirements involves a number of imponderables.
<P>

35  	In many respects, it appears that inter alia the architect has
proceeded on the basis of criteria which lacks justification
when regard is had
to relevant evidence.  The evidence given by Dr Buckley is confined to such
matters as the need for flat access,
for air conditioning, for specially
designed taps, light switches and door handles, a pool and a utility room.  The
evidence (including
that from the plaintiff himself) does not support the
contention that there is a reasonable requirement (or even a need as such)
for
larger rooms (including the double garage), doors and hallways.  This is not a
case where the plaintiff uses a wheelchair and
wheelchair access is required in
the house.  Since the accident, for about five years, he has been living in
rented accommodation
which does not have these features.  I am not satisfied
that it would be reasonable, in the circumstances of this case, to impose
a
burden on the defendant of meeting the cost of larger than normal rooms and
doorways.
<P>

36  	The acquisition of a dwelling on a flat surface should not
present any real problem.  There is a need for air conditioning.
 Whilst it may
be helpful (or go towards what may be described as the ideal state of affairs)
if the plaintiff did have such facilities,
I am not satisfied that there is a
reasonable requirement for either a multi-purpose room or a workshop.  I am not
satisfied that
it would be reasonable, in the circumstances of this case, to
impose the cost burden of those facilities upon the defendant.  Perhaps,
some
additional observations should be made in relation to the workshop.  The
plaintiff says that he has done a little bit of woodwork
over the last 12
months.  He is very slow and has to be careful.  I should add that Dr Buckley
had some real concern about the danger
to the plaintiff posed by workshop
activities.  The plaintiff had injured himself a few times whilst engaged in
such activities.
 It would be reasonable for provision to be made for
facilities such as special taps, light switches and doorhandles and some
additional
storage space.  His limited user of kitchen facilities inter alia
does not justify the alleged requirement for a larger kitchen and
substantial
modifications.  There may be a reasonable requirement for some other
modifications (such as to inter alia the bathroom
and kitchen).  What may have
to be done, will depend largely on what may be acquired.
<P>

37  	In a report, Dr Buckley proposed that any residence have
available a hydrotherapy pool with water heated to approximately 30.
 Further,
he proposed that the pool should have automatic cleaning and disinfecting
systems.  Further, he expressed the view that
because of the plaintiff's
susceptibility to sunburn the pool should have shading for summer and in order
to make it useful during
the winter it requires enclosure.
<P>

38  	The purpose of a pool is for exercise.  Dr Buckley was of the
view that it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to have to use
a public
swimming pool.  The plaintiff said that he used the pool a fair bit in summer.
It was good for his legs and gave him an
opportunity to socialise with his
children.
<P>

39  	There is evidence from the plaintiff concerning the question of
the pool (inter alia, he intended to buy a house with a pool
(or to install a
pool) for the children's use or family use).  In the light of all of the
material on this question, I am not satisfied
that he would not have had a pool
in any event.  On behalf of the plaintiff, it was conceded that it may be open
on the evidence
to calculate damages on the basis that there would be a pool in
any home acquired by him and that compensation should be for the
extra
facilities (inter alia such as costs of heating and covering).
<P>

40  	Whilst I am not satisfied that it would be reasonable to impose
the costs of a pool on the defendant, it seems to me to be
reasonable that the
calculation of damages should take into account the possibility of the need for
heating and for providing of
sun protection (but not the enclosure
structure).
<P>

41  	These heads of damage have seen a very large claim (the
plaintiff has claimed $308,395 for home modification costs and $50,000
for
additional land acquisition costs).  As appears from what has been earlier
said, I am not satisfied, in the circumstances of
this case, that it would be
reasonable to allow the claim for home modification costs as propounded by the
plaintiff and any claim
for additional land acquisition costs.
<P>

42  	I now turn to the question of what would be reasonable in the
circumstances of this case.  I have already made mention of evidentiary
deficiencies.  Generally speaking the material is less than helpful.  What may
have happened, but for the injury, is far from clear.
 What may now happen in
the future also has its uncertainty.  The best that can be done, in the
circumstances, is to conclude that
there has been and may be in the future the
possibility of a move to purchased premises.
<P>

43  	I am of the view that it would be reasonable to make allowance
for the possibilities of home acquisition and the need for some
modification to
make such a home suitable for his requirements.  The task involves the
valuation of chances.  The amount to be allowed
has to take into account a
variety of contingencies.  As has been said, there are many imponderables.  It
seems to me that assessment
of amount is best done on a global basis.  The
parties accept that this is an approach which may have application in this
case. 
Unavoidably, the exercise has an arbitrary element.  It may be that in
the light of my findings, the parties can reach a consensus
as to the
appropriate figure.  If this cannot be done, I consider that I should hear
further submissions on the question.
<P>

44  	A claim is made for past loss of superannuation in the sum of
$13,174.96.  There is agreement as to mathematics.  However,
the defendant says
that this is a deferred benefit and that the plaintiff is entitled only to the
present value of the superannuation
benefits.  It is common ground that the
plaintiff is not presently entitled to these benefits and no argument is
advanced to justify
the plaintiff's quantification of this head of damage
(despite the opportunity having been given to make additional submissions in
writing on this question).  Accordingly I allow the present value of the gross
benefits ($5,480.78).
<P>

45  	A claim is made for psychology/psychiatric costs in the sum of
$39,596.80.  This is calculated on the basis of an expenditure
of $46 per week
for the remainder of his life (which is 33.68 years).
<P>

46  	There is evidence that psychiatric or psychological consultation
would be of benefit for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff has
not had any
psychiatric treatment.  He has had counselling from a psychologist.  The cost
of that treatment has diminished over the
years.  There is potential for the
seeking of treatment in the future.  It may be better provided by a
psychiatrist.
<P>

47  	The defendant does not dispute that there is a need.  But it
says that the need is not ongoing.  It says that a buffer should
be provided.
It has suggested that it be in the order of $7,500 or $5,000.
<P>

48  	It seems to me that this is not a claim that can be calculated
with mathematical precision.  Again, the calculation has an
arbitrary element.
It is also best dealt with on a global basis.  I allow the sum of $15,000.
<P>

49  	There is a claim for occupational therapy in the sum of $20,851.
Largely, this claim depends on the evidence of Miss Lukersmith.
 She has seen
him for the purpose of these proceedings.  She says that there is a need for
services.  So far the plaintiff has not
utilised such services.  However, there
is a potential for future use.
<P>

50  	The defendant says that this claim can be met by allowing the
sum of $5,000.  In the circumstances of this case it seems to
me that it is
best dealt with also on a global basis.  Doing the best I can in the
circumstances, I allow the sum of $10,000.
<P>

51  	The claim for pharmaceutical expenses falls into two categories.
There was a claim for the costs of a moisturiser.  This claim
is calculated on
the basis of the plaintiff incurring costs at the rate of $127 per week a total
of $109,321 is claimed.  The balance
of the claim relates to other
pharmaceutical items.  These are claimed at the rate of $65 per week a total of
$55,952 is claimed.
 The total of the claim for pharmaceutical expenses is
$165,273.60.  The defendant is prepared to allow $90,363.
<P>

52  	Although it is not medically prescribed, there is indisputably a
need for a moisturiser.  The need may well persist for the
rest of his life.
<P>

53  	The plaintiff has used a number of products.  For some time, he
has used an Amway product known as Artistry.  This product
has proved to be
satisfactory.  Unfortunately, it is considerably more expensive than other
products on the market.  Until recently,
the defendant has been meeting the
cost of this product.
<P>

54  	There are other products on the market which have not been the
subject of trial use by the plaintiff.  During the period between
September and
November this year, the plaintiff did trial another product suggested by the
defendant.  The trial was unsatisfactory.
<P>

55  	An unsuccessful trial of a product may subject the plaintiff to
considerable pain, suffering and expense.  If it be so suggested
by the
defendant, I do not accept that he is obliged to trial all products suggested
by the defendant.
<P>

56  	The medical evidence suggests that the appropriate product for a
patient is a matter of trial and error.  What may be appropriate
for one
person, may not be appropriate for another.  There are individual responses to
each product.
<P>

57  	In my view, it is reasonable to make an allowance for the cost
of Artistry.  I consider that some discount should be allowed
for
contingencies.
<P>

58  	The dispute in respect of the claim for other pharmaceuticals in
the future concerns its quantification.  There is the possibility
of some
diminution of user over the years.  I consider that some discount should be
made to the claim made by the plaintiff.
<P>

59  	For this head of damage I allow the global sum of $145,000.
<P>

60  	There is a claim for a hearing aid in the sum of $12,770.78.
This is a claim which is dealt with in written submissions.  It
did not receive
much consideration in oral argument.
<P>

61  	There is some conflicting evidence as to causation (Drs Scoppa
and Seymour).  The plaintiff has said that his hearing has deteriorated
since
the accident.  He had hearing problems prior to the accident.  There is
evidence which relates some hearing loss to the accident.
 The plaintiff's
evidence which relates to this head of damage was not the subject of
cross-examination.  In the light of the material,
I have come to the view that
I should prefer the evidence offered on behalf of the plaintiff on the question
of causation.
<P>

62  	It has been observed that during the giving of his evidence the
plaintiff did not appear to be suffering from any hearing problem.
 However,
the circumstances in which evidence was given lacked the presence of background
noise which might be experienced in other
circumstances.
<P>

63  	There is evidence that his hearing loss could be helped by a
hearing aid.  He says he has not worn one because he has not been
able to
afford it.  He says that he would wear a hearing aid if he could afford it.
<P>

64  	The defendant says that if such a claim is to be allowed, the
quantification of it should be in a reduced sum.  I am not satisfied
that the
claim can be allowed in full.  The accident relates to only part of his
problems.  There are contingencies to be taken into
account.  The
quantification also has an arbitrary element.   Doing the best I can in the
circumstances, I allow the sum of $8,000
for this head of damage.
<P>

65  	The plaintiff claims the sum of $94,688 for future handyman/home
maintenance assistance.  This is calculated on an agreed rate
of $22 per hour
for five hours per week.  It is a claim for the activity that he had carried
out prior to the accident but does not
do so now because of his injuries.  The
defendant has disputed the quantification of this claim.
<P>

66  	There is conflicting evidence as to the quantum of assistance
that may be required per week.  The plaintiff claims some capability
for these
activities.  The extent of the handyman assistance required in the future has
its imponderables.  It will depend on his
future living arrangements.  There
are other contingencies.  In my view, doing the best I can in the
circumstances, it would be reasonable
to allow the sum of $64,000.
<P>

67  	The claim for pool maintenance and cleaning is in the sum of
$86,593.  The written submissions for the plaintiff are unhelpful
on this
matter.  The oral submissions were brief.  There seems to be some overlapping
with a claim made for "additional maintenance.......".
 The dispute goes to the
quantification of his claim.  The evidence relied on has deficiencies.
Contingencies need to be taken into
account.  On the present submissions (or
lack of them), I am unable to assess this head of damage.  If it cannot be
resolved by consensus,
I will require further submissions.
<P>

68  	The claim for avocational/diversional therapy is in the sum of
$113,172 (capital $14,677;  recurring $98,495).  It involves
a claim for what
might be described as special computer equipment (see evidence of Mr Smith).  I
am not satisfied that it would be
reasonable to provide him with the equipment
recommended by Mr Smith at the defendant's cost.  In my view, such special
equipment
is well in excess of the plaintiff's need.
<P>

69  	Prior to the accident, the plaintiff did not own a computer.
Following his injury, the defendant provided him with a computer.
 The aim was
to assist his return to work.  There is a significant use of the current
computer equipment by the plaintiff's children.
 It was purchased for them.  A
computer  is used mainly by him for correspondence.  He is dependent upon it
for written communication
needs.  His skills are largely self taught.  He does
not intend to upgrade his computer skills.  He would like to use the computer
for future educational purposes.  It affords other benefits.  I bear in mind
that his damages are being assessed on the basis that
he will not work again
and that a computer is not required for income earning purposes.  I consider
that a reasonable allowance should
be made for a computer facility.  Again,
there are contingencies to be taken into account.
<P>

70  	The defendant's basic position is that no allowance should be
made in respect of this claim.  As an alternative, it suggests
a buffer in the
sum of $10,000 (in the written submissions).  For completeness, I notice that
Exhibit N refers to a sum of $2,000
(this would appear to erroneously state the
defendant's position).
<P>

71  	It seems to me that the task of quantification is best
approached by awarding a lump sum which takes into account the imponderables
of
the future.  I allow the total sum of $25,000.
<P>

72  	There is the claim for additional maintenance, running costs,
building running costs and recurring expenses in the sum of $194,640.
 Again,
there is dispute as to quantification.  In my view, the submissions presently
made in relation to this head of damage are
not sufficient to enable me to deal
with it.  Because of the multitude of claims made, it may have been another of
the matters that
have been somewhat overlooked.  I need further submissions on
this matter if it cannot be resolved by consensus. 
<P>

73  	The claim for laundry service is in the sum of $98,992.  This
claim is calculated on the basis that laundry costs will be incurred
at the
rate of $115 per week.  The defendant does not dispute that some allowance
should be made.  It says that the claim is excessive
and should be reduced to
$25,824 being an allowance for 2 days per week ($30 per week).
<P>

74  	Laundry is soiled by inter alia blood, leakage, skin and the
moisturiser.  There is conflict in the evidence.  Apart from the
oral evidence
of the plaintiff and his wife, there is some conflicting documentation
(comprising part of a statement of Prudence
Martin and the plaintiff's response
thereto). The evidentiary position is less than satisfactory.
<P>

75  	There is a possibility of improvement in the future.  The sheets
may not have to be sent to a laundry.  Other circumstances
may change.  The
future is largely imponderable.
<P>

76  	In my view, doing the best that can be done in the
circumstances, it would be reasonable to allow the global sum of $40,000
for
this claim.
<P>

77  	The claim made for a GST allowance is in the sum of $81,000.  It
is a novel claim and has been the subject of little argument.
 It has been
suggested that the determination of this matter should be stood over pending
giving to the parties the opportunity to
consider the findings made in relation
to other disputed claims.  It seems to me that that is the best course to adopt
in this case.
<P>

78  	Finally, I turn to the claim for non-economic loss.  The
plaintiff says that he should be treated as a most extreme case. 
The defendant
accepts a position of 80% of a most extreme case.
<P>

79  	In my view, when regard is had to the particular circumstances
of this case, non-economic loss should be assessed on the basis
of 92% of a
most extreme case.
<P>
