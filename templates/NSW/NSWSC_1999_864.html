<P>

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<u>20849/1997</u>	<u>MIKIKO YAMAZAKI v JOHN MUSTACA &amp; ORS.</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings are brought pursuant to the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ctra1897288/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation To
Relatives Act</u> 1897</a>.  Initially, there were four plaintiffs.  The first
plaintiff was the widow of the late Tetsuya Yamazaki (the deceased).  The other
plaintiffs were children of the marriage.  The process has been amended on a
number of occasions.  There is now only one plaintiff
(the widow) who brings
the claim on behalf of herself and the children.
<P>

2  	On or about 5 August 1996, the deceased was on premises known as
1 Dell Street Belrose (the premises).  He had attended the
premises for the
purposes of playing tennis.  He suffered injury in a fall and died.
<P>

3  	The case as presently pleaded is to be found in a Second Further
Amended Statement of Claim.  The court was told that it had
been filed in June
1999.  Its predecessor was an Amended Statement of Claim filed on 12 January
1998.
<P>

4  	There are five defendants.  It is alleged that the first and
second defendants were the owners of the premises.  It is alleged
that the
third, fourth and/or fifth defendant were carrying on the business of a tennis
academy and school at the premises.  It is
alleged that the fall was caused by
negligence.
<P>

5  	In December 1998, the plaintiff brought proposed interrogatories
to the attention of the defendants.  The plaintiff was told
that leave was
required to serve a notice to amend interrogatories.  On 25 February 1999, the
plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion.
 The application sought inter alia leave to
file and serve notices to answer interrogatories.
<P>

6  	The application came before Registrar Irwin.  He delivered a
written decision on 6 April 1999.  The Registrar refused the application
for
leave to administer interrogatories to the third, fourth and fifth
defendants.
<P>

7  	On 4 May 1999, the plaintiff filed a further Notice of Motion.
It sought a review of the decision made by the Registrar.  The
application was
heard on 5 August 1999.  Apart from documentation tendered during submissions,
the material consisted of the documentation
contained in a folder produced by
the plaintiff.
<P>

8  	At the outset, it needs to be noted that the application made
before the Registrar laboured under misconception (it was brought
and dealt
with as an application for leave).  The relevant rules are to be found in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p24" class="autolink_findacts">Part
24</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</u> 1970</a>.  The rules make no provision for the
granting of leave to administer interrogatories.
<P>

9  	Rule 1 enables the administration of interrogatories by way of
notice.  This rule has no application in the present case (see
subrule (3); ).
Rule 5 enables the court to make an order against any party to serve a
statement in answer to interrogatories.  The
exercise of the power is expressly
restricted by the prohibition contained in sub-rule (2).  The power cannot be
exercised unless
the court is first satisfied that the order is necessary at
the time when it is made.  When this threshold requirement has been satisfied
there is a discretion to make an order.
<P>

10  	Whilst there have been attempts to do so, in my view, it is not
helpful to embark on an exercise of seeking to define the term
"necessary".  It
has a clear dictionary meaning (inter alia it involves the concept of that
which cannot be done without or dispensed
with).  The task for the court is to
apply that concept to the facts of the particular case before it.  Each case
will turn on its
own particular circumstances.
<P>

11  	Since the matter was before the Registrar, some changes have
taken place.  There is now a Second Further Amended Statement
of Claim.  The
plaintiff has abandoned some of the proposed interrogatories.  There have been
some changes to the remaining interrogatories
which the plaintiff treats as
being of no consequence.  Those which are still pressed appear from the copy
Amended Notice to Answer
Interrogatories (Exhibit A).  There has been a
response to the Amended Notice (Exhibit B).
<P>

12  	The remaining interrogatories are still numerous.  They are
subdivided into five categories.  The first category is headed
"The lease".
The second category is headed "The dog".  The third category is headed "The
elevated garden area and the yard adjacent
to it".  The fourth category is
headed "The gate and the stairs".  The fifth is headed "The tennis courts".
<P>

13  	Before proceeding further, I should briefly mention certain
other matters.  Firstly, I should mention some interlocutory matters.
Secondly, I should mention some further factual background.  Largely, these
matters emerged from what was said from the bar table
or in submissions or
pleadings.
<P>

14  	The court has been told that the plaintiff has not sought
discovery.  Subpoenas have been issued and documents have been produced
(including a lease document which describes a person having the name of the
third defendant as lessee).  There has been inspection
of the premises and
photographs have been taken (including those which appear in Exhibit C).
<P>

15  	It appears that the tennis activities were conducted on part
only of the premises.  There was one tennis court.  It was bounded
on one side
by a paved viewing area.  On the other side of that area was a retaining wall
of about 3 metres in height.  Above the
retaining wall, was an elevated garden
area.  At the time of the injury, the deceased was part of a group playing
tennis.  The activity
started some time after 6.00pm.  The injury was suffered
at about 8.00pm.  It took place when the deceased went to retrieve a tennis
ball hit from the court area by another player.  In the process of endeavouring
to retrieve the ball, the deceased passed through
a gate and went up some
wooden stairs.  They gave access to the elevated garden area.  It is alleged
that in or near this area was
a dog owned by the first and second defendants.
It is alleged that the dog behaved in an aggressive manner.  Two alternatives
are
alleged.  It is said that either because of the dog he walked backwards
through the garden area towards the retaining wall from which
he fell onto the
paved viewing area or that he fell from the elevated garden area onto the paved
viewing area.
<P>

16  	The thrust of the plaintiff's case is that she was not present
at the time of the accident and lacks knowledge of relevant
circumstances.
Attention is also directed to the contents of the Defence filed by the three
defendants.
<P>

17  	The Defence traverses many of the allegations made in the
plaintiff's process.  There is an admission that the fifth defendant
was
carrying on the business of a tennis academy and school at the premises.  The
third, fourth and fifth defendants deny that they
had the care, custody and
control of the premises.
<P>

18  	It might be thought that the case may have been presented by
inter alia evidence adduced from other members of the tennis group
and/or by
way of inference from proven facts (<u>Davis v Bunn</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2056%20CLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 56 CLR 246).</a>
However, for present purposes, I put these considerations aside as they were
not canvassed during the hearing.
<P>

19  	Apart from what has already been the subject of mention in this
judgment, the court has been left uninformed as to the evidence
and other
material available to the plaintiff for the preparation and prosecution of her
case.
<P>

20  	On behalf of the plaintiff, detailed written submissions have
been placed before the court.  These submissions inter alia address
the
responses made to the remaining proposed interrogatories.
<P>

21  	The third, fourth and fifth defendants take the stance that the
plaintiff has failed to satisfy the relevant threshold requirement
(that an
order is necessary in the relevant sense). Further, it was said that in any
event, there were discretionary reasons for
the refusing of an order.  Largely,
these may be found in the response (which inter alia seeks comfort from grounds
identified in
rule 6 (3)).  The response was supplemented by oral argument.
<P>

22  	For the purposes of disposing of this application, it is not
necessary to address the various arguments presented in respect
of each of the
many interrogatories.  The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the court
that an order should be made.  The discharging
of this onus requires the
plaintiff to firstly satisfy the threshold requirement and to secondly satisfy
the court that the discretionary
power should be exercised in her favour.
Because of the stringent nature of the threshold requirement, the burden of
discharging
the onus will largely be a heavy one.
<P>

23  	In this case, there are evidentiary deficiencies.  This may be
due, at least in part, to the misconception had as to the nature
of the relief
that was available under the rules.
<P>

24  	In my view, the threshold requirement has not been satisfied.
In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it
is necessary in
the required sense to make an order.
<P>

25  	Perhaps it may be of assistance, to emphasize the distinction
between that which may have potential to afford assistance to
a party  in the
preparation and prosecution of a case and that which is necessary at the
relevant time.  The court must have before
it the evidence which demonstrates
that an order is necessary in the sense required by the rule.
<P>

26  	I may add that even if I had taken a different view on the
threshold question, I would not have been satisfied that the discretionary
power should have been exercised in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

27  	For completeness I may mention that certain of the
interrogatories have been the subject of sustained criticism (inter alia
as to
matters such as form and relevance).  In the light of the decision that has
been reached, it is unnecessary to dwell on these
matters.  It suffices to say
that there is force in the criticism.
<P>

28  	I dismiss the Notice of Motion.  The plaintiff is to pay the
costs of the Notice of Motion.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
