<b>JUDGMENT  [on Motions to set aside Subpoenas]</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  There are presently before the court several
sets of related proceedings being heard together concerning dealings
between
the parties relating to extensive land holdings at Helensburgh.  Those dealings
led to a heads of agreement document executed
between 11 November and 1
December 1993 pursuant to which an agreement called the Helensburgh Unit Trust
Unit Holders Agreement [`the
HUTA'] dated 6 April 1994 was entered into.
<P>

2   	Central to the disputes between the parties at a factual
level are the circumstances in which attempts were made to secure
the rezoning
of the Helensburgh lands so as to allow a substantial portion thereof to be
developed as a residential subdivision.
 It is common ground that those
attempts were and remain unsuccessful and that a principal claim to relief
pursued by the plaintiffs
arises by the reason of the failure to secure the
rezoning of the subject land.  A number of other grounds of relief are also
pressed.
<P>

3   	Presently before the court for determination are notices of
motion brought by the defendants and outside parties seeking to
set aside a
number of subpoenas to produce documents issued to outside parties.  The
particular notices of motion, the subject of
the argument, are those filed for
Balleroo Pty Ltd [`Balleroo'], first returnable on 10 September 1999 which
appear behind tab six
in the materials marked for identification 5A, and a
further notice of motion filed by Warren Duncan and Paul Dovico also initially
returnable on 10 September 1999, which appear behind tab 8 in the folder marked
for identification 5A.  This motion is sought to
be dismissed by notices of
motion pursued by the plaintiffs which appear behind Tabs 10 and 11 of the same
folder.
<P>

4   	The materials which have been read in support of the
notices of motion are an affidavit by Susan Gay Ougham made on 23 August
1999
in support of the motion relating to Balleroo and an affidavit made by Susan
Gay Ougham on 23 August 1999 in support of the
notice of motion relating to
Messrs Duncan and Dovico.  Also read without  objection by the plaintiffs are
affidavits appearing behind
tabs twelve, thirteen and fourteen in exhibit 5A,
namely, the affidavit of Tania Schiff made on 20 August 1999, the affidavit of
Anthony Gye made on 27 August 1999 and a further affidavit made by Anthony Gye
on 30 September 1999.
<P>

5   	The subpoenas have been answered in the sense that Balleroo
and Messrs Warren Duncan and Paul Dovico have in answer to the
subpoenas, as I
understand the position, produced the documents to the court.
<P>

6   	The Court is then presently at a stage in relation to the
subpoena process referred to by<b> </b>Moffitt P in<b> </b><i>National
Employers' Mutual General Association Limited v Waind and Hill </i>[1978]
1NSWLR 372 at 381 as `the second step', namely, the decision of the court
concerning the preliminary use of the documents,
which includes whether or not
permission should be given to a party or parties to inspect the documents.
<P>

7   	An initial question in relation to the procedure to be
adopted on the hearing of the motions concerns the application pursued
by the
defendants, for whom Mr Shand of Queen's Counsel appears, for leave to
cross-examine Mr Anthony Gye, the plaintiff's solicitor,
the application said
to be based upon the proposition that the subject subpoenas constitute an abuse
of process.
<P>

8   	The submission relies upon the statement made by Ms Ougham
in her affidavits of 23 August 1999 in which she deposes that the
documents
described in the schedule to the subpoena addressed to Balleroo and to Messrs
Duncan and Dovico, require production of
documents held by Balleroo which `do
not relate to any matter pleaded in these proceedings' and applies for the
court to set aside
the subpoenas on the bases that they are said not to have
been issued for a bona fide process and therefore to have constituted an
abuse
of process, that they are oppressive and that they constitute `fishing' by the
second, third and fourth plaintiffs.
<P>

9   	Having heard both senior counsel on Mr Shand's application
for leave to cross-examine Mr Gye, in my view that leave should
not be
granted.
<P>

10   	Rolfe J, in his Honour's judgment of 31 July 1998 in these
proceedings, dealt with a number of subpoenas which had been issued
and dealt
with a number of notices of motion seeking to set aside those subpoenas.  The
judgment included a reasonably detailed examination
of the authorities and of
the principles involved.  His Honour enunciated, in a fashion which I would not
depart from, the basic
parameters which are to inform the court in the exercise
of its discretion where an application to set aside a subpoena is pursued.
<P>

11   	On the one hand, there is clearly to be recognised, the
obvious danger of permitting a party by use of the subpoena procedure,
to
investigate issues of credit having no conceivable relevance to issues pleaded,
in the sense that to permit subpoenas of that
type to be called would open up
matters falling outside the legitimate field of enquiry raised by the issues in
contest.  On the
other hand, it seems to me quite clear that inspection should
be granted, so far as is necessary, in the proper conduct of the  litigation,
where the court forms the view that the material falls within the legitimate
field of enquiry raised by the issues in contest and
is reasonably likely to
add in the end in some way or other to the relevant evidence in the case.  The
exercise, recognised by Rolfe
J, involves the need to balance these alternative
considerations.
<P>

12   	The determination of the Court in the balancing exercise
and in particular the proper approach to the question of relevance,
requires
the court, as Rolfe J indicated, to bear in mind the entitlement of the parties
to build up what his Honour referred to
as `an evidentiary mosaic'.
<P>

13   	As his Honour said, that exercise generally cannot be
done, particularly in complicated commercial litigation, by the tender
of one
piece of evidence or the assertion that only limited material is relevant to
the issues involved.  As his Honour said, `particularly
is that so when one
must have regard to the desirability of as full a cross-examination as
possible, assisted by the availability
of documents which will aid that'.
Hence, as his Honour stated, both as to issues and as to the issue of credit,
the court should
not be astute to find irrelevance at an early stage in the
proceedings.
<P>

14   	In endeavouring to deal with the relevance issue, Mr
Ellicott took the Court through a number of suggested arguable indicia
said to
require the production of the documents sought.  The perceived significance of
the transactions sought to be investigated
using the materials sought to be
produced, was outlined in detail.
<P>

15   	The stage which these proceedings have presently reached
is that in an attempt to familiarise the Court with the issues as
pleaded on 9
March, senior counsel for both parties have opened their cases in detail and
over several days.
<P>

16   	From those openings it is quite plain that there is to be
the clearest of issues as to credit as between the principal witnesses
to be
called by the plaintiffs on the one hand and by the defendants on the other
hand, these being persons who were privy to the
communications between the
parties leading up to the entry into of the heads of agreement and HUTA to
which I have referred.  Rolfe
J had recognised this as an important issue in
his earlier judgment.
<P>

17   	It is not presently appropriate that I review the
plaintiffs' opening in order to make good the proposition that the plaintiffs'
propose in the course of the proceedings, to submit that the defendants were
time and time again and in respect of a number of pleaded
facts and
circumstances, content to breach what are said to have been fiduciary
obligations said to have been owed to their joint
venture partners.
<P>

18   	The plaintiffs propose to submit there was a concerted use
by the defendants of particular companies, including Ibenmore Pty
Limited
(later called Rosamond Pty Ltd), in order to carry out transactions for the
purpose of deliberately advantaging the defendants
against the interests of
their joint venture partners.
<P>

19   	In that regard the plaintiffs' third amended summons sets
out at paragraphs 38 to 86, the specifics of the alleged breaches
of covenant,
and breaches of fiduciary duty, upon which the plaintiffs rely to support their
causes of action. Those paragraphs also
plead alleged breaches of statutory
duty said to arise under Corporation Law section 232 (3) and (4), namely,
breaches by the relevant
defendants of duties as directors of the joint venture
vehicle Rosamond, to act honestly in the exercise of their powers or the
discharge
of their duties as directors, and breaches of duties in like capacity
to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable
person in a like
position in a corporation would exercise in the corporations circumstances.
<P>

20   	In  relation to the allegations now made in the third
amended summons it is sufficient to refer to particular (i) of paragraph
45.
That particular, in referring to donations said to have been made by Rosamond
to the political parties referred to in paragraph
45, reads as follows:
<P>

<i>`Each of the said donations was not made for the benefit of Rosamond but for
the benefit of Walker Corporation Limited, its subsidiaries
and the said
directors.  Rosamond or Ibenmore as it was then known was used by Mr Walker and
Mr Dransfield as a front for Walker
Corporation in order to make substantial
donations perceived to be for the benefit of Walker Corporation, its
subsidiaries and themselves
as directors and shareholders of Walker
Corporation.'</i>
<P>

21   	Another example of a particular allegation to be found in
the third amended summons is to be seen paragraph 62 of the contentions:
<P>

<i>`On or about 20 June 1994 Mr Walker and/or Mr Dransfield and/or Walker
Consolidated procured Mr Thompson for a consideration to grant
to Walker
Consolidated for its own benefit an option to purchase the Thompson Land (the
"Current Thompson Option").  The actions
of Mr Walker and Mr Dransfield were in
breach of their respective duties as directors of Rosamond under Section 232(2)
and 232(4)
of the Corporations Law.  The failure of Walker Consolidated to
secure the Thompson Option for Rosamond was in breach of the covenant
referred
to in paragraph 37 and in breach of the fiduciary obligations owed to Lakatoi
referred to in paragraphs 36(a) to (e) (inclusive).'</i>
<P>

22   	Yet another of the allegations to be found in the notice
of contention relates to a company known as Vamden Pty Limited.
<P>

23   	Paragraph 64 reads:
<P>

<i>`On or about 10 December 1995 Mr Walker and Mr Dransfield caused Vamden to
submit to the Wollongong City Council ("WCC") a development
application in
respect of the Thompson Land (the `Vamden Development Application").'</i>
<P>

24   	Paragraphs 67 and 68 of the notice of contentions then are
to the effect that it was the duty of Mr Walker and Mr Dransfield
as directors
of Rosamond to cause:
<P>

<i>`(a)	any development application for the Thompson Land which could be
beneficial to the achievement of the joint venture objectives
to be lodged and
pursued and, if development consent thereto be obtained, then to obtain such
development consent in the name of
Rosamond.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any material in which property rights did or may exist which could be
beneficial to the achievement of the joint venture objectives
to be obtained
for and be owned by Rosamond.'</i>
<P>

25   	The particulars given as to the duty are that it arose
under section 232(2) and (4) of the Corporations Law.  Paragraphs 68
and 69 of
the notice of contentions then plead:
<P>

<i>'68.	In lodging the Vamden Development Application and accepting the Vamden
Development Consent in the name of Vamden and for the
benefit of Vamden:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Mr Walker and Mr Dransfield acted in breach of the duties owed by them
as directors as alleged in the preceding paragraph;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Mr Walker acted in breach of the fiduciary duty he owed to Mr Hogarth
referred to in paragraph 29(a) to (e) (inclusive).</i>
<P>

<i>69.	The Vamden Development Consent is held by Vamden for the benefit of
Rosamond and the rights in and over the materials referred
to in paragraph 65
above are held by Vamden on trust for Rosamond.'</i>
<P>

26   	It is clearly inappropriate to repeat on this
interlocutory application in relation to a question going to  subpoenas, the
whole of the terms of the amended summons, nor to refer with any precision to
the latest amendments to that document.
<P>

27   	I turn to the subject matter of the particular subpoenas
the subject of this notice of motion.  Mr Ellicott has submitted
that by
reference to the evidence relied on by the plaintiffs on the motions, the
proposition has been made good that the plaintiffs
are entitled to inquire into
whether the beneficial ownership in shares in the company Balleroo, is in fact
held for Mr Walker.
<P>

28   	Mr Ellicott submits that the materials read in answer to
the notices of motion to set aside the subpoenas, should satisfy
the Court that
a number of transactions occurred which, on a close examination of each of the
transactions and of the suggested or
perceived relationships between the
transactions, would show that Balleroo was used by Mr Walker or by certain of
the defendants,
for the purpose of making profits which ought to have been
profits available to the shareholders in Walker Corporation.
<P>

29   	A number of steps were taken by Mr Ellicott, in
endeavouring to establish the interconnection of these alleged related
transactions.
 These steps are generally dealt with in the affidavits read by
Mr Ellicott in answer to the notices of motion and outlined in the
detailed
oral submissions.
<P>

30   	The submission was that the material now sought to be
tendered through use of the subject subpoenas are generally consistent
with the
actions of the relevant defendants thrown up for examination on the issues
pleaded such as the suggested use of Ibenmore
for political donations. The
submission is that the plaintiffs will seek to prove use by relevant defendants
of other bodies corporate
for the purpose of the defendants and not disclosed
to the plaintiffs.
<P>

31   	One aspect of one of those issues on which Mr Ellicott
opened, (the transcript will record the precise detail) related to
the issue of
security alarms. The submission was that these materials may show that relevant
defendants in substance acted in respect
of the matters the subject of these
subpoenas, in similar fashion to the manner in which the plaintiffs plead that
the defendants
acted on joint venture related transactions.
<P>

32   	Mr Shand submitted that the suggested wide ranging nature
of the inquiry sought to be engaged in by the plaintiffs ought not
be
permitted.  Mr Shand's submission is that the materials appear ex facie to be
totally irrelevant to the proceedings and would
represent a complete
distraction from the issues in the proceedings.  The submission is that, by
reason of the number of potential
issues sought to be addressed by the
plaintiffs as allegedly going to credit, the plaintiffs are engaging in conduct
which is oppressive.
<P>

33   	Mr Shand also referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 103(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act, 1995</a>, which  provides that the credibility rule does not apply to evidence
adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence has
substantial
probative value.
<P>

34   	Mr Shand also referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 2</a> of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s103.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 103</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, which provides that:
<P>

<i>"[W]ithout limiting the matters to which the Court may have regard in
deciding whether the evidence has substantial probative value,
it is to have
regard to:</i>
<P>

 <i>(a)	whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or
recklessly made a false representation when the witness was
under an obligation
to tell the truth, and</i>
<P>

<i>(b	the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the
evidence relates were done or occurred.</i>
<P>

35   	Mr Shand also draws attention to the definition in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i>dictionary of the words `probative value of evidence' which
means `the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment
of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue'.
<P>

36   	It need hardly be said that the present stage of these
proceedings is not the stage when the Court determines whether evidence
may be
tendered, at which stage, questions as to the application or terms of the
credibility rule would clearly be squarely in focus.
<P>

37   	Mr Shand also drew attention to so much of the judgment of
Rolfe J, at pages 30 to 32, as dealt with subpoenas relating to
Colgate
Palmolive Pty Ltd.  On those pages Rolfe J referred to the terms of the
documents sought to be produced on a subpoena and
added, `Prima facie, those
documents have nothing to do with the present proceedings.  There is no
reference to either Colgate Palmolive
Pty Ltd or Waterview Properties Pty Ltd
in the pleadings.  There is no suggestion that any of the defendants have any
interest in
or association with either company'.
<P>

38   	As Mr Ellicott said in argument, the last sentence of that
extract from Rolfe J's judgment is not apposite in terms of the
way the
plaintiffs presently seek access to the documents on subpoena. There is here a
suggestion that the defendants have an interest
in Balleroo.  It is that very
alleged interest in or association with Balleroo and the series of transactions
which Balleroo may,
on the plaintiffs' case, be shown to have entered into, and
the mode of use of Balleroo, which the plaintiffs seek to further investigate
to prove a course of conduct similar to that here pleaded.
<P>

39   	Having closely listened to the submissions on the
respective notices of motion and subpoenas and bearing in mind the way in
which
the plaintiffs in this case seek to make good the proposition that the credit
is to be in issue, and bearing in mind the way
the plaintiffs seek to press a
case centred upon the proposition that the relevant defendants engaged in  a
course of conduct involving
alleged serious legal wrong doing under a series of
causes of action including breaches of fiduciary obligation, I have come to the
conclusion that the plaintiffs ought to be permitted to have access to the
materials called for by the subject subpoenas and notices
to produce.
<P>

40   	In that regard the materials which have been before the
court to this point in time, will need to be identified by agreement,
if
possible, by counsel. 
<P>

41   	The motions filed by Balleroo, W. Duncan and P. Dovico to
set aside the subject subpoenas are dismissed. 
<P>

42   	I do not propose to deal with questions of costs on the
interlocutory application, being of the view that it will often occur
that
costs of interlocutory motions in a set of proceedings set down for an extended
period will go one way or another and that such
costs should generally be
reserved unless there are exceptional circumstances.
