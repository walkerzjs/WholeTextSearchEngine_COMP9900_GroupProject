<b>OBSERVATIONS AND ORDER:</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> 
<P>

1	     Application is made today, on no more than a few hours' notice, by the
plaintiff in terms of the Notice of Motion which is
now filed in court by
leave.
<P>

2	     I have seen the affidavit of Christopher Steven Frawley sworn today and
filed in court by the plaintiff.  Exhibit 1 is a
copy of a letter from Henry
Davis York to Paul Hetherington of 8 April 1999.  Interlocutory exhibit 2 is a
bundle formerly exhibit
CSF1.  I have also read three affidavits filed by the
defendant in court today; affidavits of Stuart William Hetherington sworn 8
April 1999; Anthony Geoffrey Hartnell sworn 9 April 1999 and Robert Arthur
Porter sworn 8 April 1999. I direct that the Notice to
Produce, defendant to
plaintiff, which was shown to me earlier be filed.
<P>

3	     The plaintiff's notice of motion makes a number of applications. First,
that Australian International Insurance Limited be
joined as second plaintiff.
This application is no longer contentious and the order will be made.
<P>

4	     The principal subject of the application is vacation of my appointment
for the trial of proceedings to take place on 3 May
next.   I made the order
for expedition on 19 February, not on the ground of the position of the
defendant who sought expedition,
but because the question whether he holds
office as a director of a public company is involved in the proceedings.
<P>

5	     The plaintiff in fact has claims of urgency for the proceedings to be
brought on for hearing but they are not so far out
of the ordinary urgency of
equity business as to persuade me that the proceedings ought to be expedited.
My concern is with what
I see as the public interest aspect of the
controversy.
<P>

6	     The evidence put forward today in my opinion shows that reasonable
endeavours have been made to prepare the case.  They have
not been successful
because of the scale and range of facts which are relevant and because there is
much information held by ASIC
including records and business documents produced
to ASIC by others and records of ASIC's own interviews.  It is apparent to me
that
it would not be prudent for the plaintiff's legal advisers to settle
affidavits or otherwise to go to trial without taking endeavours
to get
information held by ASIC as far as they can be taken.
<P>

7	     I appreciate that ASIC does not exist to facilitate  these litigants'
endeavours and does not labour for the purposes of
the conduct of this case,
but in fact ASIC is in possession of a body of information important to the
case and not readily available.
It seems possible that some administrative
procedures or litigation may be involved in obtaining information from ASIC.
<P>

8	     I have been told that the Statement of Claim is now ready to be filed.
It is much delayed, many weeks past the time which
I appointed, and I expect it
to be filed today or on Monday next.  I will endorse it with leave to file. The
addition of a plaintiff
does not seem likely to add much to the complexities of
the trial. The plaintiff's legal advisers now estimate the hearing time to
be
well in excess of five days.  I am in their hands as to estimates but on the
information and reasoning they put forward I see
no ground to doubt their
estimates. They are in a good position to make estimates, and they range from
ten to fifteen hearing days.
That time is not available in May 1999.
<P>

9	     Mr Porter has made his arrangements with his legal advisers on the basis
of my earlier appointment and says on affidavit
that he wishes to proceed. I
appreciate that the decision I am now making involves some inconvenience and
disruption to him. I am
of the view that as the facts stand the appointment can
not be maintained. The plaintiff's statement of claim shows that the case
is
more complex than I initially appreciated; it will be more difficult to prepare
and I expect it will require a longer hearing
time than I earlier
contemplated.
<P>

10	     I have a choice between directing that the matter come on for hearing
without allowing information to emerge fully from
ASIC and on the other hand
waiting for those endeavours to be fully tested.  As there is to be a delay it
should be long enough to
take things as far as they can be taken.  It does seem
that, if the case goes to trial when there is a large body of evidence but
it
is out of reach of the parties, it may later be said that  the plaintiff was
not given an opportunity to test witnesses, or that
for some reason there was a
procedural failure in a trial which took place in those circumstances.
<P>

11	     Although public interest concerns moved me to expedite proceedings on
16 February, I find now that it is not possible to
act in that way and I can do
no more than to ensure it is heard later this year, in the next five to six
months.  The application
for expedition was appropriate in the case of this
company, but what I then expected has proved not to be practical. I have to
make
a balance between the claim of this case for expedition and the claim of
other cases and I feel that I should do no more.
<P>

12	     I have given consideration to using the time in May to decide separate
questions, yet to be well defined, with the object
of settling the matter which
bears most closely on the public interest, that is, whether Mr Porter remained
a director of the company
after 27 November 1998 and whether he remained a
director after 1 April 1999. The defendant's counsel have shown me drafts of
proposed
separate questions  and of the relevant facts on which argument is to
be based. Before I decide to embark on the hearing of separate
questions I will
however give the parties a further opportunity to consider the contents of
these drafts or any other questions or
facts which are to be put forward.
<P>

13	     It is necessary before embarking on the hearing of a separate question
to have a well defined separate question, to know
what facts are to be examined
for its resolution and to have a well defined outcome , that is, a clearly
established order which
is to be made according to the answer given to the
separate question. Definition of those things requires a little time and
consideration,
and I will return to that consideration on Friday next, 16
April.
<P>

14	     I am particularly concerned whether disputed facts may have to be
determined if all questions relating to Mr Porter's continuing
to hold office
are to be decided.  I have in view the provisions of section 1322 of the
Corporations Law and particularly subsection
(2).  If decision requires an
address to the overall merits of his purported dismissal, or any other matter
substantially open to
dispute, I would be reluctant to embark on the hearing of
a separate question.  There should be one full address to the merits of
the
case and one only.
<P>

15	     I earlier gave directions fixing times for filing affidavits. In view
of the considerations I have just mentioned, I no
longer require the parties to
adhere to those directions and I will vacate them.
<P>

16	     The orders are:  I order that Australian International Insurance
Limited be second plaintiff in these proceedings. I vacate
the appointment for
hearing the proceedings on 3 May 1999 to continue on 4, 5, 6, and 7 May. I
direct that the statement of claim
be filed and served on or before Tuesday, 13
April 1999. I vacate directions fixing times for filing affidavits.   The
proceedings
be listed for directions on 16 April 1999 when I will consider:
<P>

1) Separate decision of questions.
<P>

2) Directions generally.
<P>

The defendant has leave to file a further amended cross-claim and I direct that
the cross-claim be filed with the defence. The costs
of the application today
are reserved.
<P>

     The exhibits are returned.
<P>

<center>*********</center>
<P>

I certify that paragraphs 1-16 are the reasons for
<P>

judgment of the Honourable Justice John Bryson.
<P>

Date:  9 April 1999.      (J. Stevenson)
<P>
