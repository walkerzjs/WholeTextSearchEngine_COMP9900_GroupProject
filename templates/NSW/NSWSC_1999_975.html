JUDGMENT (on question of client legal privilege)
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1   	Early in 1991 Neil Drabsch (`'Drabsch'') was employed by
Switzerland General Insurance Co limited (`'SGI'') as its Chief Executive
Officer (`'CEO'').  Prior to that time he had been the financial controller of
the company.  Whilst he was financial controller,
Michael McErlane
(`'McErlane'') was the CEO.  In July 1991, Drabsch was summarily dismissed by
SGI as its CEO.  He has brought proceedings
for wrongful dismissal.  SGI
pleaded justification of the wrongful dismissal and cross-sued Drabsch for
damages.  Both its defence
and the cross-claim were based on alleged misconduct
by Drabsch as an employee of SGI.  A great deal of the misconduct allegedly
took place whilst McErlane was still CEO.  To the defence Drabsch replied and
to the cross-claim he pleaded that many of his acts
alleged as misconduct vis a
vis SGI were specifically authorised by McErlane, then his superior.  On 24
November 1993 SGI brought
proceedings by way of cross-claim against McErlane
claiming damages in respect of losses which it allegedly suffered as a result
of acts of misconduct by Drabsch which were authorised by McErlane.  Before the
proceedings were commenced against McErlane, Drabsch's
solicitor, Mr Veitch,
took instructions from McErlane for a statement for use by Drabsch in the
proceedings.  Mr Veitch sent a copy
of the draft to McErlane. After expansion
the statement was approved by McErlane and signed by him on 27 August 1993
(`'the McErlane
statement'').  At that time McErlane was unaware that SGI
contemplated a claim against him.  Thereafter, a copy of the McErlane statement
came into McErlane's possession.  McErlane has no recollection of how it came
into his possession.  Mr Veitch has no recollection
of how it was conveyed to
McErlane, but did have a practice of sending to witnesses whom he had proofed
copies of their statements
after signature.  Although he has no recollection of
doing this, he believes that he sent McErlane a copy of the McErlane statement
after execution "for his reference as a potential witness in the proceedings."
On the evidence I find that the McErlane statement
came into McErlane's
possession by being forwarded to him by Mr Veitch shortly after 27 August 1993.
No copy of any letter forwarding
the statement is in evidence, nor is there
evidence of any other communication concerning that event.  Thereafter,
McErlane consulted
Mr Michael O'Dea of Carroll and O'Dea, Solicitors,
concerning his position.  He gave the McErlane statement or a copy of it to Mr
O'Dea.  Subsequently Mr O'Dea informed SGI's insurers under a Directors and
Officers Policy (`'D&amp;O Policy'') of a possible claim
upon them by McErlane.
In 1994 he furnished them with material concerning this.  That material
included a copy of the McErlane statement.
 In 1997, Drabsch and McErlane each
instituted separate proceedings against the underwriters claiming indemnity
under the D&amp;O
Policy.  Those insurers in the course of the conduct of those
proceedings discovered the McErlane statement and afforded inspection
of it.
It thereby came into the possession of SGI.  SGI now seeks to put portions of
the McErlane statement into evidence by cross
examination of McErlane.  Drabsch
objects to this course on the ground that it is precluded by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 119</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (`'the Act''). 
<P>

2   	The principally relevant provisions of the Act are as
follows:
<P>

`'117(1)  In this Division ...
<P>

"confidential communication" means a communication made in such circumstances
that, when it was made:
<P>

(a)	the person who made it, or
<P>

(b)	the person to whom it was made, was under an express or implied obligation
not to disclose its contents, whether or not the
obligation arises under
law;
<P>

"confidential document" means a document prepared in such circumstances that,
when it was prepared:
<P>

(a)	the person who prepared it, or
<P>

(b)	the person for whom it was prepared, was under an express or implied
obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not
the obligation arises
under law ...
<P>

119  Litigation
<P>

Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds
that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure
of:
<P>

(a)	a confidential communication between the client and another person, or
between a lawyer acting for the client and another person,
that was made, or
<P>

(b)	the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) that was
prepared, for the dominant purpose of the client
being provided with
professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding
(including the proceeding before
the court ), or an anticipated or pending
Australian or overseas proceeding , in which the client is or may be, or was or
might have
been, a party.
<P>

122  Loss of client legal privilege: consent and related matters
<P>

(1)	This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence given with the
consent of the client or party concerned.
<P>

(2)	Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of
evidence if a client or party has knowingly and voluntarily
disclosed to
another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not
made:
<P>

(a)	in the course of making a confidential communication or preparing a
confidential document , or
<P>

(b)	as a result of duress or deception, or
<P>

(c)	under compulsion of law , or
<P>

(d)	if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding an
office under, an Australian law - to the Minister, or
the Minister of the
Commonwealth, the State or Territory, administering the law, or the part of the
law , under which the body is
established or the office is held.
<P>

(3)	Subsection (2) does not apply to a disclosure by a person who was, at the
time, an employee or agent of a client or party or
of a lawyer unless the
employee or agent was authorised to make the disclosure.
<P>

(4)	Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of
evidence if the substance of the evidence has been
disclosed with the express
or implied consent of the client or party to another person other than:
<P>

(a)	a lawyer acting for the client or party , or
<P>

(b)	if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding an
office under, an Australian law - the Minister, or the
Minister of the
Commonwealth, the State or Territory, administering the law , or the part of
the law, under which the body is established
or the office is held.
<P>

(5)	Subsections (2) and (4) do not apply to:
<P>

(a)	a disclosure by a client to another person if the disclosure concerns a
matter in relation to which the same lawyer is providing,
or is to provide,
professional legal services to both the client and the other person, or
<P>

(b)	a disclosure to a person with whom the client or party had, at the time of
the disclosure, a common interest relating to a proceeding
or an anticipated or
pending proceeding in an Australian court or a foreign court .
<P>

(6)	This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a document that
a witness has used to try to revive the witness's
memory about a fact or
opinion or has used as mentioned in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32</a> (Attempts to revive memory in
court) or 33 (Evidence by police officers).''
<P>

3   	There is no doubt that at one time privilege attached to
the McErlane statement in Drabsch's favour.  The question is whether
that
privilege has been lost so as now to permit the proposed use of the McErlane
statement.
<P>

4   	Mr Marshall, of counsel for SGI, contends that the
privilege has been lost by reason of one or more of the following events:
<P>

(a)	the provision by Drabsch's solicitor (Mr Veitch) of the statement to
McErlane;
<P>

(b)	the provision of the statement by McErlane's former solicitor, Mr O'Dea, to
Phillips Fox, the solicitors for the D &amp; O insurance
underwriters;
<P>

(c)	the discovery of the statement by the insurance underwriters in proceedings
2324/97, the unfettered inspection of the statement
and the taking of a copy
during the inspection phase of discovery; and
<P>

(d)	the production of the statement by the insurance underwriters during the
trial and the provision of access to SGI in Court without
a claim being made
for privilege.
<P>

5   	So far as contention (a) is concerned, Mr Marshall relies
on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <b>Newcastle Wallsend Coal Co Pty Ltd
v Court of Coal Mines Regulation </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 351.</a>  The circumstances in
this case seem to me very similar to those considered by the Court of Appeal.
There a coal company threatened
with proceedings had a solicitor, Mr Hickey,
conduct a record of interview with a potential witness, MacLean.  A draft was
forwarded
to MacLean for correction.  At that time he was told that it was
forwarded to him on a confidential basis.  He made a few minor alterations
and
signed it.  He returned it signed without keeping a copy.  Subsequently he
asked if he could have a copy and it was sent to him
in an envelope marked
`'private and confidential''.  There was no evidence of any other communication
to him at the time this copy
was sent.  Powell JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed)
said (at 389):
<P>

`'It does not, however, follow that the records of interview prepared by Mr
Hickey are not privileged from production. On the contrary,
so it seems to me,
each of those records of interview was a "confidential document" for the
purposes of Div 1 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3.10</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, which was prepared for
the dominant purpose of the coal company "being provided with professional
legal services relating to (a)
... proceeding ... or (an) anticipated or
pending ... proceeding, in which the (coal company) ... was or might have been
a party".
This being so, each of those records of interview was, in my opinion,
privileged from disclosure unless, relevantly, that privilege
had been lost by
reason of a knowing and voluntary disclosure by the coal company or its
representatives, in the circumstances provided
for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act
1995</a>.
<P>

With respect to those who may be of another view, it seems to me that the mere
fact that each record of interview was sent to the
person interviewed, or his
legal personal representative, solely for the purpose of being checked and, if
need, be corrected and
then returned to Mr Hickey, the person interviewed, or
his legal personal representative, not being entitled to retain a copy of
the
record of interview, does not amount to a knowing and voluntary disclosure for
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>. It follows, in my view,
that, but for the matters to which I will next refer, each of the records of
interview prepared by Mr Hickey
was and remains privileged from disclosure.
<P>

However, as the coal company, in no longer prosecuting its claim for privilege
in respect of the record of the interview with Mr
MacLean seems to recognise,
the privilege which formerly attached to that record of interview has been lost
by reason of the facts:
<P>

(1) that the copy of that record of interview which was later provided to Mr
MacLean was provided to him for his own purposes and
was not made subject to
any condition as to non-disclosure ... `'
<P>

6   	Mr Shand, of Queen's Counsel for Drabsch, objects that the
document is a confidential document, being a witness statement,
and that it
does not lose its confidentiality by being handed to the witness:  "in order to
lose the privilege there must be a positive
licence or permission given to ...
the prospective witness, to do what he likes with it."  Perhaps another way of
putting it is that
the communication back to the witness of the document is
parallel with his original undoubtedly confidential communication of the
material to the solicitor, is therefore itself a confidential communication,
and cannot be taken as an implied consent to further
communication.  Mr Shand
spoke in terms of the common law concept of waiver.  He sought to distinguish
the <b>Newcastle Wallsend </b>case on the basis that there the witness's
statement "was particularly provided to him for his own purposes."  Mr Shand
also sought
to bring the matter within the "common interest" exception in sub s
(5), but I found it difficult to understand the common interest
he sought to
rely on.  
<P>

7   	The first thing to be said is that any suggestion that
these provisions of the Act should be construed by reference to the
common law
should be rejected, as it was rejected by the High Court in relation to the
hearsay provisions of the Act in <b>Papakosmas v The Queen </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 37.</a>
The Act lays down a detailed regime as to privilege; those provisions should be
applied according to their terms and their construction
should not be governed
by the pre existing common law principles.  Secondly, I cannot see, on an
examination of the report of the
<b>Newcastle Wallsend </b>case that the facts
were significantly different from this case.  Nor can I see the basis for the
assertion that the statement was
in that case "particularly provided" to the
witness for his own purposes.  Thirdly, the appropriate questions to be asked,
as they
arise from the terms of the statute, are whether Drabsch knowingly and
voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the
evidence and
whether that disclosure was made in the course of making a confidential
communication, being a communication made in
such circumstances that when it
was made the person who made it or the person to whom it was made was under an
express or implied
obligation not to disclose its contents.  
<P>

8   	In my view, privilege does not attach to the McErlane
statement because the communication from Drabsch's solicitor to McErlane
of the
statement was made knowingly and voluntarily and not in the course of making a
confidential communication.  The matter seems
to me really to be on all fours
with the decision of the Court of Appeal in the <b>Newcastle Wallsend
</b>case<b>.  </b>Furthermore, the decision of the Court of Appeal in
<b>Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/97.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 97</a> and particularly
what was said by Giles JA at [27] - [29] seems to confirm that the delivery of
the statement could not be characterised
as a confidential communication.  In
any event, there being no evidence but that the statement was sent to McErlane
without comment
and with no restriction imposed on his use of it, it seems to
me that the circumstances were not such as to impose an obligation
of
confidentiality on him.  In my opinion, it was a statement made by him, it was
given to him without comment, and there was nothing
in the circumstances that
precluded him from giving it to anyone else as his version of the facts if he
chose.  If I am correct in
this, that concludes the matter.  
<P>

9   	Accordingly, I do not need to determine contention (b).
However, I shall add that, in relation to the communication by Mr O'Dea
to the
underwriters' solicitors, the question that arises under the Act is whether the
substance of the evidence has been disclosed
with the express or implied
consent of the client to another person. Mr Shand submitted that the
confidentiality of the witness statement
persisted when McErlane handed the
statement to Mr O'Dea, "who has no authority at all to rob Mr Drabsch of his
privilege," and was
not authorised by Drabsch to convey the statement to the
underwriters.  However, it follows from what I have said above as to the
lack
of restriction placed on the use of the statement when sent to him and
McErlane's freedom to use it as he chose that, when Mr
O'Dea as his agent
conveyed it to the underwriters, that was done with Drabsch's implied consent
and would have destroyed privilege
if it still existed.
<P>

10   	In my view, sub s (5) would not in either case (a) or (b)
of the communication of the McErlane statement prevent the operation
of sub s
(2) or (4).  In the case of the disclosure to McErlane, there were at the time
actual proceedings against Drabsch, but no
actual or anticipated proceedings
against McErlane; McErlane could not at that time be regarded as having a
common interest with
Drabsch in the proceedings against the latter.  In the
case of the communication to the underwriters, there was no proceeding (actual
or anticipated) in which Drabsch had a common interest with them.
<P>

11   	I have some doubts as to whether privilege, if it still
existed, would have been given away by the matters relied on by Mr
Marshall in
contentions (c) and (d) of his submissions.  However, it is not necessary for
me to decide that.
<P>

12   	In short, in my opinion, privilege has ceased to attach to
the McErlane statement and s 119 of the Act does not prohibit it
being put into
evidence, and I so rule.
