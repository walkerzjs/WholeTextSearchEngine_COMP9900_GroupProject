<P>

<b>Judgment (Justification &amp; comment - qualified privilege - at common law
only - sufficiency of particulars - ambit of interrogatories)</b>
<P>

1   	This matter is listed for trial on 31 January 2000. 
<P>

2   	The first application by the plaintiff is pursuant to a
Notice of Motion filed on 14 October 1999 in which he seeks to have
struck out
the particulars of the defence of truth.
<P>

3   	I delivered a judgment on the same subject matter on 20
August 1999 ([1999] NSWSC 838).
<P>

4   	Consequent to that judgment (which also struck out a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a>
defence), the defendant, on 22 October 1999, by consent, filed in Court an
Amended Defence to a Further Amended Statement of Claim.
 There had been filed
in Court on 24 September 1999 a "<i>Consolidated Statement of
Particulars</i>".
<P>

5   	With respect to the Consolidated Statement of Particulars
of the defence of justification, I am easily persuaded by the contents
of the
document that the defence adequately has been particularised.  Much of the
argument with which I was concerned on 19 November
was really focused upon
suggestions as to the inadequacy of particulars by reason of information in the
hands of the plaintiff. 
Those submissions pointed to issues to be litigated at
the trial on the question of whether or not the defendant has made out a case
of substantial truth.  When one reads the document and asks the question
"<i>has the defendant made known its case to the plaintiff?"</i> the answer
must be in the affirmative.  Standing alone the defendant's particulars are, in
my view, now adequate.  The plaintiff
has the further advantage of having heard
argument in support of the particulars by reference to matters of evidence and
I do not
consider that he can legitimately contend that the defendant has
failed to make his case known.  No basis for striking out the particulars
has
been established.
<P>

6   	The defendant has pleaded qualified privilege.  It is
important to note that the defendant in this regard does not rely upon
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i>.  He pleads qualified privilege on two bases at
common law:  first, founded in the traditional sense of reciprocity of duty and
interest;
 secondly, founded further in the traditional available basis,
namely, in response to an attack.  This is made clear from the Consolidated
Statement of Particulars referrable to that defence.  
<P>

7   	The plaintiff complains that the defendant has improperly
failed to answer, interrogatories directed essentially to the defendant's
state
of mind.  The defendant has taken an objection that such interrogatories are
vexatious and oppressive and do not relate to
any matter in issue between the
parties, stating expressly that the defendant has not pleaded any defence under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a>.  </i>
<P>

8   	The interrogatories are in standard form.  It is said that
it is legitimate for the plaintiff to interrogate the defendant
as to
information in his possession and on which he acted at the time of publication
and the inquiries (if any), made by him in order
to ascertain the truth of that
material.  In support of this submission reliance is placed upon what the
learned editors of <i>Tobin &amp; Sexton</i> state in paragraph 25.260 of their
text of "<i>Australian Defamation Law &amp; Practice</i>".  The authors state
that the obvious basis of relevance of the question is the issue of malice on
the part of the defendant, on
the ground that the answer may tend to establish
malice on the part of the defendant.  The plaintiff is entitled to ask whether
the
defendant intended to convey the meanings pleaded by the plaintiff.  The
last part of this statement is not material because the
defendant has answered
those interrogatories because it is relevant to the defence of comment.
<P>

9   	In support of the first part of the proposition the learned
authors rely upon two decisions of the Court of Appeal in England.
 The first
is <b><i>White &amp; Co v Credit Reform Association &amp; Credit Index Limited
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%201%20KB%20653" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] 1 KB 653.</a>  The defendants in that case were interrogated as to
what inquiries they made as to the truth of statements complained of before
publishing them and from whom they obtained the information on which they
relied in publishing the relevant material.  Such an interrogatory
was held to
be admissible.  It is to be noted however that upon reading the report it is
exposed that the defendants by their statement
of defence (inter alia), pleaded
that they published the matter complained of in good faith without malice.
Further, the defendants
had administered to the plaintiff an interrogatory
asking whether it alleged that the defendants, in publishing the statements
complained
of, were actuated by malice towards it, and, if so, upon what facts
and circumstances they relied as showing actual malice.  The
plaintiff had in
fact answered that interrogatory to the effect that it did allege that the
defendants made no proper inquiries and
were possessed of no information or
particulars and so on.  The structure of the defendant's plea was referred to
expressly by Collins
MR at 657.  With respect to the learned authors I do not
see that case as providing authority for the very broad statement in the
first
sentence of the paragraph under consideration.  
<P>

10   	The authors also refer to the Court of Appeal's decision
in <b><i>Edmondson v Birch &amp; Co Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%202%20KB%20523" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] 2 KB 523.</a>  In that
instance I gather that the Court of Appeal, being of the opinion from
correspondence which had passed between the parties
that the interrogatory as
framed was not put bona fide but for an ulterior motive, disallowed the
interrogatory as to the information
the defendants received "<i>which induced
them to make the statement complained of</i>".  The submissions advanced by so
eminent a counsel as Marshall Hall KC that there was an entitlement in the
plaintiff to administer
such an interrogatory even if there be an incidental
result of the disclosure of the defendant's informant, was unsuccessful.  The
interrogatory I gather would otherwise have been allowed to "<i>permit evidence
of malice</i>" per Mathew L J at 527 provided it was not otherwise an
"<i>engine of great oppression</i>", per Romer L J at 526.  There decisions
(and the general statement in the text) can here have no application.  (Compare
<b><i>Makim v Nationwide News Pty Limited</i></b> Hunt J, unreported, 2 March
1990).
<P>

11   	The pleading of the common law defence of privilege is in
very brief form in the Amended Defence to the Further Amended Statement
of
Claim but is well amplified in the Consolidated Statement of Particulars.
Nothing there is exposed that would warrant the answering
the interrogatories.
The interrogatories do go to subjective matters, the defences as pleaded and
particularised, as I read them,
are founded on objective matters.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff's Reply was filed on 21 May 1997.  It is
alleged that the defendant was "<i>actuated by express malice</i>":  that is
the material allegation made in this pleading (see SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p67" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 67</a> r 19).  The first
particular is that the defendant "<i>bore ill will and hostility toward the
plaintiff"</i>.  Thereafter there are set out 10 sub-particulars the first of
which is fundamentally objective material or material reflective of
the
plaintiff's state of mind.  There are some allegations, for example,
sub-particular (viii) that the defendant "<i>knew</i>" certain things and (ix)
the plaintiff "<i>warned</i>" the defendant.  None of the interrogatories
administered is sufficiently focused on these matters purporting to go to the
question
of malice in defeasance of the plea of qualified privilege to warrant
an order that they be answered.  Particular (b) merely asserts
"<i>improper
motive being an intent to injure the plaintiff"</i>, that, it is said, is
clarified by reference to the <i>"manner of presentation which was excessive
and unfair</i>".  No interrogatory has been delivered in relation to that
matter.
<P>

13   	Sub-paragraph (d) asserts "<i>reckless indifference of the
defendant to the truth or falsity"</i> of the imputations.  That is a sweeping
statement in a Reply that is quite often seen but it is not particularised.  I
am not of
the opinion that such a generalised allegation in a particular in a
Reply warrants an order that the defendant answer generalised
interrogatories.

<P>

14   	Accordingly, the defendant will not be required further to
answer interrogatories.
<P>

15   	Pursuant to my judgment of 20 August 1999 particulars of
the defence of comment have been provided and I am satisfied that
they are
proper in form and state the defendant's case on that issue.
<P>

16   	As far as I presently understand the situation there are
still outstanding matters:  a question of whether the defendant's
discovery is
sufficient (apparently based on the absence of some documents referred to as
annexures to discovered documents);  questions
of a subpoena addressed to the
Victims Compensation Tribunal which can be independently dealt with;  the
capacity of the matter complained
of to bear the contextual imputations in the
Amended Defence to the Further Amended Statement of Claim;  the question of the
reconsideration
of my judgment on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a></i> handed down on 20 August 1999.  These will be dealt with at an
appropriate time.
<P>

17   	I refuse orders 1, 2, 3 and 4 (taking into account the
notional later dates that would have to be referred to therein) in
the Notice
of Motion.  The balance of the Motion is stood over to a date to be fixed and
costs are reserved.
