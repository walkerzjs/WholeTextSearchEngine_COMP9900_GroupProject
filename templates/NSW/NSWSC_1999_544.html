<P>

<b>AUSTRALIA LIMITED  v  </b>
<P>

<b>TIMOTHY JOHN BRADLEY &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>		</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Strike out defence;  Summary judgment)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 3 May 1999, the
plaintiff seeks that pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> r 26 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>
(the Rules) the defence or amended defence be struck out or that pursuant to
Part 13 r 2 of the Rules, summary judgment be entered
and that expedition be
granted.  The plaintiff relied on an affidavit of Brett Russell Ingle-Olson
sworn 28 April 1999.  The defendant
did not rely on any affidavit evidence and
opposed the orders sought.
<P>

2  	Mr Timothy John Bradley is the first defendant and Irene Alexis
Bradley is the second defendant.  The defendants are the registered
proprietors
of a property known as "Melross" Moss Vale Road, Kangaroo Valley (the
property).  On 15 July 1994 the defendants executed
a mortgage (the mortgage)
over the property in favour of the plaintiff to secure advances made by the
plaintiff from time to time
to them.  Financial accommodation in the form of a
term loan (the account) was provided to the defendants between 15 July 1994 and
20 August 1998.  Paragraph (5) of the statement of claim asserts that pursuant
to paragraph (7) of the memorandum of mortgage the
defendants in default of the
due payment of money owing or payable as demanded and the plaintiff was
entitled to exercise its right
under the mortgage.  
<P>

3  	The plaintiff issued a s 57(2)(b) notice pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a></b> 1900 (NSW) dated 20 August 1998.  The plaintiff pleads that
the defendants have failed and neglected to pay the amount claimed in
the
demand and seeks possession of the property and judgment in the sum of
$863,761.73 plus interest.
<P>

4  	The parties attended a Farm Debt Mediation.  They entered into an
agreement dated 30 April 1997.  The relevant covenants contained
in the
agreement (FDMA) are as follows:
<P>

<b>"1.	Repayments of $6,400 pm and $4,800 pm to be met.  Next instalment is to
be met by the first Wednesday of June 1997 and by June
2009;  the amount
outstanding together with any interest and charges thereon is to be met.</b>
<P>

<b>2.	Interest rate is to be set at 12% pa until August 1998 at which time the
rate is to be set for a further 12 months on 24 months
at the rate applicable
for performing loans.</b>
<P>

<b>3.	No prepayment fee is to apply to the loan up to and including August
1998.</b>
<P>

<b>4.	Should borrowers be unable to meet repayment in any month then a further
one month is to be allowed to rectify the situation.</b>
<P>

<b>5.	Should the account not be in order after the further month has been
allowed then assets are to be sold <u>to bring account into order</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>6.	The borrower can elect to met payments on a weekly basis.</b>
<P>

<b>7.	Should borrower elect to provide weekly payments then the weekly amount
is to be calculated as being the total monthly repayments
per annum divided by
the weeks per year.  The Bank will accept this as meeting the repayments set
out in 1, above.</b>
<P>

<b>8.	If settlement of Lot 142 is not effected by 30 June 1997 repayments are
to be reviewed with view to clearance of the debt over
the remaining period of
the loans.</b>
<P>

<b>9.	Prepayment fees is only applicable after August 1998 should borrowers
provide more than amount equal to 12 months repayments in
advance."</b>
<P>

5  	It is common ground that if the parties are in default of the
agreement then the mortgage provisions apply.  
<P>

6  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> r 26 of the Rules provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Where a pleading -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the pleading;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings, or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the
whole or any part of the pleadings be struck out.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an
order under subrule (1)."</b>
<P>

7  	The relevant parts of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 13</a> r 2 says:
<P>

<b>"2(1)	Where, on application by the plaintiff in relation to any claim for
relief or any part of any claim for relief of the plaintiff
-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	there is evidence of the facts on which the claim or part is based;
and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	there is evidence given by the plaintiff or by some responsible person
that, in the belief of the person giving the evidence,
the defendant has no
defence to the claim or part, or no defence except as to the amount of any
damages claimed,</b>
<P>

<b>the Court may, by order, on terms, give such judgment for the plaintiff on
that claim or part as the nature of the case requires.</b>
<P>

8  	In a recent decision in <b><u>Air Services Australia v
Zarb</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 26 August 1998) Rolfe AJA found it useful to
remind himself of the highly demanding test imposed on a party seeking
summary
judgment.  His Honour referred to <b><u>Dey v Victorian Railway </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Commissioners</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%2d49%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948-49) 78 CLR 62</a>, <b><u>General Steel Industries

passages quoted.
<P>

9  	In <b><u>Dey</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%2d1949%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948-1949) 78 CLR 62</a> Dixon J stated at p
91:
<P>

<b>"The application is really made to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to
stop the abuse of its process when it is employed for
groundless claims.  The
principles upon which that jurisdiction is exercisable are well settled. A case
must be very clear indeed
to justify the summary intervention of the Court to
prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination in the appointed
manner
by the Court with or without a jury.  The fact that a transaction is
intricate may not disentitle the Court to examine a cause of
action alleged to
grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceedings amounts to an
abuse of process or is vexatious.
 But once it appears that there is a real
question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the
parties depend
upon it, then it is not competent for the Court to dismiss the
action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process."</b>
<P>

10  	After considering that proposition further his Honour said, at p
92:
<P>

<b>"It is in my opinion of more importance to maintain the integrity of the
principle that under cover of the inherent jurisdiction to
stop abuse of
process litigants are not to be deprived of the right to submit real and
genuine controversies to the determination
of the courts by the due procedure
appropriate for the purpose than for this Court to add another to the many
judicial attempts that
have been made to construe and apply the perplexing
provisions that stand in Victoria as s 5(2)(b) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/wca1928255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act
1928</a>."</b>
<P>

11  	In <b><u>General Steel</u></b> Barwick CJ, who heard the
application alone, referred to Dixon J's passage quoted above at p 130.  He
then stated:
<P>

<b>"Although I can agree with Latham CJ in the same case when he said that the
defendant should be saved from the vexation of the continuance
of useless and
futile proceedings, in my opinion great care must be exercised to ensure that
under the guise of achieving expeditious
finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed
tribunal.  On the other
hand I do not think that the exercise of the
jurisdiction should be reserved for those cases where argument is unnecessary
to evoke
the futility of the plaintiff's claim.  Argument, perhaps even of an
extensive kind, may be necessary to demonstrate that the case
of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed."</b>
<P>

12  	Barwick CJ also said:
<P>

<b>"It is sufficient for me to say that these cases uniformly adhere to the
view that the plaintiff ought not to be denied access to
the customary tribunal
which deals with actions of the kind he brings, unless his lack of cause of
action - if that be the ground
on which the Court is invited, as in this case,
to exercise its powers of summary dismissal - is clearly demonstrated.  The
test
to be applied has been variously expressed;  `so obviously untenable that
it cannot possibly succeed';  `manifestly groundless';
 `so manifestly faulty
that it does not admit of argument';  `discloses a case which the Court is
satisfied cannot succeed';  `under
no possibility can there be a good cause of
action';  `be manifest that to allow them' (the pleadings) `to stand would
involve useless
expense'."</b>
<P>

13  	More recently in <b><u>Webster</u></b><u> </u>Mason CJ, Deane
and Dawson JJ reinforced the rigorous testing stating, at p 602:
<P>

<b>"The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with `exceptional
caution' and `should never be exercised unless it is clear
that there is no
real question to be tried'."</b>
<P>

14  	According to Rolfe AJA in <b><u>Zarb</u></b>:
<P>

<b>"The demanding nature of the test is in no way lessened in circumstances
where there are the potential for difficult factual and legal
issues to arise.
Rather, as the decision in Webster made clear, it is heightened:  see also
Wickstead &amp; Ors v Browne  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1</a> and Esanda Finance Corporation
Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241."</a></b>
<P>

15  	Rolfe AJA continued:
<P>

<b>"In Wickstead Kirby P set forth five reasons for not dismissing part of the
proceedings at the stage he was considering the matter.
 The third, fourth and
fifth reasons all involved a consideration of the changes taking place in the
law and the relevance of that
to such an application.</b>
<P>

<b>In NRMA Insurance Limited v A.W. Edwards (Court of Appeal, unreported, 11
November 1994) his Honour, with whom Powell JA agreed, in
repeating the test to
be applied said, at p 7:</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>`Nevertheless, the more complex and arguable is the legal point, and the
more dependent it may seem to be upon debatable factual premises,
the less
likely it is that the peremptory relief sought by a party will be appropriate
to the circumstances of the case, particularly
where it would lead to the
consequence of terminating proceedings altogether, or terminating them forever
against one party.'</b>
<P>

<b>He then pointed out that:</b>
<P>

<b>`Unless the remedy is effectively confined to cases `for protecting a
defendant from vexation by the continuance of proceedings which
must be useless
and futile', it would have the consequence of substituting summary judicial
impression for determination on the merits,
having heard both evidence and
argument in the normal way of our courts'."</b>
<P>

16  	The plaintiff submitted that the validity of the purported s
57(2)(b) notice is irrelevant and that such notice can be treated
as a notice
of demand.  The plaintiff submitted that in any event it did not have to serve
a notice of demand because of the provisions
of clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the
mortgage.  According to the plaintiff cl 7.2 entitled the mortgagee's a right
to immediate payment
without any demand or notice (except as required by any
statutory provision which cannot be excluded) if any of the events listed
in cl
7.1 occur and default in payment is one of those events.
<P>

17  	The defendants submitted that it was necessary to issue a s
57(2)(b) notice and that the notice was invalid.  This allegation
has been
pleaded in the defence.  The defendants relied on the authority of
<b><u>Websdale &amp; Ors v S &amp; J D Investments Pty Limited &amp;
Ors</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281891%29%2024%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1891) 24 NSWLR 573.</a>  However in <b><u>Websdale</u></b> the
appellants were exercising their power of sale (see Clarke JA at p 576B).  His
Honour said that the power of a mortgagee to sell
the mortgage property where
that property is registered under the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b> 1900</A> (NSW), is
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 58(1)</a> which applies only where the mortgagee is authorised by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
57(2)</a> to exercise that power.  
<P>

18  	The plaintiff bank in the case before me is seeking possession.
It is not seeking to exercise its power of sale.  The plaintiff
referred to
<b><u>Westpac Banking Corporation v Comanos</u></b> (NSWSC, Giles J unreported,
9 May 1991).  At p 6 His Honour stated:
<P>

<b>"...there is a wealth of authority that service of a notice pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
57(2)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> is not a prerequisite to a mortgagee
obtaining possession but a sale by mortgagee."</b>
<P>

19  	Giles J cited the following authorities:  <b><u>Mercantile
Holdings Limited v Fisher</u></b> (NSWSC, Yeldham J, 19 November 1982,

1989, unreported);  and <b><u>Moreland Finance Corporation Limited v
Turner</u></b> (NSWSC, Newman J, 1 June 1990, unreported).
<P>

20  	It is my view that the service of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2)(b)</a> notice upon the
defendants is not a pre-requisite to a mortgagee obtaining possession.
Accordingly the parts of the defence relating
to the validity of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2)(b)</a>
notice cannot be maintained and should be struck out.
<P>

21  	The plaintiff submitted that it could appropriate payments to
the account in the manner it saw fit.  By letter of 28 August
1998, the
plaintiff informed the first defendant that his cheque in the sum of $11,200
had been received that day and applied to
the August 1998 loan repayment making
it paid in full.  This occurred at a time when there were existing arrears in
the July payments.
 The letter further stated that the plaintiff applied a New
South Wales Dairy Corporation cheque for $3,577.60 received on 13 August
1998
towards the July 1998 arrears of $8,910.  The result of these appropriations
was that the July 1998 repayment was still in arrears
by $5,332.40 yet the
August payment had been made in full.  The letter concluded that in accordance
with the FDMA as arrears had
not been paid within the stipulated time frame,
assets must now be sold to repay the loan.
<P>

22  	The plaintiff submitted that where there is a debt the debtor
has the primary right to appropriate any payments to make some
reduction of the
debt but if he does not appropriate the creditor has the right to appropriate.
According to the plaintiff the defendant/debtor
did not specify that the sums
of $11,200 and $3,577.60 were to be appropriated to the July arrears and
therefore the creditor had
the right to appropriate those amounts in the manner
which it saw fit.  In other words, the plaintiff was entitled to appropriate
payments received in August towards the August arrears rather than towards the
July repayment.
<P>

23  	However, the defendants submitted that paragraph (4) of the FDMA
created a special condition attaching to the deposit and that
moneys received
in August should have been appropriated to the July repayment.  Had the
plaintiff adopted that course it would not
have been entitled to issue the
notice of demand on 20 August 1998 because paragraph (4) of the FDMA stipulated
that should the borrower
be unable to meet a repayment in any month then a
further month was to be allowed to rectify the situation.  The plaintiff should
not have issued the notice of demand until September 1998.  This proposition is
in my view is arguable.
<P>

24  	Further, a bank officer has made calculations in a payment
summary (Ex BR108) which shows that as at March 1999 the defendants
were in
arrears in the sum of $65,462.88.  These calculations ignore a payment of
$110,550.32 made by the defendants to loan account
No 20303404/2 on 24 March
1999.  The defendants also have provided a table of payments which shows that
if this amount was paid off
the arrears, as at March 1999  then the account is
in credit in the sum of $45,087.44. 
<P>

25  	The plaintiff has not provided any evidence to show whether the
sum of $110,550.32 were loan repayments or a payment which
reflects the
settlement of Lot 142 - see paragraph (8) of the FDMA.  It is my view that it
is arguable that the defendants are not
in default of the agreement.  It is my
view that the plaintiff has failed to discharge its onus as I am not satisfied
that the defendants
case is hopeless and should be dismissed.  I decline to
strike out the balance of the defence and I also refuse to order that summary
judgment be entered.  
<P>

26  	In relation to the order seeking expedition, the plaintiff has
not produced any evidence to show the current value of the property.
 The
amount (if the plaintiff's calculations are accepted) due and owing under the
mortgage was $863,761.73 as at 30 October 1998.
 It is not known how much
equity there is in the property.  The plaintiff has failed to demonstrate there
is urgency in having this
matter determined.  It has not made out a case for
expedition so I decline to so order.
<P>

27  	The plaintiff has had only limited success in its endeavour to
strike out the defence and obtain summary judgment.  It would
seem that the
matter could have been placed in the holding list and obtained a trial date in
the near future.  Nevertheless, the
plaintiff elected to pursue its application
for summary judgment at this late stage.  In these circumstances it is my view
that the
appropriate order for costs is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

28  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The paragraphs of the defence that relate to the validity of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57(2)(b)</a>
notice should be struck out.
<P>

(2)	The defendants are to file an amended defence within 14 days.
<P>

(3)	The balance of the plaintiff's notice of motion filed 3 May 1999 is
dismissed.
<P>

(4)	Costs be costs in the cause.
<P>
