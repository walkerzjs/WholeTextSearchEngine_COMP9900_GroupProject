<b><u>11341/98 - THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v JOHN
FAIRFAX PUBLICATIONS PTY LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  By its summons filed on 28 May 1998 the plaintiff, the
Attorney General for the State of New South Wales, claims against the
defendant,
John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited, orders including the
following -
<P>

1.	A declaration that the Defendant is guilty of contempt of court in that,
being the publisher of :The Sydney Morning Herald" newspaper
it published in
that newspaper on 27 October 1997 matter which was likely or had a tendency to
interfere with the administration
of justice in connection with the trial in
the District Court, Sydney of Duong Van Ia on charges of supplying 223 grams of
heroin
and with being knowingly concerned in the supply of 222 grams of
heroin.
<P>

2.	An order that the Defendant be punished or otherwise dealt with for such
contempt of court.
<P>

<b>The charge</b>
<P>

2	As part of the Statement of Charge the plaintiff sets forth the following
particulars -
<P>

1.	On 13 August 1993 Duong Van Ia was arrested and charged with supply of a
prohibited drug, namely heroin; and being knowlingly
concerned in the supply of
a prohibited drug, namely heroin.  He was committed for trial on 29 April 1994.
As at 27 October 1997
the trial was listed to commence in the District Court at
Sydney on 23 March 1998.
<P>

2.	The Defendant was the publisher of "The Sydney Morning Herald" newspaper on
27 October 1997 ("the newspaper").  The newspaper
had a substantial circulation
in the Sydney jury district.
<P>

3.	The Defendant published in the newspaper material in relation to Duong Van
Ia.
<P>

4.	On page one of the newspaper the following material was published:
<P>

	(i)	Above a photograph of Duong Van Ia and another man Duncan Lam appeared the
words:
<P>

		"These two men have carved out a giant portion of Australia's $3 billion
heroin trade, building a network from southern China
to Sydney.  Police admit
that they are failing to stop nine out of ten heroin shipments.  A special
Herald investigation begins today";
<P>

	(ii)	A large colour photograph of Duong Van Ia was published under the heading
"The top heroin distributor";
<P>

	(iii)	Under the large colour photograph of Duong Van Ia was a heading "Banned
from casino, the drug dealer who bet more than $20m"
and then the words
<P>

		"Duong Van Ia The NSW Police Commissioner, Mr Peter Ryan, banned Duong Van
Ia, 42, from the Sydney Harbour Casino recently for
his suspected criminal
activities.  Duong has bet more than $20 million at the Casino since it opened
two years ago.  The Cabramatta
businessman, also known as Uncle Six, is
believed by police to be one of Australia's biggest heroin distributors.  His
network has
overtaken the notorious 5T gang, to become the major outlet for
heroin in Western Sydney".
<P>

	(iv)	Under the heading of the article "Unmasked:  our new drug bosses: in the
fourth paragraph to that article appear the words:
<P>

			"A Vietnamese refugee, Duong Van Ia, or Uncle Six, is being targeted by
police as the country's largest heroin distributor.
<P>

5.	On page six of the newspaper there was published an article headed "How a
big fish escaped the net" which stated in the fifth
column that "Police
intelligence suggests Lam himself became a major supplier to several Vietnamese
heroin distribution syndicates
in Cabramatta, including the current drug czar,
Duong Van Ia (see opposite story)."
<P>

6.	On page seven of the newspaper the following material was published:
<P>

	(i)	Under the Heading "The Mr Bigs when they carved out their names" was a
colour photograph of Duong Van Ia under which appeared
the words "Duong Van Ia
above right.  Risen to become a major heroin distributor at Cabramatta since
the late 1980's.  Recently banned
from casino after gambling $20 million there
in past two years".
<P>

	(ii)	Under the heading "Uncle Six:  from refugee to high roller" was an
article about Duong Van Ia accompanied by a photograph
of him with a woman and
child.  Statements in the article included
<P>

		(a)	"In Cabramatta they call him Uncle Six - the sixth of eight brothers who
sailed from Vietnam to Australia in the mid-1970s
with nothing.
<P>

			Duong Van Ia is now believed by police to control the largest slice of
Australia's biggest drug market - the streets of Cabramatta.
<P>

			Duong, 42, who barbeques pork for the restaurant trade for a living, is
certainly a wealthy man.
<P>

			Last month, he headed a list compiled by the NSW Police Commissioner, Mr
Peter Ryan, of suspected criminals he wanted banned
from the Sydney Harbour
Casino.  Duong had been one of the casino's best customers, gambling at least
$20 million in the highroller
room in the two years since the casino opened.
<P>

			`Number six is your classic criminal,' a Federal Police officer told the
Herald.  `He loves the high life and loves to be the
centre of attention.  When
he went to the casino he would park his car right out the front.  He would go
nuts if he wasn't allowed
to park where he wanted to.  He gets whatever he
wants.'
<P>

			Up until the late 1980s, Duong had just been one of the pack in Cabramatta -
small-time dealers on the make.  Members of his
family now live in enormous new
houses in Bonnyrigg Heights.  In one of those new houses lives his wife, while
his mistress, a Vietnamese
nightclub singer and danger (sic) known as Miss Kim,
is installed with their child in a separate high-security home in neighbouring
Fairfield.
<P>

			Duong was also a regular visitor to Jupiters Casino on the gold Coast and
Crown Casino in Melbourne, flying in for a night of
gambling.  Police
intelligence suggests that since being banned from the Sydney casino, he has
taken to the horses with gusto, betting
hundreds of thousands of dollars."
<P>

		(b)	"... in the late 1980s, according to police intelligence, Duong and other
Vietnamese dealers began trading directly with the
importers.  Police believe
Duong has recently gone one step further by partly financing his won
importation of heroin with the hep
of an important Chinese Australian
criminal.
<P>

			Duong is believed to buy his heroin in bulk (10 to 20 kilos) from the
importers for about $200,000 a kilo and then sell it to
the upper-level street
dealers, who distribute to runners."
<P>

		(c)	"Duong has allegedly used some of his family to help with his
distribution network.  One brother, Duong Van Thoai, was charged
in March with
supplying heroin.
<P>

			Another brother, Duong Quoc Dung, was sentenced to five years' jail earlier
this year after pleading guilty to possessing 3.7
kilograms of near pure heroin
..."
<P>

		(d)	"Duong Van Ia and his associates are believed to have sent millions of
dollars into accounts in Hong Kong and Vietnam, and
to have bought substantial
amounts of real estates in Vietnam."
<P>

7.	At the time of publication it was likely that the material relating to Duong
Van Ia published in the newspaper would be read
or otherwise come to the notice
of one or more persons who would become jurors in the said trial.
<P>

8.	Statements made in the material published in the newspaper and referred to
at paragraphs 4 to 6 hereof were likely or had a tendency
to interfere with the
administration of justice in connection with the said trial of Duong Van Ia in
that:
<P>

		(i)	they were likely to influence jurors to believe that Duong Van Ia had
previously committed offences involving the supply of
heroin or being
knowlingly concerned in the supply of heroin and that he continues to carry on
business as a large scale heroin distributor;
<P>

		(ii)	they were likely to influence jurors to believe that Duong Van Ia was a
person of bad character;
<P>

		(iii)	they were likely to influence jurors to determine the guilt of Duong
Van Ia otherwise than solely on the basis of the evidence
admitted at the
trial.
<P>

9.	Publication of photographs of Duong Van Ia in the newspaper made it more
likely that jurors who had read the said statements
would identify him at his
trial as their subject.
<P>

<b>The test for contempt</b>
<P>

3	The test for contempt has been expressed in a number of ways.  It has been
said that the publication complained of must have had
a real and practical
tendency to interfere with the administration of justice: <b><u>Attorney
General v 2UE &amp; Anor</u></b> Court of Appeal (NSW) 16 October 1997
unreported; that it must have had as a matter of practical reality a tendency
to interfere
with the course of justice in a particular case: <b><u>John
Fairfax &amp; Sons v McRae</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2093%20CLR%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 93 CLR 352</a>; that the tendency to
prejudice or embarrass pending proceedings must be clear, or real and definite,
or that there should be a substantial
risk of serious interference: <b><u>Hinch
v Attorney General (Victoria)</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 15.</a>
<P>

 4	The plaintiff must prove the tendency or risk beyond reasonable doubt.
<b><u>Witham v Holloway</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 525.</a>
<P>

  5	The Court has regard to a number of factors in order to determine whether a
publication amounts to contempt.  They include the
nature and extent of the
publication, the nature of the proceedings said to have been prejudiced
including whether they are proceedings
before a jury, and the time which
elapses between publication and trial.
<P>

6	The defendant admitted publishing the newspaper and it was agreed between the
parties that the Australian Bureau of Statistics
1996 Census of Population and
Housing reported these statistics -
<P>

&#183;	the number of persons over the age of 18 in the Sydney jury district was
approximately 1.9 million;
<P>

&#183;	the number of persons in the Sydney jury district over the age of 18
years who are Australian citizens was approximately
1.6 million;
<P>

&#183;	the number of persons in the Sydney jury district over the age of 18
years who are Australian citizens and who had been born
in Vietnam was 27,245;
and
<P>

&#183;	the number of persons in the Sydney jury district over the age of 18
years who are Australian citizens and who spoke Vietnamese
at home was
19,042.
<P>

7	The defendant admitted that the estimated readership of the Sydney Morning
Herald for weekdays in October 1997 for persons aged
18 years and over in the
postcode areas comprising the Sydney jury district was 539,135.
<P>

<b>The publication complained of</b>
<P>

8	The description in the Statement of Charge of the contents of pages numbers
1, 6 and 7 of the newspaper is accurate.  The publication
was quite striking.
The material complained of began immediately under the masthead.  Within a dark
blue background in white capital
letters appeared the words "A HERALD
INVESTIGATION".  The material on page 1 occupied the whole of the upper
two-thirds of the page.
 About 25% of that space was devoted to a good quality
colour photograph of a man the article named as Duong Van Ia.  It measures
20 x
14 cm.  Immediately over the top of the photograph appear the words "The Top
Heroin Distributor".  The letters are in white
against a bright red
background.
<P>

9	Underneath the photograph, following the words complained of in the statement
of particulars, appears the statement -
<P>

PROFILE PAGE 7
<P>

10	The material complained of on page 7 occupies about 60% of the page.  The
remainder of the page carries an advertisement.  Several
photographs of people
appear on the page.  Some of them, in black and white, are of six well-known
criminals.  Four are in colour.
 One is of Duncan Lam, the other person
prominently featured on the first page.  Next to it is a larger photograph of
Mr Duong, about
7 x 5 cm.  It is a smaller version of the photograph used on
the first page.
<P>

11	Two other colour photographs appear directly under a repeated headline "The
Top Heroin Distributor" in white lettering against
a bright red background.
The larger one is of Mr Duong, his fianc&eacute;e, Miss Kim, and their child
and shows a different view
of Mr Duong's face.  The other colour photograph is
of Miss Kim standing at a partially opened gate.  Miss Kim is said to be
"outside
her high security house".
<P>

12	Immediately at the end of the material on page 7 appears the following
paragraph -
<P>

In 1993, Duong Van Ia was charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of
223 grams of heroin and supplying 222 grams of heroin.
 He is yet to face trial
for these matters.
<P>

13	The principal factual issue over the quality of the publication is whether
it bore the tendency or risk asserted by the plaintiff
notwithstanding that the
trial was then five months away.  Before examining that issue, however, I
should deal with other submissions
made by the defendant.
<P>

14	The defendant submitted that any conclusion that the publication had the
tendency contended for would be conjectural and speculative.
 It was also
submitted that there was no evidence about the nature of Mr Duong's trial and
whether identification or good character
might be in issue.  Those submissions
wrongly assume that it has to be known at the time of publication precisely how
the trial will
be conducted.  What was known was that an accused person was
going to be tried on charges of supplying heroin.  The material complained
of
asserted that that was what he was in the business of doing.  There is an
obvious risk of prejudice where an accused person is
charged with an offence
and the jury are informed that he has committed just such an offence in the
past.  That is why such material
is rigorously excluded from the jury.
<b><u>Hinch v Attorney General (Vic)</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 15.</a>  It is
ordinarily appropriate to stop the case if such material comes to the jury's
attention.
<P>

15	There is an equally obvious risk of prejudice to a trial if the accused's
criminal record is revealed.  <b><u>Attorney General v Willessee</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980]
2 NSWLR 143.</a>  It is not necessary to enquire whether good character might be
raised as a defence.  The Crown is ordinarily precluded from raising
material
of the kind canvassed in the article complained of, and even if good character
is raised, may put such material to an accused
person only if the Court grants
leave.  <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s110.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 110.</a>
<P>

16	It was submitted for the defendant that there was no evidence that the
publication was really about Mr Duong, that is to say,
that the defendant may
have been mistaken in identifying him as the top heroin distributor and as a
man who was going to be tried
for knowingly taking part in the supply of heroin
and for supplying heroin.  It was part of this submission that the photographs
to which I have referred may have been of someone other than Mr Duong.  The
submission was made notwithstanding the evidence of Mr
Alexander, who was the
Editor in Chief of the Sydney Morning Herald at the time of the publication,
about the care which had been
taken to ensure a factual report.
<P>

17	It seems to me that since the publication asserted the facts to be true,
evidence of it must likewise be taken as evidence of
their truth.  If my
conclusion were wrong, the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> would
produce the same result.
<P>

18	The defendant relied, as necessarily raising a reasonable doubt about the
tendency contended for by the plaintiff, on a judgment
by his Honour Judge
Shillington QC in the District Court of New South Wales on 5 December 1997.  Mr
Duong applied to his Honour for
a stay of proceedings on the indictment,
relying on the publication now said to be contemptuous.  In refusing the stay,
his Honour
remarked -
<P>

I think it would be highly unlikely that any juror or prospective juror would
link up this publicity with the person appearing in
the dock on 23 March and
during the trial.
<P>

19	I do not accept the defendant's submission.  As I observed in my judgment
refusing the defendant's application for a stay of
proceedings, nothing was
determined in favour of the defendant by Judge Shillington.  His Honour's
judgment was made in the exercise
of his discretion and his Honour's opinion
that it would be highly unlikely that any juror would link up the publicity
with the accused
was not essential to the decision.  Nothing in his Honour's
judgment binds this Court to entertain a reasonable doubt about the tendency
contended for.
<P>

20	The defendant's principal submission was that there was a reasonable doubt
whether any juror would remember the articles and
connect them with Mr Duong in
view of the facts that -
<P>

1.	At the time of publication the trial was about five months away;
<P>

2.	The articles did not canvass the subject matter of Mr Duong's trial or
assert that he was guilty of those charges.  The fact
that he was facing the
charges was referred to only in the final paragraph of one of the articles;
<P>

3.	Mr Duong was not well known at the time of the publication.  His name was
phonetically and visually unfamiliar to a non-Vietnamese
reader;
<P>

4.	The publicity was not repeated; and
<P>

5.	it was reasonable to suppose that the jurors would adhere to their oath and
obey the directions of the trial judge to decide
the case only on the evidence
admitted at the trial.
<P>

<b>The evidence of Dr Williams and Professor Vidmar</b>
<P>

21	The defendant relied on the expert opinions of two witnesses, Dr Kipling
David Williams, Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology,
University of New
South Wales and Professor Neil (Joseph) Vidmar, Russell M Robinson II Professor
of Law at Duke University School
of Law, North Carolina, United States of
America.
<P>

22	Dr Williams is a psychologist who has held several academic posts, including
visiting and acting professorships, and has written
a large number of papers on
various subjects dealing with the social behaviour of people.  He has
researched and written about the
effects of judicial instructions on jury
verdicts.
<P>

23	Professor Vidmar holds a doctorate in social psychology and has devoted much
of his professional career to researching and writing
about jury behaviour,
including the study of the potential effects of pre-trial publicity.  Relying
on his own research and on the
published work of others, he gave evidence about
the ability of jurors to remember what they read in newspapers.
<P>

24	Dr Williams and Professor Vidmar were furnished with a copy of the
publication and with particulars of Mr Duong's trial, the
circulation and
readership estimates of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper within the Sydney
jury district and the rules about the
eligibility of persons to serve as
jurors.  They were informed of the charge brought by the plaintiff and what it
must prove to succeed.
 They also assumed, as was agreed to be the fact, that
on the day of publication Mr Duong was not well known.
<P>

25	Dr Williams and Professor Vidmar made a number of general observations about
the ability of people to remember what they read.
 The following propositions
seem not to have been contentious.  Accurate memory for names, faces and text
may diminish rapidly over
time, sometimes within minutes, sometimes within days
or months.  An important factor is whether the information is rehearsed and
processed in such a manner that it enters long term memory.  People do not
easily remember a face which has racial characteristics
different from their
own.  The identification of a live face from a photograph is less reliable than
identification from a previous
sighting of the face itself.  Names are less
easily recognised than faces.  People are less likely to remember a name which
is not
repeated or which is expressed in an unfamiliar language.  When two or
more names or faces are referred to it is harder to remember
one of them.
<P>

26	Mr Williams was of the opinion that it was highly unlikely that the articles
in question and the photographs within them would
be remembered by jurors in
the Sydney jury district approximately five months after their publication.  He
also thought it highly
unlikely that, five months after publication, the
articles complained of could have influenced jurors.
<P>

27	Dealing with the likelihood that any juror would be influenced in the
relevant way by a single exposure to the publication five
months before the
trial, Dr Williams said this -
<P>

Probabilistically speaking, the likelihood that any juror seated at Duong Van
Ia's trial would accurately remember and be influenced
by the material in the
article requires a number of steps.  These steps would include (but are not
limited to) the probability that
any reader:
<P>

(a)	was exposed to the 27 October 1997 issue of the Sydney Morning Herald;
<P>

(b)	attended to the articles and photographs in question;
<P>

(c)	processed the information and photographs at the deeper than superficial
level;
<P>

(d)	rehearsed the information enough so that it entered what is commonly known
as long-term memory;
<P>

(e)	formed a negative opinion of Duong Van Ia's character and inferred his
guilt; and
<P>

(f)	remembered this information and/or was influenced by this opinion and
inference five months later in the court of law.
<P>

The end probability is determined by multiplying the probabilities (which can
range between 0.0 and 1.0) of each step by each other.
 This means, that the
end probability will always be substantially lower than any of the individual
probabilities (as long as any
of the probabilities are less than 1.0).  It also
means that as any individual probability approaches zero, the end probability
will
also be near zero.  Based upon my knowledge and expertise, and of the
literature on memory and forgetting, it is my opinion that
the probability of
the last stage (f) - the persistence of any memory or influence after five
months), approaches zero.
<P>

28	Defence counsel relied on that passage of Dr Williams' report, pointing out
that when assessing risk a small risk multiplied
by a small risk results in an
even smaller risk.  I do not think, however, that Dr Williams' conclusion has
the kind of methodical
or mathematical integrity that the passage I have quoted
would appear to give it, and I find his process of reasoning not altogether
easy to understand.  I will explain why.
<P>

29	First, it seems necessary when calculating the probability of the existence
of an ultimate fact by reference to the probabilities
of the existence of other
facts that those probabilities be independent of each other.  The steps set
forth in the paragraph I have
quoted are not.  For example, all the persons who
qualify for step (b), because they attended to the articles and photographs in
question, must also qualify for step (a), because they must have been exposed
to the publication.  If one knows the probability for
(b), it seems unnecessary
to enquire into any of the components of (b).  If, for example, the probability
at step (b) were 0.3, it
would be misleading to bring into the calculation the
probability at step (a).  If that were 0.4, Dr Williams' calculation would
produce a probability for (b) of 0.12, yet the probability for (b) is clearly
0.3.
<P>

30	The same comment may be made about steps (d), (c), (b) and (a), because it
seems reasonable to suppose that all who qualify for
(d) may all qualify for
(c), who may all qualify for (b), who may all qualify for (a).
<P>

31	I do not intend by confining my comment to the first four steps to imply any
acceptance that the remaining steps are independent
of each other.
<P>

32	Secondly, Dr Williams does not say what other steps are necessary for the
calculation of the relevant probability.
<P>

33	Thirdly, he makes no calculation.
<P>

34	I accept the statement that when a number of probabilities have to be
multiplied together in order to produce the ultimate probability,
the closer
any individual probability approaches zero, the higher the probability will be
that the end result will approach zero
as long as any other probability is less
than 1.0.  But Dr Williams' opinion, to the effect that the persistence of any
memory or
influence after five months approaches zero, appears based not upon
any mathematical comparison of individual probabilities but,
as he says in his
report, upon his knowledge and expertise, and of the literature on memory and
forgetting.
<P>

35	There are several reasons why I think that Dr Williams' knowledge and
expertise may not be entirely reliable for present purposes
and why the
literature on memory and forgetting, upon which his opinion was largely based,
may not be apposite.
<P>

36	In his report, Dr Williams puts forward the opinion, which I think should be
accepted, that people of one race find the faces
or persons of other races
harder to remember than those of persons of their own race.  However, Dr
Williams appears to have assumed
that all members of Mr Duong's jury were
likely to be non-Asian.  At any rate, no allowance is made in coming to his
ultimate conclusion
for the possibility of persons of Asian origin being
members of the jury.
<P>

37	The report concentrates on faces and names and the difficulty people have in
remembering them, but no mention is made of other
reported characteristics or
information which might make a reader more likely to remember what was read.
Dr Williams conceded in
cross-examination that biographical information which
has a particular interest for a reader is likely to make the reader pay more
attention and be more likely to remember for a period of time.  The articles
complained of contain a good deal of such biographical
information which I
think would be likely to increase the tendency of a reader who was particularly
interested in any of them to
remember what was read.  They include that he is a
refugee from Vietnam, that he lives in Cabramatta, that he is known as "Uncle
Six", that he is the sixth of eight brothers, that he has a mistress called Kim
and that they have a child and that two of his brothers
have the names given in
the article.
<P>

38	Examples of these details were put to Dr Williams in cross-examination and
although he was not persuaded to change his ultimate
opinion I think that his
failure to take them into account in his report detracts from that opinion.
<P>

39	Dr Williams approached the problem as though the question were whether any
one person randomly selected from the community would
remember enough of the
articles to connect them with Mr Duong at his trial.  He understood that
accused persons are tried in this
State by a jury of twelve but seemed at first
not to appreciate that the appropriate question was whether any one of a jury
of twelve
persons randomly selected had any relevant memory.  He appeared to
confuse the question whether any one juror was influenced because
of a
recollection of what had been read with the question whether that juror might
influence the other members of the jury.
<P>

40	These questions and answers took place in cross-examination -
<P>

Q.  At paragraph 6 you were saying this probably approached zero?
<P>

A.  The probability that any one individual would remember anything that they
saw once five months earlier is near zero. I am confident
of that statement.
<P>

Q.  That is the wrong question, the wrong question. The correct question is the
probability that one out of the twelve people randomly
selected will
remember?
<P>

OBJECTION.
<P>

Q.  Do you agree that is the right question or not?
<P>

A.  Not totally. I agree that it is an issue that as long as one person
remembers out of twelve that it could bring the issue to
the floor during
deliberation. I cannot say that all it takes is one to have the effect. I do
not agree with that. So there is a
lot of factors that would have to be taken
into account to come to a reasonable assessment.
<P>

Q.  We might take a step back? I thought you agreed with me that if one juror
is affected then that juror's perception, because
of his knowledge, that is
enough to prejudice his trial?
<P>

OBJECTION.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   Is Mr Berman wrong in thinking that?
<P>

A.  I recall he said if one person remembers that information, could that
prejudice that individual and I said it could.
<P>

BERMAN:  Q.  I just want to do this as a matter of probabilities. In coming to
your conclusion surely you had to take into account
that the chance of one
person out of twelve randomly selected in remembering is higher than the chance
of one person randomly selected
remembering?
<P>

A.  I agree with that.
<P>

Q.  You had to take that into account?
<P>

A.  That is an important factor. I was looking at it as the chance that anyone
would remember in general.
<P>

Q.  It is an important factor that you did not take into account?
<P>

A.  It would be if the numbers were high. If the numbers are near zero and you
say times twelve, it is still going to be an extraordinarily
small number.
<P>

Q.  You say multiplied by twelve?
<P>

A.  I am not sure which is the right way to say what it is like, to say any one
in twelve would remember so, as I said earlier,
I would have to think about the
formula.
<P>

41	Dr Williams was unfamiliar with the formula which is used to convert the
probability that any single person may remember to the
probability that any
person out of twelve randomly selected persons may remember.
<P>

42	Dr Williams relied on the results of a number of surveys to reach his
opinion.  As far as he knew, however, the participants
in those surveys were
asked only once whether they remembered the thing about which their memory is
being tested.  He agreed that
the surveys made no attempt to replicate a
criminal trial and were a poor substitute for a trial.
<P>

43	It seems to me that there are at least two fundamental differences between
questions asked about a particular subject matter
in a survey and the
presentation of prompting information at a trial.  First, at a trial, which may
last several days, there is a
continual and repeated process in which
information is presented which may stir the memory.  For example, jurors will
see the accused's
name printed in court lists, on notice boards and in the
newspapers and probably in documents tendered at the trial.  They will hear
the
accused's name repeated throughout the trial.  They will hear other
information, such as nicknames and other attributes of the
accused which may
become relevant.  So a name or a face which provokes only a vestigial or
uncertain memory at first may, when repeated
or presented with other relevant
information, revive the memory.  On the other hand, the presentation of a
question once only in
a survey is much more likely to bring about a negative
response.
<P>

44	Secondly, participants in surveys are questioned individually.  Indeed, it
appears that special care may be taken to prevent
the memory of any participant
influencing that of any other.  Yet that is the process that is likely to go on
during the deliberations
of the members of a jury at a trial.  So a dim memory
of one juror may spark or be sparked by the memory of another juror.
<P>

45	For these reasons, I think that the survey results and opinions, upon which
Dr Williams based his opinion derived from circumstances
so different from
those of a jury trial that I ought to be cautious about accepting any opinion
based upon them.
<P>

46	Professor Vidmar was asked to give his opinion whether the publication was
likely to be remembered by or to influence jurors
at the trial of Mr Duong on
23 March 1998 and he concluded that as a matter of practical reality the
likelihood was very small that
the articles complained of had adverse effects
on the belief or attitude toward Mr Duong of persons exposed to them.
<P>

47	Like Dr Williams, Professor Vidmar relied for his opinion on the results of
surveys conducted and papers written by himself and
others.  As before, the
circumstances contemplated by those surveys and papers were far removed from
the circumstances of a jury
trial.  Professor Vidmar also assumed that there
would be no persons of Vietnamese origin on Mr Duong's jury.  For reasons I
have
already explained, therefore, his opinion also needs to be treated
cautiously.
<P>

48	I thought that the evidence of Professor Vidmar suffered because of his
unwillingness or inability to answer certain questions
by reference to his own
experience of life.  If he could not find an answer in the literature on which
he relied he preferred not
to give an opinion.
<P>

49	I will give some examples.  He was asked whether a person of Vietnamese
origin would pay more attention to the articles than
a person of another
origin, but could offer no opinion because it was not a subject he had
examined.  He agreed that people tend
to remember things that are of particular
interest to them, but was quite equivocal when asked whether a person whose
brother had
recently died of a heroin overdose might pay particular attention
to the articles.  He could not say whether a person who had a mistress
called
Kim or who barbecued pork for the restaurant trade might for those reasons be
more interested in the articles and remember
them better.
<P>

50	I thought that this reluctance on the part of Professor Vidmar suggested an
approach that leaned away from the practical towards
the theoretical.  The
question that I have to answer is a practical one.
<P>

<b>Professor Vidmar's experiment</b>
<P>

51	Unlike Dr Williams, Professor Vidmar relied also on the results of a survey
he had designed to test the ability of members of
the public to remember the
details of the publication complained of.  The survey was carried out in Sydney
according to his instructions
in the following manner.  A number of readers of
the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper were asked to attend at the offices of a
Sydney
marketing research organisation.  They were divided randomly into four
groups.  The members of group A were given a complete black
and white photocopy
edition of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper of 27 October 1997.  The members
of group B were provided with
copies of the editions of 27, 28 and 29 October
1997.  The members of group C were given a copy of the edition of 3 November
1997
and those of group D were given copies of the editions of 3, 4 and 5
November 1997.
<P>

52	The publications of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper other than that of
27 October 1997 may be summarised as follows.  Immediately
after the article
about Mr Duong in that publication there appeared under the heading "TOMORROW"
the words "The carve-up of Kings
Cross".  The edition of 28 October 1997
contained a headline on the first page and a leading article about nursing home
fees.  Unlike
the previous day's edition, the front page of the newspaper was
laid out according to the normal pattern.  A regular feature called
"Column 8"
had been restored to its usual place.  There were two other articles on the
front page, unrelated to drugs.  Also, under
the heading "A HERALD
INVESTIGATION" appeared the statements in large type "A new push is on to carve
up the drug trade.  The Herald's
special investigation continues", and "Big
guns target the Cross".  Underneath appeared a large photograph of Mr Tom
Domican.  Underneath
the photograph was a short article which named a number of
well-known criminals.  At the end of the article was a reference to page
8,
which was fully devoted to the subjects of drugs and drug dealers.  There were
references to well-known criminals, and they were
named, but Mr Duong was not
mentioned.  The article ended with the words "The kings of cannabis" under the
heading "TOMORROW".
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=53%20Page%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">53	Page 4</a> of the edition of the 29th October 1997 contained the third article
of the series.  It was principally about money laundering.  There
was no
mention of cannabis and the article foreshadowed on the previous day did not
appear.
<P>

54	The edition of 3 November 1997 contained articles on the front page and on
page 6 dealing with a proposal by the Federal Government
to spend sums of money
to reduce the supply of drugs into Australia, to rehabilitate drug users, to
fund medical research and education
about drugs.
<P>

55	The edition of 4 November carried articles on pages 4 and 5 criticising the
attitude of the Prime Minister as set forth on the
previous day, explaining how
easy drugs were to obtain and dealing with police corruption in relation to
drugs.
<P>

56	The edition of 5 November does not appear to have carried any material
relevant to the present proceedings.
<P>

57	The participants were asked to read the newspaper or newspapers as they
would ordinarily have read them.  After having done so,
each participant was
asked to complete a written questionnaire.  They were paid a sum of money and
informed that the researchers
might telephone them to ask additional questions
after the analysis of data.
<P>

58	About fourteen days later, those from the marketing research organisation
telephoned each participant and asked a series of questions
designed to
determine the extent to which each participant recalled the names Duong Van Ia
and Uncle Six and any connection made
between those names and other names which
appeared in the articles they had been asked to read.
<P>

59	Not all participants were prepared to respond to the repeated request for
information.  Of those that did, 79 were in group A,
30 were in group B, 19
were in group C and 18 were in group D.
<P>

60	During the telephone interview, participants were asked a number of
introductory questions about a number of topics which had
been dealt with in
the newspapers they had read.  Then followed a series of questions the answers
to which formed the basis of Professor
Vidmar's conclusions and opinions.
Participants were asked whether they could recall reading or hearing any news
stories during the
past two years that involved the illegal drug trade, such as
heroin or cocaine in Australia.  97% of participants said that they
could, and
there were no significant differences between any of the four groups.
Participants were then asked whether they could
provide the names of persons
associated with the stories and explain how they were so associated.
<P>

61	18% of participants in group A said that they could do so, compared with 40,
32 and 28% respectively in groups B, C and D.  None
of the participants
mentioned the name Duong Van Ia.  Two mentioned the name Uncle Six and one
mentioned Duncan Lam, the other alleged
drug boss featured on the first page of
the edition complained of.  Persons whose names were mentioned included the
well-known criminals
referred to more than once in the articles.
<P>

62	Participants were then asked whether they could give the names of any
persons identified as "drug bosses".  Those who said they
could comprised 22,
30, 11 and 6% respectively of the four groups.  One participant said "Uncle
something", another said "someone
Lam" and several referred to "Asian names"
that they could not remember.  Participants were able to remember the names of
well-known
Sydney criminals, however,
<P>

63	Participants were then asked to listen to a list of twenty names which were
read in random sequence.  Some of the names were
well known.  Two, namely Lan
Tran Cao and Philip Tran, were invented by Professor Vidmar in order to try to
identify prejudice which
might exist among the participants towards anyone with
a Vietnamese name.
<P>

64	15% of participants in group A recognised the name Duong Van Ia.  Of the
other groups, 10, 5 and 6% respectively recognised the
name.  Not all
participants identified the name by reason of any connection mentioned in the
publication complained of.  Some thought
that he was concerned with murder.
Most recognising the name seem to have connected it with the drug trade.
<P>

65	37% of respondents in group A recognised the name Uncle Six, compared with
20, 11 and 6% respectively in the other groups.  Most
identified that person as
being involved in the heroin trade.
<P>

66	The participants who recognised the name Duncan Lam comprised 24, 10, 11 and
17% respectively of the four groups.  Most said
that he was a drug boss or
involved in the illegal drug trade.
<P>

67	19% of the participants in group A, 20% of group B, 21% of group C and 6% of
group D said that they recognised the name Lan Tran
Cao.  Most connected the
name with drugs.
<P>

68	The other fictitious name, Philip Tran, was asked about and 33% of the
members of group A, 20% of group B, 26% of group C and
17% of group D readers
said that they were familiar with the name.
<P>

69	The rate of identification of names of persons about whom media coverage was
intense or prolonged was much higher than for the
names I have just dealt with.
This demonstrates the correctness of Dr Vidmar's opinion that repeated
rehearsal of a fact is likely
to produce a longer or more reliable memory of
it.
<P>

70	The participants were then asked whether during the past two years they had
read or heard anything about a Vietnamese immigrant
called Lan Tran Cao, a
Vietnamese immigrant called Duong Van Ia or someone named Uncle Six.  They were
asked whether there was any
connection between Lan Tran Cao or Duong Van Ia or
Uncle Six and any other person.  They were asked the real name of the man
called
Uncle Six.
<P>

71	There was no significant increase in the rate of recognition of those three
names over the rate that resulted from the earlier
question about recognition
of those names.  One person identified Duong Van Ia as Uncle Six.
<P>

72	On these results Professor Vidmar based his opinion that public recall and
recognition of the name Duong Van Ia was very low
at what he called an absolute
level and by comparison with names which had a appeared more extensively in the
news media.  He said
that the survey results were consistent with other
research results which he had studied.
<P>

73	Professor Vidmar also expressed the opinion, based on the alleged
recognition by participants of the names Lan Tran Cao and Philip
Tran that
there was a strong suggestion of substantial levels of generic beliefs about
Asians, particularly Vietnamese persons, being
associated with organised crime
and the drug trade.  He pointed to the fact that in groups A and B recognition
of the names Lan Tran
Cao and Philip Tran was greater than that of Duong Van
Ia.  He concluded that two weeks after the publication of the "drug bosses"
and
"Uncle Six" articles there were "relatively little" recognition and recall
memories of Duong Van Ia as a drug boss that could
be separated from general
assumptions about the involvement in drugs and other crimes of people with
Vietnamese names.  That did
not mean that there was no recognition of the name
Duong Van Ia, but that it was just as likely that there was an alternative
explanation
for the participants' asserted recognition of the name.
<P>

74	Professor Vidmar's last opinion calls for close examination, because there
is evidence that may throw doubt upon it.  First,
the context in which the
questions about Lan Tran Cao and Philip Tran were asked needs to be understood.
By the time the fictitious
names Lan Tran Cao and Philip Tran were introduced,
participants had already been asked what stories they remembered about the
illegal
drug trade and whether they remembered the names of persons associated
with it, and whether they could name persons identified as
"drug bosses" or
"heroin distributors".  Then there was read to them a list of twenty names,
including Lan Tran Cao and Philip Tran.
 The next question was whether during
the past two years they had heard of a Vietnamese immigrant called Lan Tran
Cao.
<P>

75	It seems to me that the context must have led the minds of the participants
to an expectation that they would be asked about
a Vietnamese person who had
some connection with the illegal drug trade.  Furthermore, the question
suggested something that would
have been true of Mr Duong, namely that Lan Tran
Cao was a Vietnamese immigrant.  I think, therefore that the false
identification
of Lan Tran Cao as having been connected with the drug trade
must be given little weight.  I would not regard it in context as giving
rise
to a reliable inference that there was a substantial level of generic belief
about Asian, particularly Vietnamese, persons as
being associated with
organised crime and the drug trade.
<P>

76	Secondly, and more importantly, the names chosen as a control both contained
the name Tran, a very common Vietnamese family name.
 A number of persons were
dealt with by that name for serious offences in New South Wales within the
period of time about which the
participants were asked.  Not all of those
prosecutions may have been given wide publicity, of course, but one of them
was.  During
1998 an extended Coroner's inquest was held into the death of a
member of the New South Wales Parliament, Mr John Newman, and the
names of the
defendants were widely publicised.  One of them was Mr Tuan Van Tran.
<P>

77	When Mr Tran was committed to this Court for trial he applied for bail.  One
of his applications was heard on 12 January 1999.
 In the edition of the Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper of 13 January 1999 the defendant published a
substantial account of the application.
 It summarised the arguments put on
behalf of the applicant and the Crown and quoted some of the remarks of the
judge who determined
the application.
<P>

78	The telephone survey was carried out between 29 January and 3 February 1999.
One of the topics raised before the subject of illegal
drugs was the murder of
Mr Newman.  Participants were asked whether they knew the names of any persons
associated with the murder.
<P>

79	Although those claiming to recognise the name Lan Tran Cao did so primarily
because they connected the name with drug dealing,
other reasons were advanced
as well, for example -
<P>

"For drugs and murder;" "I've heard of it but again I'm not sure where, perhaps
with the drug trade I think;" "Connected to Cabramatta;"
"He was one of the
people charged with the murder of the politician;" "Maybe Cabramatta but I
don't know;" "Vietnamese, he'd done
something wrong."
<P>

80	In a similar way, those claiming to identify the name Philip Tran did so
because he was a drug dealer or was involved with the
murder of Mr Newman.
<P>

81	In the circumstances I do not accept that the survey results demonstrate the
existence in the community of any general assumption
that Vietnamese persons
are involved in drug or other crimes.  I therefore reject the conclusion of
Professor Vidmar that the survey
results show that the "drug bosses" and "Uncle
Six" articles resulted in relatively little recognition and recall memories of
Mr
Duong as a drug boss that could be separated from general assumptions about
persons with Vietnamese names being involved in drugs
and other crimes.
<P>

82	Professor Vidmar began his evidence with a concession that the figure of one
person out of 79 who recognised the name Duong was
"unreliable" and probably an
underestimate of what would happen at a trial.  He then pointed to some
features of the survey which,
he said, made for more conservative and therefore
more reliable results.  First, he said, and I understood it not to be
challenged,
that only about one-third of the relevant population reads the
Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.  The likely rate of recognition or
memory
retention in the jury population generally, therefore, should be taken to be
only about one-third of the rate demonstrated
in the survey.  I think that the
point is well taken.
<P>

83	Secondly, the telephone survey was carried out only two weeks after the
participants read the newspapers they were given, whereas
the trial of Mr Duong
was not due to take place until five months after the publication complained
of.  During the intervening time,
Professor Vidmar said, interpolated memory
and other activities would occur, causing the memory of individuals to fade
more and more.
<P>

84	There may be substance in this argument also, though it is difficult to know
how great it is in view of the evidence of both
experts that memory of the
detail of an event rapidly diminishes unless there exist any of the features
which may combine to produce
long term memory.  There was no attempt by the
experts to quantify and compare the likely loss of memory after two weeks with
the
loss after five months or by any other means to compare the degree of
memory loss likely to have been experienced after each of those
two periods of
time.  The impression that I received from the evidence generally is that
unless an event is of such interest or importance
or of such a striking nature
as to produce long term memory, little if any of it will remain in the memory
after two weeks.  On the
other hand, if an individual creates long term memory
of an event, whilst it seems reasonable to suppose that that memory will fade
over a long time, it is difficult to say whether there will be any significant
loss of memory between a time two weeks after the
event and a time five months
after the event.
<P>

85	Professor Vidmar also said that since participants in the survey must have
anticipated that there would be questions about what
they had read, they would
be more likely than other readers to remember what they read, so the survey
results would tend towards
the conservative.  He thought also that, since
during the interview it must have become apparent that participants were being
asked
about drugs and drug bosses, they were likely to guess at answers
providing responses consistent with what they anticipated might
be the purpose
of the study.  That also would tend to increase the number of positive
responses.
<P>

86	I agree that these factors would tend to make the survey results
conservative.
<P>

87	There were other features of the survey which in my opinion tend to detract
from the reliability of the results.  I have already
touched upon the question
whether the number of participants was high enough to enable confident
predictions to be made about the
memory of members of the community from whom
the jury was to be drawn.
<P>

88	The principal difficulty I have in giving effect to the survey results,
however, lies in the difference between the conditions
of the survey and the
conditions that would prevail at a trial in New South Wales.  There are several
features of this difference.
<P>

89	First, the survey was carried out without any warning, other than an
indication two weeks earlier that participants might be
asked questions later
on.  So there was no possibility that the memories of participants might be
stimulated by the repetition of
relevant information between the two stages of
the survey.
<P>

90	On the other hand, members of a jury know the name of the accused in
advance.  They are told at the beginning of the trial what
the charges are and
the facts the Crown proposes to prove.  During the trial that follows they
repeatedly hear, see and read things
which may stimulate the memory.
<P>

91	Secondly, the questions in the survey formed the only possible means of
memory stimulation for participants.  At a trial the
means of memory
stimulation are many.
<P>

92	Next, the telephone survey was short and each question was asked only once.
It was known at the time of publication that Mr Duong
faced a substantial trial
on two heroin charges that might reasonably be supposed to last for a number of
days.  (It is now known
that Mr Duong's trial lasted nine days but I do not
take that precise period into account because that fact was not then known.)
At a trial which lasted for a number of days jurors would repeatedly see, hear
and read material which might stimulate their memory
of the articles.
<P>

93	Next, the photographs of Mr Duong were a striking and important feature of
the publication.  Not only were only reduced black
and white versions of them
seen by the participants.  During the survey that followed they were shown no
photographs at all.  The
jurors would see the accused, and perhaps even
photographs of him, throughout the trial.  I have not overlooked the
observation of
Dr Williams that identification or recognition of a live person
from a photograph may be less reliable than from a face, but I am
of the view
that jurors having some memory of the article and the photographs would have a
significantly greater chance of memory
stimulation by seeing Mr Duong and
remembering the photographs than would participants in the survey.
<P>

94	Next, the name of Duong Van Ia and the subject of drugs were never connected
during the telephone survey.  In the tenth question,
participants were asked
whether in the past two years they had read or heard anything about a
Vietnamese immigrant named Duong Van
Ia and about the context in which they had
heard or read the name.  It is true that in preceding questions participants
had been
asked about the illegal drug trade, about drug bosses and heroin
distributors and had had read to them a list of twenty names, including
Mr
Duong's name.  However, the two topics were never brought together in the way
they would be at a trial.
<P>

95	This is not a criticism of the framer or the conductors of the survey.  It
is not difficult to understand why those designing
surveys prefer to test
unprompted memory.  However, the distinction, which I think important,
illustrates at once the impossibility
of replicating trial conditions in a
survey and the consequent difficulty about accepting survey results as a
reliable indicator
of what might happen at a trial.
<P>

96	Next, there is no way of assessing the degree of commitment of survey
participants and whether they were prepared to make a genuine
effort to answer
fully and honestly.  Those asking the questions had no control over such
matters because they were out of the presence
of those they interrogated.
Since the participants were telephoned without warning, it must be supposed
that they had other things
on their minds and allowance must be made for the
distraction caused by those and other things.  Of 188 persons followed up, 42
could
not be contacted or declined to take any further part, and this
demonstrates that not every participant was wholeheartedly committed
to the
success of the survey.
<P>

97	There are well established methods of ensuring that the attention of jurors
at a trial is not distracted.
<P>

98	Next, although it was conceded by Professor Vidmar that jurors might
possibly recognise Mr Duong from biographical information
written about him in
the articles, there was no testing of recognition by such means.  The articles
mentioned Mr Duong's being a
heavy gambler, being in the business of barbecuing
pork for the restaurant trade and having a mistress called Kim.  It is more
than
mere speculation to say that evidence of any of these matters might have
become admissible at the trial, giving jurors a further
means of recognising
the accused as the man written about.
<P>

99	Next, the article was not current news and therefore lacked the interest
which current news may have by the time it was read
by participants in the
survey.  For that reason it was less likely to be memorable to them.
<P>

100	Next, because by January and February 1999 the subject of the article was
no longer current, the possibility can be excluded
of survey participants
reading or hearing anything about the subject matter between the time they read
the newspapers they were given
and the time they were asked questions over the
telephone.  The position with jurors would be quite different.  Jurors who read
the
article may well have owned the copy of the newspaper which contained it.
It was more than a mere sensational piece of news reporting.
 It was a special
report of an investigation, being the first in a promised series.  It contained
indications about the content of
forthcoming publications.  For that reason
alone it might have been kept by some of those who read it.  It might have been
re-read
between the date of publication and the date of trial, especially
within the first few days after publication.
<P>

101	Furthermore, there were in the news media further references to the article
which might have reinforced memory of it.  The article
was critically mentioned
in the ABC television program "Media Watch" on 3 November 1997 and was
reprinted in the Vietnamese language
in the Vietnamese newspaper Dan Viet, the
Vietnamese Tribune, on 30 October 1997.
<P>

102	Professor Vidmar conceded in cross-examination that the more distinctions
there were between the survey and the real life situation
the more the validity
of the conclusions drawn from the survey were decreased.  I have come to the
view that the limitations on the
survey were so great and the differences
between the conditions of the survey and those which would apply at a trial
were so marked
that the survey results cannot form the basis for any reasonable
conclusion that there was a small likelihood as a matter of practical
reality
that the material complained of had significant adverse effects at the trial of
Mr Duong on the beliefs and attitudes of
persons exposed to them.  Insofar as
Professor Vidmar relies on his survey results to justify that opinion, I reject
his opinion.
 I am not satisfied that he has demonstrated any basis independent
of his survey results as reasonably supporting that opinion.
<P>

103	Moreover, certain of the survey results show the opposite of the position
contended for by the defendant.  11 members of group
A recognised the name
Duong Van Ia, seven of them in connection with drugs.  25 recognised the
nickname Uncle Six, 22 of them in
connection with drugs.  I accept the analysis
and submissions of counsel for the plaintiff that it follows from these results
that
27 of the 79 members of group A identified either Duong Van Ia or Uncle
Six as a person connected with drugs.  That, it seems to
me, is a high rate of
recognition.
<P>

<b>Whether the publication had the tendency asserted by the plaintiff</b>
<P>

104	My rejection of the opinions of Dr Williams and Professor Vidmar does not
determine the matter, however.  I must be satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt
that the material complained of did have the tendency contended for.
<P>

105	There could scarcely be more prejudicial statements than those contained in
the articles about a man facing charges concerning
the supply of heroin.  He is
described as a drug boss and a top heroin distributor, a "Mr Big".  And is said
to be targeted by police
as the country's largest heroin distributor.  He is
said to have a network which has become the major outlet for heroin in western
Sydney.  All those statements appear on the front page of the newspaper.
<P>

106	On page 6 he is called a "drug czar".
<P>

107	On page 7 he is called one of "the Mr Bigs", is said to have become a major
drug distributor at Cabramatta since the late 1980s,
to be the top heroin
distributor, to control the largest slice of Australia's drug market, to have
headed a list of suspected criminals
the Police Commissioner wants banned from
the Sydney Harbour Casino, to have begun trading directly with heroin importers
and to
have begun partly financing his own importation of heroin with the help
of an important Chinese Australian criminal.  He is said
to have a practice of
buying heroin in amounts of ten to twenty kilograms at $200,000 per kilogram
and selling it to upper level
street dealers.
<P>

108	The statements I have summarised are highly prejudicial.  If any juror at
Mr Duong's trial remembered any of them he would not
in my opinion receive a
fair trial.
<P>

109	Dr Williams and Professor Vidmar drew attention to the preparedness of
jurors faithfully to follow the directions of the trial
judge, including
directions to put out of their minds any material other than that presented to
them in the court room.  There might
be cases where the prejudice of a possibly
contemptuous article might be cured in such a manner, but this is not one of
them.  In
my opinion no direction to a jury could cure the prejudice flowing
from these articles.
<P>

110	Counsel for the defendant put forward another of Professor Vidmar's survey
results as demonstrating the shortness of the public
memory for names.  During
1998 the condition of water supplies to the Sydney metropolitan area became the
subject of public comment.
 Citizens were advised alternately that water was
fit to drink and not fit to drink.  Those responsible for the water undertaking
came under intense criticism.  Mr David Hill, the Chairman, was well known as
being active in political circles.  He was a former
managing director of the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation and had for a time been chief executive of
the State Rail Authority.
 He continued for other reasons to be prominent in
news reporting after the end of the water crisis.  The managing director of the
water undertaking, Mr Chris Pollett, was not well known.  One result of the
affair was that he resigned from his position and thereafter
fell from the
public gaze.
<P>

111	The survey results showed that Mr Hill was remembered by a high proportion
of participants but that Mr Pollett's recognition
level was low.
<P>

112	Whilst these results demonstrate that the names of well known persons are
likely to be remembered better and longer than those
of other persons, I do not
think that they assist the defendant.  One of the principal purposes of the
publication complained of
was to call attention to the change in control of the
illicit drug industry.  The names and descriptions of the actors were central
to that purpose.  During the water crisis, on the other hand, public reporting
and comment were concerned more with the appropriateness
of the activities of
the undertaking and whether the undertaking was accurately reporting the facts
to the public.  The names of
persons occupying executive positions in the
undertaking may not have been unimportant, but they were of only incidental
interest.
<P>

113	The striking and unusual way in which the articles were presented made them
more memorable than ordinary leading newspaper articles.
 Mr Duong's photograph
on the front page was unusually large, in colour and of good quality.  It was
repeated on page 7 and on the
same page appeared a different good quality
colour photograph of Mr Duong, taken from a different angle.  Both photographs
were of
the face only.  They were likely to assist in recognition.
<P>

114	The articles contain other information about Mr Duong which, seen from the
date of the publication, might have been introduced
into evidence at the trial.
They were that he was a Vietnamese refugee, that he came from Cabramatta, that
he was a businessman barbecuing
pork for the restaurant trade, that he lived at
Bonnyrigg Heights, that he was known as "Uncle Six" and that he had a mistress
called
Miss Kim.
<P>

115	The articles were intended to be noticed and remembered.  They were
intended to be read as a series, of which this was the first.
 So they
contained indications of what was to follow.  One of the indications, appearing
at the end of the article on page 7, was
that Mr Duong was going to be tried on
the heroin charges.
<P>

116	Professor Vidmar pointed out that many newspaper readers tend only to scan
articles and to pay more attention to the earlier
than the later parts of
articles.  I accept that that may be so, but these articles were different in
that they formed part of a
series.  At the end of the front page article about
Mr Lam there was a reference to page 6.  There was a reference to something the
Australian Federal Police Commissioner was going to say on page 6.  Under the
photograph and statements about Mr Duong there was
a reference to page 7.  At
the end of the article on page 7 about Mr Duong, immediately under the trial
reference, was the heading
"TOMORROW", followed by the words "The carve-up of
Kings Cross".  So readers' eyes were drawn to the end of the article as part of
the scheme of the series.
<P>

117	As I have already observed, Dr Williams and Professor Vidmar appear to have
approached the matter as though the question were
whether any one juror would
be prejudiced after reading the articles, though there is some doubt whether Dr
Williams was even prepared
to go so far.  I am satisfied, however, that the
proper question is whether any one out of twelve people randomly selected from
the
population would be prejudiced.  There seems now to be agreement that the
probability of any one person out of twelve randomly selected
being prejudiced
is eleven times greater than that any one person randomly selected would be so
prejudiced.
<P>

118	The articles were permanent in that they were printed and could be kept,
read and re-read.  They were in a form designed to
attract a re-reading because
they formed part of a series.
<P>

119	They were referred to again in the "Media Watch" television program and in
the Vietnamese newspaper.  Such further references
were likely to increase the
probability of memory.
<P>

120	As I have observed, a high proportion of survey participants identified
either Duong Van Ia or Uncle Six as a person connected
with drugs.
<P>

121	In view of these matters I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that as a
matter of practical reality the articles had the tendency
to interfere with the
due course of justice at Mr Duong's trial, not withstanding that it was not due
to take place for a further
five months.
<P>

<b>The public interest defence</b>
<P>

122	The defendant by its counsel submits that it did no more than it was
entitled to do in discussing a matter of great public concern.
 This was "the
discussion of public affairs and the denunciation of public abuses, actual or
supposed" referred to by Jordan CJ in
<b><u>Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd;
Re Truth and Sportsman Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1937/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] NSWStRp 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2037%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 37 SR (NSW) 242</a> at 249.
<P>

123	Freedom of speech, public discussion and information should not be
qualified except in the face of public interest of equal
or greater importance.
<b><u>Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders
Labourer Federation</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20152%20CLR%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 152 CLR 25</a> per Mason J at 98.
<P>

124	The right of freedom of speech is not absolute, however, and the law curbs
freedom of speech where it is necessary to do so
to prevent a real and
substantial prejudice to the administration of justice.  <b><u>Hinch v Attorney
General (Vic)</u></b> per Wilson J at 41.
<P>

125	The public interest in ensuring that criminal proceedings are conducted
free of prejudice will attract great weight and make
it less likely that public
interest in the freedom of discussion of matters will outweigh it.  <b><u>Hinch
v Attorney General (Vic)</u></b> per Wilson J at 37.
<P>

126	That does not mean, however, that the defence cannot succeed if criminal
proceedings are affected.  The whole of the circumstances
of the publication
and its relationship if any to the relevant trial must be considered.  The
ultimate practical question is whether
it is reasonably open to say that the
detriment to the trial is outweighed by the public interest in freedom of
communication.  The
plaintiff must prove that it is not.  <b><u>Hinch v
Attorney General (Vic)</u></b> per Deane J at 51.
<P>

127	The content of the articles may be summarised as follows.  The persons
controlling crime, particularly drug crime, were changing.
 The old controllers
had passed on for various reasons.  The new ones included Mr Duong and Duncan
Lam.  A cultural and financial
revolution had taken place, resulting in that
change.  The Federal Police Commissioner estimated that between two and three
thousand
kilograms of heroin were imported annually, worth up to $3 billion,
and that only 220 kilograms had been ceased in the last year.
 The Federal
Police could investigate only one in six or seven major heroin trafficking
syndicates, the result of the size and worldwide
nature of the drug trafficking
industry and the inadequacy of law enforcement resources in Australia.  The
Government had pegged
or reduced the amount of money available for law
enforcement.  Chinatown was the seat of major heroin dealing and Cabramatta was
the place where it was distributed by Vietnamese persons.  Mr Duong rose to
prominence after the gaoling of Salvatore Lapa in 1993.
<P>

128	It seems to me that the articles and the editorial dealt with matters of
substantial public interest.  Although the article
about Mr Duong discussed his
current activities and details of his personal life, there was no discussion of
the facts or circumstances
of the charges pending against him.  His guilt or
innocence of those charges was not mentioned.
<P>

129	Nevertheless, it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
statements about Mr Duong's being a major heroin distributor
and having been
involved in large scale drug operations implied that he was guilty of the
charges.
<P>

130	If the articles had been about the commission by Mr Duong or others of
particular, named offences, there might have been substance
in that submission.
But I think that the articles were really about personalities and control.
Although a statement, in the context
of the trial of an accused for a
particular offence, that that accused has committed similar offences may
prejudice the accused at
his trial, that is a less serious thing to say than
that the accused is guilty of the very offences for which he is to be tried.
No such thing is implied in the material complained of.
<P>

131	I do not accept the plaintiff's submission that the public interest in the
discussion of such matters as these was of little
relevance and weight or that
there was no public interest in the naming of a man who was not well known.
The discussion was about
the emergence of new leaders of the illicit drug
industry.  In my opinion, the naming of the successors was an integral part of
the
discussion and as pertinent as the naming of those succeeded.
<P>

132	It was not submitted that the defendant had any intent to interfere with Mr
Duong's trial.  I am satisfied that there was no
such intent.
<P>

133	The mention of the charges, however, is a matter of concern, because one of
the effects was to potentiate interference with
the administration of justice
at the trial insofar as it was likely to provide a link within the memories of
persons forming the
jury between the subject in the article and the identity of
Mr Duong at the trial.  It played no part in the discussion of matters
which
were in the public domain.  It was extremely careless and ought not to have
happened.  However, that does not change my view
that the prejudicial effect of
the articles was incidental and unintended.
<P>

134	The articles were part of a substantial series of articles dealing with
subject matter of substantial broad public interest.
 The trial was likely to
raise narrower issues which were only incidental to those canvassed in the
articles.  In view of these matters
and the other matters I have dealt with I
think that it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial was
outweighed
by the public interest in the freedom of communication.
<P>

135	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has negated the defence of public
interest.
<P>

136	The summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff must pay the defendants' costs.  I
grant liberty to the parties to apply for an assessment
of costs.
