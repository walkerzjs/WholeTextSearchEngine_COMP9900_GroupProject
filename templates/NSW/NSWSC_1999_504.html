<b>Remarks on Sentence</b>
<P>

1	The prisoner was indicted for the murder of Shane Peter Greenacre at
Villawood on 19 February 1997.  He pleaded not guilty but
guilty of
manslaughter, and the Crown prosecutor accepted that plea in satisfaction of
the indictment.  The plea was entered on the
basis that the prisoner had caused
the death of Mr Greenacre by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
<P>

2	The circumstances of the offence are most distressing.  On the evening in
question the prisoner, who was then seventeen years
old, was in the company of
a number of young companions, both male and female.  He and a young woman
walked to a hotel to buy cigarettes.
 Outside the hotel the young woman became
involved in an argument about nothing of any consequence with another woman,
Tricia Guth,
who was unknown to her.  The prisoner and the young woman rejoined
their companions and the group decided to return to the hotel
to confront Ms
Guth.
<P>

3	On the way some members of the group armed themselves with empty beer bottles
found outside a house.  The prisoner was not one
of them, but he had a knife
which he normally carried for protection.  As they approached the hotel, Ms
Guth was leaving it in company
with the deceased, whom she had met only that
night.  A verbal altercation occurred near the hotel.  Ms Guth ran off and was
pursued
by three of the prisoner's female companions, who caught up to her and
assaulted her.
<P>

4	At the same time, the deceased ran across the road and was chased by the
other members of the group, including the prisoner. 
Beer bottles were thrown
at him, some of which struck him on the back.  On the other side of the road he
tripped and fell.  He was
kicked to the head and body but, on the material
before me, I am not satisfied that the prisoner took part in that activity.  It
was in the course of this assault that he was stabbed three times in the right
thigh.  One of those stab wounds severed his femoral
artery, leading to his
death.
<P>

5	When first spoken to by police, the prisoner denied any knowledge of the
incident.  About a month later, when spoken to again,
he admitted having been
present during the assault but denied that he had stabbed the deceased or that
he had seen anyone else do
so.  Finally, in an electronically recorded
interview on 27 June 1997, he admitted responsibility for the stabbing,
although I suspect
that his account of the surrounding circumstances was still
expurgated to some extent. 
<P>

6	The prisoner said that he saw blood on his knife but had no recollection of
having stabbed the deceased.  This may be true, as
it is not uncommon for
people to have an impaired memory of a sudden and frightening event.
Particularly is this so when, in the
course of that event, they have committed
a serious and uncharacteristic act of violence.
<P>

7	There is evidence to suggest that more than one knife was used.  The forensic
pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination
considered that the fatal
wound was inflicted by a different knife from that which caused the other two
wounds.  As I have said,
in the electronically recorded interview the prisoner
accepted responsibility for the stabbing and did not suggest that anyone else
had also used a knife.  If someone else had been involved, one can only
speculate as to why the prisoner adopted the position he
did, a position from
which he did not depart in the proceedings before me.  It could be the result
of impaired memory or, of course,
a desire not to implicate one of his
companions.
<P>

8	However that may be, by his plea of guilty to manslaughter the prisoner has
formally admitted involvement in the killing, whether
or not he himself
inflicted the fatal wound.  Of course, he does not stand for sentence on the
basis that he intended to kill the
deceased or to cause him serious bodily
injury.  The crime is that the death of the deceased was brought about by an
unlawful act
which, viewed objectively, carried with it an appreciable risk of
serious injury.  This is not to deny the seriousness of the prisoner's
conduct.
It was an exhibition of mindless violence perpetrated upon a man who had done
absolutely nothing to provoke it.  Too often
does this Court have to deal with
cases such as this: spontaneous, senseless killings by young men armed with
knives which they claim
to carry for their own protection.  
<P>

9	One of the prisoner's companions was also charged with the murder of the
deceased and has yet to face committal proceedings. 
The others appeared in
Children's Courts on charges of common assault or affray, and were dealt with
by way of recognisance or Community
Service Order.  It is not suggested that
any question of parity of sentence arises. 
<P>

10	I received in evidence a victim impact statement by the family of the
deceased.  It speaks movingly of the effect upon his extended
family of their
tragic loss and, in particular, expresses the feelings of his parents and his
three sisters.  It is eloquent testimony
to the serious and enduring effects of
the premature and violent death of a loved one.  To all of those people the
Court expresses
its deepest sympathy.  However, it would not be appropriate to
have regard to that statement in determining the sentence which should
be
passed, for the reasons expressed by Hunt CJ at CL in <i>R v Previtera</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 76.</a>  His Honour's approach in that case has been
consistently adopted by the judges of this Court when passing sentence in
homicide cases.
<P>

11	The prisoner is now nineteen years old.  He has one entry on his criminal
record, a matter which was dealt with in a Children's
Court and which is of no
present significance.  I have the benefit of a background report by Mr Ken
Bourke of the Department of Juvenile
Justice.  I have also heard evidence from
Ms Dianne Langham, the Chaplain at the Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre, where
the prisoner
has been detained, from the prisoner himself, and from his parents
and his brother.
<P>

12	From this material it appears the prisoner has had, and continues to have,
the benefit of a caring, responsible and supportive
family.  Nevertheless, he
appears to have lost direction in his life some months prior to this offence,
taking to drugs and alcohol
and keeping undesirable associates.  It was in this
context that the crime was committed.  It is now clear that his arrest and
incarceration
have chastened him and his lengthy period in custody has matured
him significantly.
<P>

13	These have been the observations of his family, who have maintained regular
contact with him whilst in custody, and of the officers
of the Department of
Juvenile Justice responsible for his management.  His education had progressed
to the stage of Year 11 at the
time of his arrest. While in custody he has
undertaken a number of courses, one of them in carpentry and joinery, for which
he has
shown a particular aptitude.  He has also devoted himself to sporting
activities, working towards the Duke of Edinburgh Award.  To
his credit, he
took no part in the recent disturbances at Kariong.  The background report
describes his behaviour and attitude whilst
in custody as "co-operative,
responsible and mature", and assess him as "a young man committed to
establishing himself as a positive
member of the community".
<P>

14	Part of his maturation has been the development of an insight into the
enormity of his crime.  He had expressed his remorse to
his family, to Mr
Bourke and Ms Langham, and he did so again in evidence before me.  I accept it
as genuine.  Upon his release, he
has the support of his family and good
prospects of employment.  There is every reason to be confident of his
rehabilitation.  Nevertheless,
as he is a young man who has yet to prove
himself outside a custodial setting, I believe the community would be served by
his being
subject to supervision and the sanction of parole for an extended
period.  Accordingly, I find special circumstances within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(2)</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.
<P>

15	The sentencing of a young man with good prospects of rehabilitation for a
serious crime is one of the most difficult tasks a
judge has to undertake.  A
balance must be struck between the community's interest in a sentence which
reflects the gravity of the
crime, on the one hand and the rehabilitation of a
young offender, on the other.  The matter has been the subject of a number of
authoritative statements in superior courts, which it is unnecessary to repeat.
Some of them are to be found in the judgment of Mathews
J in <i>R v GDP</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2053%20A%20Crim%20R%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 53 A Crim R 112</a> at 116.  The sentence I propose is the best I can do to
strike that balance.  It will commence on the date the prisoner was taken
into
custody, 16 April 1997.
<P>

16	TM (named), you are sentenced to penal servitude for five years, comprising
a minimum term of 3 years to commence on 16 April
1997 and to expire on 15
April 2000, and an additional term of 2 years to commence on 16 April 2000 and
to expire on 15 April 2002.
I direct that the remainder of your sentence be
served in a Juvenile Justice Centre.
<P>
