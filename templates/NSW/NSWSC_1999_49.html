<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> By case stated the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals
against the dismissal of an information alleging that in breach of Section
4(1)
and (3) of the Traffic Act 1909 (NSW), the Respondent drove a motor vehicle
upon a public street negligently, occasioning the
death of a person.
<P>

2	In consequence of the events which led to that charge, the Respondent had
been indicted before His Honour Judge Mitchelmore on
a charge under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act 1900</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52A(1)</a> that he drove a vehicle when it was involved in an
impact occasioning the death of the person named and at the time of the impact
he was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person.  On 4
December 1996 the Respondent was acquitted of that charge.
 The Magistrate who
dismissed the information concerning what I may call the negligent driving
charge, had tendered before him a
copy of the summing up of Judge Mitchelmore
and it was the terms of that and the Respondent's acquittal which formed the
foundation
for the Magistrate's decision under appeal.  In the words of the
Stated Case:-
<P>

	"I held that the only issue left for the jury's determination in terms of the
manner dangerous test appeared to have been whether
the Respondent had failed
to keep a proper lookout and the jury's decision can only mean that they were
not satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt in that regard.
<P>

	I held that since that issue, as opposed to the test under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> or Section 4 of the Traffic Act, had already been determined by the
Jury, the effect of the proceedings under Section 4 would be
to re-try that
issue, which has already been determined by a properly instructed Jury.  I
therefore held that the Defendant was entitled
to invoke the principle against
double jeopardy and to enter a plea in bar to the proceedings under Section 4
of the Traffic Act.
 I, therefore, dismissed the information."
<P>

3	Before me this finding as to the effect of the jury's decision and the
conclusion that the Defendant was entitled to invoke the
principle against
double jeopardy and to enter a plea in bar were the subject of challenge.
Consideration of the former requires
attention to the terms of the summing up
Judge Mitchelmore gave to the Jury, a copy of this summing up being attached to
the stated
case.  Having considered it, my conclusion is that it provides no
basis for a finding that the only issue left for the jury's determination
was
whether the Respondent had failed to keep a proper lookout.  Passages from the
summing up which lead me to this view are as follows.
 (For convenience and
ease of future reference I have numbered the paragraphs and indicated the page
of the transcript of the summing
up on which they appear.  The paragraphs
quoted are not necessarily consecutive):-
<P>

	"<b>Page 2</b>
<P>

	(i) There is no dispute that Mr McIvor was killed. There is no dispute Mr
McIvor was killed in this impact.  There seems no dispute
that the Accused was
the driver of the red truck that was involved in the impact as a result of
which Mr McIvor was killed.
<P>

	(ii) However, other than those matters where there is no dispute between the
Crown and the Accused, I will be endeavouring to express
no opinion on the
facts at all..
<P>

	Page 6
<P>

	(iii) I now propose to set out for you the essential elements of the charge
that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt.
 There are four of them:
<P>

	1. That the Accused was the driver at the relevant time.
<P>

	2. That he was driving in a manner dangerous to the public.
<P>

	3. That while he was so driving there was an impact with Mr McIvor's
vehicle.
<P>

	4. That as a result of that impact the death of Lawrence McIvor occurred.
<P>

	(iv) As I understand it, the first, third and fourth elements are not in
dispute.  That is, the Accused admits he was the driver
at the relevant time;
that there was an impact with Mr McIvor's vehicle and as a result of such
impact, the death of Mr McIvor was
occasioned.
<P>

	<b>Page 7</b>
<P>

	(v) However, it is the second element and the second issue which is most in
dispute.  That is, at the relevant time the accused
was driving in a manner
dangerous to the public.
<P>

	(vi) In order to determine whether the Accused was driving in a manner
dangerous to the public, you must first decide in what manner
he was driving.
You must then consider the circumstances in which he was driving.  Both of
those are simple fact-finding exercises.
 Having decided how he was driving and
in what circumstances, then you decide whether that manner of driving was, in
those circumstances,
dangerous to the public.
<P>

	(vii) The test of driving in a manner dangerous to the public is an objective
test.  The Crown does not have to prove that the
Accused intended the
management and control of his vehicle to be dangerous to the public.  His
conduct can be judged, and must be
judged, according to an objective standard
fixed in relation to all uses of public roads generally.  That is what is meant
by an
objective test.
<P>

	(viii) You must determine whether the conduct of the Accused amounted to a
serious breach of what you consider to be the proper
management and control of
a vehicle upon a public road, so serious as to be, in reality, a potential
danger to other persons on,
or in the vicinity of, that roadway.  By manner of
driving I mean the manner in which the accused controlled and managed the motor
vehicle.
<P>

	<b>Page 8</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>(ix) It is for the Crown to prove the manner of driving is dangerous.
Here the Crown say the Accused veered into the incorrect side
of the road.
This is the driving which the Crown relies upon as being dangerous to the
public.
<P>

	(x) Now it is not permissible to say that because there has been an accident
and someone has died as a result, then the manner
of driving must have been
dangerous.  You must consider all the facts as disclosed by the evidence and
ask yourself whether they
establish the manner of driving alleged was
dangerous.  Here we are concerned with a manner of driving which in the
particular circumstances
creates a real danger; a manner of driving that falls
short of the proper management of a motor vehicle on a road, so far short that
it amounts to a crime.
<P>

	<b>Page 9</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>(xi) But I repeat, that what must be proven and proven beyond
reasonable doubt is some serious breach of the proper management and
control of
the Accused's vehicle on a public road, so much so that it amounts to a
criminal act.
<P>

	<b>Page 10</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>(xii) Now, applying the law that I have just set out to you to the
factual situation here, now in order for the Accused to be convicted
you must
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his driving at the time of impact was
not mere negligence but it was of such a
nature that it was of a more serious
breach of the regard for the safety of others.
<P>

	(xiii) As I have stated to you on a number of times, you must be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the driving of the Accused
at the relevant time
was so dangerous that it amounted to a criminal act.
<P>

	<b>Page 11</b>
<P>

	(xiv) I will set out for you, in summary form, the matters on which the Crown
seek to rely.
<P>

	(xv) The Crown allege that as a result of the Accused veering into the
incorrect side of the road, a collision occurred with Lawrence
McIvor who was
driving along the same road at the same time, in the opposite direction to the
Accused.  Mr McIvor, it is common ground,
was also driving a truck at the time.
You have heard that Mr McIvor died as a result of injuries received in the
impact.
<P>

	<b>Page 12</b>
<P>

	(xvi) The Crown say the Accused had a clear view of the bridge for over a
kilometre.  The Accused collided with a truck coming
the other way.  The driver
of the truck was killed in the accident.  The Crown say the Accused was driving
without keeping a proper
lookout.  The Crown say that the Accused failed to
brake when he should have braked.  The Crown say the skid marks and the length
of the skid marks attest to the Accused's dangerous manner of driving.
<P>

	(xvii) The Accused says the Crown have not established beyond reasonable doubt
that he was driving in a manner dangerous to the
public.
<P>

	<b>Page 13</b>
<P>

	(xviii) The Accused's counsel says that the Accused was a victim of
circumstance.  Counsel for the Accused says there was lattice
on the road - on
the bridge.  Counsel for the Accused says the Crown have not negatived beyond
reasonable doubt that the Accused's
heavy braking was due to an obstruction in
front of the Accused.  In any event, Counsel for the Accused says emergency
braking is
not necessarily dangerous driving.  Counsel for the Accused says
that here the emergency braking was a split-second decision.
<P>

	(xix) Mr Charteris, counsel for the Accused, puts to you in all the
circumstances of this case, the driving of the Accused cannot
constitute,
beyond reasonable doubt, dangerous driving.
<P>

	Page 15
<P>

	(xx)...What follows is a summary of the Crown's submissions to you.
<P>

	(xxi) The Crown says to you the real issue is whether the Accused was driving
in a manner dangerous to the public.  The Accused
was driving the red truck.
Any driver should keep a proper lookout.  The Crown asks rhetorically "Why did
the accident occur?  The
Crown says you have the record of interview and the
Accused said "I was driving along, the next minute everyone just suddenly
slowing
down.  I just hit my brakes, that's all I remember".
<P>

	<b>Page 16</b>
<P>

	(xxii) The Crown say to you "Look where the skid marks start".  The Crown say
to you that the skid marks point to an inevitable
conclusion that the Accused
was not keeping a proper lookout; the Accused was not watching the bridge and
the cars on the bridge.
 The Crown say that the Accused assessed his position
far too late.  There was no reason that the Accused should not have assessed
his position some significant time before he did.
<P>

	(xxiii) The Crown argue that the Accused applied emergency braking and the
Crown say that the reason for the emergency braking
was because the Accused was
not watching out where he was going.  He was not keeping a proper lookout.  The
Crown say that the Accused
failed to apply his brakes at the first proper and
reasonable opportunity.  The Crown say latticework or no latticework, the
Accused
had a lot of time, a lot of notice, that the latticework was there.
<P>

	<b>Page 17</b>
<P>

	(xxiv) The Crown say that the collision occurred and Mr McIvor died because
the Accused was driving in a manner dangerous to the
public.  The Crown say
that the only appropriate verdict is one of guilty.
<P>

	(xxv) That being in brief summary of the matters that the Crown put to you.
What follows now is the summary of what Mr Charteris,
counsel for the Accused,
put to you.
<P>

	(xxvi) His submissions, in summary, as follows (sic): Are you satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt the Accused is guilty of the charge
before the Court?  The
counsel for the Accused pointed out the Accused has no recollection.  This, of
course, it is said, makes the
presentation of the Accused's case quite
difficult for him.  The Accused's counsel says the prosecution cannot show you
what was
on the road.  The Crown does not put to you any reason at all for the
emergency braking.  The submission for counsel for the Accused
is the Accused
was the victim of the circumstance.
<P>

	<b>Page 18</b>
<P>

	(xxvii) Counsel for the Accused says the matter of the lattice is quite
important - very important - in this trial.  Counsel for
the Accused asserts to
you that there could have been more lattice than one piece of lattice.  Counsel
for the Accused submits to
you that the Crown's presentation of evidence about
the lattice is both incomplete and unsatisfactory.
<P>

	(xxviii) Counsel for the Accused says to you that you should not assume the
lattice was lying flat on the road, no evidence one
way or the other about
that.  Counsel for the Accused puts to you that you might well think the
obstruction was the cause of the
emergency braking.
<P>

	<b>Page 19</b>
<P>

	(xxix) ...Counsel for the Accused urges upon you that you will find there was
lattice on the road and counsel for the Accused says
the accident took place on
the bridge, and if you look at the plan and the photos you will see that the
bridge does not give a truck
driver - or any driver for that matter - many
options.  Counsel for the Accused said that emergency braking was the
appropriate option
for the Accused to take.
<P>

	(xxx) Counsel for the Accused said that you will not be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt the Accused is guilty of this offence.
 Counsel for the
Accused says the appropriate verdict is one of not guilty and urges you to
enter that verdict as a result of your
deliberations in this trial.
<P>

4	The paragraphs I have numbered (i)-(v) show that His Honour was concerned to
contrast issues not in dispute from issues which
were in dispute.  Having
identified that what was in dispute was the second element of the charge as His
Honour formulated it, he
then went on in paragraph (vi) to break that element
down into the topics of manner, circumstances and what I may call
characterisation.
<P>

5	In the paragraphs I have numbered (viii) and (x)-(xiii), His Honour directs
further attention to the question of characterisation
and whether the
Defendant's manner of driving, whatever that manner may have been, answered the
description "dangerous to the public".
 To similar import are parts of the
paragraphs I have numbered (xvii), (xix) and (xxi).
<P>

6	It may be conceded that in the paragraphs in which His Honour was directing
attention to the factual issues bearing on the manner
of the Defendant's
driving the issue of whether the Defendant was keeping a proper lookout loomed
large - see e.g. paragraphs (xvi)
(xix), (xxii) and (xxiii).  However, had that
been the only issue posed for the jury's determination, there would have been
no need
for much of the balance of the summing up which I have quoted.
<P>

7	Considered in totality, the summing up provides no ground for the
Magistrate's finding that the only issue left for the jury's
determination was
whether the Respondent had failed to keep a proper lookout.  Thus there was no
basis for his conclusion that the
jury's decision meant that they were not
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in that regard.  For example, the jury may
well have accepted
that the Defendant was not keeping a proper lookout but
taken the view - and whether rightly or wrongly does not matter for present
purposes - that the failure was not, to quote from the paragraph of the summing
up I have numbered (xi) so "serious breach of the
proper management and control
of the Accused's vehicle on a public road... that it amounts to a criminal
act."  Thus the foundation
for the invocation of principle against double
jeopardy and the entering of a plea in bar did not exist.
<P>

8	It is appropriate that I say also that the circumstances which the Magistrate
had to consider were not such as to permit of any
application of a plea in bar
or, as His Worship was sitting in a local court, a defence in the nature of a
plea in bar - see <b>Pearce v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%201416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 1416</a> at p 1420.  In
that case the topic of pleas in bar was the subject of consideration and it was
made clear that such a plea requires
that attention be paid to the elements of
the offences involved.
<P>

9	The charge on which the Defendant was acquitted by the jury was brought under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52A.</a>  As formulated against him, its essential
elements were that:-
<P>

	1. He was the driver of a motor vehicle.
<P>

	2. While being so driven that vehicle was involved in an impact with another
vehicle carrying Mr McIvor.
<P>

	3. The impact occasioned the victim's death, and
<P>

	4. At the time of the impact the Defendant was driving in a manner dangerous
to another person or persons.
<P>

10	The charge brought against the Defendant before the Magistrate was under the
Traffic Act, s4.  As formulated the essential elements
of this charge were:-
<P>

	1. The Defendant was driving a motor vehicle.
<P>

	2. Upon a public street.
<P>

	3. Negligently.
<P>

	4. Occasioning the death of Mr McIvor.
<P>

11	Sub-section 4 (2) requires that in considering whether an offence has been
committed, a court have regard to all of the circumstances
of the case
including the nature, condition and use of the street and the amount of traffic
which is or might be expected to be upon
it, matters clearly relevant to the
question whether a manner of driving was dangerous.
<P>

12	The concept of driving negligently means driving in a manner which is
negligent and a convenient definition of "negligent" is
"careless, unheedful,
inattentive" - expressions which direct attention to the attitude of the
driver.  The concept is quite different
from driving in a manner which is
dangerous - a concept which looks to the effect, actual or potential, on
others, albeit a manner
of driving may involve both concepts.  Thus each
offence involves proof of a fact which the other did not. <b>Pearce v The
Queen</b> (supra) at p 1421 says that therefore the plea has no application.
<P>

13	On this ground also the magistrate erred.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to
make the following orders:-
<P>

	1.  Quash the decision of Paul Anthony Sloane, magistrate, given on 17 March
1998, dismissing an information laid against the Respondent,
alleging that on
14 July 1995 at Berkshire Park, in the State of New South Wales, he did drive
an motor vehicle, to wit, International
Acco Table Top lorry bearing
registration number KWI-671, upon a public street, negligently, occasioning the
death of one Laurence
McIvor, in breach of section 4(1) and (3) of the Traffic
Act 1909 (NSW).
<P>

	2.  Declare that Paul Anthony Sloane erred in holding that the jury's
decision, at the trial in the District Court in which the
jury returned a
verdict of not guilty of an offence under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52A(1)</a>,
can only mean that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the
First Defendant had failed to keep a proper lookout
and that the First
Defendant was entitled to invoke the principle against double jeopardy and to
enter a plea in bar to the proceedings
under the Traffic Act 1909 (NSW), s4.
<P>

	3.  Order that the Second Defendant proceed to hear and determine the said
information according to law and in accordance with
the Reasons delivered in
these proceedings.
