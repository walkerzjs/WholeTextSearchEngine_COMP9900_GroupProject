THE SUPREME COURT

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

AUSTIN J
<P>

MONDAY 7 JUNE 1999
<P>

<b>2587/99 - OCEAN MARINE MUTUAL INSURANCE ASSOCIATION LIMITED (IN PROVISIONAL
LIQUIDATION)  V  ERKAG PTY LIMITED (LIQUIDATOR APPOINTED)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Section 500(2) of the Corporations Law says that
`after the passing of a resolution for voluntary winding up, no
action or other
civil proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company
except by leave of the Court and subject
to such terms as the Court imposes.'
The plaintiff has sought, amongst other things, a declaration that the
provisions of s 500(2)
of the Corporations Law have no application to
proceedings in the United Kingdom.  The summons in the matter was filed on 3
June
1999 and made returnable before Young J on 4 June 1999 who stood it over
to the Company List where it comes before me today. 
<P>

2  	Today, the parties consent to the Court making a declaration that
the provisions of s 500(2) have no application to proceedings
in the United
Kingdom.  The Court would not necessarily make a declaration on a point of law
expressed in those relatively wide terms
simply on the basis that the
declaration was made by consent.  However, in the present case it appears to me
clear that the law is
to the effect of the declaration which is sought.
<P>

3  	In <i>United States Surgical Corporation v Ballabil Holdings Pty
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20ACLC%20639" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4 ACLC 639</a>, McLelland J held, relying on English authority,
that s 371(2) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code had no application to
proceedings
in Connecticut on the ground that the words `action or other civil
proceeding' in that subsection were confined to actions or proceedings
in New
South Wales and did not extend to actions or proceedings in a foreign court.
<P>

4  	The successor to s 371(2) is s 471B of the Corporations Law.  The
wording of the new provision puts the outcome beyond doubt.
 Relevantly, the
new provision states that where a company is being wound up in insolvency or by
the Court or a provisional liquidator
of a company is acting, the person cannot
begin or proceed with `a proceeding in a court against the company'.   The word
`court'
is defined in s 58AA(1) to mean any court when exercising the
jurisdiction of this jurisdiction.  I had occasion to explore the meaning
of
that definition in <i>Brian Rochford</i> <i>Ltd v Textile Clothing &amp;
Footwear Union of NSW </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2030%20ACSR%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 30 ACSR 38.</a>   For the reasons there given, my
opinion is that a proceeding in the United Kingdom is not, for the purposes of
s 471B, a proceeding
in a court as defined in s 58AA. 
<P>

5  	In the present case the liquidation is a voluntary liquidation
and the relevant provision is s 500(2) rather than s 471B.  However,
it appears
to me that the outcome is the same.  While the amended wording of s 471B
referring to a `court' is not found in s 500(2),
the wording of the latter
provision is indistinguishable from the wording of s 371(2) of the Companies
Code which was dealt with
by McLelland J in the <i>USSC </i>case.  In my
opinion nothing turns on the fact that the wording of s 500(2) has not been
amended to bring it into line with s 471B
because the same result flows from
McLelland J's decision. 
<P>

6  	It is, therefore, appropriate for me to make the declaration
sought by consent. 
<P>

7  	On the question of costs, the defendant submits that an order
should be made for the plaintiff to pay its costs.  However, it
seems to me
that the matter was one appropriate to be the subject of proceedings in this
Court.  The defendant says that if more
time had been given it could have
conducted legal research sufficiently early to consent to the declaration
without any necessity
for an appearance.  However, in a case such as the
present one where the consent of the parties is not determinative of the
outcome,
it appears to me sufficiently helpful to have appearances in person by
both sides that such a course would have been of assistance
in any event.   In
those circumstances it seems to me that there should be no order as to
costs.
<P>

8  	The parties have, by consent, handed me a document entitled Short
Minutes of Order which I initial date for the purposes of
identification.  I
make the declaration in paragraph 1 of that document.  I add a new paragraph 2,
noting that there is no order
as to costs.  I also note that although the short
minutes refer to the applicant and respondent, I take it that these orders
dispose
of the summons as well as the Notice of Motion in the proceedings.
<P>
