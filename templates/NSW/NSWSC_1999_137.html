CORPORATIONS - Winding up - Administration.  After summons for winding up
served, company appoints administrators and applies for
adjournment.
Administrators notify creditors of administration, but not of winding up
proceedings, and obtain proxies from 80% of
value.  HELD that, while weight
should be given to views of creditors, less weight could be given to the views
of those not asked
to choose between administration and winding up; that it was
generally in the interests of creditors that an insolvent company be
administered by someone not selected by directors; and that the onus of proving
administration was in the interests of creditors
was not discharged.

<P>

<b><u>UNIFOR OFFICE SYSTEMS AUSTRALIA PTY. LIMITED  V.  BREWER PARTNERSHIP PTY.

<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   I am dealing with an application for adjournment of proceedings
to wind up the defendant company, on the grounds
set out in s.440A(2) of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

2	In this case, the winding up summons was filed and served on 22nd January
this year.  On 22nd February this year, two registered
liquidators under the
Corporations Law, Mr. Lord and Mr. Kerr, were appointed joint and several
administrators of the defendant.
 Accordingly, the first requirement for an
adjournment under the provision I have referred to is satisfied, and the
question which
I have to determine is whether I am satisfied that it is in the
interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue
under
administration.
<P>

3	For the company, it has been submitted that the evidence shows that the
company has no assets, but that the administrators are
negotiating with the
previous principals of the company for an arrangement which they say is likely
to result in a distribution to
creditors of between five and ten cents in the
dollar.  The administrators have obtained proxies from 80 percent in value of
the
creditors, and to that extent, the evidence suggests that the
administration has the support of those creditors.  It is put that
the
administrators have similar duties to a liquidator to investigate the affairs
of the company and to act in the interests of the
creditors.  In any event, it
is put that there is no evidence of any matters which suggest that proceedings
by a liquidator or by
the administrators against the former principals of the
company is likely to yield any benefit for creditors.
<P>

4	For the plaintiff, it is submitted that the onus of satisfying the Court that
the continuance of the administration is in the
interests of creditors has not
been satisfied.  The plaintiff, with a debt amounting to about 20 percent of
the unsecured debts,
is the only creditor who has taken an active interest in
the matter.  Reliance was placed on the long history of the plaintiff's
attempts to obtain payment:  the obtaining of a District Court judgment in
September 1997; the service of a statutory demand on 16th
February 1998; the
de-registration of the company on 27th February 1998; the obtaining of
reinstatement of registration; a further
statutory demand served on 23rd
October 1998, followed by the summons in these proceedings, followed again by
the appointment of
the administrators.  Reliance was placed on the advantage of
having a relation-back period commencing one month earlier.  I was referred
also to the cases of <u>DCT v. Yates Securities</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2026%20ACSR%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 26 ACSR 269</a> and
<u>Creevey v. DCT</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19 ACSR 456.</a>  
<P>

5	I accept the submission that the onus is squarely on the company to satisfy
the Court that continuance in administration is in
the interests of the
creditors.  The views of the creditors themselves is of some importance.  It
seems to me, however, that the
views of the 80 percent of creditors relied on
for the company must be assessed having regard to the circumstance that, while
they
were notified of the administration, they were not notified of the
pendency of winding up proceedings, and they were not, so far
as the evidence
goes, squarely given a choice as to whether they preferred administration or
winding up.  So far as the evidence
goes, they were simply advised of
administration and, perhaps unsurprisingly, were in those circumstances
prepared to give their
proxies to the administrators.  The one creditor who, on
the evidence, plainly does know of the alternatives, plainly is pursuing
the
winding up alternative.
<P>

6	This Court, in winding up proceedings, has acted on a general principle that
liquidators should not be chosen by the directors
or other principals of the
company.  It is considered to be in the interests of creditors that someone
entirely independent undertake
that role.  There is no evidence as to the
complete independence of the administrators, although it was asserted from the
Bar Table
that they were independent, and had no prior connection with the
company or its principals.
<P>

7	Even if this is so, however the selection by directors of the person who is
to have the responsibility to investigate possible
breaches of the law is
against the policy of the Court.  That policy is not itself given weight in
s.440A; but as I understand it,
one basis of the policy is that it is
considered in the interests of creditors that someone completely independent
have this role.
 The history of this matter, and the timing of the various
steps apparently taken by the directors of the company in response to
steps
taken by this creditor, give further reasons for being concerned about the
directors being able to choose who is to have the
responsibility of
administering the company.
<P>

8	It seems to me there is nothing in the proposal for an arrangement for a
small dividend to creditors which suggests that this
arrangement could better
be negotiated by the administrators than by a liquidator, if this is the best
that is available for creditors.
<P>

9	For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the requirements of s.440A(2) of
the Corporations Law are made out, and I refuse the
adjournment.  In those
circumstances, as I understand it, no other opposition is raised to the making
of a winding up order, and
I propose to make such an order. 
<P>

10	I make Orders 1 and 2 in the summons.
<P>

11	I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

12	I refer the matter to the Registrar for the selection of the liquidator.
