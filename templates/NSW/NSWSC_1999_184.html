<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   In this matter the plaintiff, by notice of motion filed on 5
February 1999 seeks an order pursuant to s6(4) of the
Testators and Family
Maintenance and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act 1916</a>, varying the provisions of an
order made by Justice Cohen on 12 September 1985 pursuant to which provision
was made for the maintenance
and advancement of the plaintiff out of the estate
of her late husband Isaac Rutkiewitz . Under that will, in the events which
have
happened, the only benefit which the plaintiff received was an annuity of
$3,120 per annum, indexed in accordance with the consumers
price index.
<P>

2	By the orders, provision was made by substituting for that benefit which the
plaintiff received under the will, namely an annuity,
a life interest in the
property, 402 Ithaca Road, Elizabeth Bay, a legacy of $20,000 and a life estate
in residue. The remainder
interests were held upon the trusts of the will for
the grandchildren, or in one case a child of the testator.
<P>

3	The order provided that the trustee was required, at the request of the
plaintiff's widow, to sell the Ithaca Road property:
<P>

	and purchase such house. home unit or dwelling or right of accommodation in a
retirement or convalescent home unit as the plaintiff
should choose, to be held
upon the same trust and to be sold at the further request of the plaintiff on
the same terms.
<P>

4	It was further provided that any part of the proceeds of sale not so applied
would be held upon trust for the plaintiff for life,
and of course thereafter
would go in accordance with the will.
<P>

5	The provision of the will was contained in Order 4 which provided as
follows:
<P>

	In the event of the acquisition of any unit for accommodation in a retirement
or convalescent home or village requiring the payment
of capital which is not
repayable, the trustee is empowered and required at the request of the
plaintiff to extend for that purpose
up to one third of the proceeds of sale.
Including that part of the proceeds which is invested.
<P>

6	The evidence shows that the Ithaca road property was sold, and another home
unit property purchased in Diamond Bay Road Vaucluse.
That property has now
been sold for, I was told without objection, a sum of $235,000, giving as I
understand it, a net figure of
about $220,000. The plaintiff is 82 years of
age, and she is not in particularly good health.  She has been admitted to the
Sir Moses
Montefiore Jewish Home at Woollahra as a permanent resident in hostel
accommodation. She wishes to remain in the Eastern Suburbs,
remaining close to
a Jewish community with which she is familiar.
<P>

7	The income available to her from a part pension and from her life estate is
not sufficient to enable her to pay the costs of accommodation
in the home.  On
the evidence which is somewhat difficult to understand there is a short fall of
about $24,000 a year. The trustee
has provided to the Home by way of interest
free loans an amount of $75,500 dollars or a little more, being one third of
the net
proceeds of sale. This would be in accordance with the obligation of
the trustee to do so at the request of the plaintiff, pursuant
to Order 4,
which I have set out.
<P>

8	In addition to that the trustee would have been obliged to pay one third of
any difference received between the sale moneys from
the sale of Ithaca Road
and the purchase moneys paid on the purchase of the Vaucluse unit, but that
does not really arise.
<P>

9	The order which is sought by the plaintiff is a variation of the wording of
Order 4, (1) so that there would be a requirement
to expend up to one third of
the proceeds of sale, not only towards the acquisition of accommodation, but
towards the payment of
any annual or other fees or outgoings in respect of that
accommodation, and (2) if that is not sufficient to pay the annual fees
or
outgoings when taken together with the income received by the plaintiff, then
to pay any excess amount out of the corpus of the
estate.
<P>

10	The effect of what is sought would be that so far as there were any moneys
in the estate, the trustee would be required to use
them for the purposes of
maintaining the plaintiff in the particular home where she wishes to live. In
saying that I am not suggesting
that her wish to live in the home where she is
presently accommodated is in any way an improper wish.
<P>

11	The other order sought by the plaintiff is a declaration that upon the true
construction of Order 2 of the original orders the
words:
<P>

	And from the proceeds purchase such other house home unit or other dwelling or
unit or right of accommodation in a retirement or
convalescent home or
village.
<P>

	means not only to pay the capital sum required for that acquisition at the
time, but also any continuing annual fees or out-goings
in respect of that
acquisition or right of accommodation.
<P>

12	As far as the first matter is concerned, namely the claim under s 6(4) of
the Testators Family Maintenance Act, it is my view
that there is no power to
make that order. This is clearly established by the case of<b> <cite>re Denis
Molloy</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1928/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] NSWStRp 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2028%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20546" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 28 SR (NSW) 546.</a> The only cases put forward by the
plaintiff's counsel in support of his contention are the cases of <b><cite>re
William Butler deceased</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1923/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1923] NSWStRp 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281923%29%2023%20SR%28NSW%29%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1923), 23 SR(NSW) 540</a>,  and<b> <cite>re
Dekantzow</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%2088%20SR%20NSW%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968), 88 SR NSW 437..</a>  Neither of those cases involved
an order for an increase in benefits, but rather involved applications by the
trustee for the variation.
The first case was discussed by Harvey CJ in Equity
in re <b><cite>Molloy</cite></b> but he considered the wording of s 6(4) of the
Act was such that it did not allow applications by the original applicant for
any
increase in benefits.  As was explained in <b><cite>Molloy</cite></b>, the
last sentence of the relevant subsection supports this result in that notice of
motion for a variation is required to be served
on all persons taking under the
order sought be rescinded or altered. In other words the persons who obtained a
benefit under the
original order were obviously thought to be those persons
whose rights would be affected on such an application. Re Molloy has stood
the
test of time for many years and there is no basis on which this court should
disturb it. The same result has been arrived at
under the Victorian legislation
in the case of <b><cite>Re Bishop deceased</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1952/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1952] VicLawRp 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%20VLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1952] VLR 543.</a>
<P>

13	That disposes of the first order sought apart from the argument of Mr
Willmot, for the plaintiff, that it was not really an increase
in benefit which
was being sought but rather what was originally intended. To some extent that
goes to the construction of the order,
but insofar as it goes outside that in
my view there is no basis for that submission.  
<P>

14	As far as the declaration is concerned, while I was taken to the judgment it
seems to me that is irrelevant as the order itself
is quite clear.  In saying
that I should explain that  the formal order which no doubt was taken out, is
not before the court and
the parties are content that the judge's notes which
are in evidence be taken to be the orders.  Order 2 quite clearly relates to
the purchase of a home unit or right of accommodation.  Order 4 quite clearly
relates to a payment being required for the acquisition
of such right of
accommodation. On no basis can it thought that the proper construction of those
orders meant that the capital sum
which the trustee was entitled and obliged to
pay for such acquisition was also to be made available for the expenses
involved in
living in the accommodation acquired. That disposes of both of the
claims.
<P>

15	I should conclude by saying that these matters are always difficult because
one cannot help feeling some sympathy towards the
widow.  However, the fact is
that the relief which she seeks is not available to her. In those circumstance
the notice of motion
should be dismissed.
<P>

16	On the question of costs, counsel for the defendant says that there was
really never any basis for the application and that it
was bound to fail.
While I consider that is really correct, I am not prepared to think that the
solicitor or counsel for the plaintiff
just proceeded with a hopeless case
knowing it was hopeless.  
<P>

17	I do not think that the plaintiff should have any order for costs out of the
estate but I do not think that she should be ordered
to pay the costs of the
defendant.  What the defendant seeks though is an order that those costs be
paid out of the income of the
estate rather than the corpus of the estate which
would have the effect of the widow bearing them rather than being shared
between
the life tenant and the remaindermen on the basis that the income would
be slightly decreased.  I have wavered on this but consider
the responsibility
should be shared.
<P>

18	No order as to costs for the plaintiff.  I order that the costs of the
defendant on an indemnity basis be paid out of the estate
of the deceased.
