MASTER MALPASS
<P>

WEDNESDAY 15 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>20101/1999</u>	<u>DRAGO JAMBRECINA v PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY (IN
LIQUIDATION) &amp; ANOR.</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	An earlier hearing in these proceedings took place on 13 July
1999.  Reserved judgment was delivered on 29 July 1999.
<P>

2  	There were two Notices of Motion before the court.  One had been
brought by the plaintiff (for leave to sue the defendants).
 The other had been
brought by the defendants (seeking relief pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 13</a> r 5 and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 15</a> r 26
of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</u> 1970</a>). An order was made, that the
plaintiff's Statement of Claim be struck out.  The plaintiff was given leave to
file an Amended Statement
of Claim within twenty eight days.  The remaining
matters were stood over generally.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff has filed an Amended Statement of Claim.  The
defendants have filed an Amended Notice of Motion.  Similar relief
(to that
sought in respect of the Statement of Claim) is now sought in respect of the
Amended Statement of Claim.  The plaintiff
renewed his application for leave to
sue the defendants.
<P>

4  	The hearing took place on 6 December 1999.  The same evidence was
placed before the court.  Similar arguments were put.  Both
sides have relied
on written submissions supplemented by oral argument.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff appeared in person.  He has had the conduct of the
proceedings on his own behalf.  He has drafted the Amended
Statement of Claim,
without legal assistance.
<P>

6  	The Amended Statement of Claim consists of four numbered
sections.  The section numbered 1 pleads due incorporation of both
defendants.
The section numbered 2 pleads the mortgage.  The first of the sections numbered
3 pleads conditions of mortgage.
<P>

7  	The second of the sections numbered 3 proceeds over three pages
and comprises many unnumbered paragraphs.  The first page has
5 paragraphs.
Certain of them appeared in the original Statement of Claim (there are three
paragraphs which contain allegations of
delay in settlement in respect of three
properties and make the allegation of non compliance with unspecified mortgage
conditions).
 Certain of them constitute new matter (there is material relating
to two earlier proceedings involving the parties).  The second
and third pages
contain material which appears under the heading "<u>Particulars of
Negligence</u> and <u>Professional Misconduct</u>" ( (a) to (i) thereof set out
alleged incidents of breach of "the mortgage <u>condition</u>" ).  The third
page also contains material which appears under the heading "<u>Particulars of
Losses</u> and <u>Damages</u>".  The Amended Statement of Claim concludes with
a claim for damages.  
<P>

8  	There are two defendants.  Generally speaking, the allegations
are made at large as against both defendants.  Whilst the case
has been
conducted on the basis that the claim was founded on breach of conditions
contained in the mortgage, the Amended Statement
of Claim contains material
which suggests reliance on other causes of action.  There is material appearing
under the heading "<u>Particulars of Negligence</u> and <u>Professional
Misconduct</u>" which mentions "The above breeches and neglegents".  There is
material appearing under the heading "<u>Particulars of Losses</u> and
<u>Damages</u>" which mentions "acting in breech of duty as mortgagee" and
"being negligent as the mortgagee".  In many instances, the allegations
of
breach do not identify the relevant conditions.  In many instances, they do not
seem to be referrable to any of the conditions
identified in the first of the
paragraphs number 3.  The material does not identify any duty of care.
<P>

9  	The Amended Statement of Claim does not comply with the pleading
rules.  The pleading rules require that a pleading shall contain,
and contain
only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party
relies, but not the evidence by which those
facts are to be proved (Pt 15 r 7).
The Amended Statement of Claim falls well short of these requirements.  It is
lacking in material
facts.  It abounds with matters of evidence and what may be
described as commentary and conclusion (much of which is lacking in relevance).
In a pleading sense it is embarrassing.
<P>

10  	A function of a pleading is to define and narrow the issues in
dispute between the parties.  The Amended Statement of Claim
would not assist
the performance of that function.  Indeed, if pleaded to, it would produce the
converse.  I do not consider that
a defendant should be required to plead to
it.
<P>

11  	I am satisfied that the Amended Statement of Claim should be
struck out.  The plaintiff has not made application for leave
to file further
amended process.  For completeness, I should add that, if such an application
had been made, I would not have been
disposed to accede to it.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff has been previously warned that he may have had
his last opportunity to present the case he wishes to propound.
 The
opportunity has been squandered.  In my view, there is a lack of utility in
providing any further opportunity.  It would be
likely to see further costs
being thrown away.
<P>

13  	It appears that the mortgage was transferred by the second
defendant to the first defendant in 1990.  The relevant allegations
made by the
plaintiff relate to events that have happened since the transfer.  There
appears to be no basis for any claim against
the second defendant.
<P>

14  	In 1992, there were proceedings involving the first defendant
and the plaintiff.  They were commenced by Summons and there
were no pleadings.
The first defendant sought possession of certain properties.  In the present
proceedings allegations are made
in respect of three of those properties.
<P>

15  	In the earlier proceedings, the material relied on by the now
plaintiff ventilated the following matters:-
<P>

(a)	That the mortgagee had charged higher rates of 
<P>

interest than those to which it was entitled;
<P>

(b)	That the proceeds of sale of certain properties were 
<P>

applied to reduce principal rather than reducing arrears of interest; and
<P>

(c)	That there were delays in the settlement of certain 
<P>

properties.
<P>

It is sought to ventilate inter alia these three matters in the present
proceedings.
<P>

16  	The earlier proceedings were settled.  There were consent Short
Minutes of Order.  There was a judgment for possession.
<P>

17  	The defendants have argued that the plaintiff's claim is liable
to be defeated by the principles of res judicata, issue estoppel
and what was
decided in <u>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR
589.</a>  There may well be force in certain of these submissions.  The plaintiff
has asserted that some of the matters now relied on went
to the issue of
default.  It may be that some of them could not be an answer to the claim for
possession (some may have had relevance
in the event of a taking of an
account).  However, for present purposes, it is unnecessary to reach any final
view on these matters.
 There are more fundamental problems.
<P>

18  	The plaintiff's material and submissions reveal that what he
seeks to propound appears to be misconceived and without substance.
 There does
not appear to be any arguable claim.  Further, any claim for relief founded on
negligence is statute barred.
<P>

19  	I order that the Amended Statement of Claim be struck out.  I
dismiss the plaintiff's Notice of Motion (the authorities make
it clear that
such an application can only succeed where the claim has a solid foundation and
gives rise to a serious dispute). 
The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
proceedings (including the costs of the Notices of Motion).  The exhibits may
be returned.
