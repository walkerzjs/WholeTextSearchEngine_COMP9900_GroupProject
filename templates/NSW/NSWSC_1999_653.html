<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

(On application for bail)</center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an application for bail by
Bruce Alan Claxton who was successful this morning in obtaining an adjournment
of the hearing
of the appeal against his conviction for receiving, following
his trial by a jury, for which he was sentenced to penal servitude
for a
minimum term of one year commencing on 3 October 1998 with an additional term
of one year.  Unless the conviction is set aside,
the minimum term of the
sentence will expire on 2 October this year, in approximately three months
time; and the adjournment having
been granted, it is unlikely that his appeal
will be heard before then.  He is also serving the balance of an additional
term pursuant
to an order of the Parole Board which expires on 19 September
1999.  The applicant tells me that he has been "led to believe", whatever
that
might mean, that if he is granted bail on this matter the Parole Board will
re-convene to again assess his eligibility for parole,
and he may be successful
or he may not.
<P>

2   	The applicant, having been convicted, there is no
presumption in favour of bail:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 8(2)(a)(iii)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a>(2)(b) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/" class="autolink_findacts">Bail
Act 1978</a></i></b>, but he may nevertheless be granted bail: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13.</a>  However, as
he is an appellant to this Court, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s30aa.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 30AA</a> applies and bail will not be granted
unless it is established <i>"that special or exceptional circumstances
exist"</i> justifying the grant of bail.  Special and exceptional
circumstances, it has been held, can include the fact that if bail is not
granted the whole or a substantial part of the sentence will have been served
before the appeal is determined.  
<P>

3   	It has also been held that special or exceptional
circumstances may be found in a ground of appeal which is certain to succeed:
see<b><i> R -v- Wilson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 1</a> at 6, <b><i>R -v- Lance
Smith</i></b>, (Hunt CJ at CL, 18 May 1993).
<P>

4   	This is certainly not an appeal where the prospects of
success can be regarded as high.  It is true that the reason for the
adjournment of the appeal this morning was in no way the fault of the
applicant, the reason being that counsel assigned by the Legal
Aid Commission
to assess his prospects of success in the appeal has not yet attended to the
matter.  There is a further consideration,
namely, that he has been informed
that his daughter, Bianca, was raped over the weekend.  Bianca is seven years
old and lives with
the applicant's wife from whom he is separated and who has
or is about to commence divorce proceedings.  He wishes to render her
support.

<P>

5   	Even if he was granted bail, it would be a couple of weeks
before the Parole Board could be re-convened, even if it were then
minded to
release him on further parole.  On the other hand he may be entitled, and I
express no view on this, but he may be entitled
to compassionate leave if he
needs to visit his daughter in these circumstances.  I do accept that special
or exceptional circumstances
exist in that if not granted bail he will have
served virtually the whole sentence before the appeal is heard, but that does
not
necessarily entitle him to bail.
<P>

6   	It then becomes necessary to consider the criteria in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a>
including under subs (1)(c)(iii) the likelihood that he will or will not commit
any further offences whilst at liberty on bail.
<P>

7   	The applicant has an appalling record, particularly for
offences of this nature.  He has an extensive record of offences of
dishonesty
between 1970 and 1984 when he was sentenced to twelve years penal servitude on
three counts of assault and rob.
<P>

8   	Since 1993, there have been a number of offences involving
driving unregistered and uninsured motor vehicles whilst unlicensed,
but there
have also been a number of dishonesty offences.  
<P>

9   	On 20 January 1994 at Windsor Local Court he was convicted
of receiving.  On 15 December 1995 at the Redfern Local Court he
was convicted
of goods in custody.  On 5 March 1996 at the Wollongong District Court he was
convicted of larceny of a motor vehicle
and possess implements capable of
entering a conveyance.
<P>

10   	On 15 April 1996 at the Wollongong District Court he was
convicted of two counts of receiving, two of assault and one of attempt
to
steal.  On 19 April 1996 at the Blacktown Local Court he was convicted of
stealing.  On the last mentioned matter, he was sentenced
to a fixed term of
imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 4 September 1996, so that he was
released on 3 September 1997.
<P>

11   	The offence of which he has been convicted and which is
the subject of the appeal is alleged to have been committed between
18 and 27
September 1997, some three weeks after his release from custody.  In those
circumstances, I would be very concerned that,
if released on bail, he would
commit further offences whilst on bail, and I would regard those offences as
serious because although
they do not involve physical violence or sexual
assault, they do disrupt the lives of people whose vehicles and other goods are
taken
or removed.
<P>

12   	I may have been persuaded to grant bail if I, on a brief
assessment, considered he had substantial grounds for appeal but
I cannot find
any.  In written submissions filed by him and, obviously, with legal advice and
subject to the consideration that if
legal representation is granted, the
grounds of appeal may well be amended or expanded, he relies on what appears to
be three main
grounds; firstly, that the trial judge failed to adequately
explain to the jury the onus of proof and the elements of the charge
of
receiving, secondly, that the directions on circumstantial evidence were
inadequate, and thirdly, that the Crown failed to provide
adequate proof that
the horse float in question had been stolen.  
<P>

13   	I can see absolutely no deficiency in the trial judge's
directions to the jury in relation to the onus of proof, the elements
of the
charge of receiving, or circumstantial evidence; they appear to be in what
might be called the standard forms, and are more
than adequate.
<P>

14   	In relation to the proposed ground that the Crown failed
to provide adequate proof that the article was stolen, there was
considerable
evidence from the owner of the horse float in question as to distinguishing
features of the item that had been stolen,
and she identified these items on
the horse float which Mrs Zaiter had purchased from the appellant.
<P>

15   	I do not regard the grounds of appeal as having any strong
or reasonably strong prospects of success.  In all the circumstances,
the
application is dismissed and bail is refused.
<P>

16   	I order that the hearing of the appeal be expedited and
the matter is to be placed in the first available callover.
<P>
