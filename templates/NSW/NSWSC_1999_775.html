<b>55045/1997 - LAVENDER VIEW REGENCY PTY LIMITED  v  NORTH SYDNEY COUNCIL (NO
2)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	On 14 July 1999 I held that the plaintiff was entitled to
judgment in the sum of $224,321.51, being the then agreed amount
for costs
wasted in respect of certain Class IV proceedings in the Land and Environment
Court together with agreed interest to 1
June 1999, and interest thereon from 1
June 1999 to 14 July 1999.  The defendant agreed to pay this amount
unconditionally, in the
sense that the judgment was to include this amount
irrespective of any other findings. I ordered that costs and interest be
reserved
for future agreement or argument.  Subsequently, it was agreed that
the additional interest was $2,704.15, so that on the figures
then agreed,
there would have been judgment for the plaintiff, inclusive of interest to the
date of judgment, in the sum of $227,025.66.
 However, when the matter was
mentioned on 30 July 1999 I was informed that the parties may well agree on
another figure but, on
2 August 1999, I was informed that the agreed figure is
$227,025.66.   The remaining issue is what order should be made in relation
to
costs, each party contending that the other should pay its costs of the
proceedings, in so far as a costs' order has not been
made previously.  It must
be unusual to find a case in which a defendant, which has suffered judgment in
such a sum, seeks an order
that the apparently successful plaintiff should not
only be deprived of a costs' order but should pay the apparently unsuccessful
defendant's costs.  Accordingly, the particular circumstances of this case
require closer review than might otherwise be necessary
in deciding the
question of costs.
<P>

2   	I shall assume the reader has access to a copy of my first
judgment, and I shall incorporate the detail of certain matters
by reference to
the paragraphs in which I considered them in that judgment.
<P>

3   	The proceedings, in which the plaintiff sued the defendant
seeking to recover some $64m for the defendant's alleged negligence,
were
commenced on 25 September 1997 and, on 19 June 1998, an order was made that the
issue of liability be heard prior to that of
damages: paragraph 10. This was a
course to which the parties consented. On 3 August 1998 the parties resolved
the former issue in
terms of consent Short Minutes of Order: paragraphs 10 and
11, which provided that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the
proceedings to date on the issue of liability.
<P>

4   	On 8 March 1999 I commenced the inquiry into the amount of
damages the plaintiff had sustained.  That hearing continued for
six days and,
thereafter, an application was made by the plaintiff for leave to re-open,
which was opposed and which I granted. 
Subsequently, the matter was mentioned
on various occasions.
<P>

5   	There were two substantial issues litigated.  The first was
whether the defendant's agreed negligence was causative of any
damages to the
plaintiff.  The second was the amount of such damages.  I have set forth the
issues in paragraphs 13, 14, 16, 19 and
20, and the findings for which the
defendant contended in paragraph 18.
<P>

6   	In paragraph 360 I stated my conclusions on causation,
which were, in essence, that the plaintiff had failed to prove that
the
defendant's conceded negligence was causative of the damages claimed by the
plaintiff.  It was unnecessary for me to make detailed
findings on the various
amounts, which would have been payable by the defendant if the plaintiff's case
in one of its various manifestations
had succeeded, because the expert
accountants reached substantial agreement on the figures, which would be
applicable depending on
my findings on causation and several other matters.
However, there can be no doubt that the parties expended considerable sums in
retaining those experts and in having them reach agreement.  Whilst this
exercise resulted in a considerable saving of time in Court
it was one for
which the parties will still have to pay appropriate fees.  Of course, the
experts had prepared witness statements
and, notwithstanding the substantial
measure of agreement as to relevant figures, each was required for
cross-examination.  It was
necessary for me to consider their evidence  and to
reach certain conclusions in relation to it.
<P>

7   	In paragraph 12 I noted that whilst the plaintiff had
initially made a claim for damages for loss of opportunity, that had
not been
pressed save in a very limited way, and that whilst the defendant had pleaded
failure by the plaintiff to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate its loss and
contributory negligence, neither of those allegations was pursued.  I also
noted in that paragraph
the steps taken by the experts.
<P>

8   	One matter in relation to damages, which I was called upon
to decide, was the rate at which interest was payable.  The plaintiff
contended
that it was the amount payable on shareholders' funds, as had happened, and the
defendant submitted that it should be at
bank interest rates. I held that the
plaintiff's view was correct.  Another issue between the experts was whether
one should deduct
the value of the land, as the plaintiff's expert contended,
or deduct a profit or loss to be achieved from the development, as the
defendant's expert contended.  I determined this issue favourably to the
defendant. The amount agreed, if I had accepted the plaintiff's
expert's
methodology, was considerably more than the amount agreed by accepting the
defendant's expert's apprach.
<P>

9   	On the basis of those determinations the experts agreed on
the amounts to which the plaintiff was entitled, which are set out
in
paragraphs 369, 370, 374 and 375.  Whilst the plaintiff originally claimed
damages of some $64m, after the loss of opportunity
claim was abandoned and in
the light of my findings, the maximum amount to which it was entitled was
$24,840,000 and the figure for
wasted costs, and the minimum amount was the
figure for wasted costs.  There were several intermediate positions.
<P>

10   	There was some dispute in the written submissions on costs
as to how agreement was reached on the issue of wasted costs. 
As this was the
only amount on which the plaintiff succeeded, and as that success was based on
a concession made by the defendant,
it becomes necessary to look at the matter
with some care.  Whilst the defendant was apparently prepared to make the
concession on
the hearing, the plaintiff was unable to satisfy it or prove to
the Court what part, of a large amount claimed for costs, was attributable
to
wasted costs.  Mr Walker, Tp.330, repeated the concession but said there was no
evidence of the amount.  On the third day of the
hearing Mr Tobias said that
the only remaining matter was "to separate out" those legal costs, Tpp.470-1,
and that if there was any
disagreement the plaintiff would seek leave to
re-open.  I stated that I would reserve the plaintiff's right to do so and, at
Tpp.472-3,
Mr Tobias said, with which I respectfully agree, that he found it
very odd that that issue "had not been susceptible to agreement
between the
solicitors", and that if there was no agreement the Court would have to decide
it.  By the fifth day Mr Tobias stated
that the principal sum had been
calculated, but interest had not.  Ultimately I was provided with the agreed
figure, which I set
forth in my judgment.  On 30 July 1999 I was informed that
the solicitors for the plaintiff may have made an error, to which attention
had
been drawn by the solicitors for the defendant, and I directed that I be
informed of the agreed figure by 10 am on 2 August 1999.
<P>

11   	I have dealt with this matter at some length because one
of the plaintiff's complaints is that the defendant, although conceding
the
amount, made no attempt to settle at least that issue.  There are two
compelling answers to that submission.  Firstly, the defendant
was not obliged
to settle anything, even if there was a concession, if the plaintiff could not
satisfy it what the amount was.  The
"in principle" concession, from which the
defendant did not waiver, could only be applicable to an amount the plaintiff
could establish.
 Secondly, the plaintiff had not established the amount during
the hearing, nor, having regard to what transpired on 30 July 1999,
by that
date.  I said then, and I repeat, that I find this failure extraordinary.
However, for present purposes it is sufficient
to note how the matter
progressed to show that the plaintiff's complaints, in this regard, are without
substance.
<P>

12   	I should also note that by its Defence the defendant not
only denied the entitlement to damages, but also asserted that if
the plaintiff
had suffered loss and damage, and that if the defendant was in breach, the loss
and damage was not caused by the defendant's
breach.  Therefore, at all times,
the defendant expressly drew attention to the fact that causation was an issue.
Certain submissions
of the plaintiff suggested that causation was not really in
issue or was a subsidiary submission to mitigation.  I reject such submissions.
Causation was clearly in issue on the pleadings and the case was fought on that
basis.  Mitigation only became relevant, as the plaintiff
conceded, if the
defendant failed on the causation point.  Further, it was conceded that the
defendant, which bore the onus on mitigation,
had filed no evidence in support
of that issue.
<P>

13   	It was common ground on the hearing of the costs' argument
that notwithstanding its admission of liability, the defendant
had made no
formal or informal offer of compromise, and nor had the plaintiff.  However, as
the figure for wasted costs had not been
formulated, the defendant, if this was
otherwise a valid point, could hardly be blamed for not having done so.
<P>

14   	The issues are whether the defendant should pay the
plaintiff's costs of the inquiry into damages, or whether the plaintiff
should
pay the defendant's costs of it, or whether there should be some division of
costs based on the degree of success each party
achieved.
<P>

<b>A General Overview</b>
<P>

15   	The essential issues for determination on the inquiry into
damages were, firstly, whether the defendant's admitted negligence
was
causative of damage to the plaintiff and, if it was, the amount of such
damages.  If the first issue was decided adversely to
the plaintif it did not
mean that the second issue did not have to be decided although it became
irrelevant for my orders.  Generally,
however, it is desirable for the Court at
first instance to decide as many matters as possible, so that if the Court of
Appeal considers
the finding is wrong, it can make final orders.  Those issues
occupied all but a few minutes of the hearing time.  The very short
time taken
on the wasted costs' issue was brought about by the plaintiff's inability to
say what the amount was. 
<P>

16   	The second issue involved the disputes between the experts
and, whilst as a matter of law I accepted the plaintiff's position
so far as
interest was concerned, in so far as there was a conflict between the experts
as to the correct methodology to be adopted,
I preferred that of the
defendant's expert: paragraph 367.  Accordingly, even if the plaintiff had been
successful on the causation
issue, it would only have recovered damages,
(subject to recovering interest on the principal sums in the manner for which
it contended),
based on the amounts put forward by the defendant's expert.  I
do not think it could have been said in those circumstances that the
plaintiff
would not have been entitled to its costs of the inquiry because, on that
hypothesis, it would have established causation
and thus an entitlement to
substantial damages.
<P>

17   	The issues to which I have just referred were the issues
fought at trial.  The amount recovered by the plaintiff was conceded
by the
defendant.  It may be that it was not conceded until the hearing, but in the
overall context of a claim for many millions
of dollars, that does not seem to
me to be a matter of any significance.  The fact remains that the time occupied
in coming to that
concession and the amount which was payable, in the context
of this litigation, was minute.
<P>

18   	None-the-less the plaintiff has recovered a not
insubstantial sum, although, in the context of its basic claim, it pales into
some insignificance.  It is the recovery of this sum, which founds the
plaintiff's claim that the defendant should pay its costs.
 Unless that amount
had been recovered it is difficult to see what argument the plaintiff could
have put forward in support of its
submission that the defendant should pay its
costs.  Indeed, it is difficult to see what argument it could have put forward
in opposition
to the defendant's submission that it pay the defendant's
costs.
<P>

<b>The Relevant Principles</b>
<P>

19   	The very wide discretion the Court has in relation to
ordering costs is enshrined in s.76 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 4(1)</a> provides that the powers and discretions of the Court under that
section shall be exercised subject to and in accordance with that
Part, and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 11</a> states that if the Court makes any order as to costs, it shall, subject
to this Part:-
<P>

<b>".. order that the costs follow the event, except where it appears to the
court that some other order should be made as to the whole
or any part of the
costs".</b>
<P>

Prima facie the relevant event is that the plaintiff has recovered judgment in
contested proceedings. (In this regard it will be
remembered that the defendant
remains liable to pay the costs of establishing liability.) The amount for
which it recovered judgment
exceeds by a substantial degree the amount set
forth in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 33(2)(e)</a> for proceedings commenced between 1 July 1993 and 1
October 1997, in so far as that is a relevant consideration, and, once again,
in so far as it is relevant, it also exceeds the amount referred to in sub-rule
(f)(ii).  Therefore, the plaintiff would not have
been put in a position,
pursuant to that rule, of not being entitled to payment of its costs unless it
appeared to the Court that
it had sufficient reason for commencing or
continuing the proceedings.
<P>

20   	I should mention, merely for the purpose of disposing of
the point, that there was no suggestion in this case that either
party had
conducted itself in a way which would disentitle it to costs, which it may
otherwise recover.  
<P>

21   	Therefore, the short, although perhaps not simple,
question is whether the almost total failure by the plaintiff, that failure
being total on the principal issue of causation, and the success arising by
virtue of the concession, leads to the conclusion that
the plaintiff is
none-the-less entitled to its costs from the defendant, or is obliged to pay
the defendant's costs.
<P>

<b>The Submissions</b>
<P>

22   	It was submitted for the plaintiff that it has recovered
"substantial damages", and that the defendant "took none of the steps
available
to avoid the necessity for a hearing, despite the ultimate consent finding that
it had been negligent".
<P>

23   	The steps to which reference is made, presumably, are the
making of an offer of compromise either formally or informally.
 It is
necessary to put that submission into context.  Let it be assumed that the
defendant had made an offer of compromise of, e.g.
$250,000, because it took
the view that that covered the only amount for which it considered it was
liable, being its assessment
of the amount of wasted costs.  It cannot, in my
respectful opinion, be inferred that the plaintiff would have accepted that in
circumstances
where its claim was for the various amounts to which I have
referred.  Although, on its best case as I determined the matter, it
would have
been entitled to some $24m, on its best case as propounded by its expert, it
would have been entitled to considerably
more.  In my opinion, the only
reasonable inference is that the plaintiff would not have compromised for so
low a figure.   It would,
of course, have been very useful from the defendant's
point of view for it to have made such an offer, because that would have
founded
a claim for indemnity costs.  Therefore, I consider that any attempt by
the defendant to settle on the basis of the amount for which
it was prepared to
concede liability must have failed and the case would still have proceeded.
The parties were too far apart.  No
evidence was called that the plaintiff
would have settled for so low an amount.  Further, I do not consider that a
party should be,
generally speaking, penalised by a costs' order because it
does not attempt to settle the proceedings.  In this case the defendant
established its defence based on causation and, throughout the hearing, was
asserting that whilst it was prepared to make the concession,
the plaintiff had
not established to its satisfaction or sought to prove the amount payable
pursuant to it.
<P>

24   	The plaintiff's submissions then responded to the central
submission for the defendant, namely that it is generally accepted
that the
phrase "follow the event" refers to the practical result of a particular claim:
<b>Windsurfing International Inc v Petit</b> (1987) AIPC 37861.  I consider
that is essentially correct. The defendant's submission was that the
application of that test led
to the result that as its principal contention was
accepted, and the plaintiff's contentions were rejected, the practical result
of the claim was that the defendant won.  The submissions continued:-
<P>

<b>"5.	The defendant's principal position was that no substantial losses have
been suffered by the plaintiff as the plaintiff would have,
absent any
negligence of the defendant, acted in the same way as it actually did with the
negligence.</b>
<P>

<b>  6.	Virtually all of the time at the hearing was devoted to determining
what the plaintiff would have done absent the negligence
of the
defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>  7.	The Court accepted the defendant's principal contention and held that
the plaintiff had failed to establish that it suffered
any substantial loss as
a result of the negligence of the defendant (see paragraph 362 of the
judgment)."</b>
<P>

25   	The plaintiff submitted that it has recovered substantial
damages and referred to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 33(2)(e).</a>  It submitted that it is not
the law that, simply because the amount recovered is small compared to the
amount claimed, the plaintiff
is not entitled to recover costs.
<P>

26   	So much may be accepted.  However, in each case it is
necessary for the Court to look at why the plaintiff only recovered
a small
amount and, if there are various components of damage, decide whether some
special order should be made apportioning the
costs on the basis of those on
which the plaintiff succeeded and those on which it failed. In considering that
the Court must take
a somewhat broad brush approach.  There are few cases in
which it can be said one party has been wholly successful and one has
completely
failed. It is, in this area of the law, difficult to generalise.
For example in this case the plaintiff succeeded on the limited
issues of the
rate of interest and wasted costs.  Each case will depend upon its particular
circumstances: <b>Oshlack v Richmond River Council</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%20578" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 578</a> and
<b>Fexuto Pty Limited v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Limited &amp; Ors (No 3)</b>
(Young J - 10 December 1998 - unreported).  In <b>Oshlack</b>, at p.591, McHugh
J said:-
<P>

<b>"Although the statutory discretion is broadly stated, it is not unqualified.
It clearly cannot be exercised capriciously.  Importantly,
the discretion must
be exercised judicially in accordance with established principle and factors
directly connected with the litigation.
 In this manner, the law has gradually
developed principles to guide the proper exercise of the discretion and, in
some cases, to
highlight extraneous considerations which, if taken into
account, will cause the exercise of the discretion to miscarry.  Consistent
with the aim of justice, the law could not have developed otherwise.  As Mason
CJ said in <i>Latoudis v Casey</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 534</a> at 541:</b>
<P>

<b>`it does not follow that any attempt to formulate a principle or a guideline
according to which the discretion should be exercised
would constitute a fetter
upon the discretion not intended by the legislature.  Indeed, a refusal to
formulate a principle or guideline
can only lead to exercises of discretion
which are seen to be inconsistent, a result which would not have been
contemplated by the
legislature with any degree of equanimity.'</b>
<P>

<b>By far the most important factor which courts have viewed as guiding the
exercise of the costs discretion is the result of the litigation.
 A successful
litigant is generally entitled to an award of costs.  As Devlin J said in
<i>Smeaton Hanscomb &amp; Co Ltd v Sasson I Setty, Son &amp; Co [No 2]</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%201%20WLR%201481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] 1 WLR 1481</a> at 1484, when setting aside an arbitrator's costs
award:</b>
<P>

<b>`the arbitrator is not directing his mind to one of the most, if not the
most, important of the elements which ought to affect his
discretion, namely
the result of the case.  Prima facie, a successful party is entitled to his
costs.  To deprive him of his costs
or to require him to pay a part of the
costs of the other side is an exceptional measure.'</b>
<P>

<b>The combined force of the sentiments recognised above by Mason CJ, regarding
the need for consistency in order to avoid injustice,
and by Devlin J,
regarding the most significant factor affecting the costs discretion, provides
the jurisprudential basis for the
important principle commonly referred to as
the `usual order as to costs'.</b>
<P>

<b>The expression the `usual order as to costs' embodies the important
principle that, subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful
party in
litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour.  The principle is
grounded in reasons of fairness and policy
and operates whether the successful
party is the plaintiff or the defendant.  Costs are not awarded to punish an
unsuccessful party.
 The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify
the successful party: <i>Latoudis </i>at 543, <i>Cachia v Hanes</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179
CLR 403</a> at 410.  If the litigation had not been brought, or defended, by the
unsuccessful party the successful party would not have incurred
the expense
which it did.  As between the parties, fairness dictates that the unsuccessful
party typically bears the liability for
the costs of the unsuccessful
litigation."</b>
<P>

In <b>Fexuto</b>, Young J  said:-
<P>

<b>"However, these matters only go to the ultimate question, and, as noted by
Bowen LJ at that page, a judge has got to look at the matter
globally and in
the circumstances of each case and make an order for costs that is fair and
reasonable after taking into account
the general guidelines."</b>
<P>

The particular circumstances applicable to this case are that the plaintiff
failed, save in so far as there was a concession and
on the question of the
rate of interest, and, accordingly the costs and expenses of the hearing and
its preparation were costs and
expenses it incurred and obliged the defendant
to incur in circumstances where it basically failed.
<P>

27   	The plaintiff nextly submitted that <b>Windsurfing</b>
does not assist the defendant as Waddell J referred with general approval to
decisions to the effect that in recent years the approach
has been that a
successful party should have the whole costs of the proceeding, including the
costs of an issue on which he has failed,
unless in respect of that issue the
successful party has "unfairly, improperly, or unnecessarily increased the
costs".  In my opinion,
his Honour acknowledged, in a passage to which I shall
refer, that in an appropriate case a costs' order may be moulded to reflect
the
degree of success on issues.
<P>

28   	In <b>Windsurfing</b> the defendants succeeded on the
claim and counter claim and sought an order that the plaintiffs pay the whole
of their costs.  The
plaintiffs submitted that, having regard to the fact that
they succeeded on several issues, the appropriate order should be that
they pay
fifty per cent or thereabouts of the defendants' costs.  
<P>

29   	His Honour referred to the predecessor to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 11</a>
and, at pp.37861-37862, said:-
<P>

<b>"It is, I think, probably generally accepted that the words `follow the
event' refer to the event of the claim or counter claim. 
However, it may be
noted that in other contexts similar words have been held to refer to the event
of distinct issues with the result
that the general costs went to the party who
on the whole succeeded in the action but that the other party got the costs of
separate
issues on which he succeeded."</b>
<P>

30   	His Honour referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <b>Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2 NSWLR 749</a> at p.809.  That
case, as I think did <b>Windsurfing</b>, involved far more complex and
inter-related issues than the present.  In saying that I am not to be taken as
suggesting that the
issue of causation was not complex, nor that the
calculation of damages did not raise difficulties.  But they were the two
issues,
which I was called on to decide, and, once the issue of causation was
determined adversely to the plaintiff, its entitlement to any
substantial
damages disappeared.
<P>

31   	Waddell J then referred to a number of authorities in
England and in the High Court, which dealt with the question of patent
infringement with which <b>Windsurfing</b> was concerned.  After doing so he
said:-
<P>

<b>"In my opinion this approach is the one which is likely to be appropriate in
perhaps the majority of cases.  But clearly there must
be limits to the extent
to which it can be regarded as just to require a party who has succeeded on an
issue to pay the costs of
the generally successful party in respect of that
issue on the ground that he acted reasonably in raising or opposing it.  For
instance,
an issue may have been sufficiently distinct from other issues and
have involved sufficient time and expense to justify ordering
a party who has
been generally successful to pay the costs of the party who succeeded on that
issue even if the generally successful
party acted reasonably in raising or
opposing it".</b>
<P>

Thereafter his Honour turned to consider the particular facts of that case.
<P>

32   	As I have suggested, when one stands back from this case
the generally successful party, on the issue of damages, was the
defendant.  It
is, in my respectful opinion, impossible to contend to the contrary.  This
success was not limited to quantum, but
to the entitlement to recover
notwithstanding the admitted negligence. All but a short part of the hearing
was taken up in determining
the issues on which the defendant succeeded.
<P>

33   	The plaintiff's submissions then turned to the wasted
costs of the Class IV proceedings always having been issue. I think
I have
dealt with this matter sufficiently, save that it will be necessary for me to
give consideration to whether I should allow
some costs to the plaintiff in
relation to it.  
<P>

34   	Nextly, the plaintiff's submissions returned to the
abandonment of the defences of failure to mitigate, and the submission
was made
that the "ultimate defence to the claim for damages was not clearly
foreshadowed in the pleadings".  It was submitted that
a fair reading of
paragraphs 30 to 34 indicated that the principal issues to be raised by the
defendant were mitigation and contributory
negligence.  It was added that "the
causation defence arises (if at all) in paragraphs 30(b) and 31(b) of the
Defence merely as a
denial".  I have already referred to the way in which the
absence of causation was pleaded and expressed my view about this
submission.
<P>

35   	The case was fought as one based on lack of causation and,
if that was decided adversely to the defendant, the amount of damages,
although
there is no doubt that the failure to mitigate was pleaded and not pursued.
However, before one ever reached that issue,
it was clear from the pleadings
that the plaintiff had to establish a causative link between the admitted
negligence and the damage
it was claiming.
<P>

36   	Nextly the submissions dealt with the costs of re-opening.
The plaintiff applied for leave to re-open by a Notice of Motion
filed on 7
April 1999, if agreement could not be reached between the experts, as to the
amount of its damages.  This was not concerned
with the wasted costs' issue.
The defendant opposed the application on the basis that the experts had agreed
on figures, it had accepted
that agreement and there should be finality in
litigation.  It did not contend that it was prejudiced in the sense of not
being able
to respond, but rather that it was too late for the plaintiff to be
seeking to recast its case on damages.  On the basis that the
Court's primary
duty is to determine all matters in issue, I decided, in the exercise of my
discretion, to grant leave to re-open.
 This, of course, was a concession to
the plaintiff and was necessitated because the plaintiff wished to bring
forward further evidence
as to the damages it had suffered. Thus it had failed
to prove at the appropriate time the amount it claimed. I reserved the question
of costs and, in the event, the re-opening did not assist the plaintiff,
although the final figures, if others think the plaintiff
is entitled to
succeed further, reflect the fact that the plaintiff had such leave.  I do not
see any basis on which the plaintiff
is entitled to the costs of the
re-opening, in which observations I include the written submissions in support
of and opposition
to that course.  In my opinion those costs should be treated
as general costs in the proceedings.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

37   	In my opinion this is an appropriate case in which the
plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs of the inquiry into damages.
 There
can be no doubt that the defendant was the generally successful party. The only
question which remains is whether I should
reduce the amount to which the
defendant is entitled by some percentage to recognise the conceded success the
plaintiff achieved.
 I have come to the view I should not.  Traditionally that
exercise is performed, and I do not see any reason why one would depart
from
that approach in this case, by awarding a percentage of the costs.  However,
the costs in this case are so influenced by the
costs of the issues on which
the plaintiff failed, that to award a percentage of the costs for the small
amount of time taken in
resolving the issues on which it succeeded would be to
penalise the defendant, in the sense that the amount to which a percentage
figure would be applied is inflated by the areas in which the plaintiff failed.
In any event I would not adopt this approach because
it seems to me that such
success as the plaintiff enjoyed, in the context of this litigation and in the
circumstances in which it
occurred, were those minimal successes that the
generally unsuccessful party usually achieves in all litigation and which, in
most
cases, is never raised as justifying some special order as to costs.
<P>

38   	The apportionment of costs requires distinct issues, which
have been litigated, giving rise to some reasonably substantial
success to the
"generally unsuccessful party".  In this case if the issues of liability and
damages had not been separated, and the
same results had followed, an
apportionment of costs based on the plaintiff's success on liability and the
defendant's on damages
would have been justified.  To some extent the
separating of the issues may have caused the costs' questions to be viewed in a
somewhat
different light.  However, in substance it should not change the
result.  The plaintiff succeeded on liability and received the costs
of that
issue.  The defendant succeeded, for all materially relevant purposes, on the
issue of damages and it should receive its
costs to mark that general
success.
<P>

39   	In my opinion there is no basis upon which it would be a
proper exercise of discretion to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's
costs.  Further, in my opinion, there is no basis for denying the defendant its
costs or for making any apportionment of costs. 
Consistently with what I wrote
earlier, the costs should include the costs of re-opening.
<P>

40   	I have now been advised that the agreed amount for the
wasted costs, inclusive of interest, is $227,025.66.
<P>

<b>One Other Matter</b>
<P>

41   	The parties agreed that paragraph 5 of my reasons could
give rise to some difficult in that the necessity for the application
to modify
DA1 was a requirement of BA1, and, accordingly, they agreed that the following
words should be deleted from paragraph 5:-
<P>

<b>"... and that an application be made to modify DA1 pursuant to s.102 of the
Act."</b>
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

42   	I order:-
<P>

(a)	Judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of
$227,025.66.
<P>

(b)	The plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings, including
reserved costs, save in so far as no other orders for
costs have been made.
<P>

(c)	Exhibits be returned.
<P>

(d)	By consent there be deleted from the third sentence of paragraph 5 the
words:-
<P>

<b>"... and that an application be made to modify DA1 pursuant to s.102 of the
Act."</b>
