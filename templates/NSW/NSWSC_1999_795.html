<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff was seriously and tragically
injured whilst at work on 6 December 1996.  His services were obtained
by the
first defendant for the purpose of painting work on a building site.  The
second defendant was generally in charge of the
building site.  Whether the
plaintiff was employed or he was a subcontractor of the first defendant is a
matter which, in the circumstances,
is not a relevant issue.
<P>

2   	An elevating work platform was provided to the plaintiff
for the purpose of undertaking the painting.  It was fully extended
when it
fell taking the plaintiff with it. It seems virtually certain that the platform
collapsed because it was placed on sloping
ground with timber used as chocks or
supports.  There is expert evidence on the point but to the lay mind this is
self-evidently
unsafe.  Indeed, it was not seriously submitted in this Court on
behalf of the first defendant that, assuming the first defendant
to be
otherwise responsible, it was not negligent in this respect.
<P>

3   	I have no doubt that if the action brought by the plaintiff
against the first defendant proceeded to trial he would obtain
judgment for
substantial damages against it.
<P>

4   	The evidence linking any employee of the second defendant
with the circumstances of the use of the platform is exiguous in
the extreme.
I do not go so far as to say that the second defendant would escape liability
were the matter to proceed to trial but
I am not satisfied that the plaintiff
would obtain judgment against that defendant.
<P>

5   	This is an application under sections 76E, 76F, and 76G of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a> for interim damages.  It is evident from the
conclusions which I have set out above that I consider that the Court can make
an order
for interim damages against the first but not against the second
defendant.
<P>

6   	Dr Yeo, whose report has been tendered on the plaintiff's
behalf, describes his position succinctly but sufficiently as follows
-
<P>

"Mr Dimkovski has suffered serious head and trunk injuries with evidence of
permanent brain damage.  He has permanent disturbance
of cognitive function and
a severe loss of memory.  He requires assistance for all activities of daily
living.  I would not expect
any further significant improvement to occur.
Since his discharge from hospital Mr Dimkovski has been cared for in large
measure
by his wife and children and wider family.  They have been assisted by
care paid for by  the first defendant under its worker's compensation
obligations presently amounting to assistance for 32 hours a week."
<P>

7   	At present it is expected that, unless expedited, the
plaintiff's trial will take place some time towards the end of the year
2000.
It may be that some further delay might be occasioned by virtue of problems
with the Court's list in the latter half of next
year.  Were it not that the
Court has jurisdiction to make orders of the kind which I propose in this case
expedition of this case
would and could be achieved.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff claims the cost of further nursing and
attendant care to the expected date of trial and loss of earnings for
this
period.  I consider that he should have both (which is not contested by the
first defendant) upon the assumption that the trial
will occur in about 18
months or so. The defendant disputes the extent of the claim under both these
heads.
<P>

9   	For present purposes I do not think it is necessary to
analyse the evidence in detail.  There is no evidence that substantially
controverts the assessment by Dr Middleton, whose specialty is rehabilitative
medicine, and Miss Anna Castle-Burton, an occupational
therapist, both of whom
have provided extensive and convincing reports, the substantial conclusion of
which is that having regard
to the plaintiff's ongoing extensive care needs he
requires care for 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
<P>

10   	I have mentioned that Mrs Dimkovska and the plaintiff's
family are presently providing a significant portion of the plaintiff's
care
needs.  The stresses of this are obvious to commonsense but are succinctly set
out in Miss Castle-Burton's report.  I do not
propose to set out those passages
in this judgment.  They cannot continue care for him at the same level in the
medium to long-term
as they are presently doing, though perforce they must
continue for the short term.
<P>

11   	Mrs Dimkovska undertakes some aspects of her husband's
care but cannot manage anything requiring significant physical strength.
Whilst Miss Castle-Burton says she is "unable to manage any of Mr Dimkovski's
physical care" this I think is somewhat of an overstatement.
 Even so, her
continuing assistance for the plaintiff does not diminish the need in my view
for the two carers which Miss Castle-Burton
says are necessary, one required 24
hours a day with a second needing to be available to provide additional
assistance during key
times during the day such as during the morning, lunch
time, afternoon rest routine and in the evening for two or so hours.
Objectively,
a live-in house couple is needed and this is Miss Castle-Burton's
recommendation.  It is not sought to be substantially controverted
by the
defendant.  At present, however, there is no accommodation for such a couple
since the premises presently occupied by Mr Dimkovski
and his family are too
small.
<P>

12   	Before making an assessment of the appropriate sum to be
allowed under this head I need to deal with the other claim for the
cost of
acquisition of land for the construction of a home and the cost of construction
of that home which will be suitable for occupation
by the plaintiff having
regard to his  disabilities.  It is not submitted by the defendant that
ultimately ordinary accommodation
will be adequate for the plaintiff's
purposes.  Some appropriately adjusted premises will need to be provided.
There may be a debate
about the extent of the adjustment.
<P>

13   	The home proposed on the plaintiff's behalf and designed
by Mr John Watts is in accordance with what might reasonably be required
in
cases of this kind except that a third bedroom is specified for Mr Dimkovski's
daughter and a fourth and fifth for another daughter,
son-in-law and grandson.
The basis for the provision of these bedrooms is that these members of the
family provide a significant
level of assistance to the plaintiff and his wife.
The design, however, also provides for a two bedroom flat for live-in carers.
Having regard to the medical and other evidence it is clear that both are
unnecessary although one can easily appreciate the ties
of affection, sympathy
and family feeling which animate the desire of the plaintiff and his wife on
the one hand to have their children
with them in this time of calamity and on
the other the desire of those members of the family to help as much as they
can.  Even
so, the expense of that undertaking cannot, as the law presently
stands, be placed at the first defendant's door.
<P>

14   	It is clear, as I have said, that eventually the plaintiff
must have appropriate accommodation.  It is unlikely that this
could be
provided much before the expiration of 12 months.  For that period therefore
live-in care is not a reasonable option.  After
that period such care obviously
would be available.
<P>

15   	The cost of live-out attendant care does not vary
significantly from live-in care when the additional assistance required
during
weekends and the like is borne in mind, although the two sums do not exactly
coincide. However, giving the plaintiff compensation
for that level of care
upon the assumption that it will suffice and hence that the care of the family
with the exception of Mrs Dimkovska
is not strictly necessary however much the
family may wish to help, means that the provision of a home at the level
specified by
the architect would result in a degree of double dipping.
<P>

16   	Having regard to the purposes of the present application,
it is inappropriate for me to attempt to deal, as entirely independent
heads of
compensation, with the cost of further nursing and attendant care and the cost
of acquisition of land and the construction
of an appropriate house.  The
latter aspect is complicated by the fact that the first defendant would be
entitled to have a credit
for the cost of accommodation for the plaintiff which
he would have at all events expended had he not been injured.  There is no
material before me that enables me to do any more than make a somewhat
speculative estimate of what this credit might be but it is
not an
insubstantial sum.  Doing the best I can, it would be, I think, in the order of
about $150,000.
<P>

17   	I am of the view that the appropriate sum to allow as
interim damages for further nursing and attendant care is $375,000.
<P>

18   	In respect of the acquisition of land and the
construction of a home I do not accept that the defendant should pay for a five
bedroom house together with an independent flat which is the building requiring
what amounts to a double block of land.  Under this
head I allow for land
$290,000 and, making the best adjustment that I can, (which is a difficult one
because no alternative expert
evidence is available) I allow $400,000 for the
cost of construction of a home.
<P>

19   	I referred to the credit to which the defendant would be
entitled to reflect the plaintiff's probable expenditure on housing
and
accommodation if he were not injured.  That is a sum which would be calculated
by reference to his lifetime.  I am presently
dealing only with the period
between now and the trial and it is accordingly inappropriate to allow the
whole of that sum.  That
being the principle, however, one must accept that
there might be in respect of this head of damage a significant overpayment.
Bearing
in mind that judgment will be for a global sum and that past and future
economic loss, together with general damages and future care,
will need to be
reflected in it I consider that even so I should not make more than a
relatively slight allowance in the defendant's
favour.  Doing the best I can I
deduct the sum of $30,000.  To do otherwise may have the ironic effect of
providing a sum designed
to permit appropriate accommodation for the plaintiff
and yet insufficient having regard to his apparent means to permit this to
be
done.  I consider that the interim character of the present proceedings
justifies a somewhat rough and ready approach to the calculation
of an
appropriate sum under section 76E.
<P>

20   	It is not controversial that the plaintiff's loss of
earnings from 13 August 1999 to 12 February 2001 is $43,680.  The defendant
submits that a net sum representing this amount, less the workers' compensation
presently being paid, is the material amount.  However,
I am persuaded by Mr
Neil SC, for the plaintiff, that the appropriate calculation is to give the
full amount and specify the dates
to enable appropriate abatement to be made of
the workers' compensation sums paid for loss of income.  The basis for this is
clear.
 Even if this be a mistaken view appropriate adjustment can be made at
the hearing.  Accordingly, I order the first defendant to
pay to the plaintiff
part of the damages sought to be recovered in the proceedings, the sum of
$1,078,680.  I regard this sum as
being a reasonable proportion of the damages
which are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff in the action.
<P>

21   	The extent of any contributory negligence or cognate
allowance is uncertain at this stage.  I am of the view, however, that
it would
not be of such an extent as should affect the amount which I order to be paid
at this time.
<P>

22   	I will reserve the question of costs in relation to both
defendants.
<P>

23   	I make clear that the present orders ought not to preclude
the first defendant taking such action as it may be advised in
respect of any
contribution from the second defendant.
<P>

24   	I grant a stay to the first defendant of 28 days subject
to the payment within 14 days to the Protective Commissioner of $350,000
on the
plaintiff's behalf.
<P>
