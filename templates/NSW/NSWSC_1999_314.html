<b><u>NR 600066/94  -  ROUELLA ARGENTIN EAST  v   HUBERT EARL KING</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: In this action the plaintiff seeks damages in respect of injuries
which she sustained in an accident on 4 September
1993.  She had been born on
30 June 1956 and was therefore 37 years of age when injured and is now nearly
43. She was born in Cairo,
I gather of Greek parentage.  She was educated
variously in Cyprus, Kuwait and ultimately at the West Ryde High School.  It is
not
necessary for me to recount these matters in detail. She was injured when
riding a motorcycle and it appears that an oncoming vehicle
made a right hand
turn across her path.  Liability is conceded and the case is before the Court
solely for the assessment of damages.
<P>

2	She was admitted first to Lismore Base Hospital; later transferred to
Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane; later transferred
to the Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital in Sydney, returned to Lismore Base Hospital, then to St
Vincent's Hospital in Lismore for rehabilitation.
 In all she was hospitalised
for something in the order of six months.
<P>

3	Particularly during her stay at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital she
underwent multiple major surgical and neurological procedures.
 It was
mentioned in the course of evidence that the reason for transfer from Brisbane
to Sydney was that the surgeon in Sydney was
the only person in Australia
qualified to perform the highly delicate and major surgery which the plaintiff
needed.
<P>

4	There is a summary of the plaintiff's injuries in a transfer letter which was
received by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  That
lists the following
injuries:
<P>

	1.  	Pulmonary contusion with fractured ribs on the right and haemothorax.
<P>

	2.  	Fracture of the base of the skull with intracranial air and subarachnoid
haemorrhage.
<P>

	3.   Fractured displaced right patella.
<P>

	4.  	Fracture of left distal humeral shaft which was compound.
<P>

	5.  	A compound comminuted fracture of the proximal ulna with dislocation of
the radial humeral joint on the left.
<P>

	6.  Fractured right clavicle.
<P>

5	The summary thus scheduled scarcely tells the story of the multiple injuries
to the plaintiff.  Her head injuries have had catastrophic
effect upon her
eyes.  I observe that although the plaintiff attended for multiple medical
examinations arranged on behalf of the
defendant, it has been chosen to tender
only three reports, respectively from an ear  nose and throat specialist, an
oral surgeon
and a physician. The inference I draw in this case is that the
evidence contained in the plaintiff's medicals can be readily accepted
in the
light of that withholding of medical reports by the defendant.
<P>

6	It is perhaps worth noting in passing that the physician's report which the
defendant did tender, that is to say the report of
Dr Allsop, dated 12 March
1998 contains this opinion:
<P>

	"She has been left with certain residua which should probably now be
considered as permanent.  There could be some cognitive impairment
though in my
opinion this is not of major proportions.  There is an organic impairment of
balance.  Whether this is at the brain
stem level or peripherally in the
labyrinth is difficult to say.  The speech difficulty suggests that it might be
central.  She has
residual ocular palsies namely of 6th nerve function on
either side and of up gaze which are the residua of carotico-cavernous
fistulas.
 She requires the presence of a ventriculoperitonial shunt to stop
the recurrence of hydrocephalus which developed as a result of
subarachnoid
haemorrhage resulting from the accident. She has mild bilateral facial
palsy".
<P>

7	The doctor went on to say that he would not comment with any further detail
on her orthopaedic injuries or her soft tissue injuries.
<P>

8	As I have said, I accept the medical opinion tendered on behalf of the
plaintiff. It is unnecessary in my view to take up time
reciting what can be
read there. It is very substantial in volume. I would say, however, in passing
that although I do not doubt
the right of the medical attendants to the
plaintiff to be proud of their heroic efforts, when one reads observations such
as that
of Dr McGee-Collett prognosticating that the plaintiff's future is
"rather favourable", that observation has to be read in the context
of the
plaintiff being (as I find her to have been) uninjured prior to the accident.
Indeed when I read that the doctor wrote "rather
favourable", I was impelled to
ask myself, compared to what?
<P>

9	It is important in this case to record that the plaintiff needs to be seen in
presentation, and to watch her struggle with ordinary
activities like moving
from the Court floor into the witness box and trying to speak. Her speech and
her mobility are both impaired,
and I observed many times that she moved her
hands with a type of spastic waving.
<P>

10	There are other matters which affect her. Her eyes as a result of these
critical injuries have lost their tear duct capacity.
That means that the eyes
do not lubricate themselves. She has to insert artificial tears.  At night she
has to place a substance
upon her eyes to get through the sleeping hours during
which, unlike those without such damage, eyes are constantly lubricated through
the tear ducts.
<P>

11	A further complication is that the damage to her ducts seems to have sent
material to join it to her saliva, and she dribbles.
<P>

12	Despite all of this the plaintiff presents with a  cheerful demeanour. Dr
Thompson, an orthopaedic surgeon, who gave some  oral
evidence commented that
he thought that she perhaps lacked real insight into the extent of her
disabilities. I agree entirely, and
would make that finding for myself.
<P>

13	I should record that I do not believe the defendant can take any comfort
from the enthusiastic answers in cross-examination given
by the plaintiff when
she smiled and observed that she thought she could engage in various
activities. Indeed, the impression I formed
was that if she had been asked
whether she thought she could succeed in astronaut training she would have
smiled and said she would
give it a try.
<P>

14	On the question of non-economic loss, it is agreed that the specified figure
in the statute is $259,000. Senior counsel for the
plaintiff submitted that
this case viewed in entirety should be assessed as a most extreme case
therefore, requiring a proportion
of 100 percent. Counsel for the defendant
said that he declined to put a figure upon it but somewhat shyly mentioned that
he thought
it would be difficult to reach 75 percent.
<P>

15	I have yet not in these observations referred to personal matters of a
non-economic kind which have also affected the plaintiff.
She gave evidence,
which I accept, that when she returned from hospital her own children were
frightened of her, so changed and repulsive
to them was her appearance. With
time that has changed. I have not mentioned matters such as the strabismus
which affects the eye
as well as the diplopia. This makes it necessary for her
to wear spectacles with one eye covered.
<P>

16	There has been some evidence in relation to the breakup of her marriage, and
suffice it to say that I am satisfied on the probabilities
that there is a
causative connection between that breakup and the aftermath of this
accident.
<P>

17	I am conscious that my task is to look at categories, and that "a most
extreme case" is not a description of "the" most extreme
case. Non economic
losses are always matters of impression. I believe that the plaintiff does
approach a most extreme case, but balancing
the justice between the parties I
have come to the conclusion that for the purposes of the Act the totality of
her disability should
be proportioned at 90 percent of a most extreme case.
Accordingly there will be included an item for non-economic loss of
$233,100.
<P>

18	I should move to record some details of the plaintiff's history. I mentioned
that she completed her education after coming to
Australia and attending a high
school at Ryde. She then went to a receptionist training centre and, thereafter
seems to have been
consistently employed in jobs such as being a telex clerk
with companies in transport or like business.
<P>

19	She was obviously an energetic young woman, and she frequently engaged in
second jobs, working at the Paddington Tavern and the
Royal Randwick Hotel from
time to time.
<P>

20	She moved to Lismore in 1983. It was said that she wished to avoid the
stresses of city life. She here met Mr Michael East who
became her husband.
<P>

21	After moving to this area her work was somewhat spasmodic. She had worked
for a time (during season I gather) in a macadamia
factory, and she did some
librarianship training at the local TAFE.
<P>

22	She had two children born respectively in October 1985  and April 1988.
Accordingly during a span of time from her arrival in
Lismore until 1991 she
worked comparatively briefly. However, once the two children had been born, and
the younger was in his fourth
year, she and her husband bought a small business
called The Games Room. Much of the debate in this litigation has centred around
this business.
<P>

23	It appears to have been a shop which had some computer games and sold other
games, board games and the like; and as well the
plaintiff herself made and
hired children's party costumes.
<P>

24	The plaintiff's husband had been an employee of Telstra and had been made
redundant. The business was purchased for about $44,000;
the source of that
money being primarily, as I understand it, the redundancy payment which Mr East
had received. The price paid,
however, represented really the stock and
fittings at the shop. The goodwill was a nominal $3. The shop apparently was
the subject
of only a monthly tenancy and to that extent the business was
always vulnerable to a notice to quit from the landlord.
<P>

25	I am satisfied that it was the plaintiff's intention to continue to conduct
this shop. I do not believe that it was altogether
intended as a major
entrepreneurial effort and the goals were modest. To an extent the plaintiff
and her husband had adopted what
is generally referred to as an alternative
lifestyle. This is not a matter of criticism, it is a matter of their choice,
but it is
necessary to look at it when damages are sought which can only be
returned and reflected in economic terms.
<P>

26	They had bought some acreage about twenty minutes drive from Lismore. The
plaintiff's husband became an owner builder. He was
unemployed after
retrenchment from Telstra and up to the time of the accident had spent about
five years building their home. Some
evidence suggests that it is still not
complete.
<P>

27	The plaintiff's husband, so far as the evidence demonstrates, does not seem
to have worked since leaving Telstra with the exception
of the contribution
that he made towards the operation of The Games Room.
<P>

28	The plaintiff was cross-examined as I have earlier mentioned, and she
indicated in response that she thought she could do many
things. I accept her
evidence as honest but I think she lacks the insight as to what are the real
restrictions upon her abilities.
From a personal point of view that lack is
probably benevolent, but in a real and practical sense I am satisfied that she
is totally
at the present and will remain in the future unemployable in any
commercial sense.
<P>

29	I made earlier reference also to the breakdown of marriage. The history is
that the plaintiff's husband left for about four months
in August 1997 but
returned about four months later.  The plaintiff said he was missing the
children. He remained then until early
this year.
<P>

30	It should be observed that both the plaintiff and her husband have been
attending for some counselling with a psychologist. I
observed from her reports
that the plaintiff's husband is trying to be loyal, although somewhat
surprisingly, if I may comment, the
psychologist seems to have embarked upon a
process of suggesting to the parties that they should "realistically", in her
terms, see
the  marriage is ended and get on with their separate lives. It is
not for me to further comment upon that matter, but it is relevant
to observe
that the plaintiff's husband seeks to remain a friend to her; he is presently
residing in Lismore and goes out to the
property from time to time and does odd
jobs. Given the apparent urging of the psychologist, this is unlikely to be
permanent. Those
circumstances will need to be looked at when I come next to
the individual items of damage.
<P>

31	I have commenced with an assessment of non-economic loss. It is agreed that
out of pocket expenses to date are $71,978.
<P>

32	Next it is convenient to deal with an assortment of claims which have been
advanced in submission on behalf of the plaintiff
assisted by documented
calculations for which I express my gratitude. Indeed the careful and
comprehensive preparation of those submissions,
which can remain with the
papers, has made it possible for me to proceed expeditiously to judgment.
<P>

33	I deal with claims for future pharmaceutical expenses. These have been
calculated in accordance with the submission at a weekly
rate upon the
authorised discount multiplier, and a capital sum of $4,309 is sought. No
resistance was indicated by the defendant
and I include that amount in the
damages.
<P>

34	The next submission relates to a schedule of claimed future medical
expenses. The first item is for some future surgery to relieve
the appearance
of the plaintiff's eye squint. The calculated cost is some $2,009. I made
reference to the shunt which is inserted
in the plaintiff's head. It requires
replacement in accordance with the evidence, and that amount as claimed in the
schedule should
be included.
<P>

35	There is a claim for an annual neurological review which I regard as
reasonable and supported by the evidence. There are claims
then, fourthly and
fifthly, for dental treatment and psychological counselling.
<P>

36	The plaintiff was not specifically asked whether she intended to have all of
these treatments. Obviously the shunt replacement
will not really be a matter
of her choice, it is necessary and needs to be done
<P>

37	The total claim for all the psychological counselling, the dental treatment
and the other matters is $21,454. Counsel for the
defendant pointed out that
there was the gap in the evidence as to whether all of this treatment would be
undertaken, or undertaken
to the extent calculated. Taking into account those
matters I have come to the conclusion that using the figures in the submission
as a guide, a fair sum to include in the damages would be $18,000, and I
propose so to do.
<P>

38	The next schedule relates to the expenses of future travelling for medical
treatment. The items include the postulated squint
surgery, the replacement of
the shunt, the neurological review, dental treatment, psychological
counselling, that is to say the five
items in the previous schedule, together
with community reintegration counselling. This is an undertaking which has been
suggested
as being of likely benefit to the plaintiff, but again there was no
evidence from her as to whether she wished or intended to undertake
it.
<P>

39	It has to be observed that some of the items would not require separate
trips and, no doubt, the plaintiff (who gave  evidence
that she comes into shop
in Lismore a couple of times a week) would make her trips on occasions of dual
or treble purpose. It is
always possible by the use of arithmetic to
extrapolate figures, but my task is one of judgment not essentially of
arithmetic.  The
amount claimed as calculated by the schedule is $13,080. A
fair amount of damages for travelling which the plaintiff is likely to
undertake in my view would be $10,000, and I include that round sum.
<P>

40	The next item is the community reintegration counselling which I mentioned a
few moments ago. This is estimated to cost $4,360.
 As I have said, there is no
evidence from the plaintiff about her wish or intentions in connection with
this. In order to allow
for the possibility that she may wish to undergo it,
however, I would include $3,000 in the damages.
<P>

41	The next items to which I intend to make reference are the various claims
for domestic assistance and provision of handymen for
the plaintiff and the
like.
<P>

42	I am satisfied that there are tort induced needs which sound in damages to
which the plaintiff is entitled. This is a topic which
has been the subject of
much debate between the parties. I should observe that in my finding the
plaintiff herself would be the worst
judge of exactly what she needs. Her
cheerful demeanour is such that she seems willing to agree to propositions that
are put to her
as to what she can do which in my view are far beyond her
realistic capacities.  That represents one extreme.
<P>

43	There is a long report of an occupational therapist, Miss Julie Wilson.
Again, on the other extreme, that report seems to contain
most of the things
that Miss Wilson can think of that might be done for the plaintiff. The tort
induced needs I think lie somewhere
in between the extremes.
<P>

44	In the course of cross-examination of the plaintiff's husband, counsel for
the defendant extracted estimates from him as to the
hours that he devoted to
attending to the plaintiff's needs when he was there. A submission was
summarised by saying that he does
hardly anything beyond what he had done
before the accident. The test is of course whether or not there are tort
induced needs which
sound in damages.  I have observed that the plaintiff's
husband is unlikely to be about in the future.
<P>

45	The plaintiff is to a large extent independent in her personal needs, but
she has considerable restrictions as to what she can
do. In taking into account
the material emanating from both herself, her husband and Miss Wilson, and the
observations of her friends,
I have come to the conclusion that for the purpose
of calculating damages for the period between her discharge from hospital and
the present, an estimate of three hours per day is appropriate.
<P>

46	I am conscious that by permutations and combinations of the evidence, one
can find the plaintiff's needs as ranging anywhere
between about nearly forty
hours a week down to about half an hour a week. As I have indicated, I have
reached the judgment that
I have indicated as a result of trying to balance my
findings as to what the plaintiff's real needs are from all the sources. I
think
that the plaintiff's needs have been larger during the earlier period
post-accident, and as she has gained some independence, that
has decreased.
<P>

47	I have chosen the specified rate as something which would represent a
reasonable guide for the purpose of assessing damages during
the whole
period.
<P>

48	Three hours per day would mean the provision of services for twenty-one
hours per week, but pursuant to the Motor Accidents Act
I am obliged to deduct
six hours from that when I come to the question of calculation.  Therefore, the
amount for calculation for
the past will refer to fifteen hours per week.
<P>

49	The plaintiff has advanced a claim for the past in two stages as it were.
The first stage results in a computed claim for $63,118,
and the methodology
whereby this figure has been reached can be seen in a schedule to Exhibit D, a
report from the accountant Mr
Keep. I do not need to recite the rates of pay
per week and per hour that are there set out. I can, however, use the rates
therein
to reduce the twenty-four hours per week which he hypothesized to
fifteen hours per week in order to reach a figure of $39,448 which
I propose to
include in the damages.
<P>

50	The second stage of the plaintiff's claim is based upon the services
provided by the plaintiff's husband. At one stage of the
evidence he estimated
that he spent five hours a day looking after his wife.  And I have already made
mention of the concession to
the defendant's counsel which led to the
submission that he made. Applying the fifteen hour rate, which I repeat, allows
the six
hour deduction required by the statute, I would include in the damages
for the period during which the husband was providing the
services, $13,903.
That figure is calculated by using the same methodology as the schedule
advanced by the plaintiff which lead to
a claim for $22,245. I do not need to
set out the method of calculation.
<P>

51	So far as the future is concerned, the claim is made for an actual
expenditure of three hours per week which capitalizes in accordance
with the
authorised rate at $56,100. I regard that claim as reasonable to the point of
being extremely modest, and I propose to include
the entirety of that sum in
the damages.
<P>

52	I can observe that the calculations which I have done would mean that there
is an arbitrary cutoff point between present and
future when the services
postulated move from fifteen hours per week to the three hours. The change of
course will not in reality
be as stark as that, but as I have indicated I
selected the fifteen hours per week to represent the entirety of the past
period.
 The plaintiff's early needs after discharge from hospital I find were
probably much greater than that but they have tailed off,
as it were, over the
ensuing period.
<P>

53	I am conscious that there is a six month period at the beginning of the
plaintiff's claim which the statute requires me to ignore.
It so happens that
the plaintiff was in hospital for approximately that period, but that does not
prevent time from running.  Therefore,
the period required by the statute has
been appropriately taken into account.
<P>

54	Moving on, the plaintiff makes a claim under a schedule entitled Future
Holiday Expenses. What the plaintiff would be entitled
to as a result of tort
would be any additional cost  referable to the consequences of tort which she
needed to meet on occasion when
she went on holidays. The method adopted by the
plaintiff is one that I would not myself adopt. The claim, however, capitalizes
at
$11,826. I am abundantly satisfied that from time to time during her life if
uninjured the plaintiff would have had holidays, and
I am similarly satisfied
that there will be in the future additional cost for her.
<P>

55	She has, surprisingly if I may comment, been assessed as permitted to drive
a motor car, but with restrictions. One of those
restrictions is that she may
not motor more than fifty kilometres from her home. In the circumstances I have
come to the conclusion
that a lump sum of $10,000 should appropriately be
included in the damages to compensate the plaintiff for the additional cost
that
I have indicated.
<P>

56	The next item of damages is related to the cost of future gardening and
handyman about the house. I do not have any detail in
the evidence as to the
property arrangements between the plaintiff and her husband.  As I have
mentioned, he has moved into Lismore
to live and the plaintiff remains on the
property and there is no evidence before me other than that she will continue
to remain
there.
<P>

57	She will be on her own.  It was not suggested that I should consider
hypothetical contribution by the children as they grow.
 It is obvious that she
does not have the capacity to mow the grass or do any repairs or maintenance.
Indeed, her orthopaedic injuries
are such that she cannot really in a practical
fashion work above shoulder level.  To this might be added the imbalance that
she
has and the feelings of syncope which follow her raising her head. This is
apparently a consequence of the shift in equilibrium of
the shunt which is
implanted within her head.
<P>

58	The claim on behalf of the plaintiff is calculated in a fashion set out in
the appropriate schedule and amounts to $34,980. 
There are attached evidential
quotes for the work to be done.  I am satisfied that the claim for that (which
includes specific repair
to the water pump on the property from time to time)
should be allowed, subject to this comment that there is a capital sum of
$4,725
for clearing and hiring equipment to do it.  The plaintiff's husband has
in fact been on the property himself until January this
year and I see no
reason why it is the tortfeasor's responsibility to do initial clearing now of
this property in which the plaintiff's
husband has some interest.  He was the
builder of the house and she presumably has an interest in the property.  The
plaintiff, however,
in the future will be without him and she needs somebody to
do the sorts of tasks that I have indicated wherever she lives.  I therefore
deduct the $4,275 but allow the balance by way of damages and there will be
included $30,705.
<P>

59	As I earlier mentioned there have been major counter-submissions between the
parties on the issue of economic loss.  Before turning
to the ingredients of
these damages that I propose to include I should deal with two discrete
matters. 
<P>

60	The first matter was a reference by senior counsel for the plaintiff to the
loss of the financial support of the husband.  I
was referred to no authority
which suggested that a tort induced loss of the benefits of marriage apart from
financial support could
be categorised under the Motor Accident Act other than
as non economic loss.  In this  particular case I find that the failure of
the
marriage although tort introduced was not of economic consequence.  There was
no evidence that the plaintiff's husband was likely
to be a significant source
of financial support in the future.  He has spent some years unemployed and
working as an owner/builder.
<P>

61	The plaintiff's submission has been that I should read the Games Room
business as a loss by the plaintiff as to 80 percent even
though on paper the
parties were equal partners. I mention at the outset that I regard that as a
very reasonable way of approaching
the matter and entirely justified by the
evidence of their respective contributions to its operation.
<P>

62	I should, however, return to this claim for asserted loss of economic
support derived from marriage.  I was referred to a judgment
of Barr AJ (as he
then was) in a case of<b> Pelosi  v  Commercial Union Assurance</b> 28 February
1995.  In that case, without a great deal of elaboration, his Honour included
in the damages awarded to the plaintiff
in that case $100,000 for "the loss of
financial benefit and support of a husband". Counsel then observed that that
award had been
sustained in the Court of Appeal which delivered the judgment in
an appeal in that case on 2 February 1996.
<P>

63	Analysis of the leading judgment of Sheller JA, however, shows that the
figure was sustained principally because when Barr J
dealt with the ingredients
of his award he had deducted, as it were, from the plaintiff's economic losses,
a period of five years
for what might be described as 'childbirth and infant
raising' and then reduced her rate for a further two years and eight months.
The law has grappled with the problems of justice to women in particular who
leave the work force for the purpose of raising children
and the High Court
in<b> Sharman v Evans</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1977%20138%20CLR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1977 138 CLR 563</a> had said that as a practical matter
justice could be done by simply ignoring the period during which a female
plaintiff was absent
from the work force.
<P>

64	Thus, although the High Court had not said that this must be done, in the
approach taken by Barr AJ he had departed from the
expedient route that the
High Court had indicated could be adopted in the usual case.  Sheller JA
observed that the course of disregarding
the prospect of the marriage as a
relevant factor in the assessment of future economic loss had not been adopted
and he then demonstrated
that if the conventional approach had been taken then
the plaintiff would have had, on the figures in that case before him, almost
the same result.  The critical passage in the judgment on appeal reads:
<P>

	"Using the figures his Honour did to assess the probable earnings but for her
injuries, the respondent would have earned something
in the order of $100,000
after tax during the five years he treated her as not working and the two years
and eight months he treated
her as working part time. Had the expedient course
of disregarding the prospect of marriage as a relevant factor in the assessment
of the respondent's future economic loss been adopted the present value of the
net weekly income earned during this period would
have been in the order of
$100,000 but subject to a 15 percent discount for vicissitudes.  This can be
demonstrated by using a net
weekly salary of $389.89 (see the table his Honour
used) and the actuarial factor (203) Mr McRae provided for the five year period
from 4 May 1997 to 3 May 2002.  The calculation produces a capital sum of
$79,148.  To this must be added superannuation and the
difference between the
capital value of a full salary and a part time salary for the next two years
and eight months.  Taking account
of these considerations, although not
explained, I think his Honour's assessment of $100,000 under this head can be
justified and
should not be disturbed."
<P>

65	In effect, what his Honour said was that - if one did the necessary balance
to the undercompensation of the plaintiff by taking
out that period of her
potential work history, and put it back in again - a figure of nearly $100,000
would be required.  It was
not accurate, therefore, to propose that in the case
of<b> Pelosi</b> the Court of Appeal had approved an accumulation of economic
loss from employment and a further economic loss deriving from the support
of a
husband. 
<P>

66	I was referred to the passing commentary by Mason P in<b> Rozniak v  GIO
</b>(1997) ATR page 64456 but this does not cause me to alter my analysis of
the relevant aspect of <b>Pelosi</b>.
<P>

67	Finally, I should mention that counsel for the defendant objected to this
claim on the basis that no particulars had ever been
given and indeed the
impression I formed was that it was raised in address almost ad hoc, or, I
might almost say al fresco.
<P>

68	Careful analysis of the authorities to which I have been referred shows that
the claim for these damages as an additional matter,
in this case, where
conventional damages for an uninterrupted financial future will be awarded, is
inappropriate.  I therefore decline
to include any particular ingredient for
such a loss, that is not to say,  that the breakdown of the plaintiff's
marriage was not
a relevant factor in the assessment of non economic loss.
<P>

69	The second matter to which I intend to make some preliminary reference is
the capital loss of the business known as the Games
Room.  Again, no
particulars were given of this.  It was observed that the original purchase did
not involve anything but a nominal
payment for goodwill.  It was said that as a
result of the profit made in the year immediately prior to the accident a
goodwill value
had been created.  This was the subject of much examination and
cross-examination of both Mr Keep and Mr Carter, accountants called
respectively on behalf of the plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

70	Both of those gentlemen I accept as genuinely performing their accountancy
tasks in accordance with the instructions given them.
 The problem about taking
the results of their analysis and simply applying them in judgment is that what
is really needed is a judgment
about the validity of the assumptions that they
were asked to make.
<P>

71	The question of the goodwill of the business having been created was
something which emerged in questions asked of Mr Carter
when giving evidence in
chief.  He was asked about putting a value on it and he said:
<P>

	"Well I haven't performed any formal valuation.  What I noted is in the
purchase documentation it was originally acquired by the
Easts for $3 goodwill,
plus fittings, plus stock.  That would indicate that the expectation to the
vendor at the time, say two years
earlier, was that the business wasn't
profitable.  The second thing I point out is that assuming the profitability
had gone on as
appears from the 1993 business record, if we assume that is
valid as deriving $20,000, then we are still talking about a very small
business which the buyer would see a higher risk generally so it might be
$50,000 as an upper limit, probably even less that amount
by one year's
profit."
<P>

72	This was the subject of the some cross-examination by senior counsel for the
plaintiff.  Amongst other things he asked Mr Carter
this question:
<P>

	"So it's worth nothing when they started, and somewhere between 20 and 50 when
they finish.  That is right is it not?"
<P>

Mr Carter answered:
<P>

	"In terms of those numbers, yes."
<P>

73	The final piece of evidence to which I think reference needs to be made
however is the response in re-examination of Mr Carter
when this matter was
raised.  He was asked:
<P>

	"When asked some questions by Mr Wheelahan about the value of this business
being on one view $20,000, and on another view $50,000.
 You say in terms of
those figures, yes - does that answer indicate that you believe there were
other factors that need to be taken
into account?"
<P>

74	Mr Carter's response was:
<P>

	"I was concerned in the way those numbers were put to me that it was to give
them a greater credibility than they deserved, that
is, this is a business with
a very short history.  It has been acquired for $3.  I have speculated as to
what the upper limit of
its value might be.  I have indicated with the $20,000
number that it was really nothing more than a substitution for the labour.
Therefore my concern would be that the manner in which the question was put to
me overstates the real import of what I was trying
to say, that the business is
of negligible value rather than of considerable value."
<P>

75	 Again this was a topic that was raised on the run, as it were.  I know
nothing about the circumstances of the end of business
other than I was told
that it was simply closed down. There is no evidence of attempts to sell it or
to value it at the time of closing
down.
<P>

76	I do not find a claim in these terms that is, capital loss established.
<P>

77	I turn however, to the plaintiff's personal economic loss.  I am satisfied,
as I earlier mentioned that her economic capacity
has been totally destroyed.
The approach to be taken to her economic incapacity was the subject of counter
submissions by counsel.
 As I have mentioned, the plaintiff advanced the
proposition that there should be an award to her of 80 percent of the
appropriate
figure for income loss based on her operation of the Games Room
business and I have said that I regard that as an appropriate approach.
<P>

78	The first sum claimed on behalf of the plaintiff conventionally referred to
as economic loss to date is $126,951. This is calculated
in accordance with a
schedule that can be found in Ex. D on page 6 of the report by Mr Keep called
"Report number 1 Section 5/1".
 As is apparent from that table and from the
assumptions he has made, he has reached that figure assuming a compounding
increase
in the profitability of the business of five percent each and every
year.  I do not regard that as a reasonable approach.  I indicated
briefly
earlier that I did not think that the plaintiff had gone into this business in
an extravagantly entrepreneurial sense.  I
am sure that she intended to spend
her time there and she enjoyed it and would have continued so to do but I am
also satisfied that
it was as much an outlet for her skills such as in the
making of the costumes for the children as a commercial undertaking.  One
of
the matters which was canvassed was the rather odd circumstance at first glance
that the profit in the year ending 1992 (which
represented only ten months of
operation) was derived from a turnover (essentially, I gather, of cash through
the till) very little
different from the turnover in the following full year
which resulted in a profit of $20,000 to the partners.
<P>

79	As I said during the course of evidence, that seemingly surprising situation
merely emphasises that a business of this nature
would be likely to return
vastly different profits by way of margin depending on which activity is being
productive.
<P>

80	The business bought some stock.  The plaintiff, herself, in effect
manufactured some of the stock and my attention has not been
directed to any
material from which I could make any sensible estimate as to how the
differences could have arisen.
<P>

81	The figure of $400 per week is derived from the full year profit in
operation of $20,000.  That seems to me to be as good a guide
figure as any
with which I might appropriately start.
<P>

82	The defendant's submission, although he did not embrace it, was that at most
I should take that figure of the $400 which is of
course a gross figure and
reduce it to $350 to allow for tax and, again, award the plaintiff 80 percent
of that.
<P>

83	He then invited me to take off a discount for preponderance of adverse
vicissitudes during the past.  This is an unusual and
unconventional
invitation.  There is nothing before me to suggest that the plaintiff should be
treated in that fashion.  I have not
overlooked the circumstance that during a
long period the plaintiff was on Social Security benefits.  But that does not
seem to me
to be a factor I should reflect in all the circumstances.
<P>

84	The methodology advanced by the defendant would produce figures of somewhere
between $50,000 and $65,000 for the past.
<P>

85	I have already mentioned that the claim by the plaintiff is calculated at
$126,951 but the claim is in fact only for 80 percent
of that for the reasons
which I have earlier mentioned.
<P>

86	If you take the 80 percent of the calculation then the plaintiff's claim
reduces to $101,560.
<P>

87	I have looked at the $400 per week gross and reduced that to $350 per week
net and 80 percent of that over the last 290 weeks
and it actually comes to a
figure of $81,200.
<P>

88	All of that produces a range in submissions and counter submission between
the $50,000 to $65,000 now argued by the defendant
and $101,000 odd sought by
the plaintiff.  The calculation that I have done does produce a figure
somewhere in the middle but it
attracts me as a reasonable approach given all
the circumstances of the plaintiff. Accordingly I propose for economic loss to
date
to include in the damages $81,200.
<P>

89	Next I come to the question of future economic loss.  I take a multiplier of
708.5 for the future.  I have derived  that factor
by performing a necessary
division out of the accountancy figures of Mr Keep's which appear at page 7 of
the report in Exhibit D
which I have mentioned.
<P>

90	The plaintiff's claim for the future is scheduled at $321,290 but it is
acknowledged that her claim is primarily for 80 percent
of that sum and I was
invited by senior counsel for the plaintiff to further reduce any resultant
calculation by 15 percent to allow
for adverse vicissitudes in the conventional
fashion.  Performing the necessary arithmetic, the plaintiff's claim then is
represented
by  $218,477.
<P>

91	The defendant's submission requires me to start with a figure of $280 per
week and then it was counsel's submission that I should
reduce for adverse
vicissitudes by 30 percent for reasons which he gave.  I interpolate that I
reject that submission.  The arithmetical
result on the defendant's submission
produces a capital sum of $138,866.
<P>

92	If I approach the matter in the fashion which I did in relation to past
economic loss, the factors that I would use would be
the $280 per week (which
represents taking taxation from $400 per week profit for a full year operation
and awarding the plaintiff
80 percent of the balance), capitalising that on the
authorised rate and deducting 15 percent as invited by the plaintiff's counsel
for vicissitudes. There is left a calculated figure of $168,623.
<P>

93	Again, I have not failed to observe that that results in a very approximate
but lower than mid point between the result of approach
advanced by the
defendant and that advanced by the plaintiff.
<P>

94	I have not, however, selected that figure because of result but rather
because of approach. Accordingly I include in the plaintiff's
damages for
future economic loss $168,623.
<P>

95	I should observe that in the schedules submitted on behalf of the plaintiff
there was an alternative approach advanced referable
to average weekly
earnings. I would make the observation that it is notorious that the average
weekly earnings are derived from figures
which show that in terms of numbers
more people in employment actually earn less than the average figure than earn
more.
<P>

96	I do not regard reference to average weekly earnings as an appropriate
method in this case. I am fortified in that view by the
observations that I
have made of the plaintiff's departure from Sydney to avoid the stresses of
living and her adoption of what I
have called an alternative lifestyle. The
business that she had established was seemingly one of pleasant but
nonpressured activity.
It was conceded that unless the average weekly earnings
approach was taken, it would not be appropriate in this case to consider
loss
of employer contribution to superannuation. 
<P>

97	Accordingly, the ingredients of damage which I have found for the plaintiff
are as follows:
<P>

	Out of pocket expenses, $71,978;
<P>

	Non-economic loss, $233,100,
<P>

	Future pharmacy, $4,309,
<P>

	Future medical, $18,000,
<P>

	Travel to medical, $10,000.
<P>

	Community reintegration counselling, $3,000
<P>

	The two stages of voluntary assistance to the plaintiff already received,
$39,448 and $13,903 respectively.
<P>

	Future assistance, $56,100.
<P>

	Additional cost of holidays, $10,000.
<P>

	Handyman and household help in the future, $30,705.
<P>

	Past economic loss, $81,200,
<P>

	Future economic loss, $168,623.
<P>

	The total of those ingredients is $740,366.
<P>

98	The plaintiff may be entitled to interest on some of those items, and I
reserve liberty to apply in relation to such interest.
Subject to such claim
being made I would direct entry of judgment for the plaintiff for the total
figure that I have mentioned, and
the defendant will be ordered to pay the
plaintiff's costs.
