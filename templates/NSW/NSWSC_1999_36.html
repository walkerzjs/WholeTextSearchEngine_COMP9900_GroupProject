Witness served in Queensland with a subpoena to give evidence fails to attend.
He was paid $140, advised that he could collect his
air ticket at the airport,
and that he had been booked into a particular hotel for which the party issuing
the subpoena would pay.
 Two letters were provided from a doctor to the effect
that he had a medical reason not to attend.  Party issuing the subpoena seeks
a
warrant to have the witness bought to Court.  HELD (1) that Pt.37 r.3(1) of the
Rules and s.32(1) of the Service &amp; Execution

for expenses to be tendered, but that money need not be tendered for expenses
in relation to which appropriate
assurance is given that such expenses will not
be incurred at all; (2) even if a warrant may be issued under Pt.42 r.7(1) of

<b><u>JUDGMENT (On plaintiff's application for warrant)</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: I am dealing with an application for the plaintiff to issue a
warrant under Pt.42 r.7(1)(e) of the Rules and/or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a>, coupled with s.37(1) of the Service &amp; Execution of Process Act, to
bring one Ile Ignajotivski to Court to give evidence in these
proceedings.
<P>

2	On 6th January 1999, at Newmarket in Queensland, Mr. Ignjatovski was served
with a subpoena to attend to give evidence at this
Court at the hearing
commencing on 1st February 1999.  He was given a cheque for $30.00 and also a
letter dated 5th January 1999
from the plaintiff's solicitor which inter alia
said the following:-
<P>

	<b><i>The conduct money we have enclosed is to assist you in complying with
the subpoena.  We would be grateful if you could contact Elizabeth
Jones of
this office on (02) 9234 4445 to discuss your attendance.  We will make
bookings for your travel and accommodation.</i></b>
<P>

3	The subpoena itself contained the following note:-
<P>

	<b><i>You need not comply with this subpoena - unless reasonable expenses have
been paid or tendered to you.</i></b>
<P>

4	There was also served with the subpoena a notice under the Service &amp;
Execution of Process Act which stated the following:-
<P>

	<b><i>You must obey the attached subpoena if -</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	at the time of service or at some reasonable time before 1st
February 1999 you were offered or given either:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(i)	enough money to meet your reasonable expenses in obeying it
including any travel and accommodation costs; or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(ii)	the combination of money, travel tickets and vouchers to meet those
expenses.</i></b>
<P>

5	Mr.. Ignjatovski then wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor a letter dated 15th
January 1999 in the following terms:-
<P>

	<b><i>Please be advised that no other information is available to that already
supplied in the previous Subpoena 4-5 years ago.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	As discussed with you over the telephone my wife and I are concerned
about my personal security therefore you are requested to insure
(sic) that I
am accommodated at a secure location with adequate protection should I attend
and give evidence in Sydney.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The request to attend court as a witness will undoubtedly cause my
business hardship and loss in income, therefore, if possible I
would be pleased
if I could be excused by not attending.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Should you insist and demand my presence in court I refer to the conduct
money provided by your firm as quiet (sic) insufficient,
and request an
appropriate fee to cover expenses, $1200.00 per day.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Personal estimated expenses to cover my departure from Brisbane which
will be incurred up to my arrival time at the hotel in Sydney
will be $150.00.
In addition a cash advance will be required on arrival at the Sydney Hotel to
cover transport, food and communications
and sundries.</i></b>
<P>

6	On 21st January 1999, the plaintiff's solicitor Mr. Werksman spoke by
telephone to Mr. Ignjatovski.  Mr. Ignjatovski claimed that
he should be
compensated for loss of business caused by attendance pursuant to the subpoena.
Mr. Werksman then said, among other
things:
<P>

	<b><i>In any event our client will pay for your hotel accommodation and
airfares to Sydney.  We will also pay for your cab fares.  You can
let us have
the vouchers for cab charges and we will reimburse you.</i></b>
<P>

7	Mr. Ignjatovski responded:  "I don't want to be reimbursed. I need to have
the money."
<P>

8	Mr. Werksman then enquired as to the amount of taxi fares, and was
subsequently put on hold on the telephone by Mr. Ignjatovski.
 He was unable to
resume the conversation and, on further telephoning Mr. Ignjatovski, was unable
to obtain any response.
<P>

9	A letter was then sent to Mr. Ignjatovski by facsimile on 22nd January 1999,
in the following terms: 
<P>

	<b><i>We refer to the writer's telephone conversation with you this morning.
We confirm that you have been served with a subpoena to attend
the trial in the
above matter in Sydney on 1 February 1999.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Whilst you are obliged by law to be at the Court at 10.00am on Monday
morning, 1 February, we confirm that in order to avoid disrupting
your business
as much as possible, our client would be prepared to arrange for you to travel
to Sydney on Tuesday 2 February, to
consult with Counsel at 4.30pm with a view
to your appearance in Court on Wednesday 3 February.  If you are amenable to
this proposal,
please let us know and we will arrange for airline tickets to be
booked for Tuesday afternoon and for accommodation to be made available
on
Tuesday evening.  We will also forward to you a cheque for $120.00 being our
estimate of the costs which will be involved in travelling
to the airport in
Brisbane and to the city in Sydney and the return fares, at the rate of $30.00
per trip.  We would like you to
be at Mr. Alan Sullivan QC's Chambers, Level
11, Wentworth Chambers, 174 Phillip Street, at 4.30pm on Tuesday.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Please let us know by return if the above proposal is acceptable to
you.</i></b>
<P>

A further letter was sent on 27th January 1999, in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>We refer to our letter of 27 January 1999, copy of which is enclosed for
ease of reference.  We enclose a cheque in the sum of $140.00
to cover the
costs of your cab fares to and from the Brisbane airport and cab charges in
Sydney to the Wentworth Hotel, and the return
fare to Sydney
airport.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We confirm that you were also provided with $20.00 when served with the
subpoena.  On our calculations, the sum of $160.00 will be
more than sufficient
to cover the above cab charges.  If you have any other out of pocket expenses
which are necessarily involved
in attendance at the Court, you will be
reimbursed upon presentation of the relevant vouchers.</i></b>
<P>

10	A further letter was sent by the plaintiff's solicitors to Mr. Ignjatovski
on 28th January 1999, again by facsimile, in the following
terms:
<P>

	<b><i>We refer to our letter of 22 January 1999 to which we have had no
response.  We must accordingly assume that the proposal set out
in our letter
is unacceptable to you.  </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	In the circumstances and in order to enable you to comply with your
obligation to comply with the Subpoena which as (sic) been served
on you to
attend at the Supreme Court Sydney at 10.00am on Monday 1 February 1999, we
have made the following arrangements:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	1.	You are booked on Qantas flight QF551 from Brisbane to Sydney on
Sunday 31 January 1999 departing Brisbane at 6.10pm.  The ticket
will be
available for collection at the Qantas counter at the airport.  The return
flight has been provisionally booked for Wednesday
3 February 1999 on Qantas
flight QF544 departing Sydney at 6.05pm.  If your evidence can be heard earlier
then the booking will be
changed to allow you to return earlier.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	We have booked accommodation for you at the Sydney Wentworth Hotel,
61 Phillip Street, Sydney for the nights of Sunday, Monday
and Tuesday (31
January to 2 February inclusive).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	3.	We are forwarding to you by courier, a cheque for the sum of $140.00
to cover the costs of your cab fare to and from Brisbane
airport and for cab
charges to and from Sydney airport.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Please note that you are legally obliged to appear in Court at 10.00am
on 1 February 1999.  If you are not present our instructions
are to apply to
the Court for an order that you be arrested and brought before the
Court.</i></b>
<P>

11	Mr. Ignjatovski then sent by facsimile a letter to Mr. Werksman which merely
asserted:  "Please find attached doctors certificate
issued to Mr. Ile
Ignjatovski."
<P>

12	Attached to that was a document on the letterhead of Walton Bridge Medical
Centre, purportedly signed by Dr Stuart Johnston,
who was listed as a doctor at
that centre.  The document was dated 29th January 1999 and it asserted:   "Ile
Ignjatovski has a medical
condition which at present needs constant
supervision.  He has been advised to remain in Brisbane."
<P>

13	The plaintiff's solicitors then sent on 29th January 1999, by facsimile to
Mr. Ignjatovski, a letter in the following terms:

<P>

	<b><i>We refer to your letter of 29 January 1999 attaching a purported
doctor's certificate.  Please be advised that we do not consider
the purported
medical certificate to be sufficient to excuse you from complying with the
Subpoena which has been served upon you.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We will be calling on the Subpoena at 10.00am on Monday1 February 1999,
or at such other time as may be mutually agreed between us.
 If you claim that
for medical reasons you are unable to attend at Court then appropriate
affidavit medical evidence from a qualified
medical practitioner should be
filed in Court and a copy sent to us.  The Deponent of that affidavit will be
required for cross-examination.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	In the absence of proper medical evidence justifying non-attendance at
Court, we will ask the Court for an order for your arrest
in order to secure
your attendance.  We hope that this will not be necessary.</i></b>
<P>

14	The response to this was a facsimile of 1st February 1999, signed by Mr.
Ignjatovski, which merely asserted the following:  "Please
find attached
additional medical evidence from Dr Stuart Johnston issued to Mr. Ile
Ignjatovski."
<P>

15	It attached a further document on the letterhead of Walton Bridge Medical
Centre, again purportedly signed by Dr. Stuart Johnston.
 This document was in
the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>Mr. Ile Ignjatovski has been sick since about 15th January 1999 with an
undiagnosed illness. He is being investigated by blood testing
and at present
is receiving drug treatment. As his illness is unknown, there is a possibly of
his being infectious and therefore
has been advised on medical grounds to
remain at home.</i></b>
<P>

16	In deciding whether I should issue a warrant to procure the attendance at
Court of this witness, it is necessary for me to consider
four questions.
<P>

17	First, there is the question of whether, as required by Pt.37 r.3 of the
rules and s.32 of the Service and Execution of Process
Act, reasonable expenses
of complying with the subpoena have been paid or tendered to the witness. Pt.37
r.3(1) of the Supreme Court
Rules is in the following terms: 
<P>

	<b><i>37.3(1)	   A subpoena shall not require the person named to attend or
produce any document or thing on any day on which his attendance
or production
by him is required unless a sum sufficient to meet the reasonable expenses of
the person named of complying with the
subpoena in relation to that day is paid
or tendered to him at the time of service of the subpoena or not later than a
reasonable
time before that day.</i></b>
<P>

18	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 32(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/" class="autolink_findacts">Service and Execution of Process Act 1992</a> (Cwlth) is in
the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>32(1)	Service of the subpoena is effective only if, at the time of
service or at some other reasonable time before the person to whom
the subpoena
is addressed is required to comply with it, allowances and travelling expenses
sufficient to meet the person's reasonable
expenses of complying with the
subpoena are paid or tendered to the person.</i></b>
<P>

19	The second question which I must determine is whether it is necessary for
the plaintiff to prove, in terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, that the
non-appearance of the witness is without just cause or reasonable excuse, and
if it is, whether that matter has in fact
been proved.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 194(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> is in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>194(1)	If a witness fails to appear when called in any civil or criminal
proceedings and it is proved that he or she has been duly
bound by recognisance
or serve with a summons or subpoena, the court may:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	order that the witness show cause at those or later proceedings why
execution of the recognisance or an attachment for disobedience
to the summons
or subpoena should not be issued against the witness, or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	if it is proved that the non-appearance is without just cause or
reasonable excuse and that the witness will probably be able
to give relevant
evidence in the proceedings, issue a warrant to bring the witness before the
court to give the evidence.</i></b>
<P>

20	Power to issue a warrant is also given in Pt.42. r7(1) of the Supreme Court
Rules, which is in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>42.7(1)    Where the Court by subpoena or otherwise, makes an order in
any proceedings for the attendance of a person -</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	for the purpose of giving evidence;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	for the production of any document or thing;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(c)	to answer a charge of contempt; or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(d)	for any other purpose,</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	and the person defaults in attendance in accordance with the order, the
Court may on application by a party or of its own motion
-</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(e)	issue, or make an order for the issue of, a warrant to the Sheriff
or such other person as the Court may appoint for the arrest
of the person in
default and for the production of the person in default before the Court or
before an examiner or other person for
the purpose of the proceedings and for
his detention in custody in the meantime; and</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(f)	order the person in default to pay any costs occasioned by the
default.</i></b>
<P>

21	It has been submitted that, in order for the Court to act under that rule,
it is not necessary that the requirement to which
I have referred of s.194 be
satisfied.
<P>

22	The third question is whether, if I am satisfied of the first two matters, I
should exercise my discretion in favour of ordering
the arrest of the witness
in Queensland, and his being forcibly brought to appear before the Court here
in Sydney.
<P>

23	The fourth question, which is really just a procedural one, concerns the
precise form of the order which I make.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 37(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/" class="autolink_findacts">Service and
Execution of Process Act</a> provides:
<P>

	<b><i>37(1)	If a person (other than a person under restraint) served with a
subpoena under this Division fails to comply with the subpoena,
a court or
authority of the place of issue of the subpoena may issue such warrant as it
might have issued had the subpoena been served
in its place of
issue.</i></b>
<P>

24	A question arises as to whom the warrant in question  should be issued, that
is whether to some New South Wales official or to
some Queensland official.
There is also perhaps a question as to the precise form of the warrant.
<P>

25	Turning first to the question of expenses, in my opinion it is clear that
what has to be provided for is the expense of travel
and accommodation
essentially, and not compensation for loss that might be caused to the witness
by reason of absence from his employment
or business.  If loss of that kind is
claimed, in my opinion that is a matter to be dealt with under Pt.37 r.9 of the
Rules, which
empowers the court to require payment in respect of loss caused to
a witness attending Court.
<P>

26	It seems clear that what is required to be tendered, under Pt.37 r.3 and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.32</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/" class="autolink_findacts">Service and Execution of Process Act</a>, is money.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/index.html#p37" class="autolink_findacts">Part 37</a> r 3 refers
to, "a sum sufficient".  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/saeopa1992325/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 32(1)</a> refers to "allowances and travelling
expenses" being "paid or tendered".  However, I think it is also correct to say
that, if the
witness is provided with appropriate assurance that certain
expenses will not be incurred by him at all, then it is not necessary
to tender
those expenses.  That view has some confirmation in the case of<b>
</b><u>Castrucci v ACT Electricity Authority</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2094%20ACTR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 94 ACTR 1</a><b>. </b> 
<P>

27	However, it is insufficient merely to promise that expenses will be
reimbursed.  Accordingly, it seems to me that the actual
tender of an air
ticket would be an appropriate assurance that this expense of travel would not
be incurred at all.  The booking
of a witness into a hotel, with an appropriate
undertaking to pay being given, would in many circumstances be sufficient
assurance
to the witness that the expenses of accommodation would not be
incurred.
<P>

28	In this case, on that test it is quite plain that there was not an adequate
payment or tender of expenses, at least until the
dispatch and receipt of the
letter of 28th January 1999.  It was only then that it was made clear that the
witness could collect
air tickets at a particular point, that he had been
booked into a particular hotel, and that the expenses of that hotel would be
met.  There could be some question as to whether there was a sufficiently clear
and reliable undertaking given that the hotel expenses
would be paid, but on
the whole I believe the combination of the telephone conversation and the terms
of the letter did amount to
a sufficient assurance that the hotel accommodation
would be paid.  In addition, the tender of $30.00 and subsequently $140.00 was
in my opinion sufficient to cover any additional expenses.
<P>

29	That would leave the question whether the satisfaction of this requirement
by 28th January 1999 was satisfaction which occurred
a reasonable time before
the witness was to attend Court by means of travel commencing on 31st January
1999.  On the whole, having
regard to the totality of the communications, I
think it was satisfied a reasonable time before the witness was required to
attend
Court.
<P>

30	For those reasons, I believe the first basic requirement for the issue of a
warrant was satisfied. I should add that, for reasons
I will come to, I will
not immediately be issuing a warrant.  If the plaintiff can provide an answer
to the reasons which lead me
at present to refuse to issue a warrant, I should
say that I may wish to look in greater depth at this first issue; but at
present
my opinion is clearly as I have stated it.
<P>

31	The next question concerns the requirement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> that
it be proved that the non-appearance be "without just cause or reasonable
excuse".
<P>

32	It is possible that, as submitted for the plaintiff, the power given under
Pt.42 r.7 is independent of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194</a>, and can be exercised even if that
requirement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194</a> is not satisfied.  I do not decide that question one way
or the other, because in this particular case I would not be prepared to
act
under Pt.42, even if it were independent of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194</a>, if the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194</a>
were not satisfied.
<P>

33	It has been put on behalf of the plaintiff that the witness's evidence is
important, and I am prepared to accept that.  However,
it is plainly not of
central or crucial importance, and the plaintiff did not take the steps it
should have taken if it wished to
rely on the evidence.  Those steps which
should have been taken were to take all reasonable steps to obtain a statement
from the
witness, and if unable to obtain such statement to notify the
defendants of the intention to seek to lead the evidence orally and
of the best
statement the plaintiff could give of what that evidence would be; and to do so
within the time limited for witness statements,
or at the very least within a
time arranged at the pre-trial directions.  The plaintiff did not do this.  In
those circumstances
it seems to me that it cannot be said there would be
substantial injustice to the plaintiff if at the end of the day the evidence
is
not obtained.  It is for this reason , and also having regard to the
substantial impact on the witness of his being forcibly brought
from Queensland
to this Court in Sydney, that I am not prepared to act in this case without
proof of the requirement laid down by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s194.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.194.</a>
<P>

34	Turning to that requirement, it is clear that the onus is squarely on the
plaintiff to satisfy me that the witness has no just
cause or reasonable
excuse.  As submitted by the plaintiff, the circumstances of the issue of the
material from the doctor, plus
the fact that there had been no previous
suggestion from the witness of any illness, gives substantial grounds for
suspicion; but
I am still left with the situation where I have two letters,
purporting to be from a member of the medical profession, asserting
that there
are medical reasons why the witness could not comply with the subpoena.  I do
not think that at present I can be satisfied,
even on the balance of
probabilities, either (1) that Dr. Johnston is not a reputable member of his
profession who is aware of his
responsibilities in giving such an opinion and
has expressed an opinion honestly and conscientiously, or (2) that Dr Johnston
is
mistaken.
<P>

35	I leave aside at this stage the question of whether the satisfaction needs
to be beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of the
High Court decision in<b>
</b><u>Witham v Holloway</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 525.</a>  Even if it need only be on
the balance of probabilities, I would take the view that that balance of
probabilities must be based
on adequate material, produced by the party bearing
the onus of proof exercising reasonable diligence.
<P>

36	Beyond simply relying on the matters of suspicion to which I have referred,
and the absence of medical evidence in what might
be regarded as satisfactory
form, the plaintiff has not undertaken any steps to assist me in relation to
the two matters concerning
Dr. Johnston to which I have referred. In my opinion
it would be necessary for the plaintiff to undertake some investigation to
enable
an assessment to be made of the value of Dr. Johnston's opinion, at
least by attempting to obtain the witness's consent to the matter
being
discussed with Dr. Johnston, perhaps over the telephone; or by means of what
would be a far more satisfactory course, namely
to arrange for a conference
telephone link between Dr Johnston and the Court so that the two questions I
have identified could be
explored.  Such a course would also make it possible
to consider the question of when the witness might reasonably be expected to
be
able to attend, if in fact he is at present unable.
<P>

37	This judgment can be sent by facsimile to the witness, who could then be
requested to give consent to Dr. Johnston's assisting
the Court by answering
questions about his opinions and about the witness's medical condition.  If the
witness does not give this
consent, and I conclude that he is not co-operating
reasonably with attempts to inform the Court about this matter, I believe I
would
then be ready to draw the inference that the medical certificates are no
more than a ruse and that the witness has no just cause
or reasonable excuse
for not complying with the subpoena, in which case a basis for issuing the
warrant to have him brought to Sydney
would be made out.
<P>

38	This judgment may also be sent by facsimile to Dr. Johnston as well as to
the witness, so as to make him fully aware, if he is
not already aware, of the
considerable responsibility he is undertaking in expressing his opinions.
Assuming that he is a reputable
member of his profession, attempting to act
responsibly, conscientiously and honestly, he should be prepared (if his
patient consents)
to offer every reasonable cooperation in assisting the Court
to reach the correct decision on this matter.  If he shows himself as
not
prepared to do so, I may have to draw the inference that he is not acting
responsibly, conscientiously and honestly; and I may
in that event be prepared
to infer that the witness has no just cause or reasonable excuse, and to issue
a warrant that he be brought
forcibly to the Court.
<P>

39	Another possible outcome of clarification of the position with Dr. Johnston
is that it would appear that the witness is now,
or will at an identifiable
date in the near future, be able to attend Court.  If that happens, I may be
able to make orders with
a view to securing such attendance without at this
stage issuing a warrant. I may be prepared to appoint a time during the next
week
or two when his evidence could be taken.  I believe his evidence is such
that the case could otherwise be concluded, apart possibly
from brief evidence
in reply from the third defendant.
<P>

40	For those reasons, I will not at present further consider the question of
discretion or the question of the form of the warrant.
 If at some later stage
I am satisfied that a warrant should be issued, I will need to look into that
last question.
