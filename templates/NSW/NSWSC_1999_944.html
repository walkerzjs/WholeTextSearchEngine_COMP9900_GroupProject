<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 13 September 1999 the prisoner Helga
Dawney was  called for trial for the murder on or about 25 August 1998 of her
daughter Tenika
Kristi Dawney.  She pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter.  The Crown accepted her plea in discharge of the indictment
on
the basis that if the matter had gone to trial the prisoner would have
established the partial defence of substantial impairment
by abnormality of
mind, that is, that her capacity to understand events or judge whether her
actions were right or wrong or to control
herself was substantially impaired by
an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition and that the
impairment was so
substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced
to manslaughter.
<P>

2  	Since that was the first occasion on which the Crown had been
prepared to accept such a plea in discharge of the indictment,
the prisoner is
to be taken as having pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.
<P>

3  	The prisoner was born on 11 June 1969, the youngest of ten
children of her mother.  She grew up in a violent household.  Her
father was an
alcoholic who beat his wife and children and behaved inappropriately with
firearms.  The prisoner was sexually assaulted
by a brother when she was eight
or nine years old.  She was an anxious child.  Her memories of home until she
was thirteen or fourteen
years of age are vague and unhappy.  At that age she
had a fight with her mother and ran away to live with one of her sisters.
<P>

4  	She did not succeed at school and did not get on well with other
pupils.  She left unqualified part way through year nine. 
She did various
jobs, none of them for any length of time.
<P>

5  	She had a number of sexual relations with men, the first at
fourteen years of age.  When she was nineteen years old she lost
a baby.  She
married at 23, but the marriage failed after two and a half years, apparently
because the prisoner was unable then to
have children.
<P>

6  	Two weeks after the marriage ended she was raped by a man she had
known for a number of years.
<P>

7  	Some months later she was stabbed by yet another man.
<P>

8  	During 1993 and again early in 1994 she had a relationship with
Kenneth Robson, a man she had known since she was young.  During
the second
period of the relationship Tenika Dawney was conceived.  The relationship ended
before the child was born on 22 September
1994.
<P>

9  	The prisoner told Mr Robson that she was pregnant with his child,
but he did not believe her.  Even after the child was born,
he did not accept
that he was the father.  He moved away from the area in the course of his work
and did not return until 1997.
<P>

10  	The prisoner was having a good deal of difficulty managing the
child.  She was easily irritated when the child cried and the
child did not
thrive.  Officers of the Department of Community Services began to be concerned
about her welfare and were instrumental
in having the child fostered, first by
a sister of the prisoner and her husband and then by others.  Under the
supervision of officers
of the Department the child underwent an operation to
correct a turning eye.
<P>

11  	The prisoner did not always appreciate that others were acting
in the child's best interests.  She frequently attributed base
motives to them
and was abusive towards them.
<P>

12  	In January 1996 the child was returned to the prisoner from
Departmental care on condition that she underwent psychiatric assessment.
Accordingly, she was seen by Dr Diana Hamilton.  The prisoner told Dr Hamilton
that allegations that she had neglected the child
were without foundation, that
officers of the Department were proceeding on baseless accusations and that
neighbours, who had apparently
complained about her conduct, were "morons".
She described as manipulative the sister who had for a time fostered the
child.
<P>

13  	Dr Hamilton noted that the mood of the prisoner was irritable,
angry and labile.  She had limited frustration tolerance, was
difficult to
interview and generally unco-operative.  She appeared of average intelligence.
There was no evidence of psychosis and
Dr Hamilton thought that she was not
suffering from any psychiatric disorder.  She considered the prisoner a
particularly immature
and vulnerable woman who had limited skills coping and in
dealing with the stressors of parenthood.  Dr Hamilton noted the difficult
history of the prisoner and her overt hostility towards officers of the
Department.  She considered that there was a risk that the
prisoner could place
the child at further risk from future episodes of neglect.
<P>

14  	Dr Hamilton thought that formal psychiatric treatment would not
benefit the prisoner, but recommended regular counselling from
a social worker
or a psychologist to help her deal with motherhood and to help her cope with
her problems.
<P>

15  	In November 1997 the prisoner caused an order to be served on Mr
Robson requiring him to undergo a blood test.  He complied
and when he learned
the results he accepted that he was the child's father.  He attempted to gain
access to the child but was unsuccessful,
so he commenced court proceedings.
Although orders were made in the Local Court, Mr Robson never did gain access
to the child.
<P>

16  	During 1998 the prisoner enrolled the child in a child care
centre at Bilambil Heights.  Staff of the centre would collect
the child from
the prisoner and return her at the end of the day.  The child was made
available only irregularly.  Staff noticed
that the child looked and smelt
unwashed and had sores on her body.  They had to wash her.  They thought that
she was not being properly
looked after.
<P>

17  	In the meantime, Mr Robson had commenced proceedings in the
Family Court of Australia in Brisbane, apparently seeking a graduated
series of
orders leading towards an order that the child reside with him.
<P>

18  	As she prepared for the Family Court proceedings, the prisoner
asked the Acting Manager of the Department at Tweed Heads to
write a report for
the court as to the unsuitability of Mr Robson to have contact with the child.
She said that Mr Robson was dangerous,
possessed guns and dealt in drugs.  She
said that she would kill him.  It is unnecessary for me to decide whether any
of those claims
was true and sufficient to say that the prisoner appears to
have believed that what she was saying was true.
<P>

19  	One day in May 1998 the prisoner told one of the staff of the
child care centre, who was collecting her from the prisoner,
that she could
cope no longer with the court proceedings and that Mr Robson would have the
child within a couple of weeks.  She instructed
the staff member not to return
the child to her at the end of the day but to leave her at the police station.
She told another staff
member that she had already informed the Department
about this and that she wanted the child away from her father so that he could
not destroy her as he had destroyed the prisoner.  She said that she already
had one dead child and that this child might be better
off dead as well.  She
said that she was going to commit suicide.
<P>

20  	That was one of many occasions on which the prisoner threatened
to harm herself or the child.
<P>

21  	About one week before her daughter's death, the prisoner told a
departmental officer that she could not cope and needed respite
care for up to
a week.  As well as caring for her child, the prisoner was then engaged in a
business making lead lights and was breeding
fish.  She was also studying to
become a chef and had to put in a greater effort because she had missed some of
her studies.
<P>

22  	On 25 August 1998 a hearing was set down in the Family Court of
Australia, Brisbane.  The prisoner was then four months pregnant
to another
man.  She attended with the child and her mother, Mrs Grahame.  They travelled
to Brisbane together on a coach.  At court,
the Registrar stated an intention
to make an order for supervised access and asked Mrs Grahame whether she would
be the supervisor.
 She agreed.  Orders were made for Mr Robson to have access
under Mrs Grahame's supervision for the next three Saturdays.  The prisoner
was
very angry with her mother for having agreed to supervise access and very upset
about the orders.  She refused to return home
with her mother and she and the
child took a separate bus home.
<P>

23  	She returned to the house in Tweed Heads where she and the child
were living.  On the same night she was harbouring an unreasonable
but real
fear that Mr Robson was stalking her and trying to injure her, her property or
her child.  She telephoned the Federal Police
to ask for help.  She telephoned
the local police emergency service to ask for help.
<P>

24  	Between 8pm and midnight she smothered the child in her bed.
She spoke to nobody about the matter until she told her mother,
some time after
7pm on the following evening, what she had done.  In due course her mother told
the police and they attended the
house and found the dead child.  They also
found a crucifix and a rosary, which had been placed in the child's hand, and a
note,
which was in the following terms -
<P>

FROM the bottom of my heart Tenika I will always love &amp; protect you from
you Drugo bastard Father, he wanted you dead &amp;
I don't know how to protect
you but god will protect us both, I wish it was different but this the way it
has to be.  Lots of Love
Always &amp; 4 Eva in my heart Love you! your mum.
<P>

25  	On the reverse of the note were written these words -
<P>

REST IN PEACE I LOVE YOU XXXX
<P>

26  	The prisoner was arrested two days later.  She had superficial
slash marks on her wrists.  She was taken to the police station
and underwent a
formal interview.
<P>

27  	During the interview the prisoner told the police that she was
under too much pressure from what Mr Robson and the court were
doing and "lost
it".  She said that she accidentally strangled the child with her left hand,
when she was in bed screaming.  She
said that Mr Robson had told lies to the
court and was a drug addict.  She said that there was no way she would ever
give her child
to him.  She said that regardless of whether the child was alive
or dead, there was no way that he was going to have access.
<P>

28  	She said that after she had killed the child she walked around
in a daze and was bleeding from the wrists that she had slashed
at about the
same time.  She intended to die because she had had enough.  She wrote the note
that she left with the body after she
realised what she had done.  She was not
affected by drugs at the time.
<P>

29  	She denied any threats to take her own or the child's life.  She
denied threatening to kill Mr Robson.  She said that he had
wanted the child
dead as soon as he found out the results of the blood test and had gone to the
police station to get his guns. 
She said that there was no way that he would
ever get a chance of hurting the child.  She said that she had "snapped" at the
time
of killing the child because of the child's father, the family court
orders and what the Department and others had done with their
lies, pushing
their way into the lives of herself and the child, and taking the child from
her.  She said again that Mr Robson would
never see the child again because of
what he had done to the prisoner and referred to her having walked out on her
husband, having
been raped and having been treated badly by Mr Robson.  She
referred to him in extraordinarily derogative terms.
<P>

30  	By her plea of guilty, the prisoner has retreated from her claim
that she accidentally caused the death of the child.  There
is no doubt that
she intended to kill her.
<P>

31  	Since the prisoner has been in custody awaiting trial she has
been examined by a number of psychiatrists who have provided
reports for the
Court.  Each of the psychiatrists reported difficulty obtaining a consistent
and clear account from the prisoner
and remarked on the vituperative nature of
her complaints about others.  She appeared to them to be unable to attribute a
decent
motive to anyone else and to perceive any shortcoming in herself.
<P>

32  	The first psychiatrist to see her was Dr Westmore.  He
interviewed her on 17 April and 11 August 1999.  During their interviews
the
prisoner repeated her complaints about Mr Robson, said that he stalked her when
she was eight weeks pregnant and implied that
he had cut up her clothesline,
broken into the laundry and thrown things at her house.
<P>

33  	She denied having ever been aggressive to or neglectful of the
child.
<P>

34  	She told Dr Westmore that she was depressed and around the time
that her daughter died and was lucky to get one or two hours
sleep per night.
She said that the child was constantly wetting the bed at the time.  She was
studying and trying to work and to
cope with court cases as well.  She was also
pregnant.
<P>

35  	Dr Westmore asked the prisoner about comments she had previously
made to Associate Professor Hayes about hearing voices.  She
confirmed that she
did hear a voice and presumed that it was God.  She denied receiving messages
from the television or radio.
<P>

36  	Dr Westmore thought that she was intense, anxious and
despondent.  The detailed and complex way in which she spoke revealed
a
preoccupation with an extensive range of difficulties.  There were strong
themes of persecution in her thought content.
<P>

37  	However, Dr Westmore did not think that she was suffering from
hallucinations and concluded that she suffered from a personality
disorder with
paranoid and possibly borderline features.  He pointed to the history of
unstable interpersonal relationships, the
history of being the victim of sexual
abuse within and outside the family and to the violent abuse from her
father.
<P>

38  	Dr Westmore thought that there was no clear, consistent evidence
of a diagnosable mental illness, for example schizophrenia,
or a major
affective disorder, but thought that the prisoner's resources were overwhelmed
with the extended and extensive range of
stressors she was exposed to during
the time leading up to the death of the child.
<P>

39  	Dr Westmore's opinion was that the prisoner was at the time
suffering an abnormality of mind, namely a depressive illness.
 The abnormality
of mind arose from the depressive condition and would have substantially
impaired her capacity to control herself
at the time of the homicide.  He
thought that the underlying condition was likely to have been long term.
<P>

40  	Dr William Lucas saw the prisoner on 10 May, 3 June and 29 July
1999.  It was necessary to have three interviews because the
prisoner was
talkative, difficult to hold to the subject at hand and repeatedly returned to
things, not always relevant, that she
preferred to talk about.
<P>

41  	Dr Lucas observed that the prisoner had a number of beliefs of
an unusual nature about extrasensory perception, precognition,
"visions" and
voices.  He thought, however, that they were probably not psychotic phenomena
but overvalued and unusual ideas consistent
with a severe personality
disorder.
<P>

42  	He thought that the prisoner's personality disorder had mixed
features, borderline and schizotypal traits being prominent.
 He thought that
at the time she killed her daughter, the prisoner was subject to severe
stressors, including fears which to others
may have seemed unrealistic but
which because of the prisoner's personality were very real to her.  They
obviously influenced her
conduct.  For example, she telephoned the Federal
Police and the local police on the night after she returned from the Family
Court.
 He thought that there were good grounds to consider that due to her
personality disorder and depression, the prisoner's capacity
to understand
events, judge whether her actions were right or wrong or control herself were
to varying degrees impaired.  In his
opinion the impairment was substantial.
He thought that the underlying condition, namely the severe personality
disorder, was not
of a transient kind.
<P>

43  	Dr Rosalie Wilcox saw the prisoner on 2 and 16 August 1999.
Like the other psychiatrists, Dr Wilcox thought that the various
odd beliefs
the prisoner had were more overvalued ideas than true delusions.  She thought
that there was no schizophrenia.
<P>

44  	Dr Wilcox concluded that at the time of the death of the child
the prisoner was not suffering from a mental illness, though
she expressed a
number of bizarre beliefs.  She thought that the prisoner was depressed at the
relevant time and that her depression
was secondary to her persecutory
ideation.  She thought that the prisoner had a personality disorder that had
prominent schizotypal
and some borderline traits.  The schizotypal features
which were noted included the expression of odd beliefs, such as extrasensory
perception, her unusual perceptual experiences, the presence of speech that was
vague, circumstantial and overelaborate, her suspiciousness
and paranoid
ideation and her occasional inappropriate affect.  The borderline traits which
were observed included her pattern of
unstable interpersonal relationships, her
inappropriate intense anger and her affective instability, due to a marked
reactivity of
mood.
<P>

45  	Based upon her assessment of the prisoner and her reading of the
extensive documentation provided, Dr Wilcox concluded that
the prisoner was
suffering from an abnormality of mind, namely a severe personality disorder.
Dr Wilcox also thought that the prisoner's
depressed mood would have altered
her perception of her situation by causing her to see it as more hopeless than
it really was.
<P>

46  	She concluded that when she took her daughter's life the
prisoner was quite overwhelmed and did not have the personal resources
to deal
with her situation in a rational manner.  As a result, her capacity to
understand events and judge whether her actions were
right or wrong was
impaired to some degree, but her ability to control herself was substantially
impaired.
<P>

47  	Dr Delaforce wrote a report, which was tendered in evidence.  He
also gave oral evidence, which I found most helpful.  He saw
the prisoner on 3
September 1999.  He had had the benefit of reading the reports of the other
psychiatrists.  He also administered
tests to the prisoner.  He thought that
there were no psychotic features present.  The results of the Beck Depression
Inventory Second
Edition placed her into the severest range of major
depression.  The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III showed an
exaggeration
of her emotional problems as a consequence of her tendency to
self-deprecation.  The paranoia, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress,
major
depression and delusional disorder scales were elevated.
<P>

48  	Dr Delaforce diagnosed moderate chronic major depressive
disorder which, he stated, was consistent with the prisoner's results
in the
two tests he had administered.  He did not substantiate a diagnosis of any of
the specific personality disorders, but identified
significant paranoid,
borderline and schizotypal personality traits.
<P>

49  	He thought that at the time of the child's death the prisoner
had experienced a severe level of stressors for a number of months
and during
her lifetime overall.  They included her difficulties managing her daughter,
for example, when she would not settle during
the night and when she repeatedly
wet the bed, the continued conflicts with Mr Robson, including the Family Court
proceedings, her
fears of being stalked and her attempts to catch up with her
studies.  She had attempted to get help from others.  For example, she
had told
the departmental worker as late as one week prior to the death that she could
not cope and needed respite care.  She made
it clear to others, too, for
example the employees of the child care centre, that she could not cope.  She
wanted her daughter put
in a safe place to protect her from what she perceived
as the danger presented by Mr Robson's imminent access to her.
<P>

50  	On 25 August 1998 stress was heightened because of the orders
made in the Family Court.  The prisoner had a serious argument
with her mother.
Subsequently, fearing that she was again being stalked and that she or her
daughter might be killed or kidnapped,
she again sought help by telephoning the
Federal Police and the New South Wales police.
<P>

51  	Dr Delaforce thought that there were two categories of motive in
child homicide which were relevant, namely killings in retaliation
and
altruistic killings.  Although he thought that one aspect of the prisoner's
personality traits was her tendency to seek revenge,
he did not regard revenge
against Mr Robson as the significant aspect of the homicide.  He thought the
altruistic aspect more important.
<P>

52  	In the altruistic homicide of a child, the parent perceives the
killing to be in the child's best interest, that is, that the
best solution at
the time is to kill the child.  Although this was not an obvious case, such as
where a child suffers a severe and
painful medical condition or a terminal
illness, nevertheless the altruistic aspect applied because of the prisoner's
fears, which
he thought genuine, for the welfare of the child should Mr Robson
have contact with her.  Such a type of altruistic killing, he said,
is more
common in women and is often associated with a depressive disorder, which can
severely change a person's thinking and behaviour.
<P>

53  	Dr Delaforce concluded that when she killed her daughter, the
prisoner had an abnormality of mind arising from underlying conditions,
namely
the major depressive disorder and the personality disorder.  Those conditions
had both been present virtually throughout the
adult life of the prisoner and
were therefore not transitory.  As a result of the abnormality of mind arising
from those underlying
conditions, there was a substantial impairment in her
capacity to understand events, or judge whether her actions were right or
wrong,
or to control herself.  Dr Delaforce thought that she probably had a
sincere and genuine belief that her daughter would be better
off dead rather
than have contact visits with her father.
<P>

54  	When an offender is being sentenced who was suffering from an
abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, considerations
of general
deterrence and retribution may be less weighty than in the ordinary case.
<b><u>R v Engert</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2084%20A%20Crim%20R%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 84 A Crim R 67</a> per Gleeson CJ at 71.  See also
the references at that page to <b><u>R v Scognamiglio</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 56 A Crim
R 81</a> at 86 and <b><u>R v Letteri</u></b> Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 March
1992, unreported per Badgery-Parker J.  But it all depends on the circumstances
of the individual
case.  The existence of a causal relationship between a
mental disorder and the commission of an offence does not automatically mean
that an offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of
such a causal connection produces an automatically
greater sentence.  For
example, the existence of a causal connection between a mental disorder and an
offence might reduce the importance
of general deterrence and increase the
importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public.
<b><u>R v Engert</u></b> at 71.
<P>

55  	The abnormality of mind which affected the prisoner
substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her act but did not
negate
responsibility.  The reduction in her capacity for self-control or to judge
whether her action was right or wrong reduced
her responsibility but did not
excuse her act.
<P>

56  	Any sentence to be imposed must recognise the objective
seriousness of the offence, notwithstanding the substantial impairment
of that
capacity, and in particular that what was here involved was the felonious
taking of human life with intent to kill.
<P>

57  	In February 1999 the prisoner gave birth to a daughter who is
now being cared for by relatives.  She told Dr Delaforce that
she continued her
determination to fight to overcome men abusing women and children.  She said
that since the birth of her daughter
she was not sure whether to accept her
daughter being cared for by her relatives or to fight to get her back.  If she
decided to
fight to get her back, she said, "The law will not stop me getting
my daughter back".
<P>

58  	She also said that she continued to have people protecting her,
whom she would not name, so that Mr Robson might be "marked
for death" if the
news media reported unfavourably about her during her forthcoming murder
trial.
<P>

59  	These two threats were matters of considerable concern to Dr
Delaforce, who thinks that as things stand it would be dangerous
for the
prisoner to be released from prison.  That risk arises because the prisoner
might try to get her daughter back, with consequent
danger to the daughter and
those having the care of her, and might try to exact revenge on Mr Robson.
<P>

60  	Dr Delaforce also stressed that the legal circumstances
surrounding the care of the new daughter need to be settled.  It would
be
dangerous, I infer, to release the prisoner into an environment in which she
could become bound up in a fight for control of the
child.
<P>

61  	Therapy, Dr Delaforce said, is necessary because the prisoner is
a very angry woman.  Her anger derives from all the stresses
of her life, the
most important being the spontaneous termination of her pregnancy in 1988, the
break up of her marriage, the rape
and the stabbing.  Those were circumstances
she complained about over and over again.  She is chronically and severely
depressed
and must be allowed to work through her anger and desperation so as
to be able to accept her losses and, when she is released from
prison, accept
as settled the circumstances in which her daughter is cared for.
<P>

62  	Shortly before he gave his evidence, Dr Delaforce had had a
telephone conversation with the psychologist at the prison where
the prisoner
is now kept, Miss Straede.  He had some knowledge of the work being done by
Miss Straede before he spoke to her.  He
reported in very favourable terms
about the results of her work and commended her for the progress she had
achieved so far in modifying
the prisoner's attitudes.  He observed that she
was the first therapist the prisoner had learned to trust.  However, he
observed
that there was much more that needed to be done before safety could be
achieved.
<P>

63  	Dr Delaforce was unable to say how long that might take but
that, given the continuation of the work of Miss Straede and the
co-operation
of the prisoner, a lot of therapy within one year could make a lot of
difference.  If there were less therapy or less
effective therapy, of course,
longer would be required.
<P>

64  	It is not clear how long Miss Straede has been the prisoner's
therapist.  However, she is willing to continue in this role
and the signs seem
encouraging.
<P>

65  	I do not understand Dr Delaforce to be suggesting that a single
year will be enough to achieve the fundamental change in the
prisoner that will
be necessary before she can safely be allowed into the community again.
Although I accept the importance of more
recent events in shaping the attitude
of the prisoner, for example the four events on which Dr Delaforce places
emphasis, I do not
think that they are the only events that have affected her.
I think that the important events of her unhappy and violent childhood,
for
example the misbehaviour of her father and her brother, contributed to her
personality disorder, particularly her persecutory
ideation, and to her major
depressive disorder.  In view of her entrenched attitude, as revealed by such
vehement complaints to so
many people on so many occasions it is obvious that a
substantially greater time than one year will be needed.
<P>

66  	The minimum term of the sentence I impose must take account of
that consideration.
<P>

67  	At a number of points in their reports the psychiatrists
remarked upon the inappropriate affect of the prisoner, showing great
anger and
concern for some matters and apparent unconcern for others chief among which
was the death of her child.  That might give
rise to the impression that the
prisoner has no regrets for what she has done.  Dr Delaforce thinks that she is
remorseful for having
taken the life of her daughter.  He thinks her genuine in
speaking of the pain she suffers, knowing that she has killed her friend.
 I
accept this evidence.
<P>

68  	The prisoner is therefore entitled to the full benefit of her
early plea of guilty, not only because it has spared the community
the time of
a trial but because it is evidence of her remorse.
<P>

69  	The prisoner has no other convictions.
<P>

70  	After she is released at the expiration of her minimum term of
imprisonment, the prisoner will need an extended period on parole
in order to
assist her rehabilitation and to put into effect in the community the attitudes
which will by then have been established
during psychological therapy.
<P>

71  	The minimum and additional terms of the sentence I impose will
take account of that need and the need to ensure that the prisoner
will not be
released into the community until she has ceased to be a danger.
<P>

72  	I direct that a copy of this judgment, of the report of Dr
Delaforce of 8 September 1999, and of a transcript of the evidence
he gave on
14 September 1999 be sent to the Parole Board so as to give the Board an
opportunity, when considering whether the prisoner
should be released on
parole, to review the progress that has been made towards a solution to the
problem of her dangerousness.
<P>

73  	Helga Dawney, I sentence you to penal servitude for eight years.
The sentence will comprise a minimum term of five years, commencing
on 28
August 1998 and expiring on 27 August 2003 and an additional term of three
years.  You will be eligible for release on parole
on 27 August 2003.
<P>
