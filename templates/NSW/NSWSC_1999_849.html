<b>JUDGMENT (Plaintiff's application for adjournment)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  By a Notice of Motion, which I will grant
leave to file in Court today, the plaintiff seeks the following orders:
first,
that the date fixed for the resumption of the trial of these proceedings be
adjourned to 15 November 1999;  second, that following
evidence in chief and
cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses on damage and following any
evidence-in-chief of the plaintiff,
that there be an adjournment of the trial
until Monday 31 January 2000.
<P>

2   	The present state of the fixtures in relation to this
action is that on and from 18 October time is available for the disposition
of
any outstanding interlocutory matters.  The resumption of the trial is
presently fixed for 1 November.  On its face, therefore,
given that no
application is made in relation to the period commencing 18 October, all that
is at stake here is a two week adjournment
of the trial.  
<P>

3   	The application is made by Mr Marsden in person.  The
circumstances in which that comes about can be summarised as consequential
to
Orders made on 18 August 1999, namely yesterday afternoon, by the Court of
Appeal.  Those orders were:
<P>

<i>"1.	Subject to orders 2 and 3, grant leave to appeal.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Stay execution of orders 1 to 3 made by Levine J on 28 June 1999 until
further order or disposal of the appeal.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Subject to the opponent's solicitor's undertaking to repay the money if
the Court of Appeal should set aside the said orders of
Levine J, order the
claimant to pay $240,000 on account of the opponents' entitlement to costs
under those orders, such payment to
be amenable to an order for restitution in
the event that those orders are set aside. Payment is to be made within 14
days.</i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>4.	Subject to further order, direct that the hearing of the appeal stand
over until the conclusion of the trial.</i>
<P>

<i>Reynolds SC announced that his instructing solicitor would not give the
undertaking.  Later in the President's chambers, the President
explained to
Reynolds SC and Nicholas QC that the undertaking referred to is that discussed
in<b> Barrs v  Crossman &amp; Prichard</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281897%29%20AC%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1897) AC 172."</a></i>
<P>

4   	The material I have just recited is from a document, copies
of which will be provided to the bar table, provided to me from
the chambers of
the President during the course of the adjournment. 
<P>

5   	Consequent upon the plaintiff's solicitor not giving the
undertaking, the retaining by Mr Marsden of Mr Potter and his firm
has come to
an end and, in due course, the appropriate documentation will be filed in the
registry.
<P>

6   	With respect to the fixture commencing on 18 October, I am
informed by Mr Marsden that Mr Reynolds S.C. has agreed to appear
for him in
relation to outstanding interlocutory matters on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.  It
is in relation to the trial, as I understand it, that Mr Marsden has been
unable to obtain counsel.  In the event that
the application to adjourn the
trial for two weeks is granted, I am informed by Mr Marsden that either he will
have counsel or he
will proceed to act for himself.
<P>

7   	On 5 May 1998 I ordered expedition of these proceedings.
On 18 September 1998 I made orders fixing the dates for the commencement
of the
proceedings.  On page 5 of my judgment of that date (DLJ 4) I stated something
which historically must now be regarded as
one of the most misconceived
judicial utterances in the context of defamation litigation.  What I said
was:
<P>

<i>"These cases are fixed for the second week of term to enable the first week
to be available to tie up any interlocutory loose ends."</i>
<P>

8   	As at 28 June 1999 the interlocutory loose ends were tidied
up to the extent that the substantive application by the defendant
for leave to
amend its defence had been disposed of.  Recent communications with the
solicitors hitherto on the record indicate at
least 13 other interlocutory
loose ends to be tidied up.
<P>

9   	Be all that as it may, nothing, in my view, has happened in
the extraordinary course of this case to derogate from the anxiety
of the
plaintiff to pursue vindication or, presumably, the desire in the defendant to
vindicate its exercise of free speech.
<P>

10   	What confronts me this morning is an application to
adjourn for two weeks.
<P>

11   	The trial began in the second week of term 1999 and it
must not be forgotten the jury has already found the plaintiff to have
been
defamed by the defendant.
<P>

12   	It is argued for the defendant that the plaintiff's
application should not succeed in the light of there being advanced no
real or
compelling reason for granting it.  The defendant, and I accept this to be the
case, proposes to call a great number of witnesses,
some under its direct
control, others strangers to it, in respect of whom, no doubt, arrangements
have been made throughout the year
so far for their attendance to give
testimony at the appropriate time.
<P>

13   	I understand the position of the plaintiff to be, no
doubt, that similar arrangements have been made in  relation to witnesses
on
the issue of reputation, in respect of which the number of 30 odd has been
mentioned from time to time and, presumably, witnesses
in defence of the case
to be brought by the defendant on justification of the imputations found by the
jury.
<P>

14   	One would think that little difficulty should be
encountered in disposing of the issue of whether or not the resumption of
this
trial should be delayed by two weeks. There is, however, lurking in the
forensic background a question of the structure of the
trial upon its
resumption. That the structure of the trial would be the subject of an
application by the plaintiff has been foreshadowed
for some time.  The essence
of the restructuring, as I understand it, and have understood it, is to bring
about the situation whereby
the plaintiff would not be cross-examined on the
issue of truth until after the defendant had presented its case on that issue.
The
suggestion has been made, from time to time that, in effect, the plaintiff
is in the position of an accused, or a defendant, in a
criminal prosecution and
that he should not suffer any disadvantage in the light of that by reason of
this being a civil action for
damages for defamation.
<P>

15   	I have mentioned this matter lurking in the background
because it has been stated by Mr Marsden that that still is his position.
 The
defendant, through Mr Nicholas Q.C., has stated its position that the normal
flow of this case should not be disrupted by an
adjournment which may be
perceived in reality as seeking to achieve the end to which I have referred,
the more so when any application
has not yet been made by the plaintiff.
<P>

16   	As I indicated during the course of argument this morning,
the first interlocutory matter that will be dealt with on 18 October
is any
application the plaintiff wishes to make in relation to the structure of the
trial.  I think it fair to observe, at this stage,
that there are three
options:
<P>

1.	the plaintiff technically could close his case now;
<P>

2. 	the plaintiff can run the case in the normal way that a defamation action
or a civil action would be run, or
<P>

3.	make an application of the kind to which I have referred.
<P>

17   	It is the uncertainty in relation to the structure of the
trial that I feel underlies the rigorous opposition by the defendant
to the
relief the plaintiff seeks this morning.  No doubt there are tactical and
forensic considerations close to the defendant's
litigious heart that also
drive its attitude towards this application.
<P>

18   	Mr Marsden, upon the withdrawal of Mr Potter, his
solicitor, made an impassioned and emotional address to the court, raising
matters, he says, that have affected him personally in this litigation and that
have affected his capacity to retain lawyers and
the like.  I have noted (and
it has been recorded) what he has said.
<P>

19   	In the light of the history of this litigation, which goes
back to 1995, and what I  know of it by reason of my connection
with it since
that time, and not intending anything personal in relation to Mr Marsden, in
the light of what happened yesterday in
the Court of Appeal and what has
happened in the course of this year, that a person in the position of Mr
Marsden should be moved
to make the kind of statement he made this morning
comes as no surprise to me and should come as no surprise to anyone.
<P>

20   	It is absolutely essential that this litigation reach
finality, a state or event which I understand to be sought by each side.
 But,
to put it bluntly, I do not see how the deferring, by two weeks, of the
resumption of this trial in November would adversely
affect the interests of
the defendant and can adversely affect the administration of the list of this
Court again to put it bluntly,
I cannot see it otherwise than being patently
clear that fairness and justice requires that Mr Marsden be given these two
weeks.
<P>

21   	It must be made clear, however, that there is no room for
manoeuvre in relation to the period set aside from 18 October to
deal with
outstanding interlocutory matters.  It must also be made clear that upon the
resumption of this trial on 15 November it
will proceed, with Mr Marsden acting
for himself or with counsel.
<P>

22   	I cannot guess as to what the outcome of any application,
if an application is made to restructure the trial, will be, nor
would it be
prudent to prognosticate on the effect of any such outcome upon the trial which
will recommence on 15 November.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff has had the benefit, if I might say so, of
legal representation of the highest order.  Indeed, the Court, in
the conduct
of this litigation, as far as both sides are concerned, has had the benefit of
legal representation of the highest order.
 Appreciating the realities to which
Mr Marsden referred in his address to the Court about the horrendous costs that
are incurred
in litigation of this kind, I can do no more than state my fervent
hope that the plaintiff will be in a position to have representation,
first,
and secondly, hopefully representation of quality and experience which the
demands of this litigation will require.
<P>

24   	I am sure that Mr Marsden, by reason of his lengthy
experience as a practitioner and officer of this Court, will understand
that if
it comes about that he appears in person, he will obtain no advantage thereby;
he will be bound by the same rules as apply
to legal practitioners (and he
happens to be one).  But the stakes in this case are high and its efficient
conduct will be served
if representation can be obtained.  As I have said, if
at 15 November there is not any legal representation, the trial will still
go
on.
<P>

25   	A direction that I will now give is that on 18 October the
plaintiff must move the Court for any orders sought that affect
the structure
of the trial and, on that occasion, in accordance with the practice hitherto
adopted, a Notice of Motion will have
to be ready to be filed, a copy should be
sent to the defendant's solicitors before hand, together with any affidavit
evidence upon
which reliance will be placed. That application, if it is to be
made, could by its resolution, of course, have immense impact upon
the balance
of the  conduct of the trial.
<P>

26   	I make no comment as to the 12 or 13 other outstanding
matters.  Directions have already been given as to the exchange of
witness
lists.
<P>

27   	<b>PLAINTIFF</b>:  That's only in relation to damages, as
I understand.
<P>

28   	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  I suppose there may be further
argument about discovery, about documents, even about particulars and the like,
but the point has
been reached where the preoccupation with paper must be
reined in, to say the least, and attention turned to the people who are going
to be involved in this trial.
<P>

29   	There is one other thing it is desirable to make clear, at
this stage, absent any decision upon any application the plaintiff
makes on 18
October. As far as this Court is concerned the time available for the
continuation of the trial is from 15 November to
the end of term and it will
recommence in the normal course of events on 31 January 2000, the first day of
term next year.
<P>

30   	I assume that Mr Marsden will have the benefit of a record
of orders made.
<P>

31   	The granting of the adjournment arises acutely from the
situation that developed yesterday afternoon and this morning where
the status
of the plaintiff, vis-a-vis his lawyers, and thus the status of the plaintiff
as the litigant in opposition to the defendant
reached a point to which the
roller coaster history of this matter in 1999 almost rendered arrival
inevitable.
<P>

32   	The circumstances of the whole of this case are peculiar.
The circumstances attending the plaintiff personally, arising yesterday,
are,
of course, very recent and I have viewed them in the context of matters raised
by his former solicitors as to problems with
representation.  As I have said,
just looking at this matter this morning, in the light of those developments I
cannot see any basis,
in the fairness and justice, to refuse the application,
and I grant it.
<P>

33   	The question of costs is reserved.
