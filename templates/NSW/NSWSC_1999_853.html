FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<b>50032 of 1999 TELSTRA CORPORATION LIMITED v. </b>
<P>

<b>AAPT LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Telstra as plaintiff claims various remedies against
AAPT for misrepresentations and misleading or deceptive conduct
in relation to
arrangements with telephone subscribers to transfer their long distance and
overseas telephone service from Telstra
to AAPT.  Telstra claims declarations
establishing the conduct which has occurred, mandatory orders for remedial
measures and an
order permanently restraining the misrepresentations and
conduct. AAPT does not dispute that there ought to be an injunction under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.80</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> to restrain misrepresentation and misleading
and deceptive conduct. Telstra's claim for damages was left for future
determination
and will be referred to arbitration. 
<P>

2  	The misrepresentations and conduct relate to AAPT smartChat, a
telephone service provided to residential customers and marketed
door to door
and in shopping centres through AAPT's dealer network, by sales staff of
dealers.  AAPT authorised its dealers to introduce
business; the dealers were
entitled to commissions related to the business produced by the customers they
introduced.  The entitlements
of dealers' sales staff depended on their
arrangements with the dealers.  Neither dealers nor their staff were employed
by AAPT in
a contract of service, and, while AAPT made detailed directions for
what dealers were to do in their approaches to customers, and
sent dealers
streams of messages of advice, exhortation and direction, AAPT's means of
control were enforcement of the conditions
on which commissions were payable,
so that if dealers did not comply they risked not earning commissions; and AAPT
could also terminate
their authorisation as dealers.
<P>

3  	After many decades during which Telstra and its predecessors were
the only suppliers of telephone services, legislative changes
meant that from
1992 Optus Communications was also a supplier of services, and then from 1 July
1997 AAPT and other suppliers entered
the market.  AAPT has other business
apart from its smartChat residential service.  Business obtained for smartChat
through dealers
was necessarily obtained by the customer's transferring
business from another supplier; in the great majority of cases, from Telstra.
There have been large flows of business between Telstra and AAPT, as customers
change their supplier of long-distance services: these
flows are referred to in
the industry as churns, and do not always move in favour of AAPT.  There are
lesser flows between other
suppliers.
<P>

4  	A subscriber may obtain smartChat  service in either of two ways.
In the first, the customer only becomes a customer of  AAPTs
for each call for
which an override code,1414, is dialled before dialling the number to be
called. Only calls for which the override
code had been used would be billed to
AAPT; other calls would continue to be billed to the customer's preselected
carrier.  Alternately
the customer could agree to be preselected to AAPT for
long distance and overseas calls, in which case all long distance and overseas
calls initiated by the subscriber were billed by AAPT and automatically carried
by AAPT's equipment, or by equipment which AAPT had
arranged with Telstra to
use.  A preselected customer of AAPT may use the service of Telstra or any
other supplier with which the
customer has an arrangement by dialling that
supplier's override code, but in default of doing so will use the preselected
service.
 
<P>

5  	When AAPT entered the market with smartChat on 1 July 1997
preselection was not available at all locations throughout Australia.
Progressively since then, preselection has become almost universally available.
It is not AAPT's commercial objective to obtain business
through override
dialling; its commercial objective is to obtain preselected customers.  No
doubt business obtained through the override
code is acceptable. 
<P>

6  	It is clear on the evidence and from admissions made by AAPT and
it is not disputed that misrepresentations were made to many
persons who signed
applications for AAPT's smartChat service about the effect of signing the
application form and using the override
code.  The admitted particulars in Pt.C
Summary of the Plaintiff's Contentions in the Amended Summons are as
follows:
<P>

<i>"4.	In the course of engaging in the conduct referred to above, AAPT has
made to persons whose custom it has solicited, one or more
of the following
representations, being representations made in trade and commerce to the
following or similar effect (`<b>the Representations</b>');</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	that if the Telstra customer signs a form proffered by or on behalf of
AAPT, which constitutes an authority from the Telstra customer
to AAPT to
transfer his or her long distance telephone custom to AAPT (`<b>the Application
Form'</b>), the Telstra customer will remain with Telstra and Telstra will
continue to supply long distance services;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that if the Telstra customer signs the Application Form they will not be
transferring their services from Telstra to AAPT, but
will be able to acquire
AAPT services by dialling a four digit override code (`<b>the AAPT override
code'</b>) and will otherwise automatically continue to acquire long distance
services from Telstra;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	that the only effect of signing the Application Form is to enable the
Telstra customer to access the AAPT Services by means of
the AAPT override
code;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	that if the Telstra customer signs the Application Form, he or she will
be authorising a creditworthiness check which is a necessary
pre-requisite to
being able to use the AAPT override code should he or she wish to acquire the
AAPT Services;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	that the only effect of signing the Application Form is to enable the
Telstra customer to be placed on a mailing list or otherwise
to enable him ro
her to receive further information about the AAPT Services;</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	that the purpose of completing the Application Form is to conduct a
market survey;</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	that the Application Form is an authority for the Telstra customer to
obtain a discount on his or her telephone bill without altering
their
relationship with Telstra;</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	that the Application Form does no more than signify that an AAPT
representative has visited the Telstra customer;</i>
<P>

<i>(k)	that AAPT's prices for long distance telephone services:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	are always or unconditionally cheaper than Telstra's prices for long
distance telephone services;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	are cheaper than Telstra' prices by a specified percentage or
amount;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	are such that the customer's long distance telephone charges would be
always or unconditionally lower with AAPT than Telstra;</i>
<P>

<i>where that is not so or where the comparison is with Telstra's standard
(undiscounted) charges or where the comparison does not take
into account all
Telstra discounts applicable to the customer;</i>
<P>

<i>(l)	that Telstra charges a specified price, which specified price is
incorrect or out of date or otherwise not representative of the
actual Telstra
price;</i>
<P>

<i>(m)	that, in relation to the supply of long distance telephone services,
AAPT is affiliated with, part of, represents or is working
with Telstra in
promoting or supplying such services;</i>
<P>

<i>(n)	that an Application Form can be signed by any person other than the
customer in whose name the account is held with the existing
supplier of
telephone services or an authorised representative of the customer who is
registered as such;</i>
<P>

<i>(o)	(when a customer complains to AAPT that he or she has been misled into
signing an Application Form and the customer's preselected
long distance
telephone services supplier has changed from Telstra to AAPT) that the
customer's preselection of AAPT can only be
reversed and transferred back to
Telstra for long distance telephone services if the customer presents to
Telstra a carrier authority
or similar form authorising the transfer;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(p)	(when a customer complains to AAPT that he or she has been misled into
signing an Application Form) that the customer will be
taken to have given the
authority set out in the Application Form, notwithstanding that his or her
signature on the Application Form
may have been induced by a belief that they
only signed the form in order to become eligible to use AAPT's override code
when making
long distance telephone calls, or for some purpose other than the
transfer of the customer's long distance telephone service supplier
to
AAPT.</i>
<P>

Subparagraphs (g) and (j) were withdrawn.
<P>

7  	The misleading conduct was very widespread and instances occurred
throughout the period of sales activity, which began in October
1997 and were
still continuing to occur when the proceedings were commenced in March 1999.
Evidence including customer affidavits
shows patterns of the misrepresentations
and conduct complained of which must have occurred many more times than are
actually illustrated
by the evidence of customers; the breaches were widespread
geographically, and occurred over the whole period of sales activity,
and they
were widespread among dealers. AAPT is responsible for the conduct of dealers
and the staff of dealers for the purposes
of obligations and remedies under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>; see subs.84(2).  AAPT's responsibility is not the
less because those persons were less closely integrated into its organisation
than its own management and employed staff.
<P>

8  	AAPT has engaged in unlawful practices and the object of the
injunction is to restrain AAPT from engaging in them again - cf.
<b>Mikasa
(NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Stores (</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1972/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1972%29%20127%20CLR%20617" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1972) 127 CLR 617</a> at 651 (Gibbs J).  An
injunction restraining conduct is supported by severe penalties and is not a
slight or restrained response
to breaches of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>.
Conduct of the kinds admitted ought to be restrained by injunction and it is
not sufficient to leave the matters complained of to
be remedied only by
damages.  The need for an injunction is clear from the nature of the conduct,
and AAPT did not dispute this.
<P>

9  	The power of the court conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.80</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act 1974</a> extends to mandatory orders for remedial measures.  "<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 80</a> is
essentially a public interest provision" - per Lockhart J in <b>ICI v Trade
Practices Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/474.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 474</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2038%20FCR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 38 FCR 248</a> at 255.  The power is not punitive.
The interests of the consumers, in this case those who may have become
preselected AAPT customers
through misrepresentation or misleading and
deceptive conduct, are the primary focus of public interest considerations
affecting
a decision whether to order remedial measures.  
<P>

10  	The power has been held to extend to support an order for
corrective advertising.  See <b>Janssen Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty
Ltd</b> (1986) 80 PR 40-654 at 47, 295.  Corrective advertising was also
ordered in <b>HCF Australia Ltd v Switzerland Australia Health Fund Pty Ltd</b>
(1988) ATPR 40-834.  See too <b>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
v Optell Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20ATPR%2041%2d640" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) ATPR 41-640</a> at 41,087.  No doubt an order
for a corrective letter is just as much within power as an order for corrective
advertising.  A mandatory
order requiring remedial measures is not made as of
course, and must be based on some grounds of sufficient weight to justify the
intervention.
<P>

11  	Telstra claims that there should also be mandatory orders which
would control in detail important aspects of AAPT's internal
management and its
methods of communicating with its customers and potential customers. These are
based on contentions that the matters
complained of do not arise only out of
delinquent behaviour of dealers and dealers' staff engaged in contact with
potential customers,
at customers' homes and in shopping centres, but out of
the working system or method of operation of AAPT itself.  
<P>

			
<P>

12  	The injunction claimed by the Plaintiff  restraining
misrepresentations is set out in Claim 1 of the Amended Summons.  (The
claims
for interlocutory relief were adopted in claim 7 for permanent restraint).
This would restrain misrepresentations about:
<P>

(a)	the effect of the form, 
<P>

(b)	AAPT's prices in comparison with Telstra's prices,
<P>

(c)	Telstra's prices
<P>

(d)	the relationship between AAPT and Telstra
<P>

(e)	who may sign an application 
<P>

(f)	difficulties of changing back to a customers original long distance carrier
; and
<P>

(g)	the effect of a signature on an application form induced by
misrepresentation.
<P>

The only contested question on this restraint related to a matter of detail.
Telstra claims that in the introductory words the restraint
should be directed
to "<i>AAPT by itself, its servants, agents, dealers, representatives or
otherwise"</i> whereas AAPT's draft would limit the reference to <i>AAPT "by
itself, its servants or agents"</i>.  In my view the long-established formula
for injunctions should be followed, as the introduction of references to
dealers and representatives
is unlikely to achieve any greater clarity and may
give rise to doubt about the established application of the formula.  
<P>

13  	During argument I raised the question whether the order should
be permanent or should be made for a limited term of years.
 It can be expected
that the telecommunications industry will have a long future and that these
parties will be present in it for
a very long time.  Serious as the matters
admitted are, a time can be foreseen when they could not have any continuing
impact on
the conduct of customers or on the rights of Telstra. The industry is
characterised by large and rapid change.  I am of the view
that an injunction
which is to operate permanently would exceed what justice requires.  In my
judgment the appropriate time for the
restraint to have effect is five years
from 19 March 1999, the date of Rolfe J's order; after five years the events
which have been
proved and admitted cannot reasonably be expected to have any
continuing impact. 
<P>

14  	The orders sought in Claim 2 in the Summons would exercise
detailed control over the application forms to be used by AAPT.
 Claim 2(a)(i)
would restrain AAPT from providing to customers or obtaining a customer's
signature on an application form which purported
to be an application to
acquire long distance telephone services by use of AAPT's override code.
Exhibit A, which is the form used
after July 1998, is not an application to use
the override code. 
<P>

15  	Claim 2(a)(ii) is specifically directed to forbidding use of a
form which requires the customer to indicate affirmatively that
the customer
does not elect preselection; however I see nothing wrong with the use of such a
form, or with calling for the customer
to indicate affirmatively an election
against preselection.  Offering a choice in that way would have no harmful
effect unless it
were misrepresented.
<P>

16  	From July 1998 AAPT used the application form in Exhibit A; the
form that had been used previously was withdrawn, though it
was used thereafter
in a few cases.  The form in Exhibit A is reasonably clear when used by a
person who gives attention to what
it says.  Its heading names AAPT smartChat
and calls itself<i> "Application for Service</i>".  The first statement in its
text is "You must dial 1414 before all national and international long distance
numbers until we notify
you otherwise."  After spaces for details of the
customer's name, contact telephone numbers, identification by driver's licence
and
date of birth and some particulars of the customer's addresses, there is a
box headed "<i>Connection details</i>" introduced by the text "<i>write your
telephone and facsimile numbers in the boxes below, signifying AAPT Limited
ACN052 082 416 (AAPT) as your preferred choice
of telephone company for long
distance calls</i>."  Then in a box which the customer is to sign is the
following: 
<P>

<b><i>"Acknowledgment and authority to change long distance telephone
company.</i></b>
<P>

<i>I acknowledge that AAPT will bill me for national and international long
distance calls (including calls to mobile phones when available)
from the line
(s) listed above.</i>
<P>

<i>1.	AAPT will provide me with services subject to its Terms and Conditions
overleaf, which I have read and understood.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	I have the authority to make this change and that these details are
correct.  I understand that, after this request has been processed
AAPT will
supply both international and national long distance calls (including calls to
mobiles when available) for the nominated
telephone numbers above.</i>
<P>

3.	<i>I authorise preselection to AAPT for services when available."</i>
<P>

	The form also said, prominently, "<i>This contract is subject to a cooling-off
period of 10 days".</i>
<P>

17  	A person who gave attention to the terms of the Application Form
Exhibit A and then signed it would not reasonably understand
that the telephone
service was not going to be preselected to AAPT, and would not reasonably
believe that it was only if the override
code were dialled that AAPT services
would be used.  It is only if there were a positive misrepresentation about the
effect of the
form that a person would think that by signing the form he would
gain the option of using AAPT Services by dialling the override
code, but that
otherwise his arrangements for long distance telephone service would remain
unchanged, with Telstra or with whatever
other supplier he then dealt.  However
it is clear that in a significant number of cases there was misrepresentation
about the effect
of the form.  There were many complaints about
misunderstanding produced in that way; many complaints were made to AAPT and
many
to Telstra, and Telstra produced affidavits of a number of telephone
subscribers which proved plain cases of misrepresentation. 
AAPT does not
dispute that misrepresentation and misleading and deceptive conduct
occurred.
<P>

18  	The form which was used prior to July 1998 offered a choice in
question 3 in the following terms:
<P>

"3.	<i>I authorise preselection/non-code access to AAPT for services when
available.</i>
<P>

<i>OR</i>
<P>

<i>I would prefer to continue to dial 1414 before using AAPT's services and do
not consent to being preselected</i>     "
<P>

In the earlier form the potential customer was expressly offered an opportunity
to opt out of preselection by ticking the box, so
that the customer would have
access to AAPT Services by dialling the override code but not otherwise.  This
followed AAPT's perceived
interest in obtaining pre-selected customers, not
override customers.  The meaning of the form is reasonably clear to anyone who
gives attention to what it says, and the opportunity to elect against
pre-selection is clear and not difficult to take.
<P>

19  	In my view difficulties relating to the use of either form do
not arise from the forms themselves but from accompanying misrepresentations
by
dealers, which could readily deflect a customer from understanding them.
<P>

20  	At the time of the hearing AAPT was in the process of
introducing a third form in which the words "<i>Authority to change long
distance telephone company</i>" appear very prominently as the heading; this
would be even less susceptible of misunderstanding, but would remain
susceptible of
misunderstanding if a misrepresentation were made about it.  
<P>

21  	In my view it would be inappropriate to restrain AAPT from using
any of the application forms which it has used.  What requires
to be restrained
is misrepresentation and misleading and deceptive conduct, and the forms are
innocuous if properly used.  
<P>

22  	In Claim 2(b) restraint is sought against "accepting or
processing an application form signed by a person other than a person
who
states that he or she is the person in whose name the account is held with the
existing supplier of telephone services or authorised
representative of the
customer who is registered with such."  The forms used by AAPT contain a
shorter statement which has the effect
in substance of making just such a
statement:  "<i>I have the authority to make this change and confirm that these
details are correct</i>."  Claim 2(c) would restrain AAPT from requesting
Telstra to effect preselection (which must be carried out by technology in
Telstra's
control) without a regularly signed application form.  The claim is
that the form must be "signed by a person who is, or purports
to be, the person
in whose name the account is held with the existing supplier of telephone
service or signed by a person who is
or purports to be an authorised
representative of the customer ... and which of the customer who is registered
as such, and which
also records the name of the alleged authorised
representative and identifies the signatory as being an authorised
representative."
 
<P>

23  	The circumstances in which a carrier in the position of AAPT may
originate an authorisation for preselection to be changed
from Telstra (or from
some other carrier) are regulated by an Industry Protocol - Exhibit 9.  I do
not favour adding a further layer
of regulation.  There have in fact been
misrepresentations, by sales representatives at residences or in shopping
centres, about
the need for authorisation of the telephone subscriber to sign
an application form; these are dealt with by Order 1(e).  There are
obvious
needs for AAPT to ensure that it actually has the authority of the telephone
subscriber before originating a request to change
preselection; an unauthorised
change is likely to produce dissatisfaction and complaints, and preselections
involve expense as AAPT
must pay Telstra a fee for each change.  A subscriber
whose preselection has been changed without the subscriber's actual authority
incurs no contractual liability to AAPT for telephone calls made through the
unauthorised preselection.  There is, it seems to me,
nothing but trouble for
AAPT if it acts on an unauthorised application, and trouble of that kind has
been encountered many times.
 
<P>

24  	There are practical difficulties for a mandatory order requiring
AAPT to take steps to establish that no deception has been
practised on it.  In
his evidence Mr Matic narrated some practical difficulties which are
encountered, one being that information
published in the White Pages does not
necessarily identify the subscriber, who may be a different person to the
person whose name
is published, while no names are published for many numbers
and there are delays and inefficiencies caused by changes and alterations;
AAPT
does not have access to the whole body of information about the names of
subscribers held by Telstra.  On behalf of Telstra
it was contended that AAPT
should not accept an application without seeing the subscriber's last telephone
account; this requirement
would be impractical and would impede most sales in
shopping centres and many door-to-door, and the contention was on the verge of
the mischievous.  
<P>

25  	AAPT has a business routine of making verification calls before
originating a request to change the preselection; this method
is not perfect as
the dealer is required to make a verification call, but may fail to do so or
may not do it well; and AAPT does
not continue if three attempts fail.  The
possibility of unauthorised preselection is also diminished by AAPT's routine
of communicating
to the subscriber or apparent subscriber by posting out a
"Welcome Kit". AAPT also sent customers a letter confirming preselection,
when
that happened, and sent out other marketing material. Telstra also communicated
with subscribers who were preselected away from
it.
<P>

26  	In almost all cases it will have been brought home to a customer
whose telephone service was preselected to smartChat that
preselection has
taken place. For most of the period from October 1997 to March 1999 AAPT also
had a procedure referred to as  "the
Safety Net" in which preselection was not
effected until a customer had first made a call dialling override.  This Safety
Net routine
was not followed between November 1998 and February 1999 but was
reinstated in February 1999.  AAPT posted the "Welcome Kit" to all
customers,
and sent bills for telephone services, repeated at intervals which varied with
intensity of use. On behalf of Telstra
it was submitted <i>that "AAPT has done
little, if anything to remedy the effect of its past conduct or to ensure that
it does not occur again</i>."  In my view the steps which AAPT has taken as a
matter of routine, while not directed specifically to remedying the effects of
misrepresentation, have been reasonably complete in pointing out to customers
that a change in preselection has taken place; the
message of receiving an
account for whatever long distance calls have been made is unmistakable. 
<P>

27  	The possibility that a subscriber may be unwillingly preselected
under an unauthorised application form and then fail to object
when informed of
the change does not appear to me to be large. There is a residue of room for
customer inertia to operate, but it
would be a strange and unusual customer who
would receive communications and bills from a telephone company he did not want
to deal
with, yet do nothing about it. 
<P>

28  	AAPT's methods, which include obtaining a representation of
authority from the person signing the form, appear to me to be
reasonably
sufficient in a business context, although they leave open some possibility
that an unauthorised preselection may occur.
 As a matter of strong probability
the number of preselected AAPT customers who are well satisfied with their
preselection outweighs
by a very large preponderance the number who have been
preselected as a result of deception but continue to be AAPT customers.
<P>

29  	For the customer who did not want a change in preselection the
remedy of contacting either AAPT or Telstra by telephone to
reverse the
situation is too obvious to require explanation. Telstra set up what it called
a Slamming Hot Line to facilitate contacts
from customers dissatisfied with
other carriers.  Some customers did contact Telstra by this means. 
<P>

30  	It is my judgment that intervention by the court as claimed in
Claim 2 is not appropriate.
<P>

31  	Claim 3 claimed an order prescribing in detail matters which
must appear on the application forms so as to give greater prominence
to the
fact that the form operates to change the long distance telephone company with
whom the subscriber is to deal.  This claim
was not pressed in final
submissions.
<P>

	
<P>

32  	Claim 4 is a claim for an order requiring AAPT to confirm by
telephone with the customer some matters relating to the application.
 In fact
it has been AAPT's business practice to make three attempts to verify the
customer's position by telephone inquiry.  This
has operated cumulatively over
other confirmation mechanisms; the dealer is required to make a confirmatory
call before submitting
the application form and is not entitled to commission
otherwise, and written communications should alert the subscriber to the fact
that there has been a change.  The orders sought would go somewhat further in
that it would prescribe in detail four questions which
must be put, require a
written record to be kept and forbid changing the preselection unless there
were affirmative answers.  The
four questions are: 
<P>

(1).	When you signed the Authority to Change Long Distance Telephone company,
was the telephone service in your name?
<P>

(2)	Did you understand when you signed the Application Form that you were
switching your long distance telephone company to AAPT?
<P>

(3)	Were you left a copy of the Application Form you signed together with a
cooling-off form?
<P>

(4)	Did you understand when you signed that you do not have to switch to AAPT
for particular long distance calls?
<P>

33  	AAPT opposed the making of such an order but put forward an
alternative form for question (4) if the court thought fit to require
it.
<P>

34  	An interlocutory order of the same nature as in claim 4 was made
by the Court (Rolfe J) on 19 March 1999 on an urgent interlocutory
application
and has effect until the delivery of this judgment.  In a general way, what
this order requires is something which it
is prudent for AAPT to do in its own
interest and AAPT had a generally similar business routine.  An altogether
different dimension
is introduced if the questions which must be asked are
prescribed by court order; the action which would follow is also to be
prescribed
in detail in a way which leaves no leeway for discretion or business
judgment, and compliance is enforceable by contempt procedures
or penalties.
Question 4 as proposed by Telstra is not well related to remedying any claim
which Telstra makes, and it appears to
me to go well beyond anything which AAPT
could be expected to ask in its own interest, and to go so far as to be
oppressive.  It
would require AAPT to make a point to the customer which
Telstra would wish to make.  I see no reason why the Court should expect
or
require AAPT to promote override business if it does not wish to.
<P>

35  	The interlocutory orders have now been in force for some months
and of themselves have probably had some remedial effect in
the discipline in
which they have imposed on AAPT and in the exposure to the questions and their
implications of persons whose applications
had not been processed when the
interlocutory order was made and to those whose applications have been received
since.
<P>

36  	In my judgment, any period during which it was appropriate for
the court actually to exercise control in detail over AAPT's
method of
conducting confirmatory telephone calls has now expired, and the interlocutory
order should not be continued.
<P>

	
<P>

37  	Claim 5 is for a mandatory order requiring AAPT to send out a
letter to each customer who AAPT's records indicate has changed
carrier from
Telstra to AAPT since 1 July 1997 as a result of AAPT's face to face marketing.
The letter took various forms as the
case progressed.  In the form handed to me
with final submissions AAPT was to state that the Court had ordered AAPT to
write the
letter, that complaints about misleading statements had been received
and to clarify the position AAPT was to say:
<P>

<i>"(1)	The AAPT Application for Service form is intended to authorise the
change of your preselected long distance telephone company
from Telstra to
AAPT;</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	A person cannot sign the AAPT Application for Service form unless the
telephone service is in their name or they are an authorised
representative of
that person;</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	AAPT's long distance rates are not necessarily cheaper than those of
Telstra.  In order to accurately compare AAPT's and Telstra's
prices, you will
need to consider how long a call is, when it is made, where it is made from and
where it is made to, as well as
any applicable discounts or special
offers;</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	AAPT is a competitor of Telstra in relation to the supply of long
distance telephone services.  AAPT is not affiliated with Telstra
nor is it a
part of Telstra</i>."
<P>

38  	The letter was to conclude by enclosing a change of carrier
form, apparently for a change to Telstra, and a reply paid envelope
addressed
to Telstra.
<P>

39  	The information which such a letter would furnish is information
which would become obvious to all but the irretrievably obtuse
subscriber
fairly early in the period after preselection as the subscriber received a
series of communications including telephone
accounts and claims for payments.
Although it is a human truth that some customers respond with inertia to events
in the telephone
services market, the business is conducted, as is notorious
from its advertising, on the basis that the customers, or the customers
who are
worth having, are aware of the balance of their interests and the significance
of prices, which change frequently, and prices
are a subject on which
participants in the industry address customers and potential customers
continuously and stridently.  There
may be some customers to whom the four
statements in the proposed letter would actually communicate something
previously unknown,
but they can be very few and of no particular commercial
significance.  
<P>

40  	The communication of new information to customers is unlikely to
be a real effect of sending out letters of this kind.  The
true and only
significant result which I expect would be achieved if this order is made is
that AAPT would be required to post out
to the customers it has gained over the
last two years a form appropriate for them to change their preselection to
Telstra accompanied
by a Reply Paid envelope addressed to Telstra.  This, in my
judgment is altogether excessive, and it would be oppressive to require
AAPT to
communicate with its customers in this way.  It is quite open to Telstra to
communicate with customers, past customers and
potential customers in any
proper terms; it in fact does communicate with persons who have been
preselected away from Telstra, and
it can distribute its own information and
forms.
<P>

41  	In deciding which orders I should make I have to hold a balance
so as to do justice and make an appropriate judicial response
to the enormities
and<i> </i> breaches of the law which have occurred, but not to intervene
inappropriately in the workings of competition among participants in
the
industry.  It is a concern of mine that in pressing for unusual remedies,
Telstra may have gone further than seeking to attain
justice and it may have
sought to impose burdens and disadvantages on AAPT which will unduly disturb
the competitive balance.  I
am concerned that the Court should not make an
order which will have that effect.
<P>

42  	In presenting Telstra's claim for mandatory orders requiring
remedial measures, Telstra's counsel sought findings which would
establish a
high degree of involvement and responsibility of AAPT's management in the
misrepresentations and conduct complained of.
 The contention that AAPT has not
done anything adequate to remedy the effect of the past conduct was part of
this position.  The
most effective remedy is that the customer should
understand what has happened; the consequential steps of deciding that the
outcome
is unsatisfactory and should be changed are steps for the customer and
they are steps which a customer who believed that his business
had been
obtained by deception would be very likely to take.  Sending out the "welcome
kit" appears to me to have been as effectual
remedial action as could well be
devised.  
<P>

43  	Another aspect of the position taken by Telstra's counsel was
the contention that AAPT's marketing campaign was inherently
at risk of
misleading and deceiving customers.  In support of this contention Telstra's
counsel pointed to the forms of initial application
for service and their "Opt
Out" format, to the form in Exhibit A which is appropriate simply to effect a
change of long distance
carrier whenever preselection is available, and the
confusion which it was submitted arose from simultaneously marketing both
override
access and preselection.  In my view all these steps were reasonable
measures to take in addressing the market and it was not correct
to contend
that the campaign was inherently at risk.  The risk is created by dishonest
behaviour of sales agents, and there is no
reason to find that AAPT inspired or
brought about that behaviour.  
<P>

44  	In this connection it was contended that AAPT's controls over
its dealers and their agents were completely ineffective, and
that the signs in
the evidence of endeavours to control their behaviour showed an absence of any
true or effective effort.  In my
view this is quite incorrect as a matter of
fact; there is no basis for finding that the offending conduct was tolerated,
treated
as acceptable, or regarded with complacency in view of perceived
benefits derived from it.  Any such benefits would be illusory as
no trader
could have any real interest in obtaining an alienated customer base.  The
evidence shows activity in attempting to exercise
control; in retrospect
various respects in which the activity could have been more intense can be
suggested, but I see no basis for
a finding that it was not sincerely
undertaken.  
<P>

45  	Complaints about dealers were dealt with thoroughly.  Some
dealers were terminated.  One was taken over by a reliable dealer.
Mr Paul
Glendenning was employed as Manager, National Dealers until his employment was
terminated in January 1999.  He was responsible
for AAPT's relations with
dealers; he showed activity and vigour but he too was terminated for not being
sufficiently effective.
 Telstra's counsel was able to point to dealers who
could well have been but were not terminated, but this hindsight is not an
indication
that the activity and control which did lead to the termination of
some dealers were not sincerely intended, or were not effective.
 
<P>

46  	The contention that the misleading and deceptive conduct was
systemic throughout AAPT and was not confined to dealers was not
made out;
indeed in my view there is no real basis for that contention.  Mr John Anthony
Matic was the officer of AAPT with responsibility
for the affairs with which
this litigation deals: at the time of the hearing his position was Group
Director, Commercial and Consumer
Division.  The manner in which
cross-examination of Mr  Matic was conducted constituted a vigorous attack on
his sincerity and personal
suitability for the conduct of AAPT's affairs, and
in my judgment this attack was entirely unsuccessful.
<P>

47  	The incidence of complaints is not well represented in AAPT's
records; it seems clear that making a full written record of
complaints
received has never been an objective of AAPT's management.  When telephone
verification procedures were carried out under
this Court's interlocutory
orders and were carefully recorded about 10%, a surprisingly high proportion of
the persons spoken to,
gave a negative answer to Question 4.  That is to say,
they did not understand that the override code option was available to them;
presumably only the preselection option was presented.  The figure of 10% was
presented in submissions as if it were a very far-reaching
demonstration of the
inadequacy of AAPT's business methods.  I do not see it in that way.  As AAPT's
commercial object was to gain
preselection customers it should be in no way
surprising that a high proportion of the customers who signed application forms
should
not have been aware of the override option.  The figure of 10% is not an
indication that that proportion of customers have overall
dissatisfaction with
their dealings with AAPT.
<P>

48  	The court-ordered questioning procedure showed that 37% of the
subscribers spoken to indicated that they did not wish to give
effect to the
preselection forms which they previously signed.  21% wanted to continue as
AAPT customers using the override code,
but did not want to continue with
preselection to AAPT.  16% did not want AAPT's service at all.  These
proportions are strikingly
high, but they are not proof that those proportions
or a high proportion were subjected to deception.  Mr Matic sought when
challenged
with the figure of 37% to make the best he could of the proportions
who wished to adhere to their arrangements; this was the point
of his greatest
difficulty.  The figure of 37% is not an indication of the proportion who
believed they had been deceived; it includes
all who after an interval said,
for whatever reason, that they did not wish to adhere to the arrangement to
change their preselected
long distance carrier.
<P>

49  	Telstra's counsel contended that the maximum number of people
potentially misled is nearly 200,000.  This submission was quite
incorrect and
very greatly overstated.  There is no way of coming to a clear view about the
number of customers which AAPT has obtained
through misrepresentation and
misleading and deceptive conduct, but I infer that it is a small proportion of
those obtained through
the dealer network.  The scale of the problem is that
some thousands of customers have probably been obtained by misleading and
deceptive
conduct, they all have had the opportunity to realise that this is so
and to complain; many have complained and the means of taking
their business
away from AAPT if they are truly dissatisfied are already to hand for them.
This rather indeterminate conspectus of
the numbers involved presents a very
different view to counsel's reference to a maximum of 200,000 potentially
misled customers.
<P>

50  	I accept AAPT's evidence that AAPT on 5 May 1999 had 70,027
smartChat customers who came through the dealer network.  50,075
of these had
completed application forms for preselection, and another 19,952 had completed
application forms to obtain override
dialling services and had later moved to
preselection on their own initiative.  In addition to those 70,027 customers a
further 17,237
signed up for preselection but were never preselected because
they did not ever in fact dial the override code.  (The customers who
signed up
for preselection but did not ever dial the code are excluded under the Safety
Net procedure; in the months when the Safety
Net procedure was not in effect
such customers were preselected.)
<P>

51  	As well as action directly related to changing their long
distance telephone company back to the supplier they wish for, customers
have
access to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.  Further, Telstra took and
advertised initiatives to combat misleading
conduct, so that customers who are
concerned to complain had ready access to Telstra by telephoning its "Slamming
Hotline."  
<P>

52  	The likelihood is that customers who have been preselected to
AAPT as a result of misrepresentation are aware of their opportunity
to return
to their previous carrier.  There can be very few who are still labouring under
the effects of misrepresentation.  The
barriers to corrective action are slight
and any dissatisfied subscriber who was not completely inert would soon pass
them.  A subscriber
must take some initiative to do so but the means to do so
are as close as the telephone.  The customer affidavits show instances
of
customers adverting to difficulties fairly readily and without much delay.  It
would usually be clear to the customer within a
month or so at the most if the
customer had been deceived. 
<P>

53  	This is a case where strong measures are clearly required to
prevent misrepresentation and misleading and deceptive conduct.
 The injunction
which I propose to make constitutes appropriately strong measures and to go
further would be an excessive judicial
response.
<P>

54  	In Claims 5 and 5(a) in the Summons Telstra claims declarations
which will establish that AAPT has, by engaging in conduct
alleged in the
Points of Claim, engaged in conduct that is misleading or deceptive in
contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.42</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">43</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> NSW.  These declarations would simply state the legal
effect of the facts on which the injunction is based.  
<P>

55  	The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to make binding declarations
of right.  <b>In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 564</a>
at 581 it was said, in the leading judgment, "It is now accepted that superior
courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief."
(Mason CJ, Dawson,
Toohey and Gaudron JJ).  This power is declared by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act 1970</a> and is available for exercise in the present proceedings where the
court is invested with Federal jurisdiction by subs.86(1) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a>.  The power is a discretionary power and is subject to
limits stated in <b>Ainsworth</b> at 582 which do not prevent the Court from
making a declaration in this case; the declaration sought is not abstract or
hypothetical,
and Telstra has a real interest in the subject matter.  The
making of the declarations claimed is, in my opinion, within power and
is
discretionary.  Cf <b>RAIA Insurance Brokers Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co.
Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/92.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 92</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2041%20FCR%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 41 FCR 164</a> at 177-178 (Beaumont and Spender JJ).  
<P>

56  	Declaratory orders are not made as of course when remedies are
granted under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, and in my opinion they should not be.
Telstra's counsel referred me to observations in <b>Tobacco Institute of
Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations</b> (No.2)
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2041%20FCR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 41 FCR 289</a> at 100 (Shepherd J) and 107 (Hill J).  The circumstances of
that case were unusual; the applicant as respondent on appeal applied
for and
was granted a declaratory order although it did not recover any other
substantial relief, having regard to the disposition
of the appeal; the
declaratory order established that the Tobacco Institute's advertising was
misleading and deceptive, this was
the central issue in the case and had been
opposed without success by the Tobacco Institute, and Shepherd J's decision to
make a
declaratory order was based on the view that the matter involved public
interest in the form of the health and well-being of the
nation.  It appears to
me that the majority strongly disapproved of the Tobacco Institute's conduct
and that Australian Federation
of Consumer Organisations' success on the issue
fought would not otherwise have been reflected in the court's orders.
<P>

57  	In the present case Telstra is entitled to remedies which
vindicate its rights, that is, an injunction and orders which will
establish
its entitlement to damages and provide for their assessment.  The factual basis
for the assessment of damages is established
by the terms of Telstra's claim
and AAPT's admissions.  A declaratory order is a form of relief, and should not
be added to other
relief granted to a party unless it has some real effect as
relief.  A declaratory order is not made only to give other remedies
an air of
completeness or of symmetry.  
<P>

58  	I must make my own approach to the exercise of the discretion
involved and my decision is based on the view that there is not
sufficient
utility in a declaratory order to justify making it; Telstra has otherwise
obtained appropriate remedies.
<P>

59  	Counsel should bring in Short Minutes which will give effect to
this decision by making an injunction according to Claim 1
as modified,
dissolving the interlocutory orders, dismissing Telstra's other claims for
injunctions, and referring the assessment
of damages to an agreed arbitrator
or, in default of agreement, to an arbitrator whom I will appoint.  I have not
yet considered
questions of costs.
