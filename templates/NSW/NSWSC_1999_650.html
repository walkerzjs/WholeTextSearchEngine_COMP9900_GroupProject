<P>

<b>JUDGMENT NO. 27</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1   	This judgment provides my reasons for allowing the tender
by the Crown of covertly recorded conversations between the accused
Mr Sleiman
and Miss Cassar at their flat at 8/42 Newman Street, Merrylands, and between
them and other persons on the telephone from
the flat.
<P>

2   	The tape recordings of the conversations became Exhibit AO
and a transcript of the conversations became Exhibit AP.  The conversations
all
occurred in December 1997.
<P>

<b>Voice identification</b>
<P>

3   	In my judgment No 11, delivered on 14 April 1999, I gave my
reasons for a ruling made on 9 April 1999 that evidence to identify
the voices
of the accused in these conversations was admissible.  Miss Cassar had conceded
that the voice purporting to be hers was
hers.  Mr Sleiman had not made a
similar concession in relation to his voice or that of Miss Cassar.  Later in
the trial, Miss Cassar
gave evidence, including evidence about these
conversations.  Her evidence put the identity of the two accused as the persons
recorded
on the tapes beyond any question of doubt.
<P>

<b>Rulings</b>
<P>

4   	Subsequently, I gave rulings on objections relating to the
content of the conversations.  Later still, there were reconsiderations,
concessions and further rulings.  It is unnecessary to trace the course of this
process.  I will present here my reasons for allowing
those parts of the
recorded conversations which were ultimately admitted into evidence over the
objection of the accused.
<P>

<b>Grounds of objection</b>
<P>

5   	The grounds of objection advanced on behalf of Miss Cassar
were that admissions made by her were obtained in a way which was
unfair and an
infringement of her right to silence; secondly, relevance; and, thirdly, unfair
prejudice <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 135</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>).
<P>

6   	The grounds of objection advanced on behalf of Mr Sleiman
were poor quality of the recordings; relevance; and unfair prejudice
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss
135</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>).
<P>

<b>Admissions unfairly obtained and infringement of right of silence.</b>
<P>

7   	Evidence tendered on the voir dire established that
relevant parts of the conversations were responsive to information concerning
the status of the police investigation supplied by Miss Cassar's mother and
sister, who were themselves responding to information
provided to them by the
police.  Detective Sergeant Henderson said, in his evidence on the voir dire,
that his motivation in supplying
information to Miss Cassar's family was that
he believed Miss Cassar was at risk of violence from Mr Sleiman, and he was
concerned
to provide her with the opportunity of police protection, using her
family as intermediaries.  Be that as it may, I was satisfied
that it was at
least a concurrent motivation for the police providing information to Miss
Cassar's family that this was likely to
actuate conversation between the
accused at the flat and between them and others on the telephone which might
contain admissions
by them.
<P>

8   	As to the stage reached in the police investigation as at
December 1997, Detective Sergeant McNab, who was in charge of the
investigation, said, in his evidence on the voir dire, that he believed there
was sufficient evidence to lay charges, but that he
was awaiting advice from
police legal officers in that regard when Mr Stacey made his further statement
on 20 December 1997, saying,
in effect, that he saw Mr Sleiman stab the
deceased.  At the time of the recorded conversations in question, all of which
pre-dated
20 December 1997, the police had not yet decided to charge the
accused.  That was clear to my mind.  Certainly, it was not affirmatively
established that the police had decided to charge the accused prior to the
relevant conversations or any of them.
<P>

9   	The leading case is the decision of the High Court in
<i>Swaffield</i> <i>and Pavic</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%20151%20ALR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98) 151 ALR 98.</a>  In Swaffield's case,
the accused was charged with crimes including arson.  No evidence was offered
at his committal hearing and
he was discharged.  Subsequently, an undercover
police officer, in the course of investigating other matters, engaged Swaffield
in
conversation concerning the arson matter and obtained admissions from him in
that regard.  At his trial, objection was taken to evidence
of the admissions.
The trial judge declined to exclude the evidence.  Swaffield was convicted.
The Court of Appeal (Queensland) upheld
an appeal and quashed the conviction.
The High Court dismissed an appeal from that decision.  
<P>

10   	In Pavic's case, the accused was given the customary
warning at the commencement of an interview with the police.  He declined
to
answer questions put to him and was allowed to leave.  Subsequently, another
person, Clancy, agreed to being fitted with a microphone
to record a
conversation with Pavic.  Pavic made a number of inculpatory statements.  The
trial judge declined to disallow the evidence.
 Pavic was convicted.  The Court
of Appeal (Victoria) dismissed an appeal.  The High Court upheld that
result.
<P>

11   	The decision in <i>Swaffield</i> was unanimous.  Kirby J
dissented in <i>Pavic</i>.
<P>

12   	The judgment by Brennan CJ and the joint judgment by
Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ are along very similar lines.  It was said
that
there are four grounds on which confessional evidence may be excluded in the
exercise of the court's discretion.  First, such
evidence may be excluded on
the ground that the confession was not voluntary.  Such evidence is excluded
because of its unreliability
or dubious reliability. 
<P>

13   	Secondly, there is the unfairness discretion.  The
following passage is from the judgment of Brennan CJ in <i>Duke</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20180%20CLR%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 180
CLR 508</a>, 513.
<P>

"If, by reason of the manner of the investigation, it is unfair to admit
evidence of the confession, whether because the reliability
of the confession
has been made suspect <i>or for any other reason</i>, that evidence should be
excluded.  Trickery, misrepresentation, omission to inquire into material facts
lest they be exculpatory,
cross-examination going beyond the clarification of
information voluntarily given, or detaining a suspect or keeping him in
isolation
without lawful justification - to name but some improprieties - may
justify rejection of evidence of a confession if the impropriety
had some
material effect on the confessionalist, albeit the confession is reliable and
was apparently made in the exercise of a free
choice to speak or to be silent."
<i>(Emphasis added.)</i>
<P>

The nature of the unfairness which justifies the exclusion of a confession that
is voluntary and apparently reliable should be identified:
per Brennan CJ in
<i>Swaffield</i> at 107.
<P>

14   	Thirdly, there is the public policy or <i>Bunning v
Cross</i> discretion.  There is an overlap with the unfairness discretion.
Brennan CJ said in <i>Swaffield </i>at 108:
<P>

"Thus the chief object of the public policy discretion is the constraining of
law enforcement authorities so as to prevent their
engaging in illegal or
improper conduct, although the securing of fairness to an accused is a relevant
factor in the exercise of
the discretion."
<P>

15   	Fourthly, there is the unduly prejudicial ground.  This
involves the weighing of unfair prejudice against probative value.

<P>

16   	Reference was made in the joint judgment of Toohey,
Gaudron and Gummow JJ to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 90</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">138</a>(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>
</i>(NSW).  In their opinion, the statutory provisions were to be construed as
co-extensive with the common law.  Accordingly, what is
said in <i>Swaffield
and Pavic</i> applies in this state notwithstanding that the appeals in that
case were from Queensland and Victoria where there is no comparable
legislation.
<P>

17   	There was a difference of emphasis in the way in which the
results were expressed in <i>Swaffield</i> <i>and Pavic</i>.  In relation to
Swaffield's case, Brennan CJ noted that the police officer, relevantly a person
in authority, deliberately misrepresented
himself not to be a police officer in
order to secure answers to questions which Swaffield had earlier told the
police he would not
answer.  There was a public interest in ensuring that the
police did not adopt tactics that were designed simply to avoid the limitations
on the inquisitorial functions.   In Swaffield's case<i> </i>such a limitation
arose from rule 2 of the Judges' Rules (Where a police officer has decided to
charge a person, he should first caution
such person before asking questions.).
Brennan CJ thought that the decision in Swaffield's case could have gone either
way and that
the High Court should not interfere in a question touching the
standard and methods of police investigation unless the decision was
erroneous
in principle or otherwise manifestly wrong. 
<P>

18   	On the other hand, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ thought
that the admissions were elicited by the undercover police officer
in clear
breach of Swaffield's right to chose whether or not to speak.  They said the
Court of Appeal was right in its conclusion.
 That was a more emphatic
statement but with the same result.
<P>

19   	In relation to<i> </i>Pavic's case, Brennan CJ said (at
114):
<P>

"[35]  In Pavic's case, the confessional statements were made to Clancy whom
Pavic knew as a friend.  Clancy was not a police officer
or other person in
authority over Pavic.  There was no impropriety in the police obtaining
Clancy's consent to the recording by Clancy
of his intended conversation with
Pavic.  A serious crime had been committed and the means adopted for its
solution and for the securing
of evidence against the prime suspect were quite
legitimate.  The investigation of crime is not a game governed by a sportsman's
code of fair play <i>Bunning v</i> <i>Cross </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20141%20CLR%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 141 CLR 54</a> at 75;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=19%20ALR%20651" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">19 ALR
651</a> per Stephen and Aickin JJ.  Fairness to those suspected of crime is not the
giving of a sporting opportunity to escape the consequences
of any legitimate
and proper investigation or the giving of a sufficient opportunity `to invent
plausible falsehoods' <i>R v Lee</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1950/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2082%20CLR%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 82 CLR 133</a> at 152.
<P>

[36]  The fact that Clancy was regarded as trustworthy by Pavic is an indicator
of the reliability of the admissions made to Clancy.
 There was no public
interest to be served by rejecting those admissions.  The Court of Appeal in
Victoria was therefore right to
dismiss Pavic's application for leave to
appeal."
<P>

20   	On the other hand, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ said
that, in all the circumstances, there was no sufficient reason to interfere
with the trial judge's refusal to exclude the evidence of the conversation in
Pavic's case. That was a less emphatic statement but
with the same result.
<P>

21   	The present case is a fortiori <i>Pavic</i> for the
following reasons.  The "accusatory stage" had not been reached in the present
case.  The police had not made up their mind
to charge the accused.  (I should
mention that Mason CJ was of the opinion in<i> Van Der Meer</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2035%20A%20Crim%20R%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 35 A
Crim R 232</a> that a caution was required if the police believed they had
sufficient evidence to charge the accused, as distinct from having made
up
their mind to do so (at 239-240).  However, that was not a view shared by the
other members of the court.  It is a view shared
by Kirby J in <i>Swaffield and
Pavic </i>at [142], but, again, there is no support to be found for that
approach in the judgments of other members of the court.)  Neither
of the
accused had refused to answer questions by the police in relation to the death
of Mr Burton.  So far as Miss Cassar is concerned,
the only relevant
conversation was the one to which I have referred, with Detective Sergeant
Henderson, in which Miss Cassar did
not decline to answer questions.  On the
contrary, she expressed a willingness to speak to the police about what she
could or could
not say.  She telephoned the police to do so.  It was just that,
as she would have it, that she knew nothing about the matter.  That,
according
to her, was all she could say to the police and she said it.  Detective
Sergeant Henderson told her there was no point
in coming in for an interview in
those circumstances, nor was there.  That was not an election by Miss Cassar to
decline to answer
questions by the police about the Burton stabbing.    
<P>

22   	The asserted unfairness identified by counsel for Miss
Cassar was that Miss Cassar had been led into making inculpatory statements
to
her mother and her sister by the police, who had provided information to her
family with a view to procuring such admissions.
<P>

23   	Factually, I accepted that as being correct.  However, the
police action involved no impropriety.  No trickery or misrepresentation
was
demonstrated.  Even if it had been, that would not necessarily have carried the
day.  It did not in relation to Pavic's case,
in <i>Swaffield</i> <i>and</i>
<i>Pavic</i>, [35] above 
<P>

24   	The leniency which is to be extended to the police in the
application of the unfairness principle is demonstrated by that<i> </i>case.
It is also demonstrated by <i>O'Neill </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QCA/1995/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] QCA 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2081%20A%20Crim%20R%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 81 A Crim R 458</a>, where Dowsett
J said, concerning a civilian (one Lally) who was used as a police agent in
such a way (at 553):
<P>

"It cannot be said that because Lally was acting covertly on behalf of the
police, there was inequality in the relationship between
her and the appellant
which might suggest to the appellant that she was under an obligation to speak.
No question of involuntariness
or unfairness arose from the fact that the
appellant was not warned.  The police are not obliged to be absolutely frank in
investigating
crime.  Indeed, the law providing for the use of listening
devices is statutory authority to the contrary.  Although we might all
prefer
that friendship not be exploited for ulterior purposes, the public interest in
detecting and punishing crime outweighs social
nicety."
<P>

25   	The unfairness ground was not made out in the present
case.
<P>

26   	I will now give my reasons for refusing to disallow the
evidence of the recorded conversations, tape by tape, having regard
to other
objections which were raised .
<P>

<b>Tape No. 1, 4 December 1997, 12.43, Listening Device</b>
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

27   	This conversation contained the statement by Mr Sleiman
"The night, the night I stabbed that bastard to death" and the statement
"I
stabbed him".
<P>

28   	It was submitted by counsel for Mr Sleiman that the
accused was clearly under the influence of drugs, that the passage was
indistinct, and that it should be excluded in the exercise of my discretion.
Whether Mr Sleiman was under the influence of drugs
and to an extent which made
the passage unreliable was a jury question.
<P>

29   	As to clarity, the recordings of the telephone
conversations were very clear.  The recordings of conversations in the flat,
such as this one, were affected by background traffic noise.  Passages such as
this one required repeated listening to identify some
of the words with
confidence.  To my ear, that was achievable in this instance.  The jury also
had the benefit of the evidence of
Acting Detective Sergeant McNab, who said
that he played over these tapes repeatedly and wrote up the transcripts.  He
said that
he satisfied himself that the transcripts were accurate.  Where he
could not make out the words, he wrote "ind" for indecipherable.
 Acting
Detective Sergeant McNab was not challenged as to the accuracy of any part of
the transcripts which he wrote up.
<P>

30   	I make the same observations as to clarity in relation to
each of the conversations.
<P>

31   	The relevance of this conversation is apparent.  I will
not mention this point in relation to each conversation where relevance
is
obvious.
<P>

32   	There was no unfair prejudice to trigger ss 135-137.  I
will not mention this point in relation to each conversation where
no basis for
the argument is apparent.
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

33   	This conversation was not admitted against her.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 2.  8 December 1997.  1336.  Listening Device.</b>
<P>

34   	This tape was included at the request of counsel for Miss
Cassar.  Counsel for Mr Sleiman did not object.
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

35   	This conversation included a statement by Miss Cassar that
she had learned there was going to be a Coroner's Inquest on the
following
Friday.  She said she was going to ring the police about the case and that she
intended to do so on the mobile phone. 
Mr Sleiman's response was that she
could not do that because the mobile phone was dead and that she should not
ring on the home phone.
 
<P>

36   	That last statement by Mr Sleiman was capable of being
construed by a jury as an admission by Mr Sleiman that he had something
to hide
in relation to the Burton stabbing, on the basis that the only plausible
explanation for Mr Sleiman saying not to ring on
the home phone was that he
thought the home phone was, or might be bugged and that he did not want
anything said by Miss Cassar about
the Burton matter to be recorded by the
police.
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

37   	This conversation was not relied upon by the Crown as
evidence against Miss Cassar.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 3.  12 December 1997.  1534.  Telephone Intercept.</b>
<P>

38   	This was a telephone conversation between Miss Cassar and
her sister Kelly Cassar.  As such, it was not evidence against Mr
Sleiman.  
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

39   	This conversation was not relied on by the Crown as
containing any specific admission by Miss Cassar, express or implied.
 It was
relevant to show the relationship between Miss Cassar and her sister, to
provide the context of later conversations and as
"benchmark" evidence
concerning Miss Cassar's attitude in relation to the Mitsubishi Colt, to be
contrasted with her attitude later
when informed that the car had been
found.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 4.  13 December 1997.  0243.  Listening Device</b>
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman and Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

40   	Statements are made in this conversation both by Mr
Sleiman and Miss Cassar to the effect that they will be convicted when
charged
and be sent to prison.  It was open to the jury to infer an implied admission
of guilt from these statements.
<P>

41   	Counsel for Miss Cassar submitted that there were elements
of both jest and bravado in Miss Cassar's statements about being
convicted and
imprisoned.  It was a question for the jury as to whether these statements were
a reliable reflection of her true state
of mind.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 5.  17 December 1997.  1346.  Telephone Intercept.</b>
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

42   	This is a telephone conversation between Miss Cassar and
her mother, Sandra Cassar, and then with her sister, Kelly Cassar.
 As such,
the conversation was not admissible against Mr Sleiman.
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

43   	In this conversation, Miss Cassar was informed that the
police had found the car and had obtained sufficient statements from
people for
court.  Miss Cassar was also told that the police were having a meeting and
that charges would then be laid.
<P>

44   	Miss Cassar expressed concern as to whether the police had
obtained forensic evidence from the car such as prints.  She was
told that what
the police found was "virtually enough to clinch the deal".  It was open to the
jury to find that Miss Cassar's response
was one of despondency and to see it
as significant that her response was not one of denial of involvement.  Her
response included
statements that the police had to prove it, which the jury
was entitled to treat as an admission.
<P>

45   	Counsel for Miss Cassar argued that Miss Cassar's response
was consistent with being reconciled to what appeared to be the
police case as
distinct from truly being guilty of any offence.  That was a matter for
evaluation by the jury.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 6.  17 December 1997.  1406.  Listening Device.</b>
<P>

46   	This conversation between Mr Sleiman and Miss Cassar
occurred immediately after the telephone conversation between Miss Cassar
and
her mother and sister (Tape No. 5).  It was relied on by the Crown as evidence
against both of the accused.
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

47   	In this conversation, Miss Cassar told Mr Sleiman that the
police had found the car with fingerprints all over it and had
eighteen people
in witness protection who would say that Mr Sleiman had done it and that she
knew about it.  She went on to say "You
fucked it.  You fucked our lives, you
know that.  You're looking at a minimum of fifteen."  Mr Sleiman's response was
that he was
going for a walk.
<P>

48   	The jury was entitled to treat Mr Sleiman's silence in the
face of these assertions as an admission that he was responsible
for Mr
Burton's death and guilty of his murder.
<P>

49   	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Sleiman that what fell
from Miss Cassar was a rambling tirade which did not warrant a response.
 That
was a matter for the jury.
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

50   	This was one of the conversations in which Miss Cassar
revealed belief that she would be convicted and would be going to prison
with
(arguably the implication of a belief in her own guilt.)
<P>

<b>Tape No. 7.  17 December 1997.  1436.  Telephone Intercept.</b>
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

51   	This was a telephone conversation between Miss Cassar and
Detective Sergeant Henderson.  As such, it was not evidence against
Mr Sleiman.

<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

52   	The conversation provided a context for subsequent
conversations, in that it contained statements to Miss Cassar by Detective
Sergeant Henderson that the police had information that she knew about the
homicide and knew what had happened.  
<P>

53   	Also, the conversation contained a statement by Miss
Cassar, "I didn't even know about it until the next morning."  In view
of the
evidence of Miss Cassar passing Mr Burton on the stairs as she left the hotel,
at a time when Mr Burton was returning to the
hotel injured, it was open to the
jury to find that she must have known at that time that Mr Burton had, at
least, been injured,
if not mortally so .  In these circumstances, the Crown
was entitled to rely on that part of the conversation as a lie implying
consciousness
of guilt.  In the event, the Crown did not, in final address,
rely on this passage as a lie by Miss Cassar implying consciousness
of guilt.
That, however, does not detract from the admissibility of the evidence at the
time when it was tendered.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 8.  17 December 1997.  1607.  Telephone Intercept.</b>
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

54   	This was a telephone conversation between Miss Cassar and
a friend, Brad.  As such, the conversation was not admissible against
Mr
Sleiman.
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

55   	This is one of the conversations in which Miss Cassar
acknowledged that she would be convicted and imprisoned, and which the
jury
could construe as an implied admission of guilt.
<P>

<b>Tape No. 9.  17 December 1997.  1652.  Listening Device.</b>
<P>

56   	This tape recording falls into two sections.  First, there
is a conversation, mostly in Arabic, between Mr Sleiman and Mr
Rizk concerning
the Mitsubishi Colt.  The recording picks up only Mr Sleiman's end of the
conversation.  However, it was envisaged,
as occurred, that Mr Rizk would
translate what Mr Sleiman said and would give, in English, his own end of the
conversation.  Secondly,
there was a conversation between Mr Sleiman and Miss
Cassar following Mr Sleiman's conversation with Mr Rizk.
<P>

<i>As against Mr Sleiman</i>
<P>

57   	In the English version of the conversation with Mr Rizk,
as recorded in a voir dire exhibit, Mr Sleiman was recorded as asking
Mr Rizk
what he had told the police, as taxing Mr Rizk with having told the police that
he had given the car to Mr Sleiman, and as
asking Mr Rizk to tell the police
that the car was stolen.  (Relevantly, the evidence came out at the trial as
the voir dire exhibit
suggested it would.)  It was open to the jury to construe
this conversation as an admission by Mr Sleiman that the car in use on
the
night of the Burton stabbing was Mr Sleiman's Mitsubishi Colt and that Mr
Sleiman had something to hide in relation to the Burton
stabbing connected with
his use of that car on the night.  The jury were entitled to treat the attempt
by Mr Sleiman to have Mr Rizk
falsify information to the police about the car
as evidence of a consciousness of guilt on Mr Sleiman's part.
<P>

58   	In the conversation between Mr Sleiman and Miss Cassar
which followed the conversation with Mr Rizk, Mr Sleiman said "I'll
go and take
the rap all right Leanne" and "I'll take the rap for you Leanne".  The jury was
entitled to construe this as an admission
by Mr Sleiman that he was responsible
for having exposed Miss Cassar to the charge which she faced and, by
implication, for Mr Burton's
death.
<P>

<i>As against Miss Cassar</i>
<P>

59   	The conversation with Mr Sleiman is another of the
conversations in which Miss Cassar spoke in terms of acceptance that she
would
be convicted and imprisoned, providing a basis for an inference by the jury
that she was conscious of her own guilt.
<P>

60   	In relation to the conversation with Mr Rizk, Miss Cassar
is recorded as being actively involved in that conversation.  She
is recorded
as urging Mr Sleiman to telephone Mr Rizk, telling Mr Sleiman to ask when the
police came to interview Mr Rizk, wanting
to know the outcome of Mr Sleiman's
conversation with Mr Rizk, and wanting to know if the police had requested Mr
Rizk to make a
statement.  She is then recorded as becoming upset that Mr
Sleiman did not appear to understand what she regarded as the significance
of
the police having found the car or, at least, about Mr Sleiman refusing to
acknowledge that significance.  It was open to the
jury to infer from this that
the Mitsubishi Colt was the vehicle used on the night to Miss Cassar's
knowledge.
