<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	The applicant in these proceedings is Paul Michael Vescio
who is the defendant in proceedings brought by Edward Geoffrey Fingret
and
Janet Shirley Fingret, in possession of a property over which Westpac Bank
holds a first mortgage and the plaintiffs hold a second
mortgage.
<P>

2   	Because of the applicant's defaults under the mortgage, a
writ of possession was issued on 13 July 1999 in favour of the plaintiffs
and
steps have been taken to arrange to have the property sold by auction.  The
auction is scheduled for 7 o'clock or thereabouts
tonight.
<P>

3   	Late in the afternoon today I was advised by telephone that
an application for injunction would be made to restrain the conduct
of the
auction and the applicant, with his father and solicitor, attended with the
relevant documentation at 5 past 5 this afternoon.
 The application was
supported by the affidavit of Damien Parks, management consultant, sworn 19
October 1999 and the applicant himself,
sworn the same date.
<P>

4   	Mr Parks relevantly deposed that the expected sale price of
the property is $650,000.
<P>

5   	During the course of proceedings I was told that the amount
owing to Westpac under the first mortgage is about $450,000 and,
as best as can
be discerned, the total amount now owing to the plaintiffs including arrears of
interest, the estimated legal costs
which may be subject to challenge and the
costs of the auction, are potentially in the vicinity of $103,000, making a
total of $553,000.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff deposed that efforts had been made in recent
times to obtain a proper estimate of the total amount owing to the
plaintiffs
through the plaintiff's solicitors, Kremnizer &amp; Co, and that the figures I
have just referred to were ultimately those
provided, although there is some
uncertainty about how they are made up and whether they are the current
figures.
<P>

7   	There are two matters in the plaintiff's affidavit that are
of significance.  The first is that he deposed that he and his
father on
Monday, 18 October, visited the plaintiffs and that Mrs Fingret said that she
was happy to receive the interest, and it
appears that agreement was reached to
stop the auction.  The defendant confirmed that conversation in oral evidence
before me which,
of course, given the nature of these proceedings, was not
subject to cross-examination.
<P>

8   	In his affidavit the defendant also said the solicitor
representing the plaintiffs said that he could not stop the  auction,
having
regard to the amount of fees owing to his firm.
<P>

9   	The second matter of significance is that the defendant
alleges that the property concerned is on two titles but has not been
advertised as such, which would be expected to draw a larger sale price.  The
defendant has given an undertaking as to damages in
the event that an
injunction is granted.
<P>

10   	It seems to me that the only real bases for the injunction
are the two matters to which I have referred, that is the asserted
agreement of
the plaintiffs to accept monies owing and cancel the auction, and the asserted
failure to market the property in such
a way as to secure the best price.
<P>

11   	Put before me in evidence also was a letter from a loan
organisation confirming that it is prepared to advance to the plaintiff
$600,000, subject to verification of the information stated on the application
form and a satisfactory valuation on the property.
 This amount would be
sufficient to make the necessary payments to the plaintiffs and also to
Westpac,  thus, in my opinion, securing
adequately the position of the
plaintiffs.
<P>

12   	Having regard to all of those matters I do propose to
grant the injunction sought.  I order that Ray Ross Pty Ltd, trading
as Ray
White Real Estate Manly, be joined as a party to the proceedings for the
purpose of the following orders, and I restrain the
plaintiffs and Ray Ross Pty
Ltd from proceeding to auction or sell or dispose of the property at 1/2 A and
2/2 A Kentwell Parade
North Manly composed in folio identifier 1/SP 55060 and
2/SP 55060 until further order.
<P>

13   	I direct that notice of that order be given in the first
instance by telephone to both first respondents. That will have to
be done by
6:45pm.  I order that notice be confirmed by facsimile machine as soon as
possible when the order has been taken out.
<P>

14   	I will make the matter returnable before me at 10 am on
Thursday morning, 21 October 1999.  I will add to those orders noting
the
defendant gives the appropriate undertaking for damages.
<P>

15   	I order also that the defendant serve in the usual manner
copies of the orders, the notice of motion, the affidavits and the
exhibit,
Exhibit A, on the plaintiffs and on the second respondent.
<P>
