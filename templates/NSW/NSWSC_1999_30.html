<P>

DECISION: 
<P>

Civil penalty approved
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	On 5 February 1999 I determined that a proposed penalty was appropriate in
the circumstances of this case.  I said I would give
my reasons at a later
time.
<P>

2	This matter is associated with the matter of <i>Comptroller-General of
Customs v Kingswood Distillery Pty Limited</i>.  I refer to my judgment in that
matter of 5 December 1997.  Matters of principle, policy and practice referred
to in that judgment
should be taken as incorporated in this judgment by
reference.
<P>

3	The present matter is part-heard before Sully J.  Pursuant to a mediated
settlement reached between the parties a deed of settlement
has been executed.
In the proceedings as constituted before Sully J the Controller-General sought
a civil penalty for breaches of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea190180/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea190180/" class="autolink_findacts">Excise Act 1901</a></i> in relation
to a substantial number of batches of spirit.
<P>

4	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea190180/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 61</a> of the act provides as follows:
<P>

	"All excisable goods are, until delivered for home consumption or for
exportation to a place outside Australia, whichever first
occurs, subject to
the control of Customs and must not be moved, altered or interfered with except
as authorised by this Act." 
<P>

5	The subject goods were allegedly delivered to certain premises where the
defendant was employed as a foreman and where the defendant
allegedly committed
breaches of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea190180/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> while the goods were stored there.  The deed of settlement
provides for the filing of an amended statement of claim limiting the
breaches
relied upon to a breach in relation to one only of the batches to which I have
referred.  The civil penalty for that breach,
agreed subject to approval by the
Court, was $5,000.
<P>

6	The maximum penalty for breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea190180/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> is $20,000.  It is a material
consideration that the defendant was not a director of the company on whose
premises the goods came
to be stored and was not involved in the management of
that company.  It is also a material consideration that the defendant, by
the
deed, has provided an undertaking not to be involved, directly or indirectly,
with the importation of liquor for a period of
five years.
<P>

7	Having regard to the matters of principle, policy and practice referred to in
my judgment in <i>Kingswood</i> and to the facts and circumstances of the
present case, it appeared to me that the proposed penalty was appropriate.
<P>
