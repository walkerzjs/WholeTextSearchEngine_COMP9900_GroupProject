<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	The final hearing in these four sets of proceedings, commenced on 15 March
1999.  During the previous week and during the first
days of the hearing, a
number of settlements took place with the consequence that a number of issues
pleaded fell away and became
unnecessary to be considered.  In at least one
instance, the settlement of one set of proceedings may have an impact on the
ultimate
entitlements of parties litigating in relation to the proceedings
which continued.  In the result, it will become necessary in outlining
the
claims made and issues which require to be determined, to deal from time to
time with claims now settled.
<P>

2	Before turning to examine the parties and the issues in each of the four sets
of proceedings, it is convenient to commence with
a general outline to set the
factual background explaining how the cases come to be pursued.  The following
detail includes, as appropriate,
findings of fact.
<P>

	<b>The Principal Companies</b>
<P>

3	The cases relate principally to the activities of two companies which, at
material times, engaged in debt factoring and money
lending from the same set
of premises in Beverley Hills.  The companies are COD Factors Australia Pty
Limited (`CODFA') and Cashflow
Finance Pty Limited (in liquidation)
(`Cashflow').
<P>

4	Mr Peter Wright was at all material times the managing director of CODFA, the
managing director of Cashflow and the managing director
of a further company,
COD Factors Pty Limited (`Factors').
<P>

5	Mr William Kull was at all material times a director of CODFA.  He has at all
material times been a director and shareholder of
Kylon Pty Limited (`Kylon'),
effectively controlling Kylon through his shareholding.  Kylon is in turn a 50%
shareholder of CODFA.
 The other 50% shareholding in CODFA is held by
Factors.
<P>

6	To complete the shareholding picture in overview terms, it is convenient to
note that Factors at all material times held a 49%
shareholding in Cashflow and
that Pyrafount No. 3 Pty Limited [`Pyrafount'] at all material times held a 51%
shareholding in Cashflow.
 Mr Anthony Bonvino effectively controlled Pyrafount
through his shareholding.  Mr Bonvino was at all material times a director of
Cashflow.
<P>

7	It is of assistance even before turning to the detailed facts, to set out a
flow chart of companies tendered by Cashflow and forming
an annexure to the
report of Mr AJ Cachia of Bartlett and Cachia, chartered accountants[Exhibit
P8].
<P>

<P>

8	The key to the symbols used in Mr Cachia's Report comprises the following
schedule:

<P>

<u>	</u><b>Inducement to Invest</b>
<P>

9	In early December 1990, Mr Kull responded to an advertisement in the Business
Opportunities magazine, reading `Investors wanted
to invest in factoring
business, capital required'.  Ultimately, Mr Kull through Kylon, became such an
investor in CODFA.
<P>

10	Some three and a half years later, in mid-1994, Mr Anthony Bonvino responded
to a similar advertisement, this time reading:
<P>

	<i>`Investment opportunity</i>
<P>

<i>	Real Estate Secured</i>
<P>

<i>	17 p.c. int. paid monthly</i>
<P>

<i>	Long established company requires funds for expanding client base.  All
funds are fully secured.  Minimum investment $100,000.  Full
accounting figures
available.  For details and appointment, ring the accountant . . .'</i>
<P>

11	Thereafter, Mr Bonvino through Pyrafount, came to invest funds in
Cashflow.
<P>

12	There are substantial similarities in the initial discussions which Mr Kull
had with Mr Wright in December 1990 and which Mr
Bonvino had with Mr Wright in
mid-1994.  The convenient course is to first set out Mr Kull's evidence and to
then set out Mr Bonvino's
evidence.  I accept the following accounts of the
events as reliable and accurate.
<P>

	<b>Evidence of Mr Kull</b>
<P>

<b>	Introduction to Mr Wright</b>
<P>

13	In Mr Kull's initial telephone conversation with Mr Wright, Mr Wright said
words to the following effect:
<P>

	<i>`I have an established debt factoring business.  My company is called COD
Factors Pty Limited and I have my office at Beverley Hills.
 The company has
more business than it can handle at present and so I am interested in getting
more funds to invest.</i>
<P>

<i>	The business of debt factoring involves clients bringing to us their unpaid
invoices against which we loan them a fixed percentage
amount.  We advance up
to 80% of invoices less our factoring fee which is usually 5% so the client
gets approximately 75% of the
invoice value.  Our clients either advise their
debtors to pay COD Factors directly or they redirect to COD Factors any payment
which
they receive on invoices that have been factored with us.</i>
<P>

<i>	Prior to factoring for clients we obtain security on the clients' assets
through either registering a first or second mortgage on
the clients' property
or through obtaining a charge on the client company or a charge over its book
debts.  If payment of an invoice
which has been factored is not received by COD
Factors within 90 days, the invoice is given back to clients who then have to
repurchase
the invoice or provide new investors to be factored at the same
amount.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Paragraph 4, Statement of Mr Kull dated 14 April 1998]
<P>

14	Later in December 1990, Mr Kull had a meeting with Mr Wright at the offices
of Factors, situate at Suite 3, 407-409 King Georges
Road, Beverley Hills,
where Mr Wright said to Mr Kull:  "I have been operating COD Factors for the
last four or five years and have
a credit provider's licence.  At present, I
need more funds to factor because of an increasing client demand.  Moneys
provided by
you would be on-lent to clients under our normal factoring
agreement.  We pay investors such as yourself a monthly interest rate
on such
moneys that are lent to clients'.
<P>

15	Mr Wright then introduced Mr Kull to Mr Edward Walters, who is a party to
several of the sets of proceedings now before the Court,
saying to Mr Kull
words to the effect:  `This is Ed Walters.  Ed is an accountant.  He takes care
of the accounting and financial
side of things.  He keeps track of the debts
which we have factored, makes sure payments have been received, prepares what
we call
`First Schedules' when moneys are to be advanced, etc.'
<P>

16	At about the same time, Mr Wright introduced Mr Kull to Mr Walters' wife,
Mrs Lynette Walters.  Mrs Walters had been a party
to the proceedings but in
respect of all actions concerning her, they have now been settled.
<P>

17	Between December 1990 and August 1991, Mr Wright and Mr Kull had numerous
telephone conversations and exchanged correspondence
in relation to Mr Kull's
possible investment in the debt factoring business opportunity presented by Mr
Wright and about the business
structure through which Mr Kull could make such
an investment.  During one such conversation, Mr Kull said to Mr Wright words
to
the following effect:'
<P>

	<i>`I want a new company formed in which I will have a 50% ownership.  My
involvement in that company is however to be limited.  Board
meetings should be
held monthly at which I will want to review all new clients prior to the new
company undertaking any factoring
for them.  At each board meeting I also wish
to be able to see financial information as to the trading of the previous
month.  The
moneys which I invest in that company are to be secured by a charge
on the company that is created.  Such moneys are to be treated
as a loan to the
company for which I will receive interest.'</i>
<P>

18	Subsequently, Mr Kull agreed in principle with Mr Wright, that capital
invested in the new company by Mr Wright or Mr Kull would
receive interest at a
rate of 7% above the Westpac Indicator Rate and that this would be paid monthly
on all such loan money.  Any
further earnings from the company were to be paid
as a year end dividend, based on previous financial years profit and loss.  No
directors' salaries were to be paid.  [The Joint Venture Agreement and the
amendments to this Agreement are referred to below.]
<P>

19	During the conversations which Mr Kull had with Mr Wright, Mr Wright said to
Mr Kull words to the following effect:  
<P>

	<i>`The new company will operate the same way as COD Factors.  I will provide
the management services for the new company and will have
overall control of
the operation of the new company.  I will also have sole responsibility to
market the company and obtain new clients.
 I will want to be paid a minimum
monthly retainer plus a bonus fee for my services.  The bonus fee is to be
calculated on all fees
received from clients over the previous month.  I am
also to be reimbursed for my mobile phone expenses and motor vehicle
expenses.</i>
<P>

<i>	Ed Walters and Lynette Walters will continue to provide accounting,
banking, administrative and secretarial services to the new company.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>CODFA is Formed</b>
<P>

20	Mr Kull's negotiations with Mr Wright, culminated in an agreement to form a
new company and in due course CODFA was, on 26 June
1991, registered with the
Australian Securities Commission.  Mr Kull was appointed secretary and director
of CODFA and Mr Peter Wright
was appointed director.
<P>

	<b>Banking Arrangements</b>
<P>

21	In early July 1991, Mr Wright and Mr Kull attended Barclay's Bank at its
Blacktown Branch where they opened an account for CODFA.
 On about 20 July
1991, Mr Wright and Mr Kull also signed a banking agreement in respect of the
receipt by Barclay's Bank of cheques
made out to payees other than CODFA, which
might be deposited into CODFA's account.
<P>

22	Barclay's Bank also required each client of CODFA to provide Barclay's Bank
with a letter on the client's letterhead which stated
that CODFA had power to
bank cheques into CODFA's account, even though the payee on that cheque was not
in the name of CODFA.  This
was a requirement that was to be adhered to in
relation to all of CODFA's clients.  To Mr Kull's knowledge, this occurred with
a
number of particular CODFA clients.
<P>

23	The signatories to Barclay's account were Mr Wright, Mr Walters and Mr Kull.
Two signatories were required for cheques.
<P>

24	Mr Kull's understanding was that Barclay's Bank had become St George Bank in
1995.
<P>

	<b>Joint Venture Agreement</b>
<P>

25	On or about 1 August 1991, a Joint Venture Agreement was entered into
between Mr Kull, Kylon, Mr Wright, Factors and CODFA. 
The agreement which is
appended as Appendix 1, sets out the roles of Mr Wright, Factors, Kylon and Mr
Kull, and sets out the basis
upon which CODFA was to operate.
<P>

26	Factors contracted with CODFA to provide managerial services which in turn
were to be provided by Mr Wright.
<P>

27	The agreement as to Walters and Associates, who were to be the accountants
for CODFA, is provided for in paragraph 18 of the
Joint Venture Agreement.
<P>

28	Following execution of the Joint Venture Agreement, CODFA began trading and
effect was given to the Joint Venture Agreement.
 In particular, Factors
provided the services of Peter Wright to CODFA to undertake the management of
CODFA.
<P>

29	For this, Factors rendered accounts to CODFA which were presented for
payment at monthly meetings of CODFA.  Mr Kull would sign
cheques for the
payment of Factors' invoices at the monthly meetings.
<P>

30	The Joint Venture Agreement was subsequently amended on 3 June 1992 and 30
June 1993.
<P>

31	CODFA gave a charge in favour of Kylon on 21 August 1991.  It was registered
on 19 September 1991.
<P>

32	Kylon commenced from 5 July 1991 to advance funds to CODFA.  When CODFA
obtained more clients, Kylon advanced more funds to CODFA.
<P>

	<b>Records of CODFA - Office Set-up - Factoring Procedure</b>
<P>

33	CODFA maintained from the outset of business, a computer system which
recorded all ledgers, payments received, debtors of clients
and other financial
records.  It also maintained documents as follows:
<P>

	.	First Schedules (a listing of invoices attached to factoring agreements)
<P>

.	Folders which contained correspondence and copies of legal documentation
between CODFA and it's clients.
<P>

.	Folders which contained monthly summaries for each client.
<P>

.	Historical First Schedules and hard copies of historical financial
records.
<P>

.	Cheque books, bank statements and hard copies of ledger accounts.
<P>

.	The Joint Venture Agreement between Kylon, Mr Wright, Factors, CODFA and Mr
Kull.
<P>

.	Bank deposit slip books.
<P>

34	Mr Kull gave evidence as to his  detailed observations as to the office
layout and personnel at the Beverley Hills office during
the period 1991 until
about August 1996.  Mrs Walters apparently had a position behind the front
desk.  There was an office boardroom.
 There was one partitioned space which
became the office of Mr Royce Burkett, who also was at one time a party to
these proceedings,
and who traded as `Royce Burkett and Associates'.  There was
Mr Walters' office and an office of Mr Wright.  The keys to the office
were
held by Mr Walters and Mr Wright.  A coded alarm system was also installed in
the office.
<P>

35	Mr Kull gave a detailed statement as to his observation of the procedure for
factoring with clients of CODFA.  This involved
Peter Wright contacting
prospective clients or vice versa in person and by telephone and discussing
with them the terms of factoring.
 Mr Wright requested from clients some
security for any money advanced to clients.  Such security included a first or
second mortgage
on property of the client or a charge on book debts.
<P>

36	Mr Wright discussed with Mr Kull either at monthly meetings or by telephone,
the prospective client and security offered by that
client for moneys advanced.
Mr Wright and Mr Kull discussed and determined whether to factor or not factor
with the particular client
before advancing funds.
<P>

37	A factoring deed would then be prepared by CODFA's solicitors and this
document, once finalised, would be executed by CODFA and
the client.  Any
documents for the security obtained from the client were also to be executed at
that time.
<P>

38	The factoring deed set out the obligations of both CODFA and the client and
contained a copy of a letter which was required to
be completed by the client
on the client's letterhead, advising CODFA's bank to accept payment into
CODFA's account of cheques made
out to the client.  The factoring deed also
contained blank First Schedules.
<P>

39	First Schedules were to be completed by the client and these set out the
invoices of the client which the client wanted to have
factored.  Invoices
which were to be factored were to be attached at the back of the First Schedule
and forwarded by mail or couriered
to CODFA.
<P>

40	From the total amount of invoices, Mr Walters would then subtract both a
debit retention amount which was usually 20% of the
total amount of invoices to
be factored, and CODFA's factoring fee.  This adjusted amount was then paid to
the client.
<P>

41	Most First Schedules to Mr Kull's recollection, were for monthly periods
although some were weekly.
<P>

42	CODFA would normally require that all invoices that were factored be paid
within sixty days.  If all moneys were not received
within sixty days, CODFA
would require any amount unpaid to be paid by the client or that unpaid
invoices be refactored and a credit
retention amount created which would have
to be paid by the client or alternatively, the client would have to issue CODFA
with new
invoices for this amount.
<P>

	<b>The Roles of Mr Wright, Mr and Mrs Walters and Mr Kull</b>
<P>

43	Mr Kull gave evidence that from the start of trading of CODFA in August
1991, Mr Wright held the position of managing director
of CODFA.  Mr Kull gave
evidence that from the start of trading of CODFA, he observed Mr Wright perform
various tasks including the
following tasks:
<P>

	.	Talking on the phone with prospective and existing clients, including
negotiating security and factoring arrangements with new
clients, and
discussing problems with existing client accounts such as outstanding
debtors.
<P>

.	Signing cheques which Mr Walters had prepared.
<P>

.	Talking on the phone with CODFA solicitors in order to arrange new factoring
agreements or obtaining security from clients.
<P>

.	Attending at monthly board meetings and signing any minutes from such
meetings.
<P>

44	Mr Kull's evidence was that his role in CODFA involved an attendance at
monthly board meetings at which time he was briefed about
new clients and
reviewed financial information from the previous month which was prepared by Mr
Walters.  Mr Wright occasionally
contacted Mr Kull between board meetings to
discuss various matters.  Mr Kull also attended the office and assisted in the
installation
and operation of a new computer system.
<P>

45	From the start of trading of CODFA, Mr Kull observed Mr Walters perform the
following tasks at CODFA's offices:
<P>

	.	Entering information into the computer, relating to CODFA's ledger
accounts.
<P>

.	Preparing reports which Mr Walters provided at monthly board meetings,
including a trial balance of all debtors, this being an
aged trial balance for
clients' debtors which indicated if debtors were over 90 days, details of
receipts and fees from all clients,
and profit and loss reports and balance
sheets for each previous month.
<P>

.	Drawing and signing cheques on behalf of CODFA in relation to St George bank
account No. 100170533 and later a Burkett account
No. 10020185 held at the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and CODFA's CBA account No. 10026675.  The
cheques which Mr Walters prepared,
were for the following purposes:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	payments to clients of CODFA,
<P>

(ii)	payments of interest on CODFA loan accounts,
<P>

(iii)	payment of dividends by CODFA on year end Profit and Loss,
<P>

(iv)	payment to Dubois and Walters Pty Limited and to Walters and Associates
for services provided,
<P>

(v)	employee wages,
<P>

(vi)	other miscellaneous expenses.
<P>

.	Checking First Schedules received from clients and making adjustments on the
amount on the First Schedule for debit retention
and factoring fees charged by
CODFA.
<P>

.	Talking to clients on the telephone in relation to the repayment of advances
to clients.
<P>

.	Telephoning CODFA's banks to determine what cheques had been presented and
deposits cleared on the previous day so as to determine
a daily balance on
CODFA's account.
<P>

.	Typing out letters to prospective clients which referred to the terms and
conditions of CODFA's factoring.
<P>

.	Preparing any minutes of meetings for monthly board meetings.
<P>

46	Mr Kull saw Mrs Walters on most days that he attended the office.  From the
start of trading at CODFA, he observed Mrs Walters
performing various tasks
including answering telephone calls, transferring telephone calls or leaving
messages;  opening mail and
attending at the post office to send out mail;
recording receipt of cheques by entering the fact that such receipts had been
received
into the computer for each debtor ledger of the client that the cheque
related to, and printing out a journal of receipts for each
client and faxing
them to the client.
<P>

47	Mr Kull also observed Mrs Walters typing up letters for CODFA and
photocopying for CODFA.  He also observed Mrs Walters writing
up CODFA's bank
deposit books and leaving the office with those books and cheques enclosed.
<P>

48	On several occasions, Mr Kull heard Mrs Walters say to Mr Walters and to Mr
Wright and himself during monthly meetings, that
she was going home at the time
and would do the banking on the way home.
<P>

49	Mr Kull gave evidence that Mr and Mrs Walters rendered to CODFA invoices for
the accounting, administrative, banking and secretarial
work undertaken by
them.  These invoices were initially in the name of Dubois &amp; Walters Pty
Limited, but from about October 1993,
were in the name of Walters &amp;
Associates.  [I interpolate that Walters &amp; Associates is a business name,
the proprietors of
which are Mr Edmund Walters and Mrs Walters.  I interpolate
also that a company search of Dubois &amp; Walters Pty Limited showed
that Mr
and Mrs Walters were directors of that company.]  The invoices were issued
monthly and the amount payable was based on a
fixed percentage of factoring
fees received by CODFA over the previous month, as well as an extra amount
based on an hourly rate
for the preparation of reports for clients which CODFA
would charge to the clients.
<P>

50	The invoices were presented at monthly meetings and Mr Kull signed a cheque
for the invoice amount.
<P>

51	In about June 1993, the clients of Factors were assigned to CODFA.  [See the
Deed of Variation dated 30 June 1993].  At about
this time, Mr Wright said to
Mr Kull:  "From 30 June 1993 I'll transfer COD Factors' clients over to
CODFA".
<P>

52	The pay-out figure of Factors' clients which is equivalent to the invoice
amount on current First Schedules, less debit retention
and factoring fees, was
treated as a loan from Factors to CODFA.
<P>

53	In about December 1992, Mr Wright and Mr Kull had a discussion when Mr
Wright said:  "We need someone to act as company secretary
who is available at
any time.  You are only in the office to sign documents and cheques once a
month at board meetings, so it would
be better if we had someone who works in
the office.  Ed Walters could become the secretary.  He is in the office at all
times and
he can help me sign documents".
<P>

54	Mr Kull then agreed with Mr Wright to have Mr Walters made secretary of
CODFA jointly with himself.  Mr Walters was appointed
secretary of CODFA on 17
December 1992.
<P>

55	All cheques of CODFA had to be signed by any two of the office holders of
CODFA.  Mr Kull observed on several occasions that
Mr Walters brought to Mr
Wright cheques that Mr Walters had prepared for Mr Wright to sign.  Details on
the cheques included the
payee and the amount.
<P>

56	Mr Wright either signed the cheque at that time or signed it later and
returned it to Mr Walters.  Some of the cheques signed
by Mr Wright had First
Schedules attached and some did not.
<P>

57	Mr Kull would sign CODFA cheques when he attended at monthly board meetings.
Cheques which he signed included those relating
to payment of loan interest and
dividends to Kylon and Factors, payment of monthly management fees to Factors,
payment to Dubois
&amp; Walters Pty Limited and later Walters &amp; Associates
for the service fees of Mr and Mrs Walters, and payments to clients.
<P>

	<b>The Involvement of Mr and Mrs Burkett</b>
<P>

58	In about 1994, CODFA required further loan funds to meet the factoring
requirements of its clients.  At that time, Mr Wright
and Mr Walters approached
Mr Burkett for such funds.
<P>

59	On 11 July 1994, a Loan Agreement was executed between Mr Royce Burkett and
Mrs Penelope Burkett and CODFA which created an overdraft
facility for the use
of CODFA, secured by a charge over the company.  The agreement was varied two
years later.  The initial Deed
of Loan was dated 11 July 1994 and an initial
Deed of Equitable Charge was executed, dated 11 July 1994 [PXC B16-35].  Later
a Deed
of Variation of Loan dated 11 July 1996 was entered into [PXC
B36-38].
<P>

60	The overdraft facility was with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the
name of Royce and Penelope Burkett account No. 10020185.
 For this facility,
CODFA paid the Burketts $600 per month and also paid to the CBA, any interest
costs on the overdraft facility.
 In September 1996, the payment to the
Burketts for the use of their overdraft facility was decreased from $600 to
$500.
<P>

61	The signatories to this account were Mr Walters, Mr Burkett and Mrs Burkett.
Two signatories were required for cheques.
<P>

	<b>Creation of Cashflow Finance Pty Limited</b>
<P>

62	In about June 1994, Mr Kull became aware that Mr Wright had advertised for
new investors to invest in factoring.  At about that
time, Mr Wright had a
conversation with Mr Kull, in which words to the following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Wright:	I have found new investors to put in money for factoring.  I
will create a new factoring company to generate new business
with this money.
The new company can operate from these offices.  I will manage the new company
and Ed Walters will provide accounting
and financial services.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Kull:	I want any new investor to place funds into CODFA . . .  in order
to avoid a conflict of interest between any other company
and CODFA in relation
to CODFA's current and future client base.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:	I don't agree to that.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Kull:	I want CODFA to have first choice of any new clients.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:	I'll have to discuss that with Tony Bonvino.'</i>
<P>

63	Cashflow was registered on 29 June 1994.
<P>

64	On 8 December 1994, Mr Bonvino and Mr Wright signed a minute of meeting that
CODFA was to have the first option of any new factoring
clients.
<P>

	<b>The Relationship Between CODFA and Cashflow</b>
<P>

65	In or about July 1994, Mr Kull had discussions with Mr Wright in relation to
the sharing of office expenses between Cashflow
and CODFA.  In one such
conversation, words to the following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Kull:	We need to work out a method for Cashflow to pay for office
expenses such as rent and electricity and other expenses such
as advertising,
computer costs, staff costs and your car and telephone expenses.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:	Office expenses can be apportioned based on fees received by
CODFA and Cashflow during the previous month.  Whomever receives
more fees pays
more expenses.'</i>
<P>

66	Mr Kull agreed to this.  This method of sharing expenses was maintained up
until Mr Star was appointed as provisional liquidator
of Cashflow in September
1996.  A similar arrangement had previously been in place between CODFA and
Factors before Factors transferred
its clients to CODFA.
<P>

67	From the time of Cashflow's creation, Mr Wright as managing director, shared
his time between CODFA and Cashflow.  On several
occasions when Mr Kull
attended the offices of CODFA, he overhead Mr Walters say to Mr Wright that
there was a phone call for him
and he heard Mr Walters name that person;
although Mr Kull could not recall the specific name any longer he recognised
that the person
was not a client nor representative of any client of CODFA.  Mr
Wright, to Mr Kull's recollection, would on most occasions, speak
to these
persons whilst Mr Kull was present.  Mr Kull also overhead on several occasions
Mr Walters say to Mr Wright words to the
effect:  "Tony Bonvino is on the phone
for you".  Mr Wright would then answer the telephone call.
<P>

68	After Cashflow commenced business, Mr Wright's management fees for work
performed on behalf of CODFA, remained at 5% of fees
earned by CODFA during the
previous month.
<P>

69	Mr Walters shared his time between Cashflow and CODFA.  It was Mr Kull's
understanding that the work Mr Walters undertook for
both companies was similar
in terms of the provision of accounting and financial services and the
preparing of monthly reports for
review by Cashflow directors at monthly board
meetings.  Mr Kull observed Mr Walters preparing cheques in Cashflow's Westpac
account
cheque book which Mr Walters would give to Mr Wright to sign.  Mr
Walters would also prepare a monthly invoice of fees payable to
CODFA from
Cashflow for office expenses, based on the fee sharing arrangement to which I
have referred.
<P>

70	First Schedules relating to Cashflow's clients, to the best of Mr Kull's
recollection, were held in a cabinet in the office space
across from the office
of Mr Walters and Mr Wright.
<P>

71	Mr Kull did not meet the effective majority shareholder of Cashflow, Mr
Bonvino, until about September 1994.  Mr Kull had had
no role in the running or
operations of Cashflow.
<P>

72	In about September 1994, CODFA required further loan money in order to
factor outstanding invoices of it's client, Amber Technology
Pty Limited
[`Amber Technology'].  At about this time, Mr Wright and Mr Kull had a
conversation to the following effect:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Wright:	I can speak to Tony Bonvino about getting money from Cashflow
at an appropriate interest rate.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Kull:	We should pay interest on such moneys at a rate equivalent to what
Cashflow would be earning on those moneys if they were
using those moneys for
factoring with their clients.'</i>
<P>

73	CODFA then borrowed $170,000 from Cashflow at an interest rate of 3.5% per
month which was the equivalent of fees that would
be earned on the factoring of
such moneys.  An agreement was signed by Mr Wright, Mr Bonvino and Mr Kull
which is undated.  It reads,
inter alia:
<P>

	<i>`Further to our most recent discussions we now confirm our offer to
transfer all the rights and title of our factoring client AMBER
TECHNOLOGY PTY
LTD upon the receipt of the payout owing to C.O.D. FACTORS AUSTRALIA PTY
LTD.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is further agreed that you will make funds available to C.O.D. FACTORS
AUSTRALIA PTY LTD upon receipt of this letter, so that
it may factor the gross
outstanding invoices of Amber Technology Pty Ltd in the amount of $220,000
(requiring $150,000) prior to
transfer.</i>
<P>

<i>	INTEREST ON LOAN FUNDS</i>
<P>

<i>	We will pay interest equal to 3.5% per month calculated on daily rest.
This interest is payable on changeover settlement.</i>
<P>

<i>	We make this offer in good faith and without reservation.'</i>
<P>

74	The amount was repaid with interest within two months.
<P>

75	At no other time was Mr Kull asked to sign a document authorising any other
loan of moneys between CODFA and Cashflow, nor was
he told of any other loan
between CODFA and Cashflow.  Until 12 August 1996, the only inter-company
exchange of funds of which he
was aware, was the loan of $170,000 referred to
above.  Nothing regarding any such exchange of funds was raised for discussion
in
the monthly meetings.
<P>

76	In about September 1994, Amber Technology ceased to be a client of CODFA and
became a client of Cashflow.
<P>

77	In about February 1996, Mr Wright and Mr Kull attended at the Beverley Hills
Branch of the CBA and opened account no. 10026675
on behalf of CODFA.  Most of
the bank deposits and withdrawals of CODFA after this date occurred from this
account.  The signatories
to this CBA account were Mr Wright, Mr Walters and Mr
Kull.  Any two signatures were required for cheques to be met by the bank.
<P>

78	In the months leading up to 12 August 1996, Mr Walters started to be late in
providing, and for the month of June failed to provide
altogether, monthly
client aged ledgers and financial information in respect of CODFA's performance
over the previous month.  At
a board meeting in about April 1996, Mr Kull had a
discussion with Mr Walters to the following effect:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Kull:	Ed, why are you continually late in providing reports as to
client aged debtors and as to the previous month's financial
performance of
CODFA?</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:	I am very busy at the moment.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Kull:	When will we have them?</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:	In a few weeks.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Discovery of Transfer of Moneys - The 12 August 1996 Meeting</b>
<P>

79	The issue of precisely what was said on 12 August 1996 when a meeting took
place at the offices of the two companies, attended
by Mr Wright, Mr Walters
and Mr Bonvino, requires close attention to the two versions of the events
respectively given by Mr Kull
and by Mr Bonvino.
<P>

80	In paragraph 51 of Mr Kull's statement of 14 April 1998, he stated that at
the meeting Mr Walters had said:
<P>

	<i>`I have transferred moneys between CODFA and Cashflow for the purpose of
Cashflow's factoring with it's clients.  The net result of
the transfer of
moneys is that $180,000 is owed by Cashflow to CODFA.  I have also advanced
funds to Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited
directly out of CODFA's account with
the CBA.'</i>
<P>

81	In his statement, Mr Kull also said that Mr Walters then presented a
handwritten list of electronic transactions between May
and August 1996 which
showed that money had been transferred from CODFA to Trans-pac Australia Pty
Limited.  Mr Kull referred to
the handwritten list of transactions prepared by
Mr Walters and annexed to his statement a copy of that document and said in his
statement that Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited to his knowledge was not a
client of CODFA.
<P>

82	The electronic transfers occurred out of the CBA account no. 10026675.  The
recovery of such transfers is the subject of separate
proceedings in the
Supreme Court, Equity Division - 2045 of 1997.
<P>

83	Mr Bonvino in his affidavit of 27 April 1998, gave evidence as to his
recollection of the same meeting.  His evidence was that
he had met Mr Wright
and Mr Walters prior to meeting Mr Kull.  His further evidence was that at the
meeting at which all four were
present, Mr Walters said:
<P>

	<i>`[Tony, I worked on this all week-end.]  </i><cite>Here is a P&amp;L and
trial balance.  You have found me out finally.  You know that it will never
balance because what you want, I
can't give you.  I have been lying and
deceitful for the past year and a half at least</cite><i>.  [I altered the
Trans-pac ledger at the end of last year by putting a journal entry of $140,000
as a receipt from Trans-pac when
in essence this did not happen].
</i><cite>Since then, I have made advances to Trans-pac without completing
First Schedules and without following procedures</cite><i>.  [I think you are
going to be missing $1.16million and at the same time] </i><cite>COD Australia
is missing about $460,000</cite><i>.'</i>  [emphasis added?]
<P>

84	Mr Bonvino in the same affidavit also gave evidence that upon hearing Mr
Walters' statements, he became extremely upset as he
understood that what Mr
Walters was telling him was that the `profit' which had been declared at the
end of the 30 June 1995 financial
year, should not have been declared, and that
Cashflow may well have suffered a loss depending on the collectability of the
advances
made to Trans-pac No 1.
<P>

85	Mr Bonvino's evidence in his affidavit was that after he calmed down he said
to Mr Walters and to Mr Wright "I don't understand
this.  I gave you both
strict instructions that you should not advance Trans-pac any funds without
proper procedures being followed.
 As far as I am concerned you are both
accountable for this.  You both have deceived me and I'm taking control of
Cashflow to try
and sort out this mess."
<P>

86	Mr Bonvino in his affidavit then gave evidence that he said to Mr Walters
"Show me every transaction which has occurred between
Cashflow and Trans-pac"
and that he had selected Trans-pac because Mr Walters had said to him "All the
problems are in Trans-pac's
accounts".
<P>

87	Mr Bonvino had in the same affidavit denied that the conversation at which
he was present, was to the effect set out in paragraph
51 of Mr Kull's
statement.
<P>

88	Mr Bonvino was not cross-examined on this denial.
<P>

89	In the course of being cross-examined by Mr Campbell QC, Mr Bonvino's
version of the conversation which took place at the meeting
on 12 August 1996
was put to Mr Kull.  He accepted a deal of Mr Bonvino's version of what Mr
Walters had said.  I have caused to
be underlined in paragraph 83 above those
sections of Mr Walters' statements at the meeting which Mr Bonvino had sworn
had been said
and which Mr Kull agreed had been said.  I have also marked in
square brackets in paragraph 83 above, those sections of Mr Bonvino's
evidence
as to what Mr Walters said which Mr Kull could not recall having been said or
could not recall all of the detail suggested.
 [See transcript 18-3-1999 pages
33-35]
<P>

90	Also under cross-examination, Mr Campbell put to Mr Kull that he had been
booked to leave Australia on a fairly lengthy overseas
holiday and to leave on
17 August 1996 so that during the days immediately before that departure date,
he was quite busy with preparing
for his overseas trip.  Mr Kull accepted that
this was correct.
<P>

91	At transcript page 34, on 18 March 1999, the following evidence was given by
Mr Kull under cross-examination:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	Now, could I suggest to you that it was only after your return from
overseas that you found out about the unauthorised loans that
Mr Walters had
been making from Cashflow to CODFA and back again?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is right yes. . . .'</i>
<P>

92	In re-examination, Mr Lindsay took Mr Kull back to paragraph 51 of his
witness statement of 15 April 1998 and the following evidence
was given:
<P>

	<i>`Q.	I just want to clear up what may be a discrepancy in that statement.
Do you say that on 12 August 1996 Mr Walters made some comment
about
inter-company money transfers between CODFA and Cashflow, see that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I do.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	As I heard your evidence in answer to the questions from Mr Campbell, you
suggested that you first heard about those transfers
after you returned from
overseas or returned from holidays, rather.  Can you direct your mind as to the
time . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Now I am not too sure whether it was mentioned before I went but it
certainly wasn't the amount of money was talked about.  It
is a bit hard to
remember how exactly whether it was before or after I came back."</i>
<P>

93	In those circumstances, an issue is raised as between the evidence of Mr
Kull and that of Mr Bonvino on whether or not information
about the Walters'
Unauthorised Payments, in the sense of the inter-company money transfers, was
given on 12 August 1996.  To my
mind, Mr Kull's recollection has been shown
under his cross-examination to be unclear and in the result, in my view, it is
Mr Bonvino's
version of the events in question which is to be preferred.  This
is not to suggest that Mr Kull did anything otherwise than his
best to recall
the events in question.  The fact is, however, that his recollection on this
matter has been shown to be somewhat
unclear under cross-examination and there
being an issue about the matter, to my mind the probabilities favour Mr
Bonvino's recollections.
<P>

94	In about September 1996, Mr Walters gave Mr Kull a document, saying to him
words to the effect:  `Here's a ledger I created which
indicates the
transactions between Cashflow and CODFA'.
<P>

95	The ledger recorded payments made between CODFA and Cashflow and from CODFA
to Cashflow's clients.
<P>

96	Later, on 12 August 1996, Mr Kull spoke with Mr Walters and words to the
following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Kull:	Why did you do it Ed, is there a reason?</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:	I don't know why.  I just did it.  I know it was stupid.'</i>
<P>

97	Sometime between 12 August and 17 August 1996, there was a meeting between
Mr Walters, Mr Wright and Mr Kull.  At that meeting,
Mr Wright said to Mr
Walters words to the effect:
<P>

	<i>"Why did you give the money to Trans-pac, did you have any association with
the Panayi?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters replied:	"I received no personal benefit at all:  I don't know
why I did it."</i>
<P>

98	In the days following 12 August 1996, Mr Bonvino and Mr Walters worked at
the offices of CODFA in order to reconstruct the transactions
that had occurred
between CODFA and Cashflow and Cashflow clients.  At this time, Mr Bonvino said
to Mr Kull that he wanted to get
to the bottom of the transactions and wanted
to track the paperwork.
<P>

99	A few days later, Mr Bonvino told Mr Kull that he had gone through all the
transactions, cheque butts, statements, printed ledgers
and checked the deposit
books to reconstruct who had received what funds.
<P>

100	On about 17 August 1996, Mr Kull went overseas for approximately one month
and during that period of time he appointed his son-in-law,
Mr Poggi as an
alternative director and as his representative by Power of Attorney.
<P>

101	On 21 August 1996, Mr Walters resigned as secretary of Cashflow and as
secretary of CODFA.
<P>

102	In late August 1996, CODFA employed Mr Russell Johnson of Adair Management
Services, to undertake work that had previously been
done by Mr Walters.  On 29
August 1996, Mr Johnson was appointed secretary of CODFA.
<P>

103	From August 1996 to October 1996, Mr Walters remained at CODFA to assist Mr
Johnson to learn the standard procedures and computer
systems at CODFA.  In
approximately October 1996, Mr Walters stopped working at the offices of
CODFA.
<P>

104	When Mr Kull returned from overseas in about late September 1996, he was
informed by Mr Wright and Mr Poggi of the appointment
of Mr Star as the
provisional liquidator of Cashflow on 12 September 1996, on the application of
Pyrafount by summons.
<P>

105	Mr Kull had several conversations with Mr Wright at this time, including a
conversation in which the following was said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Kull:	Why did you sign all the cheques Peter when they were for
Cashflow's clients or for Cashflow?</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:	I would sign anything in front of me that had a schedule with it
but I would not sign blank cheques, cheques made out with
no amount or no
payees.  I don't think I signed cheques for Cashflow clients.'</i>
<P>

106	On about 25 September 1996, Mr Wright on behalf of CODFA, requested copies
of CODFA cheques paid from the St George bank account
which related to the
payment of moneys to Cashflow and its clients.  These cheques are detailed in
schedule 1 to the amended statement
of claim in proceedings 50177 of 1997.
<P>

107	On about 23 and 30 October 1996, Mr Wright and Mr Kull on behalf of CODFA,
signed two surrender of paid cheques agreements with
St George Bank.
<P>

108	During the period September 1996 to about January 1997, Mr Kull had several
conversations with the St George Bank Manager at
the Parramatta Branch, Mr
David Rollo and an employee at that branch whom he knew.  During such
conversations, he repeatedly requested
copies of cheques paid from CODFA's
accounts cleared at that Bank.  In about January 1997, CODFA received copies of
cheques requested
from St George.
<P>

109	On about 25 September, 1996, Mr Johnson on behalf of CODFA, requested from
the CBA, copies of CODFA cheques paid from the CBA
account which related to the
payment of moneys to Cashflow and its clients.  These cheques are also detailed
in schedule 1 to the
amended statement of claim in proceedings 50177 of
1997.
<P>

110	On about 7 November 1996, Mr Burkett requested from the CBA, copies of
Burkett account no. 10020185 cheques which related to
the payment of moneys to
Cashflow and it's clients.  These cheques are also detailed in schedule 1.
<P>

111	Cheques which were not located by the St George Bank for CODFA's account
and the CBA Burkett account, were cheques numbered
2044, 6924, 6925 and
0029.
<P>

112	The signatures of both Mr Walters and Mr Wright appeared on a number of the
cheques.  These are identified in paragraph 70 of
Mr Kull's statement of 14
April 1998.
<P>

113	Mr Kull then had a conversation with Mr Wright in which he referred to
these cheques and said:  
<P>

	<i>`Peter, these cheques show that you signed them.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright responded:   I can see that I have signed them but I cannot
explain why I did so and I did not sign blank cheques.'</i>
<P>

114	In the course of the evidence, paragraph 74 of Mr Kull's first statement of
14 April 1998 was pressed and read only against
parties otherwise than
Cashflow.  Paragraph 74 was in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`In or about September 1997, Edmund Walters, Peter Wright and myself had a
meeting.  At this meeting Mr Walters produced a one page
summary which
indicated fees received by Cashflow from Trans-pac Container Freight Services
Pty Limited between the period September
1994 and September 1996.   . . . A
conversation ensued with words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>Edmund Walters:  "I prepared this sheet based on the list of transactions
between Cashflow and Trans-pac Container Freight Services
Pty Limited that has
been supplied by John Star.  It reconciles and summarises such amounts between
September 1994 and September
1996.  This sheet shows that Cashflow received
money from Trans-pac Container Freight Services Pty Limited up until the last
six
months of transactions between the two companies.  Cashflow definitely
profited up to February 1996."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:  "Why did you make payments from the CODFA accounts to
Trans-pac?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:  "There was no good reason to make payments from the CODFA
account to Trans-pac."</i>
<P>

115	During the period from about October 1996 until January 1997, Mr Kull
reviewed copies of cheques drawn on the CODFA's bank accounts
with the St
George Bank and the CBA and also the Burkett accounts.  At the same time, Mr
Kull reviewed the schedule of unauthorised
movement of funds between CODFA,
Cashflow and clients of Cashflow which had been prepared for CODFA by Mr Graham
Green.
<P>

116	Mr Kull observed that the signatures of Mr Walters and Mr Wright appeared
on a number of cheques which he identifies in paragraph
76 of his statement of
14 April 1998.
<P>

117	Mr Kull had no prior knowledge that any of those cheques had been drawn,
signed and given to the respective bearers for payment
and Mr Kull did not at
the time or subsequently, authorise any of the payments.
<P>

118	Mr Kull also observed that the signatures of Mr Walters and Mr Burkett
appeared on the four cheques identified in paragraph
77 of his said statement.
Mr Kull had no prior knowledge that any of these cheques had been drawn, signed
and given to Cashflow for
payment and did not, at the time or subsequently,
authorise any of those payments.
<P>

119	As to cheque numbers 6450, 0161 and 0214, Mr Kull gave evidence that they
had been signed only by Mr Walters and that Mr Kull
had no prior knowledge that
any of those cheques had been drawn, signed and given to Cashflow for payment.
His evidence was that
he did not, at the time nor subsequently, authorise any
of those payments.
<P>

120	Mr Kull also ascertained that three electronic fund transfers were made out
of the CBA account to clients of Cashflow.  He details
those transfers in
paragraph 79 of his said statement.  He gave evidence that he had no prior
knowledge of any of those payments
and did not at the time or subsequently
authorise any of those payments.
<P>

121	Mr Kull also gave evidence that he had seen copies of two cheques written
to clients of CODFA which were in fact paid to Cashflow.
 His evidence was that
he observed that those two cheques had been crossed and marked `not
negotiable'.  Neither the front nor the
back of either cheque contained any
writing or marking that would indicate that the cheque had been endorsed in
favour of another
party.
<P>

122	The detail of those two cheques is identified in paragraph 80 of Mr Kull's
said statement.
<P>

123	Mr Kull reviewed bank statements for CODFA's St George Bank account and
Cashflow's Westpac account as well.  Copies of those
bank statements are
identified in paragraph 81 of Mr Kull's said statement.  Mr Kull's evidence was
that he observed that on 17 August
1995, CODFA's account had been debited in
the amount of $30,000 through payment of cheque number 6549.  He also observed
that on
17 August 1995, Cashflow's account had been credited with $30,000.  He
observed that on 18 August 1995, CODFA's account had been
debited in the sum of
$50,000 through payment of cheque number 6545.  He also observed that on 18
August 1995, Cashflow's account
had been credited with $50,000.
<P>

124	Mr Kull gave evidence that he had become aware that deposits had been made
into CODFA's accounts which were not from clients
of CODFA nor were from moneys
received in the ordinary course of CODFA's business.  He referred in that
regard to the schedule of
unauthorised movement of funds prepared by Mr Graham
Green and identified in paragraph 82 of Mr Kull's statement.  A number of those
payments are referred to in paragraphs 10(a) and 10(b) in the second
cross-claim in proceedings 50111 of 1997.  Mr Kull's evidence
was that he did
not at the time that those deposits were made, nor subsequently, authorise
those deposits to be made.
<P>

	<b>Evidence of Mr Bonvino</b>
<P>

125	Mr Bonvino's mid-1994 response to the advertisement referred to in
paragraph 7 has already been referred to.  It is appropriate
to now set out in
more detail certain of Mr Bonvino's evidence as to the events thereafter.
<P>

	<b>Early Meetings</b>
<P>

126	A few days after the advertisement, Mr Bonvino met with Mr Wright at the
Beverley Hills office to which I have referred.  As
earlier stated, at this
time, this was the office of both Factors and CODFA.  At the meeting, Mr Wright
told Mr Bonvino about his
qualifications and experience and handed to him a
brochure relating to Factors.  The brochure presented Factors as `the business
finance specialists' and was directed to persons or businesses with a cash flow
problem entitled `Survival in the `90s - Cashflow
- Run your business on
C.O.D.'.
<P>

127	At the same time, Mr Wright handed to Mr Bonvino a document entitled
`Company and Management's History', dealing with Factors
which presented the
business of Factors as ten years of successful profitable trading.  Factors was
said to provide debt factoring
finance for small to medium sized businesses
which are profitable and backed by a reasonable level of assets.
<P>

128	CODFA was referred to in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`Owing to the significant demand for our services another company known as
[CODFA] was formed in 1991.  [CODFA] was formed by the
founding director, Peter
Wright together with a financing equity partner.  As the financial statements
record this company has enjoyed
exceptional growth and profitability under the
control and guidance of the founding Managing Director.  Once again, owing to
the
demand for our services [CODFA] has reached its projected budget limits and
now seeks investment capital in order for the company
to fulfil the demands of
its expanding client base . . .'</i>
<P>

129	During this meeting, Mr Wright said to Mr Bonvino words to the effect:
`The business opportunity here is to provide the finance
to enable another
factoring business to start up.  I am running an existing factoring business,
and what I intend to do is to duplicate
it as a separate entity, and run it
here from my office.  I have the accounting system all set up and we could just
add another business
to it.  It would be no problem.  Also, I have an excellent
accountant, Ed Walters, who I have known for ten years, is honest, hard
working
and diligent.  We have no problems in accommodating extra work'.
<P>

130	After considering the information made available to him at the meeting, Mr
Bonvino a short time later again met Mr Wright at
the Beverley Hills office.  A
conversation took place in which words to the following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Bonvino:   I am in a position to be able to raise capital through my
own efforts and also through my client base.  I would seriously
be interested
in pursuing a partnership on the basis that I arrange for the finance and I
would at all times have a controlling interest
in the company because I would
have the most to lose.  Due to your experience, I would be happy to give you
the day to day running
of the operation for which you would be responsible and
be paid for.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   I would be happy to do it that way because I'm already doing it
with another partner, but I don't like giving you control,
you could have a
charge over the company instead.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   I would rather not muck around with a charge because it is a
bit messy and I would rather have 51% of the company because
it's a lot
neater.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   I will think about that.  I understand that you want control
because you are putting up all the money, but I will think
about which
alternative is better.'</i>
<P>

131	All in all, Mr Bonvino held several meetings with Mr Wright following the
date of the advertisement and before late June early
July 1994.  He had a
number of conversations with Mr Wright at Mr Wright's office at Beverley Hills.
In each of those meetings, only
he and Mr Wright attended although he was
introduced on an early occasion to Mr Walters and spoke with Mr Walters on
several occasions
after that, mainly to obtain information.  The conversations
which Mr Bonvino was able to recollect were as follows:
<P>

	<i>(a)	Mr Bonvino:  "I want to find out how good your operation is, by you
giving me your balance sheet and P and L for your existing
company.'</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:    "I don't have a problem with that as long as you keep it
confidential".</i>
<P>

<i>	At that meeting, Mr Walters presented Mr Bonvino with a copy of the balance
sheet and profit and loss statement of Factors and CODFA.
 </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Mr Bonvino:  "I am very concerned about the funds that I would be
putting in because they belong to friends and clients and I
would to make sure
that I have control otherwise I will not be comfortable about putting the money
in."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "Yes, I understand your concern, we will work out a way to
make sure you get control."</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Mr Bonvino:   "How is this going to be run?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "Don't be concerned Tony, I have been doing this for ten
years.  I have a very good accountant in Ed Walters who helps
me.  His wife Lyn
helps him.  He works specifically for this operation only and does not do any
outside work.  You can rest assured
that he is honest, hard working and
reliable.  I will do the marketing and liaise with and manage all new clients
and instruct solicitors
to get the factoring deeds in place.  I will instruct
Ed Walters and be responsible for him and Ed Walters will do all the data
collection
and processing.  He will do a daily and report to me directly.  We
can have a board meeting every month to review performance and
at that board
meeting, we can arrange payment of my management fee for running the show,
process fees for Ed Walters, and the interest
payable to investors."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "The interest to investors has to be the priority."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "That's okay, the investors will get paid first and Walters
and I will get paid second."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "What are you getting at present for your
managements?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "I am getting 5% of profits, and all overhead expenses are
being covered by fees received.  Five percent and overheads
are paid monthly.
At the end of the financial year, I pick up 50% of the profits as an extra
bonus.  Ed Walters gets about 10% of
fees collected for data processing on a
monthly basis."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "Well, I am happy with all of that if that is what you are
getting at the moment, because you are running the show
but interest to
investors should be paid first.  I would also be happy enough if I got my
return on my investment at the end of the
year, as I am not there day to day.
I would want at least 50% of the profit."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "That's okay because I have that arrangement with COD Factors
Australia at present."</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Mr Bonvino:   "Explain to me how you put on a new client."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "Tony, I do extensive marketing by sending out brochures,
advertising in yellow pages and Sydney Morning Herald.  When
we receive a
response I interview the prospective client.  I look at their business and
check its profitability.  If I decide to
proceed with the factoring
arrangement, it is always a condition that my company gets a charge over their
company.  If there is any
available equity in property, I get a mortgage over
that.  Failing that, we start a security account, which builds up to 30% of the
factoring pay-out as an extra security.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "Does a security account mean that you put money in a
separate bank account, and if you do, on what basis do you do
it?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "Yes, that is what it is but what we do is that every time we
factor, we take 5% and put it in the account.  In other
words, 5% of the
advance gets placed into this account, and in view of the fact that we only
advance 80% of the debtors, there is
a security buffer of 25% when you put both
together, when you first factor.  However, we keep adding to the security
account and
eventually it builds up to 30%, so that overall, you have got a
security buffer of 50%.  I have been running COD Factors Australia
for three
years and I have never had a hiccup."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "When you have the prospective client, what do you do to get
him on board?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "First of all, I get a $500 deposit to process him.  This is
not refundable and is paid to the solicitor to draw up
the legal documents.  I
then send out a base proposal and a questionnaire to be completed giving
information relating to personal
and company assets.  When this comes back, we
look at them and if everything is okay we proceed to draw up a factoring deed
and any
security documents that go with it.  We present the factoring deed and
security documents to the prospective client and after they
are reviewed by
their solicitor, they are signed and then we are able to proceed.  We never
factor without entering into a factoring
deed and proper security documents.
Everything is checked by our solicitor and stamp duty is paid and where
appropriate, security
documents are registered.  We do everything possible to
protect your investment."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "I understand you are purchasing debtors but explain to me
what procedures you adopt to safeguard and check that what
we are purchasing is
correct."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "The factoring deed has a schedule which is called the First
Schedule.  It is filled out by the client every time they
factor any debts.
The schedule sets out the total invoice value to be factored.  The initial fee
is deducted from that.  We then
take away our security which is the retention.
What we do then is to forward to the customer the net value after those
deductions.
 We never factor without the customer completing a First Schedule.
Before we do that, we spot check the debtors we purchase to check
the validity
of them, and make sure they are collectible.  In other words, they are not in
dispute and there is no counter-claim.
 If we are taking extra security, we
deduct 5% from the amount that we send to the customer.  This is placed in a
separate account.
 If we have a second mortgage over a property to at least 30%
of the amount to be advanced, we do not deduct the extra security."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "What about collections?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "No worries, we have a trial balance with an ageing, and we do
a monthly reconciliation with the client.  Whenever the
debt becomes 90 days or
over, we sell it back to them but we still hold it as extra security.  In other
words, we are still able
to collect it."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Bonvino:   "That sounds very safe as long as it is followed, I don't
think I have a problem."</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Wright:   "We never operate outside the First Schedule to a factoring
deed.  We never move without it.  If the client receives
payment direct from a
debtor and deposits that cheque into their account, we come down very hard on
them and ask for an immediate
reversal.  It is part of the deed.  Our deed is
so powerful we can do whatever we like."</i>
<P>

132	By the end of June or early July 1994, Mr Bonvino was feeling comfortable
with the investment following those conversations.
 He believed that Mr Wright
was a competent and experienced operator.  He knew from his personal dealings
with Mr Wright that Mr
Wright was a good salesman and skilled at selling
himself and his business.  Mr Bonvino thought that Mr Wright would be very good
at marketing and managing the business.  The office at Beverley Hills appeared
to be well run and was well presented.  Mr Bonvino
was impressed with the
software package that was in place and the general day to day running of the
operations.  The financial records
that had been provided to him were sound and
he was also impressed with Mr Walters.  He believed, as a result of the
conversations
he had held with Mr Wright, that there was very little risk, if
any, in providing the funds for a factoring operation, operated along
the lines
explained by Mr Wright.  He believed that potential customers were scrutinised
carefully, debtors to be factored were checked,
and that adequate security
arrangements would be kept.  Accordingly, Mr Bonvino decided to proceed and
commence a new business with
Mr Wright.  He then held another meeting with Mr
Wright in late June or early July 1995 in which words to the following effect
were
said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Bonvino:   "I am impressed with everything you have told me and I am
prepared to proceed, but only on the basis that I maintain
control.  In this
regard, me or my nominees will require 51% of the company.  You will get 49% on
the basis of your marketing and
management skills.  The existing remuneration
packages that you and Ed get at the moment are acceptable as well.  It will be
acceptable
to me if the new company pays it's share of the overhead expenses
for the office.  You and I will be directors."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "I agree with all of that.  Ed Walters can be company secretary
because he is already doing it for COD Australia."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "I want to start off this partnership on the basis that it is
fair and reasonable.  I think it is fair that I should
get 51% because I'm
putting all the money in, but I would agree to the shareholdings being made 50%
each, if you match my investment
dollar for dollar."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "Okay, that's fair.  What sort of funds can you get?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "I shouldn't have any problems getting $1million and probably
I can get more as I have access to funds overseas."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "Tony, let's start off with $1million and see where we go from
there.  I will go and market and work very hard and together
I think we can
make a lot of money."</i>
<P>

133	At the same meeting, Mr Bonvino and Mr Wright decided upon the name
`Cashflow Finance Pty Limited and selected a logo for their
letterhead.  The
conversation continued:
<P>

	<i>Mr Bonvino:   "I will want interest on my injection of capital, quite apart
from any dividends I get back as a shareholder.  That's
fair because you are
all getting fees."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "Okay we'll give you an interest rate of 7% above the Westpac
Indicator Lending Rate.  This is the same rate paid by
COD Australia."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "What would that be?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "About 16.75% at the moment.  I will prepare something in
writing just to confirm this side of it.  You will get paid
monthly."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "Okay."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Cashflow is Acquired</b>
<P>

134	Arrangements were then made for a company called COD Factors (No. 1) Pty
Limited which Mr Wright already apparently held shares
in, to change its name
to Cashflow Finance Pty Limited.  Shortly after this Mr Wright, Mr Walters and
Mr Bonvino visited the Beverley
Hills branch of Westpac Bank and opened an
account in the name of Cashflow.  There was a conversation at that time in
which Mr Bonvino
said in the presence of a person he understood to be the
manager and in Mr Wright's presence:
<P>

	<i>"We will all be signatories on this account but I wish to maintain the
ability to take control in the event that I am not comfortable
with what's
happening with the company.  Otherwise, any two signatures can sign."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright said:   "That's acceptable."</i>
<P>

135	Mr Wright admits in the pleadings that he was at all material times the
managing director of Cashflow.  [Defence to amended
cross claim in proceedings
50177 of 1997]
<P>

136	A notice of authority to that effect was then signed.
<P>

137	At that time, Mr Bonvino drew a cheque on Pyrafount's account for $2,000
and Mr Wright drew a cheque on Factor's account for
$2,000 and they were
deposited into Cashflow's account to open the account.  Mr Wright was
reimbursed $740 for the purchase of the
company.  All funds advanced to
Cashflow after those initial deposits were advanced by Mr Bonvino's company,
Pyrafount, apart from
a deposit of $102,000 made by Mr Wright out of his
profits of Cashflow advanced in late 1995 and early 1996.
<P>

138	Under cover of letter dated 19 September 1994, Mr Wright forwarded to
Pyrafount, attention Mr Bonvino, a number of documents
including a draft
minute, reading:
<P>

	<i>`These points have been agreed to and will take the form of minutes in
place of a partnership agreement . . .</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Cashflow Finance Pty Limited</cite>
<P>

<i>	Points of be covered in the minutes:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.	Interest to be paid on loan funds (not working capital accounts) at the
rate of 7% above Westpac ILR (presently this would be
16.75%) with a ceiling of
20%.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Monthly payment of that loan fund interest.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	Conditions of loan fund withdrawal (replacement investor/funds prior
withdrawal).</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	Equal contribution of initial agreed working capital.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	Opening of company interest bearing bank cheque account.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	Signatories to bank account - Peter Wright, Antony Bonvino and Ed
Walters (any two signatures).</i>
<P>

<i>	7.	Describe the formula for sharing overhead expenses (suggested that this
be according to gross fees in each company) $22,000 was
total expenses in COD
Factors Australia Pty Limited in 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.	All factoring proposals will be approved by both shareholders before
acceptance.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.	Performance bonus payable to COD Factors Pty Limited be 5% of the gross
fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.	Data processing fees payable to Walters &amp; Associates be 10% of the
gross fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	11.	Shareholdings to be 51% (Bonvino or nominee) 49% (Wright or
nominee).'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Trans-pac No. 1</b>
<P>

139	Mr Bonvino gave evidence that the first client of Cashflow was Trans-pac
Container Freight Services Pty Limited, referred to
in this Judgment as
`Trans-pac No. 1' which is presently called Strathfield Information Processing
Bureau Pty Limited.  The client
was sourced by Mr Wright and Mr Wright and Mr
Walters brought the transaction to fruition.  The evidence adduced included:
<P>

	(a)	Factoring deed dated 1 September 1994 between Trans-pac No 1 and
Cashflow.
<P>

(b)	Company charge dated 1 September 1994 between Trans-pac No 1 and
Cashflow.
<P>

(c)	Certificate of entry of charge with respect to the charge.
<P>

(d)	Deed of guarantee and indemnity dated 1 September 1994 between Cashflow,
Trans-pac No. 1 and Antony Attallah, Terry Panayi and
Patricia Kyriacou.
<P>

(e)	Deed of indemnity and guarantee dated 16 February 1995 between Cashflow,
Trans-pac No. 1 and the persons named in the document
as guarantors.
<P>

(f)	Additional deed dated 16 February 1995 between Cashflow, Trans-pac No. 1
and Patricia Kyriacou.
<P>

(g)	Mortgage dated 16 February 1995 between Cashflow as mortgagee and Peter and
Elly Panayi as mortgagors.
<P>

(h)	Mortgage dated 16 February 1995 between Cashflow as mortgagee and Terry and
Patricia Panayi as mortgagors.
<P>

(i)	Mortgage dated 16 February 1995 between Cashflow as mortgagee and Terry and
Christopher Panayi as mortgagors.
<P>

140	Mr Bonvino gave evidence that initially, Cashflow adopted the practice of
transferring 5% of cash advances to a security account
in Trans-pac No.1's
name, but controlled by Cashflow, as an extra security over and above the
factor debts.  He gave evidence that
sometime prior to 16 February 1995, he had
a conversation with Mr Wright in which words to the following effect were
said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Wright:   "Tony, the Trans-pac directors are unhappy that we are holding
the 5% security deposit and they can't use the money.
 They want to use the
money and they have suggested that we take mortgages over their home as a
substitute for the security account."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "How much equity is in the homes after first
mortgages?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "About $600,000."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "Have you got a valuation done?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "I've sent the local agents to have a look and they say there's
no problem."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "Okay, sounds alright."</i>
<P>

141	Cashflow made it's first advance to Trans-Pac No. 1 of $147,409 on 1
September 1994 using funds advanced to it by Pyrafount.
 It was Mr Bonvino's
understanding from the conversations referred to above, that every time an
advance was made to Trans-pac No.
1 by Cashflow under the factoring deed, a new
First Schedule, completed in accordance with the example annexed to the
factoring deed,
would be completed.
<P>

142	After Trans-pac No. 1 became a client, Mr Wright invited Mr Bonvino to meet
Mr Terry Barnes of Trans-Pac No. 1, who was one
of the founding directors.  The
meeting was informal, Mr Barnes advised Mr Bonvino about the business of
Trans-Pac No. 1 and its
proposed sale to new owners.  Mr Bonvino also held an
informal meeting with the proposed purchasers of the business at the time,
Peter and Terry Panayi.  Mr Wright attended that meeting.
<P>

143	Mr Bonvino was never involved in the process of approving Trans-pac No. 1
as a client or reviewing the Trans-pac No. 1 account,
until August 1996, in
circumstances in respect of which he gave evidence.  He did not see any
financial accounts for Trans-pac No.
1 until he took control of the Trans-pac
No. 1 file from the office in August 1996.  He was not involved in the signing
of the factoring
deed.  Both Mr Wright and Mr Walters signed factoring deeds
and any other documents on behalf of Cashflow Finance.
<P>

144	Prior to 1 September 1994, Pyrafount advanced to Cashflow sufficient funds
to make the advance of $147,409.  When Cashflow needed
to make an advance to a
customer, Mr Bonvino received a phone call or a facsimile from Mr Wright.  Mr
Wright would say that he needed
Mr Bonvino to make another deposit into
Cashflow's account and would give him the amount.  Mr Wright would say:  `this
is for factoring
for Trans-pac.'
<P>

145	If it was required for a different client, Mr Wright would then name that
client.  Mr Bonvino then arranged for a cheque to
be drawn on Pyrafount's
account and for that cheque to be deposited into Cashflow's account.
<P>

146	A copy of the loan agreement between Pyrafount and Cashflow was tendered in
evidence.  The agreement reads:
<P>

	<i>`Whereas Pyrafount No. 3 Pty Limited will make loan advances to Cashflow
Finance Pty Limited.</i>
<P>

<i>These loan advances will attract an interest rate of 7% per annum in excess
of the Westpac Banking Corporation indicator lending rate
with a ceiling of 20%
per annum.</i>
<P>

<i>Interest on these loan advances are payable monthly within seven days after
the close of each business month.'</i>
<P>

147	The balance outstanding on the loan account as at 31 March 1998 was
$1,640,175.80 on Mr Bonvino's evidence.
<P>

148	Mr Bonvino gave evidence that when Cashflow commenced to trade, he felt
comfortable with the arrangements that he had made and
was content for Mr
Wright to market and manage the company and Walters &amp; Associates to supply
accounting services to Cashflow.
 He was very busy at this time himself,
working as an authorised representative for a firm and did not have any time to
spare to
get involved in the day to day running of Cashflow.  He held monthly
meetings with Mr Wright and Mr Walters which would take place
at the Beverley
Hills office during the day.  At these meetings, Mr Wright would report to Mr
Bonvino as to the events which had
taken place in the previous month and Mr
Walters would present to him a monthly profit and loss statement for Cashflow,
a monthly
trial balance, a summary of debtors purchased and fees received from
each client, and a trial balance showing the ageing of all debtors
purchased
for each client.  These reports disclosed a favourable trading performance.  At
the end of twelve months the books of Cashflow
indicated a total profit of
approximately $157,000.  Cashflow paid tax on this amount and dividends were
issued approximately six
months after the financial year of 30 June 1995.
Later, Mr Bonvino learned that the accounts were in error and a profit should
not
have been declared.
<P>

149	Mr Bonvino gave evidence in relation to the profit and loss statement and
balance sheet for the year ended 30 June 1995 in paragraph
17 of his statement
of 27 April 1998.
<P>

150	During the twelve month period, Cashflow acquired a number of other clients
and there was a turnover of clients who came and
went as factoring arrangements
began and finished.  One of the clients obtained by Cashflow in this period was
Amber Technology Pty
Limited.
<P>

	<b>Causes for Concern come to Mr Bonvino's Attention</b>
<P>

151	Mr Bonvino gave evidence that after about twelve months, he started to
notice certain matters which began to cause him concern.
 Previously, meetings
had been held approximately on the 11th or 12th of each month, but after
approximately a year of trading, the
meetings were being held later and later
in the month.  This evidence mirrors precisely that which Mr Kull gave as to
his experience.
 Mr Bonvino's evidence was that Mr Walters was becoming very
difficult to deal with and evaded questions and continually delayed
holding the
monthly board meetings.  When Mr Bonvino would question Mr Walters about the
delay in holding the meetings, the conversation
generally was in words to the
following effect:
<P>

	<i>Mr Walters:   "Tony, you don't understand what I'm doing.  You simply don't
understand.  It is very complex and I don't have time
to explain."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "Well explain it to me.  I have the time."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:   "I don't have time Tony, you just wouldn't understand
it."</i>
<P>

152	Mr Bonvino spoke to Mr Wright about these matters, the substance of the
conversations being:
<P>

	<i>Mr Bonvino:   "I think Ed Walters' behaviour towards me is unacceptable and
I think he should be replaced by another accountant. 
He won't explain things
to me and I feel he is holding information close to his chest."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:   "Tony, don't worry I have got it under control.  He has been
with me for so long he is just a bit unusual but he is honest
and hardworking
and I think we should keep him."</i>
<P>

153	Mr Bonvino continued to be unhappy with the performance of Mr Walters and
at his instigation, a meeting was arranged between
himself, Mr Wright and Mr
Kull.  That meeting took place on Mr Bonvino's recollection, on 24 October
1995.  On Mr Bonvino's evidence,
Mr Kull said:  "I am also unhappy with the
performance of Ed" and Mr Bonvino had said:
<P>

	<i>"Okay so we are all agreed, we have identified all the issues where Walters
is not performing and I will put these down in point form
as a result of this
meeting, and we will then hold directors' meetings at which it will be resolved
that Walters can continue with
his administration duties provided he observes
certain requirements which we have discussed today."</i>
<P>

154	Mr Bonvino did not notice any improvement in Mr Walters' performance after
the 24 October 1995 meeting and he arranged for a
young accountant to apply for
Mr Walters' job.  Both Mr Wright and Mr Walters rejected the accountant, Mr
Walters saying that the
accountant was not experienced or street-wise
enough.
<P>

155	In December 1995, at the monthly meeting in respect of the performance of
Cashflow for November, the following was said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Bonvino:   "Our fees have gone down.  There is a problem.  We have more
funds being worked but our fees have dropped.  How can
this happen.  I want you
to explain it to me."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:   "Tony, you have got no idea how these fees work and it is just
too hard to explain it to you."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino:   "Well I'm going to get to the bottom of this even if it kills
me."</i>
<P>

156	After that meeting, Mr Bonvino used the existing monthly summaries which he
held to reconstruct the fees which should have been
received by Cashflow, in
order to determine why the fees had dropped when the amount of funds advanced
had increased.  He noticed
that Trans-pac 1 had been incorrectly charged and
that an extra fee should have been payable by Trans-pac due to the ageing of
debtors
that had not been charged.  He noticed that Cashflow had been making
advances to Trans-pac 1 without receiving First Schedules from
Trans-pac 1 as
required under the factoring deed.  Mr Walters, he noticed, had apparently
adopted a practice of making the advance
to Trans-pac 1 without a First
Schedule and then waiting to the end of the month to determine the fee
structure.  This meant that
Trans-pac 1 received an interest free period of
time from the date of the advance to the end of the month.  When Mr Bonvino
asked
Mr Walters for a copy of the First Schedule in respect of a number of
advances to Trans-pac 1 Mr Walters replied:  "I don't have
them all.  I gave
them advances and tried to reconcile at the end of the month."
<P>

157	Subsequently, Mr Bonvino arranged meetings with Mr Wright and Mr Walters at
the Beverley Hills office.  A meeting was held before
Christmas 1995 at which
Mr Bonvino demonstrated to Mr Walters how he had failed to charge the fee
referred to above and after an
initial period of argument, Mr Walters admitted
that he had made a mistake and said he would fix it.  Mr Bonvino said that he
was
extremely concerned that the factoring deed had not been observed by
Cashflow.  He said that he did not agree to the advance of any
further funds to
Trans-pac without a First Schedule and a summary of all the debtors that
Cashflow was purchasing.  He said, inter
alia: 
<P>

	<i>"That way, the fee structure will be maintained.  Peter, it is your
responsibility to make sure this happens.  It is extremely important
and must
be observed.  We must have First Schedules and the appropriate fees charged to
the client.  I want your undertaking on that.
 I want you to bring this account
back into good order."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright said:  "Tony, we have got extra security and mortgages over the
property.  I accept your concern and I will make sure it
happens that way.
However, you should not be concerned because we hold approximately $600,000 in
security over homes of Trans-pac
directors and we wouldn't release this until
their account pay-out is received."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino said:  "I want the same undertaking from you Ed."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters said:  "Okay, from now on I will do it as you want."</i>
<P>

158	Mr Bonvino continued after that meeting to closely check the monthly
summaries presented at subsequent monthly meetings and
the fees were increasing
and he was satisfied.  He was not, however, satisfied with the total
accountability of the trial balance.
 The trial balance did not break up the
total advances made by Cashflow under factoring arrangements with different
clients but simply
presented a total figure.  He found the trial balance very
hard to reconcile because it was not possible to check off against individual
client ledgers, the amount which had been advanced by the company overall.  He
raised that matter at a meeting in January 1996 with
Mr Walters who then again
said that it was very difficult to produce a total reconciliation of the trial
balance as it all related
to ageing of the debtors and depended on what point
of the month one was in.
<P>

159	From time to time over the same period, Mr Bonvino raised with Mr Wright
the possibility of retaining a new accountant but Mr
Wright did not take up
that suggestion.  Mr Bonvino remained concerned because at the end of each
month from the information he was
given, he could not break up the factored
amounts into individual client loan accounts.  The computer software used by
Cashflow was
specially developed for factoring and Mr Bonvino did not
understand it.  Mr Walters avoided giving Mr Bonvino any explanation as
to the
workings of the software by telling him that it was far too complex and too
difficult and that he did not have time.  Mr Wright
also said to Mr Bonvino to
leave it alone as Mr Walters was too busy.  Mr Wright said that everything was
in order and that Mr Bonvino
did not need to worry.
<P>

160	Over the next few months, the same issues continued to be raised in the
monthly meetings, namely the fact that the trial balance
was not supplied with
the individual clients' loan account ledgers, Mr Walters' performance and
whether or not a new accountant should
be retained.  However, Mr Bonvino's
evidence was that the fees being generated by Trans-pac No. 1 improved.  At
every monthly meeting,
he was presented with monthly summaries by Mr Walters.
The monthly summaries showed all factoring clients of Cashflow, the position
of
their debtors, fees charged, security held and a pay-out figure.  Mr Bonvino
looked at the monthly summaries and saw nothing out
of order except that the
amount of retention for the Trans-pac account was outside the factoring deed.
He raised this with Mr Walters
and Mr Wright at the monthly meetings, Mr Wright
saying:  "Don't worry about it.  We hold $600,000 extra collateral by way of
second
mortgage, mortgages over Trans-pac's directors' homes.  When you take
that into account, we have more security than you ever need.
<P>

161	Mr Bonvino was shown a profit and loss statement and balance sheet for
Cashflow at each monthly meeting.  He examined the documents
as best he could
to understand them and to him, everything appeared to be in order.  Cashflow
was showing a profit every month. 
Mr Wright often said at the monthly meetings
when discussing financial statements, that they were making good money as Mr
Bonvino,
he said, should be able to see from the accounts.
<P>

162	From the discussions which Mr Bonvino had had with Mr Wright and Mr Walters
and the information provided to him at the monthly
meetings, he understood that
both Mr Wright and Mr Walters were stating that the accounts of Cashflow were
correct and that it was
making a profit.  He further understood that the
account in relation to Trans-pac 1 was correct as disclosed by the monthly
summaries.
 He gave evidence which I accept, that had he known the true
position in relation to the Trans-pac No 1 account, he would have taken
a
number of steps to prevent any further deterioration of the Trans-pac No 1
account.  Those would have included terminating Mr Walters'
employment
immediately, changing the authority with Westpac to include his signature for
all cheques written by Cashflow, appointing
a new accountant to report directly
to him and refraining from investing any further funds in Cashflow from
Pyrafount until the internal
control procedures of Cashflow were such as to
prevent any further loss and the extent of the liability of the Trans-pac
account
was known.
<P>

163	Mr Bonvino gave evidence that with the benefit of hindsight, had he been
aware on 30 June 1995, as to the deficit existing in
the Trans-pac account to
the extent of $140,000 he would not have approved the payment of dividends or
fees in respect of that financial
year.
<P>

164	On 30 June 1996, Mr Bonvino requested Mr Walters to provide him with a
year-end profit and loss and balance sheet in a form
which would be reconciled.
He sought a complete break-up of every client represented by all advances in
the balance sheet.  Mr Walters
`fobbed him off' by saying that he would try but
was busy.  That conversation was repeated many times but, as at 9 August 1996,
the
information had still not been provided.
<P>

165	After Mr Bonvino demanded a meeting, a meeting took place on 12 August
1996.  The events at the meeting have already been set
out.
<P>

166	Mr Bonvino naturally became extremely upset upon hearing the information
given at the meeting.  He understood that Mr Walters
was informing him that the
`profit' which had been declared at the end of the 30 June 1995 financial year,
should not have been declared
and that Cashflow may well have suffered a loss
depending on the collectability of the advances made to Trans-pac No 1.  He
said
to Mr Walters and Mr Wright words to the effect:  "I don't understand
this.  I gave you both strict instructions that you should
not advance
Trans-pac any funds without proper procedures being followed.  As far as I am
concerned, you are both accountable for
this.  You both have deceived me and I
am taking control of Cashflow to try and sort out this mess."
<P>

167	He said to Mr Walters:  "Show me every transaction which has occurred
between Cashflow and Trans-pac".
<P>

168	He selected Trans-pac No 1 because Mr Walters had said to him:  "All the
problems are in Trans-pac's account.
<P>

169	Over the next two weeks, Mr Bonvino attended at the Beverley Hills office
every day in any attempt to reconstruct the payments
and receipt ledger for
Trans-pac No. 1.  Mr Walters spent a great deal of time with him and showed Mr
Bonvino how he had falsified
the ledger.  Mr Walters had made fictitious
journal entries to make the ledger balance.  Annexed to Mr Bonvino's affidavit
of 27
April 1998 and marked `Z' is a copy of the general ledger trial balance
of Trans-pac from 31 August 1994 to 2 August 1996.  That
trial balance had been
extensively amended by hand.  Most of the amendments were made by Mr Walters in
Mr Bonvino's presence and
explained to him by Mr Walters during the two week
period to which I have referred.  Some of Mr Bonvino's comments were written by
him as explanatory notes of what the entry represented.
<P>

170	A number of entries have been ruled through with a line by Mr Walters.  At
that time, Mr Walters said:  "The entries I have
ruled through with a line are
all fictitious.  The reason I made them was to make it look as though we were
getting substantial receipts
to accommodate our payments.  In some cases, the
cheques that Wright and I wrote out to Trans-pac were deposited back into
Cashflow's
account so that it looked as though we were getting deposits".
<P>

171	In relation to the entry of $140,000 designated with the word `accrual'
showing a transaction date of 30 June 1995 and a posting
date of 3 October
1995, Mr Walters said to Mr Bonvino: 
<P>

	<i>"I did this to reduce Trans-pac's loan account so that it was in order.  If
I had not done it, it would have shown a deficiency of
$140,000."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino responded:  "So you mean that the amount that was actually
advanced to Trans-pac at 30 June 1995 was $906,125.22 not $766,125.22?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters said:  "Yes.</i>
<P>

172	Mr Bonvino wrote the word `dummy' alongside that entry, following that
explanation.
<P>

173	As a result of the discussion with Mr Walters, Mr Bonvino was able to
reconcile the amounts actually advanced to Trans-pac No
1 and the fees which
were generated by each such advance, together with the amounts actually
received by Cashflow in respect of the
Trans-pac No 1 account, less credit
notes raised.
<P>

174	With the assistance of the explanation given by Mr Walters, Mr Bonvino
reconstructed the Trans-pac No 1 account.  Annexed to
his affidavit and marked
`AA' is a copy of the general ledger reconstructed by him.
<P>

175	Mr Bonvino, in paragraphs 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 of his affidavit of 27
April 1998, gives further detail in relation to his
discussions with Mr Walters
in the following days.  I accept this evidence.  The evidence includes Mr
Bonvino ascertaining that there
were blank cheque butts and there were
anomalies and irregularities on many of the cheque butts of Cashflow and that
in some cases,
the notation on the cheque butt did not accord with the payee or
receipt of the relevant cheques.  Mr Bonvino also says, and I accept,
that he
asked Mr Walters how he was able to do this on his own.  He said to Mr Walters:

<P>

	<i>"Didn't Peter [referring to Mr Wright] sign the cheques?  Didn't he review
the First Schedules and didn't he know that this account
was out of
whack?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters responded:  "Tony, Peter just signed the cheques as I presented
them to him.  He never questioned the cheques and he was
usually not around in
the afternoon after lunch anyway, to check what I was doing.  He never looked
at source documents to verify
the authenticity of my cheques and he never
looked at the First Schedules."</i>
<P>

176	Mr Bonvino kept notifying Mr Wright of the matters which he had discovered
and told him that the cheque butts were blank and
contained anomalies.  He said
to Mr Wright:  
<P>

	<i>"Peter, you must have signed cheques where there was no proper paperwork.
Why did you do it?"</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright said:  "I don't know.  I guess we both made a mistake".</i>
<P>

177	Mr Bonvino also attended at the Beverley Hills branch of Westpac and spoke
with a female employee there and asked her what were
the procedures for
honouring a cheque when it was presented to the bank and she said:  "We get the
cheque, we look at the validity
of the cheque, we look at the signatures to
make sure they are okay and we make sure that it is going to the person that it
is written
to."
<P>

178	Mr Bonvino had been the sole signatory to Cashflow's cheque account and
requested and obtained from the bank employee to whom
he spoke, a copy of the
account operating authority for Cashflow.
<P>

179	At the same time as Mr Bonvino was learning of these circumstances relating
to Cashflow, he invited Mr Duffield, a solicitor
who represented Cashflow, to
attend the premises and advise on the situation.  Mr Duffield carried out
searches on Trans-pac No 1
and the titles over which Cashflow held securities.
Those searches disclosed that both second mortgages over the two Strathfield
properties, being the residential homes of the directors of Trans-pac No 1,
were discharged.
<P>

180	Mr Duffield also ascertained that the National Australia Bank which had
taken the place of the previous first mortgagee under
a refinancing, had
increased the borrowing made under the first mortgage by the sum of $250,000.
Cashflow thus no longer had a second
mortgage securing it's debt over those
properties.
<P>

181	As a result of what Mr Duffield learned, Mr Bonvino realised that the
mortgages had been discharged and that Cashflow had received
no payment from
Trans-pac.  The debt from Trans-pac had increased and not reduced.  A meeting
then took place at which the following
was said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Bonvino:  "How did you allow this to happen [referring to Mr Wright and
Mr Walters]?</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:  "I can't remember that happening.  Maybe I did but I don't know
for sure.  It looks like my signature but I can't be sure."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Walters:  "I can't answer.  I've been to see my solicitor and he said I
can't answer."</i>
<P>

182	During Mr Bonvino's inspection of cheques retrieved from Westpac, he found
that a number of cheques drawn on Cashflow's account
and presented for payment
and honoured had only the signature of Mr Walters on the cheques.
<P>

183	Mr Bonvino was not ever contacted by Westpac about any cheque drawn by
Cashflow that was presented for payment and had only
one signature, nor was he
contacted by Westpac about any cheque drawn by Cashflow in favour of a party,
but banked to the account
of another entity.  Nor was he contacted by Westpac
about any cheque drawn by Cashflow in favour of Trans-pac No 1 which
subsequently
was banked to the account of Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited or
any other account.
<P>

184	At some stage during this same period, Mr Bonvino became aware that cheques
written by Cashflow to Trans-pac Container Freight
Services Pty Limited had in
fact been received and banked by Trans-pac No 2.
<P>

185	The face value of the cheques drawn by Cashflow in favour of Trans-pac
after 1 December 1995 was $1,677,098.  The balance of
the account at 31 March
1998, including fees and receipts, was $2,560,134.84.
<P>

186	Mr Bonvino's evidence, which I accept, was that Cashflow had no factoring
arrangements in place with Trans-pac No 2.  He was
indeed unaware of the
existence of Trans-pac No 2 until August 1996.
<P>

187	Mr Bonvino's affidavit of 27 April 1998 then went into very specific detail
on the irregularities which he uncovered during
this time and in the course of
discovery and inspection of documents.  That evidence is accepted.  It is
unnecessary to go into that
detail for present purposes although later in the
Judgment a number of specifics are in fact referred to.
<P>

188	In about late August 1996 or soon thereafter, Mr Bonvino had a meeting with
Mr Peter Panayi from Trans-pac No 1 in Leichhardt.
 Mr Wright was invited to
attend but did not do so.  At the meeting, words to the following effect were
said:
<P>

	<i>Mr Bonvino:  "Peter [referring to Peter Panayi], I believe you owe us a lot
of money.  I'd like you to explain how this whole fiasco
occurred."</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Panayi:  "I know there is a lot of money owed to Cashflow and the exact
amount is unclear because of the lack of proper paperwork
from Ed Walters and
Peter Wright.  There are two sides to this story and it is not totally our
fault.  Walters and Wright are both
as much to blame as we are.  We can't make
good all the amounts.  We may as well just close up shop and give up, but what
I can guarantee
you is that we will endeavour to pay about half the amount
commencing with a certain amount and scaling up.  You should ask Wright
and
Walters for the other half as they knew what was happening.  You will find they
received a benefit out of this."</i>
<P>

189	Mr Bonvino gave evidence that he was unaware of any advances from CODFA to
Cashflow at the time.  To his knowledge, Mr Walters
and Mr Wright were aware
that Pyrafount, the major funder of Cashflow, had additional funds to inject
from time to time if necessary.
 His evidence was that it would have been
possible for Pyrafount No 3 to have injected further capital in the order of
$500,000 into
Cashflow had this been sought.
<P>

	<b>The Proceedings</b>
<P>

<b>	50177 of 1997 - The Main Proceedings</b>
<P>

190	Sufficient of the Court's findings as to the facts have now been outlined,
to indicate the nature of the difficulties exposed
by the conduct of Mr Walters
and Mr Wright which have led to the institution of these several sets of
proceedings.  Shortly stated,
the proceedings concern the flow of moneys from
CODFA to Cashflow and from Cashflow made ostensibly to clients of Cashflow.
The flow
of moneys can be located in two places.  The first is in Schedules 1
and 2 to the amended statement of claim in the central set of
proceedings 50177
of 1997.  Schedule 1 records payments from CODFA's accounts to Cashflow or to
Cashflow's clients.  CODFA's pleading
describes these payments as `the paid
funds'.  The Judgment adopts the same shorthand description.  Schedule 2
records payments from
Cashflow to CODFA's accounts.  It is convenient to refer
to these payments as `the received funds'.  The schedules are appended to
the
Judgment as Appendix 2.
<P>

191	The second place where the flow of moneys can be located is a document now
annotated by Cashflow, but originally being Schedule
A to Exhibit GMG4 to the
statement of Mr Graeme Matthew Green of 27 March 1998.  In its original form
the schedule lists out each
entry (in date order) together with a brief typed
narration.  As annotated by Cashflow in handwriting and with connecting lines,
the schedule identifies the running balance of amounts owing by Cashflow to
CODFA if all the transactions are binding.  The connecting
lines point up
matching items said to be `repayments'.  This document is appended to the
Judgment as Appendix 3.  It is referred
to, for convenience, as `GMG4';
although it is, of course, an annotated version of that document.
<P>

192	The parties to proceedings 50177 of 1997 are CODFA as plaintiff, Cashflow
as first defendant, Mr Peter Wright as second defendant,
Factors as third
defendant, Mr Walters as fourth defendant and Mrs Walters as fifth defendant.
the cross-defendants to Cashflow's
cross-claim filed on 18 March 1999 are CODFA
as first cross-defendant, Mr Wright as second cross-defendant, Mr Walters as
third cross-defendant,
Mrs Walters as also a third cross-defendant and Factors
as fourth cross-defendant.  These proceedings insofar as they involved Mrs
Walters either as a defendant or as a cross-defendant have been settled.
<P>

	<b>50111 of 1997 - The Westpac Proceedings</b>
<P>

193	Proceedings 50111 of 1997 were instituted by Cashflow against Westpac
Banking Corporation [`Westpac'] as first defendant and
originally against St
George Bank Limited [`St George Bank'] as second defendant.  St George Bank
filed a cross-claim.  St George
Bank dropped out of the proceedings at an early
stage, on my understanding discontinuing its own cross-claim at a time when
Cashflow
determined to no longer proceed against it.
<P>

194	A second cross-claim was filed by Westpac joining as cross-defendants Mr
Walters, Mr Wright, St George Bank Limited, CODFA,
Mr Burkett and Mrs Burkett.
A third cross-claim had been filed by CODFA joining as cross-defendants Mr
Wright, Factors, Mr Walters,
Mrs Walters and Westpac.  Proceedings 50111 of
1997 have been settled save possibly for some questions as to costs which will
be
able to be dealt with at the same time as short minutes are finally brought
in.  Westpac's payment to Cashflow will be available
to the liquidator in the
regular administration of the liquidation.
<P>

	<b>50114 of 1998 - Trans-pac Proceedings</b>
<P>

195	Proceedings 50114 of 1998 were brought by CODFA as plaintiff against Mr
Walters, Mrs Walters and Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited
[`Transpac No 2] as
defendants.  Insofar as involving Mrs Walters, these proceedings were settled.
The proceedings concern a cheque
drawn by Mr Walters on or about 24 May 1996
made payable to Trans-pac or bearer in the sum of $49,626 on CODFA's account.
The proceedings
concern also the withdrawal between June 1996 and August 1996
by Mr Walters by operation on CODFA's account of sums in the total
of $396,498
made payable to Trans-pac.  Those funds were withdrawn on 12 June 1996 as to
$52,316;  on 20 June 1996 as to $52,361;
 on 11 July 1996 as to $75,286;  on 16
July 1996 as to $47,671;  as to $56,231 on 18 July 1996;  as to $66,316 on 31
July 1996 and
as to $46,317 on 1 August 1996.  Those funds were deposited by
electronic transfer directly into the bank account of Trans-pac.
<P>

196	The pleading alleges that no proper authorisation by CODFA existed for the
drawing and delivery of the cheques or the withdrawal
of the funds, as the
withdrawals are said not to have been authorised by the directors of CODFA.  It
is also alleged that there was
no commercial purpose for the withdrawal of
those sums.  The pleading alleges that at all material times, Mr Wright was the
managing
director of CODFA and was a co-signatory of CODFA's account, operated
with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at its Beverley Hills
Branch.  The
pleading alleges the partnership at all material times between Mr and Mrs
Walters as Walters &amp; Associates.  The
allegation is that Mr Walters was at
all material times the secretary of CODFA and a co-signatory of the CODFA
account to which I
have referred.  The allegation is that at all material times
CODFA was the owner of the funds in the CODFA's account.  There is then
pleaded
an Accountancy and Services Agreement in force as at and after May 1996 between
Mr and Mrs Walters jointly trading as Walters
&amp; Associates of the one part
and CODFA of the other part, whereunder Mr and Mrs Walters are said to have
agreed with CODFA for
Mr and Mrs Walters to provide to CODFA services in the
nature of accounting, banking, administrative and secretarial services in
consideration for CODFA paying a fee to them.  The same agreement is pleaded in
proceedings 50177 of 1997 and findings in relation
to the agreement are set out
below.  The particulars given are not in precisely the same terms but no
material difference is made
out.  The agreement was made on or about 1 August
1991.  The particulars of the agreement are given as Clause 18 of the Joint
Venture
Agreement, later varied, and as conversations between Mr Walters on
behalf of himself and Mrs Walters and by Mr Wright on behalf
of CODFA of about
August 1991.  The agreement is also said to be implied in part from the fact
that on and after May 1996 until August
1996, Mr Walters worked at the premises
for CODFA performing accounting, banking and administrative work;  that on and
after May
1996 Mrs Walters worked at the premises for CODFA performing
secretarial work and otherwise assisting Mr Walters in administrative
tasks for
the accounting, banking and administrative work performed by Mr Walters;  that
Mr and Mrs Walters rendered to CODFA invoices
in the name of Walters &amp;
Associates for the accounting and secretarial work performed for CODFA and that
CODFA delivered to Mr
Walters cheques in the name of Walters &amp; Associates
in payment for the invoices rendered.
<P>

197	The Accounting and Services Agreement is said to have contained terms that
Mr and Mrs Walters jointly and severally would provide
to CODFA services,
including processing payments made to CODFA and depositing cheques and other
receipts to CODFA's accounts and
preparing cheques for co-signature drawn on
CODFA's accounts properly payable in accordance with CODFA's authorised
business.
<P>

198	Further terms pleaded are that Mr Walters would sign and present to Mr
Wright for signing only cheques which were payable on
behalf of CODFA in
accordance with CODFA's authorised business and that the services provided by
Mr and Mrs Walters would be provided
honestly and with reasonable care and
diligence.
<P>

199	There is also pleaded an arrangement existing from May 1996 between Peter
Wright and Mr Walters in his capacity as secretary
of CODFA and under the
Accounting and Services Agreement, whereunder Mr Wright, subject to an
overriding supervisory role, delegated
to Mr Walters the day to day handling of
the management tasks which are referred to in the pleading as the `Management
Arrangement'.
 That arrangement is said to have been made in or about August
1991 in conversations between Mr Wright and Mr Walters.
<P>

200	CODFA pleads that as secretary of CODFA and/or pursuant to the Accounting
and Services Agreement and/or pursuant to the Management
Arrangement, Mr
Walters at all material times in fact had the day to day handling of management
tasks under the supervision of Mr
Wright, requiring him to ensure that funds
advanced and funds received to and from clients, were made in accordance with
factoring
agreements and to ensure that loans or other transfers of money to
and from companies of which Mr Wright was a director or in which
he held some
interest or which were not factoring clients of CODFA were scrutinised and paid
or received for a proper commercial
purpose.
<P>

201	CODFA also relies upon Mr Walters as having been an officer of CODFA within
the meaning of section 231 of the Corporations Law,
who was under the
Accounting and Services Agreement and under the Management Arrangement and in
tort, a person who owed a duty of
care to CODFA for the acts or himself and Mrs
Walters;  who as secretary of CODFA owed a fiduciary obligation and duty of
care to
CODFA and who, as an officer of CODFA, had statutory duties to CODFA
pursuant to section 232 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

202	Again, as the proceedings have been settled in relation to Mrs Walters, it
is not necessary to outline the particular allegations
which had been made
against her before the settlement.
<P>

203	The pleading details the cheques and drawings referred to above.  The 24
May 1996 cheque is said to have been delivered by Mr
Walters to Trans-pac which
is said to have presented the cheque for deposit into the bank of Trans-pac.
The pleading alleges that
the cheque was honoured and the proceeds of the
cheque was received by Trans-pac.
<P>

204	The pleading alleges that Mr Walters breached the terms of the Accounting
and Services Agreement and the duties earlier referred
to in making advances of
the funds other than in accordance with CODFA's authorised factoring agreements
or other authorised business;
 in preparing, signing and forging the signature
of Mr Wright on the cheque on behalf of CODFA, that was not properly payable to
the named payee and otherwise not drawn and presented in accordance with
CODFA's authorised business or alternatively in preparing,
signing or
presenting to Mr Wright for signing the cheque on behalf of CODFA that was not
properly payable to the named payee and
otherwise not drawn and presented in
accordance with CODFA's authorised business.  Further breaches include the
allegation that Mr
Walters failed to act in a diligent, honest and careful
capacity in accordance with his duties as earlier alleged and set out above.
<P>

205	The pleading alleges that the cheque and funds were received by Trans-pac
No 2 as a volunteer without any consideration being
given for the proceeds and
that further or in the alternative, the cheque and funds were received by
Trans-pac No 2 with knowledge
of the fact that they were the property of CODFA
and that the payment of the cheque and funds to Trans-pac No2's account was
without
consideration or any other commercial purpose or benefit.
<P>

206	The pleading then alleges that in the premises, the proceeds of the cheque
and funds are property held by Trans-pac No 2 in
trust for CODFA - the proceeds
and funds being defined in the pleading as `the Trans-pac proceeds'.
<P>

207	CODFA asserts that it has demanded payment of the Trans-pac proceeds by
Trans-pac No 2 but that Trans-pac No 2 has failed to
repay those proceeds.
<P>

208	CODFA alleges that it has demanded repayment of the Trans-pac proceeds by
Mr Walters and accepts that on 20 November 1997 Mr
Walters repaid to CODFA the
amount of $99,561 in reduction of the Trans-pac proceeds.  The pleading asserts
that he has failed to
repay any further part of the Trans-pac proceeds.
<P>

209	CODFA asserts that as a result of the breaches by Mr Walters of the terms
of the Accounting and Services Agreement and the duties
earlier referred to,
CODFA suffered loss by loss of the Trans-pac proceeds and by the opportunity to
earn profit on the Trans-pac
proceeds and claims that Mr Walters is liable to
pay to CODFA compensation including damages for the loss suffered.  That
liability
is said to arise from the general law and/or from section 1317HD
Corporations Law.
<P>

210	In the result, the claims to relief by CODFA ultimately pressed in proposed
Short Minutes of Order furnished at the end of the
hearing are as follows:
<P>

	(1)	Order that Mr Walters pay to CODFA the sum of $346,653 ($446,124 minus
$99,561 repaid by Mr Walters) (with interest from 1
August 1996 to 20 November
1997 calculated on the sum of $446,124 and interest thereafter calculated on
the sum of $346,653), as
compensation and/or damages for losses suffered by
CODFA.
<P>

(2)	An order that Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited pay CODFA the sum of $446,124
with interest from 9 August 1996.
<P>

(3)	Liberty to be reserved to CODFA to claim an equitable interest in such, if
any, property as may come into the hands of the liquidator
of Trans-pac
Australia Limited.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>50047 of 1998 - The Avoidance Proceedings</b>
<P>

211	The final set of proceedings 50047 of 1998 were brought by Mr Star, being
the liquidator of Cashflow, as plaintiff against Kylon
as first defendant and
against CODFA as second defendant.  CODFA in turn pursues a cross-claim against
Cashflow as first cross-defendant
and against Mr Star as second
cross-defendant.
<P>

212	Mr Star's claim is that CODFA received the benefit of various uncommercial
and insolvent transactions and that Kylon also benefited
from the said
transactions within the meaning of section 588FF(1)(c) of the Corporations Law.
Hence, these are the proceedings in
which the issue is whether the defendants
received a benefit from insolvent and uncommercial transactions within the
meaning of section
588FF(1)(c) Corporations Law.
<P>

213	The plaintiff alleges that Mr Wright was the managing director of Cashflow;
that Mr Wright was the managing director of Factors;
 that Mr and Mrs Walters
trading as Walters &amp; Associates provided accounting services to Cashflow
and that Mr Walters was an
authorised signatory to the account and a secretary
of Cashflow and CODFA;  that an Office Services Agreement between CODFA and
Cashflow
referred to below was entered into.
<P>

214	Mr Star contends that Kylon owns one-half of the issued capital of CODFA
and is the first registered charge holder over the
assets and undertakings of
CODFA and that Mr Wright and Mr Walters were officers of Cashflow within the
meaning of section 232 of
the law.  Cashflow is said to have been placed in
liquidation on 19 December 1996.  Mr Star alleges that by virtue of section 9
and
Division 1A of Part 5.6 of the Corporations Law, the relation back day of
and concerning Cashflow is 12 September 1996.
<P>

215	The plaintiff claims that Mr Wright as managing director of Cashflow and Mr
Walters as company secretary of Cashflow and also
on behalf of Walters &amp;
Associates, failed to keep and maintain accounting records of Cashflow in
accordance with section 289
of the Corporations Law.
<P>

216	The pleading is then that by reason of section 588E(3) and (4) of the
Corporations Law, Cashflow was insolvent during the 12
month period ending on
the relation back day.  That period is defined as `the relevant period'.  In
the alternative, the plaintiff
claims that Cashflow was insolvent during the
relevant period in fact.
<P>

217	The pleading asserts that in the six-month period ending on the relation
back day, Cashflow and Factors and CODFA, entered into
a number of transactions
pursuant to which Cashflow paid to CODFA $498,506.  These transactions are said
to have been unfair preferences
given by Cashflow to CODFA because they were
each parties to the transactions which resulted in CODFA receiving from
Cashflow in
respect of unsecured debts that Cashflow owed to CODFA, more than
CODFA would receive from Cashflow in respect of the debts, if the
transactions
were set aside and CODFA required to prove for the debts in the winding up of
Cashflow.
<P>

218	The pleading then asserts that the unfair preferences are by reason of
section 588FC Corporations Law also insolvent transactions
and that by reason
of section 588FE 2(2)(a) and (b) of the law, the insolvent transactions are
avoidable.
<P>

219	The pleading alleges that CODFA benefited from the insolvent transactions
and is liable under section 588FF of the law to repay
the same.
<P>

220	An alternative pleading is that during the relevant period Cashflow entered
into a number of transactions pursuant to which:
<P>

	(a)	Cashflow paid $772,172 to CODFA;
<P>

(b)	Cashflow paid the additional sum of $23,140 or alternatively $15,630 to
CODFA being an office services fee paid in the 12-months
preceding 12 September
1996 (or alternatively from 1 December 1995 to 12 September 1996).
<P>

221	These transactions are said to have been uncommercial transactions of
Cashflow, it being asserted that a reasonable person in
Cashflow's
circumstances would not have entered into the said transactions having regard
to the benefits to Cashflow of doing so,
the detriment to Cashflow of doing so
and other relevant matters.
<P>

222	Cashflow is said to have been insolvent at the time those transactions took
place.
<P>

223	The uncommercial transactions are also said to have been insolvent
transactions by reason of section 588FC of the law.  The
uncommercial
transactions are also said to have been voidable by reason of section 588FE(3)
of the law.
<P>

224	The pleading alleges that CODFA derived a benefit from the uncommercial
transactions and is liable to repay the same pursuant
to section 588FF of the
law.
<P>

225	The plaintiff claims damages, interest, an order that the subject
transactions be avoided as between Cashflow and CODFA, an
order that CODFA pay
to Mr Star the amounts of $498,506 and $772,172 pursuant to section 588FF(1) of
the Corporations Law.  A further
claim is made to an order that CODFA pay to Mr
Star the amounts of $23,140 (or alternatively $14,630) pursuant to section
588FF(1)
of the Corporations Law).
<P>

	<b>CODFA's `Office Services' Cross Claim</b>
<P>

226	CODFA's cross-claim against Cashflow and against Mr Star relates to the
alleged use by Cashflow of office premises and services
paid for by CODFA.
CODFA pleads that it carried on business from the Beverley Hills premises as
did Cashflow.  The pleading is that
at all material times CODFA paid all rent,
advertising, cleaning, light, electricity, printing, stationery, telephone and
motor vehicle
expenses associated with the office premises and business
conducted by both companies.  These are defined as `office services'.
<P>

227	The pleading alleges that by an agreement existing as at and from 1 July
1996 made between CODFA and Cashflow, in consideration
of Cashflow being
permitted to operate its business from the premises and have use of the
premises and office services, Cashflow
was to pay CODFA a contribution fee,
being a proportion of the expense for the office services, such proportion
being the same percentage
as the factoring fees earned by Cashflow from the
operation of its business bore to the factoring fees earned by Cashflow and
CODFA
(`contribution fee').
<P>

228	The agreement is said to have been express and oral and made between Mr
Kull of CODFA and Mr Wright of Cashflow in a conversation
in about July 1996 [I
take the references to 1994 to be typographic errors].  The agreement is said
to have been later varied in
late 1996, again in a conversation between Mr Kull
of CODFA and this time Mr Bonvino for Cashflow - to include payment of Mr
Wright's
motor vehicle expenses associated with his work for CODFA and
Cashflow.
<P>

229	The pleading alleges that between 1 July 1996 and 11 September 1996,
Cashflow continued to operate its business from the premises
and to use the
premises and office services but in breach of the agreement, had not paid any
contribution fee to CODFA.  Detailed
particulars of the contribution fee by way
of calculations are set out in the pleadings.  It is then alleged that by an
agreement
made on or about 16 December 1996 between CODFA and Mr Star, it was
agreed that in consideration of Mr Star being permitted to use
the premises and
office services from the date of his appointment as provisional liquidator, Mr
Star would pay $250 per week to CODFA.
 Particulars of that agreement are set
out in letters from CODFA to Mr Star of 16 December 1996 and a response from Mr
Star to CODFA
of 16 December 1996.
<P>

230	The pleading alleges a breach of that agreement and as a result of those
breaches, CODFA claims to have suffered loss.
<P>

231	In the proposed Short Minutes of Order furnished to the Court at the end of
the hearing, CODFA pressed claims to relief on it's
cross claim as follows:
<P>

	<i>(1)	Order that John Edward Star or alternatively Cashflow pay CODFA the sum
of $6,050 with interest from 28 February 1997.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	Order that the liability of Mr Star for the sum of $6,050 and interest
thereon be deemed an expense within the meaning of section
556(1)(a) of the
Corporations Law for the purposes of the winding up of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	Order that Cashflow pay CODFA the sum of $4,344.68 with interest from 12
September 1997.</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	Order that the liability to account of Cashflow and Mr Star to CODFA
should be set off against the liability, if any, of CODFA
to pay moneys to Mr
Star or Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(5)	Order that Cashflow and Mr Star hold on trust or subject to orders for
equitable security, properties sufficient to meet the liability
of Cashflow or
Mr Star to CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Trans-pac Companies</b>
<P>

232	As will already be appreciated, a complication arises in relation to the
company referred to during the hearing as Trans-pac
No. 1, although it had
several names.  It is now in liquidation.  It was registered on 30 December
1993 as Trans-pac Container Freight
Services Pty Limited and in February 1996
changed its name to Strathfield Information Processing Bureau Pty Limited.  One
of the
issues in the proceedings was the date when it did cease to trade.  On
my findings it ceased to trade in about November 1995.  Detailed
reasons for
this finding are given below.
<P>

233	Upon the ceasing to trade of Trans-pac 1, the company referred to during
the proceedings as `Trans-pac 2', had been incorporated
and it effectively
appears to have stepped into the shoes of Trans-pac 1 for all relevant
purposes.  Trans-pac 2 is also now in liquidation.
 On 13 October 1995
Trans-pac 2 (formerly a shelf company) adopted the name `Trans-pac Australia
Pty Ltd'.  It commenced to trade
in about November 1995.  Its principal place
of business was the same as that of Trans-pac No. 1.  Peter and Terry Panayi
were appointed
as directors on 9 October 1995.
<P>

234	The complication to which I have referred, is that funds were paid from
time to time from Cashflow into Trans-pac 2, which had
no form of factoring
contract or formal arrangement with Cashflow.  Trans-pac No 1 on the other
hand, did have a formal factoring
agreement with Cashflow.
<P>

	<b>Balance of Account between CODFA and Cashflow</b>
<P>

235	The case also concerns a number of other movements of funds.  In some
cases, CODFA's funds were paid directly to solvent clients
of Cashflow.
CODFA's funds were also paid by cheque made payable to Trans-pac No. 1 but
deposited into Trans-pac No. 2's bank account.
 And at a material point in
time, Cashflow paid a number of cheques back to CODFA.  This occurred after Mr
Walters apparently became
apprehensive that his conduct in paying CODFA moneys
into the Cashflow bank account was about to become known and in an attempt,
apparently, to repay certain of the moneys.
<P>

236	The principal issues which separate CODFA and Cashflow flow from the
appointment of a liquidator to Cashflow on 19 December
1996, following an
application filed on 12 September 1996.  That circumstance has involved
Cashflow pressing claims against CODFA
to have repaid to Cashflow, moneys paid
by Cashflow to CODFA during the six month period leading to 12 September 1996.
These payments
are attacked as unfair preferences [Section 588FA Corporations
Law]  [See para 217 above]  At the same time, Cashflow pursues CODFA
in respect
of moneys paid by Cashflow to CODFA during the 12-months leading to 12
September 1996.  These payments are attacked as
being uncommercial transactions
[section 588 FB Corporations Law;  See paragraphs 220-224 above].  There is
thus a two pronged attack
upon payments made during the six month period
leading to 12 September 1996.
<P>

237	CODFA, understandably, has a violent objection to repayment of any of the
moneys which it received from Cashflow during the
12-month period prior to 12
September 1996.  It's stance is that these funds were `stolen' from it and
either banked into Cashflow's
bank account or paid to Cashflow's clients, and
that for Cashflow to now claim these funds back using the Corporations Law
`preference'
provisions or `uncommercial transaction' provisions constitutes
unconscionable conduct.  CODFA does not accept that the payments
fall within
the reach of the preference or uncommercial transactions provisions.
Alternatively, CODFA seeks to sidestep the operations
of the insolvency
provisions in a number of ways.  If Cashflow be successful in its claim by
invoking these provisions to have repaid
funds paid by it to CODFA during the
12-month period leading to 12 September 1996, CODFA pursues a claim to a
constructive trust
over those same funds, submitting that at the very moment
that the Court would order these funds to be repaid to Cashflow, a constructive
trust should be imposed for CODFA's benefit over such moneys.  CODFA also
claims that a constructive trust should be imposed in respect
of the net
balance alleged to be owing to it following the inter company payments,
notwithstanding that it is not possible for CODFA
to trace it's funds into
moneys now held by Cashflow's liquidator.
<P>

238	The further dispute between CODFA and Cashflow concerns what is the balance
of account between CODFA and Cashflow in terms of
the transfers of funds from
CODFA to Cashflow and then back again.  This dispute is ultimately one of
categorising particular payments,
most underlying objective facts ultimately
being agreed to, for obvious reasons.
<P>

239	A number of causes of action are pursued by CODFA against Cashflow and are
pursued by Cashflow against CODFA by cross-claim
in proceedings 50177 of
1997.
<P>

240	Before going to the detailed issues which are pleaded and which separate
CODFA and Cashflow, it is convenient to outline the
claims made against the
other parties, several of whom have already been mentioned.
<P>

241	In CODFA's outline submissions at the commencement of the hearing, it
summarised its principal claims for relief in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>`(a)	A claim against Cashflow for misappropriated or stolen funds in the
sum of $180,000 held on a constructive trust or alternatively
to be paid on
restitutionary principles.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	A claim against Cashflow and Star for recovery of "office expenses" in
the sum of $4,344.68 and $6,050.00 respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	A claim against Trans-pac No. 2 for misappropriated or stolen funds in
the sum of $396,498 held on a constructive trust or alternatively
to be paid on
restitutionary principles.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Claims against Wright, Factors, Mr Walters and Mrs Walters for breaches
of obligations owed which resulted in the loss of funds
claimed above.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Responsive claims against Wright, Factors, Mr and Mrs Walters for any
judgment for moneys (if any) which are found to be due by
CODFA to Cashflow or
Westpac.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[As earlier indicated, the proceedings against Mrs Walters were
settled.]
<P>

<i>	</i><b>CODFA's Claims in Proceedings 50177 of 1997 against Parties other
than Cashflow</b>
<P>

242	CODFA, in its second amended statement of claim filed on 22 March 1999 in
proceedings 50177 of 1997, claims that Mr Walters
and Mrs Walters carried on
business in a partnership trading as Walters &amp; Associates and that at all
material times Mr Walters
was secretary of CODFA, secretary of Cashflow and a
co-signatory of CODFA's accounts, operated with the St George Bank, the
Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, and in respect of an overdraft facility with
the CBA, held in the name of Mr &amp; Mrs Burkett.
<P>

	<b>The CODFA Management Agreement</b>
<P>

243	CODFA pleads that an agreement was in force as at and after November 1994
between Factors and CODFA (`the CODFA Management Agreement'
or `the Management
Agreement') whereunder Factors agreed with CODFA that Factors would provide the
managerial services of Mr Wright
to CODFA in consideration for CODFA paying a
management fee to Factors.
<P>

244	It is then said to have been a term of the CODFA Management Agreement that
the services would be provided honestly and with
reasonable care and diligence.

<P>

	<b>The CODFA Accountancy and Services Agreement</b>
<P>

245	CODFA then pleads that by an agreement in force at and after November 1994
between Mr Walters and Mrs Walters jointly trading
as Walters &amp; Associates
of the one part, and CODFA of the other part, (`the CODFA Accounting and
Services Agreement' or `the
Accounting and Services Agreement'), Mr Walters and
Mrs Walters agreed with CODFA for Mr Walters and Mrs Walters to provide to
CODFA,
services in the nature of accounting, banking, administrative and
secretarial services in consideration for CODFA paying a fee to
Mr and Mrs
Walters, trading as Walters &amp; Associates.
<P>

246	CODFA then pleads that it was a term of the CODFA Accounting and Services
Agreement enforceable against Mr and Mrs Walters jointly
and severally, that Mr
and Mrs Walters jointly and severally would provide to CODFA services,
including processing payments made
to CODFA and depositing cheques and other
receipts to CODFA's accounts, and preparing cheques for co-signature drawn on
CODFA's accounts
properly payable in accordance with CODFA's authorised
business.
<P>

247	CODFA also pleads that further terms of the Accounting and Services
Agreement enforceable against Mr and Mrs Walters generally
and severally, were
that Mr Walters would sign and present to Mr Wright for signing, only cheques
which were payable on behalf of
CODFA in accordance with CODFA's authorised
business, and that the services provided by Mr Walters and Mrs Walters would be
provided
honestly and with reasonable care and diligence.
<P>

248	CODFA then pleads that Mr Wright in his capacity as managing director of
CODFA and/or under the Management Agreement, was responsible
for examining and
approving factoring proposals that were submitted to CODFA, and for ensuring
that funds advanced and funds received
to and from clients were made in
accordance with factoring agreements.
<P>

249	CODFA then pleads that by an arrangement existing as at and from November
1994, between Mr Wright and Mr Walters, in his capacity
as secretary of CODFA
and under the Accounting and Services Agreement, Mr Wright, subject to an
overriding supervisory role, delegated
to Mr Walters the day to day handling of
the management tasks required under the Management Agreement.
<P>

250	CODFA then pleads that as managing director of CODFA and/or pursuant to the
Management Agreement, Mr Wright was at all material
times responsible for
supervising the daily management and affairs of CODFA.
<P>

251	CODFA pleads that as secretary of CODFA and/or pursuant to the Accounting
and Services Agreement and/or pursuant to the Management
Agreement, Mr Walters
at all material times in fact had the day to day handling of the management
tasks required by that Management
Agreement under the supervision of Mr
Wright.
<P>

252	CODFA then pleads the relevant duties of respectively Mr Wright, Factors,
Mr Walters and Mrs Walters.
<P>

253	CODFA pleads that at all material times Mr Walters and Mr Wright were
officers of CODFA within the meaning of section 231 of
the Corporations Law.
<P>

254	It is convenient to next detail the specific claims pursued by CODFA.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Claims Against Mr Wright</b>
<P>

255	CODFA pleads that in the premises, Mr Wright at all material times:
<P>

	(a)	under the CODFA Management Agreement and/or under the Management
Arrangement, owed a duty of care to CODFA;
<P>

(b)	as managing director of CODFA, owed a fiduciary obligation and a duty of
care to CODFA;  and
<P>

(c)	as an officer of CODFA, had statutory duties to CODFA pursuant to section
232 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

256	CODFA's claims against Mr Wright are that Mr Wright breached the duties
under the CODFA Management Agreement and breached the
fiduciary obligations,
duty of care and the statutory duties owed pursuant to section 232 of the
Corporations Law as earlier set
out.  Particulars of the breaches are given and
these include Mr Wright's having failed to ensure that CODFA made advances only
in
accordance with its authorised factoring agreements or other authorised
business;  Mr Wright signing cheques carelessly without ensuring
that the
cheques were properly payable to the named payee and otherwise drawn and
presented in accordance with CODFA's authorised
business dealings;  failure to
monitor, supervise and check that Mr Walters was acting in a diligent, honest
and careful capacity
in accordance with his duties;  was acting in accordance
with the Accounting and Service Agreement;  was acting in accordance with
the
Management Agreement;  was acting in accordance with the authorised factoring
business of CODFA;  was drawing, signing and/or
presenting cheques only in
accordance with the authorised operation of CODFA's account;  and was only
processing and causing to be
deposited in CODFA's accounts, cheques or other
funds properly receivable in accordance with CODFA's authorised business.
<P>

257	Mr Wright is also said to have breached the same duties by failing to
ensure that CODFA had a proper system of controls, audit
and/or review in its
business to avoid any unauthorised conduct by officers or employees such as
Walters.
<P>

258	CODFA pleads that as a result of the breaches by Mr Wright, alleged in the
statement of claim, CODFA has suffered loss by being
deprived of the
$1,240,641.00 `paid funds', and the opportunity to earn profit on the paid
funds.  The pleading is that Mr Wright
is liable to pay CODFA compensation
including damages for the loss suffered, which liability is said to arise from
the general law
and/or section 1317HD of the Corporations Law.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Claims against Factors</b>
<P>

259	CODFA pleads that in the premises, Factors at all material times under the
CODFA Management Agreement, owed a duty of care to
CODFA to ensure that the
provision by Factors of services performed by Mr Wright would be provided with
reasonable care and diligence.
<P>

260	CODFA pursues its claims against Factors by alleging that Factors breached
the term of the CODFA Management Agreement that the
services would be provided
honestly and with reasonable care and diligence.  The pleading is also that
Factors is in breach of its
duty of care under the CODFA Management Agreement
to ensure that the provision by Factors of services performed by Wright would
be
provided with reasonable care and diligence.
<P>

261	CODFA pleads that as a result of such breaches by Factors, CODFA has
suffered loss in that it has been deprived of the paid
funds and the
opportunity to earn profit on the paid funds.  The claim against Factors is
that it is liable to pay to CODFA damages
for the loss suffered.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Claims against Mr Walters</b>
<P>

262	CODFA then pleads that in the premises, Mr Walters at all material
times:
<P>

	(a)	under the CODFA Accounting and Services Agreement, under the Management
Arrangement and in tort, owed a duty of care to CODFA
for the acts of himself
and Mrs Walters;
<P>

(b)	as secretary of CODFA, owed a fiduciary obligation and a duty of care to
CODFA;  and
<P>

(c)	as an officer of CODFA, had statutory duties to CODFA, pursuant to section
232 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

263	CODFA then turns to the transfer of funds between CODFA and Cashflow and
pleads that between November 1994 and August 1996 or
thereabouts, Mr Walters
caused `the paid funds' to be paid from CODFA's accounts to Cashflow or to
Cashflow's clients totalling $1,240,641.
<P>

264	CODFA then pleads that between December 1994 and August 1996 or
thereabouts, Mr Walters caused funds to be paid from Cashflow
or Cashflow's
clients to CODFA's accounts, totalling $1,060,641 (`received funds').
<P>

265	CODFA then pleads that as at 9 August 1996 or thereabouts, there was a
deficiency of paid funds over the received funds in the
sum of $180,000.
<P>

266	CODFA's claim against Mr Walters is that he breached the terms of the CODFA
Accounting and Services Agreement earlier set out,
and that he breached the
duties of care owed to CODFA under the Accounting and Services Agreement and
under the Management Agreement
and in tort, for the acts of himself and Mrs
Walters.  Mr Walters is alleged to have breached the duties owed by him as
secretary
of CODFA by way of fiduciary obligations and duty of care to CODFA.
He is also said to have breached his statutory duties owed to
CODFA pursuant to
section 232 of the Corporations Law.  Particulars of the breaches are as
follows:
<P>

	(a)	making advances of CODFA's funds other than in accordance with CODFA's
authorised factoring agreements and/or other authorised
business;
<P>

(b)	preparing, signing and/or presenting to Wright for signing, cheques on
behalf of CODFA that were not properly payable to the
named payee and otherwise
not drawn and presented in accordance with CODFA's authorised business;
<P>

(c)	failing to act in a diligent, honest and careful capacity in accordance
with the duties earlier referred to.
<P>

267	As a result of Walter's alleged breaches of the terms of the CODFA
Accounting and Services Agreement and of the duties earlier
referred to, CODFA
alleges that it suffered loss, particulars being the paid funds and the
opportunity to earn profit on the paid
funds.  CODFA's claim against Mr Walters
is for compensation, including damages for the loss suffered.  That liability
is said to
arise from the general law and/or a section 1317HD Corporations
Law.
<P>

	<b>Dealing with CODFA's claims against Mr Wright, Factors, Mr Walters and
Trans-pac No 2</b>
<P>

268	It is convenient to next set out my findings in relation to CODFA's claims
against Mr Wright, Factors, Mr Walters and Trans-pac
No. 2.
<P>

269	There is no doubt on the evidence, that at all material times Mr Wright was
the managing director of CODFA and a co-signatory
of CODFA's St George and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia accounts (`CODFA's accounts').
<P>

270	Mr Wright in fact admits that he was the managing director of CODFA in
paragraph 3 of the Defence to the Amended Statement of
Claim.  I refer also to
paragraphs 11 and 24 of Mr Kull's statement of 14 September 1998.  The
particular accounts in respect of
which Mr Wright was a co-signatory, were the
St George account No. 100170533 at its Blacktown Branch and the CBA account No.
10026675
at its Beverley Hills Branch.
<P>

271	There is no doubt that at all material times Mr Walters was the secretary
of CODFA and a co-signatory of CODFA's accounts.
<P>

272	The accounts in respect of which Mr Walters was a co-signatory are detailed
in Mr Kull's statement of 14 April 1998, paragraphs
14 and 49.
<P>

	<b>Findings as to the CODFA Management Agreement between Factors and
CODFA</b>
<P>

273	On my findings, the CODFA Management Agreement has been proven to be in
force as at and after November 1994 between Factors
and CODFA by which Factors
agreed with CODFA for Factors to provide the managerial services of Mr Wright
to CODFA in consideration
for CODFA paying to Factors a management fee.
<P>

274	That agreement, on my findings, was made on or about 1 August 1991 and
varied on 3 June 1992 and 30 June 1993.
<P>

275	To the extent that the agreement is express, it is constituted by inter
alia the following documents:
<P>

	(a)	Joint Venture Agreement between CODFA, Kylon, Mr Wright, Mr Kull and
Factors dated 1 August 1991 - and in particular clause
13 of that document
(`the Joint Venture Agreement').
<P>

(b)	Deed of Variation of the Joint Venture Agreement between CODFA, Kylon, Mr
Wright, Mr Kull and Factors dated 3 June 1992.
<P>

(c)	Deed of Variation of the Joint Venture Agreement between CODFA, Kylon, Mr
Wright, Mr Kull and Factors dated 30 June 1993.
<P>

276	To the extent that the agreement is implied, it is on my findings, to be
inferred from the above described documents and is
further inferred from the
following facts and circumstances:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Wright perceived his role as being one in which he would have
responsibility for management:  "I will . . . have overall
control of the
operation of the new company" - [statement of Mr Kull dated 14 April 1998,
paragraph 9].
<P>

(b)	As at and after November 1994, Mr Wright worked at the premises for CODFA
in a managing capacity.
<P>

(c)	Factors rendered to CODFA invoices for work performed by Mr Wright on
Factors' behalf for CODFA.
<P>

(d)	CODFA paid to Factors cheques in the name of Factors for the invoices
rendered.
<P>

277	It was, in my judgment, a term of the CODFA Management Agreement that the
services would be provided honestly and with reasonable
care and diligence.
That term is implied and arises from, inter alia, the following facts and
circumstances:
<P>

	(a)	Under clause 12 of the Joint Venture Agreement, Mr Wright and Factors held
out to CODFA that Mr Wright had expertise in examining
factoring proposals and
would bring that expertise to bear in managing CODFA's business.
<P>

(b)	The nature of the tasks and duties being performed.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Management of CODFA</b>
<P>

278	I turn then to the question of the management of CODFA.
<P>

279	Mr Wright, in his capacity as managing director of CODFA and additionally
by reason of the terms of the CODFA Management Agreement,
was responsible for
the following tasks:
<P>

	(a)	Examining and approving factoring proposals that were submitted to CODFA -
see clause 12 of the Joint Venture Agreement.
<P>

(b)	Ensuring that funds advanced to clients were made in accordance with the
factoring agreement.  This responsibility arises from
the nature of the
factoring business - see the statement of Mr Kull dated 14 April 1998,
paragraph 25.
<P>

(c)	Ensuring that loans or other transfers of moneys to companies of which he
was a director or in which he held some interest or
which were not usual
factoring clients of CODFA, were scrutinised and paid for a proper commercial
purpose - see statement of Mr
Kull dated 14 April 1998 paragraph 25.
<P>

(d)	Co-signing cheques payable by CODFA in the course of CODFA's authorised
business.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Findings as to the CODFA Accounting and Services Agreement</b>
<P>

280	In my judgment, the CODFA Accounting and Services Agreement has been proven
to be in force as at and after November 1994 between
Mr Walters and/or Mrs
Walters, trading as Walters &amp; Associates of the one part and CODFA on the
other part by which Mr Walters
agreed with CODFA for Mr Walters to provide to
CODFA accounting services and other services in consideration for CODFA, paying
to
Mr Walters and Mrs Walters, trading as Walters &amp; Associates, a fee.
<P>

281	That agreement was made on or about 1 August 1991.
<P>

282	To the extent that the agreement is express, it is constituted by clause 18
of the Joint Venture Agreement:  Exhibit PXC page
A20.
<P>

283	To the extent that it is implied, it is constituted by inter alia, the
following facts and circumstances:
<P>

	(a)	As at and after November 1994 until about August 1996, Mr Walters worked
at the premises for CODFA, performing accounting work
and posting into the bank
reconciliation ledger details of cheques drawn on CODFA's account, posting of
debtor invoices received
by CODFA into the accounts receivable ledgers,
processing of receipts received by CODFA, writing cheques, reconciling various
aged
receivable reports for various clients of CODFA, writing up bank deposit
slips for deposits into the account of CODFA.
<P>

(b)	Mr Walters rendered to CODFA, invoices in the name of Walters &amp;
Associates for such accounting services performed by Mr
Walters for CODFA.  The
invoices for the period June 1991 to June 1996 are to be found in Exhibit PXC
at pages A110-237.
<P>

(c)	CODFA delivered to Mr Walters, cheques in the name of Walters &amp;
Associates for the invoices that were rendered.  The copies
of cheque butts in
payment of such invoices for the period August 1991 to September 1996 are
contained in Exhibit PXC pages A270-341.
 The deposit book entries for EJ &amp;
LA Walters account No. 2118250928 which showed deposit of CODFA cheques on
payment of such
invoices for the period 5 June 1992 to 12 march 1996, are
contained in Exhibit PXC pages C249-381.
<P>

284	On my findings, terms of the CODFA Accounting and Services Agreement were
that:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Walters would provide to CODFA services including processing of
authorised cash receipts and drawing for signature of cheques
properly payable
in accordance with CODFA's authorised business.
<P>

(b)	Mr Walters would sign and present to Mr Wright for signing, only cheques
which were payable on behalf of CODFA in accordance
with CODFA's authorised
business.
<P>

(c)	The services provided by Mr Walters would be provided honestly and with
reasonable care and diligence.
<P>

285	I accept CODFA's submission that the terms are implied and arise from the
nature of the tasks and duties being performed.
<P>

	<b>Duties of Mr Wright, Factors and Mr Walters</b>
<P>

286	On my findings, Mr Walters and Mr Wright were at all material times,
officers of CODFA within the meaning of section 231 of
the Corporations Law.
<P>

287	Mr Wright at all material times:
<P>

	(a)	under the CODFA Management Agreement owed a duty of care to CODFA;
<P>

(b)	as managing director of CODFA, owed a fiduciary obligation and a duty of
care to CODFA;
<P>

(c)	as an officer of CODFA, had statutory duties to CODFA pursuant to section
232 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

288	Factors at all material times under the CODFA Management Agreement, owed a
duty of care to CODFA to ensure that the provision
by Factors of services
performed by Mr Wright would be provided with reasonable care and diligence.
<P>

289	Mr Walters at all material times:
<P>

	(a)	under the CODFA Accounting and Services Agreement and in tort, owed a duty
of care to CODFA;
<P>

(b)	as secretary of CODFA, owed a fiduciary obligation and a duty of care to
CODFA;
<P>

(c)	as an officer of CODFA, had statutory duties to CODFA pursuant to section
232 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Books and Records of Cashflow</b>
<P>

290	Mr A.J. Cachia of Bartlett and Cachia, Chartered Accountants, prepared a
report dated 30 April 1998 dealing, inter alia, with
the question of whether
the books and records of Cashflow had been kept in accordance with the
requirements of the Corporations Law.
 His investigation was based upon the
documents identified on pages 2 and 3 of the Report.  The documents included
bank statements,
factoring agreements, Cashflow monthly reports from September
1994 to August 1996, including profit and loss accounts, balance sheets,
trial
balances, summaries of transactions with individual clients, debtors' summary
trial balances for Trans-pac and debtors' reconciliation
and ageing.  A number
of other selected items were made available to Mr Cachia from the provisional
liquidator's investigation file
and Mr Cachia also had access to income tax
returns for the financial years June 1995 to June 1996 and to financial
statements prepared
by Mr Burkett for the financial year 30 June 1995.
<P>

291	Mr Cachia's conclusion which was not challenged during the hearing and is
supported by the evidence, was expressed as follows:
<P>

	<i>"We have formed the opinion that the books and records of Cashflow were not
kept in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations
Law.
Specifically, we bring the following matters to your attention.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Section 1307 Falsification of Books:</cite>
<P>

<i>	In our opinion, based upon the results of our investigation, it would
appear that the books and records of the company were kept
in breach of the
provision of Section 1307 of the law.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Section 232 Duty and Liability of Officers</cite>
<P>

<i>	In our opinion from the investigation conducted, it would appear that this
section has not been complied with.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Section 232(4) Care and Diligence</cite>
<P>

<i>	In our opinion from the investigation conducted, it would appear that this
section has not been complied with.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Section 289</cite>
<P>

<i>	In our opinion from the investigation conducted, it would appear that this
section has not been complied with.</i>
<P>

<i>	In arriving at the opinion that Cashflow did not comply with the above
sections of the Corporations Law, we provide the following
specific
examples:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1995 were incorrect
and resulted in an amended income tax return being lodged
by the provisional
liquidator.  In this regard, the debt due from Transpac No 1 was understated by
$140,000 as at the aforementioned
date.  This was a direct result of a
post-balance date accrual made on 3 October 1995 accruing 1996 income into the
1995 year.  This
adjustment forms part of the $224,706 discrepancy in the June
1995 summary . . . .  As a consequence until this was subsequently
discovered
it was not readily apparent that Trans-pac No 1 was then in breach of it's
factoring facilities and the account was in
fact delinquent at that
stage.</i>
<P>

<i>	In consequence of the error and entry made as a result, the 1995 financial
statements reported a profit.  The true position was not
disclosed at that
time.  It required an adjustment in respect of fees paid and written-off in
part or as to the whole of the debt
due from Trans-pac No 1.  Consequently the
profit would be recorded as a loss and in turn both the tax paid and the
dividend declared
would not have been paid.  This in turn would require
adjustment of the fees payable to COD Factors, Walters &amp; Associates and
COD
Factors Australia.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The Trans-pac ledger account in the books of Cashflow showed a balance
owing by Transpac with agreed with the balance as reported
on the monthly
statements presented to the Board meetings, however there were numerous
computerised ledger entries with substantial
adjustments.</i>
<P>

<i>	In order to assess the actual position, a manual reconstruction of this
account was completed by Mr A Bonvino and is included in
this report as
annexure `B'.  We chose a representative sample of the transactions identified
in annexure `B' and verified those
transactions by examining source documents
such as cheque butts and bank statements.  We are satisfied that annexure `B'
has been
prepared correctly.</i>
<P>

<i>	Annexure `B' reveals materials discrepancies in that the balance of the
Trans-pac debt presented on the monthly statements was less
than the actual
debt.  For example, extracted below is the reporter debt and the actual debt
for the month of July to October 1995:</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>Month</cite><i>			</i><cite>Actual Debt</cite><i>
</i><cite>Reported Debt</cite>
<P>

<i>	July 1995			923487		753211</i>
<P>

<i>	August 1995		977696		737439</i>
<P>

<i>	September 1995		1026824		766824</i>
<P>

<i>	October 1995		1147809		780836</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Unauthorised Payments</b>
<P>

<b>	</b><u>The Cashflow Unauthorised Payments</u>
<P>

292	On my findings, between November 1994 and August 1996 or approximately
between these dates, Mr Walters caused the `paid funds'
of CODFA to be paid
from CODFA's accounts to Cashflow or Cashflow's clients, totalling $1,240,641
and between December 1994 and August
1996 or thereabouts, Mr Walters caused the
`received funds' to be paid from Cashflow or Cashflow's clients to the St
George account
totalling $1,060,641.  The subject bank statements for CODFA for
its CBA, St George and Burkett accounts relating to the unauthorised
payments
are to be found in Exhibit PXC Volume B at pages 52 to 134.  The copies of
cheques drawn appear at PXC-B177-215.  The summary
of payments is set out in
Annexure GMG4 to the statement of Mr Graham Green made on 27 March 1998.
<P>

293	The payments were unauthorised:  see the statement of Mr Kull dated 14
April 1998, paragraphs 47 and 76 - 79.
<P>

294	As at 9 August 1996, or approximately on this date, there was a deficiency
of paid funds over the received funds in the sum
of $180,000.
<P>

	<u>The Trans-pac No. 2 Unauthorised Payments</u>
<P>

295	On 24 May 1996, Mr Walters drew a cheque for $49,626 on CODFA's account in
favour of Trans-pac No. 2.
<P>

296	Between June 1996 and August 1996, Mr Walters withdrew by electronic
transfer of funds, sums in the total of $396,498 which
were paid into the
account of Trans-pac No. 2.  These payments are admitted by Trans-pac No. 2 -
see paragraph 3(a) defence filed
25 September 1997 in proceedings 50114 of
1998.  The payments are otherwise established by the evidence - see CODFA's
bank statements,
Exhibit PXC pages C45-51;  handwritten list prepared by Mr
Walters of payments from CODFA to Trans-pac No. 2, Exhibit PXC page C44;
 bank
statements for Trans-pac No. 2 for 11 June 1996 - 12 June 1996 and 19 June 1996
- 20 June 1996, Exhibit PXC page C52.
<P>

297	These moneys were paid by Mr Walters without authorisation, to or for the
benefit of Trans-pac No. 2 which received the moneys
without giving any
consideration for it.  In those circumstances, Trans-pac No. 2 became liable at
law and in Equity to restore CODFA's
moneys to it.  On the available evidence,
I accept that Trans-pac No. 2 is not shown to have any unsecured property at
this time.
<P>

	<b>Holding as to CODFA's Claims Against Mr Wright</b>
<P>

298	In my judgment, Mr Wright breached the duties alleged by CODFA and each of
them.  The breaches were:
<P>

	(a)	Failing to ensure that CODFA made advances only in accordance with its
authorised factoring agreements or other authorised
business.  I refer here to
the cheques drawn on CODFA's accounts in favour of Cashflow or parties not
clients of Cashflow - see statement
of Mr Kull dated 14 April 1998 paragraphs
70-72;  see Exhibit PXC pages B177, B178, B181-184, B186, B189-194, B223.
<P>

(b)	Signing cheques carelessly without ensuring that the cheques were properly
payable to the named payee and otherwise drawn and
presented in accordance with
CODFA's authorised business dealings.  The cheques were drawn on CODFA's
accounts in favour of Cashflow
or parties not clients of Cashflow - see the
statement of Mr Kull dated 14 April 1998, paragraphs 70-72 and see Exhibit PXC
pages
B177, B178, B181-184, B186, B189-194 and B223.
<P>

(c)	Failing to monitor, supervise and check that Mr Walters was:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	acting in a diligent, honest and careful capacity in accordance
with his duties;
<P>

(ii)	acting in accordance with the Accounting and Services Agreement;
<P>

(iii)	acting in accordance with the Management Arrangement;
<P>

(iv)	acting in accordance with the authorised factoring business of CODFA;
<P>

(v)	drawing, signing and/or presenting cheques only in accordance with the
authorised operation of CODFA's accounts.
<P>

[In relation to the matters dealt with in sub-paragraph (c) above, I note that
concerns about the way in which Mr Walters was performing
his duties were
raised with Mr Wright by Mr Kull in a meeting on 24 October 1995 - T 18 March
1999 pages 29.26 - 29.33.  Mr Wright
failed to implement the resolutions and in
particular resolution 6 regarding risk management procedures - T 18 March 1999
pages 29.26-30.13.
 The resolutions are set out in the minutes of the meeting
appearing at PX 1954.  The breaches appear from the fact that the unauthorised
payments were made.  The breach by Mr Wright is also confirmed by his own
statement tendered as regarding his practice in countersigning
cheques -
paragraphs 171-178 inclusive of Mr Wright's statement, Exhibit P17.]
<P>

(d)	Failing to ensure that CODFA had a proper system of controls, audit and/or
review in its business to avoid any defalcation by
officers or employees such
as Mr Walters.
<P>

<i>	</i>[I refer here to the evidence that Mr Wright failed to implement the
resolutions (in particular resolution 6 regarding risk management
procedures -
see T 18 March 1999 pages 29.26-30.13.  The breaches appear from the fact that
the unauthorised payments were made.]
<P>

	<b>Holding as to CODFA's Claim Against Factors</b>
<P>

299	I accept CODFA's submission that Factors breached the term of the CODFA
Management Agreement that the services would be provided
honestly and with
reasonable care and diligence.  I accept further CODFA's claim that Factors is
in breach of the duty of care owed
to CODFA to ensure that the provision by
Factors of services performed by Mr Wright would be provided with reasonable
care and diligence.
 The breaches are constituted by the fact that the
performance by Mr Wright of management services pursuant to the CODFA
Management
Agreement, was not carried out with reasonable care and diligence.
The breaches are referred to above under the sub-heading `Holding
as to CODFA's
Claims Against Wright'.
<P>

	<b>Holding as to CODFA's Claim Against Mr Walters</b>
<P>

300	I accept CODFA's submission that Mr Walters is shown to have breached the
terms of the CODFA Accounting and Service Agreement,
earlier referred to in
paragraph 284 and the duty alleged in paragraph 287 and each of them.
<P>

301	The breaches are:
<P>

	(a)	Making advances of CODFA's funds other than in accordance with CODFA's
authorised factoring agreements and/or other authorised
business - see the
statement of Mr Kull, 14 April 1998 paragraphs 74-82.
<P>

(b)	Preparing, signing and presenting to Mr Wright for signing, cheques on
behalf of CODFA that were not properly payable to the
named payee and otherwise
drawn and presented in accordance with CODFA's authorised business.
<P>

(c)	Failing to act in a diligent, honest and careful capacity in accordance
with his duties - see statement of Mr Kull, 14 April
1998 paragraph 74;
evidence of Mr Kull in cross-examination, 18 March 1999 T 33.43 - .53
<P>

	<b>Holding as to CODFA's Claim Against Trans-pac No. 2</b>
<P>

302	Trans-pac No. 2 was plainly not a client of CODFA - see statement of Mr
Kull dated 14 April 1998 paragraph 51.
<P>

303	The payments made to Trans-pac No. 2 were not authorised and were not for
any CODFA commercial purpose.
<P>

304	CODFA has demanded repayment of the funds paid to Trans-pac - see letter
from John Burrell solicitors to Trans-pac No. 2 dated
4 September 1996, Exhibit
PXC pages C56-57.
<P>

305	Trans-pac has failed to repay any funds to CODFA:  see paragraph 20
statement of Mr Kull dated 30 October 1998.
<P>

306	Leave to proceed against Trans-pac No. 2 has been granted.
<P>

	<b>Loss</b>
<P>

307	I accept CODFA's submission that as a result of the breaches by Mr Wright,
Factors and Mr Walters, CODFA has suffered loss in
that it has been deprived of
the paid funds and of the opportunity to earn profit on the paid funds.
<P>

308	In the result, Mr Wright, Factors and Mr Walters are liable to pay
compensation to CODFA including damages, for the loss suffered
by CODFA.  This
liability arises from the general law and also by reason of section 1317HD of
the Corporations Law.
<P>

309	It is appropriate that judgment be entered for CODFA against Mr Wright,
Factors and Mr Walters.
<P>

310	It is appropriate that judgment be entered against Trans-pac No. 2 in the
sum of $446,124.  I stand over for further submissions
to be addressed when
Short Minutes are brought in, the question of whether, as claimed by CODFA,
liberty should be reserved to it
to claim an equitable interest in such (if
any) property, as may come into the hands of the liquidator of Trans-pac No.
2.
<P>

	<b>Cashflow's Case against Factors, Mr Wright and Mr Walters</b>
<P>

<b>	Operation of the Factoring Deed</b>
<P>

311	Cashflow advanced detailed submissions in terms of the precise operation of
the Factoring Deed.  I accept these submissions.
<P>

312	The first step is that the client makes out a First Schedule identifying
the debts which the creditor desires to sell to the
financier.  The format of
the First Schedule to the deed provides space for the listing of the debts on
the first page and there
is a second page of the First Schedule which requires
full details of invoices to be provided.  Under the factoring deed, it is the
payment of the price which is proof of the acceptance of the offer to sell the
debt.  In relation to Trans-pac's First Schedules
after 7 December 1994, the
debts are not identified.  They were therefore, I accept, never purchased.
Many of the First Schedules
that were submitted after 7 December 1994 were not
even signed by anyone on behalf of Trans-pac.  There is then a gap in the First
Schedules from 31 May 1995 to 1 March 1996.  The effects of the departures from
the procedures laid down in the Factoring Deed is
that Cashflow was making
loans to Trans-pac No. 1, on no security or inadequate security.  Here, I note
that the charge that Trans-pac
No. 1 gave was to secure moneys owing under the
factoring agreement, and that there was also an `all moneys' clause.  However,
the
only property that was charged was the book debts themselves.  The
guarantees related only to money owing under the factoring deed,
and so would
not apply to moneys advanced without there being an assignment of debts under
the factoring deed.
<P>

313	While there was a `Trans-pac general ledger control account' in the books
of Cashflow, I accept that the account did not correctly
reflect the true legal
nature of the arrangements.  If there had been a debt purchased from Trans-pac,
the purchase price of that
debt was money which Cashflow had outlaid on its
stock-in-trade.  It was not a loan to Trans-pac.  If the debtor paid, and
Cashflow
received the money so paid, it receiver it as it's own money.  If the
debtor did not pay, then Cashflow had the right to reassign
the debt, and it
might come to be owed money by Trans-pac upon any such reassignment occurring.
The general ledger control account
mixed together indiscriminately moneys that
were owing by Trans-pac and moneys that were payable by debtors that had been
assigned
by Trans-pac to Cashflow.  The balance of the account (when corrected
for errors) is commercially useful, I accept, as an indicator
of the total
amount that is due to Cashflow from Trans-pac and assigned Trans-pac debtors in
total, and Cashflow used this balance
as part of its proof of loss.  Its true
legal nature, I accept, does require to be recognised.
<P>

314	After November 1995, I accept that there was no factoring at all because
Trans-pac No. 1 stopped business and Trans-pac No.
2 began.  There was no
agreement for factoring, I accept, between Trans-pac No. 2 and Cashflow.
<P>

	<b>The date when Trans-pac No. 1 Stopped and Trans-pac No. 2 Started Carrying
on Business</b>
<P>

315	This is a factual question.  I accept Cashflow's submission that the
correct conclusion from the evidence is that Trans-pac
No. 1 stopped business
in November 1995 and that Trans-pac No. 2 started at that time.
<P>

316	The bases for this conclusion on the evidence are as follows:
<P>

	(i)	In September/October 1995 at the very latest (`after about 12 months . .
.'), Mr Bonvino became concerned about lateness of
the monthly meetings of
Cashflow directors and lack of information from Mr Walters.  In retrospect I
accept that it can be seen that
the reason for the lateness was that Mr Walters
had started to make the unauthorised `borrowings' from CODFA, in circumstances
where
they could not be `repaid'.  From 17 August 1995, there were always
`borrowings' from CODFA that had not been repaid, and by 19 September
1995, the
`borrowings' that were attributable to money paid to Trans-pac, totalled
$180,000.  This, I accept, is indicative of Trans-pac
No. 1 itself being in
financial difficulties from at least mid-August 1995.  When Trans-pac No. 1 had
these difficulties, it's directors,
I accept, had the motivation to abandon
Trans-pac No 1 and to recommence using a new shelf company.
<P>

(ii)	Further, the directors of Trans-pac had given mortgages over their homes
in February 1995 (and their sons had also mortgaged
a property to Cashflow at
Kemps Creek).  Each mortgage was to secure amounts owing under the guarantee
that had been given, which
was in turn a guarantee of amounts owing by
Trans-pac No. 1 under the factoring deed.  The directors of Trans-pac had a
motive to
stop the build-up of a mortgage debt against their real estate and
the real estate of their sons, by incurring no further debt in
Trans-pac No.
1.
<P>

(iii)	On 9 October 1995, Mr Peter Panayi and Mr Terry Panayi were appointed as
directors of Trans-pac No. 2.
<P>

(iv)	On 13 October 1995 Trans-pac No. 2, which was formerly a shelf company,
adopted the name of Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited.
 It's principal place of
business is the same as that of Trans-pac No. 1.
<P>

(v)	On 31 October 1995, the National Australia Bank issued the first bank
statement of Trans-pac No. 2.
<P>

(vi)	On 27 November 1995, cheques drawn on Cashflow and made out to Trans-pac
No. 1 started to be banked to the bank account of
Trans-pac No. 2.  All cheques
which were drawn on Cashflow and made out to Trans-pac No. 1 thereafter were
deposited into the bank
account of Trans-pac No. 2.
<P>

(vii)	The dealings in the Trans-pac No. 1 bank account after 27 November 1995,
I accept, are sporadic and not the sort of dealings
that are to be expected
from a company that is actively trading.  The dealings in the Trans-pac No. 2
account, I accept, are indicative
of trading.
<P>

(viii)	A report of the Credit Reference Association of Australia Limited shows
that there was an enquiry about the credit status
of Trans-pac No. 1 on 27
November 1995, but then no further enquiries until CODFA requested a report on
14 August 1996.
<P>

(ix)	On 9 February 1996, the account of Trans-pac No. 1 with the National
Australia Bank at Strathfield was closed.
<P>

(x)	On 21 February 1996, the name of Trans-pac No. 1 was changed to Strathfield
Information Processing Bureau Pty Limited.
<P>

(xi)	From 9 April 1996, debtor enquiry reports exist in the name of Trans-pac
No. 2.
<P>

(xii)	The provisional liquidator's report states that Peter Panayi says that
Trans-pac No. 1 transferred its business to Trans-pac
No. 2 in November 1995.
The notes of interview of Mr Star with Mr Panayi of 17 September 1996 appear
quite unequivocal that Trans-pac
No. 1 `ceased to operate in November 1995 and
thereafter the business was transferred to CDC Packaging Pty Limited which
changed
its name to Trans-pac Australia Pty Limited'.  [PX 1957]
<P>

(xiii)	I accept that the broad picture of the assets and liabilities of
Trans-pac No. 1 which Mr Panayi disclosed to Mr Star on
17 September 1996 was
`group tax $700,000, payroll tax $100,000.  Workers compensation could be
$50-$100,000.  Cashflow for whatever
it is owed', and assets of, in substance,
nil.  This picture, I accept, is consistent with the picture of the assets and
liabilities
of Trans-pac No. 1 contained in its Report as to Affairs.  That
supports the view that the Report as to Affairs is based upon trading
that the
company did up to November 1995.
<P>

(xiv)	The only mention in the evidence of any other date being attributed to
the changeover of the business is Mr Gelder reports,
that a defence of
Trans-pac No. 2 in Equity Proceedings 2045 of 1997 (verified by Mr Peter
Panayi), states that Trans-pac No. 2 took
over the management of Trans-pac No.
1 in April 1996.  To my mind, that evidence ought not alter the conclusion to
which I have reached
for the reasons:
<P>

<i>	</i>(a)	That a hearsay reference to such a statement in an affidavit
verifying a pleading by a person who is not called in the proceedings
is of no
weight.
<P>

(b)	That the inevitable tendency of the defence attributing a late start to
Trans-pac No. 2's business would be to lessen the potential
liability of
Trans-pac No. 2 in the proceedings in which the defence was sworn.  Mr Peter
Panayi is someone who, on the evidence
before the Court about him, one would
not automatically accept.  Thus his statement in that particular affidavit is
of even less
weight than a statement in an affidavit verifying a pleading
ordinarily would be.
<P>

(c)	The proceedings in which that defence was filed are ones that were
renumbered as 50114 of 1998, presently before the Court -
the defence is one
which has had no one appearing in Court to support it.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Personal Common Law and Equitable Claims of Cashflow Against Mr
Wright and Mr Walters</b>
<P>

<b>	As against Mr Wright</b>
<P>

317	Cashflow pleads that Mr Wright, as managing director of Cashflow and Mr
Walters, as company secretary of Cashflow and also on
behalf of Walters &amp;
Associates, failed to keep and maintain accounting records of Cashflow in
accordance with section 289 of
the Corporations Law.
<P>

318	Cashflow then pleads that by reason of section 588E(3) and (4) of the
Corporations Law, Cashflow was insolvent during the twelve
month period ending
on the relation back day.
<P>

319	Cashflow pleads in the alternative that it was insolvent in fact during the
relevant period which is defined as the twelve month
period ending on the
relation back day.
<P>

320	Cashflow pleads that further or in the alternative, there were reasonable
grounds for suspecting that Cashflow was insolvent
during the relevant
period.
<P>

321	Cashflow pleads that Mr Wright was or should have been aware that Cashflow
was insolvent during the relevant period and was
on notice that there were
reasonable grounds for suspecting that Cashflow was insolvent.  Particulars in
support of this allegation
are that Mr Wright was managing director of Cashflow
during the relevant period and as such, was responsible for the day to day
administration
and overall supervision of Cashflow.  Further particulars are
that the accounting records of Cashflow were not kept in accordance
with
section 289 of the Corporations Law and that Cashflow made advances to
Trans-pac No 1 in breach of the relevant factoring deed
and/or after Trans-pac
No 1 had ceased to trade.
<P>

322	Cashflow then pleads that in the premises, Mr Wright is liable to pay to
Cashflow, damages or compensation equal to the amount
of loss sustained by
Cashflow by reason of it's insolvent trading.  Mr Wright's liability is said to
be based upon his breaches of
statutory duty brought in respect of the causes
of action as stipulated in section 588G and section 1317HD of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

323	Cashflow also pleads that at all material times Mr Wright acted as managing
director and as director, servant and/or agent of
Factors in relation to the
affairs of Cashflow and that in breach of his duty as a director he so
negligently, carelessly and recklessly,
managed the affairs of Cashflow and
further in breach of his fiduciary duties and/or statutory duties caused
Cashflow to suffer damage
and loss as a result of the performance of his duties
in the manner then pleaded.
<P>

324	Particulars of negligence and breaches of fiduciary duties by Mr Wright are
detailed in paragraph 32 of the amended cross-claim
brought by Cashflow in
proceedings 50177 of 1997.  The eighteen particulars are as follows:
<P>

	(i)	Failure to ensure that advances were made by Cashflow to Trans-pac No. 1
in accordance with the relevant Factoring Deed.
<P>

(ii)	Failing to ensure that Cashflow had a proper system of controls in its
business or adhered to such a system.
<P>

(iii)	Failing to conduct proper enquiry or investigation into the affairs of
Trans-pac No. 1 to ensure compliance with the relevant
Factoring Deed and Deed
of Charge.
<P>

(iv)	Failing to ensure that Cashflow made advances at all only in accordance
with an executed Factoring Deed.
<P>

(v)	Failing to monitor, supervise and check that Walters was acting in a
diligent, honest and efficient capacity.
<P>

(vi)	Failing to monitor that Walters in his capacity as secretary of Cashflow
or a principal of Walters and Associates was acting
in accordance with the
dictates of the policy of Cashflow and in particular drawing cheques in
accordance with the Authority in relation
to the Account and not otherwise.
<P>

(vii)	Failing to ensure that Walters entered into factoring agreements which
were proper, suitable and with sufficient security
to enable the factoring of
the debts and the realisation of them without loss being incurred by
Cashflow.
<P>

(viii)	Failing in the circumstances to conduct and/or supervise audits,
reviews, and implement a system of checks and balances to
ensure and/or avoid
any defalcation by employees, and/or agents in particular such as Walters as
occurred;
<P>

(ix)	Failing in the circumstances to carry out diligently, efficiently and
effectively the management of Cashflow's business to
the extent that it
required Cashflow to be put into liquidation as a result, inter alia, of the
conduct of Walters and Associates
in conjunction with Factors Australia.
<P>

(x)	Failing to ensure that factoring arrangements were only given as against
advances with sufficient security and that if security
was to be given for
limited periods of time alternatively security to supplement and/or replace
security offered was available and
able to be put into position.
<P>

(xi)	Allowing himself to be put into a position of conflict to Cashflow,
detriment where he was a director of Factors Australia
and Factors and in the
circumstances deferred his position and breached his fiduciary and statutory
duties to Cashflow by advancing
the interests of Factors Australia as a result
of which Cashflow sustained loss and damage.
<P>

(xii)	Failing to ask for cash book reconciliations to be compared to amounts
noted in financial statements thereby not detecting
abnormalities and/or
unauthorised advances which would have been so disclosed to him upon
perusal.
<P>

(xiii)	Signing cheques and leaving them with Walters to fill in the amounts and
counter sign them thereby offering an opportunity
and/or temptation to engage
in fraudulent conduct.
<P>

(xiv)	Failing to attend the premises throughout the day and in particular by
only attending for a short period in the day thereby
leaving the premises
unattended and without proper or adequate supervision to ensure that the
business would run properly and not
otherwise.
<P>

(xv)	Declaring dividends when Cashflow as insolvent.
<P>

(xvi)	Failing to monitor and/or keep himself informed of the status of the loan
accounts in respect of advances between Cashflow
and Factors Australia.
<P>

(xvii)	Failing to keep books and records in accordance with Section 289 of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

(xviii)	Allowing payments to be made to Factors Australia by Cashflow without
proper arrangements, unsecured, and for no apparent
purpose benefiting
Cashflow, alternatively failing to prevent such transactions occurring.
<P>

325	Cashflow then pleads that in the premises, Mr Wright was at all material
times under a duty to comply with the provisions of
section 232(2) and (6) of
the Corporations Law and in breach of those duties failed to conform to and/or
comply with the law as a
result of which Cashflow suffered loss and damage.
<P>

326	Cashflow in the alternative, or in addition to its other claims pleads that
Mr Wright and/or Mr Walters made a number of representations
to Mr Bonvino, a
director of Cashflow.  These are said to have been that the monthly accounts of
Cashflow for the 1995-1996 financial
year were correct;  that advances were
being made to Trans-pac No 1 in accordance with the factoring deed or as agreed
and not otherwise;
 and that the Trans-pac account was in good order.
<P>

327	Cashflow pleads that at the time of making these representations, Mr Wright
and/or Mr Walters did not have reasonable grounds
for making the same.
<P>

328	Cashflow pleads that as to Mr Wright, he:
<P>

	(i)	accepted monthly accounts given to him by Mr Walters, when he had not
carried out any checks of the accuracy of the accounts,
and no systems or
alternatively no reasonably adequate system of controls was in place to ensure
the accounts were accurate;
<P>

(ii)	had made no enquiries (or no reasonable enquiries) to ascertain whether or
not the advances to Trans-pac were being paid in
accordance with the factoring
deed or otherwise as agreed;
<P>

(iii)	had made no enquiries (or alternatively no reasonable enquiries) to
ascertain whether or not the Trans-pac account was in
good order;
<P>

(iv)	had taken no steps (or alternatively no adequate steps) to implement
systems to assist in achieving accurate monthly accounts
in the fund;
<P>

(v)	had taken no steps (or alternatively no adequate steps) to assist in
ensuring that advances would in future be made in accordance
with the factoring
deed;
<P>

(vi)	had taken no steps (or alternatively no adequate steps) to assist in
ensuring that the Trans-pac account would in future would
be in good order.
<P>

329	Cashflow also pleads that Mr Walters knew of the lack of reasonable grounds
because he was responsible for the failure to take,
adhere to and implement the
factoring deed and steps required to be taken and not in fact taken by Mr
Wright.
<P>

330	Cashflow pleads that the representations were material and were relied upon
by Mr Bonvino as a director of Cashflow in continuing
to cause Pyrafount to
advance funds to Cashflow to be used as working capital;  in inducing other
persons to advance funds to Cashflow
to be used as working capital;  in not
investigating himself, the books and records of Cashflow until August 1996;  in
approving
the payment of dividends and fees in respect of the financial year
ending 30 June 1995 as a director of Cashflow and in allowing
Cashflow to
continue to trade.
<P>

331	Cashflow pleads that were it not for the representations, it is likely that
Mr Bonvino would have investigated the accounts
of Cashflow as at 30 June 1995
as a result of which such investigation would have shown the accounts to be
incorrect and by reason
of the foregoing, no dividends or fees would have been
paid and no losses of capital or unauthorised transactions would have occurred
after that date.
<P>

332	Cashflow pleads that the representations were made in trade or commerce and
were misleading or deceptive within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW) </i> in that the debt due from Trans-pac No 1 as at 30
June 1995 was understated in the financial accounts by $140,000 and the
Trans-pac
No 1 account was delinquent as at 30 June 1995 and advances had been
made other than in accordance with the factoring deed or as
agreed.
<P>

333	Cashflow pleads that by reason of these matters, it suffered loss and
damage.
<P>

334	Cashflow in the alternative, pleads that the insolvent transactions
occurred by reason of Mr Wright's negligence or alternatively,
were a breach of
Mr Wright's statutory obligation to Cashflow set out in section 232(4) of the
law.
<P>

335	Cashflow also pleads that during the relevant period it entered into a
number of transactions pursuant to which it paid the
sum of $772,172 to CODFA;
it made payments to Trans-pac No 1;  it paid dividends of $105,430 and it paid
fees of $113,800.
<P>

336	An alternative claim put by Cashflow is that the uncommercial transactions
occurred by reason of Mr Wright's negligence or alternatively
were a breach of
Mr Wright's statutory obligation to Cashflow set out in section 232(4) of the
law.
<P>

	<b>As against Mr Walters</b>
<P>

337	In relation to Mr Walters, Cashflow pleads that in the course of it's
activities the following agreements were entered into:
<P>

	(a)	a Factoring Deed dated 1 September 1994 between Trans-pac No 1 and
Cashflow;
<P>

(b)	a company charge dated 1 September 1994 pursuant to which Trans-pac No 1
gave a fixed and specific charge over it's book debts
in favour of Cashflow;
<P>

(c)	a Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity dated 1 September 1994, pursuant to which
Tony Attallah, Terry Panayi and Patricia Kyriakou
guaranteed the obligations of
Trans-pac to Cashflow under the Factoring Deed;
<P>

(d)	a Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity dated 16 February 1995, pursuant to which
Tony Attallah, Peter Panayi, Elly Panayi, Terry
Panayi, Patricia Kyriakou and
Christopher Mark Panayi, inter alia, guaranteed the obligations of Trans-pac No
1 to Cashflow under
the Factoring Deed;
<P>

(e)	a Deed dated 16 February 1995 pursuant to which Patricia Panayi guaranteed
the obligations of Trans-pac No 1 to Cashflow under
the Factoring Deed;
<P>

(f)	a Mortgage dated 16 February 1995, given by Terry Panayi and Patricia
Kyriakou over property described by folio identifier 20/1/581
in favour of
Cashflow to secure the obligations of Terry Panayi and Patricia Kyriakou to
Cashflow pursuant to the second guarantee;
<P>

(g)	a Mortgage dated 16 February 1995 given by Terry Panayi and Christopher
Panayi to Cashflow pursuant to the second guarantee;
<P>

(h)	a Mortgage dated 16 February 1995 given by Peter Panayi and Elly Panayi
over a property described as folio identifier 5/18295
in favour of Cashflow, to
secure the obligations of Peter and Elly Panayi to Cashflow pursuant to the
second guarantee;
<P>

(i)	acknowledgments dated 16 February 1995 by Terry Panayi and Patricia Panayi,
Peter and Elly Panayi, Christopher Mark Panayi and
Terry Peter Panayi, Tony
Attallah and Patricia Panayi pursuant to which each of them gave certain
acknowledgments regarding the second
guarantee and/or the third guarantee
and/or the first mortgage and/or the second mortgage and/or the third
mortgage.
<P>

338	Cashflow then plead that Mr Walters, by discharges of mortgage dated 7 May
1996 wrongfully facilitated the discharge of the
first mortgage and third
mortgage by the unauthorised execution of the discharges for which Cashflow
pleads that it received no benefit.
<P>

339	Cashflow further pleads that Mr Walters, as an officer of Cashflow and on
behalf of Walters &amp; Associates, undertook or caused
or allowed the
occurrence of the following:
<P>

	(a)	Mr Walters made advances to Trans-pac No 1 knowing that the account was
delinquent and/or the advances were not in accordance
with the Factoring Deed
or as agreed and/or the advances were not in accordance with the charge given
by Cashflow;
<P>

(b)	Mr Walters prepared monthly management reports which were false to his
knowledge;
<P>

(c)	Mr Walters made advances to Trans-pac No 1 knowing that it was unlikely
that such advances would be recoverable;
<P>

(d)	Mr Walters prepared the accounts of Cashflow and included fees in respect
of advances to Trans-pac No 1 knowing that the calculation
of the fees was
incorrect and such fees were unlikely to be recovered;
<P>

(e)	Mr Walters prepared the 30 June 1995 accounts of Cashflow knowingly
understating the debt of Trans-pac No 1 by $140,000;
<P>

(f)	Mr Walters made advances to Factors Australia which were not authorised and
in respect of which no arrangements were in place;
<P>

(g)	Mr Walters failed to inform the directors of Cashflow of those matters.
<P>

340	Cashflow then pleads that by reason of the above matters, Mr Walters acted
in breach of statutory duties he was bound to observe
pursuant to section 232,
sub-sections (2), (4) and (6) of the law.
<P>

341	Cashflow also pleads that the same conduct was misleading or deceptive
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></i>.
<P>

342	Cashflow then pleads that Factors breached the Management Agreement
referred to in it's cross-claim.
<P>

343	Cashflow's pleading seeks relief in terms of an order that the
cross-defendants pay to the cross-claimants damages and interest
and a
declaration of it's entitlement to contribution or indemnity from CODFA
together with interest.
<P>

	<b>Holdings as to Cashflow's Claims against Mr Wright, Factors and Mr
Walters</b>
<P>

<b>	Mr Wright's negligence and breaches of duties and obligations owed to
Cashflow</b>
<P>

344	I accept that, as managing director, Mr Wright owed a duty of care and
fiduciary duties.  The duty of care is the common law
duty of care which
underlies a task.
<P>

345	I accept Cashflow's submission that Mr Wright was responsible for the
overall operation of Cashflow, including being responsible
for supervising Mr
Walters.
<P>

346	Mr Wright admits on the pleadings, that he was the managing director of
Cashflow.
<P>

347	The written explanation of the factoring proposal that Mr Wright gave to Mr
Bonvino at their first meeting:
<P>

	(i)	represented that the clients were `small to medium sized businesses which
are profitable and backed by a reasonable level of
assets'.  This could only be
known if it had been inquired into;
<P>

(ii)	gave `founding director, Peter Wright' a central role in the operation,
and said he `will continue to control all aspects of
the company's growth'.
`Peter Wright's long and successful trading history speaks for itself';
<P>

(iii)	said that `security requirements for factoring clients are very stringent
and provide a very secure base for the security
of loan funds'.
<P>

348	The oral explanation which Mr Wright gave to Mr Bonvino at their first
meeting stated that it was he, Mr Wright, who intended
to run the new
business.
<P>

349	At the second meeting, Mr Wright undertook that he would be responsible for
the day to day running of the operation and be paid
for it.
<P>

350	At one of the earlier negotiating meetings, Mr Wright told Mr Bonvino that
the factoring business was his business, he commenced
it, and he used Mr
Walters to do the accounting work.
<P>

351	At one of the June/July 1994 meetings, Mr Wright said that Mr Walters
helped him, and that he, Mr Wright, would instruct Mr
Walters and be
responsible for him.  Mr Wright also told Mr Bonvino that Mr Walters would do
data collection and processing daily,
and report to Mr Wright directly.  Mr
Wright's management fee was for `running the show'.  `We do everything possible
to protect
your investment'.  Mr Wright said that a First Schedule was filled
out every time any debts were factored.  Mr Wright said that before
the debts
were factored, the debtors that were to be purchased were spot checked, to make
sure that they were collectable.
<P>

352	Mr Bonvino agreed to pay the fee that Mr Wright asked (5% of profits
monthly and an additional 50% of profits yearly) on the
basis that it was for
both marketing and management.  The monthly payment that Mr Wright received was
later agreed more specifically
as being 5% of gross fees.  This high level of
remuneration, I accept, is sensible (and likely to be agreed to by Mr Bonvino),
only
if there is a correspondingly high degree of responsibility.
<P>

353	Mr Wright, it will be recalled, told Mr Kull in about June 1994, that he
would manage the new company that was to be formed
and which became
Cashflow.
<P>

354	Mr Wright told Mr Bonvino that he intended to duplicate the existing CODFA
business and the thrust of the proposal was that
everything in Cashflow would
operate as it did in CODFA.  Under the Joint Venture Agreement relating to
CODFA, Mr Wright had promised
to `use his expertise to examine factoring
proposals . . . and to attend to the management of the factoring business to be
carried
on by the company' [Joint Venture Agreement clause 12].  The role of
Walters &amp; Associates in CODFA was as accountants.
<P>

355	On 15 March 1993, Mr Wright sent to Mr Kull a proposal for his `new
management remuneration package'.
<P>

356	Mr Wright, I accept, in fact did tasks appropriate for a manager (rather
than a mere salesman).  This included being the person
who contacted Mr Bonvino
to ask for new deposits of funds.
<P>

357	Mr Wright's conduct of the affairs of Cashflow, I accept, was negligent and
a breach of the fiduciary and statutory duties owed
by him.  Each of the
allegations particularised in paragraph 32 of the Cashflow amended statement of
claim is made out on the evidence
and is upheld.
<P>

358	Facts relevant to the breaches which I accept, have been proved are as
follows:
<P>

	(i)	At an early meeting, Mr Wright told Mr Bonvino that a First Schedule to
the factoring deed was filled out every time there
was a factoring.  The First
Schedule requires identification of debts.  Mr Wright, I accept, did not adhere
to his own standards.
<P>

<i>	</i>(ii)	Mr Wright represented that the business would be carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the factoring deed.  On the
evidence, it was
not.
<P>

(iii)	At an early meeting, Mr Wright told Mr Bonvino that they advanced only
80% of the face value of the debtors and in addition
have other security.  On
the evidence, he did not adhere to his own standards in this respect, allowing
over 100% of the face value
of debtors supposedly assigned to be advanced.
<P>

(iv)	At an early meeting, Mr Bonvino told Mr Wright and Mr Walters to make sure
that the invoices that were provided by clients
were spot checked.  In fact on
the evidence, invoices were not provided at all by Trans-pac, let alone being
spot checked.  It is,
I accept, a usual procedure in factoring to receive and
spot check invoices.
<P>

(v)	At an early meeting, Mr Wright told Mr Bonvino that he never left signed
cheques and always checked to see what the cheque is
made out to before he
signed it.  Mr Wright admitted to Mr Star that `quite often he'd leave a cheque
made out to the company which
is crossed without figures in it because they
were waiting on the schedules.  That's the First Schedules to be received from
the
client and he is sure that's probably one way he [Walters] got around the
system'.  Mr Walters told Mr Star a similar story.  That
Mr Wright departed
from his own professional standards is strong evidence, I accept, of
negligence.
<P>

(vi)	In December 1994, Trans-pac committed a major breach of its factoring
arrangements.  [See Mr Wright's statement paragraphs
80-86]  Mr Bonvino was not
told (save in bland generalities which conveyed nothing of the true seriousness
of the situation).  No
special care was thereafter taken with Trans-pac by Mr
Wright.
<P>

(vii)	In February 1995, Trans-pac told Mr Wright that it needed advances
against invoices to pay its wages.  Mr Bonvino was not
at a meeting which
discussed any such proposal.
<P>

(viii)	In September - October 1995, both Mr Bonvino and Mr Kull raised with Mr
Wright the unsatisfactory way that Mr Walters was
performing.  Mr Wright
defended Mr Walters and said (falsely) that he had it under control and did
nothing to investigate the reasons
for their dissatisfaction.
<P>

(ix)	On 24 October 1995, the directors of CODFA and Cashflow resolved that
(inter alia) risk management procedures would be updated
and reviewed to reduce
default, and that a separate person would be employed to do this task.  They
also resolved that an additional
accountant would be employed if Mr Walters was
unable to keep up.  It appears that Mr Wright did nothing to implement these
resolutions.
<P>

(x)	At the pre-Christmas meeting in December 1995, Mr Wright, I accept, gave a
specific undertaking that he would make sure that
in future there were proper
First Schedules and appropriate fees charged to the clients.  That undertaking
on the evidence was not
adhered to.
<P>

(xi)	The reconstruction of the account of Trans-pac, which Mr Bonvino carried
out (after deleting the various entries which were
false), showed
understatements, in the monthly statements, of the total amount owing on the
Trans-pac account of the following amounts:
<P>

<i>	</i>	<b>Date			Dollars</b>
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/6/95			10,310.00
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/7/95			140,000.00
<P>

<i>	</i>	2/8/95			178,253.39
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/9/95			180,000.00
<P>

<i>	</i>	3/10/95		306,393.60
<P>

<i>	</i>	6/11/95		360,000.00
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/12/95		260,000.00
<P>

<i>	</i>	2/1/96			409,539.80
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/2/96			519,499.80
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/3/96			579,999.80
<P>

<i>	</i>	2/4/96			696,379.77
<P>

<i>	</i>	1/5/96			682,313.75
<P>

<i>	</i>	30/6/96		750,713.01
<P>

<i>	</i>The pattern shown here, I accept, is of steady increase in the amount
outstanding over a period of more than a year and is indicative,
I accept, of a
lack of controls.
<P>

(xii)	Many of the cheque butts of Cashflow were blank.  There were
irregularities in the cheques, such as that the notation on the
cheque butt did
not accord with the payee or recipient of the relevant cheques.  This is also
indicative of a lack of controls.
<P>

(xiii)	That Mr Wright permitted money to be paid to Trans-pac when there were
no debts identified in First Schedules is, I accept,
a departure from the
fundamental basis on which the business of Cashflow was to be conducted.
<P>

(xiv)	Mr Wright never checked the source documents to verify the authenticity
of cheques that Mr Walters presented to him, and signed
cheques when there was
no proper paperwork.
<P>

(xv)	Mr Wright signed cheques in blank.
<P>

(xvi)	Mr Wright signed photocopies of cheques, after the original of the cheque
had already been delivered to a client.  There were
numerous cheques
(identified in schedule 1 in proceedings 50111 of 1997), issued on the Cashflow
bank account that had only one signature.
 Those cheques were paid by the Bank
despite not being in accord with the authority given to the Bank.
<P>

(xvii)	The whole history of what was referred to in the Cashflow submissions as
the "Walters' unauthorised payments", went on with
Mr Wright being oblivious to
it.  This, I accept, is res ipsa loquitur of negligence.
<P>

(xviii)	The proper practice in factoring is described by Mr Maudsley.  Mr
Wright did not adhere to it.
<P>

(xix)	Trans-pac was only one of Cashflow's clients which was not required to
deliver invoices for debts which were factored.  In
this role, Mr Wright
departed from his own usual standards.
<P>

(xx)	Mr Wright admitted to Mr Bonvino that he had `made a mistake' about
signing cheques when there was no proper paperwork.
<P>

(xxi)	Notwithstanding the representations of expertise and responsibility made
to Mr Bonvino, Mr Wright in fact, I accept on the
evidence, is shown to have
left the whole operation of the factoring to Mr Walters and not to have checked
up on him at all.  Mr
Star's interview with Mr Wright records `Peter advised
that his initial involvement would be to basically sell the finance and then
when he'd done that he would had it over to Ed who would handle the day to day
management of the account and the only reason the
file would come back to Peter
in any way was to make any of the hard decisions on changing the original deal
that was set up'.
<P>

(xxii)	At no time did Mr Wright have anyone from outside come in to check the
systems in operation at Cashflow, or do an audit at
Cashflow.
<P>

(xxiii)	Mr Wright had never had an auditor go out to look at the customers of
Cashflow - to review their book of debtors, and their
financial statements and
financial data.
<P>

(xxiv)	When Trans-pac was taken on as a client, very little financial data was
sought by Cashflow.  There were no previous financial
statements, such as
profit and loss accounts and balance sheets obtained.
<P>

(xxv)	Mr Wright, on the evidence, permitted the usual checks to lapse, in the
case of Trans-pac (such as the First Schedules).
<P>

(xxvi)	Mr Burkett says that Mr Wright was often absent from the office from
about November 1994.  Mr Walters says `It was not uncommon
for Peter [Wright]
to go to lunch and then not return'.
<P>

(xxvii)	Mr Walters attributed the problems to `weakness in the internal
controls in the first instance'.
<P>

359	I accept that Cashflow's damages proven against Mr Wright, include the
following:
<P>

	(i)	The payments made to CODFA as part of the Walters' unauthorised payments.
These total $772,172 within one year of the Relation
Back Day, and $1,060,641
in total [See Exhibit GMG 4].
<P>

(ii)	The payments made to Trans-pac No. 1 (some of which were made after
Trans-pac No. 1 had ceased to trade, and therefore were
really made to
Trans-pac No. 2) and which have not been recovered.  These totalled
$2,560,134.84 as at 31 March 1998 and $4,045,732.77
as at 28 February 1999.
<P>

(iii)	The dividends which were wrongly paid totalling $105,430.
<P>

(iv)	The excess fees paid to Mr Walters and to Factors, and the excess office
services fee paid to CODFA.  The excess fees (arising
from Trans-pac
transactions) total $29,693.99 in management fees paid to Factors over the two
years of the 1995 and 1996 financial
years, plus $56,991.88 fees paid to
Walters &amp; Associates.  The excess office service fees paid to CODFA are
dealt with below.
<P>

(v)	Fees which would have been chargeable to Trans-pac (or an alternative
solvent client) if the money had been advanced correctly.
 This is included in
the total calculation of the amount owing on Trans-pac's account referred to in
(ii) above.  It is relevant
to the claim for fees that the evidence proves that
there was continuing demand for factoring, during the time that Cashflow was
operating.
<P>

(vi)	Interest paid on the loans to Pyrafount and other investors in Cashflow
which accrues while there is no income from which to
pay it.  This item is
capable of being calculated from Annexure `B' to Mr Bonvino's affidavit dated
11 March 1999.  Cashflow accepts
that if either the amount of the Trans-pac
debtors is allowed on the basis that fees that accrued are included, or the
damages include
an item for the fees which would have been earned if Cashflow's
funds had been invested with a solvent client, no separate damages
can be
claimed under this item.
<P>

(vii)	Loss of the value of the goodwill of the business.  This is valued by Mr
Cachia at $769,018.
<P>

(viii)	Costs of the liquidation.  Up to 31 January 1999 the costs totalled
$227,069.70 and the disbursements an additional $35,119.51.
<P>

(ix)	It is further necessary for a calculation to be made of section 94
interest on the damages.  That calculation can only be performed
once these
reasons for judgment become available.
<P>

<i>	</i><b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> Statutory Claims Against Mr Wright by
Cashflow</b>
<P>

360	I accept Cashflow's submission that on the evidence, Mr Wright is shown to
have made representations to Mr Bonvino that:
<P>

	(a)	the monthly accounts of Cashflow for the 1995-1996 year were correct;
<P>

(b)	advances were being made to Trans-pac No. 1 in accordance with the
factoring deed;
<P>

(c)	the Trans-pac account was in good order.
<P>

361	The representation about the monthly accounts of Cashflow for the 1995-1996
year being correct, is implied from the conduct
of Mr Wright in putting forward
the accounts for acceptance and discussion, and from the regular statements
that the accounts showed
that `we are making good money'.  Mr Wright agrees
that the records provided to Mr Bonvino each month (which included the
accounts)
were discussed for `an hour to two hours' each time.
<P>

362	The representation that the Trans-pac account was in good order, was
made:
<P>

	(a)	by conduct following the conversation between Mr Wright and Mr Bonvino
(prior to Trans-pac being taken on as a client), when
Mr Wright assured Mr
Bonvino that everything would be in order and said nothing subsequently about
it not being in order;
<P>

(b)	by conduct following the pre-Christmas meeting of 1995 - when Mr Wright had
given an undertaking to make sure that the account
was brought back in order,
and said nothing subsequently about it not being in order;
<P>

(c)	by Mr Wright by express representation that the account was in order, in
the period soon after the pre-Christmas meeting.
<P>

363	The representation about advances being made in accordance with the
factoring deed is by conduct, following the early statement
by Mr Wright about
the essential nature of a First Schedule, and following the undertaking given
at the pre-Christmas meeting.
<P>

364	I accept Cashflow's submission that these representations were misleading
and deceptive.  I accept that it is irrelevant whether
or not Mr Wright
intended to mislead or deceive and that it is irrelevant whether or not Mr
Wright was negligent in making the representations.
<P>

365	Mr Bonvino, on the evidence, relied on these representations by:
<P>

	(i)	continuing to cause Pyrafount to advance funds to Cashflow.  Pyrafount was
owed $1,420,000 as at June 1995.  It's loan to Cashflow
increased to $1,620,000
in February 1996 and then to $1,752,000 in May 1996;
<P>

(ii)	inducing other persons to advance funds to Cashflow;
<P>

(iii)	not himself investigating the books and records of Cashflow until August
1996;
<P>

(iv)	approving the payment of dividends and fees in respect of the financial
year ended 30 June 1995 as a director of Cashflow;
<P>

(v)	allowing Cashflow to continue to trade.
<P>

366	The loan account of Pyrafount with Cashflow, I accept, shows that advances
continued to be made by Pyrafount up to 3 May 1996.
 It continues to accrue
interest.
<P>

367	In the result, Cashflow I accept, has suffered loss and damage.  The same
heads of damage are relied upon by Cashflow in its
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></i>
statutory claim as for the other claims against Mr Wright.
<P>

	<b>Corporations Law Statutory Claims by Cashflow against Mr Wright</b>
<P>

368	Section 232(4) of the Corporations Law requires:
<P>

	<i>`. . .  an officer to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a
reasonable person in a like position in a corporation would
exercise in the
corporations circumstances.'</i>
<P>

369	The payments by Cashflow to CODFA which are part of the Walters'
unauthorised payments, the payments by Cashflow to Trans-pac
No. 1, the
dividends paid to $105,430, and the fees paid of $113,800, were I accept, all
transactions which Cashflow entered into
in breach of Mr Wright's obligations
under section 232(4).
<P>

370	Cashflow has pleaded a claim against Mr Wright under section 588(G) of the
Corporations Law.  All the damage that would be recoverable
under that cause of
action is recoverable by Cashflow under other causes of action against Mr
Wright.  In the interests of simplifying
the trial Cashflow did not make
separate submissions concerning that cause of action.  Cashflow sought, if Mr
Wright would seek to
make the cause of action relevant to the proceedings at
any later time, to reserve the right to argue that Mr Wright is in fact liable
under this cause of action as well as under the other causes of action pleaded
against him.
<P>

	<b>Jones and Dunkel and Mr Wright</b>
<P>

371	It is possible to reach a conclusion on the liability of Mr Wright without
any resort to Jones v Dunkel.  He is liable for the
full amount claimed.
<P>

	<b>Holding as to Cashflow's Contractual Claim Against Factors</b>
<P>

372	There was, I accept, a Management Agreement (`the Cashflow Management
Agreement') between Factors and Cashflow.  It was not
in writing.  It was a
term of each agreement that the services supplied under it would be supplied
honestly, and that the services
would be competently and professionally given
with due care and skill.  The actions of Mr Wright are shown on the evidence to
constitute
a breach of that term.  Factors is liable for the same damages that
Mr Wright is liable for.  The loss, however, that arises from
having advanced
money to Trans-pac ought be calculated so as to put Cashflow into the position
it would have been in if the contract
had been performed.  That includes the
fees that accrue due on the Trans-pac account from time to time.  Thus the
amount to be allowed
in relation to the Trans-pac loan is $4,045,732.77.
<P>

	<b>Holding as to Cashflow's Personal Claims Against Mr Walters</b>
<P>

373	I accept that Mr Walters owed a duty of care arising from undertaking the
task of providing accountancy services to Cashflow,
acting as an authorised
signatory to the bank account, and acting as a secretary of Cashflow, and that
as secretary that he had fiduciary
duties and statutory duties.
<P>

374	The authority that Mr Walters had was to carry out the paperwork in
accordance with the factoring agreement for the ordinary
operation of the
factoring.  He did not have authority to make advances to Trans-pac on any
basis other than purchase of identified
debts, listed in a First Schedule, for
money drawn from the Cashflow account.  He did not have authority to make
payments to Trans-pac
without a `sign-off' from Mr Wright.  He did not have
authority to `borrow' money of Cashflow and CODFA, one from another.
<P>

375	The release of the two mortgages from the Panayis was, I accept,  carried
out by a forgery of the signature of Mr Wright on
each of the discharges and by
a use of the Company's seal without authority.  That was a breach.  I accept
the unchallenged evidence
adduced against Mr Walters, of Mr S. Dubedat, as
reliable.  Mr Dubedat is a handwriting expert with considerable experience in
forensic
document examination who had worked with the New South Wales Police
Service for 15 years.  His evidence was that there were significant
differences
between Mr Wright's signatures on specimen documents [in fact signed by Mr
Wright] and the signatures on the copies of
Discharges of Mortgages 2281090W
and 2233324U purporting to be those of Mr Wright.  I am satisfied on the
evidence that Cashflow
has discharged the necessary onus required to establish
that Mr Walters wrongfully facilitated the discharge of the two mortgages
by
the unauthorised execution of those discharges for which Cashflow received no
benefit.
<P>

	[As to onus, I note that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s140.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 140(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i>

361-362 (see <i>Pedler v Richardson</i> (unreported, Supreme Court of New South
Wales, 16 October 1997, Young J) at 10-11.]
<P>

376	The making of the Walters' unauthorised payments was also a breach.
<P>

377	Each of the matters set out in paragraph 46 of the amended cross claim was,
I accept, a further breach.
<P>

378	The value of the security that was obtained from the Panayis was in the
range of $650,000 to $700,000.
<P>

379	The effect of Mr Walters' falsification of the books and presentation of
false annual and monthly statements of accounts was,
I accept, to cause the
payment of the dividend, overpayment of fees by Cashflow and continuation of
the business at a time when if
the true situation had been known, the losses
would have been stopped, and further losses not incurred.
<P>

380	I accept that it was prior to December 1995 that Mr Walters began to make
advances to Trans-pac without a First Schedule, and
tried to reconcile the
amounts at the end of the month.  Mr Walters admitted on 12 August 1996, that
he had been `lying and deceitful
for the past year and a half at least'.  He
admitted that he had falsified the accounts of Cashflow as at 30 June 1995.  He
admitted
that since the end of the previous financial year, he had been making
advances to Trans-pac without First Schedules and without following
procedures.
He admitted that all the problems were in Trans-pac's account and that the
extent of the shortfall that Cashflow would
suffer would be about $1.16million.
In fact his admission underestimated the actual loss.  He made a similar
admission in the weeks
after 12 August.
<P>

381	At the pre-Christmas meeting in December 1995, Mr Walters gave a specific
undertaking that he would require First Schedules
before making advances to
Trans-pac.  He did not adhere to that undertaking.
<P>

382	I accept that the dealings with Trans-pac were such a shambles that Mr
Peter Panayi told Mr Star that the money that Cashflow
paid to Trans-pac
`weren't factoring the debtors.  Peter didn't know what they were for'.
<P>

383	I accept Cashflow's submission that the losses caused by the conduct of Mr
Walters in respect of which Cashflow is entitled
to recover are the same
amounts as Mr Wright is liable for, in short:
<P>

	(i)	Payment of $772,172 to CODFA.
<P>

(ii)	All payments made by Cashflow to Trans-pac No. 1 and Trans-pac No. 2 and
not recovered.
<P>

(iii)	Fees which would have been chargeable to Trans-pac (or an alternative
solvent client) if the money had been advanced correctly.
<P>

(iv)	Interest paid on the loans to Pyrafount and other investors in Cashflow
which accrues while there is no income from which to
pay it.
<P>

(v)	Dividends paid of $105,430.
<P>

(vi)	Fees overpaid to Walters and Factors.
<P>

(vii)	Loss of the benefit of the mortgages over the Panayi properties.
<P>

(viii)	Loss of the value of the goodwill of the business.
<P>

(ix)	Costs of the liquidation.
<P>

	As to the office services fee, this is dealt with below and submissions as to
how this matter falls to be treated with will be
invited from the parties at
the same time as Short Minutes are to be brought in.
<P>

384	I accept Cashflow's submission that a very significant admission of
liability made by Mr Walters is that he authorised CODFA
to appropriate his
loan account, in the sum of approximately $150,000, in reduction of the amounts
transferred by him from the bank
account of the company to Trans-pac Australia
Pty Limited.
<P>

	<b>Holding as to Cashflow's <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> Claim Against Mr Walters</b>
<P>

385	I accept that Mr Walters is shown on the evidence to have represented to Mr
Bonvino that:
<P>

	(i)	the monthly accounts of Cashflow for the 1995-1996 year were correct;
<P>

(ii)	advances were being made to Trans-pac No. 1 in accordance with the
factoring deed;
<P>

(iii)	the Trans-pac account was in good order.
<P>

386	The representations as to the monthly accounts was made by presenting the
accounts for approval and discussion.
<P>

387	The representation that the advances were being made in accordance with the
factoring deed and that the Trans-pac account was
in good order, arose from the
whole course of his conduct.  In particular, his silence after the
pre-Christmas meeting of 1995, makes
it all the easier to conclude that he was
making that representation.
<P>

388	The representations made by Mr Walters were misleading and deceptive.  They
were made in trade and commerce.
<P>

389	The representations were relied upon by Mr Bonvino, I accept, as pleaded in
paragraph 36 of the amended cross claim.
<P>

390	If those representations had not been made, I accept that it is likely that
Mr Bonvino would have discovered the errors and
that there would have been no
payment of dividend or fees for the year ended 30 June 1995, nor any loss of
capital or unauthorised
transactions would have occurred after that date.
<P>

391	Cashflow makes a separate claim that the conduct of Mr Walters, identified
in paragraph 46 of the statement of claim, was misleading
and deceptive and
caused loss.  I accept that these are, by no means, `make weight' claims.
While they are not founded on representations,
I accept that there is no
requirement that breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42</a> take the form of a misrepresentation.
These separate claims recognise what I accept was a reality, namely that it was
the secrecy
and deception of Mr Walters which is the cause of the downflow of
Cashflow.
<P>

	<b>Holding as to Contractual Claim of Cashflow Against Walters &amp;
Associates</b>
<P>

392	I accept that an Accounting Agreement (`the Cashflow Accounting Agreement')
is shown to have been entered into between Mr Walters
carrying on business as
`Walters &amp; Associates' and Cashflow.  The agreement was that in
consideration of the accounting services
provided by Walters &amp; Associates
to Cashflow, Cashflow and/or its clients paid a fee of 10% of factoring fees
earned by Cashflow
from the operation of its business.  I accept that it had a
term that the services supplied under it would be supplied honestly and
the
services would be competently and professionally given with due care and skill.
The making of the Walters' unauthorised payments
was, I accept, a breach.
<P>

393	Cashflow does not seek to submit that anyone other than Mr Walters
personally, carried on practice as Walters &amp; Associates.
<P>

394	The measure of damages for breach of contract, I accept, is the difference
between the situation that Cashflow is now in and
the situation it would have
been in if the contract had been performed.
<P>

395	The loss that has been suffered, I accept, includes the amount of the
Trans-pac debt to Cashflow.  None of the debtors of Trans-pac
have been
recovered.  The winding up of Trans-pac No. 1 is complete with a nil return to
creditors.  No amount has yet, I accept,
been recovered under the one remaining
mortgage.  Thus I accept that the judgment in favour of Cashflow should have
the full amount
of Trans-pac's debt as one element included in it.
<P>

396	I accept that in addition, the damages suffered by Cashflow include the
costs of the liquidation and the value of the goodwill
of the business which
has been lost.
<P>

397	I accept that all the other items recoverable on a tort or <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading
Act</a></i> basis of recovery against Mr Wright are also recoverable on the
contractual claim.
<P>

	<b>Jones v Dunkel and Mr Walters</b>
<P>

398	I note Cashflow's submission that Mr Walters has preferred the well of the
Court to the witness box.  In addition, I note that
after coming to Court and
announcing an intention to cross-examine Mr Bonvino and that he had prepared
four pages of notes, Mr Walters
informed the Court that he had decided that `my
four pages of notes would only hinder myself if I was to cross-examine, so I
prefer
not to'.  Each of these is, I accept, a significant admission of the
weakness or absence of Mr Walters having a case.
<P>

	<b>An Overview of CODFA's Case Against Cashflow</b>
<P>

399	CODFA's case is presented at a number of levels.  It's central submission
is that in a practical sense Cashflow's claims to
recover moneys from CODFA
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> Corporations Law are irrelevant.  This is, so CODFA submits,
because Cashflow at all material times had a liability, as a fiduciary,
to
account to CODFA and to restore to CODFA, with interest, money said to have
been `stolen' from CODFA and such benefits or profits
as Cashflow may have
obtained from those moneys.  Hence, even if CODFA was by a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> order to
be required to refund any moneys to Cashflow, Cashflow's equitable obligation
to account to CODFA for those moneys is said
to result in a like amount being
held on trust by Cashflow for CODFA.  CODFA at one of a number of levels seeks
to invoke the principles
pursuant to which it is suggested that a constructive
trust may be imposed by remedial order of the Court.  CODFA emphasises that
it
is not seeking to trace funds through Cashflow.   Cashflow's liability is put
as that of a fiduciary to account to CODFA.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Pleading against Cashflow</b>
<P>

400	CODFA pleads against Cashflow in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`<b>CLAIMS AGAINST CASHFLOW</b></i>
<P>

<i>	24.	<b>Restitution</b></i>
<P>

<i>	The paid funds were paid to or on account of Cashflow (as alleged in
paragraph 21 hereof) without the authority of CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>Particulars</b></i>
<P>

<center><i>	The payments were not authorised by the directors of CODFA and
there was no commercial purpose for the payment of the funds by
CODFA.</i></center>

funds.</i>
<P>

<i>	26.	Cashflow obtained the benefit of the paid funds.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>Particulars</b></i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>a.	The funds:</i>

<i>	(i)	permitted Cashflow to make payments to Cashflow clients;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	directly discharged debts of Cashflow to Cashflow's clients.</i>
<P>

<i>b.	Cashflow received part of the paid funds (namely, the total amount of
$568,767.00 listed in the "Cashflow" column of Schedule 1
to this claim)

<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Cashflow:</i>

<i>(b)	adopted or otherwise ratified the use of the funds insofar as they
directly discharged debts of Cashflow to Cashflow's clients.</i>

of the funds, and profits thereon, without making restitution
to CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Cashflow should account to CODFA for the paid funds, the benefit of the
paid funds, and the profits Cashflow has made by use of
the paid funds.</i>
<P>

<b><i>CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST</i></b><i>  . . . </i>
<P>

<i>	31.	Further or alternatively to paragraphs 21 to 30 hereof (inclusive)
CODFA pleads as set out in paragraphs [sic] to 32J hereof
(inclusive.</i>
<P>

<i>	32.	CODFA repeats the allegations and each of the allegations contained
in:</i>
<P>

<i>	a.	Paragraph 21 hereof (to the effect that Walters caused funds, designated
"the paid funds," of CODFA to be paid to Cashflow or
clients of
Cashflow).</i>
<P>

<i>b.	Paragraph 24 hereof (to the effect that the paid funds were paid to or on
account of Cashflow without the authority of CODFA).</i>
<P>

<i>c.	Paragraph 25 hereof (to the effect that no consideration passed to CODFA
or from Cashflow from the paid funds).</i>
<P>

<i>d.	Paragraph 26 hereof (to the effect that Cashflow obtained the benefit of
the paid funds).</i>
<P>

<i>e.	Paragraph 27 hereof (to the effect that Cashflow either actually or

funds in its factoring arrangements, generated, and has
retained, profits from
those funds).</i>
<P>

<i>g.	Paragraph 29 hereof (to the effect that Cashflow has not accounted to
CODFA for the paid funds or such benefits and profits as
it may have obtained
from the paid funds).</i>
<P>

<i>	32A	Save to the extent (if at all) payments of "the received funds" pleaded
in paragraph 22 are properly attributed to (or adopted
by) Cashflow, Cashflow
has not accounted to CODFA for (or restored to CODFA) the paid funds or such
benefits and profits as it may
have obtained from the paid funds.</i>
<P>

<i>	32B	When the paid funds were paid to Cashflow or clients of Cashflow
without the authority of CODFA as alleged in paragraphs 21 and
24 hereof, and
at such other times as may be material, </i><cite>Cashflow knew</cite><i>
that:</i>
<P>

<i>	a.	The paid funds were the property of CODFA</i>
<P>

<i>b.	The payments were without any consideration passing to CODFA or from
Cashflow</i>
<P>

<i>c.	The payments were in breach of duties owed by Walters to CODFA</i>
<P>

<i>Particulars</i>
<P>

<center><i>	The knowledge of Cashflow is imputed from the circumstance that
Walters was an officer of Cashflow, Cashflow had delegated to Walters
the day
to day management of its business affairs and handling of moneys received, and
Walters applied the paid funds (for the benefit
of Cashflow) by payment to or
on account of Cashflow.</i></center>
<P>

<i>32C	Further or alternatively to paragraph 32B hereof, </i><cite>Cashflow
knew</cite><i> the facts and each of the facts alleged in the sub-paragraphs of
paragraph 32B no later than 12 August 1996 or thereabouts:</i>
<P>

<i>	Particulars</i>
<P>

<center><i>	On or about 12 August 1996 Walters reported to Mr Anthony Bonvino
and Mr Peter Wright (directors of Cashflow) each of the facts
alleged.</i></center>
<P>

<i>32D	On or about 19 December 1996 Cashflow (by its liquidator, Mr J E Star)
undertook to the Court and CODFA in these proceedings that
it would set aside,
and did set aside, a sum of $200,000.00 as security for the purpose of the
relief claimed by CODFA against Cashflow
in the proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>	32E	Further and alternatively to paragraph 32B and 32C hereof, CODFA says
that, with knowledge of the facts and each of the facts
alleged in the
sub-paragraphs of paragraph 32B hereof;</i>
<P>

<i>	a.	Cashflow retained (and continues to retain) the paid funds, and such
benefits and profits as it may have obtained from the paid
funds.</i>
<P>

<i>b.	Further and alternatively to sub-paragraph (a), Cashflow refused (or,
alternatively failed) to account to CODFA for (or to restore
to CODFA	) the
paid funds when, on or about 5 September 1996, it was called upon by CODFA to
do so.</i>
<P>

<i>	Particulars</i>
<P>

<center><i>	i.	by a letter of demand dated 5 September 1996 addressed to
Cashflow, CODFA demanded that Cashflow pay to it the amount of $180,000.00
pleaded in paragraph 23 hereof.</i></center>
<P>

<i>ii.	Cashflow has not paid, or agreed to pay, any part of that amount.</i>
<P>

<i>iii.	Further, by its Cross Claim in these proceedings, Cashflow has claimed
an entitlement (allegedly under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> of the Corporations Law) to recover
some of the received funds, from CODFA with interest.</i>
<P>

<i>c.	Further and alternatively to sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) on 15 March 1999
Cashflow in these proceedings:</i>
<P>

<i>	i.	Formally admitted that it had received a benefit from each of the paid
funds other than the payment of $20,000.00 itemised as
payment number 19 in
Schedule 1 to this claim ("the admitted payments").</i>
<P>

<i>ii.	Formally admitted that it has a restitutionary obligation to repay each
of the admitted payments to CODFA</i>
<P>

<i>	III.	Formally admitted that that restitutionary obligation came into
existence immediately upon the making of each of the admitted
payments as
alleged in paragraphs 21 and 24 hereof.</i>
<P>

<i>	Particulars</i>
<P>

<center><i>	The admissions were made by senior counsel for Cashflow at page 30

paid funds were paid
to Cashflow or clients of Cashflow without the authority of CODFA as alleged in
paragraphs 21 and 24 hereof
(and continuing up to and including the present

<P>

<i>	a.	Cashflow was (and remains) liable, as a fiduciary, to account to CODFA
for (and to restore to CODFA) the paid funds and such benefits

(inclusive) and 32
hereof, from a time no later than 15 March 1999 or thereabouts (and continuing

<i>b.	To which a constructive trust in favour of CODFA attached (or,
alternatively, can and ought to attach by an order of the Court)
for payment of
the paid funds and such benefits and profits as Cashflow may have obtained from
the paid funds.</i>
<P>

<i>32J	By reason of the facts and circumstances pleased [sic] in paragraphs 32F

(or, alternatively, ought
to be ordered to hold on trust for CODFA) an amount equal to the sum of the
paid funds and such benefits
and profits as Cashflow may have obtained from the
paid funds.'</i>
<P>

401	CODFA also addressed detailed submissions as to the claims of Cashflow and
of Mr Star under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> Corporations Law.  CODFA's final submissions sought
to emphasise the following CODFA analysis:
<P>

<i>`[I]	(a)	It is common ground between Cashflow and CODFA that, if CODFA's
claimed entitlement to equitable relief is upheld, there
is no practical scope
for an application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> in Cashflow's favour.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The purpose of the Corporations Law is in no way to allow, or to assist,
a company to retain stolen moneys or, more generally,
to circumvent its
fiduciary obligations.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The starting and end point of Mr Star's claim on behalf of Cashflow is
section 588FF(1).</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	That section clearly requires an exercise of discretion:  Re Pacific
Hardware Brokers (Qld) Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2015%20ACLC%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 15 ACLC 442</a> at 447.</i>
<P>

<i>	Even if all pre-conditions of section 588FF are satisfied (which CODFA
disputes) it would be an improper exercise of discretion to
grant relief under
the section to Cashflow in light of Cashflow's fiduciary obligation to account
to CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Even if other pre-conditions of an order under section 588FF(1) have
been made out by Cashflow (which is disputed), section 588FG(2)
precludes any
grant of relief to Cashflow.    There is no basis upon which the Court can find
otherwise than that CODFA received
payments from Cashflow in good faith, with
no reasonable grounds for suspecting that Cashflow was insolvent (if it was
insolvent),
in circumstances in which CODFA had provided valuable consideration
for Cashflow's payments.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	Insofar as Cashflow seeks to recover its part repayments of stolen
moneys by reliance upon an allegation of "unfair preferences",
section 588FA(3)
requires that the "unauthorized running account" be taken as a whole.   Section
588FA is not confined to formal
running accounts; the Court must analyse, and
characterize, what in fact occurred between the parties and not merely what (if
anything)
the respective parties intended or agreed.</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	Insofar as Cashflow seeks to recover moneys on the basis of
"uncommercial transactions", section 588FB requires it to recognize
that it had
a positive obligation both to repay the moneys stolen from CODFA and to pay
CODFA for a share of their joint office expenses.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is no reasonable basis upon which either obligation can be
characterized as one in which "it may be expected that a reasonable
person in a
company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction".   There
was nothing unreasonable about any relevant
"transaction".  On the contrary, it
would be unreasonable for Cashflow not to have met its obligations.</i>
<P>

<i>	[II]	On the evidence adduced in the proceedings, reinforced by the manner
in which Cashflow has conducted its case, section 588FG(2)
provides a complete
answer to all of Cashflow's claims under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> (in general) and section
588FF (in particular).   This is because:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Each of the elements in section 588FG(2) must be taken as having been
established in favour of CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The law as to the meaning of "good faith" and "valuable consideration"
was considered in P T Garuda Indonesia Ltd v Grellman <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/188.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCAFC 188</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2035%20FCR%20515" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 35 FCR 515</a> at 528
and 530-532;, although the Court's attention was there directed to sections
120-121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1986 (Cth), the
same principles have application
to section 588FG(2): Ford's Principles of Corporations Law, paragraph
[27.270].</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the Court must find that CODFA became a party to "the unauthorized
inter-company payments" and the "office expenses agreements",
and received
moneys pursuant to those transactions, "in good faith".    There is no basis
upon which it can be said that CODFA was
"privy to the fraud of Mr Walters and
Cashflow".     See </i><cite>Garuda</cite><i> at 528.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Walters' fraud cannot be attributed in any way to CODFA.  Cashflow have
not suggested that either Mr Kull or Mr Wright knew of
the fraud.   Nor did it
cross examine Mr Kull to impugn his good faith or that of CODFA
generally.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	There is no basis upon which it can be said that CODFA or any reasonable
person in CODFA's circumstances, should have suspected
that Cashflow was
insolvent (if indeed it was insolvent).   </i>
<P>

<i>CODFA was not privy to false entries in Cashflow's books.  Cashflow's entire
case is predicated upon the contention that Mr Bonvino
himself (who was in a
position to supervise Cashflow's books and the conduct of its business) did not
suspect insolvency on the part
of Cashflow until after Mr Walters confessed to
irregularities on 12 August 1996: see ,for example, his affidavit of 5 March
1999
paragraph 18.   Even allowing for differences of opinion expressed on
either side of the record, the fact remains that there was
no suggestion of
insolvency by anybody prior to Mr Walters' confession.   On the contrary, Mr
Bonvino had undertaken to support the
company with loan funds as required.   No
ex post facto analysis of the company's solvency can retrospectively attribute
reasonable
grounds for suspicion of insolvency to CODFA.    </i>
<P>

<i>(e)	CODFA provided valuable consideration for all moneys it received from
Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>	In relation to Cashflow's part-repayments of stolen moneys, it is
established that an antecedent debt may constitute "valuable consideration"
in
the statutory context:  Garuda at 530-532.</i>
<P>

<u>	</u><i>There is no basis upon which it can be said that CODFA did not
provide valuable consideration for Cashflow's payments of office expenses.
Office facilities were shared by Cashflow.    The fact that Cashflow has since
rewritten its books, to reflect its contention that
it did not in fact
ultimately receive the quantum of fees it earlier represented to CODFA (through
its accounts), provides no occasion
for a finding that CODFA did not "provide
valuable consideration under the transaction".   There is no basis upon which
to vary the
"accounts stated" between the parties on their settlement of
liability for shared office expenses.'</i>
<P>

402	CODFA also addressed detailed submissions in support of:
<P>

	(a)	Its claim against Mr Star for recovery of office expenses of $6,050.
<P>

<i>(</i>b)	It's claim against Cashflow for recovery of office expenses of
$4,344.68.
<P>

(c)	It's defence to Mr Star's claim for $17,203 said to have been an
overpayment of office service fees by Cashflow to CODFA during
the financial
years ended 30 June 1995 and June 1996.
<P>

403	The Court's findings as to Part 5.7B and it's application to the facts
proven are set out below.
<P>

404	It is convenient to next deal with CODFA's detailed submissions relating to
Cashflow's equitable obligations.  In an important
sense, these submissions,
which seek to outflank the whole operation of Part 5.7B, form the centrepiece
of Cashflow's case.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Detailed Submissions Relating to Cashflow's Equitable
Obligations</b>
<P>

405	CODFA commences it's submissions with the following preliminary
observations:
<P>

<b><i>`Preliminary Observations</i></b>
<P>

<i>	Cashflow cannot escape the consequences of the following facts:</i>
<P>

<i>		(a)	It obtained the benefit of moneys stolen from CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The moneys were stolen from CODFA for the purpose of benefiting
Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Mr Walter's knowledge of the theft must be attributed to Cashflow
because:</i>
<P>

<i>		(i)	he was an officer of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	Cashflow had delegated to him (or, at least, acquiesced in his having)
the day-to-day management of the company's business affairs
and receipt and
disbursement of moneys; and</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	he applied CODFA's moneys (for the benefit of Cashflow) by payment to
or on account of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Even if Mr Walter's knowledge of the theft is not attributed to
Cashflow, the company has refused to account for the stolen moneys
(or any
profits or benefits derived from such moneys) at any time since Mr Walters
freely confessed the misappropriations on 12 August
1996.</i>
<P>

<i>	Cashflow's claims against CODFA, in respect of Cashflow's part repayments
of stolen moneys, are a contrived, unconscionable attempt
to retain the stolen
moneys without any proper accounting for them or for benefits derived from
them.  Not content with the retention
of stolen moneys Cashflow and Mr Star
seek to compound the theft by recovery of part repayments of the stolen
moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	The conduct of Cashflow and Mr Star in these proceedings has, on any view,
improperly forced CODFA to incur substantial, unnecessary
legal costs.</i>
<P>

<i>	Not until their opening address on 15 March 1999 did they concede that
Cashflow had (at least) a non-proprietary restitutionary obligation
to restore
stolen moneys to CODFA.    Their submission, at that time, that CODFA had a
debt which should be admitted to proof in
the winding up of the company was a
hollow gesture, made belatedly in the proceedings after substantial costs had
been incurred,
and coupled with a demand for payment of moneys in excess of the
current net balance of stolen moneys outstanding.</i>
<P>

<i>	It should be borne in mind that:  </i>
<P>

<i>(a)	by a letter dated 5 September 1996 CODFA demanded the return of its
moneys (more particularly, the balance of $180,000.00), but
its demand was not
met or acknowledged as correctly based.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	on or about 7 February 1997 CODFA lodged a proof of debt with Cashflow,
which Mr Star rejected on or about 2 May 1997:  Exhibit
"D1X" (CODFA Tender
Bundle No. 2) documents 14 and 15.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	since rejecting CODFA's proof of debt Cashflow and Mr Star have pursued
claims under Part 5.7B of the Corporations Law which are
both totally
misconceived and unconscionable.</i>
<P>

<i>	On 15 March 1999 Cashflow formally admitted in these proceedings
that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	it had received a benefit from CODFA's stolen moneys (other than in
respect of the disputed $20,000.00).</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	it has a restitutionary obligation to repay all the stolen moneys (at
least insofar as it obtained a benefit from such moneys).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	that restitutionary obligation came into existence immediately upon the
making of the admitted payments of CODFA's stolen moneys
for the benefit of
Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>The admissions were made by senior counsel for Cashflow at page 29 (lines
46-55),  page 30 (lines 31-34), page 30 (line 52-page 31
line 46) and page 59
(lines 22-44) of the transcript for 15 March 1999.</i>
<P>

<i>	CODFA stood to gain, and gained, nothing from the payment of its moneys to
or for the benefit of Cashflow (or, for that matter, to
or for the benefit of
the Transpac companies, with which only Cashflow ever had a commercial
relationship).</i>
<P>

<i>	Cashflow has not suggested, in any way, that CODFA knew or approved of Mr
Walters' misappropriations for the benefit of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>	In his evidence, Mr Kull (the principal person behind CODFA) denied that he
knew anything about the misappropriations: Exhibit "D1A"
paragraphs 75-82.  He
was not cross examined to suggest otherwise.</i>
<P>

<i>	Nor has Cashflow suggested that knowledge of Mr Walters' misappropriations
could be attributed to CODFA through knowledge of Mr Wright,
Mr Kull's
co-director of CODFA.   In Cashflow's opening address senior counsel for the
company accepted "that Mr Wright was oblivious
to the unauthorized payments
which Mr Walters was making [between Cashflow and CODFA] until the very end":
transcript page 28 (lines

<P>

<i>	Although it may be accepted that the directors of Cashflow (Mr Bonvino and
Mr Wright) did not in fact know of Mr Walters' misappropriations
until 12
August 1996, Mr Walters' contemporaneous knowledge of the misappropriations
</i><cite>must</cite><i> be attributed to Cashflow because:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	he was at all times an officer (company secretary) of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the directors had acquiesced in his having the conduct of the business
of Cashflow on a day-to-day basis (in the course of which
he not only provided
accountancy services but also attended to banking, and the drawing of cheques
and dealings with clients, including
the Transpac companies).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	whether formally authorized by Cashflow or not, Mr Walters'
misappropriations of CODFA's moneys were, in intendment and in fact
for the
benefit of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the payments were made in the hope that business would be generated for
Cashflow:  Mr Campbell QC, final submissions.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Bonvino may complain that Messrs Wright and Walters breached their
obligations to Cashflow.    The fact remains, however, that
he and Mr Wright
acquiesced in Mr Walters' active management of the company.</i>
<P>

	<i>According to the principles developed from Lennards Carrying Co Ltd v

"directing mind and will" of Cashflow in relation to the company's day-to-day
receipts and disbursements.
   This is because he was the natural person having
management and control of the business of the company in relation to the
particular
conduct in point:   Ed Ajou v Dollar Land Holding plc <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1993/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] EWCA Civ 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20All%20ER%20685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 All

any suggestion that Mr Walters' dishonesty
precludes an attribution of his

and the additional cases referred to in
K. Mason and J.W. Carter, Restitution Law in Australia (1995) paragraph [1633],
in footnote
162.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is not necessary for CODFA to establish the existence of a fiduciary
relationship between itself and any person (such as Mr Walters,
Mr Wright or
Cashflow) independently of the fiduciary obligations arising from the theft of
its moneys.   As noted in R.P. Meagher
and W.M.C. Gummow, Jacobs' Law of Trusts
in Australia (6th edition, 1997) paragraph [1310], the thefts of CODFA's moneys
were sufficient
of themselves both to establish a fiduciary obligation and to
constitute a breach of the obligation.   Further, as noted by Macpherson
ACJ in
Puma Australia Pty Ltd v Sportsman's Australia Ltd (No 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20Qd%20R%20159" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] Qd R. 159</a> at
163-164, insofar as Re Diplock [1948] Ch 464 held that a fiduciary relation was
needed to sustain a following or tracing in equity,
it cannot stand with the
decisions of the High Court in Black and Creak which his Honour, independently
of their binding authority,
endorsed as correct.</i>
<P>

<i>	It should not go unnoticed, however, that, independently of any fiduciary
obligation arising from his misappropriations, Mr Walters
did owe, and by his
misappropriations breach, duties to CODFA as an officer of the company.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whether or not Mr Bonvino knew or approved of Cashflow's receipt of, and
dealing with, CODFA's moneys, the objective facts are that
Cashflow did receive
the moneys and did deal with them to its commercial benefit.  </i>
<P>

<i>Cashflow no longer suggests that it was in any sense merely a "conduit pipe"
through which CODFA's moneys passed for the benefit on
an unrelated party.
Accordingly,  the observations of Gibbs CJ in National Commercial Banking
Corporation of Australia Ltd v Batty
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 251</a> at 268-269 (which
concerned common law principles relating to the recovery of moneys had and
received rather than to fiduciary obligations)
do not, in principle or on the
facts of this case, limit CODFA's entitlements to recovery against
Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>	With knowledge which must be imputed to Cashflow, Mr Walters applied all
the stolen moneys for the benefit of Cashflow (from which
no consideration
moved in favour of CODFA) in that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	sums totalling $568,767.00 (as summarized in Schedule 1 of CODFA's
Second Amended Statement of Claim filed on 22 March 1999 in
the proceedings
numbered 50177 of 1997) were paid directly into Cashflow's bank account;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	sums totalling a further $671,874.00 (being the sum of the total amounts
of $538,644.00, $20,000.00, $736,000.00 and $112,494.00
recorded in Schedule 1
of CODFA's Second Amended Statement of Claim) were paid to customers of
Cashflow on account of Cashflow and
Cashflow received a benefit from those
payments. </i>
<P>

<i>	By reason of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the knowledge of Mr Walters which must be imputed to Cashflow; </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	further and alternatively to (a), the knowledge acquired by other
officers of Cashflow upon or after Mr Walter's confession of
misconduct on 12
August 1996; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	further and alternatively to (a) and (b), Cashflow's receipt of the
stolen moneys (either directly or indirectly), or benefits
from those moneys,
as a volunteer,</i>
<P>

<i>Cashflow acquired, and retains, the obligations of a fiduciary to account to
CODFA for the stolen moneys and its use of the stolen
moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	Nothing turns on precisely when Cashflow became "fully aware" of its having
received CODFA's moneys.   It had that knowledge, through
Messrs Walters and
Bonvino, no later than 12 August 1996.   Even if the full ramifications of the
"unauthorized payments" did not
dawn on Mr Bonvino until much later (as to
which, see his affidavit of 27 April 1998 paragraph 52(c)) he clearly knew that
Cashflow
had received some of CODFA's moneys.   Mr Bonvino also received
CODFA's letter of demand on 5 September 1996: Affidavit paragraph
51.   In any
event, even knowledge acquired now would affect Cashflow's conscience in
equity.</i>
<P>

<i>	In response to oral submissions of Cashflow (made on 15-17 March 1999) the
following should be noted:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	CODFA is not seeking "to trace funds through Cashflow".   Cashflow has a
liability, as a fiduciary, to account to CODFA and, accordingly,
to restore to
CODFA (with interest) the moneys stolen from CODFA and such benefits or profits
as it may have obtained from those
moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	irrelevant to CODFA's claim are the questions:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	whether or not Cashflow's bank account was at any time in
overdraft.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	whether or not Cashflow was insolvent at or before the "relation back
day"  (12 September 1996) or at some other time.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	equally, the making of a winding up order against Cashflow is irrelevant
to CODFA's  claim (particularly as CODFA was granted
leave to proceed against
CODFA by an order made on 19 December 1996 in the proceedings numbered 50177 of
1997).</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	in a practical sense, Cashflow's claims to recover moneys from CODFA
under Part 5.7B of the Corporations Law are also irrelevant
because, if CODFA
is ordered to refund any money to Cashflow, Cashflow's equitable obligation to
account to Cashflow will result
in a like amount being held on trust by
Cashflow for CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>	Nothing has occurred since Cashflow received the benefit of CODFA's
misappropriated moneys (and, as it now concedes, it came under
a restitutionary
obligation towards CODFA) to relieve the company of its fiduciary obligation to
account to CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>	A fiduciary cannot be permitted to retain a profit or benefit which he has
obtained by reason of his breach of fiduciary.    A fiduciary
is liable to
account for a profit or benefit if it was obtained by reason of his fiduciary
position or his taking advantage of an
opportunity or knowledge which he
derived in consequence of his occupation of the fiduciary position.   Once it
is established that
the fiduciary is liable to account for a profit or benefit
which he has obtained there can be no objection to his being held to account
as
a constructive trustee of that profit or benefit.   It can make no difference
that it was not his duty to obtain the profit or
benefit for the person to whom
the duty was owed.   What is important is that the advantage has accrued to him
in breach of his fiduciary
duty or by his misuse of his fiduciary position.
The consequence is that he must account for it and in Equity the appropriate
remedy
is by means of a constructive trust: Hospital Products Ltd v United
States Surgical Corporation <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 41</a> at 107-108 per Mason J.</i>
<P>

<i>	The nature of the liability to account informs the quantification of the
liability.</i>
<P>

<i>	The obligation of a defaulting fiduciary is essentially a personal
obligation of effecting a restitution to the estate of his principal.
  Having
committed a breach of his fiduciary obligations, a fiduciary is liable to place
the estate in the same position as it would
have been in if no breach had been
committed.    See Re Dawson (Deceased)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%202%20NSWR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] 2 NSWR 211</a> at 214 (lines 50-54),
215 (lines 9-48) and 216 (lines 5-15).</i>
<P>

<i>	Further, where a fiduciary has, through his breach of obligations as such,
occasioned loss to his principal's estate then he is liable
to make good that
loss, together with interest: ibid page 217 (lines 30-32) and page 218 (lines
4-7).    An award of compound interest,
according to equitable principles, is
appropriate both to compensate CODFA and to minimize the possibility that
Cashflow will have
retained any profit from its breach of duty: Hagan v
Waterhouse  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2034%20NSWLR%20308" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 34 NSWLR 308</a> at 393A-E, approved in Alemite Lubrequip Pty Ltd

<P>

<i>	The appropriate course in this case is to make orders (including a
declaration that Cashflow holds moneys on trust) requiring Cashflow
to account
for $180,000.00 with interest calculated at a "mercantile rate" from the dates
(between 16 November 1994 and 19 July 1996)
when Cashflow acquired the benefit
of CODFA's moneys and continuing until such time as all such moneys are
restored to CODFA.   
An award of interest at a compound, mercantile rate would
overcome any need to conduct an inquiry as to the quantification of the
profits
and benefits received by Cashflow from its use of CODFA's moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	Cashflow has funds available to it (including, but not limited, to a sum of
$200,000.00 which, on 19 December 1996, it undertook
would be set aside as
security for the purpose of relief claimed by CODFA against Cashflow in the
proceedings):</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	from which it could, in whole or part, satisfy its obligation to account
to CODFA; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	to which a constructive trust in favour of CODFA attaches (or,
alternatively, can and ought to attach by a remedial order of the
Court) in
support of that liability to account.</i>
<P>

<i>The undertaking of Cashflow and Mr Star is Exhibit "D1P".   Cashflow is
entitled to receive $1.26 million under a deed (Exhibit "D10)"
which Mr
Campbell QC formally advised the Court (on 22 March 1999) is no longer subject
to a condition precedent.</i>
<P>

<i>	There is no secured creditor of Cashflow who could, or might, be able to
dispute CODFA's equitable claim of priority to Cashflow's
moneys: Exhibit "D1R"
page 4.</i>
<P>

	<i>Unsecured creditors of Cashflow's have no entitlement which can displace
CODFA's equitable entitlements.   Their claims against the
company can rise no
higher than an entitlement to a rateable share of the assets of the company
remaining after discharge of the
company's higher obligations.    They can rise
no higher than the company itself.    They are in effect, through the company,
bound
to rank behind the company's fiduciary obligation to account to
CODFA.'</i>
<P>

407	CODFA then deals with Cashflow's liability to account for it's profits and
benefits obtained from the use of CODFA's moneys.
<P>

<b><i>`CODFA's Submissions as to Cashflow's Liability to Account for its
profits and benefits obtained from use of CODFA's Moneys.</i></b>
<P>

<i>	On the principles outlined . . . above, Cashflow's equitable liability to
account extends to an accounting for profits and benefits
acquired by it from
its use of CODFA's moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	Leaving aside the disputed $20,000.00, Cashflow's concessions of 15 March
1999 include a concession that it obtained benefit from
CODFA's moneys from the
times those moneys were paid out of CODFA's accounts.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Gelder's report of 4 June 1998 (Exhibit "D1G"), at page 7, also confirms
that Cashflow received a benefit from CODFA's moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	Given that Cashflow's equitable obligation is to "restore the estate" of
CODFA, it matters not that Cashflow may have wasted the
profits or benefits
which accrued to it from CODFA's moneys.   On the principles discussed in Hagen
v Waterhouse, and affirmed by
the Court of Appeal in Alemite Lubrequip Pty Ltd
v Adams, the appropriate course is to order Cashflow to repay $180,000.00 with
compound
interest calculated at a mercantile rate. </i>
<P>

<i>An appropriate rate, established by dealings (not in dispute in these
proceedings) between the parties, is  3.5% per month calculated
on daily rests:
Exhibit "PXC" page B50;   Bonvino affidavit sworn 27 April 1998 paragraph
52(b).</i>
<P>

<i>In any event, no less interest should be allowed than interest at the rate
ordinarily allowed pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>, section 94.</i>
<P>

	
<P>

<i>	The foundation of CODFA's entitlements in equity renders it unnecessary to
consider whether, at common law, there is a restitutionary
cause of action for
interest alone.    See Mason and Carter, op cit, paragraphs [2807]-[2808].
Nevertheless, to the extent it may
be necessary for the Court to make a
determination on this topic, CODFA submits that it is entitled to a
restitutionary award of
interest for the reasons stated by Mason and
Carter.'</i>
<P>

408	Further submissions of CODFA go to the disputed $20,000 paid to Trans-pac
on 2 April 1996:
<P>

<b><i>`Cashflow's Liability for the Disputed $20,000.00 Paid to
Transpac</i></b>
<P>

<i>	The only basis upon which Cashflow contends that it should not be liable to
account for the amount of $20,000.00 paid out of CODFA's
bank account on 2
April 1996 is that, it says, it obtained no benefit from the payment because
the moneys were ultimately paid to
Transpac No 2 and, it says, it had no formal
factoring agreement with Transpac No 2.</i>
<P>

<i>	The mechanics of the payment are not in dispute.    The payment was made by
means of a cheque drawn on an account of CODFA ("the
Burkett Account") and made
payable to Transpac No 1.  The cheque was deposited, in fact, in an account of
Transpac No 2.</i>
<P>

<i>	The critical issue is not whether Cashflow ultimately obtained a benefit
from the payment to Transpac (in either of its guises) but
whether the payment
was made on the account of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>	The "theft principle" derived from Black v S Freedman &amp; Co. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2012%20CLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 12
CLR 105</a> at 109-110 extends to property other than cash and is capable of
applying equally to a theft of money by means of an unauthorized
cheque:

J.</i>
<P>

<i>	For the reasons stated, . . .  the knowledge of Mr Walters (who physically
made the payment) must be attributed to Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>.	In assessing whether Cashflow obtained a benefit from the disputed payment
the following facts are relevant:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Although the cheque was banked in Transpac No 2's account, it was drawn
in favour of Transpac No 1.</i>
<P>

<i>	In this, it differs from the misappropriated moneys which CODFA seeks to
recover from Transpac No 2.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	At no stage did CODFA ever have a commercial relationship (of any kind)
with any Transpac company.  It had no commercial relationship
with Transpac No
1 or Transpac No 2.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Cashflow had a commercial relationship with both Transpac No 1 and
Transpac No 2 or, at least, Transpac No 1.</i>
<P>

<i>	Whether or not Cashflow's commercial relationship with Transpac No 1 was
"irregular" insofar as it involved payments and receipts
outside the two
companies' formal factoring agreement, the fact is they had a commercial
relationship.</i>
<P>

<i>	Further, senior counsel for Cashflow has conceded in these proceedings that
Cashflow received moneys from Transpac No 2, and paid
moneys to the same
company, whether or not those receipts and payments were pursuant to a formal
factoring agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	In the records of Cashflow the disputed $20,000.00 was brought to
account as between itself and Transpac No 1: Exhibit "D1Q" (second
entry).</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Mr Walters, who physically effected the theft of CODFA's moneys,
regarded the disputed $20,000.00 as having been paid out of CODFA's
moneys on
account of Cashflow.   It is part of the net sum of $180,000.00 which he
confessed was owed by Cashflow to CODFA as a result
of the unauthorized
inter-company payments.   At the time of his confession, and for a period
thereafter, Mr Walters was and remained
an officer of Cashflow.    See Mr
Kull's statement of 14 April 1998 (Exhibit "D1A") paragraph 51 and the computer
"loan accounts"
which Mr Walters prepared shortly after his confession
(CODFA's Tender Bundle No. 2, at document No. 2, within Exhibit "D1X"). </i>
<P>

<i>(f)	Despite Mr Walters' dishonesty (which he has not disputed, even when
present during the hearing, in these proceedings), there
is no evidence to
suggest that the payment of $20,000.00 out of CODFA's bank accounts on 2 April
1996 was for his personal benefit
or for the benefit of the Transpac companies
to the exclusion of Cashflow.    Mr Walters certainly made imprudent payments
which
culminated in benefits to the Transpac companies but, on the evidence,
he did so on Cashflow's account and not otherwise.</i>
<P>

<i>	If (contrary to CODFA's submissions) it is necessary to consider whether
Cashflow had a "genuine factoring arrangement" with the
Transpac companies,
that question must be answered in the affirmative on the undisputed evidence of
Alan Maudsley (Exhibit "D1L"),
the only expert "Factor" from whom evidence is
available.    </i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	As summarized in his conclusions (on page 20 of Exhibit "D1L") a factoring
arrangement did exist between Cashflow and Transpac No
1; payments made by
Cashflow to Transpac No 1 are properly to be characterized as within the
general terms of payments made in the
course of factoring; and Cashflow both
stood to benefit, and benefited from, such payments.'</i>
<P>

409	CODFA's submissions that the making of a winding up order against Cashflow
is irrelevant to CODFA's claim for restitution generated
considerable further
attention of the parties.  Cashflow and Mr Star commenced by submitting that
the combined effect of Sections
553 and 555-556 Corporations Law is to limit
CODFA's entitlements (in respect of inter-company transfers, including amounts
received
by Mr Star from CODFA pursuant to 5.7B of the Law) to an entitlement
to prove a debt in the winding up of Cashflow, such debt to
rank with (and to
have no priority over) unsecured creditors generally.  CODFA then addressed
responsive submissions.  Cashflow then
replied. 
<P>

410	The respective submissions were as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>CODFA's Submissions as to the Operation of Corporations Law ss 553 and
555-556</i></b>
<P>

<i>`The submissions of Cashflow and Mr Star must be rejected, as will be shown
by an examination of:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	sections 553 and 555-556 of the Law.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the nature of the restitutionary obligations of Cashflow and Mr Star,
and the circumstances in which those obligations came to
attach to them.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the nature of the relief claimed by CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>	[I]	In summary, CODFA contends that it is entitled, on any view of the
case, to "rank above" the general unsecured creditors of Cashflow.
   This is
because:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Cashflow and Mr Star have a continuing liability to account to CODFA for
the moneys stolen from it and (with or without an entitlement
in CODFA to
proprietary relief) an obligation to restore CODFA's estate; and </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	if it is correct to characterize CODFA's entitlement to restitution as a
"debt" (or an equitable entitlement "in the nature of
a debt", that debt is a
"post-liquidation debt" entitled, as such,  to priority under section 556(1)(a)
of the Law.</i>
<P>

<i>	[II]	At the risk of oversimplification, and leaving aside the disputed
$20,000.00 of 2 April 1996, the dispute between Cashflow/Mr
Star and CODFA in
this area is essentially one of priorities:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	On 15 March 1999 Cashflow and Mr Star conceded that Cashflow has
restitutionary obligations to CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	It is common ground (as established by Exhibit "D1R" at  page 4) that
Cashflow has no "secured creditors".</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The contest of priorities is between CODFA (to which "restitutionary
obligations" are admittedly owed and which claims, inter
alia, equitable
relief) and the unsecured creditors of Cashflow generally.</i>
<P>

<i>	[III]	In considering the operation of sections 553 and 555-556 of the Law
the Court should bear in mind that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	CODFA's claims for equitable relief are essentially founded on the
existence in Cashflow and Mr Star of a liability to account
for  CODFA's
moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	That is so whether the relief under consideration relates to orders
for:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the recognition and/or imposition of a constructive trust; or </i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	equitable compensation, with or without security for its
payment.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the equitable relief sought by CODFA (including non-proprietary relief
to effect compensation) is available as a "remedy", not
as "a right" in the
same sense as a common law entitlement is said to be a "right".    It is
discretionary relief vindicating entitlements
dependent, in the absence of
agreement, on the making of a court order.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	whether the restitutionary obligations of Cashflow and Mr Star are
regarded as having equitable or legal foundations, they must
be regarded as
continuing beyond, or arising after, the commencement of Cashflow's winding up.
</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Even if CODFA has an entitlement to restitution at common law, its
entitlement to equitable relief is additional to it: Nocton
v Lord Ashburton
[1914] AC 933 at 956-957.</i>
<P>

<i>	[IV]	In relation to section 553 of the Corporations Law the following
points should be noted:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	section 553(1) is permissive rather than mandatory.    It does not
exhaust circumstances in which a person's entitlements against
a company may be
vindicated.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the sub-section relates (by the words "being debts or claims the
circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the relevant
date") to debts
or claims which arise before the commencement of a winding up.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the sub-section does not govern "post-liquidation debts or claims".
They may be enforced directly against the company in liquidation
or its
liquidator and, to the extent that section 556 applies, they have "first
ranking priority" over "all other unsecured debts
and claims" insofar as they
fall within section 556(1)(a).</i>
<P>

<i>	[V]	In relation to section 555 of the Law, note that it only applies to
"debts and claims proved" in a winding up.     It does not
apply to other debts
or claims.   It, thus, does not operate to limit:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	post-liquidation debts or claims; </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	curial relief granted against a company; or </i>
<P>

<i>(c)	relief granted against, or obligations incurred by, a liquidator who
then seeks (by reference to section 556(1)(a)) to be indemnified
from the
property of the company.</i>
<P>

<i>	[VI]	In relation to section 556 of the Law the following points should be
noted:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	section 556(1) relates to priority of "debts and claims...in the winding
up of a company".</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	it relates to the priority of certain "debts and claims" over "all other
unsecured debts and claims".</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	it does not limit curial relief granted against a company and/or its
liquidator in the course of a winding up.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	in the context in which the section operates, section 556(1)(a) affords
priority to the entitlement of a company liquidator to
be indemnified from the
property of the company of which he or she is liquidator.</i>
<P>

<i>	[VII]	Insofar as CODFA seeks equitable relief, such entitlements as it may
have (whether to proprietary relief or otherwise) are
not, in the absence of
any agreement between Cashflow (and/or Mr Star) and CODFA, limited by sections
553, 555 and 556 of the Law.
   This is because:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	even if (which Young J has suggested in Re Trivan Pty Ltd   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201654" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14
ACLC 1654</a> at 1657 and 1658 is doubtful) an "entitlement" to equitable relief
can be asserted in a proof of debt, in the circumstances of this
case CODFA's
entitlements cannot properly be characterized as having arisen before the
commencement of the winding up.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	CODFA's entitlements cannot be said to have arisen before the
commencement of the winding up because:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	at no time before the commencement of the winding up did Cashflow agree
to account to CODFA or to make restitution in favour of
CODFA for the moneys
stolen from CODFA.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	either CODFA is entitled to a constructive trust (as it has earlier
submitted), or its entitlements to non-proprietary relief
in equity arise on
the making of a Court order (and no Court order was made before the
commencement of the winding up).</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	on the case for which Cashflow and Mr Star have contended,  the
"entitlement" of Cashflow to make an election about whether
or not it would
retain CODFA's stolen moneys and benefits derived from those moneys, did not
arise until after Mr Bonvino became
fully aware of the inter-company transfers
on or about 28 October 1996 (Bonvino Affidavit sworn 27 April 1998 paragraph
52(c)) and
was not exercised (at least expressly) until the opening address of
Mr Campbell QC on 15 March 1999 (transcript pages 30-31).</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	Cashflow and Mr Star (having retained and used CODFA's moneys, having
obtained and elected to retain benefits derived from those
moneys, and having
elected to acknowledge restitutionary obligations) cannot limit the legal
effect of their conduct by retrospectively
characterizing Cashflow's
restitutionary obligations as no more than an obligation to permit CODFA to
prove in Cashflow's winding
up as if its entitlements were limited to an
unsecured, pre-liquidation debt or claim. </i>

<P>

<i>	[I]	A plaintiff who establishes a breach of fiduciary duty has available to
him a range of remedies.    Not only does he have a range
of remedies from
which to choose but those remedies are relatively flexible.   They include the
remedy of constructive trust (including
tracing trust property as may be
appropriate), the remedy of account and the remedy of compensation in equity:
J. J. Doyle QC (as
Doyle C.J. then was) at page 211 of P.D. Finn (ed), Equity
and  Commercial Relationships (1987).</i>
<P>

<i>	[II]	The nature of the case will determine the appropriate remedy available
for selection by a plaintiff: Maguire v Makaronis <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 449</a> at 467,

<P>

<i>	[III]	The fundamental liability of a defaulting fiduciary is to account:
Justice J B Kearney, "Accounting for a Fiduciary's Gains
in Commercial
Contexts" (in Finn, Equity and Commercial Relationships) at 203.</i>
<P>

<i>	[IV]	A constructive trust is merely a means of achieving such an
accounting: Kearney, op cit.    Once it is established that a fiduciary
is
liable to account for a profit or benefit which he has obtained there can be no
objection to his being held to account as a constructive
trustee of that profit
or benefit: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corpn <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR
41</a> at 107-108 per Mason J.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is open to an Equity Court to "retrospectively impose a constructive
trust" by way of "equitable remedy" in circumstances in which
the remedy is
based upon an underlying failure to account by a fiduciary and not merely (as
may be allowed in USA) upon "idiosyncratic
notions of fairness and justice":
Muschinski v Dodds <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20160%20CLR%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 160 CLR 583</a> at 614-616 per Deane J.</i>
<P>

<i>	The fact that a defendant's "profit or gain" cannot readily be identified
is not an impediment; the Court can, by awarding equitable
compensation in lieu
of an inquiry, measure the fiduciary's gain by reference to the loss of the
beneficiary: Kearney J, ibid page
207.</i>
<P>

<i>	[V]	Whether by moulding orders for a constructive trust or otherwise it is
open to the Court, exercising equitable jurisdiction,
to mould relief so as to
secure performance of the fiduciary's obligation to account.    Accordingly, it
is open to the Court (for
example) to grant a lien over an identifiable asset
of the fiduciary, whether or not trust property can be "traced" into that
property
and a constructive trust declared.</i>
<P>

<i>	That is the context of the quotation from Goff and Jones, The Law of
Restitution (4th edition, 1993) page 96 in paragraph 37.2.3.2
on page 33 of
Cashflow's undated "Written Overview Submission".</i>
<P>

<i>	In United Surgical Corpn v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20NSWLR%20766" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982]
NSWLR 766</a> at 816B-F McLelland J accepted that it was open to him, as a matter
of jurisdiction, to secure the performance of a liability to
account by the
imposition of a lien even though it was difficult, if not impossible, to trace
profits into any particular asset of
the defaulting fiduciary concerned.    His
decision not to impose a lien was based upon discretionary, not jurisdictional
grounds.</i>
<P>

<i>	[VI]	It was by reference to McLelland J's observations in that passage that
Gummow J wrote (in an article entitled "Compensation
for Breach of Fiduciary
Duty" published in T G Youdan ed, Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts (1989) at page
64) that, "stated in terms
of liability to account for loss, the obligation is
to submit to the taking of accounts and to make compensation for loss
occasioned
by breach of duty.</i>
<P>

<i>	[VII]	This passage emphasises the common origins of equitable
"entitlements" to proprietary relief and compensation on enforcement
of a
defaulting fiduciary's liability to account.   It also emphasises the fact that
vindication of equitable "entitlements" may
(as in these proceedings) require
an order of the Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	[VIII]	The interrelationship between the various remedies available in
Equity is also illustrated by the observation of Professor
J D Heydon (as he
then was) in an article entitled "Recent Developments in Constructive Trusts"
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2051%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 51 ALJ 635</a> where (at 644) he wrote: "If in a constructive trustee's
hands there is wrongly acquired property, or property representing it, he
can
be compelled to disgorge it or a tracing claim may lie.    If there is now no
property in the constructive trustee's hands or
if there never was, a personal
action for account lies against him.    In such a case, the dogma that a man
cannot be trustee without
trust property is infringed, and the `constructive
trust' looks much more like a remedy than a substantive institution".   </i>
<P>

<i>That passage was approved by Kearney J, ibid at pages 207-208.</i>

remedies available in equity (at 467-468) but also the following points:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Equity intervenes not so much to recoup a loss suffered by a plaintiff
as to hold a fiduciary to, and vindicate, the high duty
owed by a fiduciary to
the plaintiff: 465, 468, 470.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the obligation of a defaulting fiduciary is essentially one of effecting
restitution to the plaintiff's estate: 469.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	until restitution is made, the Court presumes that a default continues:
470.</i>
<P>

<i>	[X]	In Black v S Freedman &amp; Co <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2012%20CLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 12 CLR 105</a> the High Court
authoritatively determined the "high duty" of a person who receives and retains
stolen property.    Cashflow and Mr
Star are persons upon whom the High Court,
as a matter of policy, has imposed a fiduciary obligation to account.</i>
<P>

<i>	[XI]	In Mr Star's case that obligation is reinforced by his duty as an
officer of the Court to act conscionably:  Re Condon Ex Parte
James  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%206%20LRCh%20App%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 6 Ch

<P>

<i>	[XII]	The observations of Griffith CJ in Black's case (at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20CLR%201099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 CLR 109.9)</a>,
and in Creak's case (at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=15%20CLR%20432%2d433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">15 CLR 432-433)</a> are consistent with the proposition
that a person who innocently receives stolen property may have a limited time
within which he
or she can decide how to account for the property.    The
existence of such an opportunity does not assist Cashflow or Mr Star in
this
case.</i>
<P>

<i>	[XIII]	In these proceedings it is common ground that Cashflow received
property, and derived benefits from property, of CODFA in
circumstances in
which (to put it neutrally) CODFA did not authorize any disposition of the
property to or on the account of Cashflow.</i>
<P>

<i>	Immediately upon the disposition of CODFA's property for the benefit of
Cashflow Cashflow came under a fiduciary obligation to account,
which
obligation continued and was reinforced by deliberate decisions made by or on
behalf of Cashflow (between 28 October 1996 and
15 March 1999, if not earlier)
to retain the benefit of CODFA's property.   In those circumstances, having
retained and accepted
the benefit  Cashflow must bear the burden of disgorging
the property.    Its fiduciary obligation to account cannot properly be
said to
have been displaced by dissipation of CODFA's property (particularly as it has
received benefits and recovered moneys referrable
to the dissipation of
property funded by use of CODFA's property) or by the commencement of its
winding up.</i>
<P>

<i>	[XIV]	Cashflow and Mr Star cannot render their obligation to account to
CODFA nugatory by their contention that they were entitled
to investigate the
facts and thereafter to "elect" how they would account to CODFA.    Until 15
March 1999 they denied the existence
of any restitutionary obligation in favour
of CODFA.   Any "election" they were entitled to make, and did make, would not
displace
their continuing fiduciary obligation to account to CODFA.   On the
contrary, any performance of that obligation by Mr Star or enforcement
of it
against him as liquidator of Cashflow would result in either:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a payment of moneys to CODFA by Cashflow, unaffected by the order of
priorities for which section 556 of the Law provides; or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a payment of moneys to CODFA by Mr Star (as liquidator) and
indemnification of him, from property of Cashflow, as a first-ranking
creditor
under section 556(1)(a).'</i>
<P>

411	Cashflow's responsive submissions were as follows:
<P>

<i>`<b>When did the obligation to make restitution arise</b>.  <b>/ Is the
obligation to make restitution a post-liquidation obligation</b></i>
<P>

<i>1.	CODFA submits that Cashflow's alleged liability to account is a
post-liquidation liability, and so entitled to priority under section
556 (1)
(a) Corporations Law.<b>  </b> That submission should be rejected. </i>
<P>

<i>2.	Section 556 (1) (a) says</i>
<P>

<i>556	(1)	[Ranking]  Subject to this Division, in the winding up of a company
the following debts and claims must be paid in priority
to all other unsecured
debts and claims:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	first, expenses (except deferred expenses) properly incurred by a
relevant authority in preserving, realizing or getting in property
of the
company, or in carrying on the company's business;</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Any obligation of Cashflow to make restitution in relation to the WUPs
does not fit inside that language.  </i>
<P>

<i>		3.1.	 It is not an "expense incurred".  </i>
<P>

<i>		3.2.	The only possible "relevant authority" is the liquidator.  He has not
incurred the restitutionary obligation to repay the WUPs.
 </i>
<P>

<i>		3.3.	Further, the restitutionary obligation to repay the WUPs has not been
incurred "in preserving, realizing or getting in property
of the company, or in
carrying on the company's business".  </i>
<P>

<i>4.	The obligation to make restitution of money paid does not arise from the
fact that Cashflow admitted it, in the course of the present
litigation.   Nor
was it necessary for Cashflow to have knowledge of the circumstances of the
payments before it is under a restitutionary
obligation.    </i>
<P>

<i> 	4.1.	If Cashflow had changed its position on the faith of the payment, the
fact that it did not have  knowledge of the circumstances
which gave rise to
the obligation of restitution would be relevant to whether it could make out
that defence of change of position.
  It is, however, irrelevant to the
existence of CODFA's right (subject to any defence) to have restitution.
</i>
<P>

<i>	4.2.	(It may be that knowledge of the defendant has a different role to
play when restitution is sought in relation to the value
of services conferred,
for there "acceptance" of the benefit of the services has a role to play in
whether a restitutionary obligation
arises.  Acceptance of the benefit requires
knowledge that the benefit has been conferred, not just the fact that the
benefit has
been conferred.   The need for there to be acceptance of the
benefit, in  the case of a restitutionary action for the value of services
conferred, arises from the fact that services conferred cannot be given back in
the same way that money paid can be given back.)</i>
<P>

<i>5.	The right of CODFA to have restitution of those payments which passed
through the bank account of Cashflow arose immediately any
payment of CODFA's
money was made to Cashflow.   </i>
<P>

<i> 	5.1.	In David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Mason
CJ, Deane, Toohey Gaudron and McHugh JJ said</i>
<P>

<i>If we accept the principle that payments made under a mistake of law should
be prima facie recoverable, in the same way as payments
made under a mistake of
fact, a defence of change of position is necessary to ensure that enrichment of
the recipient of the payment
is prevented only in circumstances where it would
be unjust. This does not mean that the concept of unjust enrichment needs to
shift
the primary focus of its attention from the moment of enrichment. From
the point of view of the person making the payment, what happens
after he or
she has mistakenly paid over the money is irrelevant, for it is at that moment
that the defendant is unjustly enriched.
However, the defence of change of
position is relevant to the enrichment of the defendant precisely because its
central element is
that the defendant has acted to his or her detriment on the
faith of the receipt. </i>
<P>

<i>Brennan J said</i>
<P>

<i>If, under a mistake, money is paid to and unjustly enriches a payee, the
payer's right to recover the amount paid accrues at the moment
when the payee
received the money.</i>
<P>

<i>		5.2.	See also Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) v Royal Insurance
Australia Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20182%20CLR%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 182 CLR 51</a>, at 67 per Mason CJ. (Brennan J, with whom
Toohey and McHugh JJ agreed, found no need to consider whether there was a
restitutionary
obligation to repay.)</i>
<P>

<i>6.	In relation to those of the WUPs where there was payment direct from
CODFA to a solvent client of Cashflow, the obligation to make
restitution arose
either when the payment was made by CODFA, or alternatively at the latest when
Cashflow received a benefit arising
from that payment.  </i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>		6.1.	Each of the payments to a solvent client generated a benefit, in the
form of fee income, immediately the payment was made to
the solvent client.
</i>
<P>

<i> 	6.2.	Further, immediately the payment was made to the solvent client,
Cashflow would receive the benefit of: </i>
<P>

<i>		6.2.1.	covenants from that solvent client that the debts sold were valid
and enforceable </i>
<P>

<i>		6.2.2.	the right to place 20% of the face value of the debts purchased
into a retention fund, </i>
<P>

<i>		6.2.3.	covenants to pay any further fees which might accrue in relation to
the debts purchased by that payment, and </i>
<P>

<i>		6.2.4.	covenants that the solvent client would refund any balance of the
debt which was outstanding after 90 days, together with
</i>
<P>

<i>		6.2.5.	all the other rights which arise under the factoring deed in
relation to any factored debt.    </i>
<P>

<i>Thus the obligation to make restitution, in relation to the WUPs made to
solvent clients, arose well before liquidation.  </i>
<P>

<i>7.	Benefits of that kind (or any other kind) were not received by Cashflow
in relation to the payment of $20,000 made direct from
CODFA to Trans-pac on 2
April 1996.  The reasons for this are because </i>
<P>

<i> 	7.1.	that payment was received by Trans-pac No 2 (and so was not to a
client of Cashflow at all), </i>
<P>

<i>		7.2.	no fees were in fact received from Trans-pac No 1 or Trans-pac No 2
in relation to that payment, </i>
<P>

<i>		7.3.	there was no factoring of debts occurring in relation to that
payment, and </i>
<P>

<i>		7.4.	no factoring deed existed with Trans-pac No 2 under which any
contractual benefits could arise</i>
<P>

<b><i>Is the obligation to make restitution one which arises because Cashflow
has a fiduciary obligation to account</i></b>
<P>

<i>8.	The obligation to make restitution is a common law obligation, which
arises from the fact of receipt of the payment itself, or
of benefits
attributable to the payment.   The authoritative explanation of the
restitutionary obligation, which has been given in
David Securities, makes no
mention of the possibility of there being an equitable basis for the
obligation.  </i>
<P>

<i>9.	Chase Manhattan does not provide an acceptable basis for saying that
there was a fiduciary obligation imposed on Cashflow by reason
of the receipt
of the WUPs.   It should not be regarded as stating the current law in
Australia.  There have been some scattered
references to Chase Manhattan in
cases over the years, but nothing which obliges this court to accept that it
imposes a fiduciary
obligation on Cashflow.  </i>
<P>

<i>		9.1.	In Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Limited Brennan J made reference
to Chase Manhattan Bank v Israel-British Bank, as follows</i>
<P>

<i>There is no analogy between the present case and one in which a constructive
trust is imposed on money or other property     which
is acquired by a
fiduciary in breach of his duty but not pursuant to a voidable contract. In
such a case there is no question of
avoiding the contract before the
constructive trust is imposed. A fortiori, there is no analogy between the
present case and one
where a constructive trust is imposed on money or other
property which is acquired by a non-fiduciary otherwise than by contract:
as,
e.g., in Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. v. Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd.[1981] 1
Ch 105, at pp 118-120.. </i>
<P>

<i>In other words, Brennan J regards Chase Manhattan as a case of a remedial
constructive trust imposed on a person who is  not a fiduciary.
 None of the
other judges of the High Court in Daly made reference to Chase Manhattan,
notwithstanding that counsel for the appellant
had submitted</i>
<P>

<i>Alternatively, the money was entrusted to the firm because it was held on a
constructive trust for Dr. Daly. The legal title passed
by reason of a
transaction procured by the transferee in     breach of fiduciary duty. Dr.
Daly obtained an equitable interest in

<i>That observation did no more than recognize that equitable rights "may"
arise.  The observation was obiter in the judgment of Wilson

was quite unrelated to the matter for decision by the court (which concerned a
conviction for a crime involving
taking bank notes).  The other three judges
who delivered judgments in the case (Gibbs CJ, Brennan and Deane JJ) said
nothing on
this topic.  </i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.	In Hartogen Energy Ltd v AGL Co Gummow J, in the course of deciding
whether a liquidator should be permitted to maintain a
claim to legal
professional privilege for documents, gave consideration to the rule in Ex
parte James.  </i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.1.	That case was one which related to a situation where a trustee in
bankruptcy had demanded that an execution creditor, who
had received some of
the property of the bankrupt, should pay to the trustee the amount that he had
received.  The execution creditor
paid the money, then brought an action to
have it returned to him.  The trustee in bankruptcy resisted that claim on the
ground that
the execution creditor had paid the money under a mistake of law.
James LJ held that the trustee was obliged to give the money back.
 In the
course of his reasons James LJ said that the money that the trustee held
belonged in equity to someone else.  Gummow J said,
at 573</i>
<P>

<i>The crucial passage in the judgment of James LJ (at 614) is as follows:
</i>
<P>

<i>"With regard to the other point, that the money was voluntarily paid to the
trustee under a mistake of law, and not of fact, I think
that the principle
that money paid under a mistake of law cannot be recovered must not be pressed
too far, and there are several
cases in which the Court of Chancery has held
itself not bound strictly by it. I am of opinion that a trustee in bankruptcy
is an
officer of the court. He has inquisitorial powers given him by the court
and the court regards him as his officer, and he is to hold
money in his hands
upon trust for its equitable distribution among the creditors. The court, then,
finding that he has in his hands,
money which in equity belongs to someone
else, ought to set an example to the world by paying it to the person really
entitled to
it. In my opinion, the Court of Bankruptcy ought to be as honest as
other people." </i>
<P>

<i>Two years later the same judge said, in Rogers v Ingham  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%203%20Ch%20D%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 3 Ch D 351</a> at
355: </i>
<P>

<i>"I have no doubt that there are some cases which have been relied on, in
which this Court has not adhered strictly to the rule that
a mistake of law is
not always incapable of being remedied in this Court; but relief has never been
given in the case of a simple
money demand by one person against another, there
being as between those two persons no fiduciary relation whatever, and no
equity
to supervene by reason of the conduct of either of the parties." </i>
<P>

<i>The passage which I have set out from Ex parte James has to be read with
this in mind. The passage is concerned with explaining what
in the
circumstances of that case led the court to find that there was an equity in
the party claiming repayment. Further, the proposition
that the money in equity
belonged to the claimant for repayment is consistent with modern authority,
exemplified by Chase Manhattan
Bank NA v Israel-British Bank London  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20Ch%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] Ch
105.</a></i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.2.	In the circumstances of Ex parte James it was quite clear that the
trustee in bankruptcy held the property which had been
paid to him by the
execution creditor as a fiduciary - it was clearly not his own, simply because
the only reason why it had been
paid to him was because he was the trustee in
bankruptcy.   In that situation, the only choice concerned whether it was held
on the
trusts on which the property of the bankrupt estate was held, or whether
it was held for the execution creditor.  </i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.3.	There is nothing in Ex parte James  to suggest that any
unauthorised payment which CODFA makes to Cashflow, or to a solvent
client of
Cashflow, will result in the money being held in any sort of similar fiduciary
fashion.   </i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.4.	The final sentence of the extract quoted from the judgment of
Gummow J is obiter, and hardly an endorsement of the decision
in Chase
Manhattan.  </i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.5.	The derisory remarks about Chase Manhattan that are contained in
Meagher Gummow and Lehane Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies,
3rd edition,
paragraphs 505,1402 and in Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia, 6th edition,
paragraphs 2703,2705 show that Gummow J
does not accept that it is correct if
it holds that a fiduciary obligation arises when there is a mistaken payment.
</i>
<P>

<i>		9.4.6.	We also mention here that, contrary to the submissions which CODFA
makes in &#167;23 of its latest submissions, the decision
in Ex parte James, as
explained by Gummow J in Hartogen, has no bearing on whether Mr Star ought to
recognise any sort of equitable
obligation in relation to the assets of
Cashflow.  A fundamental distinction between the present case and ex parte
James is that
all the assets in Mr Star's' hands are ones which  the company
owned at the time of its liquidation, or  (like the right to receive
money from
Westpac for settlement of the litigation against it) are the fruits of a right
of action which the company had at the
time it went into liquidation.  </i>
<P>

<i>		9.5.	In Commonwealth of Australia v ANZ Banking Group (O'Keefe CJ Comm Div
7 October 1993 unreported, accessible in Butterworths
unreported judgments no
BC9302376 at 7 ) his Honour said </i>
<P>

<i>Monies paid as a result of fraud or mistake are impressed with a trust in
favour of the payer, who is entitled to an order for the
return of those
monies; (Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel British Bank (London) Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20Ch%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 Ch
105</a> at 117 to 120, 128.)</i>
<P>

<i>Where money has been stolen, that money is held in trust by the thief. Once
such money has been impressed with that trust, he, the
thief, cannot remove
from it its character as trust money. If he pays it over to another person,
then it may be followed into that
persons hands. (Black v S Freedman and Co
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2012%20CLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 12 CLR 105</a> at 117.)</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Eliades therefore in my view holds the various monies referred to above
as trustee for the ANZ.</i>
<P>

<i>Those remarks were made in the context of a tracing claim, brought by the
true owner of money against a true thief.  They do not assist
the present case.
In so far as his Honour drew any principle from Chase Manhattan at all, it was
relating to moneys paid as a result
of "fraud or mistake".  </i>
<P>

<i>		9.6.	In Chippendale v Commissioner of Taxation, Lehane J said that the
obligation to repay money paid under mistake was treated
as a common law
obligation, not an equitable one.  His use of a "cf" when referring to Chase
Manhattan suggests that he is contrasting
his own view with that expressed in
Chase Manhattan.  </i>
<P>

<i>Equally, relief would be available in accordance with common law principles
in a case where money was paid as tax under a mistake
of fact: for example, if
a taxpayer applied the right principles in calculating tax due but made an
error in the calculation or,
overlooking the fact that the tax due had already
been paid, mistakenly paid it again (cf Chase Manhattan Bank NA v
Israel-British
Bank (London) Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20Ch%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 Ch 105).</a></i>
<P>

<i>		9.7.	In Attorney-General (UK) v Heinemann Publishers Australia Pty Ltd
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2075%20ALR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 75 ALR 353</a> at 455 McHugh JA made mention of Chase Manhattan, but for the
conflicts of law principle decided by it, not the point which is relevant
to
this case.  </i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>		9.8.	It follows that there is no authority which prevents the Court from
following the English cases set out in  Cashflow's submissions
on constructive
trust, in denying that there is any fiduciary obligation here.  </i>

<P>

<i>82.   Debts provable in bankruptcy</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	Subject to this Division, all debts and liabilities, present or future,
certain or contingent, to which a bankrupt was subject
at the date of the

discharge by reason of an obligation incurred
before the date of the bankruptcy
, are provable in his or her bankruptcy .</i>
<P>

<i>(1A)	Without limiting subsection (1), debts referred to in that subsection
include a debt consisting of all or part of a sum that
became payable by the
bankrupt under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order before the date of

<P>

<i>(2)	Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by
reason of a contract, promise or breach of trust are not

<P>

<i>(3)	Subject to subsection (3A), penalties or fines imposed by a court in
respect of an offense against a law, whether a law of the
Commonwealth or not,
are not provable in bankruptcy .</i>
<P>

<i>(3AA)	An amount payable under an order made under paragraph 1317EA (3) (b)
of the Corporations Law of a State or Territory is not
provable in bankruptcy
.</i>
<P>

<i>(3A)	An amount payable under a pecuniary penalty order or an interstate
pecuniary penalty order is provable in bankruptcy .</i>
<P>

<i>(3B)	A debt is not provable in a bankruptcy in so far as the debt consists
of interest accruing, in respect of a period commencing
on or after the date of
the bankruptcy , on a debt that is provable in the bankruptcy .</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	The trustee shall make an estimate of the value of a debt or liability
provable in the bankruptcy which, by reason of its being
subject to a
contingency, or for any other reason, does not bear a certain value.</i>
<P>

<i>(8)	In this section, "liability" includes:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	compensation for work or labour done;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	an obligation or possible obligation to pay money or money's worth on
the breach of an express or implied covenant, contract,
agreement or
undertaking, whether or not the breach occurs, is likely to occur or is capable
of occurring, before the discharge of
the bankrupt ; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	an express or implied engagement, agreement or undertaking, to pay, or
capable of resulting in the payment of, money or money's
worth, whether the
payment is:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	in respect of amount - fixed or unliquidated;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	in respect of time - present or future, or certain or dependent on a
contingency; or</i>
<P>

<i>(iii) in respect of the manner of valuation - capable of being ascertained
by fixed rules or only as matter of opinion.</i>
<P>

<i>11.	A claim for restitution of money paid to or to the use of a person who
has become bankrupt is a claim which is provable in a bankruptcy,
because it is
a liquidated demand.  CODFA's claim to an account is in reality a claim to get
back the money it parted with, with
interest.  That is a liquidated claim.
</i>
<P>

<i>12.	The bankruptcy provisions setting out what were provable debts were
deliberately cast in wide terms, excluding nothing but claims
for personal
torts, so as to provide the bankrupt with the fullest opportunity to make a
fresh start after the bankruptcy, freed
from nearly all claims and
demands.</i>
<P>

<i>13.	While there was not the same policy objective (of allowing a natural
person a fresh start) in drafting the winding up provisions
relating to
provable debts, the provisions of the bankruptcy legislation about provable
debts were taken across into legislation
governing the winding up of insolvent
companies.</i>
<P>

<i>14.	In the time before the enactment of section 553 and 554A Corporations
Law, it was held that  where a company has received money
which is money out of
which A has been cheated, and the company has subsequently gone into
liquidation, A has a right of proof in
the liquidation for the amount in
relation to which A has been cheated, and in relation to which A has a claim in
restitution against
the company. However, no claim for interest was allowed to
be proved in the winding up.  Cutten &amp; Harvey v Mount  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2050%20SASR%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 50 SASR 81</a> at
87-88.  That authority remains applicable today. </i>
<P>

<i>15.	When s 553 and 554A Corporations Law were introduced, it was with the
intention of allowing even claims for unliquidated damages
to be provable in
the winding up of insolvent companies.  Butterworths Corporations Law -
Principles and Practice, para 5.6.0225
says</i>
<P>

<i>Generally</i>
<P>

<i>Unliquidated claims are provable in the winding up of a company. However, in
the case of insolvent companies, this is subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 82(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy
Act 1966</a> (see s 553E). That section provides that demands in the nature of
unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract,
promise or
breach of trust are not provable in bankruptcy. The limitation on the ability
to prove, contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 82(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>, should be construed
narrowly. The expression "by reason of" in that section indicates that it is
not necessary to establish more
than an appropriate nexus between the damages
claimed and the contract or promise.</i>
<P>

<i>Tort</i>
<P>

<i>Until the passing of the CLRA it was settled law that unliquidated damages
for tort could not be proved in a winding up of an insolvent
company. ..... .
However, it is recognized that a strict application of the bankruptcy rule to
corporate insolvency may lead to "extraordinary
consequences": see the comments

<P>

<i>This rule does not apply where there are surplus assets. There is nothing in
the law of bankruptcy or in the law of companies which
prevents an unsatisfied
claimant, in respect of a claim in tort which was still unliquidated by
judgment at the commencement of a
winding up, from obtaining satisfaction out
of the surplus assets which remain after debts and costs of winding up have
been paid,
before anything is paid to the shareholders. 30.  Nor does it
prevent the proof of claims which were already liquidated at the time
of the
making of a winding up order (being the relevant date): Re Autolook Pty Ltd

<P>

<i>.....</i>
<P>

<i>The Explanatory Memorandum to the CLRA states that the effect of ss 553 and
554A will overcome the effect of s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy
Act 1966"and thereby
permit claims in tort which are unliquidated at the time of the winding up to
be admissible in the winding up":
para 853.</i>
<P>

<i>16.	Thus, under the present Corporations Law, with section 553 and 554A
allowing the proof of unliquidated claims, there is no doubt
that the
obligation of Cashflow to make restitution to CODFA in relation to the WUPs
gives rise to a claim which is provable in the
winding up of Cashflow.  </i>
<P>

<i>17.	The basis on which a court decides whether it will permit an action
against a company in liquidation is that it is more convenient
to allow the
matter to be dealt with by an action than by lodgment of a proof of debt.  That
the court has decided that it is more
convenient to allow the present action to
proceed, rather than insisting on CODFA lodging a proof of debt and then
dealing with an
appeal against the rejection of that proof of debt, ought not
result in CODFA being in any better position than it would have been
in if the
proof of debt route had been followed.  </i>
<P>

<b><i>Is a personal obligation of a fiduciary to make good a loss, one which is
provable in the winding up of the fiduciary</i></b>
<P>

<i>18.	We dispute, for reasons given in the course of the hearing, that
Cashflow owes, or ever owed, fiduciary obligations in relation
to the WUPs.
However, if we are wrong about that, all that any fiduciary obligation to
account results in, is a personal obligation
on the fiduciary to pay money.  If
the fiduciary becomes insolvent, that personal obligation results in a proof of
debt.  </i>
<P>

<i>19.	There is old and uncontradicted authority that the amount for which a
natural person fiduciary can be required to account is provable
in the
bankruptcy of the fiduciary.  (If the claim against the fiduciary was in the
nature of a claim for unliquidated damages, it
might not have been provable in
the bankruptcy.)  </i>
<P>

<i>20.	Section 82 (2) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> makes clear that a personal liability of a
trustee to make restitution for breach of trust is provable in the bankruptcy.
 If that
species of fiduciary obligation is provable in the bankruptcy, it is
consistent that an action for other types of breach of fiduciary
duty ought
also be provable in the bankruptcy.  </i>
<P>

<i>21.	It is the effect of section 553 and 554A Corporations Law that any
doubts that there might be about whether all and every claim
for breach of
fiduciary duty are provable in the winding up of a corporation (including
claims which are in the nature of unliquidated
claims) has been removed.
</i>
<P>

<i>22.	A dictum of Young J in Re Trivan is to the effect that an entitlement to
the equitable relief of subrogation cannot be asserted
in a proof of debt,
because subrogation is an equitable remedy, not a right.  (The ratio of the
decision was that subrogation was
not available, because the person seeking it
had failed to do equity.)  Nothing in Re Trivan casts doubt on the ability to
lodge
a proof of debt for the loss sustained by reason of breach by a company
in liquidation of a fiduciary obligation.  </i>
<P>

<b><i>Alleged "financial support" by Bonvino of Cashflow</i></b>
<P>

<i>23.	That it would have been possible, in December 1994, for Pyrafount to
inject a further $500,000 does not bear upon the solvency
of Cashflow in the 12
months from 12 September 1995.  </i>
<P>

<i>24.	As to the alleged "inference" that Bonvino and his company had agreed
not to withdraw their funds without arranging alternative
financing </i>
<P>

<i>24.1.	that is contrary to the express evidence of Bonvino in his affidavit
of 14 March, "I will be able to withdraw the funds in three
months even if you
cannot find a replacement" </i>
<P>

<i> 24.2.	it was never put to Bonvino in cross-examination that there was any
such agreement.  </i>
<P>

<i>	27.	The affidavit of 14 March 1999 makes clear that Bonvino had, at the
outset, the right to withdraw the funds at any time.  His
holding 51% of the
shares, and therefore having the practical ability to change the board of
directors, meant that he had the capacity
to ensure that Cashflow agreed to
whatever terms for withdrawal of funds he wished to have.  Bonvino had this
practical ability to
get his funds out, and vary any agreement under which they
had been provided,  whenever he wanted, regardless of the terms that had
been
originally agreed for their withdrawal.</i>

	<b>Dealing with CODFA's Constructive Trust Case</b>
<P>

<b>	General Principles</b>
<P>

413	As recently as March 1999, the High Court of Australia has had occasion to
caution that care is required in the use of the term
`constructive' in this
context.  In <i>Giumelli v Giumelli</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 10</a>, (24 March 1999), Gleeson
CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ at paragraph 2, cited the following
statement from Scott on Trusts 4th
edition (1989) volume 5 paragraph 462.4:
<P>

	<i>`It is sometimes said that when there are sufficient grounds for imposing a
constructive trust, the Court `constructs a trust'.  The
expression is, of
course, absurd.  The word `constructive' is derived from the verb `construe',
not from the verb `construct'. .
. .   The Court construes the circumstances in
the sense that it explains or interprets them;  it does not construct
them.'</i>
<P>

414	In <i>Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281919%29%20225%20NY%20380" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1919) 225 N.Y. 380</a>, Cardozo J
explained the principle which informs the raising of a constructive trust as
follows:
<P>

	<i>`A constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity
finds expression.  When property has been acquired in
such circumstances that
the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial
interest, equity converts
him into a trustee.'</i>
<P>

415	At page 389 Cardozo J said:
<P>

	<i>`A court of equity in decreeing a constructive trust is bound by no
unyielding formula.  The equity of the transaction must shape
the measure of
relief.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[Applied by Mason J, as he then was, in <i>Hospital Products Ltd v
United States Surgical Corporation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a> at 108].
<P>

416	The inquiry is as to whether, according to the principles of equity, it
would be a fraud for the defendant to deny the trust.
 Hence, the inquiry is
not as to the actual or presumed intention of the parties.  Cf<i> Jacobs' Law
of Trusts in Australia</i>, 6th edition, Butterworths, 1997 edited by R.P.
Meagher and W.M.C. Gummow at paragraph 1301.
<P>

417	Deane J stated in <i>Muschinski v Dodds</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20160%20CLR%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 160 CLR 583</a> at 614:
<P>

	<i>`Viewed in its modern context, the constructive trust can properly be
described as a remedial institution which equity imposes regardless
of actual
or presumed agreement or intention (and subsequently protects) to preclude the
retention or assertion of beneficial ownership
of property to the extent that
such retention or assertion would be contrary to equitable principle.'</i>
<P>

418	Hence, one may proceed upon the basis that CODFA must show that some legal
or equitable principle operating in its favour, justifies
treating as
unconscionable, the retention by Cashflow of the moneys 
<P>

	(a)	now held by Cashflow in respect of which CODFA claims a declaration that a
constructive trust exists or
<P>

(b)	which may be ordered to be repaid by CODFA to Cashflow as a consequence of
the application of the insolvency provisions of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

	It is insufficient to appeal to general notions of fairness or reasonableness.
[Cf Ford and Lee, Principles of the Law of Trusts,
3rd edition 1996, LBC
Information Services, paragraph 22020.]
<P>

419	Clearly the list of constructive trusts is not closed.  <i>English v Dedham
Vale Properties</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20All%20ER%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 All ER 382</a> at 398 per Slade J.
<P>

420	This case throws up the importance of taking into account commercial
considerations.  In <i>Woodson (Sales) Pty Ltd v Woodson (Australia) Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%207%20BPR%2014%2c685" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 7 BPR 14,685</a> at 14,709 Santow J said:
<P>

	<i>`Remedies of equity, flexibly applied in a modern commercial context, must
be adapted to commercial realities.  Thus, for example,
relief which is
appropriate to dealing with breaches of traditional family settlements may
require adjustment in a commercial context,
if it is not to be unduly heavy
handed.  That does not mean there are automatically lesser standards in a
commercial setting, necessarily
rendering equitable relief inappropriate.
Rather it recognises there may be wholly different circumstances and
expectations.  Such
an adaptation of equitable relief removes much of the
objection to equity's intrusion into commercial dealings, so long too as that
intrusion remains principled rather than unpredictable.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The Case Fails at Threshold</b>
<P>

421	CODFA's constructive trust case fails at threshold for at least the
following reason:
<P>

	In order for a constructive trust to be imposed in the circumstances of this
case, there would have to be:
<P>

<i>	</i>(a)	as to the moneys the subject of Cashflow's claim described in
paragraph 418(a), identifiable trust property now held by Cashflow
to which
such trust would attach.  No such identifiable trust property exists;
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	as to moneys which become subject to the order referred to in
Cashflow's claim described in paragraph 418(b), a legal or equitable
principle
which justifies treating as unconscionable, the liquidator's retention of such
moneys for the purpose of their being made
available to creditors pursuant to
the winding up.  No such principle justifies that treatment in the
circumstances proven in this
case.
<P>

422	Before turning to this question, it is convenient to examine another
threshold consideration.  Whilst not in itself determinative
of CODFA's case,
it is clearly an important issue.  I refer here to the attribution to Cashflow
of notice or knowledge of Mr Walters'
misappropriations from CODFA of the paid
funds.  The two routes to the attribution of knowledge to a corporation are
through agency
and through the directing mind and will of the corporation.  I
turn to deal with each.
<P>

	<b>The Imputing of Notice or Knowledge</b>
<P>

<b>	Knowledge through Mr Walters' acting as agent for Cashflow</b>
<P>

423	In <i>Re Hampshire Land Company</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%20743" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch 743</a>, approved by the House
of Lords in <i>JC Houghton &amp; Company v Nothard, Lowe &amp; Wills Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1928%5d%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1928] AC 1</a>, the facts involved the <i>Hampshire Land Company </i>which was
closely connected to a building society.  Both the company and the society had
their offices in the same building, four
directors of the company were also
directors of the society and both corporations had a certain Mr Wills as
secretary.  In 1892,
the society went into liquidation and in 1893, the company
passed an extraordinary resolution in favour of voluntary winding up.
 The
proceedings concerned a claim by the liquidators of the society to prove in the
winding up of the company for a debt of over
&#163;30,000 for money lent by the
society to the company.  The facts of the case turned on the borrowing power of
the company, which
was not to exceed the paid up capital (that being
&#163;10,000), unless authorised by general meeting.  Vaughan Williams J found
as a matter of fact that in 1881 a general meeting was held and a resolution
was passed authorising the directors of the company
to borrow the moneys from
the society.  His Lordship also found that that meeting was irregularly
convened, not being in accordance
with the company articles.  It was argued by
the company that the resolution was not binding on the company as the society
was said
to have taken with notice of the irregularity, Mr Wills as common
officer of both the society and the company, being aware that the
borrowing was
ultra vires the company directors.
<P>

424	In considering the general proposition that the knowledge of a common
officer is always the knowledge of the two companies,
Vaughan Williams J
rejected that proposition stating at page 748 that:
<P>

	<i>`Knowledge which has been acquired by the officer of one company will not
be imputed to the other company, unless the common officer
had some duty
imposed on him to communicate that knowledge to the other company, and had some
duty imposed on him by the company
which is alleged to be affected by the
notice, to receive the notice.'  </i>[Cf <i>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20131%20CLR%20634" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 131 CLR 634</a> at page 658 per Mason J]
<P>

425	Relevantly to the facts there under consideration, Vaughan Williams J, in
admitting the proof of debt, continued at page 749
as follows:
<P>

	<i>`[I]f Wills had been guilty of a fraud, the personal knowledge of Wills of
the fraud that he had committed upon the company would
not have been knowledge
of the society of the facts constituting that fraud;  because common sense at
once leads one to the conclusion
that it would be impossible to infer that the
duty either of giving or receiving notice, will be fulfilled where the common
agent
is himself guilty of fraud.  It seems to me that if you assume here at Mr
Wills was guilty of irregularity - a breach of duty in
respect of these
transactions - the same inference is to be drawn as if he had been guilty of
fraud.'</i>
<P>

426	The principles in accordance with which a corporation may be attributed
with the knowledge of a person who is an officer of
that corporation are
analogous to the principles determining whether a principal may be attributed
with the knowledge of his or her
agent.
<P>

427	A fundamental principle of agency is that in certain circumstances, the
principal must be attributed with the agent's knowledge.
 In <i>Bowstead and
Reynolds on Agency</i> 16th Edition 1996 at 8-206, two lines of reasoning are
stated to justify this principle.  The first, outlined by Palles CB in
<i>Taylor v Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1913%5d%202%20Ir%20R1" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1913] 2 Ir R1</a> at 21, goes to the
identity of the principal and agent:
<P>

	<i>`. . . every act of the agent, within the scope of his authority, is the
act of the principal.  Consequently all knowledge acquired
by the agent when
acting within the scope of his authority is the knowledge of the
principal.'</i>
<P>

428	The second line of reasoning is based on the presumption that where an
agent has notice or knowledge of a matter relevant to
the principal, that
notice or knowledge will be passed on to the principal.  That presumption is
rebuttable -<i> A/S Rendal v Arcos Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%203%20All%20ER%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 3 All ER 577.</a>
<P>

429	In<i> Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</i>, the authors make clear at 8-207
that the presumption that knowledge will be passed on from the agent to the
principal may be `nullified
by proof that the agent was defrauding the
principal in that transaction, whether or not the third party knew this;  it
can, in such
a case, be said that there was a moral certainty that the
information would not be communicated, or that communication would require
disclosure of the very fraud being practiced upon the principal by the agent
[the text contains a typographical error transposing
the words `agent' and
`principal'], or that the agent was not acting for the principal when he
received the information'.
<P>

430	In short, when the company is the victim of the conduct of particular
officers or servants, their knowledge and conduct may
not be imputed or
attributed to the company [see <i>Duke Group Ltd (In Liquidation) v Pilmer
&amp; Ors</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of South Australia, 30 January 1998,
Mullighan J)].
<P>

431	In <i>Cave v Cave</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1880%5d%2015%20Ch%20D%20639" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1880] 15 Ch D 639</a>, Fry J explained at 644 that this
exception may be put in the following two ways:
<P>

<i>	`In the one view notice is not imputed, because the circumstances are such
as not to raise the conclusion of law, which does ordinarily
arise from the
mere existence of notice to the agent;  in the other view . . . the act done by
the agent is such as cannot be said
to be done by him in his character of
agent, but is done by him in the character of a party to an independent fraud
on his principal,
and that is not to be imputed to the principal as an act done
by his agent.'</i>
<P>

432	I note that von Doussa J in <i>Beach Petroleum v Johnson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/283.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 283</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20115%20ALR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 115 ALR
411</a>, in acknowledging a difficulty with the above exception, sought to set
limits to the exception:
<P>

<i>	`I return to the Houghton principle.  It is one which may be applied
without difficulty where the company is the victim of the fraud
or misfeasance
of a director and does not gain any benefit from the transaction, as was the
situation in Re Hampshire Land Co, Houghton
and the Belmont Finance cases.  In
the Belmont Finance cases the common officers of the plaintiff and the two
defendant companies
who organised the illegal transaction would have been in
breach of fiduciary duty to the defendant companies in that they caused
them to
enter into an illegal transaction.  Yet this fact was not addressed in the
judgments.  What insulated the plaintiff, but
not the defendants, from having
the knowledge of those officers imputed to them was the fact that only the
plaintiff company was
treated as a victim.  The defendant companies were
parties who benefited by reason of the transaction.</i>
<P>

<i>	Difficulty arises where the director's fraud or misfeasance, whilst in some
aspects inimical to the interests of the company, nevertheless
achieves a
benefit for the company.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[at 571-572]
<P>

433	The limitation, being predicated on the circumstance where the fraudulent
officer acted within the scope of his or her actual
or apparent authority, was
described thus:
<P>

	<i>`If the director is guilty of fraudulent conduct which is not totally in
fraud of the corporation, and by design or result the fraud
partly benefits the
company, the knowledge of the director in the transaction will be attributed to
the company.'      </i>[115 ALR at 574]
<P>

434	Senior counsel for Cashflow and for CODFA characterised the Walters'
unauthorised payments in different terms.  Mr Campbell
QC, counsel for
Cashflow, submitted that the payments were an `unauthorised activity'.  Mr
Lindsay, senior counsel for CODFA, submitted
that the payments represented an
`unauthorised mode of carrying out an authorised activity'.  To my mind, Mr
Campbell's submission
is correct.  Mr Walters' actions fell outside the scope
of his actual or apparent authority as an employee or officer of Cashflow.
<P>

435	Use of the word `fraudulent' requires care when the state of mind of the
person of whom fraud is alleged is unclear.  In these
proceedings, the evidence
does not permit a finding as to precisely why Mr Walters acted as he did.  All
that the evidence establishes
is that his conduct was outside the scope of the
authority conferred upon him by either Cashflow or CODFA.  Using the above
description
to provide a dictionary for the use which follows of the words
`fraudulent' or fraud, to my mind, Mr Walters' conduct was clearly
fraudulent
and clearly represented gross breaches of duty owed relevantly to CODFA.  He
acted totally in fraud of CODFA.  He acted
totally in fraud of Cashflow.  His
knowledge was an element of his actions in fraud of both companies.  It is not
possible to impute
knowledge acquired by Mr Walters in his capacity as an
officer of CODFA to Cashflow in the circumstances of the evidence in this
case.
As Mr Campbell submitted at transcript 130, as Mr Walters wore two hats `even
if he were acting as the legitimate officer of
Cashflow in receiving the CODFA
funds, he would not tell himself that the payments were in breach of duties
which he owed to CODFA'.
<P>

436	I note that in <i>Farrow Finance Company Ltd (In Liquidation) v Farrow
Properties Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2026%20ACSR%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 26 ACSR 544</a> Hansen J at 587 extended the
criterion to cases of breach of fiduciary duty.  Referring to <i>Beach
Petroleum NL v Johnson </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/283.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 283</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2043%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 43 FCR 1</a>, a decision of von Doussa J, Hansen
J said:
<P>

<i>	`That discussion illustrates that in a case of fraud involving two
companies, both of which share a common director who is involved
in the fraud,
the knowledge of the director will be imputed to the company taking the benefit
of the fraud if the director was acting
within the scope of his or her actual
or apparent authority as a director of the benefiting company.  In my opinion,
that criterion
applies equally to a case not of fraud, but of breach of
fiduciary duty.'   [at p 587]</i>

<P>

	<i>`Viscount Haldane LC therefore regarded the identification of the directing
mind as primarily a <b>constitutional</b> question, depending in the first
instance upon the powers entrusted to a person by the articles of association.
The last sentence
about Mr Lennard's position shows that the position as
reflected in the articles may have to be supplemented by looking at the actual
exercise of the company's powers.  A person held out by the company as having
plenary authority or in whose exercise of such authority
the company
acquiesces, may be treated as its directing mind.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is well known that Viscount Haldane LC derived the concept of the
`directing mind' from German law (see Gower Principles of Modern
Company Law
(5th edn, 1992) p 194, n 36) which distinguishes between the agents and organs
of the company.  A German company with
limited liability (GmbH) is required by
law to appoint one or more directors (Gesch&auml;ftsfuhrer).  They are the
company's organs
and for legal purposes represent the company.  The knowledge
of any one director, however obtained, is the knowledge of the company
(see
Scholz Commentary on the GmbH Law (7th edn, 1986)), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 35).</a>  English law has
never taken the view that the knowledge of a director [is] ipso facto imputed
to the company:  see Powles v Page
<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1846/678.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1846] EngR 678</a>; (1846) 3 CB 15,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=136%20ER%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">136 ER 7</a> and Re Carew's

Unlike the German
Gesch&auml;ftsfuhrer, an English director may, as an individual, have no powers
whatever.  But English
law shares the view of German law that whether a person
is an organ or not depends upon the extent of the powers which in law he
has
express or implied authority to exercise on behalf of the company.'
</i>[(1994) 2 All ER at 705]
<P>

439	The doctrine attributes to the company the mind and will of the natural
person or persons who manage and control it's actions.
<P>

440	The parties were at issue as to whether as CODFA submitted, Mr Walters was
`the directing mind and will' of Cashflow concerning
the Walters' Unauthorised
Payments.  CODFA sought to rely in this regard on the decision in <i>El
Ajou.</i>
<P>

441	CODFA's contention faces an immediate difficulty already dealt with.  This
is that the knowledge of a person, whether sought
to be imputed to a
corporation by principles of principal and agent, or by the organic theory, is

<P>

442	<i>El Ajou</i> dealt with a particularly complex set of facts.  The
following description is taken from Ford and Austins<i> `Principles of
Corporations Law'</i> Butterworths, 1995, 7th edn at para 16.210:
<P>

	<i>`The plaintiff owned funds controlled by a Swiss investment manager who
improperly invested them in fraudulent schemes operated by
certain Canadians.
The operators of the schemes loaned the funds to the defendant (DLH), an
English company controlled off-shore
by Americans unconnected with the fraud
and their agent S. DLH was a holding company with directors who were mere
cyphers doing the
bidding of the overseas proprietors and S in the signing of
whatever documents they were instructed to sign.</i>
<P>

<i>	The plaintiff sued DLH for a declaration that it was liable as a
constructive trustee of the funds for the plaintiff on the grounds
that it had
received the funds knowing that they had been transferred out of the
plaintiff's account by the Swiss investment manager
in breach of fiduciary
duty.  The only basis for showing that DLH knew of the breach of duty was that
F, its chairman of directors,
knew of it.  But F acquired the knowledge when
acting for the Canadian operators of the fraudulent scheme and not when acting
as
an agent of DLH.  Millett J held that DLH was not fixed with F's knowledge.
The alternative basis for attributing knowledge was not
present because, in the
view of Millett J, F was not the directing mind and will of DLH.  He exercised
no independent judgment. 
He was chairman of a board of mere
nominee-directors.</i>
<P>

<i>	On appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed on the issue of whether F was the
directing mind and will.  The Court of Appeal focussed
attention on the
transactions by which DLH obtained the funds.  The activity of F, even though
under the direction of others, in
signing documents and otherwise committing
DLH was enough to make F the directing mind and will.'</i>
<P>

443	To my mind, the decision is clearly distinguishable from the facts in the
present case.  The directors of DLH were Mr Ferdman
(described in the above
extract as `F'), Mr Favre and Mr Jaton.  The trial judge described the three of
them as nominee directors
who represented the interests of the beneficial
owners and played no part in the conduct of DLH's business which was carried on
by
Mr Stern (described in the above extract as `S') in consultation with the
Americans.
<P>

444	The decision of the Court of Appeal turned on the fact that Mr Ferdman was
a director of DLH, was in a different position from
the two other directors and
critically, signed an agreement with Yulara Realty Ltd on behalf of DLH, and so
signed at the request
of Mr Stern whom he knew to be clothed with authority
from the Americans.  This appears most clearly from the judgment of Hoffman
LJ:
<P>

<i>	`The authorities show clearly that different persons may for different
purposes satisfy the requirements of being the company's directing
mind and
will.  Therefore the question in my judgment is whether in relation to the
Yulara transaction, Mr Ferdman as an individual
exercised powers on behalf of
the company which so identified him.  It seems to me that Mr Ferdman was
clearly regarded as being
in a different position from the other directors.
They were associates of his who came and went.  SAFI charged for their services
at a substantially lower rate.  It was Mr Ferdman who claimed in the published
accounts of DLH to be its ultimate beneficial owner.
 In my view, however, the
most significant fact is that Mr Ferdman signed the agreement with Yulara on
behalf of DLH.  There was
no board resolution authorising him to do so.  Of
course we know that in fact he signed at the request of Mr Stern, whom he knew
to be clothed with authority from the Americans.  But so far as the
constitution of DLH was concerned, he committed the company to
the transaction
as an autonomous act which the company adopted by performing the agreement.  I
would therefore hold, respectfully
differing from the judge, that this was
sufficient to justify Mr Ferdman being treated, in relation to the Yulara
transaction, as
the company's directing mind and will.'  [1994 2 All ER at
706]</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Nourse LJ said:
<P>

<i>	`In disagreeing with the judge on this question, I start from the position
that the transactions to be considered are those by which
DLH received assets
representing the moneys fraudulently misapplied.  The responsibility for the
management and control of those
transactions is not to be determined by
identifying those who were responsible for deciding that DLH would participate
in the Nine
Elms project and the nature and extent of that participation, far
less by identifying those who were responsible for business decisions
generally.  Neither Mr Stern nor the Americans made any of the arrangements for
the receipt or disbursement of the moneys by Grangewoods.
 Nor did they commit
DLH to the obligations correlative to their receipt.  None of them had the
authority to do so.  That was the
responsibility of Mr Ferdman.  The crucial
considerations are that Mr Ferdman made all the arrangements for the receipt
and disbursement
of the &#163;270,000 and the &#163;1,030,000;  that it was he
who signed the letter of 20 March to Roth;  that it was he who, on
25 March,
copied that letter to Mr D'Albis;  that it was he who signed and dispatched the
letter of 7 April to Yulara;  that it was
he who, on 6 May, signed the
agreement with Yulara;  and that it was those steps that caused DLH to become
involved in the project
and enabled it later to acquire the assets representing
the moneys fraudulently misapplied.</i>
<P>

<i>	Each of the steps taken by Mr Ferdman was taken without the authority of a
resolution of the board of DLH.  That demonstrates that
as between Mr Ferdman
on the one hand and Mr Favre and Mr Jaton on the other it was Mr Ferdman who
had the de facto management and
control of the transactions.  It may be that
that state of affairs involved some breach of the directors' duties to DLH.
But that
would not enable DLH to say that Mr Favre and Mr Jaton were parties to
its directing mind and will in any relevant respect.  Mr Tager
sought to show
that they did perform duties as directors of DLH.  No doubt they did.  But
there is no real evidence that they had
any responsibility for the
transactions in question.  In my view the directing mind and will of DLH in
relation to the relevant transactions
between March and June 1986 were the mind
and will of Mr Ferdman and none other.  That means that DLH had the requisite
knowledge
at that time.'  </i>   [[1994] 2 All ER at 696-697 para 16.210]
<P>

445	Ford and Austin express the view that:
<P>

<i>	`Ordinarily, the off-shore proprietors and S could have been seen to be the
directing mind and will.  Presumably, the view that F
was the directing mind
and will did not negate that.  The decision owed something to DLH being a
holding company with no business
of its own save being a conduit from its
proprietors to subsidiaries which did have businesses.  But even so, the
decision takes
an expansive view of the concept of directing mind and
will.'</i>    [at paragraph  16210]
<P>

446	The present is far removed from a case where a company had no business of
it's own.  Cashflow clearly had a business.  And plainly
Cashflow was never
committed by any act of Mr Walters to a formal contract dealing with loans from
CODFA.  Cashflow did not adopt
the transactions.  Mr Walters had no authority
whatever vested in him to commit Cashflow to any transaction involving
borrowings
from CODFA.  He was not a director of Cashflow.  He was not `the
directing mind and will' of Cashflow concerning any of the Walters'
Unauthorised Payments.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Finding as to Attribution of Knowledge</b>
<P>

447	In my judgment, the knowledge of Walters is not attributed to Cashflow in
the fashion forming an important basis for CODFA's
constructive trust
contentions.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Identifiable Trust Property</b>
<P>

448	Deane J in <i>Muschinski v Dodds</i> made plain that `the constructive
trust . . . demands the staple ingredients of [express and resulting or implied
trusts]:  subject
matter, beneficiary (or, conceivably, purpose), and personal
obligation attaching to property . . .'.  [1984 160 CLR at page 614]
<P>

449	<i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council
</i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] UKHL 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 669</a> involved an amount of &#163;2,500,000 paid by the bank to a
local authority pursuant to an interest swap agreement.  The agreement
was held
to be ultra vires the Council.  The bank sought to recover the moneys it had
paid the Council under the ineffective contract,
together with interest.  The
bank had entered the transaction with the intention of becoming a general
creditor of the Council. 
At issue before the House of Lords was whether the
interest should be simple or compound.  The question debated was whether the
bank's
right to recover the payment was personal or proprietary.
<P>

450	The majority holding was that on a claim at common law for recovery of
moneys paid in pursuance of an ineffective contract the
claimant was entitled
under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 to simple interest only;  that
in the absence of fraud equity
had never awarded compound interest except
against a trustee or other person in a fiduciary position in respect of profits
improperly
made;  that the recipient of moneys under a contract subsequently
held void for mistake or as being ultra vires did not hold those
moneys on a
resulting trust and it would be undesirable so to develop the law of resulting
trusts since to do so would give the claimant
a proprietary interest in the
moneys and produce injustice to third parties and commercial uncertainty;  and
that the council was
not otherwise in a fiduciary position vis-a-vis the
bank.'
<P>

451	In <i>Westdeutsche Bank</i> Lord Browne Wilkinson, with whose judgment Lord
Slynn of Hadley and Lord Lloyd of Berwick agreed, set out four propositions
which
are fundamental to the law of trusts.  The third deals with the need for
there to be identifiable trust property.  The four propositions
are:
<P>

<i>	`(i)	Equity operates on the conscience of the owner of the legal interest.
In the case of a trust the conscience of the legal owner
requires him to carry
out the purposes for which the property was vested in him (express or implied
trust) or which the law imposes
on him by reason of his unconscionable conduct
(constructive trust).</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	Since the equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends upon the
conscience of the holder of the legal interest being affected,
he cannot be a
trustee of the property if and so long as he is ignorant of the facts alleged
to affect his conscience, i.e. until
he is aware that he is intended to hold
the property for the benefit of others in the case of an express or implied
trust, or, in
the case of a constructive trust, of the factors which are
alleged to affect his conscience.  [But see the expansion of this proposition
dealt with at 705G and following.]</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	In order to establish a trust there must be identifiable trust
property.  The only apparent exception to this rule is a constructive
trust
imposed on a person who dishonestly assists in a breach of trust who may come
under fiduciary duties even if he does not receive
identifiable trust
property.</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	Once a trust is established, as from the date of its establishment the
beneficiary has, in equity, a proprietary interest in
the trust property, which
proprietary interest will be enforceable in equity against any subsequent
holder of the property (whether
the original property or substituted property
into which it can be traced) other than a purchaser for value of the legal
interest
without notice.'</i>
<P>

452	Tracing is of course an evidence finding activity having as its object, the
identification of the property the subject of the
restitutionary claim.  <i>Cf
Re Montagu's Settlement Trusts</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Ch%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Ch 264</a> per Megarry V-C at 285.
<P>

<i>	`Tracing properly so called, however, is neither a claim nor a remedy but a
process.  Moreover it is not confined to the case where
the plaintiff seeks a
proprietary remedy;  it is equally necessary where he seeks a personal remedy
against the knowing recipient
or knowing assistant.  It is the process by which
the plaintiff traces what has happened to his property, identifies the persons
who have handled or received it, and justifies his claim that the money that
they handled or received (and if necessary, which they
still retain) can
properly be regarded as representing his property.  He needs to do this because
his claim is based on the retention
by him of a beneficial interest in the
property which the defendant handled or received.  Unless he can prove this he
cannot (in
the traditional language of equity) raise an equity against the
defendant or (in the modern language of restitution) show that the
defendant's
unjust enrichment was at his expense.'  </i> [<i>Boscawen v Bajwa</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] EWCA Civ 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1
WLR 328</a> at 334 per Millett LJ]
<P>

453	I accept as correct, Mr Campbell's submission that it is insufficient for
CODFA's purposes, to prove that there was <u>once</u> property received by
Cashflow which at the time of receipt, or soon after, was subject to a
constructive trust.  Hence what CODFA
must prove, if it is to establish that
there is any property which is now held by Cashflow and is to be declared as
subject to a
constructive trust, is that there is still held by Cashflow
property subject to such trust.
<P>

454	I accept Mr Campbell's further submission that there is no allegation in
the pleadings, nor any evidence of, any specific funds
now in the hands of
Cashflow, upon which any constructive trust could fasten.  This was indeed not
in issue.  CODFA's written submissions
earlier set out [see para 406], in fact
stated that `CODFA is not seeking "to trace funds through Cashflow".'
<P>

455	No allegation was made or pursued by CODFA to the effect that all or part
of the business of Cashflow was built up by use of
the moneys misappropriated
from CODFA, such that a constructive trust should be declared over all or part
of the goodwill of Cashflow's
business.  Compare for example the claims to such
a constructive trust which were made in <i>Hospital Products [supra]</i>.  And
see <i>Timber Engineering Co Pty Ltd v Anderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20488" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 488.</a>
Presumably this is because Cashflow has a deficiency of $1,622,083 in which
event goodwill may be non-existent or negligible.  Alternatively,
the
circumstances leading to these proceedings may explain that no goodwill exists
or that CODFA was not able to make good such a
claim.
<P>

456	CODFA has not been able on the evidence to make out it's claim that any
property to which it can point as having been in Cashflow's
hands at the start
of the liquidation, is subject to a constructive trust.  Had such a claim been
made good, that property would
fall outside the assets administered by the
liquidator.
<P>

457	Nor can I accept that upon the Court by order avoiding the payments made by
Cashflow to CODFA as preferential payments or as
uncommercial transactions, the
Court could or must order that such moneys, at the moment they are paid to
Cashflow, become impressed
with a constructive trust.
<P>

458	CODFA's arguments in support of this analysis fail at a number of
levels.
<P>

459	The first is that the reasons advanced in favour of such a trust `undercut
the well settled principles founding insolvency law'.

Elizabethan Theatre Trust</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/344.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 344</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2030%20FCR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 30 FCR 491</a> per Gummow J].
<P>

460	In <i>Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 371</a>, an
investor, Dr David Daly, had sought the advice of a firm of stockbrokers,
Patrick Partners, about shares in which he might invest.
 At the time the firm,
although apparently prosperous, was in a parlous financial position, and this
was known to the partners. 
An employee, who was not aware of the firm's
position, advised Dr Daly that it was not a good time to buy shares and that he
should
place the money on deposit with the firm until the time was right to
buy.  Dr Daly, lent the money to Patrick Partners, at interest.
 Patrick
Partners subsequently ceased trading and was unable to repay the loan.  The
case involved an application by Dr Daly to recover
compensation from the
Fidelity Fund, established by section 97(1) of the <i>Securities Industry
Act</i> <i>1975 (NSW).</i>
<P>

461	The High Court held that a fiduciary relationship existed between Dr Daly
and Patrick Partners and that Patrick Partners had
been in breach of duty in
not disclosing it's unsatisfactory financial position to Dr Daly.  However, the
Court held that the moneys
deposited with Patrick Partners were not the subject
of a constructive trust in favour of Dr Daly and had accordingly not been
received
by the firm as a trustee within section 97(1)(b)(ii).  Gibbs CJ,
Wilson and Dawson JJ held that it was not necessary to find that
a constructive
trust existed in order to ensure that Patrick Partners was not unjustly
enriched.  The benefit that Patrick Partners
obtained in consequence of it's
breach of fiduciary duty was held to be a loan of money such that as a debtor,
it was bound to repay
the debt to the creditor.
<P>

462	Gibbs CJ referred to the effect of the constructive trust in withdrawing
assets from the general body of creditors:
<P>

<i>	`. . . the consequences of holding the money to be subject to a
constructive trust and thereby transforming the creditor into a beneficiary
suggest that it would be contrary to principle to recognize the existence of a
constructive trust in a case such as the present.
 One consequence would be
that the money, and any property acquired with it, would, on the firm's
bankruptcy, be withdrawn from the
general body of creditors . . . For the
reasons I have given, and particularly because the existence of a constructive
trust was
on the one hand unnecessary to protect the legitimate rights of the
lender and on the other hand could lead to consequences unjust
both to the
creditors of the borrower and the borrower itself, I hold that no constructive
trust came into existence when the moneys
were paid by Dr Daly to Patrick
Partners.'</i>

<P>

463	CODFA's submissions raise centrally the question as to in what
circumstances a claimant to the assets of an insolvent company
is able to claim
priority over the general creditors by means of a proprietary claim and what
the present state of the law in Australia
on this topic is.
<P>

464	The respective submissions as to <i>Black v S Freedman and Co</i> have
already been set out.  It is clear that money stolen `is trust money in the
hands of the thief'.

<P>

465	I accept that the constructive trust arises as soon as the thief takes the
property.  And as Ford and Lee point out at paragraph
22430, `persons who
receive the proceeds of a theft, or property into which proceeds can be traced,
otherwise than as bona fide purchasers
for value without notice, will hold on a
constructive trust for the victim of the theft (<i>Fowkes v Deputy Director of
Public Prosecutions</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20VR%20506" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 VR 506)</a>, or will be personally liable to pay
compensation for knowing receipt'.
<P>

466	I do not see that the closely argued question as to whether or not the
appellation `stolen' is appropriately used in respect
of the paid funds is
determinative of any issue.  The finding is that there was both an unauthorised
payment of the moneys by Mr
Walters having utilised his access to the CODFA
bank account and an unauthorised receipt of the moneys by Mr Walters using his
access
to the Cashflow account.
<P>

467	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that any purpose that Mr Walters
had in connection with the use of the paid funds
cannot be decided on the state
of the evidence and is not one of which the directors of Cashflow knew or
approved.  While one possible
theory as to Mr Walters' motivation is plainly
that he wished to help Cashflow, Cashflow does not admit that this was his
motivation
and the case remains one in respect of which his motivation remains
a mystery.
<P>

468	In <i>Westdeutsche Bank</i>, Lord Browne Wilkinson expressly rejects an
argument put by Professor Birks that a resulting trust ought arise whenever
money is
paid under a mistake of fact [1996 AC at 708-709].
<P>

469	Lord Browne Wilkinson recognised that a thief holds property on a
constructive trust but accepts that the reason for this is
his own fraud and
that the effect of this is that the property is traceable in equity.
<P>

	<i>`The argument for a resulting trust was said to be supported by the case of
a thief who steals a bag of coins.  At law those coins
remain traceable only so
long as they are kept separate;  as soon as they are mixed with other coins or
paid into a mixed bank account
they cease to be traceable at law.  Can it
really be the case, it is asked, that in such circumstances the thief cannot be
required
to disgorge the property which, in equity, represents the stolen
coins?  Moneys can only be traced in equity if there has been at
some stage a
breach of fiduciary duty, i.e. if either before the theft there was an
equitable proprietary interest (e.g. the coins
were stolen trust moneys) or
such interest arises under a resulting trust at the time of the theft or the
mixing of the moneys. 
Therefore, it is said, a resulting trust must arise
either at the time of the theft or when the moneys are subsequently mixed.
Unless
this is the law, there will be no right to recover the assets
representing the stolen moneys once the moneys have become mixed.</i>
<P>

<i>	I agree that the stolen moneys are traceable in equity.  But the
proprietary interest which equity is enforcing in such circumstances
arises
under a constructive, not a resulting, trust.  Although it is difficult to find
clear authority for the proposition, when
property is obtained by fraud equity
imposes a constructive trust on the fraudulent recipient:  the property is
recoverable and traceable
in equity.  Thus, an infant who has obtained property
by fraud is bound in equity to restore it:  Stocks v Wilson [1913] 2 K.B. 235,
244;  R. Leslie Ltd v Sheill [1914] 3 K.B. 607.  Moneys stolen from a bank
account can be traced in equity:  Bankers Trust Co. v
Shapira [1980] 1 W.L.R.
1274, 1282C-E:  see also McCormick v Grogan (1869) <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1869/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1869] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=LR%204%20HL%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">L.R. 4 H.L. 82</a>, 97.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[1996 AC at 715-716]
<P>

470	The difficulty for CODFA which accepts that it is now unable to trace the
moneys paid to Cashflow, is to overcome the principle
that in such a
circumstance a claimant is unable to claim by way of constructive trust and is
left with only a personal remedy.
<P>

471	I do not accept that where a bankrupt estate has been swollen by an amount
for which the claimant could have claimed against
the bankrupt, the claimant is
entitled to claim priority over unsecured creditors, notwithstanding that the
claimant cannot trace
the original property into property vested in the trustee
in bankruptcy.  There is no authority binding upon this Court to so hold.
Nevertheless the authorities on the subject require careful examination.
<P>

472	In an article `Proprietary Claims and their Priority in Insolvency' by A.J.
Oakley  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%20CLJ%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995 CLJ 377</a>, the author makes the point that a person who seeks to
assert an equitable proprietary claim will be relying on the existence of
an
equitable proprietary interest in the property in question.  That equitable
proprietary interest may arise in a variety of ways;
 under an express trust,
by virtue of a resulting trust, by virtue of the imposition of a constructive
trust, or as a result of a
void, voidable or mistaken transaction.
<P>

473	The author continues:
<P>

	<i>`No matter how the equitable proprietary interest has arisen, the effect of
a successful equitable proprietary claim is the same;
 the other party will
hold the property on trust for the claimant to give effect to his equitable
proprietary interest therein. 
If the claimant is able to show that any
particular item of property in the hands of the other party is, in equity,
either entirely
his own property or entirely the product of his own property,
he will obviously be able to call for that property to be transferred
to him.
If, on the other hand, he is only able to show that any particular item of
property in the hands of the other party is partially
the product of his own
property, then he will normally have alien or charge over that item of property
for the amount of his contribution
thereto and will enjoy the rights
appropriate to the holder of such an interest in the type of property in
question.  Because mixing
the property or its product with other money is no
bar to an equitable proprietary claim, that claim can proceed despite the fact
that the property in question has passed into the general assets of the person
against whom the claim is being brought.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is therefore apparent that the sudden appearance of an equitable
proprietary claim to an asset which appears to be the beneficial
property of
the person against whom the claim is being brought is capable of causing
considerable prejudice to his general creditors
in the event of his bankruptcy.
Where the claimant has a clearly established pre-existing equitable proprietary
interest such as,
for example, a beneficial interest under an express trust,
the priority conferred on that beneficiary causes no more prejudice to
the
general creditors than the priority conferred in the case of a legal
proprietary claim.  As Lord Templeman said in Space Investments
v Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce Trust Company (Bahamas) <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1986/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%203%20All%20ER%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 3 All ER 75</a> at 76-77.
"This priority is conferred because the . . . unsecured creditors voluntarily
accept the risk that the trustee bank might
become insolvent and unable to
discharge its obligations in full.  On the other hand, the settler of the trust
and the beneficiaries
interested under the trust never accept any risks
involved in the possible insolvency of the trustee bank".  The potential
prejudice
to the general creditors arises out of the possibility of an
equitable proprietary interest actually being created by the imposition
of a
constructive trust on property which appears to any outsider to be beneficial
property of the bankrupt . . . The question of
whether or not the Courts are
willing to impose constructive trusts in such circumstances determines if
equitable proprietary claims
in fact unduly prejudice the interests of general
creditors.'   </i>[At pages 380-381]

474	In <i>Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20WLR%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980]
2 WLR 202</a>, the plaintiff New York Bank, as the result of a clerical error, made
twice rather than once a payment of $US2million to another
New York Bank for
the creditor of the defendant London Bank, which subsequently became insolvent.
The plaintiff duly proved in the
liquidation in respect of the second payment
made under a mistake of fact, but this gave no priority over the other
creditors of
the defendant.  The plaintiff therefore, also claimed to be
entitled to trace the second payment in equity against the defendant.
 The
legal effects of the mistaken payment had to be determined in accordance with
the law of the State of New York, where a payment
under a mistake of fact of
money which the payee cannot conscientiously withhold gives rise to the
imposition of a constructive trust.
 Goulding J held that this was `also in
accord with the general principles of equity as applied in England' [at 208].
His Lordship
justified this conclusion on the grounds that `a person who pays
money to another under a factual mistake retains an equitable property
in it
and the conscience of that other is subjected to a fiduciary duty to respect
his proprietary right' [at page 209].  [See the
article by A.J. Oakley at p

475	The decision in <i>Chase Manhattan Bank</i>, was applied by the Court of
Appeal of New Zealand in re <i>Liggett v Kensington</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20NZLR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 NZLR 257</a> which
was reversed by the Privy Council [sub nom.  In <i>re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</i>
[1994] 3 WLR 199.]  There, a gold dealer had offered its purchasers the option
of leaving their bullion in its custody on the purchaser's
behalf as `non
allocated bullion'.  The majority of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand imposed
fiduciary obligations on the gold
dealer.  Purchasers who accepted this option
were issued with a certificate of ownership and were entitled to take physical
possession
of their bullion on seven days notice.  The gold dealer subsequently
became bankrupt and the question for decision was as to whether
such purchasers
were entitled to an equitable proprietary claim in priority to a debenture
holder.  The conclusion that the company
was a fiduciary (and that the
purchasers consequently had priority) was based on the propositions firstly
that it was bound to protect
the interests of the purchasers and, secondly,
that it was, for all practical purposes, free from control and supervision by
the
purchasers.  The Privy Council, as A.J. Oakley at 394 reminds us, referred
to the warnings given many decades ago by Lindley LJ in
<i>Manchester Trust v
Furness</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%202%20QB%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 2 QB 539</a> at 545 and by Atkin LJ in <i>Re Wait</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%201%20Ch%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927] 1
Ch 606</a> at 634 and following, of the dangers of applying equitable doctrines to
commercial transactions and paid heed to those warnings.
 Lord Mustill said:
<P>

	<i>`But what kind of fiduciary duties did the company owe to the customer?
None have been suggested beyond those which the company assumed
under the
contracts of sale read with the collateral promises . . . No doubt the fact
that one person is placed in a particular position
vis a vis another through
the medium of a contract does not necessarily mean that he does not also owe
fiduciary duties to that other
by virtue of being in that position.  But the
essence of a fiduciary relationship is that it creates obligations of a
different character
from those deriving from the contract itself . . . Many
commercial relationships involve just such a reliance by one party on the
other, and to introduce the whole new dimension into such relationships which
would flow from giving them a fiduciary character would
(as it seems to their
Lordships) have adverse consequences far exceeding those foreseen by Atkin LJ
in Re Wait.  It is possible without
misuse of language to say that the
customers put faith in the company, and that their trust has not been repaid.
But the vocabulary
is misleading;  high expectations do not necessarily lead to
equitable remedies'.      </i>[[1994] 3 WLR 199 at 216]
<P>

476	<i>Chase Manhattan Bank</i> is to be properly regarded as an example of a
situation `where a constructive trust was imposed on money or other property
which
is acquired by a non-fiduciary otherwise than by contract'.  [<i>Daly v
Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd</i>, per Brennan J at 391]
<P>

477	In re <i>Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</i>, the Privy Council reserved the question
of whether <i>Chase Manhattan</i> was correctly decided, but made the point
that the practicability of tracing remained an important integer:
<P>

	<i>`It may be - their Lordships express no opinion upon it - that the Chase
Manhattan case correctly decided that where one party mistakenly
makes the same
payment twice it retains a proprietary interest in the second payment which (if
tracing is practicable) can be enforced
against the payees' assets in a
liquidation ahead of unsecured creditors.'    </i>[1994 3 WLR 199 at 221]
<P>

478	The decision in <i>Chase Manhattan</i> has in effect been overruled by the
House of Lords in <i>Westdeutsche</i> to which reference has already been made.
Hence, it is appropriate to regard Lord Browne Wilkinson to have
authoritatively rejected
the proposition that, without more, receipt of money
paid under a mistake renders the recipient a trustee and leaves the payee
holding
an equitable proprietary right in the money.  <i>Jacobs Law of Trusts
in Australia</i>, 6th ed, Butterworths 1997 edited by R.P. Meagher and W.M.G.
Gummow at paragraph 2704
<P>

479	Although Lord Templeman's statements of principle in <i>Space Investments
Ltd v Canadian Imperial Bank Commerce Trust Co (Bahamas)</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1986/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%203%20All%20ER%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 3 All ER 75</a>
do not appear to have been confined to a situation where tracing was possible,
the later decision of the Privy Council in re <i>Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</i>,
where Lord Templeman was a member of the Board, so confined Lord Templeman's
dicta.  In <i>Space Investments</i>, Lord Templeman had said:
<P>

	<i>`A bank in fact uses all deposit moneys for the general purposes of the
bank.  Whether a bank trustee lawfully receives deposits or
wrongly treats
trust money as on deposit from trusts, all the moneys are in fact dealt with
and expended by the bank for the general
purposes of the bank.  In these
circumstances it is impossible for the beneficiaries interested in trust money
misappropriated from
their trust to trace their money to any particular asset
belonging to the trustee bank.  But equity allows the beneficiaries, or
a new
trustee appointed in place of an insolvent bank trustee to protect the
interests of the beneficiaries, to trace the trust money
to all the assets of
the bank and to recover the trust money by the exercise of an equitable charge
over all the assets of the bank.
 Where an insolvent bank goes into liquidation
that equitable charge secures for the beneficiaries and the trust priority over
the
claims of the customers in respect of their deposits and over the claims of
all other unsecured creditors.  This priority is conferred
because the
customers and other unsecured creditors voluntarily accept the risk that the
trustee bank might become insolvent and
unable to discharge its obligations in
full.  On the other hand, the settlor of the trust and the beneficiaries
interested under
the trust never accept any risks involved in the possible
insolvency of the trustee bank.  On the contrary, the settlor could be
certain
that if the trusts were lawfully administered the trustee bank could never make
use of trust money for its own purposes and
would always be obliged to
segregate trust money and trust property in the manner authorised by law and by
the trust instrument free
from any risks involved in the possible insolvency of
the trustee bank.  It is therefore equitable that where the trustee bank has
unlawfully misappropriated trust money by treating the trust money as though it
belonged to the bank beneficially, merely acknowledging
and recording the
amount in a trust deposit account with the bank, then the claims of the
beneficiaries should be paid in full out
of the assets of the trustee bank in
priority to the claims of the customers and other unsecured creditors of the
bank:  `". . .
if a man mixes trust funds with his own, the whole will be
treated as the trust property" . . . that is, that the trust property
comes
first'  (per Jessel MR in Re Hallett's Estate, Knatchbull v Hallett  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2013%20Ch%20D%20696" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 13

earlier pronouncements to the same effect).  Where a bank trustee is insolvent,
trust money wrongfully
treated as being on deposit with the bank must be repaid
in full so far as may be out of the assets of the bank in priority to any
payment of customers' deposits and other unsecured debts.'</i>
<P>

<P>

In <i>Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</i>, Lord Mustill delivering the judgment for
the Board said:
<P>

	<i>`For these reasons the Board must reject all the ways in which the
non-allocated claimants assert a proprietary interest over the
purchase price
and its fruits.  This makes it unnecessary to consider whether, if such an
interest had existed, it would have been
possible to trace from the subject
matter of the interest into the company's present assets.  Indeed it would be
unprofitable to
do so without a clear understanding of when and how the
equitable interest arose, and of its nature.  Their Lordships should, however,
say that they find it difficult to understand how the judgment of the Board in
Space Investments Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce Trust Co.
(Bahamas) Ltd. <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1986/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] UKPC 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20WLR%201072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 W.L.R. 1072</a>, on which the claimants leaned heavily in
argument, would enable them to overcome the difficulty that the moneys said to
be impressed
with the trust were paid into an overdrawn account and thereupon
ceased to exist:  see, for example, In re Diplock  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%20Ch%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] Ch. 465.</a>  The
observations of the Board in the Space Investments case were concerned with a
mixed, not a non-existent, fund.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>[1994, 3 WLR at p 222]
<P>

480	In any event, ultimately the nature of the case must always determine the
appropriate remedy;  <i>Maguire v Makaronis</i> (<i>supra</i>) at 467 per
Brennan CJ and Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.  No case has been made out by
CODFA for an order of the type referred to
in paragraph 457.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's claim that absent an entitlement in it to proprietary relief,
Cashflow (and Mr Star) have a continuing obligation to restore
CODFA's
estate.</b>
<P>

481	I reject CODFA's claim that absent an entitlement in it to proprietary
relief, it is entitled to `rank above' the general unsecured
creditors of
Cashflow.  At its highest, this claim is grounded upon the suggested principle
that the obligation of a defaulting fiduciary
is essentialy a personal
obligation of effecting restitution to the estate of his principal.  Naturally,
I accept that a plaintiff
who establishes a breach of fiduciary duty, has
available to him a range of remedies including the remedy of account.  But
assuming
in CODFA's favour that Cashflow is for relevant purposes to be classed
as a fiduciary, the circumstances of Cashflow's insolvency
leave CODFA in the
same position as other unsecured creditors.
<P>

	<b>Is the Obligation to make Restitution a Post-liquidation Obligation?</b>
<P>

482	To my mind, the analysis given in Cashflow's submissions earlier set out
[paragraph 411] is correct.  Cashflow's liability to
account is not a
post-liquidation liability and is not entitled to priority under section
556(1)(a) Corporations Law.
<P>

483	Any obligation of Cashflow to make restitution in relation to the WUPs does
not, I accept, fit within the language used in section
556(1)(a) Corporations
Law.  It is not an `expense incurred'.  The only possible `relevant authority'
is the liquidator.  It was
not he who here incurred the restitutionary
obligation to repay the WUPs.  Additionally, the restitutionary obligation to
repay the
WUPs has not, I accept, been incurred `in preserving, realising or
getting in property of the company, or in carrying on the company's
business'.
<P>

484	The so-called `concession' is dealt with hereunder.  The obligation to make
restitution of money paid does not arise from the
fact that Cashflow admitted
that obligation in the course of the present litigation.  Nor was it, I accept,
necessary for Cashflow
to have knowledge of the circumstances of the payments
before it became under a restitutionary obligation.
<P>

485	In <i>David Securities Pty Limited v Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
</i>Brennan J said, as has earlier been pointed out, that:
<P>

	<i>`If, under a mistake, money is paid to and unjustly enriches a payee, the
payee's right to recover the amount accrues at the moment
when the payee
received the money.'</i>
<P>

486	I further accept as correct Cashflow's submission that in relation to those
of the WUPs where there was payment direct from
CODFA to a solvent client of
Cashflow, the obligation to make restitution arose either when the payment was
made by CODFA, or alternatively
at the latest when Cashflow received a benefit
arising from that payment.
<P>

487	For the reasons given by Cashflow in its submission set out in paragraphs
6.1-6.25 [see paragraph 411 Judgment], the obligation
to make restitution in
relation to the WUPs made to solvent clients, arose well before liquidation.
<P>

	<b>Is the Obligation to make Restitution one which is provable in the winding
up?</b>
<P>

488	I accept as correct Cashflow's submissions on this topic set out in
Judgment paragraph 411.  Under Corporations Law sections
553 and 554A allowing
the proof of unliquidated claims, it is clear that the obligation of Cashflow
to make restitution to CODFA
in relation to the WUPs gives rise to a claim
which is provable in the winding up of Cashflow.
<P>

489	I accept that a claim for restitution of money paid to or to the use of a
person who has become bankrupt is a claim which is
provable in a bankruptcy.
It is a liquidated claim.  I further accept that CODFA's claim to an account is
here in reality a claim
to receive back the money it had parted with.
<P>

490	Unliquidated damages are provable in the winding up of insolvent companies.
Section 553E Corporations Law provides that this
right is subject to section
82(2) <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a></i>.  That section provides that demands in the
nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract,
promise
or breach of trust, are not provable in bankruptcy.  That limitation on
the ability to prove which is contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 82(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy
Act 1966</a>,</i> I accept, should be construed narrowly.  The expression `by
reason of' in that section I accept, indicates that it is not necessary
to
establish more than an appropriate nexus between the damages claimed and the
contract or promise.  [Cf <i>Australian Corporations Law</i>, Butterworths,
1991 volume 2 paragraph 5.6.0225]
<P>

	<b>Is a personal obligation of a fiduciary to make good a loss, one which is
provable in the winding up of the fiduciary?</b>
<P>

491	Whether or not in the circumstances proven, Cashflow owes fiduciary
obligations in relation to the Walters' unauthorised payments.
 I accept that
all that any fiduciary obligation to account results in, is a personal
obligation on the fiduciary to pay money. 
Hence, if the fiduciary becomes
insolvent, that personal obligation permits of a proof of debt.
<P>

492	Section 82(2) <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i> makes clear that a personal liability
of a trustee to make restitution for breach of trust is provable in the
bankruptcy.  I accept
Cashflow's submission that if that species of fiduciary
obligation is provable in the bankruptcy, it is consistent that an action
for
other types of breach of fiduciary duty ought also be provable in the
bankruptcy.
<P>

493	Ultimately, as Cashflow submitted, it is the effect of sections 553 and
554A Corporations Law that any doubts that there might
be about whether all and
every claim for breach of fiduciary duty is provable in the winding up of a
corporation (including claims
which are in the nature of unliquidated claims)
has been removed.
<P>

	<b>The `Concession'</b>
<P>

494	I do not see that the 15 March 1999 statements by Mr Campbell QC from the
Bar table alter the antecedent position in any material
way.  The relevant
concession was made in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>`His Honour:	Well, does this raise the question which you or Mr Lindsay
has, or both in your issues, namely what sort of benefit can
be sheeted home,
if any to Cashflow in terms of the whole exercise as opposed to it simply being
entitled to claim that every cent
it paid to Transpac No 2 is money had and
received to the full dollar?</i>
<P>

<i>Campbell:	Your Honour I can say now what I told my friend before Court this
morning and that is not something that will be troubling
your Honour . . .  If
I could take your Honour to our outline of submissions concerning CODFA.  They
have annexed to them an annotated
version of GMG4 . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Campbell:	That sets out material which is common ground about how money
flowed from CODFA, Cashflow and certain of Cashflow's clients.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Campbell:	What we accept is that if the payment was received in the Cashflow
bank account from CODFA then there is an obligation to
make restitution of the
amount that has been received . . .'    </i>[Transcript of 15 March 1999 at
pages 29 and 30]
<P>

<i>`Campbell:	The third category then is one transaction.  Your Honour will
find it referred to at the top of page 4 of . . . GMG4.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:	$20,000?</i>
<P>

<i>Campbell:  Yes, paid off $20,000, which was made direct from CODFA to
Transpac.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Campbell:	That is a transaction which we say we have no obligation to make
restitution in relation to because we didn't actually receive
it and now that
we have the knowledge of the circumstances in which it was made, we do not
elect to treat it as binding on us.' 
  </i>[Transcript 15 March 1999 at page
31]
<P>

Campbell, referring to the written overview submissions of Cashflow on 15 March
1999 at transcript page 59:
<P>

<i>	`At 1.2 we say that for the purpose of the avoidance claims, you need to
decide just which of the Walters' unauthorised payments
are ones which gave
CODFA a right of restitution and the reason why that is so is because of [sic]
in relation to any particular
claim CODFA had a right of restitution, then that
is a right of restitution that arose the instant payment was made . . .'
</i>[Transcript page 59]
<P>

495	Both before and after the making of these statements, Cashflow had an
obligation to make restitution to CODFA of an amount equivalent
to CODFA's
payments made without consideration to Cashflow.  That obligation is one in
respect of which, in the absence of CODFA
being able to trace the moneys paid
to Cashflow or to identify any profits said to flow from Cashflow's use of such
moneys, CODFA
must prove in Cashflow's liquidation.
<P>

	<b>The Amounts Owing between Cashflow and CODFA</b>
<P>

<b>	The Liquidator of Cashflow's Avoidance Claims against CODFA</b>
<P>

496	I accept Cashflow's submission that the result that the Court reaches in
proceedings 50177 of 1997 will depend upon which of
the payments which were
made from Cashflow's funds to CODFA are set aside as preferences or otherwise
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> of the Corporations Law.
<P>

497	The reason of principle why this is the case is that any balance of account
that is found to be owing one way or another in
those proceedings, will relate
only to whichever of those transactions have not been avoided.
<P>

498	If for example, it were to be found that the payment of $100,000 which is
dated 9 August 1996, made by Cashflow to CODFA was
a preference, and was the
only payment which could be avoided as a preference or uncommercial
transaction, CODFA would have to repay
that $100,000 to the liquidator,
arguably together with interest.  The August 1996 payment of $100,000 having
upon this basis been
set aside as void, it would then disappear from
consideration in working out what was owed by CODFA to Cashflow (or vice versa)
in
proceedings 50177 of 1997.
<P>

499	If for example, it were to be found that CODFA owed $X to Cashflow, as a
result of the transactions that remained to be considered
in proceedings 50177
of 1997, CODFA would be ordered to pay $X (arguably plus interest), in addition
to refunding the preference
(plus interest).
<P>

500	If it were to be found that Cashflow owed $Y to CODFA, as a result of the
transactions that remain to be considered in proceedings
50177 of 1997, then
CODFA would have a right of proof in the liquidation of Cashflow for $Y (plus
such interest as could properly
be admitted to proof), and would have an
additional right of proof in relation to the $100,000 that had been held to be
a preference.
<P>

501	Hence, the liquidators' avoidance claims must logically be considered
before one considers the claims in proceedings 50177 of
1997.
<P>

502	I accept also Cashflow's analysis which is that for the purpose of
considering the various avoidance claims, it is necessary
to come to a view
about which of the payments from CODFA's account are ones which conferred on
CODFA a right of restitution.  This,
I accept, is because if there was a right
of restitution in CODFA at any time, that right needs to be taken into account
in considering
the liabilities of Cashflow at that time.
<P>

503	Reference has already been made to Cashflow's description of certain
payments as `the Walters unauthorised payments' [WUPs].
 This use of
terminology was adopted by Cashflow in an attempt to avoid presupposing the
answer to a vital question which needs to
be determined.  That question is
whether the payments between the various accounts constitute a running account.
Hence, the various
payments which passed between Cashflow and CODFA, the
Burkett account and various of the Cashflow's clients are generally referred
to
in Cashflow's submissions and have been referred to thus far in the Judgment as
`WUPs'.
<P>

504	It is common ground that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> of the Corporations Law commenced on 23
June 1993.  All the relevant events concerning the claims brought in
proceedings [50047 of
1998] occurred after that date, hence <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a>
Corporations Law contains the law to be applied to them.
<P>

	<b>Preferences</b>
<P>

505	Cashflow's claim relates to payments of $498,506 made during the six months
before the Relation Back Day.  Those payments can
be identified as items 14 to
23 inclusive in schedule 2 to the amended statement of claim in proceedings
50177 of 1997.
<P>

	<b>The WUPs do not Constitute an Integral Part of a Continuing Business
Relationship</b>
<P>

506	I accept that Cashflow's preference claim will succeed for the entire
amount only if the WUPs are held not to constitute an
integral part of a
continuing business relationship between Cashflow and a creditor of
Cashflow.
<P>

507	Section 588FA(3) now codifies the law about what series of transactions are
treated in the same way that a running account used
to be treated for the
purpose of the law concerning preferences.  Cashflow's submission is that it
ought not be held that the WUPs
fall within section 588FA(3).  I accept that
submission.  The reasons for this holding follow.
<P>

508	The notion of `an integral part of a continuing business relationship'
requires that there be acts of Cashflow, and acts of
CODFA, entered into
deliberately, to make up the relationship.  I accept that the situation where
Walters was, unauthorised, passing
the money of one company to the other, does
not meet this description.  Hence section 588FA(3)(a) is not satisfied.
<P>

509	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that while it is true that the
level of indebtedness of Cashflow to CODFA has in fact
increased and reduced
from time to time, it cannot be said that that increase and reduction is `as a
result of a series of transactions
forming part of the relationship'.  It was
no part, I accept, of the business relationship between Cashflow and CODFA that
Walters
should make the WUPs.
<P>

510	The only example which section 588FA(3) gives of a transaction which falls
within it's scope, is a running account.  The WUPs
do not constitute a running
account as that term has previously been used in the law of preferences.
<P>

511	In <i>Air Services Australia v Ferrier</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20185%20CLR%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 185 CLR 483</a>, Dawson,
Gaudron and McHugh JJ put the matter as follows at pages 504-506:
<P>

	<i>`Since the decision of this Court in Richardson v Commercial Banking Co of
Sydney Ltd . . . the term "running account" has achieved
almost talismanic
significance in determining when the ultimate, rather than the immediate and
isolated, effect of a payment is to
be examined for the purpose of a
determination under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a>.  However, the significance of
a running account lies in the inferences that can be drawn from the facts that
answer the description
of a "running account" rather than the label itself.  A
running account between traders is merely another name for an active account
running from day to day, as opposed to an account where further debits are not
contemplated. . . .  The </i><cite>essential feature of a running account is
that it predicates a continuing relationship of debtor and creditor with an
expectation
that further debits and credits will be recorded</cite><i>.
Ordinarily, a payment, although often matching an earlier debit, is credited
against the balance owing in the account.  Thus, a
running account is
contrasted with an account where the expectation is that the next entry will be
a credit entry that will close
the account by recording the payment of the debt
or by transferring the debt to the Bad or Doubtful Debt A/c.</i>
<P>

<i>	If the record of the dealings of the parties fits the description of a
"running account", that record will usually provide a solid
ground for
concluding that they conducted their dealings on the basis that they had a
continuing business relationship and that goods
or services would be provided
and paid for on the credit terms ordinarily applicable in the creditor's
business.  When that is so,
a</i><cite> court will usually be able to conclude
that the parties mutually assumed that from a business point of view each
particular payment
was connected with the subsequent provision of goods or
services in that account.</cite><i>  Sometimes, however, the transactions
recorded in the account may be so sporadic that a court cannot conclude that
there was the
requisite connection between a payment and the future supply of
goods even though the account was kept "in the ordinary form of a
running
account in which debits and credits are recorded chronologically and in which
payments are not shown as attributable to any
particular deliveries but are
brought generally into credit". . ..  Thus, it is not the label "running
account" but the conclusion
that the payments in the account were connected
with the future supply of goods or services that is relevant, because it is
that
connection which indicates a continuing relationship of debtor and
creditor.  It is this conclusion which makes it necessary to consider
the
ultimate and not the immediate effect of individual payments . . ..  As Barwick
CJ said in Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees .
. .:</i>
<P>

<i>	"In my opinion, it is enough if, on the facts of any case, the court can
feel confident that </i><cite>implicit in the circumstances in which the
payment is made is a mutual assumption by the parties that there will be a
continuance
of the relationship of buyer and seller with resultant continuance
of the relation of debtor and creditor in the running account</cite><i>, so
that, to use the expressions employed in Richardson's Case . . .,  "it is
impossible" - I interpolate, in a business sense -
"to pause at any payment
into the account and treat it as having produced an immediate effect to be
considered independently of what
followed . . .'."</i>

<P>

512	There is I accept, no basis for concluding that any WUP of Cashflow's money
that was made to CODFA was `connected with the future
supply of goods or
services'.  [<i>Air Services Australia v Ferrier</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1996%20185%20CLR%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1996 185 CLR 483</a> at

Burley J said at pages 513-514:
<P>

	<i>`The manner in which this case was argued was based on the assumption by
both parties that the dealings between the parties constituted
a running
account.  Accordingly, in their respective final addresses, counsel addressed
me, first, as to whether or not the impugned
payments constituted a preference
taking into account the provisions of s 588FA(2) and, second, if the impugned
payments otherwise
came within Section 588FA, as to whether or not the defences
available to the defendant under Section 588FG had been made out.  I
am content
to deal with each of those separate contentions individually but subject to a
qualification:  it is clear from the decision
of Wells J in Re Baronga Nominees
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20108%20LSJS%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 108 LSJS 331</a>, (and see also Rothmans Exports Pty Ltd v Mistmorn Pty Ltd

436)</a>, that the two concepts argued separately by counsel for the parties may to
some degree overlap.  For example, the question of whether
or not the impugned
payments or any of them were received in "good faith" may have a bearing upon
the question of whether or not
a running account continued to exist.</i>
<P>

<i>	Wells J, having referred to the concept of "good faith" encompassed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 122(2)(b)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 122(4)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a>, said (at 337),
in relation to the running account defence, "that when Barwick CJ, in the
Queensland Bacon Case [(1966) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=115%20CLR%20266" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">115 CLR 266]</a> at p 286, spoke of `a mutual
assumption by the parties that there will he [sic] a continuance of the
relationship of buyer and seller
with resultant continuance of the relation of
debtor and creditor in the running account' he was asserting, by necessary
implication,
that there would be such a meeting of the minds of the parties as
would support that assumption.  It follows that if the creditor
receives
payment upon an assumption that is other than that described by Barwick CJ the
foundation that might have existed for the
relationship referred to is absent,
and the creditor loses the chance of invoking the running account
principle."</i>
<P>

<i>	In my view the approach taken by Wells J in Baronga Nominees is equally
applicable to the current provisions because the use of the
phrase "continuing
business relationship" in s 588FA(2) and the fact that a running account is
given as an example indicate that
the subsection embraces the concept of a
mutual assumption existing between the debtor and creditor of the same nature
contemplated
by Barwick CJ in the Queensland Bacon Case (supra).</i>
<P>

<i>	It seems to me that receipt of payments other than on the basis of the
"mutual assumption" includes payments which were received
by the creditor other
than in good faith or other than in the ordinary course of business or, to use
a shorthand expression borrowed
(and modified) from the case law, with
bankruptcy in view:  Robertson v Grigg <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1932/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%2047%20CLR%20257" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 47 CLR 257.'</a></i>
<P>

514	I accept Cashflow's submission that Master Burley was correct in holding
that before section 588FA(3) applies, there must be
a `mutual assumption by the
parties that there will be a continuance of the relationship of buyer and
seller with the resultant continuance
of the relationship of buyer and creditor
in the running account.  [I interpolate that in understanding this notion, the
expression
`buyer and seller' would extend to a supplier and an acquirer of
services].  It seems to me that receipt of the payments other than
on the basis
of the `mutual assumption';  includes payments which were received by the
creditor other than in good faith or other
than in the ordinary course of
business or . . . with bankruptcy in view'.
<P>

515	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that in the present case, it is
impossible for there to be the `mutual assumption'
when:
<P>

	(a)	the directing mind of both of the companies involved knew nothing at all
about the WUPs;
<P>

(b)	the payments were not received in good faith (because the only one who knew
about them at all was Walters, who knew that they
were seriously improper),
and
<P>

<i>(</i>c)	it is difficult to imagine payments which were less in the ordinary
course of business.
<P>

	<b>Quantum if the Section 588FA(3) Submission is made out by CODFA</b>
<P>

516	Cashflow submitted that, if contrary to its submissions, the various WUPs
were held to fall within section 588FA(3), it is necessary
(because of section
588FE(3)) to look at how the account has moved during the last six months
before the Relation Back Day.  In light
of the above holding that the WUPs do
not fall within section 588FA(3), it is unnecessary to consider these
alternative arguments.
<P>

	<b>Unfair Preference</b>
<P>

<b>	Is a WUP a Transaction within the Meaning of Section 588FA Corporations
Law?</b>
<P>

517	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that the WUPs are each a
`transaction' within the meaning of section 588FA.
<P>

518	I accept that the WUPs fit within the definition of `transaction' in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> of the Corporations Law because:
<P>

	(i)	They are a `conveyance, transfer or other disposition by the body of the
property of the body', and so fall within (a) of that
definition.
<P>

(ii)	They are a `payment made by the body', and so within (d) of that
definition.
<P>

(iii)	In construing (a) and (d), the expression `by the body' in my view ought
be construed widely, to include the sort of transaction
which occurred here,
where an officer of the body was acting dishonestly and outside the scope of
his authority.
<P>

(iv)	I accept Cashflow's submission that there is no requirement that a
`transaction' be one in which the body is the active party.

519	In support of the proposition that there is no requirement that a
`transaction' be one in which the body is an active party

following factors:
<P>

	(a)	A `transaction' can include elements in which the body does not
participate at all.
<P>

(b)	Insofar as the examples occur in the definition, `Common to the examples is
the characteristic that the conduct or dealing engaged
in by the debtor company
has the consequence of effecting a change in the rights, liabilities or
property of the company itself'.

<P>

(c)	Even if the WUPs do not fit within paragraph (a) or (d), the WUPs, I
accept, still fall within the definition of `transaction'
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9.</a>  In
support of that finding are the following factors:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	The paragraphs in the definition are not exhaustive.  Those
paragraphs are expressly stated to be examples of the actual definition

that it be a `transaction to which the body is a party'<i>.</i>
<P>

but it is an inclusive definition and I accept, is of no assistance.
<P>

	(b)	When Cashflow's money has been paid away by its secretary and accountant,
without authority, that is I accept, a transaction
to which Cashflow is a
party, in the relevant sense.
<P>

	(c)	There is, I accept, no requirement of knowledge, or consent, or voluntary
participation in the notion of being a `party' to
a transaction - a defendant
becomes a party to litigation by being named as such, regardless of whether he
knows about it or consents
to it.
<P>

	(d)	The Macquarie Dictionary (3rd edn) definition of `party' is:
<P>

<i>	`party</i>
<P>

<i>	noun plural parties;</i>
<P>

<i>	1.  a group gathered together for some purpose, as for amusement or
entertainment.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.  a social gathering or entertainment, as of invited guests at a private
house or elsewhere:  to give a party.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.  a detachment of troops assigned to perform some particular
service.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.  (often cap.) a number of body of persons ranged on one side, or united
in purpose or opinion, in opposition to others, as in
politics, etc:  the
Australian Labor Party.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.  the system or practice of taking sides on public questions or the
like.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.  attachment or devotion to a side or faction:  partisanship.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.  a person immediately concerned in some transaction or legal
proceeding.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.  Mining a group of men performing geophysical work of a specific
project, ordinarily using a single method.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.  one who participates in some action or affair.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.  the person under consideration.</i>
<P>

<i>	11.  a person in general, adjective.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.  of or relating to a party or faction:  partisan:  party issue.</i>
<P>

<i>	13.  of or for a social gathering:  a party dress.</i>
<P>

<i>	14.  given to partying:  a party girl.</i>
<P>

<i>	15.  Heraldry divided into parts, usually two parts, as a shield. Verb (i)

<i>	16.  to take part in festivities at or as at a party.  Phrase.</i>

<i>	17.  come to the party to assist, especially with money;  fall in with
one's plans.</i>
<P>

<i>	18.  party on to continue a party.  [ME parti(e), from OF, pp. Of partir
PART, verb]'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>I accept Cashflow's submission that the seventh meaning is the
appropriate one to the present situation.
<P>

	(e)	The etymology of `party' (as stated in the Macquarie dictionary) suggests
that all that is required for A to be `party to'
a transaction, is that A is
part of what happened in that transaction.  If the transaction is the theft of
A's property, A is, I
accept, a party to the transaction, even though not
involved in any deliberate activity in connection with that transaction.
<P>

520	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that there is no basis for
restricting the definition of `transaction' to acts in
the law which the body
enters deliberately.  The list of examples of transaction includes (e), and
`obligation incurred by the company'.
 There is, I accept, nothing to stop the
circumstances which result in the arising of a restitutionary obligation being
an `obligation
incurred'.  Further, as a restitutionary obligation can be
incurred through circumstances (like the present, or like <i>State Bank of NSW
v Swiss Bank Corporation </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2039%20NSWLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 39 NSWLR 350)</a>, where there is no voluntary
action or deliberate action on the part of the entity which incurs the
obligation, there is no reason
to restrict the definition of `transaction' to
transactions which involve action on the part of the company.
<P>

521	I further accept Cashflow's submission that the policy of the preference
provisions is that one creditor of a company ought
not be better off, as the
result of transactions which occur in the six months before the winding up
starts, than that creditor would
be if the transaction had not occurred.  As a
matter of policy, if the secretary of a company disburses the company's money
(outside
the scope of his or her authority) in selectively paying off certain
favoured creditors of the company, and the company goes into
liquidation soon
thereafter, the liquidator, I accept, ought not be in any worse position than
he would be if the same payments had
been made with full authority of the
board.  This policy, I accept, supports the wider meaning of `party'.
<P>

	<b>Is CODFA a Creditor of Cashflow in Relation to each WUP?</b>
<P>

522	At the time of each of the WUPs, CODFA was, I accept, a creditor of
Cashflow, within the meaning of section 588FA(1)(a) and
(b).  It is sufficient
I accept, to be a creditor that someone would have a right of proof in the
winding up of Cashflow, at the
date of receiving the putative preference.  [See
in<i> Re Paine;  Ex parte Read</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%201%20QB%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] 1 QB 122</a> at 124]<i>  </i>It is
sufficient, I accept, for being a creditor (in that sense) that Cashflow has an
obligation to repay CODFA which is based on
restitution.
<P>

523	It is then necessary to examine the course of payments which make up the
WUPs to see whether, in relation to each of them, CODFA
has a right to
restitution.  That matter is dealt with below.
<P>

524	There is no longer any need for a payment to a creditor to be one also made
`in the capacity of creditor'.  [At least some authorities
held this to be a
requirement under previous law - <i>Expo International Pty Ltd (In Liquidation)
v Torma</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%203%20ACLC%20748" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 3 ACLC 748</a>;  <i>Cf Yeomans v Lease Industrial Finance

<P>

525	Rather, the Corporations Law simply requires the payment to be in fact made
to someone who is a creditor, and looks to the effect
of the transaction in
improving the position that that creditor has in a winding up, as the test for
voidness.
<P>

526	It will be recalled that some of the WUP cheques were to, or from, the
Burkett account.  The undisputed evidence, I accept,
is that the Burketts were
acting as agent for CODFA in making their account available.  Hence, payments
to, and from, the Burkett
account are to be viewed as in no different situation
to payments to, and from, CODFA's own account.
<P>

527	Each payment alleged by Cashflow to be an unfair preference, is one which
reduced an amount which was already owing by Cashflow
to CODFA and hence was a
payment made `to a creditor'.  [<i>Re Jaques McAskell Advertising Freeth
Division Pty Ltd</i> <i>(In Liquidation)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NSWLR%20249" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NSWLR 249.</a>
<P>

528	Exhibit GMG4 shows that at all times during the last six months before the
Relation Back Day (that is, all transactions from
and including the payment of
$15,767 on 9 April 1996), payments from Cashflow to CODFA were ones which
reduced a balance owing by
Cashflow to CODFA.  The same result applies if one
does not regard the payment of $20,000 which CODFA made on 2 April 1996 direct
to Trans-pac No. 2, as an amount owing by Cashflow to CODFA.
<P>

	<b>Is Section 588FA(1)(b) Satisfied - Is the result that the Creditor receives
more than the Creditor would Receive by Proving in the
Winding-Up?</b>
<P>

529	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that section 588FA(1)(b) is
satisfied.  The evidence is that there will be substantially
less than a full
return to unsecured creditors of Cashflow.  The latest report as to affairs of
Cashflow in evidence, shows a deficiency
of $1,622,083.  [See Affidavit of Mr
Bonvino of 5 March 1999, page 46]  While an amount has been paid by Westpac in
settlement of
Cashflow's claim against it, that amount is, I accept,
insufficient to make up the deficiency.  An amount of $125,680 (being the
proceeds available from the only one of the Panayi mortgages which was not
discharged) remains in a solicitor's trust account awaiting
the outcome of a
dispute between various of the Panayis, and Cashflow, concerning who is
entitled to it - Mr Thorpe's statement,
4 March 1999.  The maximum possible
return to Cashflow from that source is $125,680 (which would happen if Cashflow
were to win completely
it's dispute with the Panayis, and recover all the legal
costs associated with that dispute, which is presumably an unlikely event).
Even if the maximum return were, however, to be received, there would still be
a deficiency in the Cashflow liquidation.  Liquidator's
fees of in the order of
$227,000 and disbursements in the order of $35,000 remain to be paid.  Legal
fees concerning these proceedings
(totalling $277,208 as at 10 March 1999)
remain to be paid from the assets of the company.  I accept Cashflow's
submission that it
follows that the amount that CODFA received in each of the
transactions alleged to be preferences, was more than CODFA would receive
if
the transaction were set aside and the creditor required to prove in the
winding-up.
<P>

	<b>Insolvency of Cashflow</b>
<P>

530	Under section 513A(e) Corporations Law, the winding-up is taken to have
commenced on the day the winding-up order was made.
 Under the definition of
`Relation Back Day' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> Corporations Law, the Relation Back Day of the
company is the day on which the application for the winding-up order was filed.
That,
in the present situation, was 12 September 1996.
<P>

531	The definition of `insolvent' is to be found in section 95A Corporations
Law.
<P>

532	Under section 588E Corporations Law, Cashflow is presumed, for the purposes
of any recovery proceedings brought by the liquidator,
to continue to be
insolvent during certain periods of time.  `Recovery proceedings' are defined
in section 588E(1).  The present
applications by the Cashflow liquidator are
all `recovery proceedings' because they are (in one alternative way of reading
Cashflow's
case), applications made under section 588FF.
<P>

533	The periods of time during which the presumption of continuance of
insolvency operates are:
<P>

	(a)	continually from the time of any proved insolvency - section 588E(3)
Corporations Law, and
<P>

(b)	continually through the period (not exceeding twelve months prior to the
Relation Back Day) during which there is a failure
to keep proper books and
records in the manner required by section 289(1) Corporations Law - [through
the combined operation of section
599E(3) and (4) Corporations Law].
<P>

534	Evidence before the Court from Mr Cachia, provides evidence of actual
insolvency of Cashflow from November 1995 onwards.  Hence,
Cashflow is presumed
to be continually insolvent from November 1995.
<P>

535	In the alternative and had CODFA been right in its assertion about being
entitled to restitution in connection with the WUPs,
Cashflow can be shown to
be insolvent from August 1995.  [See Judgment paragraph 540 and following]
<P>

536	There was, I accept, a failure to keep proper books and records in the
manner required by section 289 Corporations Law for the
whole of the last
twelve months of Cashflow's existence ending on the Relation Back Day.  Hence,
I accept, that Cashflow is presumed
to be insolvent during the whole of that
period.  That contravention, I accept, is fourfold: 
<P>

	(i)	Cashflow has failed to keep accounting records that correctly record and
explain its transactions for the whole of the period
- section
588E(4)(a)(i).
<P>

(ii)	Cashflow has failed to keep accounting records which correctly record and
explain its financial position for the whole of the
period - section
588E(4)(a)(ii).
<P>

(iii)	For the whole of the twelve months, Cashflow has failed to keep
accounting records in a manner so that sure and fair accounts
of the company
can be prepared from time to time - section 588E(4)(a) final phrase plus
section 289(1)(b)(i).
<P>

(iv)	For the whole of the twelve months, Cashflow has failed to keep its
accounting records in such a manner that it's accounts
can be conveniently and
properly audited in accordance with the Corporations Law - section 588E(4)(a)
final phrase plus section 289(1)(b)(ii).
<P>

537	I accept as made out Cashflow's submission that the falsification of the
books was deliberate, systematic, long term and significant
in amount.
Evidence which supports the failure to keep books and records properly, I
accept, includes the following:
<P>

	(i)	Mr Cachia has given evidence on which he was not cross-examined, that the
books and records were not being kept in the manner
required by the
Corporations Law - Exhibit P8 pages 3-4.
<P>

(ii)	The provisional liquidator's report states that the books and records of
Cashflow were incorrect - Exhibit PX1 pages 1476 and
1479.  The incorrect
entries included ones made in the monthly management accounts - Exhibit PX1
page 1478.
<P>

(iii)	The accounts as at 30 June 1995 were falsified by the inclusion of the
`dummy' entry for $140,000.  The journal entry which
Mr Gelder inferred, from
the ledger accounts, is one which would increase the apparent cash at bank by
$140,000, and decrease the
Trans-pac debt by $140,000 - Transcript page 120.
<P>

	There was also another false entry or entries which Mr Gelder could not
identify - transcript page 121.  The comparison between
what the accounts
showed as cash at bank, and the actual cash at bank on 30 June [transcript
pages 121-122], demonstrated that there
must have been another entry in the
accounts.  Mr Gelder did not know whether the $140,000 entry had affected the
profit and loss
for the year or not - transcript page 124.
<P>

(iv)	On occasions (semble in the period after January 1995), if the total of
invoices listed by Trans-pac was insufficient to support
amounts that Walters
had paid to Trans-pac, he is shown to have recorded fictitious invoices in the
accounting records - see the
report by Mr Gelder of 9 September 1998 pages 5
and 12;  transcript 64.  One place where he recorded the fictitious invoices
was
in Trans-pac's debtor ledger which Cashflow maintained - transcript page
66.
<P>

(v)	The false entries made their way through to the monthly profit and loss
accounts, each month where there were false entries
- transcript page 66.
<P>

(vi)	Mr Walters created not only false invoices, but also false credit notes
and receipts in the accounting records of Cashflow
- see report of Mr Gelder of
9 September 1998 page 16.
<P>

(vii)	Overpayments to Trans-pac arose over time, and were not properly
disclosed in the accounting records of Cashflow - see the
report of Mr Gelder
of 9 September 1998 page 16.  The overpayments occurred in the months of
January, March, April, May and every
month from July to December in 1995, and
in January, February, March and June of 1996 - see Mr Gelder's report of 9
September 1998
page 21 column 14.  It follows that in each of those months, the
records are shown to have been falsified.
<P>

(viii)	Mr Walters may also have made some false entries on First Schedules -
transcript page 64.
<P>

(ix)	Many of the First Schedules were missing - transcript page 64.
<P>

(x)	There were not enough debtors enquiry lists to match up with every amount
that had been paid by Mr Walters as purported factoring
- transcript page
65.
<P>

(xi)	Cheques were written on the Cashflow bank account from 9 September 1995
which showed as the payee someone other than the person
to whom the cheque was
really paid - listed in annexure to report of Mr Gelder of 4 June 1998 at dates
9 September 1995, 6 December
1995, 7 December 1995, 5 January 1996, 7 February
1996, 10 May 1996, 15 May 1996 and 31 May 1996.
<P>

(xii)	Cheque no. 400212 dated 10 May 1996 for $20,000 was noted in Cashflow's
books as payable to Trans-pac.  In fact it was paid
into the Burkett account -
see Mr Gelder's 9 September 1998 report page 17.
<P>

(xiii)	Mr Gelder agreed that, as an auditor, he could not give Cashflow a clear
certificate - transcript page 68.
<P>

(xiv)	In each of the months of March, April and May 1995 and in each month from
July 1995 to March 1996 (inclusive), there was an
overpayment to Trans-pac -
see Exhibit D1H page 21 (schedule page 1) column 14.  Whenever there was an
overpayment, this was one
of the occasions when Mr Walters made false
accounting entries - transcript page 89.  Hence, those months can positively be
identified
as ones where a false entry was made.  Given that the records
include accounts which continue from month to month, those false entries
would
affect the accounts in all months after March 1995.
<P>

(xv)	In particular, the recording of false invoices would mean that the company
records show the company as receiving fee income
(from the discounting of those
false invoices which it did not receive - transcript 106-107).  This would have
happened from at least
March 995 onwards.
<P>

(xvi)	There is, I accept, an unexplained mystery about there being two
different versions of the profit and loss account for June
1996 - transcript
page 103-104.
<P>

538	None of the contraventions of section 289 is one which falls within an
exception in section 588E, and this for the following
reasons:
<P>

	(i)	The contravention of section 289 is not one which is only minor or
technical.  Hence the exception in section 588E(5) does
not apply.
<P>

(ii)	the contravention of section 289 is not one which arises from someone
destroying, concealing or removing accounting records
of the company.  Rather,
the contravention arose from Mr Walters' deliberately making false entries in
the accounting records of
the company.  Hence the exception in section 588E(6)
does not apply.
<P>

(iii)	The recovery proceedings in this litigation are, I accept, all
applications under section 588FF.  However, another party to
each transaction
(each Walters Unauthorised Payment) was CODFA.  CODFA is, I accept, a related
entity of Cashflow.  The definition
of `related entity' is in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a>
Corporations Law.  CODFA is a body corporate, one of whose directors (Mr
Wright) is also a director of Cashflow.  Hence, CODFA falls
into paragraph (k)
of the definition of `related entity'.  Hence the exception in section 588E(7)
does not apply.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Has CODFA Rebutted the Presumption of Insolvency</b>
<P>

539	When there is a presumption of insolvency, the onus is plainly on CODFA to
rebut that presumption.
<P>

540	There was in my view, ample evidence to support a conclusion of insolvency
of Cashflow throughout the twelve months before the
Relation Back Date.  All
this evidence supporting insolvency would require to be explained away for
CODFA to be able to rebut the
presumption of insolvency.  Evidence which
Cashflow put forward as supporting the conclusion of insolvency and which, in
my view
does support that conclusion, is as follows:
<P>

	(i)	Mr Cachia expressed the view that the company was insolvent over the whole
of the period in relation to which the liquidator
seeks to set aside the
transactions, and he was not cross-examined on this.
<P>

(ii)	The company had practically no assets apart from any debts that it had
factored.  - The balance sheet as at 30 June 1995 showed
assets consisting of
$25,446 cash, $1,613,998 receivables and $950 intangibles - Mr Bonvino
affidavit of 27 April 1998, page 154.
 This, I accept, is an imprudent way of
running a factoring company.  A factoring business, I accept, is the type of
business that
needs to have access quickly to large sums, to be able to carry
on - transcript page 94.  It means that the company does not have
assets
against which money can readily be borrowed if it needs to raise money.
<P>

(iii)	The effect of Mr Walters dispensing with the procedures laid down by the
factoring deed since 7 December 1994, was I accept,
that there was no effective
assignment of any debts from Trans-pac No. 1 from that date.
<P>

(iv)	When Cashflow's money started to be paid to Trans-pac No. 2 there was no
assignment of debts by Trans-pac No. 2.
<P>

(v)	The company had no arrangements with any banker to provide overdraft
accommodation if it were to be needed.
<P>

(vi)	The debts that were owed to Cashflow by Trans-pac No. 1 and the obligation
of Trans-pac No. 2 to make restitution for the money
of Cashflow it had
received, were worthless (or alternatively worth far less than their face
value).  The liquidation of Trans-pac
No. 1 has concluded, with a nil return to
creditors and the debtors of $1.2million charged to Cashflow were said to be
worthless.
<P>

(vii)	The interest which Cashflow was to pay to Pyrafount and to other lenders
was payable monthly - Mr Bonvino's affidavit at page
87.  The amount of
interest per month ranged (over the year ended 30 June 1996) from $23,827 per
month [September 1995] to $33,059
per month [June 1996].
<P>

(viii)	The fees that were payable to Walters &amp; Associates and to Factors
were payable monthly.  So was the office services fee
payable to CODFA.
<P>

(ix)	From September/October 1995 the monthly meetings of Cashflow were being
held later and later.  It was at the monthly meetings
that the cheques were
signed for the interest, and the fees.  The effect of the meetings being held
late was that those expenses
of Cashflow were not being paid when they fell
due.
<P>

(x)	The flow of funds through Cashflow that is shown in the Schedule to Mr
Gelder's first report - Exhibit D1G - is one which occurred
in the context that
the interest and fees owed by Cashflow were being paid late.  In that context,
on every day save one when Cashflow
money was used to repay WUPs, Cashflow did
not have sufficient money in the bank to be able to repay the amount that had
been `borrowed'
from CODFA by means of the WUPs - Transcript page 79 and
following.  This is, I accept, strong evidence of insolvency.  I infer that
Mr
Walters would have repaid the WUPs if he thought that Cashflow would be able to
continue without them - he had of course `borrowed',
then `repaid', on three
separate occasions before 17 August 1995.  Further, that a sum of money appears
as a credit in the bank account
of Cashflow at the start of a day does not, I
accept, mean that it is cleared funds that can be drawn against - a deposit is
usually
only available to be drawn against only a few days after it is
deposited - Transcript page 83.  The only occasion when there was
a partial
repayment of the WUPs when Cashflow had enough money in the bank, at the start
of the day when repayment was made, to be
able to repay the WUPs is, on the
evidence, 7 February 1996 - Exhibit D1G pages 11-21.  The only reason why
Cashflow had money in
the bank in February is that Pyrafount made an additional
advance of $200,000 to Cashflow on 1 February 1996.  Other lenders also
lent a
further $150,000 on 1 February 1996.  Given that the interest and other
payments were being made late, and that Mr Walters'
view of the needs of
Cashflow was that he did not see his way clear to repay all the WUPs, that I
accept, does not amount to positive
proof that Cashflow was solvent on 7
February 1996.  Cashflow was effectively trying to operate without working
capital.  Trans-pac
was also insolvent.  Hence, debts owed by Trans-pac were, I
accept, irrecoverable.
<P>

(xi)	From Mr Bonvino's first involvement with Cashflow, he was told `in order
for Cashflow Finance Pty Limited to meet its factoring
commitments on time, we
will require funds to be banked to our bank account a day or so before
required'.  The company operated so
that it had few liquid funds.  This I
accept, is also evidence that there was no special arrangement with the bank
permitting the
company to draw against uncleared funds.
<P>

541	I have earlier in the Judgment set out the fact that the reconstruction of
the account of Trans-pac which Mr Bonvino carried
out (after deleting the
various entries which Mr Walters had told him were false) showed
understatements in the monthly statements
of the total amount outstanding on
the Trans-pac account of particular amounts - see paragraph 358(xi).
<P>

542	Hence, when the debt in the Trans-pac account was worthless, this
understatement of the true extent of the indebtedness had
the effect of
reducing the net assets of Cashflow by the same amount, below what the records
at the time would suggest.
<P>

543	Cashflow relies upon the following matters, each of which seems to me to be
of substance and is made out:
<P>

	(a)	The accounts of Cashflow at 30 June 1995 showed it as having an operating
profit after tax of $105,430.  At the time of drawing
those accounts, the
obligation to pay the tax was a real one (in that the reasonable expectation
was that an assessment would issue
for the income tax expense of $51,930 and
would need to be paid).  It is now, I accept, known that the taxable income was
overstated,
in the accounts, by at least the amount of the Trans-pac fees that
had been shown as accrued due, and possibly by the $140,000 adjustment
that
Walters made.  The conclusion from the accounts is, I accept, that Cashflow may
well have made a loss of the order of $35,000
or more in the year ended 30 June
1995.
<P>

(b)	Whether or not the payment of $140,000 affected the profitability of
Cashflow in the year ended 30 June 1995, I accept that
it affected its
liquidity.  Mr Walters has admitted to Mr Star that `somewhere in the
April/May/June period (of 1995), he advanced
$140,000 or thereabouts too much
to Trans-pac - Exhibit PX 1 page 575.  Mr Walters' other admissions about the
amounts of unauthorised
advances after 30 June 1995 I accept, understate the
position.
<P>

(c)	The tax was actually paid in December 1995.  The whole of the amount that
was shown as operating profit in the accounts ($105,430)
was distributed as a
dividend, in February 1996.  From that time onwards, those amounts were not
available to fund the debts of the
company.
<P>

(d)	After liquidation, Cashflow submitted an amended tax return for the year
ended 30 June 1995 and in November 1996 obtained a
refund of the tax it had
paid, plus some interest.  [Exhibit PX1 page 1571]  However, in the period from
December 1995 to liquidation,
the amount that had been wrongly paid for tax,
reduced the liquid assets of Cashflow.
<P>

(e)	The balance sheet of Cashflow as at 30 June 1995 includes (as by far the
most significant asset) receivables of $1,613,998.
 [Affidavit of Mr Bonvino,
27 April 1998 page 154].  These receivables would include debts owing to
Trans-pac No. 1 and Trans-pac
No. 2 which had been taken up in the accounts of
Cashflow.  There is, I accept, no allowance for bad debts.  The amount of the
receivables
as at 30 June 1995 is overstated by $224,706 [Mr Cachia Annexure
`A', first column] on the basis on which Mr Cachia did his calculations
(namely, accepting that a debt which appears in the books of Cashflow as owing
from a Trans-pac customer is really owing and calculating
the difference
between the amount of debt of Trans-pac to Cashflow that appears in the
accounts and the amount that the reconstruction
of the Trans-pac account -
Annexure `B' to Mr Cachia - shows as owing.  That basis is, I accept, too
generous to Cashflow's solvency,
in that it does not take account of the fact
that many of the debts owing to Trans-pac taken up in the accounts of Cashflow
had not
really been assigned.  Nor I accept does it make any allowance for bad
debts.
<P>

(f)	On the strength of the accounts as at 30 June 1995, Cashflow paid dividends
totalling $105,430 [- Affidavit of Mr Bonvino, 27
April 1998 paragraph 17(e)
and (f).]  The dividend was paid even though accounts had certainly overstated
the profit of the company,
and possibly overstated the profit (and the
available funds) by at least $140,000.  This I accept, worsened the insolvency
of the
company.
<P>

(g)	Any profit that had been made in the year to 30 June 1995 was not available
in cash to meet the debts of the company as they
fell due, but rather had been
reinvested in the business - Transcript page 49.
<P>

(h)	The amount of the total of the WUPs that was outstanding at one time,
represents the extent to which Cashflow could not pay
its debts as they fell
due from its own money.  I accept Cashflow's submission that it is difficult to
see what could be more indicative
of an inability to pay debts as they fall
due, than that Mr Walters needed to make unauthorised `borrowings' of money
from CODFA.
 Exhibit GMG4 appended to this Judgment shows that there were
substantial unauthorised takings of the money of CODFA to make up for
the cash
deficiency of Cashflow, continually from August 1995.
<P>

(i)	I accept that it was because Cashflow was insolvent that Mr Walters needed
to engage in the complicated subterfuges that were
involved in the WUPs.
<P>

(j)	On some occasions, cheques that Mr Walters and Mr Wright wrote out to
Trans-pac, were deposited back into the bank account of
Cashflow, so that it
looked as though Cashflow was receiving deposits [- Affidavit of Mr Bonvino, 27
April 1998 para 29(b).]  That
is, I accept, another litmus test for
insolvency.
<P>

(k)	Not only did Cashflow not make a profit of $157,000 in the year ended 30
June 1995, it is shown to have made a loss.  After
Cashflow went into
liquidation, an amended income tax return, disclosing a loss, was accepted by
the Commissioner, and a refund made
of the tax that had been paid [- PX
1571-1573.]
<P>

(l)	Trans-pac No. 1 was a substantial debtor of Cashflow.  Over the period from
February 1995, the debt which Trans-pac owed to
Cashflow fluctuated within the
range of 50-60% of the total indebtedness owed to Cashflow - Mr Bonvino's
affidavit of 14 March 1999,
Annexure `B'.  Trans-pac No. 1 was itself a company
which I accept was insolvent during the time from February 1995.  In this
regard
I accept the following matters put forward by Cashflow as proven:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	Trans-pac No. 1 was incorporated on 30 December 1993 and stopped
trading in November 1995.  It went into liquidation with a deficiency
of
$2,644,487.  If that loss was incurred evenly over the 23 months it was
trading, that was a loss of nearly $115,000 per month.
<P>

(ii)	Trans-pac No. 1's annual return for the financial year ended 30 June 1994,
showed it at that time as having negative shareholders
equity of $12,695 -
Exhibit P5.  Trans-pac No. 1's annual return for the year ended 30 June 1995
showed it as having negative shareholders
equity at that time of $1,117,870 -
Exhibit P5.
<P>

(iii)	Trans-pac No. 1 had itself had significant losses arising from the
paymistress taking company funds.  An amount of $30-40,000
was identified as
money that the pay mistress had taken, `but there was a lot more money going
that they haven't disclosed.  It could
have been $3-400,000' - Exhibit PX1 page
1530.  As a result of this, Mr Peter Panayi told Mr Star that Trans-pac (at
some stage in
mid to late 1995) was insolvent - Exhibit PX1 page 1530.
<P>

(iv)	The Panayis took over the business of Trans-pac No. 1 on an assurance from
Barnes that it was viable, `and Peter (Panayi] subsequently
found out it was
quite the opposite' - Exhibit PX1 page 1531.
<P>

(v)	It's statement of affairs shows it as going into liquidation owing
$1.2million to Cashflow, secured by a charge over debts,
but the debts are
shown as worthless.  There were $148,000 of preferential creditors (namely the
ATO, for superannuation for employees).
 The unsecured creditors included
$318,000 of unpaid payroll tax, $703,000 of unpaid group tax, nearly $96,000 in
unpaid PPS tax,
various insurers, Mobil and the local council.  I accept that
these are the sort of debts which cannot be run up in a short time.
 I accept
that they support the conclusion that Trans-pac was itself insolvent many
months before November 1995.
<P>

(vi)	When Trans-pac was such an important debtor of Cashflow, this I accept,
makes Cashflow insolvent.
<P>

(vii)	Further, the trade debts that Trans-pac had, and purported to assign to
Cashflow, were themselves I accept, not good debts.
 A high proportion of the
debts purportedly assigned to Cashflow were more than 90 days old - Report of
Mr Gelder, 9 September 1998
page 23.
<P>

(viii)	The bank account of Trans-pac No. 1 was in overdraft, at various times
from at least July 1995 until the account was closed
- PX1 28 - 33, 556.  (When
it was closed, the debit balance was brought to zero by a cheque drawn on
Trans-pac No. 2.)
<P>

544	Trans-pac also owed amounts to Cashflow for fees.  The sources of income of
Cashflow, according to its management accounts,
were nearly all fees.  A high
proportion of the fees that were owed to Cashflow were owed by Trans-pac.
While they accrued due and
appear in the monthly management accounts, they are
not money that can be relied on to actually pay Cashflow's debts.  If they are
deducted from the monthly profit that appears in Cashflow's monthly management
accounts, Cashflow is seen to make a loss every month
from June 1995
onwards.
<P>

545	Trans-pac No. 2 as has already been made plain, is also in liquidation.  It
changed its name to Kemps Creek Distributors Pty
Limited on 27 April 1998.  A
liquidator had been appointed on 3 August 1998.  It has a deficiency of
$1.926million.  The priority
claims by employees are $241,948.  The Australian
Tax Office is an unsecured creditor for $691,937 out of claims of $1,022,666 by
unsecured creditors.  Its only assets are the subject of a charge to the Panayi
family.  I accept Cashflow's submission that the
likely conclusion is that
Cashflow could never attribute any value, as money available to pay its debts,
to its legal right to restitution
of the money Mr Walters had paid to Trans-pac
No. 2.
<P>

546	The above matters demonstrate, it seems to me, that Cashflow was insolvent,
quite apart from any consideration of whether there
was or was not a liability
on it to repay the Pyrafount loan.  However, the Pyrafount loan ought also, I
accept, be regarded as a
current liability due to be repaid.  In this regard, I
accept the following matters put forward by Cashflow as made out:
<P>

	(i)	Mr Gelder relied on a minute of a supposed directors' meeting in April
1994 as setting out the terms of repayment of the Pyrafount
loan.  That minute
is one that Mr Bonvino did not sign.  [See Mr Bonvino's evidence of 22 March
1999].  It attributes the directors'
meeting to a time before Mr Bonvino first
saw the advertisement in the Herald which first brought him into contact with
Mr Wright.
 The minute, I find, is a fabrication.
<P>

(ii)	The uncontradicted evidence about the terms on which funds could be
withdrawn is that funds could be withdrawn on three months
notice even if a
replacement investor could not be found - Mr Bonvino, 14 March 1999, paragraph
2.  Further, Mr Wright and Mr Bonvino
agreed that if ever there was a problem,
Mr Bonvino had the capacity (through his 51% shareholding) to take control of
the company,
and receive the money even quicker than in three months, being
able to withdraw the money when he chose to do so - Mr Bonvino, statement
14
March 1999, paragraph 3.
<P>

(iii)	The `very rough draft of the minute for our agreement' [- Mr Bonvino
statement 27 April 1998 page 86] states:  `Conditions
of loan fund withdrawal
(replacement investor/funds prior to withdrawal)' [- Mr Bonvino statement 27
April 1998 page 87.]  That I
accept, means no more than that the topic of the
conditions of loan fund withdrawal needed to be addressed, concerning both the
circumstances
in which a replacement investor would be found, and concerning
when the funds are withdrawn from being used in the factoring business
before
being returned to the lender.
<P>

(iv)	The inclusion of the loan funds as a current liability, in the balance
sheet of the company as at 30 June 1995 (which Mr Wright
had signed) supports
Mr Bonvino's evidence.
<P>

(v)	I accept that whilst it is correct that no demand had actually been made
for the loan funds to be withdrawn, if Mr Bonvino had
known the truth about how
the company was being run it is inevitable that he would have withdrawn the
funds no later than 30 June
1995.  As the funds would have been withdrawn if Mr
Bonvino had known the truth, I accept that they should be regarded as funds
which
need to be provided for, when considering whether the company is able to
pay its debts as they fall due.
<P>

(vi)	There were two small investors (Jay and Milner), who lent money direct to
Cashflow.  They appear to have been introduced by
Mr Bonvino and to have acted
on his advice.  Their loans are in the same position as the Pyrafount loans.
<P>

547	I accept Cashflow's submission that Mr Gelder's report does not establish
solvency.  I accept that Mr Gelder's solvency statement
was built on the
precarious foundation of the accounts that Mr Walters had prepared, which have
been shown to be works of creative
fiction.  One indication of the extent to
which they are works of fiction can be obtained from comparing the amount of
Trans-pac
debt which Mr Walters asserted in the statements, with the amount of
the Trans-pac debt which Mr Gelder stated really applied - that
is by comparing
lines 11 and 12 of Mr Gelder's solvency statement.  The significance of Mr
Gelder using the Walters' accounts to
come to a conclusion of solvency is quite
different, I accept, to the effect of Mr Cachia using those same accounts as a
starting
point to come to a conclusion of insolvency.  Mr Cachia is able to say
`I know that Mr Walters was showing a better position than
really existed with
these accounts, but by making a few sensible adjustments to them, I can show
that the company is really insolvent'.
 I accept Cashflow's submission that it
is a vastly different exercise to use the accounts as Mr Gelder has sought to
do to base
a conclusion of solvency.
<P>

548	The profit in the first line of Mr Gelder's solvency statement cannot, I
accept, be accepted, as funds available for payment
of debts, in the month in
which the profit is shown by the management accounts to arise, because:
<P>

	(a)	It is based on accounts prepared on an accrual basis.  Fee income which
accrues due in a particular month will not necessarily
ever be received - it
depends on the solvency of the client which is charged the fees - Transcript
page 108.
<P>

(b)	Even if the fee income is ultimately received, it will not be likely to be
available for the payment of debts in the month in
which it accrues -
Transcript page 107.
<P>

(c)	the fee income is overstated in the management accounts, because of Mr
Walters having entered false invoices into the accounting
system - Transcript
page 107.
<P>

549	The exercise of adding on positive amounts in line 4 for the year ended
June 1995 and the amounts of July, August, October and
November 1995, is, as Mr
Gelder admitted, in error - Transcript pages 125-126.  I accept Cashflow's
submission that those amounts
should be zero (if the calculation in lines 11-14
is correct.  If, as a result of the alteration of the calculation in lines
11-14,
the figure in line 14 becomes a negative, that negative should be
transferred up to line 4).
<P>

550	The calculation in lines 11-14 is, I accept, incorrect.  In this regard I
accept the following submissions of Cashflow as made
out:
<P>

	(a)	It contains the admitted error which was corrected in the amended solvency
statement - Exhibit P15.  Correction of that error
causes the adjusted
profit/loss always to be a lower figure - Transcript page 113.
<P>

(b)	It understates the amount of the Trans-pac actual debt by the various
figures identified by Mr Bonvino in Exhibit P3.  I accept
Cashflow's submission
that when Mr Bonvino was not cross-examined concerning Exhibit P3, it must be
accepted as correct.  The effect
is that all the figures in line 12 should
increase by (at minimum) $141,000, the effect of making that correction alone
being to
move the figures in line 14 for the months of August, October and
November 1995 into negatives.
<P>

(c)	The statement of recoverable debtors in line 13 I accept, overstates the
amount of debtors that can be relied on for solvency
purposes.  Mr Gelder
treated a debtor as `recoverable' if there is a legal right to recover it,
regardless of whether there is a
practical likelihood that the debt will be
recovered - Transcript pages 104 and 118.  I accept that this is inadequate -
Transcript
page 105.  Many of the Trans-pac debtors were more than sixty days,
and many more than ninety days - [the actual amounts each month
are stated in
Mr Gelder's second report page 23, otherwise numbered as page 3 of the Schedule
to that report].  Trans-pac ultimately
went into liquidation having debts of
$1.2million charged to Cashflow which debts were worthless.  If only the
90-plus day debtors
are disregarded for solvency purposes, the combined effect
of this and the $141,000 adjustment in line 12, is I accept, to have a
negative
figure in each column of line 5.
<P>

551	I accept Cashflow's submission that it is incorrect to treat the value of
the mortgages given by the Panayis as money available
for the purposes of
calculating solvency.  This is for the following reasons:
<P>

	(a)	The $600,000 figure attributed to them has no firm foundation.
<P>

(b)	The mortgages secure amounts due under the guarantee.  There is, I accept,
good reason to believe that the guarantees secure
nothing, and hence that the
mortgages secure nothing.
<P>

(c)	I accept that even if the mortgages did secure some substantial sum of
money, they could not be enforced fast enough for the
proceeds ultimately
available from the mortgages to be a sum that should be taken into account in
calculating whether or not Cashflow
had enough liquid funds to be able to meet
its debts as they fell due.
<P>

552	Cashflow submitted that CODFA faces a dilemma in the proceedings concerning
what it should say is the legal effect of the WUPs.
 The submission was that if
CODFA was correct in saying that it had a right to restitution in relation to
the WUPs, that provided
a clear demonstration that Cashflow was insolvent.
<P>

553	Cashflow's detailed submission in this regard was as follows:
<P>

	<i>'18.11.16.1.  If CODFA is right in saying that it has a right to
restitution in relation to the WUPs, that right of restitution is
one which
came into existence immediately the payment of any sum of CODFA's money was
made.  If CODFA's assertion is accepted, then
at any time Cashflow had an
obligation to make immediate repayment to CODFA of the net balance of the
"account" of  the WUPs.  [Baker
v Courage &amp; Co Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1910%5d%201%20KB%2056" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1910] 1 KB 56</a> at 65 per
Hamilton J. Halsbury's Laws of Australia para 370-6270.  There are some
decisions dating from before the time when restitution
was properly understood,
which suggest that a demand is necessary.  However, those decisions are wrong
in principle - see Oughton,
Lowry &amp; Merkin, Limitation of Actions (Lloyds
Commercial law Library (1998) page 225-226;  Mason &amp; Carter Restitution Law
in Australia para 422.2720-2722.]  Those net balances are shown in the
annotated version of GMG4.</i>
<P>

<i>	18.11.16.2.  The monthly management accounts of Cashflow are unreliable in
many respects, but it can safely be inferred that they
do not overstate the
profitability of Cashflow from time to time.  The monthly accounts do not take
up, as a liability of Cashflow,
any obligation it has to make restitution of
the WUPs.  If one adjusts them to take up that liability, the following picture
emerges:</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>
 [ IMAGE ] </i>
<P>

<i>Thus, if CODFA is right in saying that it is entitled to restitution in
relation to the WUPs, Cashflow is insolvent continually from
August
1995.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

554	At the end of the day, to my mind the positive evidence in favour of
Cashflow's insolvency resulted in CODFA being unable to
rebut the presumption
of insolvency.
<P>

555	I turn then to examining whether the unfair preferences are insolvent
transactions:
<P>

	<b>Are the Unfair Preferences Insolvent Transactions</b>
<P>

556	Paragraph 5(c) of CODFA's defence raises an issue that CODFA `does not
admit that transactions were entered into between CODFA
and Cashflow within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p5.7b" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7B</a> Corporations Law'.  I accept Cashflow's submission that
this raises a false issue.
<P>

557	There is no requirement that a transaction be `entered into' before it can
be set aside as a preference.  Section 588FA(1) contemplates
that a transaction
can be an unfair preference if it is `entered into', or if it is `given effect
to', or if it is `required to be
given effect to'.  The context which section
588FA so contemplates, is one which regards these activities relating to a
transaction
as being only three examples of possible activities that there can
be in connection with a transaction.  It is, I accept, quite consistent
with
section 588FA(1) that a transaction simply `occur', whether or not it is
`entered into'.
<P>

558	Section 588FC contemplates that a transaction could be an insolvent
transaction if the company is insolvent `when the transaction
is entered into'.
I accept that clearly that route to being an insolvent transaction requires the
transaction to be `entered into'.
 However, one alternative way in which
section 588FC says the transaction could be an insolvent transaction is if the
company is
insolvent when `an act is done, or an omission is made, for the
purpose of giving effect to the transaction'.  Another alternative
way in which
section 588FC says that a transaction could be an insolvent transaction, is if
the company becomes insolvent because
of, or because of matters including, a
person doing an act, or making an omission, for the purpose of giving effect to
the transaction.
 I accept that neither of those routes require the transaction
to be `entered into'.
<P>

	<b>Were the Unfair Preference Transactions `Entered Into' within the meaning
of Section 588FC?</b>
<P>

559	Each of the unfair preference transactions (the WUPs) was `entered into'
within the meaning of section 588FC.  The expression
`was entered into' is, I
accept, in the passive voice.  It does not say who it is that is required to
have done any act, for the
transaction to `be entered into'.  That the payments
were in fact made, as a result of Mr Walters acting without authority, is I
accept, enough for them to be `entered into'.  It does not matter, I accept,
that Mr Walters was not acting on behalf of Cashflow
when he passed the money
back and forth.
<P>

560	In my view, at the time that each of the transactions was `entered into',
Cashflow was insolvent.  Hence, each of the WUPs is
an insolvent transaction
within section 588FC(a)(i).
<P>

561	Cashflow became insolvent because of (or because of matters including) the
entering into of each of the WUPs.  Hence each of
the WUPs is an insolvent
transaction, within section 588FC(b)(i).)
<P>

	<b>Whether, even if the Transactions were not `Entered Into', they were still
`Insolvent Transactions'</b>
<P>

562	At the time that Mr Walters caused each of the cheques pursuant to which
the WUPs were made to be drawn on Cashflow's bank account,
and paid to CODFA
(or Burkett), and banked into the account of CODFA (or Burkett), an act was
done (by Mr Walters) for the purpose
of giving effect to the transactions.  I
accept that at each of those times, Cashflow was insolvent.  I accept that this
establishes
each of them as an insolvent transaction within section
588FC(a)(ii).
<P>

563	Cashflow became insolvent because of (or because of matters including) a
person (Mr Walters) doing an act for the purpose of
giving effect to the
transaction.  I accept that at each time Walters did such an act, Cashflow was
insolvent.  I accept that this
establishes each of the WUPs as an insolvent
transaction within section 588FC(b)(ii).
<P>

564	Cashflow then submits that the appropriate order is that the transactions
be avoided and that CODFA pay to Cashflow an amount
equal to the amount that
Cashflow paid to CODFA under the transaction.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Defence under Section 588FG(2)</b>
<P>

565	I accept as correct Cashflow's submissions that this defence does not apply
to any `transaction' sought to be avoided.  I accept
that each such transaction
is one in which Cashflow's money was paid to CODFA.  I accept Cashflow's
submission that the defence does
not apply because:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	CODFA did not become a party to the transaction in good faith.  The
relevant directing mind of CODFA became party to the transaction
without
knowing it was party to the transaction at all.  Hence, I accept that section
588FG(2)(a) is not satisfied.
<P>

(ii)	At the time when CODFA became party to the transaction, a reasonable
person in CODFA's circumstances would have had reasonable
grounds for
suspecting that Cashflow was insolvent at the time or would become insolvent as
mentioned in section 588FC(b).  A reasonable
person in CODFA's situation would
realise that the money was a repayment of an unauthorised borrowing which
Walters had engaged in
to prop Cashflow up.  Hence section 588FG(2)(b)(ii) I
accept is not satisfied.
<P>

(iii)	Section 588FG(2)(c) I accept is not satisfied for the following
reasons:
<P>

	(a)	CODFA has not provided valuable consideration under the transaction:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i).  CODFA has not provided valuable consideration at all.  The notion
of `valuable consideration' is, I accept, the language of
contract.  Here,
there was no contract at all between CODFA and Cashflow relating to the
WUPs.
<P>

	(ii).  I accept that CODFA has not provided valuable consideration `under the
transaction'.  The transaction is the repayment of
the unauthorised borrowing.
That is not, I accept, the type of transaction `under' which any consideration
is provided at all.
<P>

	(iii).  Section 95(2) of the <i>Bankruptcy Act</i> 1924 used to provide that
nothing in section 95 (the preference section in that Act) shall affect `. . .
the rights of a . . . payee
. . . in good faith and for valuable consideration
and in the ordinary course of business'.  In relation to section 95(2), when a
loan was repaid, the past consideration consisting of the making of the loan
was sufficient to provide the `valuable consideration'
- <i>Taylor v White</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20110%20CLR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 110 CLR 129</a> at 139.  However, the previous law does not apply here
because here there is no contractual loan, and also the new statutory
requirement
that the consideration be provided under the transaction, I accept,
distinguishes the present section from the old section 92.
<P>

	(b)	Further, I accept that CODFA has not altered its position in reliance on
the transaction.  I accept that rather CODFA did not
know about the transaction
at all.  Hence, I accept that section 588FG(2)(c) is not satisfied.
<P>

(c)	As well as relying on the literal words of section 588FG(2), Cashflow
sought to rely on the purpose of the provisions.  I accept
Cashflow's
submission that the purpose of the provision is to protect ordinary commercial
transactions from being avoided.  I accept
that the transactions that Cashflow
attacks as preferences or uncommercial transactions are shown to have been very
far indeed from
ordinary commercial transactions.  Hence I accept that it was
not within the scope of the mischief to protect these types of uncommercial
transactions.
<P>

	<b>Discretion of the Court to make no Order?</b>
<P>

566	CODFA pleaded that CODFA had not been unjustly enriched by the receipt of
any of the WUPs and that accordingly, it would be
unconscionable for CODFA to
be required to pay any money (either under section 588FF, or at all).
<P>

567	I accept Cashflow's submission that the pleading is legally irrelevant.  I
accept Cashflow's submission that there is no role
for general law notions of
unconscionability here.  The right to set aside the transaction is plainly a
statutory one - see section
588FE.  The consequences of a transaction being set
aside are well established in the law.  Under the law which applied before the
commencement of Part 5.7B, there was no express conferral of a right of
recovery of a preferential payment - the right to recover
it arose as a matter
of law.
<P>

<i>	[Star v O'Brien</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20695" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 695</a> at 702 - 703 recounting the
argument of counsel at 705B-D]
<P>

568	The consequences include that any person who has received money under the
transaction which is avoided must repay it.  I accept
Cashflow's submission
that there is no room for the Court to assert that it has a superior sense of
justice to that which Parliament
has enacted - see <i>Commonwealth of Australia
v SCI Operations Pty Ltd</i> (1998) 72 ALRJ 687.
<P>

569	Cashflow submitted and I accept that the presence of the word `may' in
section 588FF does not mean that there is a discretion
in the Court concerning
whether to make an order in the circumstances of the present case.  In this
regard, I accept the following
propositions which were put forward by way of
Cashflow in its submissions as correct:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	Section 588FF more naturally reads as conferring a jurisdiction on
the Court, rather than stating that there is a discretion in
the Court.
<P>

(ii)	The jurisdiction that is conferred by section 588FF(1) is to make `one or
more of the following orders'.  There is, I accept,
clearly a choice to be made
by the Court as to which of the orders, in the list set out in paragraphs (a)
to (j) of section 588FF(1),
is appropriate to be made.  That does not mean
that, once the Court is satisfied that the circumstances exist which make it
appropriate
for a preference or uncommercial transaction to be set aside, there
is then some separate discretion which the Court can exercise
on `palm tree
justice' grounds, in deciding whether to actually make the order.
<P>

(iii)	The power conferred by section 588FF is one where:
<P>

	<i>`The word `may' is merely used to confer the authority:  and the authority
must be exercised, if the circumstances are such as to
call for its
exercise.'</i>
<P>

Taxation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20127%20CLR%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 127 CLR 106</a> at 134-135 (with whom Barwick CJ agreed at
128).  See also at 138-139 per Owen J.]
<P>

(iv)	The decision in <i>Re Pacific Hardware Brokers (Qld) Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2016%20ACLC%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 16
ACLC 442</a>, concerns a different situation to the present.  That was a case where
company funds were used to purchase an asset (an engagement
ring) which was
given to an unsuspecting third party.  The question was whether the third party
should be ordered to pay the value
of the asset to the company.  It is
understandable that there might be a discretion in such a case.  In any event,
the discretion
was there exercised in favour of ordering the payment of the
money.
<P>

570	If there was a discretion in the Court concerning the making of an order
under CODFA, I accept Cashflow's submission that it
would need to be exercised
in light of the purpose of section 588FF.  That purpose is, I accept, to ensure
that a creditor did not
receive a benefit over and above that received by other
creditors - <i>Pegulan Floor Coverings Pty Ltd v Carter</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLR%201293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLR 1293</a>
at 1301 column 1 per Doyle CJ.  Once it is shown that CODFA has received a
payment which is indeed an insolvent transaction, I accept
that there is no
room for operation of any discretion in the court.
<P>

571	CODFA's argument is, I accept, really the `running account' argument but
put in another guise.  If one looks at the WUPs on
a transaction by transaction
basis, I accept that each transfer of the money from Cashflow to CODFA has
reduced the indebtedness
of Cashflow to CODFA and thereby put CODFA into a
better position in the liquidation of Cashflow, than it would have been if that
payment had not been made.
<P>

572	CODFA submits that Cashflow is seeking to use Part 5.7B in an
unconscionable and impermissible way.  CODFA submits that Cashflow
is seeking
to `compound the theft' by ordering repayment of the partial restitution which
Walters had made.  Cashflow, in opposing
this submission, relied upon the
following matters:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	Cashflow submitted that to characterise the WUPs as `theft' is
legally incorrect and an emotional distraction.  Cashflow submitted
that theft
requires an asportation and carrying away of a chattel.  Cashflow submits that
this did not happen.  Cashflow also pointed
out that there are other criminal
offences connected with employees fraudulently depriving their employers of
property.  Cashflow
submitted that the question of whether theft, or any of
those other criminal offences, had been committed, had not been raised for
decision in these proceedings.
<P>

	Cashflow further submitted that another element of theft is that there be an
intent permanently to deprive the owner of the property
in a thing stolen.  The
pattern of dealings which Walters engaged in on Cashflow's submissions, I
accept, looks more like (or at
the least is equally consistent with) a series
of borrowings and payings back (or attempts to pay back) rather than attempts
to permanently
deprive CODFA of the moneys.  Cashflow further submitted that
the Court could not make a finding (particularly in Mr Walters' absence
and
particularly where he had not been given any notice that the allegation would
be made and particularly when the allegation is
a serious one) that Mr Walters
intended to permanently deprive CODFA of the money.
<P>

(ii)	Cashflow submitted that it is wrong to say that the amount of CODFA's
money that Mr Walters had `stolen' is $180,000.  The
submission was that the
fact is that Mr Walters had caused to be paid away a total of $1,240,641 of the
money of CODFA.  The submission
was that Mr Walters had caused CODFA to receive
back $1,060,641.  The submission was that if there was any `theft' by Mr
Walters,
it was a theft of $1,240,641.  Cashflow submitted that CODFA sought to
be put into a better situation than other creditors of Cashflow,
by not having
to bring back into the liquidation the partial repayments that it had received.
That, on Cashflow's submissions was
exactly what the voidable transaction
provisions was designed to prevent.
<P>

(iii)	Cashflow submitted that CODFA had assumed that it would be outrageous for
the preference provisions to operate to deprive
the victim of a thief of
restitution that had been made.  On Cashflow's submissions, that assumption is
incorrect.  Cashflow posits
an assumption that A has actually stolen $1million
from B and had then been overcome with remorse and sold all his assets and made
restitution to B and that within six months of making the restitution, A had
gone bankrupt with a deficiency of another $1million.
 In that situation,
Cashflow submitted that the preference provisions would claw back into the
bankruptcy, the amount that had been
paid to B as restitution, unless B could
establish the defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 122(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>.
<P>

(iv)	Cashflow submitted that in seeking to portray itself as `a victim of
theft', CODFA was ignoring the following facts:
<P>

<i>	</i>(a)	That it was CODFA's own officer, Mr Walters, who engineered the
payment out of CODFA's money in a way that was unauthorised.
<P>

(b)	That CODFA's own managing director, Mr Wright, signed every one of the
cheques by which the payment out of CODFA's money was
made.
<P>

(c)	That it was CODFA's own managing director, Mr Wright, who ran CODFA in such
a slack way that Mr Walters was able to carry out
his plans undetected and
unhindered.
<P>

(d)	That it was CODFA's other director, Mr Kull, who limited his involvement to
attendance at a monthly meeting.
<P>

573	Cashflow points out that any suggestion that was made sub silentio that
CODFA was a wronged innocent did not bear scrutiny.
<P>

	<b>Irrelevance of any Set-Off</b>
<P>

574	It is well established that if a transaction is a preference, it cannot be
the subject of a set-off - <i>Cf McPherson on the Law of Company
Liquidation</i>, 3rd Edition, page 385;  <i>Keay Avoidance Provisions in
Insolvency Law</i> LBC Information Services 1997 page 331.  The same rationale
must apply to a transaction which is a voidable uncommercial transaction.
<P>

	<b>Interest Payable on Any Preferential Payment which is Set Aside</b>
<P>

575	Cashflow submitted that when an order is made under section 588FF requiring
the repayment of a preferential payment, interest
should also be paid to the
liquidator - <i>Pegulan Floor Coverings Pty Ltd v Carter</i> (1997) 15 ACLC

(namely 26 September 1997).
<P>

	<b>The Claim of the Liquidator of Cashflow to Set Aside Transactions alleged
to be `Uncommercial Transactions' Pursuant to Section 588FB
Corporations
Law</b>
<P>

576	I accept Cashflow's submission that it entered uncommercial transactions
during the 12 months before 12 September 1996, these
being payment of $722,172
to CODFA.
<P>

577	Under section 588FC, those transactions are also `insolvent
transactions'.
<P>

578	Section 588FB reads as follows:
<P>

	<i>`1.	A transaction of a company is an uncommercial transaction of the
company if, and only if, it may be expected that a reasonable
person in the
company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction, having
regard to:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the detriment to the company of entering into the transaction;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the respective benefits to other parties to the transaction of entering
into it; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	any other relevant matter.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	A transaction may be an uncommercial transaction of a company because of
sub-section 1:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	whether or not a creditor of the company is a party to the transaction;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	even if the transaction is given effect to, or is required to be given
effect to, because of an order of an Australian Court or
a direction by an
agency.'</i>
<P>

579	Section 588FC provides:
<P>

	<i>`A transaction of a company is an insolvent transaction of the company if,
and only if, it is an unfair preference given by the company,
or an
uncommercial transaction of the company, and</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Any of the following happens at a time when the company is
insolvent:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the transaction is entered into;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	an act is done, or an omission is made, for the purpose of giving
effect to the transaction;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the company becomes insolvent because of, or because of matters
including:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	entering into the transaction;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	a person doing an act, or making an omission, for the purpose of
giving effect to the transaction.'</i>
<P>

580	The effect of the liquidator of Cashflow pleading that transactions during
the 12 months prior to the Relation Back Day are
uncommercial transactions is,
I accept, that the transactions which occurred during the six months before the
Relation Back Day are
attacked as preferences, and also attacked in the
alternative as uncommercial transactions.  Hence, if either attack succeeds the
transaction requires to be set aside.
<P>

581	I note that there is no equivalent to section 588FA(2) so far as
uncommercial transactions are concerned.  Hence, if the WUPs
during the last
six months in fact amount to a single transaction because of section 588FA(2),
they are still transactions which
need to be considered singly (and I accept
can be set aside singly) if they are uncommercial transactions.
<P>

582	I generally accept Cashflow's submissions that each of the WUPs is an
uncommercial transaction.  I accept that the reasons differ,
depending on
whether they are transactions which relate to Trans-pac, or to solvent clients
of Cashflow.  They also differ depending
on whether or not one adopts a
Clayton's Case approach to the allocation of payments between Cashflow and
CODFA.
<P>

583	So far as the transactions which relate to Trans-pac is concerned, I accept
as correct Cashflow's submission that a reasonable
person in Cashflow's
circumstances would not have repaid money to CODFA which had been advanced by
CODFA to Trans-pac.  At the start
of the 12 month period (that is to say 12
September 1995) (and accepting for the purposes of the analysis all payments
made by CODFA
which passed through the Cashflow bank account as ones which are
chargeable to Cashflow), Cashflow owed CODFA $80,000.  That debt,
I accept, had
arisen from the `Warrior' and `Scentinelle' cheques.  [These are cheque 6549
for $30,000 dated 17 August 1995 and cheque
6545 for $50,000 dated 18 August
1995 respectively].  These cheques had been paid into Cashflow's bank account,
and amounts of equal
magnitude paid out from Cashflow's bank account to
Trans-pac No. 1.  The account balance rose to $180,000 on 19 September, when
the
cheques 6651 for $100,000 was paid into the Cashflow bank account, and an
equal amount was then paid out to Trans-pac No. 1.
<P>

584	I further accept Cashflow's submission that it is preferable not to adopt a
Clayton's Case approach to the allocation of payments
made from Cashflow to
CODFA.  To my mind, this is indeed because Clayton's Case applies as a matter
of presumed intention to an ordinary
running account - <i>Creak v James Moore
&amp; Sons Pty Ltd</i> (1912) 15 CLR at 433-434 per Griffith CJ.  The evidence
suggests that Mr Walters had an intention to appropriate payments of particular
sums of money to `borrowings' of equal amount from CODFA.
<P>

585	I further accept as correct Cashflow's submissions that, even if one were
to adopt the Clayton's Case method of allocation to
the facts here proved, all
the payments would be uncommercial.  The reasons are as follows:
<P>

586	Adopting a Clayton's Case approach to the allocation of payments from
Cashflow to CODFA, the payment of $98,556 by Cashflow
on 7 September 1995 paid
off the whole of the $30,000 provided by CODFA on 17 August 1995, the whole of
the $50,000 that CODFA provided
on 18 August 1995 and $18,556 of the $98,556
that CODFA had provided on 1 September 1995.  The payment of $100,318 on 6
December
1998 repaid the $80,000 still outstanding from 1 September 1995 and in
addition, paid $20,318 of the $100,000 that had been provided
by CODFA on 19
September 1995.  The $16,699 paid by Cashflow on 7 December 1998 also paid off
part of the $100,000 from CODFA on
19 September 1995 (reducing the amount owing
from that $100,000 to $62,983).  That $62,983 was repaid in total by the
payment which
Cashflow is proven to have made to CODFA on 5 January1996.  Each
of the payments made on 6 December 1995, 7 December 1995 and 5 January
1996, is
an uncommercial transaction in that a reasonable person in the company's
circumstances would not, I accept, have paid that
money to CODFA.  The reasons
for this are as follows:
<P>

<i>	</i>(i)	The payment was to repay a `loan' from CODFA to Cashflow, which was
unauthorised by CODFA, and unauthorised by Cashflow.
<P>

(ii)	The proceeds of the `loan' had been applied in a way that was completely
outside the scope of Walters' authority to act on
behalf of Cashflow (and
indeed contrary to his instructions about how to deal with a client).
<P>

(iii)	The `loan', and the `repayment' were each kept secret from the Board of
Cashflow.
<P>

(iv)	The transaction with Trans-pac had conferred no benefit on Cashflow (or
alternatively a benefit worth considerably less than
it's face value).
<P>

587	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that the test that section 588FB
establishes for an uncommercial payment is not one
of whether, on analysis,
there is a legal obligation on Cashflow to repay the money that has come from
CODFA.  Rather, it is whether
a reasonable person in the company's
circumstances would have entered into the transaction, having regard to the
four identified
criteria.  Legal obligations can, of course, arise from wildly
uncommercial transactions.  I accept Cashflow's submission that what
section
588FB looks to is whether the transaction is out of the ordinary course of
commerce.  To the extent that there is a legal
obligation on Cashflow to repay
the money of CODFA that Walters has passed through Cashflow's bank account and
again to Trans-pac,
CODFA is able to prove in the liquidation.
<P>

588	CODFA did submit that the transactions are not uncommercial because a
reasonable person would `repay stolen moneys'.   That
analysis seems to me
flawed in its failure to take into account all of the circumstances.
<P>

589	Further, section 588FB(1) does not permit the decision as to whether a
reasonable person would have entered the transaction
to be made on a completely
unfettered basis.  I accept Cashflow's submission that rather, the decision is
to be made whether a reasonable
person in the company's circumstances would
have entered the transaction `having regard to' the matters listed in
paragraphs (a)
to (d).  When a statute says that a decision is to be made
`having regard to' certain matters, that, I accept, usually means that
the
decision-maker must give weight to the specified matters, as a fundamental
element in making the decision.

<P>

<i>	</i>The criteria that are here listed are <u>ordinary</u> commercial
ones.
<P>

590	Cashflow also submitted that on a Clayton's case analysis, part of two of
the three payments was used to repay a debt which
arose from sources other than
a payment for Trans-pac.  Cashflow then submitted that there is no basis in
section 588FB to strike
down only part of a payment.  I accept that submission
as one of substance.  In the result, the whole of those two payments meet
the
test for being an uncommercial transaction, even though in part, two of them
repaid debt other than the $180,000 that found it's
way to Trans-pac.  Hence
the whole of the three payments ought be set aside.
<P>

591	Part of the three payments were used to pay off amounts which went from
CODFA to solvent clients of Cashflow.  I accept Cashflow's
submission that
whilst this was not as irregular a transaction as the transactions where
Walters caused Trans-pac to receive the
money, it remained an uncommercial
transaction.  The payment was to `repay' a `loan' from CODFA to Cashflow, which
was unauthorised
by CODFA, and unauthorised by Cashflow.  The proceeds of the
`loan' had been applied in a way that was completely outside the scope
of
Walters' authority to act on behalf of Cashflow and was contrary to his
instructions about how to deal with a client.  Further,
the `loan', and the
`repayment' were each kept secret from the Board of Cashflow.
<P>

592	I accept as correct Cashflow's submission that analogous reasoning applies
to all the payments which appear in GMG4 during the
last 12 months before the
Relation Back Day.  All the amounts paid by Cashflow to CODFA I accept, ought
be set aside as uncommercial
transactions.
<P>

593	Cashflow further submitted that even if one were not to adopt the Clayton's
Case approach to the allocation of payments made
to, and from, CODFA and
Cashflow, the result would be the same.  I accept this submission as one of
substance.  The inference, I
accept, is clear that Mr Walters regarded some of
the WUPs as temporary `borrowings' which were `repaid'.  I accept that the
preferable
approach is to attribute a `repayment' of $X to a `loan' of $X.  The
effect of this way of allocating the payments from Cashflow
to CODFA will be
different to what it is on a Clayton's Case approach, but I accept Cashflow's
submission that the end result is
the same.
<P>

594	If one links repayments in this fashion, the `borrowings' which were not
for solvent clients of Cashflow are those marked in
colour on the annotated
version of GMG4.  The `repayments' of those `borrowings' occurred (in part) by
the payments from the Cashflow
account on 10 May 1996, 13 May 1996 and 9 August
1996 (totalling $170,000).  Those, I accept, are uncommercial transactions on
the
basis that a repayment of a `borrowing' made to fund a Trans-pac payment,
is uncommercial.  All the other repayments, which can be
linked to specific
`borrowings' for solvent clients of Cashflow are also uncommercial for reasons
already given.
<P>

595	In the result, for the reasons set out above, each of the uncommercial
payments occurred whilst the company was insolvent. 
Each of the four
alternatives in section 588FC(a)(i), 588FC(a)(ii), 588FC(b)(i) and 588FC(b)(ii)
is, I accept, applicable.  Each
is therefore an insolvent transaction.
<P>

596	Being transactions which are both uncommercial, and insolvent, and entered
into during the period of twelve months ending on
the Relation Back Day, each
of the transactions is voidable.
<P>

597	Cashflow also directed submissions to the approach which it was suggested
would apply if contrary to Cashflow's primary submissions,
the repayments of
the `borrowings' for solvent clients of Cashflow were not treated as
uncommercial, and if a non-Clayton's Case
method of allocating the payments
were to be adopted.  That submission was that the payments by Cashflow which
were not to repay
`borrowings' for solvent clients were as follows:
<P>

	10 May 1996	$20,000
<P>

13 May 1996	$50,000
<P>

9 August 1996	$100,000
<P>

598	On that alternative submission, Cashflow contended that it was those
transactions totalling $170,000 which should be set aside
as uncommercial.  It
is unnecessary to now deal with that alternative submission as Cashflow's
primary submission has been accepted.
<P>

599	Cashflow submitted that when a transaction is set aside as uncommercial, it
should be ordered to be repaid to the liquidator
together with interest from
the date of the liquidator's demand, namely 26 September 1997.
<P>

	<b>The disputed $20,000 payment </b>
<P>

600	As to the disputed sum of $20,000 paid out of CODFA's bank account on 2
April 1996, the evidence establishes that the payment
was made on the account
of Cashflow.  The disputed sum was brought to account between Cashflow and
Trans-pac No 1 in the records
of Cashflow.  [Exhibit D1Q (second entry)]
<P>

601	CODFA at no time had a commercial relationship with either of Trans-pac No
1 or Trans-pac No 2.  I accept CODFA's submission
that `whether or not
Cashflow's commercial relationship with Trans-pac No 1 was `irregular', insofar
as it involved payments and
receipts outside the two companies normal factoring
agreement, the fact is that they had a commercial relationship'.
<P>

	<b>Office Services Fee Issues</b>
<P>

602	The amounts of the office services fee paid monthly by Cashflow to Codfa
are shown in the right-hand column of Annexure `AO'
to Mr Bonvino's affidavit
of 27 April 1998.  The amounts are as follows:
<P>

	Date		Amount
<P>

30 June 1995      $18,800
<P>

31 July 1995            1,680
<P>

31 August 1995       2,830
<P>

<P>

31 January 1996      3,800
<P>

28 February 1996    2,670
<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<b>Total                     27,650</b>
<P>

603	Cashflow puts forward various alternative bases for its claim against CODFA
in respect of the office services fee.
<P>

604	I note that the calculation of the amount to be paid was performed by Mr
Walters on the basis of the fees that he asserted were
earned by Cashflow and
by CODFA.
<P>

605	It will be recalled that the Relation Back Day was 12 September 1996.
<P>

606	The total of the office services fees paid in the period from 12 months
before the Relation Back Day amounts to $23,140.
<P>

607	The first alternative way Cashflow put its case is that payment of fees in
the sum of $23,140 is an uncommercial transaction
within section 588FB
Corporations Law.  This is because it is said that the calculation of the
amount of the fees was done on the
basis of incorrectly treating fees accrued
in Cashflow's accounts as falling due from Trans-pac as really earned.  It is
then put
that during the whole of the 12 months before the Relation Back Day,
the amount of fees that accrued due in the accounts included
some fees which
were not earned at all, because they were `earned' on fictional invoices.  It
is said that they also included some
fees which were said to be factoring fees,
at a time when Trans-pac No 1 was not factoring debts (because Mr Walters was
making advances
in the hope that invoices would become available for factoring
and there were fundamental departures from the Factoring Agreement),
and so it
is put that no fees fell due.  It is also put that they also treated the `fees'
as earned from Trans-pac at a time when
Trans-pac No 1 was insolvent and the
fees would never be actually received.  Additionally it is put that they also
included (in the
period after November 1995) factoring fees which were
calculated by reference to invoices which were really the result of Trans-pac
No 2 carrying on business, so that no factoring fees could possibly be earned
by Cashflow.  All these reasons are put forward by
Cashflow in support of the
proposition that the payment of the office services fee in the amount that it
was paid, was an uncommercial
transaction.
<P>

608	The consequence of accepting Cashflow's first way of putting its case on
office services fee, would be that the amount of $23,140
would be set aside as
an uncommercial transaction and that CODFA would be obliged to pay to Cashflow
the amount of $23,140 plus interest
from 26 September 1997.  Cashflow accepts
that upon the making of that payment, CODFA would be entitled to prove in the
liquidation
for ($23,140 minus $17,203) equals $5,937 on account of the office
services fee.  The $17,203 overpayment is referred to below.
<P>

609	The second way in which Cashflow puts its claim in an alternative, is to
refer to the total of the fees paid from and including
1 December 1995 as being
$15,630.  That is said to cover a time when there was no factoring at all (not
even purported factoring)
being carried out with Trans-pac No 1.  Cashflow says
that there is no basis whatever on which it was entitled to receive a fee from
Trans-pac No 2.  Thus Cashflow submits that the payment of the fees of $15,630
is an uncommercial transaction.
<P>

610	If the second argument of Cashflow is successful, Cashflow submits that the
amount of $15,630 would be set aside as an uncommercial
transaction and that
CODFA would be obliged to pay to the liquidator $15,630 plus interest from 26
September 1997.  The submission
is that upon making of that payment CODFA will
not be entitled to prove in the liquidation on account of the office services
fee
and Cashflow will be entitled to set-off the amount of ($17,203 minus
$15,630) equals $1,573 against any amount for which CODFA is
entitled to prove
arising from the WUPs.
<P>

611	The third alternative way of putting it's case by Cashflow is to submit
that whether or not there is an uncommercial transaction
concerning the office
services fee, the fact is that there has been a simple overpayment by Cashflow,
relating to the period to the
end of June 1996.  What is here sought by
Cashflow is to enable recovery of the overpayment of office services fees to
include all
fees which had been overpaid.  Cashflow submits that the office
services fee properly payable (by reference to the <u>actual</u> fees received
of CODFA and Cashflow) in the 1995 and 1996 financial years was less than the
amount of fees actually paid by Cashflow
and that it is entitled to receive
credit for the difference.  Cashflow submits that the quantum of that
difference is $17,203 and
in this regard relies upon Mr Bonvino's evidence
given on his affidavit of 11 March 1999 paragraphs 5 and 6 to be referred to
below.
 Cashflow submits that to the extent to which that excess of $17,203 is
an insolvent transaction, it is to be set aside;  that to
the extent to which
it is not an insolvent transaction but was nonetheless paid, it is to be set
off against any liability that Cashflow
has to CODFA (so reducing CODFA's right
to prove in Cashflow's liquidation), or added to the amount that CODFA must pay
to Cashflow.
<P>

612	In short, Cashflow submits that it's third alternative argument which is
put on the basis that it completely fails in setting
aside any of the office
services fee as uncommercial transactions, will result in Cashflow still being
entitled to set-off the amount
of $17,203 against any amount for which CODFA is
entitled to prove arising from the WUPs.
<P>

613	Cashflow's submission is essentially that the payments of the office
services fee should be set aside.  It's submission is that
CODFA should repay
the amount of the fees received with interest from the date of the liquidator's
demand or alternatively the date
of the filing of the amended defence and
amended cross-claim in proceedings 50177 of 1997, namely 26 September 1997.
Cashflow submits
that CODFA will have a right to be admitted as a creditor in
the liquidation for the amount that is owing for office services fees,
based on
a correct calculation of the amount due.
<P>

614	In Mr Bonvino's affidavit of 11 March 1999, he deposed in paragraphs 5 and
6 as follows:
<P>

	<i>`Cashflow has claimed from COD Factors Australia Pty Limited ("CODFA") in
the proceedings the sum of $17,203.00, as an overpayment
of the office services
fee.  Cashflow shared the office expenses of CODFA, by making a contribution to
those expenses, pro rata to
the fees received by it when compared to the fees
received by CODFA.  The office services fee overpayment has been calculated by
me by not taking into account the "fees" received by Cashflow from Trans-Pac,
on the basis that such fees are mere accruals, and
will not be
recovered.</i>
<P>

<i>	For example, in 1995, I have calculated that the actual fees received by
Cashflow, leaving aside accrued fees in the Trans-Pac loan
account, was
$205,092.00.  the actual fees received by CODFA was $825,441.00.  Accordingly,
total fees received by both Cashflow
and CODFA amounted to $1,030,533.00.  the
actual contribution that Cashflow paid to CODFA in respect of the office
expenses for 1995
was $18,800.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	This contribution was calculated on the basis that Cashflow had received
fees from Trans-Pac.  However, if Cashflow's contribution
is calculated on the
basis of actual fees received of $205,092.00, as a percentage of the total fees
of $1,035,533.00, the amount
that Cashflow should have paid was $10,577.00.
Accordingly, the overpayment amounts to $8,222.00.</i>
<P>

<i>	I have made a similar calculation of the overpayment of the office services
fee for 1996.  Annexed and marked "D" is a true copy
of a document entitled
"Expense Transfer from COD Aust to Cashflow",prepared by CODFA.  The hand
written numbers and words on the
document have been made by me.  The statements
I made in the immediately preceding paragraph in relation to 1995 are repeated
in
summary form on the document.  Similarly, in relation to 1996, I calculated
the actual fees received by Cashflow after reversal of
the Trans-Pac fees.  I
have written in a separate column in the schedule entitled "Cashflow actual
fees received", and those actual
fees amount to $395,514.00.  As a percentage
of the total actual fees of both Cashflow and CODFA, the amount that should
have been
paid by Cashflow as a contribution to CODFA's office expenses was
$20,686.00 in respect of the 1996 period.  In fact, Cashflow paid
$29,667.00,
resulting in an overpayment of $8,981.00.  The total overpayments for the 1995
year and the 1996 year, being $8,222.00
and $8,981.00 respectively, amount to
$17,203.00.'</i>
<P>

615	Mr Bonvino, as Cashflow points out, was not cross-examined on this
evidence.
<P>

616	CODFA in turn, disputes the claim for relief made by Mr Star to the alleged
overpayment of office services fees by Cashflow
to CODFA during the financial
years ended June 1995 and June 1996.
<P>

617	CODFA claims that the evidence does not support Cashflow's claim that the
agreement between CODFA and Cashflow for sharing of
office expenses was based
on fees <u>recovered</u> and that this allowed for the reversing of fees at a
time following the payment by Cashflow of each month's contribution fee for
office expenses such as a later point in time permitting a claim for any
alleged overpayment of contribution fees.  CODFA submits
that the evidence
shows that the contribution fee payable by Cashflow for office expenses was
based on the amount for total fees
showed in the monthly profit and loss
statements of CODFA and Cashflow and thus was based on fees <u>accrued</u>.  In
this regard, CODFA relies upon the statement of Mr Kull dated 2 September 1998
at paragraph 21.
<P>

618	In Mr Kull's statement of 2 September 1998, he gave evidence which I
accept, that in about July 1994 in his discussions with
Mr Wright in relation
to the sharing of office expenses between Cashflow and CODFA, words to the
following effect were said:
<P>

	<i>`Mr Kull:	We need to work out a method for Cashflow to pay for office
expenses such as rent and electricity and other expenses such
as advertising,
computer costs, staff costs and your car and telephone expenses.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Wright:	Office expenses can be apportioned based on fees received by
CODFA and Cashflow during the previous months.  Whomever receives
more fees
pays more expenses.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Kull:	I agree.'</i>
<P>

619	Mr Kull's evidence in paragraphs 20 and 21 was that, to the best of his
knowledge, from about December 1994 to May 1996, Cashflow
paid to CODFA a
contribution fee for rent, advertising, cleaning, light/electricity, printing
and stationery, telephone and motor
vehicle expenses.  In this regard he
referred to the monthly profit and loss statements of CODFA and Cashflow for
the period December
1994 to May 1996.  He also gave evidence that his
understanding was that the figure for the total fees of both CODFA and Cashflow
used in the monthly expense transfer invoices were those shown in the profit
and loss statements produced monthly for each company.
<P>

620	In my judgment, the agreement between Cashflow and CODFA was as Cashflow
asserts, based on fees recovered so that that agreement
did allow for the
reversing of fees at a time following the payment by Cashflow of each month's
contribution fee at a later point
in time, permitting a claim for any alleged
overpayment of contribution fees.  A mechanism had to be put in place for
monthly payments
and this then followed the monthly profit and loss statements.
This is not to say that the agreement reached is to be taken to exclude
a later
verification of the actual fees recovered.
<P>

621	This means as CODFA submits, that Cashflow's entitlement to the sums
claimed depends upon a finding being made that it did not
recover any fees from
either Trans-pac No1 or Trans-pac No 2 and that all fees shown to be earned by
Cashflow and Trans-pac No 1
in their monthly profit and loss statements should
be reversed for the purpose of determining the correct contribution fee payable
by Cashflow to CODFA for office services.
<P>

622	To my mind there is substance in Cashflow's submission that Mr Bonvino, not
having been cross-examined on paragraphs 5 and 6
of his affidavit of 11 March
1999, the Court should accept as proved Cashflow's assertion that the amount in
respect of which the
office services fee properly payable by reference to the
actual fees received of CODFA and Cashflow in the 1995 financial year and
in
the 1996 financial year, was less than the amount of fees actually paid by
Cashflow is $17,203.
<P>

623	I remain unclear as to how the parties may seek to put that my acceptance
of paragraphs 5 and 6 of Mr Bonvino's affidavit of
11 March 1999 may affect
Cashflow's arguments put in alternatives 1 and 2 of it's written submissions.
It seems to me that it is
appropriate to give the parties an opportunity to
address further submissions on this matter before finally dealing with so much
of the office services fee issues as involve Cashflow's claims.
<P>

	<b>CODFA's Claim for Relief against Mr Star for Recovery of Office
Expenses</b>
<P>

624	CODFA makes a claim for relief against Mr Star for recovery of office
expenses in the sum of $6,050 said to be owed for the
use by Cashflow of
CODFA's office premises during the period 12 September 1996 to 28 February
1997.
<P>

625	At transcript page 22, on 18 March 1999 Mr Campbell QC accepted as I
understand the position, that CODFA is an unsecured creditor
for $6,050 in
relation to the office occupancy fee and that this amount is an expense of the
liquidation.  Earlier, on 16 March 1999
at transcript page 109, Mr Campbell had
responded as follows to the following submission by Mr Lindsay:
<P>

	<i>`His Honour:	The office expenses item, as I recall it, unless it is a
different framework, is something like possibly 17 or possibly
$23,000, is that
correct?</i>
<P>

<i>Lindsay:	That is the claim that is made a claim of that order.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Lindsay:	By Cashflow, based not only but largely upon the Corporations Law
uncommercial transaction provisions.  Mr Star, when he
became liquidator,
agreed with CODFA that he would pay, for memory it is something like $250 a
week or something like that, towards
office expenses.  That sum has not been
paid.  We don't understand the agreement to be in dispute for the non-payment
but as we understand
Mr Star's position, he just says:  "Well, I made that
agreement but any amount that I have to pay should be set-off against what
you
should pay me.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Campbell:	I might say this is something I overlooked.  So far as that is
concerned, we agree with the quantification of the office
expense that is
contained in my learned friend's pleading.  We accept that that amount is an
amount which is provable in liquidation
as an expense of liquidation and
therefore has a first priority of payment.'</i>
<P>

626	There is thus a concession as I understand on the issue.  I accept that
there was an agreement between CODFA and Mr Star that
in consideration of
Cashflow being permitted to use the premises and office services of CODFA, Mr
Star would pay $250 per week to
CODFA from the date of his appointment as
provisional liquidator until Cashflow ceased to occupy the office premises.
[See statement
of Mr Kull, 2 September 1998 paragraphs 33 and 34, letter from
Mr Star to CODFA dated 16 December 1998 and letter from Star Dean
Wilcocks to
CODFA dated 11 February 1997.]
<P>

627	I accept that Cashflow occupied the office premises of CODFA during the
period from Mr Star's appointment as provisional liquidator
on 12 September
1996 to March 1997 - see statement of Mr Kull dated 2 September 1998 at
paragraphs 28, 30, 31 and 39.
<P>

628	In the result, Mr Star owed CODFA $6,050 as office rent for the period 12
September 1996 to 28 February 1997.
<P>

629	To my mind, the agreement pursuant to which the office services fee was to
be paid is not an `uncommercial transaction' within
the meaning of section
588FB of the Corporations Law.  It was perfectly appropriate for the two
companies to reach the agreement
which they did at the time when it was entered
into for the sharing of office expenses.  A reasonable person in the
circumstances
of Cashflow would have, it seems to me, entered into the
transaction being the office services agreement having regard to the benefits
to Cashflow of entering into the transaction, the detriment to Cashflow of
entering into the transaction, the respective benefits
to both Cashflow and
CODFA being parties to that transaction on entering into it.  I do not see that
any other relevant matter proven
affects this conclusion.
<P>

630	The fact that calculation of the amount of the office services fees took
place on the basis of an incorrect treatment of fees
accrued in Cashflow's
accounts as falling due from Trans-pac as really earned, is simply a matter
which postdated the entry into
of the agreement and requires an adjustment in
respect of overpayment.
<P>

	<b>Further Submissions and Short Minutes</b>
<P>

631	The four sets of proceedings raised a large number of complex issues.  The
proceedings will be relisted for further submissions
in relation to: 
<P>

	(a)	any specific claims which any party contends has not yet been dealt
with;
<P>

(b)	matters in respect of which leave has been expressly reserved in the
Judgment for the addressing of further submissions;
<P>

<i>(c)	any area of overlap or incorrect addition or detail to be found in
schedules and the like in relation to calculations which, bearing
in mind the
matters adjudicated upon as a matter of principle, either party seeks to submit
ought be taken into account and/or corrected.</i>
