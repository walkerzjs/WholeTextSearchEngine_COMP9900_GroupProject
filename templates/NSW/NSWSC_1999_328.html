<i>Wednesday, 14 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3959 of 1997 	WAYNE LANCE FARLEY -v- JEANETTE 				BERTHA FARLEY</b>
<P>

<b>4021 of 1997	JEANETTE BERTHA FARLEY -v- WAYNE 				LANCE FARLEY</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i>
1982</a>. By summons 3959 of 1997 filed on 11 September 1997 Wayne Lance Farley
claims an order for provision for his maintenance, education
or advancement in
life out of the estate of his late father, Lance Robertson Farley (to whom I
shall refer as "the deceased"). I
shall in this judgment refer to Wayne Lance
Farley as "the plantiff".
<P>

2	The deceased died intestate on 17 March 1996, in circumstances to which I
shall shortly refer. 
<P>

3	By summons 4021 of 1997 filed on 16 September 1997 Jeanette Bertha Farley,
the widow of the deceased, claims an order for provision
for her maintenance
out of his estate. I shall in this judgment refer to Jeanette Bertha Farley as
"the defendant".
<P>

4	At the commencement of the hearing the following orders were made by
consent:
<P>

	(1)	I order that Wayne Lance Farley be named as 	defendant in proceedings 4021
of 1997.
<P>

	(2)	I order that proceedings 3959 of 1997 and 4021 of 	1997 be heard together,
and that the evidence in the 	one, so far as is
relevant, be treated as
evidence in the 	other.
<P>

5	I have already recorded that the deceased died intestate. Letters of
Administration of his intestate estate were on 19 September
1997 granted to the
defendant, Jeanette Bertha Farley, widow of the deceased.
<P>

6	The assets of the deceased at the time of his death consisted of the
following:
<P>

	(a)	Real property situate at and known as 54 Scheyville 	Road, Oakville,
having an estimated value of 	$350,000.
<P>

	(b)	Moneys in accounts with St. George Bank, totalling 	about $31,100.
<P>

	(c)	1985 Ford Fairlane motor vehicle, having an 	estimated value of $4,000.
<P>

7	It was not in dispute between the parties that the present value of the
Oakville property was in the range of $385,000 - $420,000,
and that it was
appropriate, for the purposes of the present proceedings, to adopt the figure
of $400,000.
<P>

8	The deceased (who had been born on 19 September 1925, and who was aged 70 at
the time of his death) had been married twice. Of
his first marriage, on 10
December 1951, was born only one child, the plaintiff (who was born on 30
September 1952 and who is presently
46 years of age).
<P>

9	The deceased separated from his first wife in June 1976, and they
subsequently divorced on 11 January 1978. 
<P>

10	In March 1980 the deceased purchased for $55,000 the Oakville property,
which constitutes the substantial asset in his estate.
That purchase was in
part funded by a bank loan of $21,877, which the deceased repaid in November
1981, a gift from his father in
that amount enabling him to effect such
repayment. At about the same time as he purchased the Oakville property the
deceased commenced
a de facto relationship with the defendant. A contribution
of $8,000 was made by the defendant towards the purchase of that property
(that
sum coming from the property settlement received by the defendant from her
first husband in their matrimonial proceedings).
<P>

11	In early February 1996 the deceased was diagnosed as suffering from terminal
cancer. A few days later, on 13 February 1996, the
deceased executed a will. By
that will, the deceased appointed the plaintiff to be executor, gave to the
defendant a right of residence
in the house property at Oakville for a maximum
period of two years, and directed that thereafter that property be sold and the
proceeds
of sale be held as to one half for the plaintiff and one half for the
defendant. The deceased gave the residue of his estate to one
Narelle Thomas.

<P>

12	The day after executing that will the deceased, on 14 February 1996, entered
hospital where he remained until his death. On 6
March 1996, some three weeks
after executing the will, the deceased married the defendant in hospital. The
effect of that marriage
was (by section 15 (1) of the <i>Wills, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and
Administration Act</i> 1898</a>) to revoke the will which the deceased had made
only three weeks earlier. It was in consequence of that revocation of his will
that
the deceased died intestate.
<P>

13	Upon intestacy, since the deceased left a wife (the defendant) and also left
issue (the plaintiff), and since the value of the
estate (excluding any
household chattels) exceeded the prescribed amount of $150,000, then (pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 61</a> B (3) of the Act) the household chattels, the prescribed amount
of $150,000, and one half of the estate (excluding the household
chattels and
the prescribed amount) shall be held in trust for the defendant and the residue
shall be held in trust for the plaintiff.
Further, since the deceased at the
time of his death held an interest in a dwelling house which was situated in
New South Wales,
then the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 61</a> D of the Act are called into
operation. The various circumstances set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and
(d) of that section exist
in the instant case. Normally, it would follow, that
the defendant widow, in addition to the foregoing assets passing to her upon
intestacy, should also receive the dwelling house. However, it will be
appreciated that the operative provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 61</a> D are by that section
provided to be "subject to the Fourth Schedule". That Schedule deals with the
rights of the surviving spouse
of an intestate with respect to acquisition of
the matrimonial home. 
<P>

14	The effect of the definition of "matrimonial home", and the definition of
"dwelling-house" in subsection (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 61</a> A, combined with the
provisions of clause 4 (in particular subclause (1)) of the Fourth Schedule, is
to give to the plaintiff upon
intestacy an entitlement only to the dwelling
house itself at 54 Scheyville Road, together with an area not exceeding 2,500
square
metres constituting the curtilage of that dwelling-house. 
<P>

15	It was not in dispute between the parties that the appropriate Local
Government authority would not allow a subdivision of the
subject property
(which comprises five acres), to enable the defendant to exercise her right
upon intestacy under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 61</a> D to"require the administrator to hold that
interest [in the dwelling house] in trust for the wife".
<P>

16	The consequence of the combined effect of the foregoing provisions of the
<i>Wills, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act</a></i> is (and the parties were in
agreement with such construction of the Act) that the defendant is not entitled
to the dwelling-house,
but that she is entitled to the household chattels, the
prescribed amount of $150,000 and one-half of the remaining estate (having
an
estimated value of $250,000 --- that is, an amount of $125,000. The other half
of the remaining estate ($125,000) would go to
the plaintiff. 
<P>

17	The plaintiff has been married twice. Of his first marriage was born a son,
Lance (who is presently aged 15). The plaintiff's
first marriage broke down in
about 1983 or 1984. The plaintiff married his present wife on 17 July 1993. She
has a daughter (presently
aged 17), the step-daughter of the plaintiff, who
resides with himself, his wife and his son.
<P>

18	The plaintiff and his wife conduct a cleaning business. Apparently that
business was formerly conducted by them in partnership.
It would appear
(although the evidence was not particularly precise concerning the relationship
between the partnership and the company)
that that business is now conducted by
a company, Farley Group Pty. Limited, which is controlled by the plaintiff and
his wife, who
are the sole directors and shareholders of that company.
<P>

19	The plaintiff and his wife jointly own a house property at 8 Tranquility
Crescent, Bribie Island (a suburb of Brisbane) in Queensland.
That house
property has a present estimated value of $165,000. It is subject to a
mortgage, securing a presently outstanding amount
of $119,000. The plaintiff
has a savings account, standing at $9,200. He leases a motor vehicle, whilst
his wife owns a 1976 Suzuki
jeep. In addition, the company owns a Range Rover,
which the plaintiff sometimes uses. The company has net assets of $22,000. The
plaintiff in the last financial year had an estimated gross income of $42,000,
whilst his wife had an estimated gross income $25,000.
Neither the plaintiff
nor his wife has any superannuation entitlement.
<P>

20	The plaintiff left his parental home when he was aged 19, in about 1971, to
pursue an apprenticeship. After his parents separated
in 1975 he had little
face to face contact with his father until the death his paternal grandfather
(that is, the father of the deceased)
in 1986. 
<P>

21	The plaintiff was cross-examined with a view to establishing that he was, in
effect, alienated from his father. 
<P>

22	Whatever be the extent of the contact between the plaintiff and the
deceased, it is quite clear from the terms of the will which
the deceased
executed on 13 February 1996 that the deceased himself was not dissatisfied
with the extent of that contact, and that
he wished, under the terms of that
will, to benefit his son, the plaintiff, equally with his then de facto spouse
(but subsequently
his wife), the defendant.
<P>

23	The defendant was born on 21 May 1939, and is presently aged 59. 
<P>

24	She was married in about 1959, and divorced in 1978. I have already recorded
that a de facto relationship commenced between the
defendant and the deceased
in 1980, at about the same time as the deceased purchased the Oakville
property. 
<P>

25	Upon the death of his father in 1986 the deceased received one half of the
residue of that estate. The evidence does not disclose
the actual sum he
received, although it is unlikely to have exceeded $100,000 (since the gross
estate was $219,536, and legacies
and specific gifts totalled $8,600). The
deceased subsequently used that sum towards building a new residence upon the
Oakville property.
That residence was constructed in 1990, being completed in
September of that year. The defendant contributed $25,000 (which she had
received by way of an inheritance from an aunt) towards the construction and
the furnishing of that residence.
<P>

26	The deceased, who had worked as a section manager at the Hawkesbury
Agricultural College, retired from that employment in September
1994. He then
worked part-time for Swayne's Nursery for a period of about two years. 
<P>

27	The evidence discloses that the deceased and the defendant constructed very
attractive gardens and landscaping upon the Oakville
property, and devoted a
great deal of their time to horticultural pursuits upon that property.
<P>

28	The plaintiff as a son of the deceased is an eligible person within
paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such he has the standing to bring the
present proceedings. The defendant, as the widow of the deceased, is also an
eligible person,
within paragraph (a) of that definition. She also has the
standing to bring her proceedings under the Act.
<P>

29	The only other person who may possibly be an eligible person is the other
beneficiary named in the will of 13 February 1996,
being Narelle Thomas.
Although served with a notice of claim, she has not chosen to pursue any claim
against the estate of the deceased.
Accordingly, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 20</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>, the Court is in the present proceedings entitled
to disregard the interests of that lady.
<P>

30	The defendant and the deceased lived together for 16 years. Throughout
almost the entirety of that period they lived in the Oakville
property. The
defendant contributed to the purchase of that property by advancing $8,000 from
her Family Court settlement with her
first husband. She also contributed
towards the construction and the furnishing of the house, not only the sum of
$25,000 (to which
I have already referred), but also part of her earnings. The
defendant contributed to the conservation of the property by assisting
in
cultivating flower gardens, assisting in planting and harvesting flowers,
assisting in the erection of a greenhouse and the clearing
of the paddocks.
After the deceased retired, the defendant was the sole breadwinner for the
household. She also made important contributions
as a homemaker, which included
looking after the deceased's own mother while she was ill, and also nursing the
deceased at home during
his final illness. 
<P>

31	The defendant is employed as a clerical officer with the Department of
Education at the South Windsor Public School. She receives
$390 (net) a week
from that employment, and she has no other income. It had been the defendant's
intention to retire at the age of
60, which age she will shortly attain.
However, she now expects that it will be necessary for her to work somewhat
longer. Her income
is modest, and is barely sufficient to meet her expenses.
<P>

32	The practical effect of the application of the statutory provisions to which
I have already adverted upon the administration
of the intestate estate of the
deceased is to require the sale of the Oakville property. That sale, would, of
course, deprive the
defendant of her home.
<P>

33	An attempt was made on the part of the plaintiff to establish that the
defendant should be accommodated in some other residence,
so that the plaintiff
could receive at least the amount to which she would be entitled on intestacy,
if not a larger share than one-half
of the remainder, after the receipt by the
defendant of the household chattels and the first $150,000 (the prescribed
amount).
<P>

34	I have already expressed my conclusion that whatever might have been the
extent of the contact between the plaintiff and the
deceased, the deceased
appears to have been satisfied with that contact, and that the terms of his
will of 13 February 1996 reflect
no dissatisfaction with the conduct of the
plaintiff in that regard. 
<P>

35	The problem in the instant case is that, apart from the Oakville property,
there is very little in the estate to meet what might
otherwise be the
legitimate claims of each of the parties. It must be appreciated, also, that
out of the assets of the estate other
than the Oakville property (being cash in
the sum of $23,361) the costs of defendant, as administrator, must be met in
upholding
the statutory provisions of the intestacy. In the event that the
plaintiff were to be successful in the proceedings, he would be
entitled also
to an order for his costs out of the estate. The amount of cash is not
sufficient to meet both sets of costs (estimates
of which have, in accordance
with the usual procedure, been provided by each party, in amounts totalling
$30,000)
<P>

36	It has often been said that, in the case of a marriage for a substantial
period (and, in the instant case, I would equate the
de facto relationship
between the defendant and the deceased with such a marriage), the obligation of
a testator is, to the extent
that his assets so enable him, to ensure that his
widow is secure in her accommodation, that she is able to live at a standard no
less than that which she enjoyed during the lifetime of her husband, and that
she has a fund to meet any contingencies.
<P>

37	In the instant case, were the provisions upon intestacy to take effect (let
alone, were the plaintiff to receive an amount greater
than that to which he is
entitled upon intestacy), the inevitable practical consequence would be to
dispossess the defendant of her
residence. That is something which I am not
disposed to permit.
<P>

38	In all the circumstances, therefore, even though, had the estate been
larger, it might be that the plaintiff could have established
an entitlement to
an order for provision equal to or even exceeding the amount to which he would
have been entitled upon intestacy,
I am satisfied that the claim of the
defendant as the widow of the deceased is a claim of a higher order than that
of the plaintiff.

<P>

39	Accordingly, the defendant should receive the Oakville property absolutely.
She is also entitled to an order for her costs out
of the estate. I have not
heard any submissions as to whether she is entitled to an order that the
defendant should pay her costs.
It is possible that, in the event that the
defendant were to pay the costs of the plaintiff of the proceedings 4021 of
1997, then
there would be a small balance left in the estate, and the plaintiff
would be entitled to share in that balance. The parties should
have an
opportunity to be heard concerning costs; in particular, whether the costs of
the defendant should be paid by the plaintiff.
<P>

40	Accordingly, unless within seven days of the date hereof either party
arranges with my Associate for the matter to be listed
before me for argument
as to costs, I make the following orders:
<P>

	3959 of 1997 Wayne Lance Farley v. Jeanette Bertha Farley
<P>

	1. 	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

	2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the 	defendant.
<P>

	4021 of 1997 Jeanette Bertha Farley v Wayne Lance Farley
<P>

	1.	I order that the plaintiff hold the entire estate of the 	late Lance
Robertson Farley ("the deceased") for her 	own benefit
absolutely.
<P>

	2. 	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the 	plaintiff.
<P>
