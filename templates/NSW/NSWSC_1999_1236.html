<b><u>20112 / 97  -  Jamie Lee RYAN by his Tutor Nancy Joan Ryan  v  State Rail
Authority of New South Wales</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:    </b>In these proceedings the plaintiff
claims damages for personal injuries suffered by him when he fell from a moving
wheat train at
Werris Creek on 4 September 1995 at about 7.15 pm when he was
aged 13 years, having been born on 3 February 1982.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	To understand the plaintiff's case it is necessary to give
some general description of the Werris Creek railway establishment
as it was at
the time and as it largely still is.
<P>

3   	Werris Creek is only a small town but it is and was the
centre of railway operations in the north west of the state, being
the junction
of the Main North Line to Tenterfield and the North West Line to Moree and
Mungindi, the lines meeting at the southern
end of the railway station in the
form of a y-intersection.  It also has and had extensive shunting yards mainly
south of the passenger
station and known as South Box.  North west of the
station and close to and running off the Moree and Mungindi Line is a bulk
wheat
siding and further to the east about half way between the bulk wheat
siding and the Main North Line was formerly another goods siding
which was no
longer in use in 1995 and the tracks of which were no longer connected to the
tracks which were in use, although the
former tracks had not been entirely
removed.  East of that former goods siding was what has been described as the
SRA Perway Yard
used by railway staff which had some small buildings on it.
<P>

4   	Access to the passenger station was by road leading from
the main street north of the station by a level crossing across the
Main North
Line and then along a road to a car park near the northern end of the station,
or by a footbridge from the main street
to near the northern end of the car
park.
<P>

5   	Between the western boundary of the Perway Yard and the
north eastern boundary of the Moree-Mungundi Line was private grazing
land
fenced with a five strand barbed wire fence meeting its apex at a strainer
corner fence post.
<P>

6   	These various features are depicted in Ex. C, and the
photos taken 15 December 1995 (Ex. A) whilst the corner fence post is
shown in
Ex. 1.  Along the southern and western boundaries of the car park there was in
September 1995 a steel mesh fence about 3-4
feet high shown in the bottom right
hand corner of Ex. A2, and in Exs. B1 and B7 and on the south west boundary of
the railway area
was a wire netting fence about 7 feet high topped with two
strands of barbed wire shown in Exs. B8, B9 and B10.  There was at that
time no
fence between the Perway Yard and the Moree-Mungindi Line from the end of the
car park to the commencement of the private
grazing land at the strainer corner
fence post.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff said that on the evening in question he met
three of his mates, Jamie MacBeath, Garry MacBeath and Jarrod Kirkwood
and went
with them to the western side of the footbridge where they talked for a while.
After some time they heard a train coming
from the direction of the silos but
not from the silos themselves, so he and Jarrod Kirkwood walked down to the
railway line and
onto the track area.  They walked further along the track
towards the silos and hid behind a tree, the route taken being marked by
him on
Ex. D.  There was no fence to stop them and he said that if the fence that is
there now had been there he would not have attempted
to climb over it.  They
watched the train, which was a wheat train, approach and after the locomotive
went past they came out from
behind the tree, ran along the side of the train
and jumped up onto the ladders on the side of it.  The plaintiff said he jumped
on, climbed over the top of the wagon so that he was on the other side and was
climbing down the ladder on the other side of the
wagon when his foot slipped,
he felt numbness and knew what had happened, hit the ground and that was it.
He said that he had done
a similar thing a couple of times before, that is
climbing onto the ladders of the moving freight trains, but this was the first
time he had attempted to climb up one side of the wagon and climb down the
other side.  
<P>

8   	He was not challenged on this account of what happened, but
it is somewhat different to what he said when interviewed by police
on 22
October 1995 (Ex. 4).  On that occasion he said "and the train came and I
jumped from the station side and went through the
gap between the carriage, I
jumped off, I went to get back on again and one foot slipped through the rail
of the ladder.  I felt
it go under the wheel and I was sitting on the ladder on
the bottom step then I thought I better get off so I pushed myself off and
onto
the ground."  In other words he indicated on the earlier occasion that he had
not climbed over the top of the wagon to get from
one side to the other, but
had moved around in the space between two successive wagons, and had actually
got off and was climbing
up the other side rather than climbing down at the
time he lost his footing and slipped.  
<P>

9   	He agreed that he knew that the activity was wrong and that
it was dangerous, and that if they had been seen by any responsible
adult near
the railway line they would have been told to leave.  There was evidence that
children and young people did tend to use
the Werris Creek Railway Station and
adjoining car park for riding bikes, skateboards and other recreational
activities, but that
whenever railway staff saw them they were told to leave or
were hunted away.  There was no evidence that youths had actually played
on or
adjacent to the railway tracks or that railway staff had been aware of the
plaintiff's previous couple of escapades joy-riding
the wagons.  
<P>

10   	It appears that the plaintiff's shoe was found almost
level with the boundary of the private grazing land to the north-west
of the
railway area near the fence corner post and the plaintiff himself was opposite
the northern building on the railway station
marked as "recovery point" on Ex.
C.  Neither the driver of the train nor his assistant saw the plaintiff or his
companion, Kirkwood,
and the only other railway employee on duty at the time
was engaged at the southern end of the platform to exchange the staff and
adjust the points so that the train could enter the South Box marshalling
yards.  He could not have been expected to see the plaintiff
and his companion
either cross the Perway Yard or go onto the lines, and as previously noted when
they got there they hid behind
a tree until the locomotive went past. 
<P>

11   	Since the accident, a steel mesh fence about 6 feet high
has been constructed from the end of the car park to the commencement
of the
private grazing land at the strainer corner fence post as shown in Exs. B1 and
B7 and shown by a dotted green line on Exs.
C and D.  This fence is identical
to one which has been erected on both sides of the line for the whole length of
the railway track
through the built up area of the City of Tamworth.  If in
place it would have effectively blocked the access route used by the plaintiff
on the night in question.  It was not erected in order to prevent access by
unauthorised persons to the railway line but to prevent
SRA staff when driving
vehicles from gaining access to the authorised level crossing leading into the
car park from a position inside
the gate and the warning sign.  It was not
expensive to erect and took about a week to build.  There is, and has for many
years also
been, a post and wire mesh fence topped by two strands of barbed
wire about 7 feet high on the western side of the railway area as
shown in Exs.
B, 8, 9 and 10.
<P>

<b>Liability</b>
<P>

12   	Mr Grieve QC on behalf of the defendant relied on the
facts that the plaintiff was a trespasser on the defendant's property
and that,
although children were known to the defendant's agents to play on the railway
station from where they were moved on, there
was no evidence that the defendant
knew or had reason to believe that the plaintiff or any other children were
playing on or near
the actual railway tracks or that they were climbing onto
and over moving wheat wagons.  He accordingly submitted that the defendant
owed
no duty of care to the plaintiff, and alternatively, if it did owe such a duty,
it was not in breach thereof.
<P>

13   	A number of particulars of negligence were alleged in the
statement of claim, but having regard to the fact that the plaintiff
and his
companion moved to the area adjoining the railway tracks under cover of
darkness and then hid behind a tree to avoid detection
by the driver of the
locomotive, and the plaintiff's frank and honest admission that warning signs
would not have deterred him, the
only particular on which the plaintiff
ultimately placed reliance was the failure to erect fences around the track in
the area of
Werris Creek Station.
<P>

14   	Nowadays it is not necessary to consider the different
categories of entrant and the separate duties owed to those different
categories but the issue is whether, in all the relevant circumstances
including the fact of the defendant's occupation of the premises
and the manner
of the plaintiff's entry upon them, the defendant owed a duty of care to the
plaintiff under the ordinary principles
of negligence; and the touchstone is
that there be reasonable forseeability of a real risk of injury to the visitor
or to the class
of person of which the visitor is a member:  <b><i>Australian
Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a>; at 488 citing
Deane J in <b><i>Hackshaw v Shaw</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/84.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 84</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155 CLR 614</a> at 662-3.
<P>

15   	In this case the nature of the defendant's occupation was
that it used the land for the passage of trains, objects which because
of their
movement, bulk, weight and, at times, speed are inherently dangerous.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff was a trespasser in that he was on or near
the railway tracks without permission and for no lawful purpose,
and his actual
presence in that area was not known to any of the defendant's servants; but it
was known that from time to time children
played on the railway station and in
my view it was reasonably foreseeable that young persons, boys in particular,
would be attracted
to the moving trains, and it was also foreseeable that if
they got onto or close to the lines they could be injured in a variety
of ways,
even if they did not try and jump on or ride moving wagons, but even that was a
foreseeable possibility in respect of boys
of a certain age.
<P>

17   	The law has long recognised that children are attracted to
things which do not attract adults and this "allurement" has been
recognised as
relevant to the duty of care owed, particularly to child trespassers e.g.

392</a> at 400; <b><i>Pederson v Barclay and ors</i></b> (unreported - NSW Supreme
Court - Dunford J - 27 June 1996).
<P>

18   	In my opinion the risk of young boys going onto the
railway line was reasonably foreseeable and was not far fetched or fanciful,
and accordingly the plaintiff was under a duty to take reasonable care to
prevent injury to such persons, including the plaintiff.
 This could have been
done simply and economically by erecting a fence where one was subsequently
erected.  It matters not that the
fence was ultimately erected for another
purpose; it could and should have been erected to prevent, or at least hinder,
access to
the railway lines and moving trains.  Young persons were known to
congregate and/or play on the platform and in the area of the car
park and
Perway Yard and these areas were connected by the footbridge to the main street
of the town, yet the lines where trains
ran past these areas were not fenced
off.  At one stage Mr Grieve sought to test the matter by proposing that the
fence could not
have been built whilst the now disused siding was still in use,
but the fence could have at that stage been built to the east of
that siding,
and been equally effective.
<P>

19   	I am accordingly satisfied that the defendant owed a duty
of care to the plaintiff and was in breach of that duty.  As the
plaintiff
clearly suffered damage, the defendant is accordingly liable in negligence.
<P>

20   	On the issue of contributory negligence, a young person is
expected to exercise the degree of care for his or her own safety
as would
reasonably be expected of a child of the same age, intelligence and experience:
<b><i>McHale v Watson </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 199</a>; <b><i>Mye v Peters</i></b>

<P>

21   	In the present case the plaintiff was 13 years old, he had
lived in Werris Creek, a railway town, virtually all his life and
was familiar
with trains.  He knew they could be "lethal objects", that what he was doing
was wrong and dangerous; and he also knew
that if he was observed by any
responsible adult, he would be chased away.  In these circumstances he must
accept a significant degree
of responsibility for his injuries, and I assess
such responsibility as one third.  The damages will be apportioned
accordingly.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

22   	As already noted, the plaintiff was born on the 3rd of
February 1982 so he was aged 13 years at the time of the accident and
is now
17, going on 18, years.  He has been raised from birth by his grandmother and
since the age of 4 they have lived in the township
of Werris Creek.  He
attended Werris Creek Public School and his secondary schooling was at Quirindi
High School, where in 1995 he
was in Year 8.  He was not a good student and the
only subjects he enjoyed were metal work and agriculture.  Prior to his
accident,
(bearing in mind he was then only 13&#189;) he had in mind that he
wanted to be a mechanic or a welder.  He was however successful
at cricket and
rugby league which he played at school and he also played club rugby league for
Werris Creek in the local junior league.
 Although he was not good at his
studies, he appears to have had no problems either socially or health wise
prior to the accident.
 
<P>

23   	When he slipped off the wagon he fell beside the track, he
felt numbness in his legs, and experienced a lot of pain.  Jarrod
Kirkwood and
Jamie and Garry MacBeath came to him and someone rang the ambulance.  After a
short time, his grandmother and brother
and sister also arrived.  Whilst
waiting for the ambulance he realised he had been seriously injured and felt
very scared.  He was
taken by ambulance to Tamworth Base Hospital, continuing
to suffer pain which felt as though he was being continually stabbed over
and
over again in the one spot with a knife.  
<P>

24   	At the hospital he was found to have suffered a traverse
fracture of the proximal shaft of the left femur whilst the right
leg had
suffered extensive compound comminuted fractures and dislocations.  The left
femoral fracture was treated in traction with
a left tibial Steinman's pin
whilst the right leg was debrided, the fracture of the tibia and fibula were
reduced and the reduction
maintained with an external fixateur and fracture
dislocations of the ankle and foot were reduced and maintained with Kirshner
wires
and a traverse Steinman's pin whilst the wound was loosely closed and
left elevated on a pillow and observations of circulation carried
out.  But
there was a loss of circulation below the levels of the injuries and a gradual
development of dry gangrene, and ultimately
a right below knee amputation was
performed on the 11th of September.  At the same time the left femoral fracture
was treated with
a closed Kuntchner nail and proximally locked.  His reaction
when told that his right leg was to be amputated was that he felt "shattered",
then he was tearful and angry.  He was on extensive pain killers for 3 or 4
days after the surgery but after that the stump area
became very painful.  
<P>

25   	Post-operatively, progress was complicated by a tendency
of the left femoral fracture to externally rotate and a distil locking
screw
was inserted on the 26th of September.  There was delayed wound healing with
the right below knee amputation stump, but he
was able to walk on crutches and
discharged home on the 15th of October, after some 6 weeks in hospital.  Before
leaving hospital
he had some training in the use of an artificial leg which he
found difficult and frustrating.  His grandmother stayed with him the
whole
time he was in hospital to provide moral support and occasionally to get things
for him when the nurses were not available.
 He does not think he would have
coped emotionally if his grandmother had not been there with him.
<P>

26   	When he left hospital he had a temporary prosthesis and
also crutches which he found difficult to manage at home particularly
because
of the steps.  On the 8th of December 1995, some 5 weeks after leaving hospital
he received his first permanent prosthesis
and he had some problems with this,
and required his grandmother to dress it for him, but it increased his
mobility.  
<P>

27   	At the beginning of 1996 he returned to school in Year 9
but found himself further behind with his studies than before because
of the
time he had missed.  He also had difficulty getting up and down the stairs at
school and to and from class and was experiencing
phantom pains.  He
experienced a degree of teasing and name calling from other students, and the
teachers required him to walk to
and from the sports grounds on sport
afternoons, even though he was unable to take part.  He had quite a number of
days absent from
school during that year, a total of 115, mainly on sports days
because rather than watch others play sport he simply did not go or
had his
grandmother pick him up and bring him home, and he also suffered infection and
blisters on the amputation stump.  
<P>

28   	Meanwhile in July 1996, he received a replacement
prosthesis due to the fact that he was growing.  As he was not coping at
school
he decided to leave school at the end of Year 9 in December that year 1996.  In
1997 he did not seek work because he did not
feel he was physically ready for
it.  During that time he started to notice pain on the right side of his lower
back particularly
when lifting things.
<P>

29   	At present he is unable to run and cannot squat or kneel
easily, and if he does so for any time he has pain below his right
knee.  He
also gets pain in the stump if he walks or stands on it for periods of time and
pressure sores on the stump for which he
needs to apply powder and take
antibiotics.  Similarly his left leg aches towards the end of the day, mainly
in the hip area, particularly
if he has done a lot of walking.  He cannot play
any sports, particularly cricket or rugby league, and he misses the latter in
particular.
 He said he is bothered emotionally by having a prosthesis because
people look at it and ask him questions about it and he tends
to wear long
pants whenever possible.  He has not worked in regular employment but he has a
friend who drives a truck and he goes
with him not infrequently; he helps him
with any mechanical breakdowns and can travel in the truck for long periods
without any pain
or other problems.  
<P>

30   	There were no recent medical reports, but in November
1997, Dr Geoffrey P Hibbard, Consultant Physician, reported that examination
of
the left leg appeared completely normal and there appeared to be full range of
movement of the right knee with the prosthesis,
and apart from scars on the
left thigh there was no other clinical abnormality detected but he noted
continuing phantom pains and
periods of depression and irritability due to the
frustration involved with the loss of the lower leg and the severe restriction
on walking and leisure pursuits.  He considered these complications were most
likely permanent and irreversible.  
<P>

31   	At about the same time Peter Briggs, Clinical
Psychologist, noted that he was able to wear shorts and attend the local
swimming
pool without undue embarrassment and, although he had been depressed
in the early stages, he reported that he no longer felt tearful
and depressed
but was continuing to have problems with anger.  He found no continuing signs
of significant depression or anxiety
but emphasised that the plaintiff
nevertheless had significant adjustment problems which will be more emotionally
impactful at different
times in his future life together with increased
problems with pain and discomfort which are likely to increase his emotional
reaction.
 
<P>

32   	I assess the plaintiff's general damages for pain and
suffering, loss of amenities, loss of interference with leisure activities
and
loss of enjoyment of life at $160,000 of which I attribute $60,000 to the past,
and I allow interest on this latter amount at
4&#188; years at 2%, namely
$5,100.
<P>

33   	Out-of-pocket expenses to date are agreed at $32,357 and
in respect of future out- of-pocket expenses there is agreement for
the cost of
renewal of the prosthesis of $109,573.  There is a claim for Tegretol and
powder for application to the stump which together
total $12.50 per week.  This
amount does not seem to be seriously in dispute and, having regard to the
plaintiff's expectation of
life, namely 63 years, I allow $12.50 per week at 3%
for 63 years, namely, $18,639.  A claim is also made for regular visits to a
general practitioner, the plaintiff claiming that these should be allowed at 26
visits a year or once a fortnight, whilst the defendant
submits that 6 times a
year would be more reasonable.  At present the plaintiff attends because of
pressure sores on the stump and
all the general practitioner can do in this
regard is prescribe pain killers and antibiotics.  The pressure sores are more
likely
to be removed by adjustments to the prosthesis, which is already taken
care of in the allowance for visits to the prosthetist.  In
my opinion, 6
visits a year appears to be a reasonable allowance for visits to the general
practitioner.  I really cannot see any
possibility of him continuing to go to a
general practitioner on account of his stump every fortnight for the next 63
years.  Accordingly
I allow 6 visits a year at the agreed rate of $38.50 per
visit for 63 years, $6,624.  These three items of prothesis, pharmaceuticals
and general practitioner total $134,836 and I allow such amount for future
out-of-pocket expenses.  There is also a claim for the
possibility of the need
for future psychological counselling, but in my view the evidence on this issue
is too vague to justify allowing
anything for this item.  
<P>

34   	The plaintiff left school at the end of 1996 and made no
effort to seek work until 1998.  At the beginning of that year he
registered
with Job Network and subsequently applied for work at Woolworths and Kay's
Meats in Tamworth.  Neither organisation had
advertised that they had any job
vacancies and he simply walked in and applied for employment.  Both
applications were unsuccessful.
 Subsequently in August 1999 he applied for a
position which was advertised at Paiada Pty Ltd as a chicken catcher; again
this application
was unsuccessful and he remains unemployed. 
<P>

35   	The plaintiff has grown up in a small country town.  He
was not performing well academically at school before his accident
and the IQ
testing places him towards the lower end of the community.  As a 13 year old
before the accident he had some ideas that
he might like to become a mechanic
or a welder and he liked doing things with his hands, but whilst he might have
gone on to become
a mechanic or a welder, I find that he more likely would have
become an unskilled labourer probably working on farms, or for a local
government authority and he may have suffered significant periods of
unemployment.  
<P>

36   	He has been assessed (Ex. 6) as having the physical and
intellectual capacity for a number of occupations notwithstanding
his injury,
and his evidence is that after the case is over his first priority will be to
endeavour to find employment.  He has been
travelling on a truck with a friend
of his not for wages but for something to do, and is able to travel lengthy
distances seated
in the truck without any particular discomfort.  He is
apparently able to change a tyre but suffered pain after doing so.  
<P>

37   	Notwithstanding the loss of his right leg below the knee,
I am satisfied that he does have a capacity for gainful employment
but he will
be unfit for work involving bending, squatting, climbing ladders or work that
requires him to spend a large part of the
day on his feet.  Whereas he could
formerly have worked as a farm hand, builder's labourer, construction worker or
such like, I consider
that he is now most likely to be employable as a process
worker, such as in a fruit and vegetable factory.  Some of the other vocations
said to be suitable to him would not readily be available in the Tamworth,
Werris Creek area.  He has observed his friends working
as welders and feels
that that would be beyond his capacity because of the bending and twisting
involved.  Moreover, he can expect
longer periods of unemployment than if he
had not lost his leg.  Agreed weekly award wage rates were produced, including
farm hand
- $353.10 net per week, builder's labourer - $379.28 net per week,
cleaner - $394.45 net per week and construction worker - $433.45
net per week,
welder - $353.85 to $388.45 net per week, whereas the award wage for a fruit
and vegetable factory hand under the Food
Preservers (State) Award for an adult
is $301.40 per week net.  Using these figures merely as a guide and having
regard to the factors
to which I have referred including the reduced employment
opportunities in country areas and the plaintiff's lack of education I
assess
his loss of earning capacity at $130 per week net.  No claim is made for loss
of earnings to date but for the future I allow
to age 65, 47 years at $130 per
week at 3% p.a. less 15% for vicissitudes, namely $146, 447.
<P>

38   	In respect of the claim for loss of superannuation
benefits, no precise figures are available, but I have done some rough
calculations based on a gross weekly wage loss of $150 along the lines
suggested by counsel, and on this basis I allow $19,000.
<P>

39   	There is also a claim for unpaid domestic assistance, past
and future.  During the 6 weeks that the plaintiff was in hospital
his
grandmother stayed at the hospital and provided him with emotional support.
She also fetched things for him when the nurses were
not around and he was
reluctant to call them.  Whilst it was undoubtedly beneficial to have her
provide the emotional support which
she did, this is not, as I see it, a type
of service or domestic assistance which can be the subject of a claim for
damages, because
it is not the type of service which could have been purchased
at a price from someone else if not provided by the grandmother, as
it was only
on account of her relationship with him that she was able to provide this
emotional support.  I therefore allow nothing
for the period whilst he was in
hospital.  
<P>

40   	Following his discharge from hospital and for a period of
about 6 months thereafter whilst he was on his temporary prosthesis
and
initially on his first permanent prosthesis, and whilst he still had a pin in
his left femur, the plaintiff needed a considerable
degree of assistance around
the house and in his ordinary everyday living, including getting him in and out
of the shower, preparing
his clothes and his prosthesis, fetching things for
him around the home and such like.  During this time he also had a number of
blisters on the stump and these required treatment and dressing.  In respect of
this period I allow 3 hours per day at the agreed
rate of $18.75 per hour, i.e.
$56.25 per day or $393.75 per week for 26 weeks = $10,237.  Since then she has
on occasions rendered
him assistance such as dressing blisters on the stump
when he has had them and matters of that nature but this is intermittent and
irregular and she also does some other things for him like preparing his
prosthesis each evening and making him a sandwich before
she goes to bed, but
these are matters which, on the plaintiff's own admission, he could easily do
for himself.  In respect of the
period, from 6 months after he came out of
hospital and for the future I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has any valid
claim
for further domestic assistance.  He is however entitled to interest on
the amount of $10,237:  <b><i>Arvind &amp; Kundo v Greco</i></b> (unreported -
Court of Appeal - 24 July 1995).  It is in respect of a closed period, and so I
allow interest on that sum at 10% for
3 years 9 months, total $3,839.
<P>

41   	The various heads of damages may therefore be summarised
as follows:
<P>

General damages		$160,000
<P>

Interest on past general damages		5,100
<P>

Out-of-pocket expenses to date		32,357
<P>

Future out of pocket expenses		134,836
<P>

Loss of future earning capacity		146,447
<P>

Loss of future superannuation benefits		19,000
<P>

Loss of domestic services		10,237
<P>

Interest thereon		<u>3,839</u>
<P>

		<u>$511,816</u>
<P>

After allowing an one third apportionment on account of the plaintiff's
contributory negligence, these damages are reduced to $341,210.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

42   	I direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff in the
sum of $341,210 and order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs
of the
proceedings.
<P>

43   	Having regard to the fact that the plaintiff will turn 18
in approximately 6 weeks time, and it would be undesirable to incur
the charges
involved in paying the money to the Public Trustee and then having it paid out
again to the plaintiff, so shortly, I
am prepared to accede to the request made
by Senior Counsel for the plaintiff and so I order that the amount of the
judgment be paid
into Court and thence to the plaintiff's solicitors on an
undertaking from a partner of that firm to pay the outstanding medical
expenses, a sum of $600 per month to the plaintiff until his 18th birthday and
the balance to be held as controlled money in an interest
bearing deposit
without charge to the plaintiff other than bank fees until he turns 18 years,
whereupon it is to be paid to the plaintiff.
