<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

                            
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  On 8 September 1999 the prisoner, Son
Thai Tran, was arraigned upon an indictment charging him with two counts:  (i)
the murder
of Sanh Thi Nguyen at Yagoona on 21 April 1998 and (ii) the
malicious wounding of Minh Trang Pham on the same date.  He entered pleas
of
not guilty to both counts and a jury was duly empanelled.  On 29 September 1999
the jury returned verdicts convicting the prisoner
of manslaughter on the first
count and of the offence charged in the second count.
<P>

2   	At about 5 am on 21 April 1998 the prisoner broke into the
home of his estranged wife, Minh Tran Pham, at unit 2/123 Dutton
Street,
Yagoona.  He smashed the window to the main bedroom where his wife,
mother-in-law and son were sleeping. At the time his
mother-in-law, the
deceased, was attempting to make contact with the police by telephone.  The
prisoner took hold of the telephone.
 The deceased ran from the room. Shortly
thereafter the prisoner followed her into the hallway of the house and stabbed
her repeatedly
with a broken pair of scissors.  During the course of the
assault upon the deceased the prisoner's wife attempted to intervene. 
In the
course of so doing she sustained a stab wound to the back of her left shoulder.
The deceased managed to walk back to the main
bedroom where she collapsed and
died.
<P>

3   	Following the stabbing the prisoner took his wife and young
son into the bathroom adjacent to the main bedroom.  He bound their
wrists and
ankles.  He tied his wife to the toilet and placed the boy in the shower
recess.  The prisoner put his jacket over the
boy's head to prevent him seeing
the body of the deceased.  After a little time the prisoner untied his wife and
attempted to dress
her wound.  Thereafter he re-tied her wrists.
<P>

4   	He remained in the house for about 12 hours following the
killing.  During this time he was in a state of considerable distress.
 He
appears to have entertained thoughts of killing himself and possibly his wife.
He wrote out a list of his possessions with a
view to giving them to his
son.
<P>

5   	Ultimately, his wife suggested that she would tell the
police that the family had been the victim of a home invasion; intruders
had
broken into the house and killed her mother.  She suggested that the prisoner
might obliterate the traces of his presence by
wiping surfaces to remove
fingerprints.  He did this and in the late afternoon of 21 April he left the
home.
<P>

6   	The wife and son broke free of their restraints and sought
assistance from neighbours.
<P>

7   	The wife was admitted to Bankstown Hospital for treatment
for her injuries.  She initially gave the investigating police an
account that
three men had invaded the home and stabbed her mother.
<P>

8   	On 23 April 1998 Mrs Pham supplied the police with a
statement nominating her husband as the killer.  The prisoner was arrested
on
that day and agreed to be interviewed by the police.  In the course of that
interview the prisoner denied knowledge of the killing
of his mother-in-law and
supplied an alibi.  It is to be noted that the prisoner had made no attempt to
persuade any person to support
him in his alibi.  It was easily disproved.
<P>

9   	The deceased sustained twenty-five wounds to her body. Of
these four were potentially lethal.
<P>

10   	The prisoner had consumed a substantial quantity of full
strength beer prior to attending at the Dutton Street premises in
the early
hours of the morning of 21 April. Intoxication as bearing on the formation of
the intent for murder was left to the jury.
 Provocation and the partial
defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind were also left.  Mr
Ierace SC, who appears
for the prisoner, submits that I would sentence the
prisoner upon the basis that his partial defence of substantial impairment was
made out.  The Crown agrees, having regard to the way the evidence unfolded,
that this is the appropriate course.  I consider it
is.
<P>

11   	Before turning to the medical evidence bearing on the
prisoner's mental state at the time of the killing, it is appropriate
to refer
to the facts of this somewhat unusual case in a little more detail.
<P>

12   	The prisoner was born in South Vietnam.  He is aged 37
years.  He was 14 years old when the government of North Vietnam came
to power
in South Vietnam.  After he left school, in 1979, he was placed in a labour
camp.  He remained in that camp for more than
five years.  During this period
of imprisonment he made an escape attempt.  He was caught and placed in
solitary confinement where
he was kept for a number of months in a darkened
room with his legs chained.
<P>

13   	The prisoner was released from the labour camp around 1984
or 85.  While he was at liberty he met and married his wife, Minh
Tran Pham.
She was then aged 19.  Following his marriage the prisoner was re-arrested
after an unsuccessful attempt to leave Vietnam.
 He spent a further year in
custody on this occasion.  His wife was pregnant with their child.
<P>

14   	Following the prisoner's release from custody on this
second occasion, he and his wife and child escaped from Vietnam on a
refugee
boat.  They ultimately landed in Indonesia where they were detained in an
immigration camp.  The conditions were described
as being very poor.  The
family remained in that camp for five years.  At the end of that period they
were repatriated to Vietnam.
 Mrs Pham gave evidence at the trial that she and
the prisoner had formed a strong relationship through the hard years.
<P>

15   	A year after the family returned to Vietnam they were
sponsored to come to Australia by the prisoner's family. They arrived
in
Australia on 13 November 1996.  Initially  they lived in Melbourne with the
prisoner's family.  After about three months Mrs Pham
and their son, Tu Tai
Tran, left the prisoner and moved to Sydney.  At the time of that move Mrs Pham
had it in mind to separate
from her husband.  She and the child lived for a
time with some relatives at Bonnyrigg.  After ten days the prisoner joined them
in Sydney.  They reconciled and thereafter lived together as a family in
Sydney.  They moved to premises at 45 Harrington Street,
Cabramatta.  The
prisoner obtained employment with Minh Diep Doan, a clothing manufacturer.  He
worked on a steam press ironing garments.
 Both the prisoner and his wife made
up garments for Mr Doan at home on a piecework basis. They were a hard-working
couple.
<P>

16   	In late 1997 the prisoner and his wife arranged for her
mother, the deceased, to come to Australia from Vietnam.
<P>

17   	The deceased arrived in Australia around November 1997.
She moved into the home at 45 Harrington Street, Cabramatta.
<P>

18   	Mr Doan closed his factory for the Christmas holiday
break.  At this time the prisoner went to Melbourne to see his mother.
 While
he was away a male boarder, Vanny So, moved into the Harrington Street
premises.  It is clear that Mr So's presence became
a source of tension when
the prisoner returned.  It also appears that the deceased started, for whatever
reason, to actively subvert
the marriage.
<P>

19   	There was evidence of a statement made to police by a
woman named Hoang Hoa Pham who appears to have been on friendly terms
with the
deceased.  On her account the deceased had complained that the prisoner did not
buy her anything while the boarder, Vanny
So, showered her with gifts.  Ms
Hoang Pham told the police, "The boarder openly took Trang and her mother out
from time to time
without any regard for Trang's husband".
<P>

20   	About two months after the deceased arrived in Australia
Mrs Pham separated from the prisoner.  This was around February 1998.
 The
prisoner moved out of home and stayed with a friend in Canley Vale.
<P>

21   	Mrs Pham gave evidence that after the separation at night
when her son and mother were in bed she would steal away from the
home to meet
her husband whom she still loved. Her husband would come to the Harrington
Street house every day.  On occasions he
slept outside the home.  She described
the prisoner as repeatedly telling her that he loved her very much and was not
able to live
without her.  Mrs Pham felt torn between her loyalty to her
husband and her loyalty to her mother.  She told her husband to stay
where he
was for the time being and that when her mother returned to Vietnam he could
move into the home.  In the course of giving
evidence-in-chief Mrs Pham
proclaimed, "My husband is the only man that I love".
<P>

22   	It was Mrs Pham's evidence that on occasions when her
husband would call to see her at the Harrington Street premises her
mother
would contact the police.  The mother intercepted the prisoner's telephone
calls to her.
<P>

23   	On two occasions when the prisoner called to see his wife
he was assaulted by the deceased.  On one occasion she struck him
with a hammer
and on another occasion with the flat side of a meat cleaver.
<P>

24   	At her mother's prompting Mrs Pham agreed to move from
the Harrington Street premises.  This appears to have been done with
a view to
breaking off contact with the prisoner. After they relocated to a townhouse in
Dutton Street the deceased moved into the
main bedroom with her daughter. Mrs
Pham explained:  "She moved to my bedroom and we stayed in one bedroom and I
could not go out
to meet my husband any more".
<P>

25   	The deceased persuaded her daughter to apply for an
apprehended violence order to prevent the prisoner calling to the home.
 Mrs
Pham described her predicament in this way:
<P>

"My mum told me to go to court to apply for the apprehended violence order so
my husband would not be able to come to see me any
more.  I loved my mother but
I also loved my husband and I was in the middle of two of them, but I loved my
mother and I listened
to her.  Wherever she told me to go I would go."
<P>

 
<P>

26   	On Friday, 17 April 1998 Mrs Pham obtained an apprehended
violence order from the Local Court at Fairfield.  After taking
out the order,
and before the mother's death a matter of days later, it appears that Mrs Pham
again initiated contact with the prisoner.
<P>

27   	Following the move to Dutton Street it also appears that
Vanny So was a regular visitor.
<P>

28   	On the night prior to the killing the prisoner went to the
townhouse and stood outside.  He overheard a telephone conversation
between his
wife and a friend.  In that conversation he learned that his wife had been
taken by Vanny So to Parramatta to file for
a divorce.  From things Mrs Pham
said to her friend Mrs Nga in the course of that telephone call, the prisoner
inferred that she
had formed an intimate relationship with Vanny So.  He left
the premises and returned to the home of a friend where he consumed some
alcohol.
<P>

29   	There was a body of evidence tending to establish that in
the period following his separation from his wife the prisoner had
been
depressed.  In the past he had been a hard-working man interested in earning
money.  After the separation he became uninterested
in work and his output at
the factory dropped markedly.
<P>

30   	I accept that the prisoner loved his wife and child and
was devastated by the loss of them.
<P>

31   	In the period immediately prior to the killing the
prisoner had been living at Mr Doan's house.  In early April Mr Doan left
to
return to Vietnam in order to marry.  This left the prisoner even more isolated
and conscious of his loss.
<P>

32   	The prisoner described his response to hearing his wife's
telephone conversation with Mrs Nga in this way:
<P>

 "I just felt that I fell off from the sky to a very deep pit.  I was
agonising."
<P>

 
<P>

33   	After consuming more alcohol at the home of his friend Mr
Lee and elsewhere the prisoner returned to the Dutton Street premises
in the
early hours of the morning of Tuesday, 21 April 1998.  The prisoner gained
entry to the garage of  the premises.  It was his
evidence, which I accept,
that he tapped on the internal wall between the garage and the main bedroom in
the hope of waking his wife.
 He wanted to talk to her before he either left
Sydney and returned to his family in Melbourne or killed himself.  I accept
that
was his reason for returning to the Dutton Street premises.
<P>

34   	The Crown advanced its case upon the basis that the
prisoner had become enraged with the deceased and that he went to the
Dutton
Street premises that morning carrying the broken pair of scissors in order to
kill her.  I do not accept that view of the
facts as established beyond
reasonable doubt.  Indeed, I do not consider it a probable view of the facts.
It was clear that whilst
in the garage of the premises the prisoner had free
access through an open interconnecting door to the premises.  The evidence
showed
that the deceased got up while the prisoner was in the garage and that
he, having been disturbed, left the premises.  The deceased
was suspicious that
someone was outside the premises.  She picked up the phone by the window of the
main bedroom to make contact
with the police.  It was at this time, when I
accept that the prisoner had resolved to leave the premises, that he broke
through
the window and grabbed the phone from his mother-in-law.
<P>

35   	Thereafter it was the prisoner's account that he ran into
the hallway of the house in an attempt to persuade the mother-in-law
not to
raise the alarm.  He was in breach of the apprehended violence order by his
presence at the premises and knew that he would
be in trouble if the police
were called.  He said that in the darkened hallway of the home the deceased had
struck him with something
which he subsequently realised to be the broken pair
of scissors.  He had taken hold of the scissors and did not remember the
killing.
<P>

36   	Medical evidence, both called in the defence and the Crown
case, was to the effect that people involved in highly emotional
and violent
incidents of this type not uncommonly suffer amnesia for some or all of the
incident.  I accept, on balance, that the
prisoner does not recall the detail
of the killing.
<P>

37   	As I have already indicated, I do not find that the
prisoner came to the premises armed with the pair of broken scissors.
<P>

38   	A week after the killing Mrs Pham disposed of a broken set
of scissors which was recovered from the garbage bin by police.
 She was
examined about this in some detail at the trial although it was not suggested
that this was the weapon used to kill the
deceased.  I found her answers
perplexing and I did not consider she was being completely frank in this
portion of her evidence.
 When questioned about the instances involving her
mother's assaults upon the prisoner both with the hammer and the meat clever,
Mrs Pham's evidence was also somewhat unconvincing.  In each instance she
seemed to me to be concerned, as best she could, to protect
her mother's
memory.
<P>

39   	Mr Ierace invites me to find as a fact for the purpose of
sentence that the deceased was the one armed with the broken scissor
and that
she struck him with it precipitating the attack.  This was the accused's
account in his evidence.  It was not consistent
with his wife's version of the
fatal attack.  I have not found it easy to determine this factual issue.  Mrs
Pham was tested at some
length at trial as to whether she had been present in
the hall throughout the incident.  She was emphatic that she had been.  On
her
account, although she had not seen the scissors until the three of them were
back in the bedroom, she saw nothing to suggest
that it was the mother who had
first struck the prisoner.  However, as I have indicated, I consider that Mrs
Pham may be at pains
to show respect for her mother's memory.  I have regard to
the fact that on two previous occasions the deceased had attacked the
prisoner
with a weapon when he came to the house.  On balance I accept that it was she
who first took up the scissors on this occasion.
<P>

40   	Dr Lucas gave evidence that the prisoner was suffering
from a major depressive episode of considerable severity at the time
of the
killing.  He described the events preceding the killing as major psychosocial
stressors.
<P>

41   	Dr Carne gave evidence that the prisoner's depression,
growing out of his belief that his wife was having an affair with another
man
and that his mother-in-law was conspiring in the breakdown of his marriage, led
him to become profoundly depressed.
<P>

42   	Dr Wong, who was called by the Crown in a case in reply,
was of the view that there were undoubtedly stressful life circumstances
prior
to the killing which were capable of resulting in a severe depression.  The
prisoner's account given to him, and to the other
psychiatrists who interviewed
him, described symptoms indicative of a severe depression. Dr Wong was not
disposed to accept that
the prisoner's account of his symptoms was reliable.
To my mind the evidence of the prisoner's wife, Mr Doan and others was strongly
supportive of the prisoner's account of his symptoms.  Once one accepted the
reliability of the prisoner's account in this regard
I did not consider Dr Wong
to be greatly at odds with either Dr Carne or Dr Lucas.
<P>

43   	As I have already indicated I approach the matter of
sentence upon an acceptance that the prisoner's culpability was reduced
to
manslaughter by reason of his substantial impairment arising out of his mental
condition.  In a case where a verdict of manslaughter
is returned on the ground
of substantial impairment (formerly the partial defence of diminished
responsibility) it will frequently
be appropriate for the court to have regard
to the risk that the prisoner's mental abnormality may lead him to kill again.
In such
cases considerations of the protection of society will be to the fore
in the exercise of the sentencing discretion: <b>Veen v The Queen (No 2)</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 465</a> at 476-477.  The Crown supplied me with a schedule setting
out details of a number of sentences imposed on persons convicted of
manslaughter
on the basis of diminished responsibility in the period 1991 to
1995.  In the majority of the cases set out in that schedule real
concerns were
raised as to the protection of society. That is not a consideration which to my
mind is raised by the evidence in this
case.
<P>

44   	The prisoner was subject to a remarkable combination of
stressors in the period leading up to the killing.  I do not find
the evidence
of any of the psychiatrists who were called at the trial to support a view that
the prisoner's mental condition is such
as to carry with it an appreciable risk
that he would offend again in the future.
<P>

45   	The prisoner is a person of good character.  He has had a
sad and difficult life.  He maintained a stable relationship with
his wife
until shortly before the tragic event.  He appears to be a loving father who
sincerely cares for his son.   Minh Trang Pham
gave evidence at the sentence
hearing.  Following the death of her mother she had proceeded with her
application for a divorce. 
It should be noted that the application was
commenced at the mother's prompting prior to the killing.  Mrs Pham has visited
the prisoner
during the trial.  She has taken her son to see him.  He has been
in custody since his arrest on 23 April 1998.  It is Mrs Pham's
evidence that
she will continue to see the prisoner following his release.
<P>

46   	I consider the prisoner has good prospects of
rehabilitation.  While in custody he has undertaken adult education,
successfully
completing a reading and writing course.  At the time of his
incarceration his English was very limited.  He is presently working
at the
Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre in Cortex 1 (Textile Industries).  He
has been made what is described as an essential
worker due to the competence he
demonstrated as a quality control supervisor.  He is currently undertaking an
after-hours textile
course in clothing production.  He is performing to the
satisfaction of his teachers.  Generally he is described by the Manager of
Employment and Centre Services for the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre
as "an excellent worker who performs his duties well".
<P>

47   	In the light of Mrs Pham's evidence to which I have made
reference I think the likelihood is that the prisoner will ultimately
resume
his family life upon release.  However, this will not be an easy transition
given all that has happened.
<P>

48   	I accept that the killing of the deceased occurred at a
time when, by reason of his major depressive condition, the prisoner's
ability
to control himself was substantially impaired.  I accept that he has no
recollection of the frenzied attack himself.  I accept
that he has suffered
real remorse.  During the course of the trial the prisoner broke down both when
his wife was describing the
killing and in the course of his own evidence of
the events leading up to it. His distress was evident.
<P>

49   	The prisoner has mounted a powerful subjective case.  It
is appropriate that I mitigate the sentence to take account of these
matters.
<P>

50   	In the light of the acceptance that the prisoner's
culpability for this crime was significantly reduced by reason of his mental
condition Mr Ierace submitted that I would place relatively little emphasis on
considerations of general deterrence: <b> Regina v Anderson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1981/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] VicRp 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20VR%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] VR 155.</a>
In <b>Regina v Letteri</b> (unreported, NSW CCA, 18 March 1992) the authorities
were summarised thus:
<P>

"The principle then is clear enough.  It is correctly stated  as follows - that
whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration
in every sentencing
exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the
case of an offender suffering from
a mental disorder or severe intellectual
handicap.  In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may
produce the
result that considerations of general deterrence are totally
outweighed by other factors.  In every case it is a matter of balancing
the
relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every
sentencing exercise."
<P>

 
<P>

51   	I accept in the light of the evidence of the prisoner's
impairment flowing from the major depressive episode that general
deterrence
should not have the weight which would otherwise be called for.  
<P>

52   	The sentence must nonetheless reflect that the unlawful
take of a human life is always viewed as a serious matter: <b> Regina v
Macdonald</b> (unreported, NSW CCA, 12 December 1995).
<P>

53   	The malicious wounding of Minh Trang Pham was occasioned
in the course of the attack upon the deceased.  It is appropriate
that the
sentence that I impose in relation to that matter be concurrent with the
sentence in respect of the manslaughter.
<P>

54   	The prisoner had not lived for long in this country at the
time of the commission of this offence.  He had relatively few
social supports
available to him.  He has suffered from major depression while in custody and
entertained thoughts of suicide.  Although
he has made commendable efforts
while in custody in terms of both education and employment, I consider that his
readjustment into
society at the completion of the custodial portion of his
sentence may be difficult and that he will benefit from supervision for
a
relatively lengthy period.  These considerations in my view constitute special
circumstances within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sa1989121/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> 1989</A>
and make it appropriate that I impose an additional term that exceeds one-third
of the minimum term.
<P>

55   	The pressures to which the prisoner was subject in the
weeks prior to the killing while he was in the throes of depression
were
remarkable and have led me to the view that the sentences in respect of both
matters should reflect a substantial measure of
leniency.
<P>

56   	In sentencing the prisoner in respect of the charge of
manslaughter I am asked to take into account the offence of contravening
the
apprehended violence order which was imposed by the Fairfield Court on 17 April
1998 and breached by the prisoner attending at
the Dutton Street premises on 19
April 1998.  This offence is recorded on a Form 1 pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 21</a> of the<b>
<A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act</a></b> 1986</A>.  I take this matter into account.  In the
light of the wife's evidence that she procured the issue of the order to
appease her mother
while continuing herself to seek out her husband, I do not
propose attaching the weight to this offence that the breach of a protective
court order would ordinarily attract.
<P>

57   	Son Thai Tran, in relation to the conviction for
manslaughter of Sanh Thi Nguyen I sentence you to a minimum term of three
years
and six months penal servitude to commence on 23 April 1998 and to expire on 22
October 2001.  I specify an additional term
of two years and six months to
commence on 23 October 2001 and to expire on 22 April 2004.
<P>

58   	In relation to the conviction upon the charge of malicious
wounding I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve
months
backdated to 23 April 1998. Accordingly, that sentence expired on 22 April
1999.
<P>
