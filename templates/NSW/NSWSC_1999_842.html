070077/98	<b>REGINA   v   ANTHONY LLOYD SIMPSON</b>
<P>

SENTENCE
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner, Anthony Lloyd Simpson, is convicted of
the manslaughter of Michael John Priest.  The prisoner pleaded
not guilty to
murder but guilty to manslaughter upon arraignment before Mr Justice Barr on 25
May 1999.  The Crown accepted the plea
in full satisfaction of the charge in
the indictment and the prisoner was remanded for sentence in Newcastle on 5
July 1999.  Because
a trial was to commence on that date, I further remanded
the prisoner until 9 July when he adhered to the plea previously entered.
 I
heard evidence and submissions on 9 July and then remanded the prisoner in
custody for sentence.
<P>

2  	The death as a consequence of which the subject charge arose
occurred on 12 March 1998 in the backyard of premises at Tarean
Road, Karuah.
Those premises comprise a dwelling house, and before he separated from his wife
some months prior to 12 March 1998
the prisoner lived there with his wife and
children.  Indeed, even following the separation, it seems that the prisoner
remained
on good terms with his wife and used to visit her frequently at the
former matrimonial home.  As a matter of daily routine, he used
to go there to
see the children off to school.  However, following the separation the prisoner
lived with his mother whose home was
a short distance away at Franklin Street,
Karuah.
<P>

3  	The prisoner had growing in the back garden of the former
matrimonial home some marijuana plants.  In order to protect these
plants from
being stolen or damaged by animals, the prisoner put up chicken wire fencing
and he also put in place electrified wiring
which calls for a detailed
description.
<P>

4  	The plants were growing in a bed near the back fence.  That fence
was of corrugated iron construction and there was a timber
cap along the top of
the iron.  Behind that fence was vacant land, and immediately behind that fence
was a further fence comprising
four strands of barbed wire fed through upright
timber posts.  The other three sides of the bed in which the plants were
growing
were fenced with chicken wire which the prisoner introduced to about
waist height.  The prisoner also put in place a chicken wire
roof supported on
posts, with a gap between the vertically positioned chicken wire and the
horizontally positioned chicken wire of
about thirty centimetres.  The prisoner
secured a coaxial cable to the capping on the back fence by nailing it down.
The protective
covering on that cable was removed by the prisoner at intervals
of approximately six centimetres along its length on the top of the
timber cap.
That cable was energised by means of an extension lead that ran from a power
point within the house across to a shed
near the garden bed in question.  A
sheathed two core cable was joined to the end of the extension lead and this
joined cable extended
from the garden shed across to a star picket support for
the chicken wire fence.  It was secured to that picket and stretched from
there
across to the iron fence cap where there was a T junction and it then stretched
in each direction along the fence cap.  The
cable from the shed was not fully
insulated.  There were two breaks in the insulation where there were joins and
the wire was exposed
at each of these joins for some five to ten millimetres.
This cable from the shed ran midway along the gap between the horizontally
erected chicken wire and the vertically erected chicken wire, stretching from
the star picket support to the corrugated fence boundary.
 The 240 volt power
supply from the house was produced simply by plugging in the lead in the house
and activating the switch.
<P>

5  	The horizontally placed chicken wire was only introduced shortly
before March 1998 but the remainder of the system described
had by then already
been in place for some three years.
<P>

6  	It seems that under cover of darkness early on the morning of 12
March 1998, the deceased entered the backyard of the premises
in which the
cannabis plants were growing.  It would appear that the deceased had travelled
to Karuah with some friends and he entered
the backyard by stealth for the
specific purpose of taking the plants.  Tragically, in the course of his
endeavours to remove the
marijuana plants, he was electrocuted.
<P>

7  	The deceased, of course, had no right to enter onto this property
where he met his death, and he went there for an unlawful
purpose.  However,
those circumstances afford the prisoner no defence, as he has acknowledged by
his plea.
<P>

8  	The prisoner gave evidence, which I accept, that he found the
deceased in an upright position with his face on the horizontally
located
chicken wire.  Having considered the report and evidence from Mr Laurence, an
electrical inspector for Energy Australia,
and having also considered the post
mortem report of Dr Botterill, I find beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased
died from electrocution
and that he was electrocuted as a consequence of
contact with an exposed part of the wiring that stretched within the gap in the
chicken wire such as I have described.
<P>

9  	The deceased's friends waited for him to return to the car for
some time but eventually left the area unaware that the deceased
had been
electrocuted.  The prisoner discovered the body when he entered the backyard
after daylight on 12 March 1998, and having
discovered the body in the position
he described, he panicked and resolved to dispose of it.  The prisoner wrapped
the body in a
quilt and carried it in his motor vehicle to bushland in the Swan
Bay area where he dumped it.
<P>

10  	The deceased's friends returned to the area of Karuah looking
for him and on 13 March, in the belief that he may have been
captured and held,
these friends vigorously questioned the occupant of a house near that owned by
the prisoner and his wife.  This
prompted that occupant to ring the police.
Shortly after a police officer arrived the prisoner, who presumably saw the
police officer
nearby, made a request to that officer that he interview the
prisoner.  Subsequently the prisoner confessed to having found the deceased
near his plants and explained that he panicked and took the body to the Swan
Bay area.  The prisoner later took police to that area
and the body was
recovered.  The prisoner also showed the police where the plants had been
growing in the backyard and the area where
the wiring system had been placed.
Following discovery of the body of the deceased, the prisoner had dismantled
the wiring system
but he later co-operated with Mr Laurence from Energy
Australia in describing how the system had operated.
<P>

11  	The acceptance by the Crown of the plea of guilty to
manslaughter acknowledges that the prisoner did not intend to cause the
death
of the deceased nor did he intend to cause him grievous bodily harm.  It
acknowledges further that the prisoner had not acted
with reckless indifference
to human life.  The prisoner is not to be punished as though any of those
elements, were present.  Nevertheless,
the prisoner has caused a death and has
caused that death in circumstances which demand close attention and
assessment.
<P>

12  	For conduct to constitute manslaughter by criminal negligence,
it must fall so short of the standard of reasonable care relevant
to the
circumstances, and involve such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm
will follow, that it merits criminal punishment:
 see <i>Nydam v The Queen
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1977/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] VicRp 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20VR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) VR 430</a> at 445 and <i>Wilson v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d92%29%20174%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-92) 174 CLR 313</a> at
333.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner's conduct in
putting in place the wiring system described, and
in employing the 240 volt
power supply source in the manner described, amounted to criminal negligence.
Indeed, the prisoner by his
plea has acknowledged as much.
<P>

13  	In assessing the gravity of what the prisoner did I have been
greatly assisted by the evidence given by Mr Laurence.  Mr Laurence
was in
Court when the prisoner gave evidence describing the relevant electrical
system.  Mr Laurence said that the description given
by the prisoner in
evidence was very much as the prisoner had described it to Mr Laurence when he
attended the scene of the fatal
event for the purpose of preparing his report
of 1 April 1998.  Mr Laurence gave the following evidence (transcript p 50-51),
assessing
the system which the prisoner had put in place:
<P>

<i>"Q.	What do you say about that particular portion of the apparatus, the
wiring, the exposed area running across the top of that fence...</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Potentially very, very dangerous.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Why is that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, it is open to a fatality, just by exposing that attached cable, and
earthing out with the knees or feet, it can be very fatal.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that earthing it would be caused I suppose by a person not only going
in by trying to get over the fence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But trying to go out that way too?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, certainly.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In relation to the situation of the wire meshing roofing--</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The three or two side wire mesh fences and the wire mesh fence at the
front, with this cable, for want of a better description,
running through, with
the two exposed joins, as I understand the prisoner's description, at mid point
a 30 millimetre gap between
the height of the wire fencing and the height of
the roofing--</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What do you say about that, the danger that it represents?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, the same as the wire on the back fence; it is open up to a
fatality.</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  Q.  What did you say, Mr Lawrence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is very, very dangerous and open up to a fatality.</i>
<P>

<i>BARNETT:  Q.  And if one was standing on the earth and just accidentally put
one's hand around that exposed area of wiring, what would
be the effect?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, it would be a fatality.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Just in relation to and only going to the potentiality of the danger in
the overall situation, the wood across the top of the back
fence, would that
provide a degree of insulation between the metal fence and the exposed
wires?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Depending on the weather, whether it had been raining or not, but yes,
quite a degree of insulation, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But once the wood was moist--</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Moist, a different matter.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is that because the moisture itself is a conductor?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is right, yes."</i>
<P>

14  	I accept the evidence of Mr Laurence as set out above.
<P>

15  	As a qualified electrician, and as the person who set up this
offending system, the prisoner ought to have appreciated the
dangers identified
by Mr Laurence.  Indeed, he expressly acknowledged in cross examination an
awareness of the possibility of heart
damage from exposure to an electric
shock:
<P>

<i>"Q.	See, no matter how short a time one receives a shock for, the result is
dependent on that person's physical health, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	One of the things that a shock can do is, amongst other things, it can
just cause a heart attack and kill you, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And your training tells you, you have been warned that can happen very
quickly from an electric shock, haven't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes."</i>
<P>

16  	The prisoner said that the uninsulated section where the
deceased was electrocuted was not uninsulated by design.  Whilst I
have some
reservations about the prisoner's evidence to that effect, I cannot find beyond
reasonable doubt that the lack of insulation
in that section stretching to the
back fence was a deliberate part of the protective system.  Nevertheless, the
danger that that
section presented ought to have been recognised by the
prisoner.  He certainly was aware of the lack of insulation there because
it
was he who tied the uninsulated wires together.  The assertion that he could
not afford a piece of conduit at a cost of $11 I
cannot accept.  The prisoner
had had three years to accumulate the sum of $11 that would have been
sufficient to buy appropriate
conduit at the local hardware store, such as
would have insulated that section.
<P>

17  	The prisoner did give evidence that he did not expect that the
cable extended under the chicken wire roof would be pulled up
or that the wire
roof would be pulled down so as to contact the cable, but in my opinion that
this may occur should have been appreciated
by the prisoner, particularly
considering that he had in contemplation that an intruder may try to steal the
plants growing in the
enclosure.  In his examination in chief, the prisoner
gave the following evidence (Transcript p 31):
<P>

<i>"Q.	With the power on and with the wire connecting the house to the back
fence, would the wire roof of the enclosure have been live?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That was because of the gap between the wire roof and the naked
joins?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And were those naked joins positioned within the enclosure itself, and
not in the ordinary course in contact with the wire perimeter
fence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Now if the power were on and the roof wire were depressed against the
naked wire join, that would render the roof live, would it
not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Or alternatively if somebody had inadvertently, by movement of some part
of their body, caused the naked wire join to lift against
the roof, that would
also render the roof live?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct."</i>
<P>

18  	Later, in cross examination (transcript p 41), the prisoner gave
the following responses to the following questions in point:
<P>

<i>"Q.	What this man seems to have done on your reconstruction, and I am not
criticising you for it, is indeed come into contact with
the wires in some
process of trying to lean in and get at those plants, would you agree with
that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is possible, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Done the very thing that I suggested to you could happen to someone who
had to manipulate the roofing and the front fence to get
at the plants,
correct?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it is possible.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You have, with due respect, drawn a diagram of somebody who is actually
leaning in towards where the plants are, much as I am now?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	With his arms extended forward as one would anticipate someone trying to
pull plants out?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who has, in doing that process, obviously in the dark, pushed - at least
had his head or chin come into contact with the roofing
wire?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And at the same time come into contact with the ground?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And we unfortunately know the result, don't we?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes."</i>
<P>

19  	Having considered the evidence of Mr Laurence and the evidence
of the prisoner, my assessment of the objective features I have
reviewed is
such that I must regard this case as being a very serious case of criminal
negligence.
<P>

20  	This was no transient danger the prisoner had created.  It
existed as part of an installation in place for three years except
for the
chicken wire roof.  The installation had as one of its objectives the
prevention of theft of the crop by unwanted visitors.
 The prisoner knew the
particular area the deceased came in contact with was not insulated, yet he did
nothing to insulate it over
the three year period it had been in place, even
after the recent positioning of the chicken wire roof.  The prisoner is only,
of
course, to be punished for the crime that he committed on 12 March 1998 but
the circumstances in which he had earlier created and
employed this wiring
system are relevant in the assessment of the level of his culpability for this
crime.
<P>

21  	Pursuant to s 21 of the <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>, I have
been asked to take into account a further offence when passing sentence upon
the prisoner, namely the cultivation of the
five cannabis plants grown by him.
I accede to that application and will sentence the prisoner accordingly.
<P>

22  	I turn to the subjective features of this case.
<P>

23  	The prisoner was born on 19 July 1960, so that he is now
thirty-nine years of age.  He is married and his evidence was that
his
separation from his wife is not permanent.  Indeed, the prisoner and his wife
renewed their marriage vows in December 1998. 
There are two children of the
marriage, a twelve year old daughter and an eleven year old son.
<P>

24  	The prisoner's employment record is that he completed his trade
qualification as an electrician in 1989  but in more recent
years prior to the
commission of this crime he was employed as a driver, although he had been
unemployed for six months before March
1998.  He had injured his back working
for Linfox some time ago and a report from Dr Isaacs, orthopaedic surgeon,
recorded that specialist's
assessment of the back injury and has been
considered by me.  More recently the prisoner had been doing casual work as a
driver,
but was hoping to find regular work driving articulated vehicles and
was prepared to go to Oberon to obtain regular employment.
<P>

25  	The prisoner has some criminal record.  He was charged with
supply, possession and smoking Indian hemp in 1979 and the sentence
was
deferred on his entering into a recognizance for three years.  In 1983 he was
given a further recognizance in relation to an
offence of cultivating Indian
hemp.  Later the same year he was fined for receiving and in the following year
was placed upon a further
recognizance for using heroin.  There was a further
fine for receiving in March 1985 and for possession of heroin.  In 1991 he was
fined on a receiving charge, having come before the court on a first instance
warrant.  It may well be, as Mr Rosser submitted, that
the offence for which he
was then fined had been committed years previously.
<P>

26  	The prisoner has abused drugs in the past and was doing so in
the period to which his early criminal history relates.  He used
cannabis and
became involved with heroin in his late teens.  He has been on a methadone
programme, and indeed was successful in the
pursuit of a programme some six or
seven years ago.  After the stress associated with the death of the deceased,
the prisoner lapsed
into heroin use again before seeking help and being placed
on a methadone programme by Dr Martin, from whom a report was tendered
on the
prisoner's behalf.  The prisoner is presently on that methadone programme.
<P>

27  	A pre sentence report dated 1 July 1999 was placed before the
Court.  The probation and parole officer who prepared the report
said, by way
of summary:
<P>

<i>"Variously depicted by others as a man who has not made a significant effort
to use his skills or resources the offender now presents
as a man whose life is
now beyond his control for a number of reasons.  Being charged with the offence
has had a serious impact upon
his mental well being and that of his partner.
Whilst he has sought professional assistance from appropriate agencies he
nevertheless
has reverted to patterns of behaviour characteristic of previous
periods of instability.  If indeed he has only returned to the use
of illegal
addictive and legal substances in more recent times it has exacerbated the
level of instability in his life and it would
seem to have reduced his capacity
to deal effectively with any personal issues.  Undoubtedly, his, and his
partner's concerns, for
the welfare of the family unit are sincere, but it is
not unreasonable to assume that he has only further jeopardised their position
by his actions in this respect.</i>
<P>

<i>Reservations are therefore held as to the offender's capacity to appropriate
any benefit the Court may extend to him in its deliberations
with respect to
his personal circumstances.  Nevertheless it is of note that Mr Simpson has not
come under Police notice since 1991,
and has not been the cause for any undue
concern within the local community until being charged with the current
offence."</i>
<P>

28  	I would add that the author continued that the prisoner was
assessed as unsuitable to serve a sentence by way of periodic detention
and
that there was no suitable agency to permit of the imposition of a community
service order.  In my opinion, however, neither
of these options addressed by
the probation and parole officer would be appropriate in this case in any
event.  The gravity of this
offence plainly demands full time custody.
<P>

29  	The prisoner is to be given credit for his plea upon
arraignment.  His conduct after he first discovered the body of the deceased
in
removing it from the backyard was reprehensible but he is to be given credit
for his co-operation with the police so soon after
the commission of this
crime.  I am prepared to accept that the prisoner acted in panic in treating
the body of the deceased in the
manner in which he did.  Not only has the
prisoner's behaviour facilitated the administration of justice in relation to
the prisoner's
crime, but it is also reflective of contrition and I accept that
the expressions of contrition by this prisoner in Court and earlier
to his
parish priest have been genuine.  I accept that the prisoner has been much
troubled by the consequences of his criminal behaviour.
<P>

30  	I have regard to the evidence favourable to the prisoner that
has been given by Father Saunders and by Mrs Elliot-Ranken. 
There have also
been a number of references reflecting well of the prisoner.
<P>

31  	The prisoner has performed some useful community work in the
Clean Up Australia campaign, in Meals on Wheels and in assisting
young people
in sporting and recreation activities.
<P>

32  	Two medical reports dealing with psychiatric assessment have
been placed before the Court, one by Dr Walker, whose report is
dated 5 March
1999, and the other by Dr Westmore, whose report is dated 28 June 1999.  I have
considered those reports and I note
that the prisoner is suffering from a form
of depression in response to his recognition of his crime and the implications
to himself
and his family.
<P>

33  	Mr Rosser submitted that I should find special circumstances in
this case.  In my opinion there are such circumstances.  The
prisoner is to
serve a prison sentence for the first time, and he is going to require an
extended period of supervision when ultimately
he is released from custody in
the interests of his rehabilitation and with a view to guarding against a
relapse into drug abuse.
<P>

34  	The prisoner's rehabilitation is however only one of the matters
I am called upon to consider in determining an appropriate
sentence.  I must
impose a sentence which reflects the gravity of the crime and which makes
appropriate allowance for considerations
of deterrence.  As far as deterrence
of the prisoner himself is concerned, I consider it unlikely that he would
re-offend again in
like fashion.  However, the deterrence of others who might
to tempted to offend is an important consideration in this case.
<P>

35  	The denunciatory role of sentencing is also an important matter
here.  A human life has been taken and unlawful homicide has
always been
recognised by the law as a most serious crime:  see <i>R v Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%203%20A%20Crim%20R%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 3 A
Crim R 397</a> at 402.  See also <i>R v McDonald</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 12
December 1995).  In the latter case in the judgment of the court, it was
said:
<P>

<i>"The protection of human life and personal life is a primary objective of
the system of criminal justice.  The value which the community
places upon
human life is reflected in its expectations of that system."</i>
<P>

36  	Evidence has been placed before the Court from a psychologist,
Ms Limnios, and that report addresses the impact of the death
of the deceased
upon his mother and his stepfather.  That evidence has been received under Pt
6A of the <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>.  As <i>R v Previtera</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 A
Crim R 76</a> makes clear, it is not appropriate for me to take account of the
subject matter of that report in determining a proper sentence.
 Nevertheless,
a reading of the report evidences the serious consequences of the death of the
deceased upon the lives of his mother
and his stepfather, and the Court
expresses its condolences to the deceased's close relatives.  It is to be hoped
that their grief
will be softened by the passage of time.
<P>

37  	Mr Rosser submitted that I should approach the imposition of an
appropriate sentence here by regarding the behaviour to be
punished as criminal
negligence rather than causing death by an unlawful and dangerous act.  I have
earlier expressed my finding
in that respect although I do not consider that
ultimately I am assisted in arriving at an appropriate sentence by placing what
the
prisoner did into one category or the other.  In assessing the prisoner's
crime I must give appropriate weight to all the objective
features of the case
and also to the subjective features.
<P>

38  	I have considered many decisions, both reported and unreported,
before determining what sentence I should impose upon the prisoner.
 However I
have not been greatly assisted by my reading in this respect.  It is trite to
observe that the range of sentences for
the crime of manslaughter is very broad
indeed and it follows from this that it is difficult to derive assistance from
sentences
passed for the offence of manslaughter in other cases, even within
the same category of manslaughter.  So much depends upon the particular
circumstances of each case.
<P>

39  	There have been many judicial statements to this effect.  For
instance, in <i>R v Troja</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 16 July 1991), Kirby P, with
whom the other members of the court agreed, said at p 3:
<P>

<i>"This aspect of sentencing law, as it applies to a person convicted of
manslaughter, presents a particular difficulty to an appellate
court where it
is invited to review the sentence imposed by the trial judge in the exercise of
that judge's discretion.  In the vast
range of circumstances giving rise to
such a sentence, it is difficult to perceive any clear pattern or coherent
standards.  As Wood
J himself observed, the sentence which is appropriate to
each case of manslaughter depends ultimately upon its own special
circumstances.</i>
<P>

<i>These considerations do not, of course, withdraw the facility of an
appellate review for a prisoner convicted and sentenced of manslaughter.
 But
they do make the task of the sentencing judge most difficult.  They render the
legitimate range of sentences available to him
or her greater than is the case
with most other offences..."</i>
<P>

40  	I have found no case with facts similar to those in this present
case.
<P>

41  	To classify the crime as manslaughter by criminal negligence
does not, of itself, assist in arriving at an appropriate sentence.
 There will
be cases in which manslaughter by criminal negligence will attract a heavy
sentence.  This was recognised in the judgment
of James J, with whom the other
members of the court agreed, in <i>R v Maguire</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 30
August 1995).  In that case, his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"In some cases of voluntary manslaughter where, apart from the partial
defence of provocation or diminished responsibility, the prisoner
would have
been guilty of murder but the Crown has not succeeded in disproving either
provocation or diminished responsibility, a
heavy sentence will be appropriate.
But there will also be cases of involuntary manslaughter, that is cases of
manslaughter by unlawful
and dangerous act or manslaughter by criminal
negligence, where a heavy sentence will also be appropriate..."</i>
<P>

42  	I do not consider it would be useful to record in these reasons
the sentences imposed in other cases to which my research has
taken me.  Nor,
whilst I have not ignored such statistics, do I consider it would be useful to
record statistics as to the sentences
imposed in other cases of manslaughter,
having regard to the consideration to which Kirby P referred in
<i>Troja</i>.
<P>

43  	Mr Rosser drew attention to s 49 of the <i>Crimes Act</i> and in
particular to s 49(1): 
<P>

<i>"(1)	Any person who:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	places or sets or causes to be placed or set, any trap, device or thing
(whether its nature being electronic, electric, mechanical,
chemical or
otherwise) capable of destroying human life or inflicting grievous bodily harm
on any person; or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	knowingly permits any such trap, device or thing to continue to be
placed or set,</i>
<P>

<i>with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm shall be liable to
imprisonment for five years."</i>
<P>

44  	Mr Rosser submitted that the above sub-section, providing for a
maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years, affords some
pointer as to the
gravity of the present offence.  There is, he submitted, an essential element
in the offence under s 49 absent
in the present case, namely the intent to
inflict grievous bodily harm.  Hence he submitted the present offence is
necessarily less
serious than an offence under s 49.
<P>

45  	I do not accept that submission because there is absent from the
offence under s 49 an element present in the present case,
namely that here the
prisoner caused the death of a person by reason of the system he set up and
continued to use.
<P>

46  	I have concluded that I should impose a total sentence of nine
years penal servitude.  In so concluding I take account of the
offence on the
schedule.  In structuring the sentence, I bear in mind the special
circumstances which I have found to exist.  In
the result I pass sentence as
follows:  I sentence the prisoner to a minimum term of six years penal
servitude commencing on 9 July
1999 and to expire on 8 July 2005 and an
additional term of three years to commence on 9 July 2005 and to expire on 8
July 2008.
 I specify 9 July 2005 as the first date upon which the prisoner is
to be eligible for release on parole.
