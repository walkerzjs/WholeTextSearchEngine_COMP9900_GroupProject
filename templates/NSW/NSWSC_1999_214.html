<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:		</b>The plaintiff seeks a declaration that the lease of the
land known as 33 Mons Street, Five Dock, in the state of New South Wales,
between the plaintiff and the first defendant, dated 1 July 1995, is not
governed by the provisions of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/rta207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act</a>
(1987)</u></b>. The plaintiff further seeks an order setting aside orders made
by the second defendant at the  Residential Tenancies Tribunal made
on 2 July
1998, file number 97/07253.
<P>

2	The proceedings involve an appeal from the decision of Mr J Bordon, a member
of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal, dated 2 July
1998 with the file number
referred to.  A number of grounds of appeal are advanced on behalf of the
plaintiff.  The first ground
is that by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/rta207/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies
Act 1987</a> (NSW)</u></b>  the second defendant had no jurisdiction to determine
the matters arising by the first defendant's application dated 11 March 1997;
secondly, that the first defendant as vendor was party to an agreement made in
good faith for the sale of the premises to the plaintiff.
<P>

3	The second defendant has filed a submitting appearance.  In respect of the
proceedings, the Minister for Fair Trading has intervened.
 There is no dispute
raised as to the right of the Minister for Fair Trading to intervene in respect
of the proceedings before the
court.
<P>

4	It is appropriate for me to record that this is an appeal assigned to the
Administrative Law Division pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> (3B)(ii) &amp; (iii) of the
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW)</u></b>.  The appeal is filed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s107.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
107(2)</a> of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a></u></b>.
<P>

5	The plaintiff seeks a declaration, in effect, setting aside the decisions of
the Residential Tenancies Tribunal  "the RTT".  Further,
as I have indicated,
the plaintiff seeks to set aside the particular orders on 2 July 1998 made by
Mr J Bordon of the second defendant
against the plaintiff in favour of the
first defendant concerning the first defendant's tenancy of the premises.
<P>

6	It is agreed that the factual matrix in relation to the issues that arise in
the present proceedings is to be found in the intervener's
written submissions.
It seems to me it is appropriate, bearing in  mind the agreement referred to,
that I should record at this point
in time the facts in respect of the
matter.
<P>

7	The first defendant is an elderly man.  Premises known as 33 Mons Street,
Five Dock, (the residential premises), had been occupied
and owned by the first
defendant for many years prior to 7 February 1990.  On 7 February 1990 the
Federal Court of Australia made
a sequestration order against the estate of the
first defendant pursuant to the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a> (Cth)</u></b>.  A Mr
Hugh Jenner Wily became a registered trustee of the estate of the first
defendant pursuant to the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></u></b>  on 8 February 1990.
The bankrupt estate of the first defendant was annulled by the Federal Court of
Australia on 26 February 1991.
<P>

8	In or about 1994 the State Bank of New South Wales took possession of the
residential premises.  On 23 February 1995 a search
of the Land Titles Office
recorded that Hugh Jenner Wily was the registered proprietor of the residential
premises and such search
further disclosed a mortgage to the State Bank of New
South Wales Limited.
<P>

9	In about early 1995 the first defendant responded to an advertisement in a
city newspaper which said something along the lines:
 "Do you have any money
problems?"  The first defendant, Mr Luckey, had conversations with Mr Byrnes,
who represented the plaintiff
in response to the advertisement.
<P>

10	On 1 July 1995 the plaintiff and the first defendant executed at least two
documents as follows:  First, a  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>  Mortgage document referable
to the residential premises recording the plaintiff then known as Byrnes
Property Group Pty Ltd as mortgagor
and the first defendant as mortgagee.  This
document was signed by both the plaintiff and the first defendant.  Next was a
document
headed:  <b>"Residential Tenancy Agreement  -  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies
Act</a>  -  1987"</b>  referable to the residential premises which recorded the
plaintiff again by its former name, as landlord and the defendant as tenant
for
a term of seven years beginning on 1 July 1995 and ending on 30 June 2002 with
rental of $666.66 per month starting on 1 July
1995.  It may be noted that no
reference to the aforesaid mortgage or contract of sale could be found in the
document entitled: 
<b>"Residential Tenancy Agreement"</b>,  nor could any
reference to the document entitled:  <b>"Residential Tenancy Agreement"</b>  or
contract for sale be found in the said mortgage document.
<P>

11	On 10 July 1995 the plaintiff and the first defendant executed a document
entitled:  <b>"Contract for Sale of Land"</b>  of the residential premises in
the form of a 1992 Law Society of New South Wales and Real Estate Institute of
New South Wales contract
describing the first defendant as vendor and the
plaintiff  again by its former name, as purchaser for a purchase price of
$134,000.
<P>

12	On 10 July 1995 a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> Memorandum of Transfer of the
residential premises was signed by or on behalf of the plaintiff by its former
name  and the first
defendant and dated recording the first defendant as
transferor and the plaintiff as transferee.  On or about 10 July 1995 the
plaintiff
paid out the first defendant's indebtedness to the State Bank of New
South Wales in the sum of $99,000 thereby releasing any entitlement
the bank
had over the residential premises.
<P>

13	As a matter of history, it is appropriate to record that the first defendant
received a notice from the  Residential  Tenancies
Tribunal  requiring him to
attend the Tribunal on 22 August 1996 in response to an application to that
Tribunal pursuant to the 
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a></u></b>  ("the
Act") made by the plaintiff.  The terms of settlement agreement dated 22 August
1996 resolved the plaintiff's application
to the Tribunal.
<P>

14	On 25 November 1996 the plaintiff further applied to the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal for determination orders in respect of
the first defendant's
occupancy of the residential premises.  On 3 April 1997 the Tribunal dismissed
the plaintiff's application.
<P>

15	On 11 March 1997 the first defendant made application to the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal against the plaintiff seeking, inter
alia, orders for
repairs to be made and a rental reduction as well.
<P>

16	On 14 May 1997 the Tribunal gave leave to the parties to be legally
represented.  Then immediately on 7 November 1997 the formal
hearing before the
Tribunal was adjourned.  Directions were given to the matter of written
submissions.  A question arose  -  and
it is a matter in dispute as well before
me  -  as to whether or not on 7 November 1997 the landlord did or did not
dispute the Tribunal's
jurisdiction.
<P>

17	An ex parte hearing was conducted by the Residential Tenancies Tribunal on 7
May 1998.  On or about 2 July 1998 the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal made a
decision and orders favourable to the first defendant.  On or about 28 July
1998 the plaintiff filed a
summons seeking declarations and orders against the
first defendant and second defendant.  I have earlier stated in these reasons
what the orders are that are now being sought at this hearing.
<P>

18	The Minister for Fair Trading intervened on 12 February 1999 pursuant to the
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW)</u></b>.  It should be recorded now, before I
proceed any further, that in dispute in the current proceedings is whether or
not the plaintiff
consented to the Tribunal having jurisdiction to hear the
dispute being the dispute raised in the application of 11 March 1997. 
What is
not disputed is that there is in existence a document which records, or notes,
that the landlord did not dispute the Tribunal's
jurisdiction on 7 November
1997.  It is appropriate for me to record that the intervener has submitted
that there were a number of
matters of fact which have not been or were not
dealt with by the Tribunal and the intervener has put submissions in relation
to
such matters.
<P>

19	Thus in issue before me is the question as to whether or not in respect of
the subject application to the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal there was, in
fact, consent given to the jurisdiction given by the plaintiff.  Materials have
been put before me in relation
to the question of whether or not the plaintiff
gave consent to the jurisdiction of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal in
respect
of the application.
<P>

20	An affidavit has been read without objection being an affidavit of Mr Byrnes
solicitor sworn 1 September 1998.  On behalf of
the first defendants an
affidavit of Kelly Muirhead sworn 9 September 1998 was read and read without
objection.  In addition, exhibits
to that affidavit have been tendered and have
become Exhibit 1 in the instant proceedings.
<P>

21	It seems to me desirable to determine the question of whether or not consent
to the jurisdiction was, in fact,  given.  Despite
some reservations that I
expressed during the course of argument, in relation to the extent to which I
can now have regard to the
materials that have been put before me, the simple
fact is that the materials have been put before me without objection.  It was
not disputed by the parties, one or all of them, that I should not have regard
to such materials for the purposes of making a finding
of fact in relation to
whether or not consent to the jurisdiction was given.
<P>

22	The question arises as to whether or not there may have been some error in
the Tribunal's referral to a consent being given on
7 May 1997.  It does seem
to me that having regard to the materials before me that there is perhaps an
error in respect of at least
the date and that one is really speaking in terms
of whether or not consent was given on 7 November 1997 as opposed to 7 May
1997.
 Having regard to the position adopted by the parties, I will make a
finding of fact as to this consent question, to the extent that
it be relevant
to the ultimate decision.  I am prepared to and do make a finding of fact that
on 7 November 1997 the landlord plaintiff
did, in fact, inform the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal that it did not contest its jurisdiction to entertain the
application.
<P>

23	In his submissions Mr Trebeck, on behalf of the first defendant, has taken
me to a number of matters that appear in Exhibit 1
and perhaps I can briefly
refer to them.
<P>

24	In Exhibit 1 at KM (6) is to be found the contract of sale to which I have
earlier made reference.  That contract reveals that
it was dated 10 July 1995
showing that the vendor was the first defendant and the purchaser was Byrnes
Property Group Pty Ltd and
it is common ground there has been a change of name
by Byrnes Property Group Pty Ltd to that of the plaintiff.  The document
further
reveals that there was to be a simultaneous sealing and completion on
the same date for a price of $134,000.  I have already mentioned
that document
was dated 10 July 1995.
<P>

25	The Residential Tenancy Agreement is also set forth in Exhibit 1 at KM 16.
It is an agreement between the plaintiff and the first
defendant bearing date 1
July 1995 and preceded the contract for sale between the same parties.  It is
noted that the agreement in
relation to rent is for a payment by the first
defendant to the plaintiff in the sum of $666.66 starting on 1 July 1995 and
being
payable on the first of the month.  The term of the agreement was seven
years commencing 1 July 1995 and ending on 30 June 2,002.
<P>

26	My attention has been directed in particular to the mortgage document (KM
28) appearing in Exhibit 1, that document reveals a
mortgage of the subject
property.  The mortgagor being the plaintiff and the mortgagee being the first
defendant.  That document
was executed on 1 July  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%20P%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995. P 3</a> of the document
shows that there were to be loan repayments in the amount of $666.66,  first
such payment being on 1 July 1995. It
is to be observed in passing that this
amount of repayment is the same amount of the monthly rental referred to in the
Residential
Tenancy Agreement.
<P>

27	Particularly relevant is the decision of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal
which is incorporated in Exhibit 1 and commencing
at KM (116).  In its reserve
decision in the subject application the Tribunal did deal with the issue of
jurisdiction and it is appropriate
if I here set out the  Tribunal's decision
in relation to the matter of jurisdiction:
<P>

	"(1)	The landlord is to cause a licensed trades person to carry out the
following work up to a total cost of $3,000 at the premises
on or before 30
July 1998: - (a) repairs to electrical wiring at rear of premises;  (b)
replacement of cooking facilities, sink,
windows and cupboards in kitchen.
<P>

	(2)	The Tribunal determines that rent for the premises has been excessive
having regard to the withdrawal and reduction of facilities
by the landlord.
<P>

	(3)	It is determined that from 28 August 1996 for a period of twelve months,
rent should not exceed $222.22 per month.
<P>

	(4)	Having regard to the amount of rent already paid by the tenant for that
twelve month period constitutes an overpayment of $5,333.28,
and having regard
to the orders made above in relation to repairs to be carried out and the
jurisdictional limit imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a>,
the tribunal orders that the landlord pay the tenant the sum of $2,000
forthwith.
<P>

	(5)	The above orders exhaust the jurisdictional limit set by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(3)</a> at the
time of application."
<P>

28	    At KM (122), under the heading of "Jurisdiction": 
<P>

	"The applicant and the respondent entered into a Residential Tenancy Agreement
on 1 July 1995.  Furthermore, the respondent company
(or its predecessor) had
made an application to this Tribunal on a previous occasion seeking orders for
termination of the Residential
Tenancy Agreement.  The question of jurisdiction
was considered by Mr Graham Cochrane (a member of this Tribunal), in relation
to
that application, following a hearing on 12 March 1997.  The Tribunal on
that occasion specifically considered the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)(a)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a> which provides as follows:
<P>

	6(1) "This Act does not apply to a Residential Tenancy Agreement;
<P>

	(a)  If the tenant is party to an agreement made in good faith for the sale or
purchase of the residential premises.";
<P>

	The Tribunal nevertheless concluded on the facts that it had jurisdiction.  On
7 May 1997, the respondent acknowledged that the
Tribunal had jurisdiction.  In
those circumstances, I am satisfied that I have jurisdiction to determine this
matter."
<P>

29	That said, it is appropriate for me to mention that the Tribunal appears to
have incorporated, in effect, as part of its reasoning,
the decision on
jurisdiction of another member of the Tribunal.  That decision is found again
in Exhibit 1  commencing at KM (70).
 The decision is dated 3 April 1997.  At p
4 of the reasons of Mr Cochrane's decision is to be found his reasons in
respect of the
issue of jurisdiction.
<P>

30	The following appears at p KM (73), under the heading of "Jurisdiction":-
<P>

	"The preliminary question to decide is the effect of s 6(1)(a) of the
RTA87.
<P>

	6(1)	This Act does not apply to a Residential Tenancy Agreement.
<P>

	(a)	If the tenant is a party to an agreement made in good faith for the sale
or purchase of the residential premises;
<P>

	The view I have taken of this in previous applications is that a purchaser in
possession of premises prior to completion under
Tenancy Agreement is exempt
from the provisions of the Act.  Such a person is a licensee or tenant at
will.
<P>

	The situation for a vendor/prospective tenant is more complicated.  Clearly a
purchaser/prospective landlord cannot grant a tenancy
prior to completion.  The
legal estate of the owner subsumes any purported grant of a lesser interest.
<P>

	The rationale for excluding vendors who become tenants prior to completion has
been amply illustrated. Arguments have been presented
before the Tribunal as to
the condition of the premises at the commencement of the tenancy; the
obligations to provide and maintain
the premises in 'reasonable repair' and
argument over what fixtures and/or fittings were or were not included in the
sale.
<P>

	As a matter of practise agents and solicitors should ensure that the Tenancy
Agreement is entered into after completion of the
sale/purchase.
<P>

	I read the section as excluding jurisdiction if at the time of entering into
the Tenancy Agreement the tenant was a party to a
contract for sale or
purchase.
<P>

	The facts of the present case are, of course, different. Indeed, they are
highly unusual.  I note with great interest that the
mortgage Luckey to Byrnes
dated 1 July 1995 and Transfer Luckey to Byrnes dated 10 July 1995 have both
been certified correct for
the purposes of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> by the
same solicitor. I do not understand this certification.
<P>

	On 1 July 1995 the Trustee in Bankruptcy H J Wiley was registered as
proprietor of the land.
<P>

	Byrnes Property Group Pty Ltd was not, as stated on the mortgage dated 1 July
1995, "registered as the proprietor in fee simple".
(I wonder how and when the
first mortgage was registered and came into being).
<P>

	How could Byrnes Property Group Pty Ltd grant a tenancy dated 1 July 1995
commencing 1 July 1995 with rent due from that date?
H J Wiley was still
proprietor.  The property was next transferred to Luckey on 10 July 1997 and
then to Byrnes. Nevertheless, they
did. It is quite clear that on the day the
tenancy was entered into, My Luckey was not a party to an agreement made in
good faith
for the sale or purchase of the premises.
<P>

	The Tribunal has jurisdiction."
<P>

31	I should also add to what I have said that the award of the Tribunal in
respect of the matter of compensation has been incorporated
into an order
pursuant to s 112 of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act</a></u></b>  and that
order was dated 6 July 1998.  It is an order that the plaintiff in these
proceedings pay to the first defendant in these
proceedings the sum of
$2,000.
<P>

32	It is appropriate if I now turn to consider the provisions of the
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act</a> </u></b> that are perhaps relevant to the
determination of the instant proceedings.
<P>

33	Residential Tenancy Agreement is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(1)</a> of the Act of the
definition of  <b>"Residential Tenancy Agreement"</b>  as follows:-
<P>

	"Means any agreement under which a person grants to another person for value a
right of occupation of residential premises for
the purpose of use as a
residence: (a) whether or not the right of exclusive  occupation; (b) whether
the agreement is express or
implied; and (c) whether the agreement is oral or
in writing, or partly oral and partly in writing, and includes such an
agreement
granting the right to occupy residential premises together with the
letting of goods."
<P>

34	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act deals with the matter of agreements and premises to
which the Act does not apply. I set out the provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)(a):</a>-
<P>

	"This Act does not apply to any residential tenancy agreement:
<P>

	(a)  if the tenant is a party to an agreement made in good faith for the sale
or purchase of the residential premises".
<P>

35	It is not disputed that the contract for sale on 10 July 1995 was made in
good faith within the meaning of s 6(1)(a).  A focus
point of debate has been
as to the meaning of the word  "is"  in the expression  "is a party"  within
the meaning of s 6(1)(a) of
the Act.
<P>

36	It seems to be accepted as and between the plaintiff and the first defendant
that the document dated 1 July 1995 came into effect
as a <b>Residential
Tenancy Agreement</b> upon the completion of the sale of the premises to the
plaintiff by the first defendant on 10 July 1995.  On the other hand, the
Minister as intervener has submitted that the document dated 1 July 1995 had
effect as a  <b>Residential Tenancy Agreement</b>  on 1 July 1995 existing
legally as such from 1 July 1995 and thereafter.
<P>

37	Mr Marshall for the plaintiff, has submitted that the first defendant was
strictly only a party to an unperformed agreement for
sale for a period of time
on 10 July 1995.  He argues that, on literal and narrower terms of s 6(1)(a),
the first defendant could
strictly only be said to be a tenant within the
meaning of s 6(1) for the duration of the contract for sale.  He argues that to
interpret
 "is"  in that way would to be contrary to the purposes of the Act
and that the word  "is"  should be interpreted widely to give
effect to s
6(1)(a) in respect of the vendor sale lease back transaction.  I Trust I do no
injustice to Mr Marshall's careful written
and oral submissions by stating the
argument in these terms.
<P>

38	For the first defendant, it has inter alia been submitted that even if there
was a  <b>Residential Tenancy Agreement</b>  on 1 July 1995 albeit, it is not
strictly necessary for me to resolve that particular matter, nevertheless, the
preferred construction
is that the Act continues to apply in cases of a vendor
selling and leasing back for a long term.  He submits that such an
interpretation
would accord with the purposive approach of the relevant
legislation.
<P>

39	In the circumstances of this case, I do not consider that it is necessary to
resolve what is the precise status and description
to be accorded to the
document dated 1 July 1995.  That said, I consider that that first submission
of the first defendant should
be accepted.  Indeed, it is a submission at least
reflected in part by one of the submissions that was advanced on behalf of the
intervener Minister.  Mr Quickenden, who appeared on behalf of the Minister,
submits that s 6(1)(a) applied to  <b>Residential Tenancy Agreement</b> during
the performance of the sale agreement whenever such agreement was formed, when
the tenant is a party to the sale agreement
of the subject premises in New
South Wales.  As I have already indicated, that submission to an extent, also
reflects the submission
that I have referred to and advanced on behalf of the
first defendant.
<P>

40	The submissions of the first defendant and the intervener to which I have
referred and which substantially mirror each other
should be adopted in respect
of the terms of s 6(1)(a).  It seems to me that such accords with the purposive
approach that should
be adopted in respect of that section.  (See the reasoning
of McHugh J in <b> <u>Newcastle City Council  v  GIO General Limited</u></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2072%20ALJR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 72 ALJR 97</a> at 110-114).
<P>

41	What I have said is really sufficient to dispose of this case.  However, it
is appropriate for me to, nevertheless, turn to another
aspect of the matter
which has caused me some considerable concern.  It touches upon alternative
submissions advanced by Mr Trebeck
in respect of the issues in the instant
case.
<P>

42	Mr Trebeck also submitted that the plaintiff's appeal should in any event be
rejected for further and independent reasons.  The
reasons may be summarised as
follows:  On 7 November 1997 while the lessor was legally represented by a
solicitor the same solicitor
who acted for the plaintiff on the purchase of the
property, the plaintiff expressly conceded that the Tribunal's jurisdiction was
not disputed.  I have already made a finding in respect of that matter.  The
plaintiff did not withdraw the concession in the hearing
before the Tribunal
nor did the plaintiff make an application under s 110 for the setting aside of
the orders based on the withdrawal
of the concession.  As the first defendant
correctly pointed out, the plaintiff now seeks to challenge in this Court the
very matter
it conceded below.
<P>

43	I must say, were I concerned with merely the justice and merits, it would be
appropriate for me to give effect further or alternatively
to the submission on
behalf of the first defendant.  Indeed, in the instant case, the plaintiff
company had commenced two sets of
proceedings before the same Tribunal  -  the
first in August 1996 and the second in November 1996.  The matter of
jurisdiction in
circumstances of this case was fully dealt with, accepted, and
not thereafter challenged.
<P>

44	There was a third set of proceedings commenced on 11 March 1997 by the
tenant in respect of which there was again a concession
as to jurisdiction.
Finally, in respect of the proceedings with which this appeal is concerned, the
plaintiff, as I have said, conceded
that the Tribunal had jurisdiction.  It
seems to me somewhat unmeritorious against that background for the plaintiff to
now suggest
to this Court that despite its conduct and despite its concessions,
that the plaintiff should be permitted to argue before this Court
that the
Residential Tenancies Tribunal, in fact, possessed no jurisdiction to entertain
the proceedings, the subject of this appeal.
<P>

45	The first defendant submits that the plaintiff should not now be permitted
to depart from the way it conducted its case before
the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal and that the plaintiff should be bound by the conduct of his case at
the trial.
<P>

46	The first defendant has referred to the decisions particularly of the High
Court in <b> <u>Water Board  v  Moustakas</u>  </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20180%20CLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 180 CLR 491</a>, the <b>
<u>University of Wollongong &amp; Ors  v  Metwally (No 2)</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2059%20ALJR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 59
ALJR 481</a> at 483, and <b> <u>Coulton  v  Holcombe</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 7</a> at
78.  It seems to me that those cases are somewhat distinguishable from the
instant matter because those cases dealt not with the
issue of jurisdiction,
but rather with the matter of raising new arguments on appeal the success of
which could depend on findings
of fact being made or capable of having been
made at the original trial.  I am sympathetic to the first defendant's position
and
I believe were it necessary to decide it, there would be much merit in it
in the circumstances of this case.
<P>

47	Interestingly enough, Mr Marshall, who appears for the plaintiff, and Mr
Quickenden, who appears for the intervener, have both
sought to distinguish
decisions of<b>  <u>Moustakas</u> </b> and  <b><u>Metwally</u></b>.  I am
indebted to them for their assistance in respect of this particular issue.
<P>

48	As I would understand the submissions by both Mr Quickenden, and directly or
indirectly adopted by Mr Marshall, it is said that
the principles expounded in
<b><u>Moustakas</u></b>  and the cases referred to relate to matters not argued
at trial and have questionable application to jurisdictional issues or as
to
the form of hearing before a Residential Tenancy Tribunal.  Mr Quickenden took
me to the decision of  <b><u>Mayor, Alderman &amp; Citizens of Norwich  v
Norwich Electric Tramways Ltd</u></b>  [1906]) 2 KB 119 and the decision of
Gibbs J, as he then was, in <b> <u>Sobanai  v  Nitshe</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%2016%20FLR%20329" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 16 FLR
329.</a>
<P>

49	The point I believe that is made by both Mr Quickenden and Mr Marshall is
that despite the plaintiff's unmeritorious conduct
and despite the plaintiff's
consent to jurisdiction in the instant proceedings and the concessions made
earlier in the earlier proceedings,
nevertheless, the plaintiff can still, on
an appeal such as this, raise a jurisdictional point.  Were it necessary for me
to decide,
I would be prepared, in the circumstances of this case, to conclude
that not only is the point sought to be raised one that is belatedly
raised,
but also that, in all the circumstances, it would be unmeritorious and would
potentially render an injustice to the first
defendant.  Thus, were I compelled
to decide the matter, and I do not believe I am, I would consider that there is
much force and
substance in the submission of the first defendant. Indeed, in
the instant case, not only did the plaintiff concede jurisdiction,
but, as I
understand the situation, the plaintiff, in effect, walked away from the
proceedings, and the matter proceeded ex parte.
 So were it necessary for me to
decide the point, I would consider that in the circumstances there is a basis
for concluding that
the point raised by the plaintiff, in respect of
jurisdiction, in terms of justice or in terms of having merit should not be
accepted.
<P>

50	One other matter that needs to be considered is the first defendant's
alternative submission which is raised in par 11 of his
helpful written
submissions.  That paragraph is to the effect that, in the case of a sell
leaseback arrangement predating the contract
for sale, the vendor does not
become a tenant until after completion.  His submission is based upon an
analysis of the matter in
terms of property law.  It seems to me that in the
circumstances that I have already stated, that it is not necessary for me to
determine
this further or alternative submission of the defendant.
<P>

51	I have said enough in this somewhat lengthy ex-tempore judgment to indicate
what the result should be in this case.  For the
reasons stated, I am of the
opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.
