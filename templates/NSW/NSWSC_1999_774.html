<b>	NO 4253/90 - WINSTON LLOYD ARMSTRONG V CECIL 	GEORGE 	STAGG - ESTATE OF
JENNIFER SOMERVILLE</b>
<P>

<b>	JUDGMENT;</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:  </b>This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> by the plaintiff in respect of the estate of the late Jenifer
Somerville who died on 24 December 1997 aged 58 years. The deceased
was
survived by the plaintiff who had been living with her on a bona fide domestic
basis for some years, her two sisters and one
brother.  Her brother, Mr Stagg,
is the defendant. 
<P>

2   	The deceased had previously been married however she had no
children and was divorced in the early eighties. There has been
no notice given
to her husband of these proceedings however I have heard evidence of the
circumstances of that marriage as reported
by the deceased to the plaintiff.
Those circumstances indicate that the deceased had travelled to New Guinea on a
boat that both
she and her former husband had worked to acquire. Apparently the
parting was not amicable and it appears that she left that relationship
having
been given an airline ticket and $100 to come back to Australia. Apparently it
would seem that there was no contact with the
former husband thereafter so far
as the plaintiff knows.
<P>

3   	The defendant himself does not know of those circumstances.
The nature of the evidence would tend to indicate that any claim
by the husband
of the deceased would be one somewhat remote in time and given his occupation
and the circumstances as recounted to
me I am satisfied that I can disregard
the interest of the former husband of the deceased. 
<P>

4   	Under the will of the deceased which was made on 5 November
1997 the deceased left the furniture and possessions which she
had to the
plaintiff together with a car. She also left $10,000 to the plaintiff as a
pecuniary legacy. The balance of her estate
was divided between her three
siblings. The property which the deceased owned at the time of her death has
been reduced to cash and
the present amount which the estate has is
$190,251.68. There will be costs which have to be paid out of this amount.
There are firstly
the cost of the administration of the estate and the sale of
the realty which amount to $8,183.05. The defendants' costs in respect
of this
claim amount to $18,896. The plaintiff's costs if he were successful amount to
$18,300. This is a total of $45,379.05. This
leaves a net distributable estate
of some $144,872.63. 
<P>

5   	It is useful to deal with some of the chronology dealing
with the history of the deceased and those around her. The deceased
herself was
born on 26th September 1939. The plaintiff was born on 14 April 1946 in New
Zealand. He completed schooling until year
10 and obtained a butchery
apprenticeship. In Australia the deceased married John Somerville on 23
December 1967. In 1972 the plaintiff
came to Australia and married. It was on
the 31st May 1980 that the marriage between the deceased and Mr Somerville was
dissolved.
Thereafter in March 1987 she purchased a property at 4/45 Victoria
Avenue, Penshurst for $42,000. There was a mortgage at that stage
of some
$35,700. In 1990 the plaintiff's marriage was dissolved and in May 1992 the
plaintiff and the deceased met. In August 1992
the plaintiff moved into the
deceased unit at Victoria Avenue, Penshurst. At that stage he was working for
Kandweld Products earning
the sum of $360 a week net. The arrangement that he
and deceased came to led to the plaintiff contributing $100 a week together
with
$50 per week contribution to food. He also paid half the rates and other
outgoings on the property. In effect $120 per week was used
as his contribution
for paying off the mortgage which still remained on the property. 
<P>

6   	In October 1992 the deceased had a lump removed from her
breast and ultimately in July 1993 had her right breast removed. In
August 1993
the plaintiff and the deceased agreed to become engaged and had a party to
celebrate. There is some dispute about a ring
but given the nature of these
proceedings it is not necessary or appropriate that I resolve that dispute. The
plaintiff himself had
little by way of assets when he met the deceased. He did
however have a car and a caravan and some other personal property which
he
sold. He purchased in February 1994 a fruit and vegetable business in Culburra.
He then went to that business and operated it
during the week. On the weekends
either he would come back to the deceased's home or on the other weekends the
deceased would come
down to Culburra. Clearly they continued living together
but only being together on the weekends. In November 1995 the mortgage on
the
deceased's unit was finally discharged. At about the same time the business
that the plaintiff had been operating in Culburra
failed and he came back to
Sydney and resumed living with the deceased. The arrangements then were that he
was paying $150 per week
plus board plus half the outgoings. 
<P>

7   	Apart from the failure of his business the plaintiff
apparently was concerned about the difficulties that the deceased was
starting
to have at that stage with her illness. She retired from work in April 1996 and
at that stage there was also a change to
the contribution. Apparently the
plaintiff ceased to pay any amounts of contribution to the mortgage. It would
seem that his contributions
towards the mortgage amounted to something in the
order of $12,310. 
<P>

8   	By August 1996 the deceased's illness was advanced to the
stage where she was having chemotherapy and other treatment and in
September
she found out that she had inoperable lung cancer. The following year the
plaintiff had some difficulty with his own health.
In April 1997 he had an
ankle reconstruction and in  July he suffered from a burst pancreas. In October
that year the deceased had
not been very well and she went to Tasmania to see
her brothers and sisters and make other arrangements given her pending death.
In November 1997 she made a will. On 21st November 1997 the plaintiff and the
deceased moved out of the deceased's home into a rented
unit at 10/33 Oxford
St, Mortdale. The reason was quite simply that in the deceased unit there were
a large number of steps which
she could no longer manage and she needed a level
entry to move to and from her home. By the middle of December she had to go to
hospital because of her illness and she was transferred to Calvary Hospital on
20 December.  She died four days later.
<P>

9   	In due course probate was granted and these proceedings
were commenced within time. By October 1998 the plaintiff became entitled
to a
full disability support pension because of health problems from which he was
suffering. The result of that was at the end of
April 1999 the deceased's
property was sold and there were funds which now make up the distributable
estate. 
<P>

10   	In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High
Court has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse</b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201812%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1812 CLR 201</a> set out
the two stage approach that a Court must take. At page 209 it said the
following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'"? The difference between 'adequate' and 'roper' and the interrelationship
which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'roper maintenance' etc were
explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>. The determination of
the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an assessment of whether the
provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in all the circumstances, was
the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for the applicant having
regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial position, the size
and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship
between
the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and
other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or her bounty.
<P>

	
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations. Indeed, in the first stage of the proceed,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the property level of maintenance and
what is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark
upon the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine
the order which
should be made in favour of the applicant. In saying that, we
are mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court could
refuse
to make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper maintenance.
Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors". 
<P>

11   	The plaintiff's situation is fairly simple but not a happy
one. He is fifty three years of age, he has no dependents. He does
have
children but they however are self supporting. One of his children lives up on
the Sunshine Coast in  Queensland as does his
brother. Presently he receives an
invalid pension of $420 a fortnight. The rent of the premises in which he and
the deceased lived
was $440. Clearly he cannot meet the expenses and he is
relying upon his son to support him and keep him. His cash reserves have
dwindled away. He did sell the car which he received under the will for $7500
and he went back to New Zealand and spent some $1700
of those funds on that
trip. Given his age and his desire to see his birth place again, that was not
an unreasonable expense. However
most of those funds have gone and all he has
left now is his pension entitlement of some $5,000 and $300 or $400 in the
bank. He
owes $1800 on his Master Card. His personal situation in some other
respects is not good mainly because of health reasons. He had
his driver's
licence cancelled because he has a sleep apnoea condition which causes him to
doze off. He has problems with his ankles
and he has difficulty walking in
winter time. His burst pancreas requires medication and he presently takes some
nine tablets a day.
Apart from that medication he also takes other medication.
Clearly his condition is such that he can no longer work. 
<P>

12   	The other things that the Court has to consider in a case
such as this are the ways in which the plaintiff has been left without
adequate
and proper funds for his maintenance education and advancement in life. In this
regard the plaintiff primarily puts forward
his lack of a residence and any
assets of any substance. Certainly as I have said he is unemployable. He has
given consideration
to his present situation and sensibly sees that he cannot
afford to continue where he is. He wants to move up to Maroochydore on
the
Sunshine Coast to be near one of his children and his brother.  He has looked
around for units in that area which cost between
$60,000 and $90,000 for a two
bedroom unit. He did not investigate rental properties but he concedes that
rent would be somewhat
less than he is paying in Sydney. As I have mentioned
the plaintiff has contributed to the estate of the deceased and particularly
in
paying amounts that have been used towards paying off the mortgage. He also has
received some benefits from the estate not provided
for in the will. These were
firstly payments of $880 towards his rent which he was authorised to take from
the account by the deceased.
However that account was subsequently closed by
the executor. He also has the benefit now of a bond of some $880 which has been
paid
to the landlord. At the present place where he is living he apparently has
succeeded to the deceased's tenancy. I think in considering
what alteration I
might make to the provision of the will I will take these factors into account
in deciding the appropriate provision.
 
<P>

13   	It is necessary for the court to also have regard to the
situation of other persons who have a claim on the bounty of the
deceased. In
the present case the only ones who have to be considered are the deceased
siblings. 
<P>

14   	Mr Stagg is the youngest child of the four children. He
himself has retired. He is married and is aged fifty eight years.
He and his
wife have a joint pension of some $591 a fortnight. Clearly that would be
expended by them on their day to day living
expenses. Their asset situation is
that they have a house and contents at 43A Bain Terrace Trevallyn estimated at
$120,000, a motor
vehicle valued at $7,000, a boat estimated at $2,000 and
superannuation which he indicates has yet to be received, a total of some
$61,800. He is not able to work and that arises from a condition which he
suffers from. He has ankylosing spondylitis which affects
his spine and that
severely restricts his movements. He is on treatment for that and because of
that disability interfering with
his ability work he had to cease work.
Accordingly he simply receives his pension entitlement. 
<P>

15   	The next person that has to be considered is Irene May
Bourke. She is aged 69 and likewise has no dependents. Her asset situation
is
that she and her husband have their home worth $90,000, a car worth $12,000 and
cash of some $3,000. They do have debts of some
$3,200. They also exist on a
pension of some $600 a fortnight. Their personal situation is somewhat
difficult in that they do not
enjoy good health. She has a problem with her
heart and takes medication to relieve her angina. Her husband who is seventy
two years
old has arthritis which makes it extremely difficult for him to move
about. They have special requirements for cleaning the house
and assistance and
they have a difficulty with their present accommodation. Their house has a
number of levels and that is quite
unsuitable for her husband. They need to
purchase another property but obviously they have no funds to enable a change
over and to
meet expenses. Those expenses are likely to be in the order of
$7,000. There is also a problem that her husband has an injury to
his eye which
will require treatment and there will be a need to travel to Melbourne for that
to be done. Although these matters
affect her husband, directly they do affect
her because of their meagre resources and being reduced to living on the
pension. 
<P>

16   	The other person is Iris Merle Butler. She is aged 66,
married and has no dependents. She and her husband have a house worth
$80,000,
savings of $13,000 and a car of $14,000. They likewise live on a joint pension
of somewhere in the order of $500 per fortnight.
Neither of them can work. Mrs
Butler's husband has had bypass surgery and also requires a total knee
replacement. She has concern
about where they might need to live in the future
and this is not unnatural given the difficulty which her husband has in getting
about. Accordingly they also are anticipating that they may have to change
their residence and move to a different type of accommodation.

<P>

17   	In matters such as this it is necessary to look at the
claims on the estate. Widows claims are frequently the subject of applications
in this court. The Court of Appeal in <b>Goloski v. Goloski </b>(unreported 5
October 1993) has referred to formulations of this standard to be expected in
respect of a widow in terms which refer
to the decision of Powell J in
<b>Luciana v Rosenblum</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65</a> and <b> Elliott v Elliott</b>,
which was approved by the Court of Appeal on 24 April 1986. There his Honour
said:
<P>

"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow as been long and harmonious,
where the widow has loyally supported her husband and
assisted him to build up
and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no
less than to the extent to
which his assets permit him to achieve that result;
first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for the rest of her life
and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have the
capacity to change her home; secondly that she have available
to her an income
sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and free
from any financial worry; and third,
that she have available to her a fund to
which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such modest
luxuries as she
might choose and which would provide her with a hedge against
any unforeseen contingency or disaster that light might bring".
<P>

18   	The same principles apply to widower's claims and others
who are the de facto partners of the deceased. If one looks at that
standard
one has to note a number of matters here. The principle one is of course the
relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased. It was a short one
unfortunately for them. They only had five years so one is not here dealing
with the situation to which
the court was referring but something less. There
was of course the period when the plaintiff was working Culburra. There is
nothing
in the evidence which would suggest to me that the de facto
relationship and the closeness between the parties dissipated at this
time.
After all the evidence is that they spent each weekend together. The other
thing that has to be borne in mind is of course
that there was the support both
morally and physically that the plaintiff provided to the deceased in 1996 on
when the deceased's
illness became worse. Although the depth of care increased
later in August 1997, certainly there was the moral support and the transport
and other matters provided by the plaintiff to the deceased in 1996.  The close
support and personal attention given by the plaintiff
to the deceased over the
closing months of her illness bespeak of a closeness and a depth of
relationship.
<P>

19   	Normally in matters such as this the brothers and sister's
claims normally would fall behind that of a spouse or partner.
However the
brothers and sisters are not in a good situation and clearly their difficult
and financial circumstances should be taken
into account. Accordingly it is
appropriate that there be an increase in the provision of the legacy in favour
of the plaintiff.
<P>

20   	The orders that I make are as follows:
<P>

1. In lieu of the legacy in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $10,000 who
receive a legacy of $80,000.
<P>

2. The defendant's costs on an indemnity basis and the plaintiff's costs on a
party and party basis to be paid or retained out of
the estate.
<P>

3. The exhibits can be returned.
