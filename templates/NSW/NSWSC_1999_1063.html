<b>JUDGMENT (Transfer to the District Court)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: These proceedings are of a nature not uncommon
in terms of the initiation of an action which finds itself in the
Defamation
List of the Supreme Court. It arises from what shortly can be described as a
trade union election. It is indeed, to my
present knowledge, not the only
matter of such a kind in this morning's list. 
<P>

2   	That such a political process as a trade union election
would give rise to vigorous campaigning and documents reflecting that
vigour is
to be expected. That there may be a perception that the ordinary rigours of
industrial politics have been exceeded by a
particular publication in the
course of them also might be understood.
<P>

3   	The constituency within the area of trade union elections
is by its nature limited. It is not to be taken however that the
boundaries of
the constituency necessarily restricts the boundaries of publication.
<P>

4   	Defamation proceedings arising from such an event need not
be remarkable in terms of defences that may be available. The defence
that may
be pleaded may as a matter of principle involve interests and important legal
considerations within the factual context
that will be established at a
hearing. With respect to this particular action I am not persuaded that
anything precludes me from
making the order sought, the question of the
availability of the <b>Lange</b> defence being amenable to resolution in the
District Court as much as it is here.
<P>

5   	I direct that this matter be transferred to the District
Court of New South Wales for hearing in Sydney.
<P>
