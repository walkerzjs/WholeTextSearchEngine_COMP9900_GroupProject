FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES - JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS - REAL PROPERTY (TORRENS SYSTEM).
Shortly after District Court proceedings are served
on male defendant, he seeks
and obtains a consent order under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/dfra220/" class="autolink_findacts">De Facto Relationships Act</a> in the Local
Court for the transfer to the female defendant of two properties which comprise
substantially all his assets, and the
required transfers of those properties
are registered under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>.  Plaintiff obtains judgment in the
District Court, and seeks orders under s.37A of the Conveyancing Act avoiding
the transfer. 
HELD that the male defendant in seeking and obtaining the Local
Court order and effecting the transfers intended to defraud creditors;
that the
female defendant shared that intention, so would not have the protection of the
indefeasibility provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>; (semble) that in any event
s.37A prevailed over those provisions; that although an order avoiding the
transfers would be inconsistent
with the Local Court order, the Court could
mould its order to avoid the transaction so that it was not inconsistent, for
example
by ordering a re-transfer of the properties; (semble) that s.37A
empowered the Court to set aside the Local Court order obtained
as part of an
alienation to defraud creditors; and that the Court could order the defendants
to apply to the Local Court to set aside
the order.  Re Baxter  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20FamLR%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 FamLR

<b>IN THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

CORAM:   HODGSON,CJ IN EQ.
<P>

<u>Friday 19th February 1999</u>
<P>

<b><u>NO. 4290 OF 1996</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SILVERA    V.    SAVIC &amp; ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: :   Pursuant to consent orders purportedly made on 7th November
1995 under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 by
the Fairfield Local Court, by
transfers registered on 5th March 1996, the first defendant Victor Savic
transferred to the second
defendant Cveta Arsenic two properties, namely 60
Doyle Avenue, Budgewoi and 5 Argyle Place, Macquarie Fields.
<P>

2	On 29th November 1996, the plaintiff Iris Silvera obtained judgment in the
District Court of New South Wales against Mr. Savic
for $83,316.00 plus costs.
In these proceedings commenced in December 1996, Ms. Silvera seeks orders to
the effect that the transfers
to Ms. Arsenic are void and/or that Ms. Arsenic
holds the properties in question on trust for Mr. Savic, and further orders to
ensure
that these properties should be available to satisfy the District Court
judgment.
<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

3	I will begin with an outline of facts which are not substantially in dispute.
In reciting these facts, I will not discuss whether
and for what purposes
particular facts may or may not be admissible against particular defendants on
particular issues.  I will look
at that matter where necessary later in the
judgment.
<P>

4	Ms. Arsenic was born in 1950.  In 1979, she became the owner of the property
Unit 15, 412 The Horsley Drive, Fairfield, which
she purchased for $25,700.00.

<P>

5	Ms. Arsenic met Mr. Savic in about 1982, and a sexual relationship commenced
between them.  At least until 1987 or 1988, Mr. Savic
spent at least weekends
and holidays with Ms. Arsenic at her Horsley Drive unit, although it appears
that he was working in the country,
apparently in the Budgewoi area.  
<P>

6	By transfer dated 23rd December 1982, Mr. Savic became the owner of 60 Doyle
Avenue, Budgewoi, which he purchased for a price
of $22,500.00.00.  He built a
house on this property in about 1984.  
<P>

7	By transfer dated 1st March 1985, Ms. Arsenic became the owner of the
adjoining property, 58 Doyle Avenue, Budgewoi, which she
purchased for a price
of $21,000.00.  
<P>

8	There are three children of the relationship:  Stojan born 23rd October 1985,
Simeun born 19th March 1988, and Nikola born 6th
January 1992.  
<P>

9	According to Ms. Arsenic, from about 1988 Mr. Savic no longer lived with her
even on weekends and holidays, no longer kept personal
belongings at her
residence, but called at her residence to see the children and used her house
as his mailing address.  On occasions
she took the children to see Mr. Savic at
the Budgewoi property; and it was on one such occasion that they had sexual
relations giving
rise to the birth of their third son.  
<P>

10	It appears that from about 1988 or 1989, Mr. Savic was on workers
compensation, as a result of a work injury.   Also he had a
car accident in
1993, giving rise to a claim on his part which was settled in about 1994.  
<P>

11	On 14th September 1994, Mr. Savic signed a home loan application to the
Commonwealth Bank for $25,000.00 for the purpose of purchasing
the property
No.5 Argyle Place, Macquarie Fields for a price of $70,000.00.  The application
stated that the total cost of the purchase
was $72,123.00, including stamp
duty, legal fees, etc.  The application gave his marital status as "sep.", and
his current address
as "15/412 The Horsley Dr., Fairfield".  
<P>

12	The application listed his assets as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>60 Doyle Ave, Budgewoi			$180,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Contents					$   7,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Deposit Paid				$      100.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	CBA Accounts 				$  27,258.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	St. George Account			$  16,562.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	St. George Fairfield			$       203.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

13	The application stated that his monthly income was $700.00 invalid pension
and $659.00 rental Doyle Avenue.  It gave the sources
of finance for the
purchase as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>Loan				$25,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Cash/Savings			$44,023.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Deposit				$     100.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	"Ex Wife's Assistance"		$  3,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

14	On 25th November 1994, a party was held at Ms. Arsenic's Horsley Drive unit.
The plaintiff claims that she was sexually assaulted
at that party in the
presence of Mr. Savic, and it is that claim that gave rise to the District
Court judgment.
<P>

15	On 26th November 1994, Mr. Savic made and signed a statement to the Police
in relation to the alleged assault.  This statement
gave his address as 15/412
The Horsley Drive, Fairfield.  It gave his age as 48, and this seems
uncontroversial.  Paragraphs 3 and
4 of the statement were as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>3.	I have resided at the above address for the past 12 years.  I reside
at the premises with my wife, Cvjeta, and my three sons Nicolas
aged 2 years,
Simon aged 7 years and Stojan aged 10 years.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	4.	On Thursday the 24th November, 1994 I was celebrating the saint name
day of my son Stojan.  I had a number of friends over to
visit and celebrate.
One of those friends was the lady who used to live in the flat above ours her
name is Iris.  Another friend
was a fellow countryman of mine Dusan LUKIC, I
know him from the old country, we even went to primary school
together.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

16	There is in evidence a document purporting to evidence three borrowings of
$5,000.00 by Mrs. Arsenic from one Drago Posudio.
 The first of such borrowings
is stated as having taken place on 8th December 1994.  The other two are stated
as having taken place
respectively on 10th May 1995 and 4th March 1996.
<P>

17	On 1st March 1995, a process server served Mr. Savic at the unit 15/412 The
Horsley Drive, Fairfield with a copy of a Statement
of Claim filed in the
District Court, by which Ms. Silvera sued one Dusan Lukic and also Mr. Savic
for damages in respect of the
alleged sexual assault.  
<P>

18	On 2nd June 1995, Mr. Savic called on the Commonwealth Bank, and advised
that he desired "his wife to be substituted for his
name on the security
property", that is the Macquarie Fields property.  He was advised that a new
application would be required.
 
<P>

19	A new application was thereafter signed by both Ms. Arsenic and Mr. Savic,
and dated 6th June 1995, showing both as applicants
for a loan.  This
application gave the marital status of both as "single", and the address of
both as 15/412 The Horsley Dr., Fairfield.
 It gave the assets of the
applicants as:  
<P>

	<b><i>58 Doyle Avenue, Budgewoi (vacant land)		$ 65,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Contents (furniture, etc.) 				$ 20,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Accounts						$      131.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The Horsley Drive, Fairfield			$120,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	60 Doyle Avenue, Budgewoi			$130,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Cash on hand					$    5,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

20	The application gave the monthly income of the applicants as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>Invalid pension					$  700.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Supporting mother's pension			$1,200.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Rental on Doyle					$   659.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

21	This application resulted in an approval for a loan of $15,180.00 to
re-finance the existing loan to Mr. Savic, which apparently
had been reduced to
that amount from the original principal of $25,000.00.  The security was to be
a registered first mortgage over
the same property.  Among the general comments
noted on the application form, but apparently not verified by the applicants'
signatures,
were the words "Mr. Savic desires to have his defacto wife placed
on security property as sole owner".  
<P>

22	It appears that on 24th August 1995, the solicitors Watson Stafford sent a
letter to Ms. Arsenic in the following terms:

23	In late October 1995, Ms. Arsenic received from Watson Stafford a further
letter dated 24th October 1995, in the following terms:

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

24	On 31st October 1995, Ms. Arsenic swore an affidavit, prepared by Watson
Stafford, before a Chamber Magistrate at Fairfield Local
Court.  The affidavit
was in the following terms:-
<P>

	<b><i>1.	I am the Respondent in these proceedings.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	In 1982 the Applicant and I entered into a defacto relationship which
spanned approximately 5 years.  At that time we ceased to

<P>

<b><i>	3.	As a result of this relationship the Applicant and I have 3 children

<b><i>		Stojan born on 23 October 1985</i></b>

<P>

<b><i>	I understand that the Applicant is not likely to be in a strong
financial situation in the near future and readily consent to the
transfer of
the said properties into my name in lieu of maintenance and financial
assistance for our children.</i></b>
<P>

25	On 2nd November 1995, Watson Stafford, on behalf of Mr. Savic, lodged at the
Fairfield Local Court an application for property
settlement under the De Facto
Relationships Act, supported by affidavit by Mr. Savic of the same date.  This
affidavit gave his address
as 10 Vine Street, Fairfield.  The body of the
affidavit was as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>1.	I am the Applicant in these proceedings.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	In 1982 the Respondent and I commenced living together in a defacto
relationship.  This relationship officially lasted for five
(5) years at which
point the Respondent and I separated.  Although we were no longer living
together, the Respondent and I continued
to have a relationship for some time
after this.</i></b>

<P>

26	On 7th November 1995, Fairfield Local Court made a consent order in the
following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>1.	An order by consent under Division 2 Part 3 of the De Facto
Relationships Act 1984 to transfer interest in respect to properties,
namely:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>			60 Doyle Avenue, Budgewoi and</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>			5 Argyle Place, Macquarie Fields</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	from the applicant to the respondent.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

27	Thereafter, the Argyle Place property was transferred by an undated
transfer, which specified the consideration as being "Local
Court order".  The
Budgewoi property was transferred by an undated transfer, which left the stated
consideration blank.  Both transfers
were registered on 5th March 1996, with
the result that Ms. Arsenic became the registered proprietor of both
properties.  As a result
of the transfers, Mr. Savic was left without any
significant assets.
<P>

28	On 1st May 1996, Ms. Arsenic signed an enquiry with Westpac seeking a loan
of $100,000.00 for the purpose of building a house
on the Macquarie Fields
property.  In the form, the marital status was stated as "divorce".  The assets
were stated as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>Lot 70 Macquarie Fields			$ 70,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	60 Doyle Avenue				$120,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	15/412 The Horsley Drive			$150,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	58 Doyle Avenue				$ 65,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Commonwealth Bank			$ 12,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Cash					$ 20,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Furniture				$ 40,000.00</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

29	The form then gave monthly income as $1,816.00 and rent $1,360.00.  
<P>

30	Westpac granted a mortgage loan on 8th May 1996, and thereafter the loan has
been used to build a house on the property, in which
Ms. Arsenic now
resides.
<P>

31	On 22nd August 1996, Mr. Savic swore a Defence to the District Court
proceedings, in which he gave his address as 15/412 The
Horsley Drive,
Fairfield.  
<P>

32	On 26th September 1996, a process server Stephen Goodwin went to 15/412 The
Horsley Drive, Fairfield.  In an affidavit sworn
2nd October 1996, he gave the
following account of what happened:
<P>

	<b><i>On Thursday, 26 September 1996 at approximately 6.20am I attended the
address of 15/412 The Horsley Drive, Fairfield.  I spoke to
a female occupant
and I said to her "Could you tell me your name please?"  She said my name is
"Cveta Arsenic".  I said "Does Victor
Savic live here?"  She replied "Yes, he
does".  I said "Is he at home at the moment?"  She replied "He's not here, he
will be home
at about 3.00pm".</i></b>
<P>

33	On 20th November 1996, the hearing of the District Court proceedings took
place.  In evidence, Ms. Arsenic gave evidence to the
effect that she was never
at any time the de facto wife of Mr. Savic.  Also in evidence she agreed that a
process server had spoken
to her at around the time and in the general
circumstances suggested in Mr. Goodwin's affidavit, but she denied that on that
occasion
she said to the process server that Mr. Savic lived at the
property.
<P>

34	On 29th November 1996, the District Court judge gave judgement in favour of
Ms. Silvera against Mr. Savic for $83,316.00 plus
costs.  On 19th December
1996, Mr. Savic lodged an appeal to the Court of Appeal from that decision:
this appeal was dismissed on
17th July 1998.  
<P>

35	Ms. Arsenic gave evidence at the hearing of the proceedings before me, but
Mr. Savic did not appear and did not give evidence;
and no explanation was
offered on behalf of Ms. Arsenic for the absence of evidence from Mr. Savic.
No evidence was called from any
solicitor involved in the application to the
Local Court.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

36	The decision of the case involves consideration of the following issues.

<P>

37	First there is the question of the credibility of Ms. Arsenic:  it has been
submitted on behalf of Ms. Silvera that I should
find that Ms. Arsenic was
prepared to give deliberately false evidence on oath.  
<P>

38	Next, there are a number of evidentiary issues.  Some of the material in the
case, including assertions by Mr. Savic referred
to in my outline of facts as
having occurred on 14th September 1994, 26th November 1994, 2nd June 1995, 2nd
November 1995, and 22nd
August 1996, and also the general comment in relation
to the application dated 6th June 1995, have been unconditionally admitted
only
against Mr. Savic; and it was left for submissions and decision at the end of
the case whether they were admissible at all against
Ms. Arsenic and if so, to
what extent and for what purpose.  There is also a question as to whether there
is any <u>Jones v. Dunkel</u> inference to be drawn against Ms. Arsenic by
reason of the absence of evidence from Mr. Savic.  
<P>

39	Next, it is necessary to consider what was the relationship between Ms.
Arsenic and Mr. Savic at the time of the Local Court
proceedings and the
challenged transactions, and also their legal and equitable rights in respect
of their assets prior to these
events.  
<P>

40	It is then necessary to consider what were their intentions and
understandings in relation to the transactions.  
<P>

41	It is then necessary to consider whether the plaintiff has made out a case
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, at this stage leaving aside any
question as to the effect of the Local Court orders.  That section is in the
following terms:-
<P>

	<b><i>37A.(1)	Save as provided in this section, every alienation of property,
made whether before or after the commencement of the Conveyancing
(Amendment)
Act 1930, with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable at the instance
of any person thereby prejudiced.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(2)	This section does not affect the law of bankruptcy for the time
being in force.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(3)	This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property
alienated to a purchaser in good faith not having, at the
time of the
alienation, notice of the intent to defraud creditors. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

42	Since transfers to Mrs. Arsenic have been registered, I may need to consider
whether she is protected by the indefeasibility
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act</a>.
<P>

43	Finally, if I come to the view that relief should be given under s.37A
leaving aside any consideration of the Local Court order,
it will be necessary
to consider the effect of the Local Court order and whether any relief can be
given having regard to its existence,
and if it can, precisely what relief
should be given.  This may also involve considering an application to amend
made by the plaintiff.
 
<P>

44	I will deal first with all issues apart from the effect of the Local Court
order, and then I will consider the effect of that
order.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES APART FROM LOCAL COURT ORDER</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

45	Both sides have provided written outlines of submissions, and I will leave
them with the papers.  In my outline here, I will
refer mainly to the oral
submissions.  
<P>

46	Mr. Harris for the plaintiff first dealt with the credibility of Ms.
Arsenic.  He pointed to what he claimed was inconsistent
evidence which she
gave concerning the existence or otherwise of a de facto relationship with Mr.
Savic, and also concerning assistance
from Mr. Savic in making mortgage
payments, particularly from rent from the Budgewoi property.  He pointed out
that Ms. Arsenic admitted
that she doesn't always tell the truth, although she
claimed that she did tell the truth when she took an oath on the Bible.  He
also submitted that she was not responsive to many questions, such as the
signature on the document evidencing loans from Drago Posudio.
 Mr. Harris
submitted I should find that she did not set out to tell the truth to the
Court. 
<P>

47	Mr. Harris submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> may apply even if

<P>

48	The evidence of Ms. Arsenic as to her intentions was irrelevant.  She was
not a purchaser within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A.</a>  In any event, her evidence as to her intentions
should be rejected.
<P>

49	Mr. Aldridge for Ms. Arsenic submitted that she was a purchaser:  by
accepting the particular orders under the De Facto Relationships
Act, she put
herself in a worse position as regards making a further claim.  In agreeing to
the consent orders, she gave up any further
rights under the Act, and undertook
to accept obligations under the mortgage.  Furthermore, she acted in good
faith.  She was concerned
to make provision for her children.  Although she was
aware of Ms. Silvera's court proceedings, her evidence was that she was told
they had very little prospects of success.  The case against Mr. Savic was a
novel one, and the Court should accept Mrs. Silvera's
evidence that her
intention was to protect her children.  Furthermore, the Court should accept
Mrs. Savic's evidence concerning her
relationship with Mr. Savic, and in
particular that there was no continuing de facto relationship.  He was a
regular visitor to the
house, he looked after the children, and slept over on
occasions.  Ms. Arsenic herself worked most nights.  
<P>

50	If any order was made, it should be limited to the Budgewoi property.  There
was a mortgage to the bank of the Macquarie Fields
property, and third parties
should not be prejudiced.  Furthermore, Ms. Arsenic had borrowed money from the
bank in order to build
a house on the property, and she was paying off this
mortgage.
<P>

51	In addition to referring to the cases of <u>Cannane</u> and <u>Grellman</u>,
Mr. Aldritch also relied on <u>Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v. Mitchell</u>

<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

52	On the question of the credibility of Ms. Arsenic, in my opinion she was
prepared to give false evidence to the Court when she
believed it suited her
interests.  In her affidavit to the Local Court, sworn to support an
application for a consent order under
the De Facto Relationships Act, she swore
that she entered into a de facto relationship with Mr. Savic in 1982, which
spanned approximately
five years.  In her evidence to the District Court on
20th November 1996, she asserted that there never was a de facto relationship.
In her affidavit sworn for these proceedings, she swore "I have never
considered the relationship as living together as husband and
wife".  In her
oral evidence before me, she claimed confusion as to what constituted a de
facto relationship.  I accept that there
are cases in which the existence or
otherwise of a de facto relationship is unclear, and that this may be so
particularly where one
of the parties spends a lot of time away from the other,
as apparently was the case here between 1982 and about 1988.  However, from
the
terms and manner of her evidence before me, I have reached the clear opinion
that Ms. Arsenic is prepared on this matter to say
what she believes at the
time to be to her advantage, and to take refuge in confusion when this suits
her purpose.  
<P>

53	In my opinion also, Ms. Arsenic is prepared to give false evidence about her
financial means.  I do not rely at all on the claim
she made for privilege
against self-incrimination.  In her affidavit in the Local Court, she asserted
to the effect that she had
made the mortgage repayments on the Macquarie Fields
property, because of Mr. Savic's poor financial situation since his work
accident.
 However, it is clear that Mr. Savic was for most of the relevant
time receiving over $600.00 per month rental on his Budgewoi property,
in
addition to an invalid pension; and Ms. Arsenic conceded that at least some of
the mortgage payments were made from money he provided.
 In my opinion, Ms.
Arsenic prevaricated about her own means, and failed to produce documents which
would be expected if she were
honestly setting out to properly inform the Court
about her financial situation.  
<P>

54	Turning to other evidentiary issues, I accept that in general statements
made out of court by Mr. Savic are not any evidence
against Mrs. Arsenic, even
on the question of what Mr. Savic's intention was in making the transfers.
However, some of his statements
are admissible against Ms. Arsenic, for limited
purposes.  
<P>

55	Mr. Savic's loan application of 14th September 1994, and associated
documents, are in my opinion business records showing that
he obtained a loan
of $25,000.00 towards the purchase of the Macquarie Fields property for
$70,000.00.  I do not think the fact that
he gave his address as 15/412 The
Horsley Drive, Fairfield in that document, to the police on 26th November 1994,
and in his affidavit
in support of his District Court Defence, is admissible
against Ms. Arsenic.  However, I note that Ms. Arsenic said in her evidence
that Mr. Savic gave her address as his mailing address.  The statements made by
Mr. Savic about his intention on 2nd June 1995 and
again on 6th June 1995 are
in my opinion admissible evidence of his intention or wishes at the time:
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> s.72.  The contents of his affidavit of 2nd November 1995 may be
admissible as to his intention, as against Ms. Arsenic, if I find
them to be
deliberate lies.  
<P>

56	On the question of whether the failure of Mr Savic to give evidence in the
case can give rise to a <u>Jones v. Dunkel</u> inference against Ms. Arsenic, I
consider that other material in the case justifies a conclusion that there is a
continuing close
relationship between them, so that such inference can be
drawn.  First, there is Ms. Arsenic's admission that he would use her address
as his mailing address, and the fact that it was given as his address in their
joint document of 6th June 1995.  Next, there is the
process server's evidence
that on 26th September 1996, Ms. Arsenic said that Mr. Savic lived at that
address:  the process server
was not cross-examined on that evidence, and I
accept it.  Next, there is the payment by Ms. Arsenic over a considerable
period of
time of Mr. Savic's very substantial legal fees.  The continuing
relationship may or may not be a de facto relationship, but in my
opinion it is
sufficiently close and cordial to make it appropriate that the <u>Jones v.
Dunkel</u> inference be drawn.  
<P>

57	Next, I consider the relationship and legal and equitable rights of Ms.
Arsenic and Mr. Savic at the time of the Local Court
proceedings.  
<P>

58	In my opinion, there was then a close and reasonably cordial relationship.
On the balance of probabilities, I find they were
living in the same premises,
with their three children.  I find that this was so on 6th June 1995 and 26th
September 1996, so that
it may be concluded that it was also the case in
November 1995.  
<P>

59	Turning to their legal and equitable rights in the various properties, it
seems clear that Mr. Savic was the sole owner of 60
Doyle Avenue:  Ms. Arsenic
claims she lent him $5,000.00 to help with the purchase of the land, and
$8,000.00 to help with the building
of the house, but she does not claim that
these were other than loans.  It also seems clear that Ms. Arsenic was the sole
owner of
58 Doyle Avenue and the unit in The Horsley Drive.  As regards
Macquarie Fields, Ms. Arsenic says she put in $20,000.00, Mr. Savic
put in
$30,000.00, and the bank contributed $25,000.00.  She also says that Mr. Savic
owed her $13,000.00, and that instead of repaying
that, he would help her buy
the land.  Although for reasons I have given, I cannot rely on her evidence, I
think all the circumstances
support the view that she made a substantial
contribution to the purchase of that property   $10,000.00 of the $15,000.00
borrowed
from Drago Posudio was borrowed at a time when that money too could
have gone towards the property.  On the whole, I am satisfied
that Ms. Arsenic
had an equitable interest in the Macquarie Fields property, and that is
confirmed by contributions which I am satisfied
she has made towards repaying
mortgages on the property.  Doing the best I can on the meagre and
unsatisfactory evidence that I have,
I find that her interest in the Macquarie
Fields property, prior to the Local Court proceedings, was a one-half
interest.
<P>

60	Next, I consider the intentions and understandings of the parties at the
time of the Local Court proceedings, and the subsequent
transfers.  
<P>

61	In my opinion, there was no substantial change in their relationship at any
time prior to the Local Court proceedings that would
have given rise to any
occasion for the application for such orders or the making of such orders.
They were still living together
in the same house.  In my opinion, the Vine
Street address given by Mr. Savic was a deliberately false address.  In my
opinion, both
parties gave knowingly false evidence to the Local Court
concerning their relationship, their means (in particular, omitting reference
to Mr. Savic's rent from the Budgewoi property), and the source of payments for
the Macquarie Fields mortgage.  The consequence of
the transaction was that Mr.
Savic was left with substantially no assets.  The timing of the transaction was
shortly after Ms. Silvera's
Statement of Claim was served.  I have no evidence
from Mr. Savic.  I have found that Ms. Arsenic has given false evidence.  In
those
circumstances, in my opinion I am justified in drawing the inference
against Ms. Arsenic that the application for the Local Court
orders and the
consequent transfers were made by Mr. Savic with intent to defraud creditors,
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>; and in particular, to
defeat any claim Ms. Silvera might have against him.  
<P>

62	In my opinion, Ms. Arsenic shared this intention with Mr. Savic, so that she
is not protected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A(3).</a>  In those circumstances, I do not need to
consider whether the exercise of rights under the De Facto Relationships Act
could be regarded
as making her a 'purchaser' within that subsection.
Furthermore, because of that finding, it is in my opinion clear that the
indefeasibility
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> do not protect Ms. Arsenic.
I am inclined to think that if a transferee acted in good faith and had no
notice of the intent to defraud
creditors, but did not have any protection from
s.37A(3) because he or she was not a purchaser, the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> would prevail over the indefeasibility provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a>.  It is clear that the indefeasibility provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a> do operate in favour of volunteers, but s.37A is a more specific
provision which itself identifies the transferees against whom it
is not to
prevail.  However, for reasons I have given, this is something I need not
decide in this case.
<P>

63	It follows that, apart from the possible effect of the Local Court order, my
opinion is that a case is made out in relation to
the 60 Doyle Avenue property
and a one-half interest in the Macquarie Fields property.

was that the de facto
relationship ended in about 1987 and, since no leave was sought under s.18(2)
of the De Facto Relationships
Act, the two year limitation provided by s.18(1)
of the Act applied.  Furthermore, s.10 of the De Facto Relationships Act
provides
that a Local Court shall not have jurisdiction under the Act in
relation to property of a value in excess of the amounts prescribed
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act 1970</a>, namely $40,000.00.  In any event, an
order that Ms. Arsenic transfer to Mr. Savic certain property would not be
inconsistent with
the Local Court order:  it contained no declaration of the
interests of the parties, but merely required certain transfers which
were
carried out.  The Local Court order accordingly is spent.
<P>

65	Alternatively, Mr. Harris submitted that the Local Court could set aside an
order made pursuant to a deception of the Court:
 <u>Brooke v. Lord Mostyn</u>
<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1864/324.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1864] EngR 324</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281864%29%2033%20Beav%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1864) 33 Beav. 457</a> at 459.  This Court could make an appropriate declaration,
and then make orders providing for an application to the Local Court to
set
aside its own order.  Any necessary amendment to the summons to provide for
that type of relief should be granted.  
<P>

66	Mr. Aldridge submitted that while the Local Court order was on foot, Ms.
Silvera could not seek orders which conflicted with
it:  <u>Re Baxter</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20FamLR%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 Fam.LR  758</a>; <u>Chamberlain v. Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 502.</a>  Further, the fact that the transfers were effected under
compulsion of law meant that the requisite intent under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.37A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> must be lacking.  This Court does not have the power to
declare the Local Court order was made without jurisdiction, as sought in
the
summons:  any approach to this Court must be by appeal or application for
certiorari.  Certiorari would not be available:  <u>Craig v. The State of South
Australia</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 163.</a>  In any event, s.12(5) of the De Facto
Relationships Act states that any failure of the Local Court to comply with the
requirement
to transfer matters where the property concerned was beyond the
prescribed value does not invalidate any order; and failure to obtain
leave
under s.18(2) of the Act could not invalidate a consent order.
<P>

67	Mr. Aldridge submitted that no amendment had properly been sought to seek
orders providing for an application to the Local Court.
 In any event, such
orders would be inappropriate.  There was no set priority between the rights of
de facto spouses and the rights
of creditors:  cf. <u>Deputy Commission of
Taxation v. Swain</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/238.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 238</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2020%20FCR%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 20 FCR 507.</a>
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

68	Dealing first with Mr. Aldridge's submission that the intent required by
s.37A could not be shown where the transfer was made
pursuant to a Court order,
I note that in this case I have found that the intent to defraud creditors
applied to the whole transaction
of applying for the consent order and
effecting the transfers.  In those circumstances, I see no reason why s.37A
should not apply.
 
<P>

69	The case of <u>Re Baxter</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20FamLR%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 Fam.LR 758</a> does support Mr.
Aldridge's contention that this Court should not make orders inconsistent with
the Local Court order, while it stands.
 In that case, a husband and wife in
1959 entered into a terms contract with the Victorian Housing Commission to
purchase a house
as joint tenants.  In 1971, the husband became bankrupt; and
in 1976, he was discharged from bankruptcy.  As a result of the bankruptcy,
the
Official Trustee in Bankruptcy claimed that the equity of the house was owned
by himself and the wife as tenants in common in
equal shares.  In 1984, the
wife applied to the Family Court for orders under the Family Law Act with
respect to the house.  In October
1984, the Family Court declared that the wife
was the sole proprietor of the equity in the house, and ordered the husband to
transfer
all his interest in the terms contract to the wife.  Subsequently, the
Trustee applied to the Federal Court seeking directions as
to whether the
husband's interest in the house was vested in the Trustee.  Northrop, J. held
that the Federal Court should not determine
the Trustee's application for
orders inconsistent with the Family Court orders until the Family Court orders
were set aside.  This
was notwithstanding his view that certain authorities to
which he referred suggested that the Family Court had no power to make the
declaration which it made in October 1984.  
<P>

70	To somewhat similar effect is the case of <u>Morris v. Maroudas</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1986/406.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] FCA 406</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2070%20ALR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
70 ALR 98.</a>  That case concerned a franchise agreement entered into in April
1983 between Mr. and Mrs. Maroudas and Mr. and Mrs. Morris.  Mr.
and Mrs.
Morris breached that agreement in June 1983.  In July 1983, Mr. and Mrs.
Maroudas commenced action in the District Court
of Western Australia for
damages for breach of that agreement.  In September 1984, Mr. and Mrs. Morris
executed deeds of assignment
of their property to a trustee appointed for the
purposes of Pt.X of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a> (Cwlth).  In January 1985, Mr. and
Mrs. Maroudas obtained judgment in the District Court for $48,660.00 for breach
of the franchise
agreement.  In December 1985, Mr. and Mrs. Morris applied to
the Federal Court for orders that the judgment of the District Court
be set
aside (or that execution of the judgment be stayed), and for a declaration that
they were released from the debt or liability
claimed in the District Court
proceedings.  The Full Federal Court (Toohey and Spender, JJ., Northrop
dissenting) held that the Federal
Court had jurisdiction to hear the
application; that there was no power in the Federal Court to set aside the
District Court judgment;
that Mr. and Mrs. Maroudas were owed a provable debt
by Mr. and Mrs. Morris at the date of execution of the deeds of assignment;
and
that the appellants were entitled to a declaration that, by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s230.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.230(1)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a>, the deeds of assignment executed by Mr. and Mrs. Morris
operated to release them from their liability for breach of the franchise
agreement.  Spender, J. expressed the view that the Federal Court could also
have made an order preventing Mr. and Mrs. Maroudas
from executing their
District Court judgment.  Toohey, J. considered that such an injunction should
not be granted, because it would
effectively tie the hands of the District
Court, notwithstanding the judgment entered by that Court.
<P>

71	However, in my opinion, the present case can be distinguished from both
those cases.  In both those cases, there was a plain
inconsistency between the
orders made in the Family Court and District Court respectively, and the orders
sought from the Federal
Court.  In the former case, the Family Court had made a
declaration of right; and in the latter case, there was a judgment for a
sum of
money.  In the present case, the Local Court order did no more than to order a
transfer of particular property from one person
to another.  Particularly in
circumstances where that order was made by consent, and was obtained with the
intention of defrauding
creditors, as I have found, it should be given no wider
effect.  I am prepared to accept that an order directly setting aside the
actual transfer made pursuant to the Court order would be inconsistent with the
Court order; but in my opinion, s.37A can be given
effect to in this case by
other means.  
<P>

72	What s.37A says is that the "alienation" is "voidable".  In my opinion, when
an application is made under s.37A to the Supreme
Court, that Court can achieve
the effect of avoiding the alienation by such measures as seem appropriate in
the particular case.
 For example, the Court could declare that the effect of
the Local Court order is spent by reason of its being carried out by the
subsequent transfers, and then order appropriate re-transfers of the property.
Such orders would not be inconsistent with the Local
Court orders, nor could
they give rise to any possible embarrassment by reason of the existence of
conflicting Court orders.  
<P>

73	For those reasons, notwithstanding the existence of the Local Court order, I
would be prepared to order that Ms. Arsenic transfer
to Mr. Savic the whole of
her interest in the 60 Doyle Avenue property and one-half of her interest in
the Macquarie Fields property.
 However, the object of this exercise is to
provide property against which enforcement of the District Court judgment can
be obtained.
 The re-transfer of the properties to Mr. Savic, followed by Writs
of Execution and possible sale by the Sheriff, may not be the
most effective
way to achieve that end.  It may be more appropriate to make declarations and
orders that bring about an early sale
of the 60 Doyle Avenue property, and the
application of those proceeds towards that judgment, and possibly the costs in
this case.
 If those proceeds are not sufficient, then consideration could be
given as to what steps should be taken in relation to the Macquarie
Fields
property.  
<P>

74	Because of the view I have taken, it is not necessary for me to decide
whether or not I could have declared the Local Court order
to have been made
without jurisdiction, or set it aside, or made some provision for an
application to be made to the Local Court
to set that order aside.  Because
those matters were argued, I think it appropriate for me to express tentative
views on them.  
<P>

75	In my opinion, it would not have been appropriate to declare that the order
was made without jurisdiction.  In any event, as
submitted by Mr. Aldridge, a
lack of jurisdiction has not been affirmatively shown.  Furthermore, there are
difficulties in the way
of this Court setting aside orders of the Local Court.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 69(1)</a> and (2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act 1970</a> are in the
following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>69(1)	Subject to subsection (2), all judgments and orders of a court
exercising jurisdiction under this Act shall be final and
conclusive.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(2)	A party to proceedings under this Act who is dissatisfied with the
judgment or order of the Court as being erroneous in point
of law, may appeal
to the Supreme Court therefrom.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

76	Section 84(1) of that Act authorises the Rule Committee to make rules for or
with respect to "(r)  prescribing the circumstances
in which judgments and
orders may be set aside".  Part 26 r.3 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/lcr180/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Court Rules</a> provides:
<P>

	<b><i>A judgement or order of the Court in any proceedings may, on sufficient
cause being shown, be set aside, on terms, by order of the
court, if the
judgment was given or entered up, or the order was made, irregularly, illegally
or against good faith.</i></b>
<P>

77	Despite the absolute words of s.69, it seems clear from the combined effect
of s.84 and Pt.26 r.3(1) of the Rules that the Local
Court could set aside the
order made in this case as being an order made against good faith.  It would
not be necessary to appeal
to any possible inherent power of the Local Court as
discussed in <u>Hoskins v. Van Den-Braak</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 290</a>;  cf. <u>Coles
v. Burke</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 429.</a>  However, it may be questioned whether this
Court could take that course:  this is not an appeal under s.69, the remedy of
certiori
is probably inapplicable (see <u>Craig v. South Australia</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
184 CLR 163</a> and <u>Kriticos v. State of New South Wales</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR
297)</a>, and it is doubtful whether the general granting of jurisdiction under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> would overcome the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a> (cf. <u>Buzera Pty. Limited v. Mezan Enterprises Pty.
Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20NSWConvR%2055%2d851" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) NSWConv.R. 55-851).</a>
<P>

78	However, it seems to me that s.37A itself may provide the necessary power to
the Supreme Court.   In my opinion, the "alienation"
in this case was the whole
process of obtaining the Local Court order and the consequent transfer; and it
is that whole alienation
which is made voidable by s.37A.  In my opinion, if
one step in that alienation is the fraudulent obtaining of a Local Court order,
then s.37A itself purports to give power to set that step aside.  The question
would be whether that legislative grant of power prevails
over the possible
exclusion of that power by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a>.  On the
whole, I am inclined to think that s.37A would prevail:  the very existence of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s84.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.84(1)(r)</a> in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a> shows that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of that Act
is not intended to prevail over more particular inconsistent statutory
provisions.
<P>

79	The final possibility, namely a declaration and orders making provision for
an application to the Local Court to set aside its
order is also, in my
opinion, one that would be open to this Court.  Having found that the whole
process was undertaken with the
intent to defraud creditors, the Supreme Court
can, in my opinion, order the parties to the transaction to apply to the Local
Court
to set aside the order which they obtained.  However, for reasons I have
given this is not necessary in this case.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

80	For those reasons, the plaintiff Ms. Silvera is entitled essentially to the
relief that she seeks, except in relation to the
one-half interest in the
Macquarie Fields property which Ms. Arsenic owned prior to the impugned
transaction.  However, for reasons
I have given I will not immediately make
orders for the transfer of the relevant properties from Mr. Savic to Ms.
Arsenic.  I will
adjourn the matter for a short time to see if agreement can be
reached as to how this judgment can best be given effect to.  If agreement
cannot be reached in a short time, what I may do is to order the re-transfer,
but stay those orders for a short time in the hope
that some more efficient
means of dealing with the matter can be agreed.  I direct the plaintiff to
prepare short minutes of order.
<P>

81	As regards costs, at present I see no reason why costs would not follow the
event.
