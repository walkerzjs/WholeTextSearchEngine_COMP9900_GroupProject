<b><u>WEDNESDAY, 1 DECEMBER 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>NEWCASTLE:	15/97:    BOSWELL  v  COLES MYER t/as COLES SUPERMARKET
TORONTO</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is a claim for damages for
personal injuries brought by the plaintiff against her former employer.
Liability has been admitted
by the employer thus the case is one calling for an
assessment of damages should the plaintiff not be debarred from so claiming
because
of the provisions of the <b>Workers' Compensation Act</b> 1987 as
amended.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff's claim arises as a result of two incidents
which occurred during the course of her employment with the defendant.
At the
time when those incidents occurred she was employed by the defendant as a
casual filler - which means that she stocked shelves
in the defendant's Toronto
store.
<P>

3   	The first incident happened on 3 February 1994 when she
slipped on some liquid on the floor of the store. She fell heavily,
landing on
the top half of her back. She felt pain in the back of her head, the top of her
shoulders and experienced a pins and needles
sensation running down her right
arm. This incident occurred near the end of the shift the plaintiff was
working, the accident having
occurred at night.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff, as I would understand the evidence, was not
required to report for duty until after the week-end which intervened
following
her injury. She spent most of the week-end in bed suffering from an aching
shoulder and neck. In fact she did not return
to work until the following
Tuesday.
<P>

5   	However, while she returned to her duties stacking shelves
she suffered continued aching in her shoulder and neck and in her
right arm.
These symptoms persisted unabated.
<P>

6   	On 21 February 1994, while lifting a carton of drinks, she
felt a sensation which she described as being like a ping in her
right shoulder
followed by an exacerbation of pain in that area.
<P>

7   	Having reported the incident she then, for the first time,
saw a medical practitioner, a Dr Drew. She continued working but
the symptoms
of pain in her neck and shoulder remained.
<P>

8   	In September 1994, while pushing a carton of milk on a
shelf she again felt a ping in her right shoulder accompanied by a further
exacerbation of pain. She again saw Dr Drew and this time was required to spend
time off work and continued having physiotherapy
treatment which had previously
been prescribed for her condition.
<P>

9   	At this time she was referred to a Dr Pacey by Dr Drew, Dr
Pacey being a rehabilitation physician. Dr Pacey was then of the
view (November
1994) that the plaintiff had a myofacial pain syndrome secondary muscular
injury.
<P>

10   	Dr Pacey in turn referred the plaintiff to a Dr M Katekar
a consultant neurologist for nerve conduction studies. Having conducted
those
studies, Dr Katekar formed the view that the plaintiff was suffering from a
right C8-T1 cervical radiculopathy. These studies
were carried out on 15
November 1994 and the results were confirmed by further nerve conduction
studies on 12 May 1995.
<P>

11   	She remained off work and her treatment consisted
principally of physiotherapy. However, the pain in her shoulder and neck
persisted. It seems she returned to work at end July 1995. Her return involved
a change of duties to a category known as Point of
Sale which involved changing
price tags on various items presented for sale.
<P>

12   	During this time she was also under the care of a
rehabilitative organisation in the Hunter area known as IRS. Again, as I
would
understand the evidence that organisation was responsible for the
administration of physiotherapy to the plaintiff. She also
underwent some
treatment to her neck from a chiropractor.
<P>

13   	Pain continued in her neck and shoulder. Her duties were
varied to include work on cash registers at the store's check out
points.
However, pain persisted and eventually she stopped working for the defendant in
September 1997.
<P>

14   	Prior to that Dr Williamsz, whom I gather is an
anaesthetist, carried out a number of procedures known as right C2-3 MBB which
involved the injection of local anaesthetic. These procedures were carried out
between November and December 1996 and resulted in
temporary relief of her
condition which returned when the effects of the anaesthetic wore off.
<P>

15   	In January 1997 she was sent by an orthopaedic surgeon Dr
L Kleinman who confirmed the diagnosis of radiculopathy at C8-T1
and concluded
that she had a significant neck injury.
<P>

16   	A Dr Thong administered a nerve block injection at C2-3 on
1 April 1997.
<P>

17   	From the time of her first injury on 3 February 1994 until
she ceased work with Coles in September 1997 she missed a variety
of periods
off work due to her neck and shoulder condition. It was agreed between the
parties that she lost wages in the sum of $7,146.
<P>

18   	Having left Coles she and her de facto partner a Mr Bryce
Connelly moved from the Hunter area to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
Initially she commenced work at a Caltex service station as a console operator.
She worked in that position, intermittently, until
April 1998.
<P>

19   	In December 1997 she had returned to Newcastle where Dr
Thong carried out a further nerve block injection.
<P>

20   	She lost her employment with the service station in April
1998. In May 1998 she worked at a snack bar as a kitchen hand that
involved her
carrying trays of food. She found that work too heavy for her having regard to
the condition of her neck and shoulder.

<P>

21   	In September 1998 she engaged in further employment, this
time with an organisation known as Gina's Country Kitchen at Kalgoorlie.
She
worked there as a cook, working some 16 to 30 hours a week. The cooking was
light and involved little heavy work. She continued
there until February 1999
when she changed her employment again at that time.
<P>

22   	She commenced work as a receptionist with an organisation
in Kalgoorlie. She was required to work some 22 &#189; hours per
week. That
work as a receptionist resulted in her neck becoming painful from typing and
bending over a desk. During the time she
worked there she twice worked 40 hours
per week which resulted in an increase in the pain in her neck and shoulder
requiring her
to have physiotherapy three times a week.
<P>

23   	She returned to Newcastle on 1 October 1999 and at the
time of trial was seeking part time work as a receptionist but had
not achieved
that goal.
<P>

24   	She continued to suffer from pain in her neck and right
shoulder. She also has and complained of occipital headaches. There
is little
medical dispute that the plaintiff does suffer pain in her right shoulder, neck
and headaches to which I have referred.
<P>

25   	Dr Seamus Dalton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine
is of the view that she has a right C2-3 zygapophyseal joint dysfunction
relating to the two incidents in February 1994. He is of the view that she
cannot perform heavy or repetitive lifting.
<P>

26   	Dr D. Chapman who is an orthopaedic surgeon is of the view
that she had a C8 disc lesion.
<P>

27   	Dr W Wolfenden who saw her in 1995 on behalf of the
defendant was of the view that she had a C5 radiculopathy rather than
a C8 or
T1 disturbance.
<P>

28   	However as I have said there is no medical issue that the
plaintiff suffered the pain of which she complained and that pain
is related to
the two such incidents. Equally there seems to be no real doubt that the pain
she suffered is permanent.
<P>

29   	She is thus left in a position, as far as her employment
is concerned, of being limited to light work such as that of a receptionist
and
it would seem that that work can only be carried out on a limited basis in
terms of the hours per week.
<P>

30   	Prior to her injuries she was a keen sportswoman playing
squash, softball and to a lesser extent, golf. She had been unable
in
particular to play squash since the accident, a sport she loved. She is now
aged thirty-eight having been born on 11 August 1961.
The loss of her ability
to engage in sporting activities is in my view one of significance in this
case.
<P>

31   	As she had left school at the end of Year 10 her skills
are limited. Accordingly the restrictions placed upon her employability
by her
condition are significant. Pursuant to s 151H of the <b>Workers' Compensation
Act</b> I am called upon to decided whether the injuries from which she suffers
constitute a serious injury. A serious injury as defined
by s 151H(2A) is one
which would give rise to a loss of not less than 25% of the maximum amount
prescribed from time to time referred
to in s 66(1) of that Act. Having regard
to her loss of manual work capacity and her ability to take part in sport and
also particularly
having regard to her age I am of the view that her loss is
quantified as being 27.5% of the maximum amount obtainable under s 66(1).
<P>

32   	Currently the most extreme case under that section would
give rise to an award of $214,650. 27.5% of the most extreme case
amounts to
$59,028.75. I thus award that amount as damages for non-economic loss.
<P>

33   	Between the time she left Coles in September 1997 and the
present time she makes no claim for economic loss. Having regard
to her
injuries I am of the view that it is proper to assess her damages for future
economic loss (for which she qualified having
regard to my finding of her
entitlement to damages for non-economic loss) as being 72.5% of what she would
be able to earn, uninjured,
ie a loss of 27.5% of the wages she would now be
able to earn, uninjured.
<P>

34   	It is agreed that a comparable earner in her previous
employment with Coles would now be earning $265 per week net. Females
working
full time in the retail trade doing the same type of work as the plaintiff used
to do, earn $416 per week net. Prior to her
first injury on 3 February 1994 the
plaintiff was capable of earning in my view, the full amount and by females in
the retail trade.
Accordingly I am of the view that the correct method of
estimating her present loss is to use the figure of $416 and adjust her loss
as
being 27.5% of that figure, namely $114. Having regard to her age a correct
multiplier to use under the 5% tables is 703 which
gives rise to a raw figure
of $80,423.20 which, having deducted 15% for vicissitudes, gives rise to a net
figure of $68,359.72. I
thus award that figure for future economic loss.
<P>

35   	Her out-of-pocket expenses amount to $20,479 of which of
course a large proportion is repayable to the defendant pursuant
to the
<b>Workers' Compensation Act</b>. 
<P>

36   	I therefore tabulate the plaintiff's damages as
follows:
<P>

Out of pocket expenses	20,479.00
<P>

Damages for future economic loss	68,359.72
<P>

Damages for non-economic loss	59,028.75
<P>

Past wage loss	<u>7,146.00</u>
<P>

	155,013.47
<P>

37   	There will thus be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum
of $155,013.47. I shall hear argument on the question of costs after
delivery
of these reasons.
