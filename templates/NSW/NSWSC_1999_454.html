<b>2298/99 -  AAPT LIMITED  v  CABLE &amp; WIRELESS OPTUS LTD &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore, revised 14 May 1999)</b>
<P>

1	This is an urgent application by the defendants to set aside two notices to
produce and a subpoena, argued yesterday.  The plaintiff
is the target in a
proposed takeover by the second defendant.  The bid is a cash bid, subject to
conditions which include a 90 per
cent minimum acceptance condition and a
condition (clause 8.1 (e) of the offer) relating to approval of the acquisition
by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (`ACCC').  Documents
purporting to be a Part A statement and offer were served on the plaintiff
on
28 April 1999.  I shall refer to the purported Part A statement simply as the
Part A statement but I do not intend thereby to
prejudge the issue of its
compliance with the Corporations law.
<P>

2	The documents have not been sent to offeree shareholders.  By summons filed
on 10 May 1999 the plaintiff seeks various orders
which would either enjoin the
defendants from sending the Part A statement and offers or require the dispatch
of the supplementary
disclosure material.  There is also a challenge to the
lawfulness of the acquisition of target shares made by the second defendant
on
16 April 1999, which is not relevant to the issues in the present
application.
<P>

3	The proceedings having been instituted by summons, there is no pleading to
identify precisely the grounds upon which the challenge
to the Part A statement
and offers is based.  The only clue given by the summons is in paragraph 1, by
which the plaintiff seeks
a declaration that the Part A statement does not
comply with clauses 17 and 20 of s 750 of the Corporations Law.  At an ex parte
hearing on 10 May 1999, counsel for the plaintiff sought ex parte orders on the
basis of four complaints about the Part A statement,
namely, that it failed
adequately to:
<P>

	(a) disclose the anticipated benefits which would arise from a merger;
<P>

	(b) address competition issues arising from the merger;
<P>

	(c) address the intentions of the second defendant if it achieves more than 50
per cent but less than 90 per cent of the target
shares as a result of the bid;
and
<P>

	(d) disclose certain aspects of the funding arrangements of the bid.
<P>

4	The case was out of the ordinary in some respects, as will become evident in
these reasons.  Upon the plaintiff giving the usual
undertaking as to damages,
I enjoined the defendants from sending the Part A statement and offers to the
plaintiff's shareholders
until further order and stood the proceedings over for
further hearing on 13 May 1999, on the basis that a final hearing on that
day
may be appropriate.  I granted the plaintiff leave to issue subpoenas addressed
to Merrill Lynch International (Australia) Ltd
and to the partners of the
defendants' firm  of solicitors returnable this morning and I ordered that any
notice to produce served
by either party be called upon at the same time.  In
view of the urgent circumstances, I granted liberty to apply on two hours'
notice.
<P>

5	The plaintiff then served the subpoenas and also served a notice to produce
on each defendant.  The notices to produce are substantially
identical.  The
subpoena directed to the solicitors covers some but not all of the grounds in
the notices to produce.  There is now
no issue about the subpoena to Merrill
Lynch, which has been complied with after amendments were negotiated.
<P>

6	The notices to produce seek documents (widely defined) which may for
convenience be classified into three categories:
<P>

	(i) documents evidencing the statement about the offeror's intention made in
paragraph 18 of the Part A statement,  `intention'
being defined in the notice
to include intentions which are contingent, subject to further consideration or
subject to possible review;
<P>

	(ii) documents subsequent to 29 September 1998 evidencing communications with
the ACCC relating to the acquisition, or evidencing
the defendants' willingness
to give undertakings or take steps to facilitate ACCC approval; and
<P>

	(iii) documents relating to a briefing given to analysts by the defendants and
their solicitors on 3 May 1999 and certain claims
made at the briefing (the
plaintiff having put into evidence a copy of the briefing notes).
<P>

7	In addition to these three categories of material, the notice to produce also
seeks production of drafts of the Part A statement
and of reports by either
defendant to Cable &amp; Wireless Optus plc or its subsidiaries.  The subpoena
is confined to part of categories
(ii) and (iii) and to drafts of the Part A
statement.
<P>

	<b>The position of the first defendant</b>
<P>

8	As a threshold issue, the defendants submit that the notice to produce to the
first defendant could not be justified even if the
notice to produce to the
second defendant were appropriate.  This is because only the second  defendant
is the offeror.  Indeed,
the defendants say that there is no proper basis for
joining the first defendant as a defendant in these proceedings, though no
application
has been made to remove the first defendant from the proceedings.

<P>

9	In my opinion, it would be appropriate to serve a notice to produce in proper
form on the first defendant, given that it is a
defendant in the proceedings.
The question is whether it is appropriate to serve on the first defendant a
notice to produce which
proceeds on the basis that the first defendant has been
involved in a substantial way in the preparation of the Part A statement
and in
the decisions which have led to it.  
<P>

10	According to the cover page of the Part A statement, the offer is made `by'
the first defendant, `through its wholly owned subsidiary'
the second
defendant, although the offer itself identifies only the second defendant as
the offeror (clause 1.1).  Further, clause
18.1 of the Part A statement states
that `the intentions of the first defendant concerning the businesses, assets
and employees of
AAPT are the same as the intentions of the second defendant as
set out in this paragraph 18'.  In effect,  the Part A statement makes
the
first defendant's intentions a relevant matter for disclosure and implies that
the first defendant has been substantially involved
in preparation of the bid
and the Part A statement.  This is confirmed by the briefing notes for the
meeting with analysts on 3 May
1999, which are headed `Cable &amp; Wireless
Optus Ltd: Acquisition of AAPT Limited'.
<P>

11	I do not intend at this stage to determine the question of the first
defendant's joinder in these proceedings since that point
has not been directly
raised.  However, in my view, it is appropriate in the circumstances for the
Court to assess the notices to
produce on the basis that in the present context
no relevant distinction should be drawn between the notice to produce addressed
to the second defendant and the notice to produce addressed to the first
defendant.
<P>

	<b>Grounds for changing the notices to produce and subpoena</b>
<P>

12	At yesterday's hearing the defendants objected to the notices to produce and
subpoena on three related grounds, namely, that:
<P>

	(a) the evidence sought is not relevant to the issues raised in the
proceedings;
<P>

	(b) the notices to produce and subpoena are being used by the plaintiff as a
substitute for discovery; and;
<P>

	(c) they constitute a fishing expedition.
<P>

13	At a further brief hearing of the matter this morning, I granted leave to
the defendants to file affidavit evidence which relates
to the difficulty which
the defendants will experience in complying with the notices to produce.  The
defendants' counsel submitted
this morning that in view of that evidence, the
notices to produce, and consequentially the subpoena, are oppressive and
vexatious.
<P>

14	Let me deal with that issue at once.  The additional evidence, the affidavit
by Colleen Anne Platford sworn today, contains an
estimate that to carry out
the work required to comply with the notices to produce would take at least
four full days, assuming that
senior executives of the defendants are available
to review any documents they hold relating to the acquisition.  This case
represents
a takeover bid which values the target company in excess of $1.3
billion.  The allegations made at the hearing on 10 May 1999 would,
if
substantiated, identify deficiencies in the Part A statement of a potentially
serious kind.  It may be that the allegations are
not substantiated or that
when submissions at the hearing have been made, it becomes evident that
deficiencies have been substantiated
by the plaintiff but they are not serious.
At this stage, however, I must proceed on the basis that there is potentially a
real complaint
about the Part A statement and, therefore, a matter which needs
to be visited thoroughly to the extent that the urgent circumstances
allow.
All of that being so, and in view of the conclusions that I shall express
concerning the defendants' other contentions about
the notices to produce and
subpoena, I cannot conclude that it would be oppressive or vexatious to require
the defendants to undertake
at least four full days of work to produce relevant
material for the hearing.
<P>

15	To the extent, therefore, that the defendants contend that the notices to
produce and  subpoena are oppressive or vexatious,
my view is that on the
evidence that contention is not made out.
<P>

16	As to the other three bases of challenge, the defendants rely on the
following well-known passage from the judgment of Jordan
CJ in<b>
</b><i>Commissioner for Railways v  Small </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1938/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] NSWStRp 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2038%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564</a>, 574:
<P>

<b>	</b>`It is true that a party, unlike a stranger, can be required to give
discovery;  but it is not legitimate to use a writ of subpoena
<i>duces
tecum</i> as a substitute for an application for discovery of documents, or as
an alternative to an application for further and better discovery.
 Discovery
application should be made at the proper time and place.  It would greatly
impede the trial of actions at <i>nisi prius</i>, and impose an intolerable
burden upon the presiding judge, if he were required from time to time to
suspend proceedings and wade
for himself through masses of documents for the
purpose of endeavouring to determine whether any of them are relevant.
Especially
is this so when the documents may be called for whilst the case is
still at the stage when it is difficult or perhaps impossible
for the Judge to
know what may become relevant and what may not.  In the absence of special
circumstances, eg <i>Griebart v Morris</i> a party is no more entitled to use a
subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> than he is a summons for interrogatories, for the
purpose of `fishing', ie, endeavouring, not to obtain evidence to support his
case,
but to discover whether he has a case at all:  <i>Hennessy v Wright</i>,
or to discover the nature of the other side's evidence:  <i>Griebart v
Morris</i>.  Even if the documents are specified, a subpoena to a party will be
set aside as abusive if great numbers of documents are called
for and it
appears that they are not sufficiently relevant:  <i>Steel v Savory</i>.'

Syd LR 380.</a>  The submission assumes, correctly in my view, that the principles
which govern setting aside a notice to produce are relevantly
the same as those
governing the setting aside of a subpoena.
<P>

17	In this case it cannot be said, the day before a hearing which may be the
final hearing, that it is difficult or impossible for
the judge to know what
may become relevant and what may not.  It is true that in the absence of
pleadings and particulars (an inevitable
or highly likely consequence of the
extreme urgency of takeover litigation) it is not entirely clear how the
plaintiff will put its
case against the Part A statement.  But it is evident
from the summons that an attack will be directed to clauses 17 and 20 of s
750,
though not necessarily exclusively;  and it appears from the plaintiff's
submissions on 10 May 1999 that the plaintiff will
complain of the inadequacy
of the Part A disclosure as to synergies and benefits, intentions, competition
issues and aspects of the
funding arrangements.  The Court also had the benefit
of submissions by both parties yesterday in the context of the defendants'
present application.  
<P>

18	It seems to me, therefore, that the Court is able in the present case to
make a determination as to relevance and, to that extent,
the concerns which
underlay Jordan CJ's remarks are not present here.  However, I do not infer
from this that the principles enunciated
by Jordan CJ are inapplicable or are
to be modified in a case such as the one before me.  They are to be regarded as
applicable to
urgent takeover legislation as well as to applications under the
Compensation to Relatives Act.  In particular, it is clear that
subpoenas and
notices to produce cannot be used to obtain material which is not relevant to
the proceedings or used as a substitute
for discovery or for `fishing' in the
sense explained by Jordan CJ.  The question is whether the notices to produce
and subpoena
in this case infringe those principles.
<P>

	<b>The plaintiff's challenge to the Part A statement - relevant issues</b>
<P>

19	Counsel for the defendant submitted, and I agree, that there are broadly
three ways of challenging a Part A statement. First,
it may be contended that
the document does not comply with a specified requirement of the Corporations
Law.  That contention is implied
by the summons, which seeks a declaration that
the Part A statement does not comply with clauses 17 and 20 of s 750.
<P>

20	Secondly, it may be said that the Part A statement is misleading.  The
defendants say that this does not seem to be part of the
plaintiff's case in
light of the summons and what was said by counsel for the plaintiff at the
hearing on 10 May 1999. I disagree
with the defendant on this point.  
<P>

21	In my opinion, it cannot be determined or assumed at this stage that the
plaintiff will not contend at the hearing that the Part
A statement is
misleading because of misstatements with respect to the defendants' intentions
or other material information.  The
summons seeks orders under ss 739 and 1324
of the Corporations Law.  An order under s 739 may be made when the Court is
satisfied
that any provision of Chapter 6 has been contravened.  Section 1324
is available in respect of any contravention of the provisions
of the
Corporations Law.  Chapter 6 contains provisions which deal with misleading
statements in Part A statements: see especially
s 704.  Though not found in
Chapter 6, s 995(2) relates to misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to
the making of takeover
offers, amongst other things.  One cannot infer merely
from the fact that the only relevant declaratory relief which the summons
seeks
relates to compliance with s 750, that the plaintiff will not at the hearing
seek to support the prayers for relief under ss
739 and 1324 by reference to
some other provision of Chapter 6 such as s 704, or some other provision of the
Corporations Law such
as s 995.
<P>

22	It is true that if proceedings are commenced by summons and no particulars
of claim are given, the defendant in those proceedings
may well be placed in
difficulty in knowing the case which it is required to answer.  That is why, in
proceedings conducted at a
less frantic pace than typically occurs in takeover
litigation, it is often appropriate to give directions for the filing of a
statement
of claim.  In the present case it would, I assume, not be in the
interests of either party for the Court to direct the filing of
the statement
of claim and thereby delay the hearing by several weeks or more.  
<P>

23	However, while the defendants in the present case are not in the more secure
position of a defendant at the hearing of a fully
pleaded case, one can readily
imagine proceedings commenced by summons in which the defendant would be much
less clear about the
plaintiff's case than here.  The defendants know that
there is a challenge to the Part A statement.  Though the hearing on 10 May
1999 was ex parte, a solicitor employed by the defendants' solicitor was in the
Court and took notes, those notes being in evidence
on the defendants' present
application.  What was said by counsel for the plaintiff on that occasion was
principally directed to
the application for ex parte injunctive relief and, in
any case, could not be taken to limit the plaintiff's submissions at the final
hearing.  The plaintiff appeared again yesterday and made submissions which
further elucidated its case.  Therefore, the defendants
have been given
indications of the plaintiffs case which should assist them to prepare for the
hearing.  In any event, the plaintiff
offered yesterday to provide particulars
of the claim. If the defendants take up that offer, the case against them may
be further
clarified.
<P>

24	Given these considerations, I proceed on the basis that the contentions that
the Part A statement is misleading with  respect
to matters arising out of
clauses 17 and 20 of s 750 is a contention available to the plaintiff and,
therefore, evidence on that
issue is relevant evidence.
<P>

25	Thirdly, says counsel for the defendant, a Part A statement may be
challenged by contending that undisclosed material information
renders the Part
A statement misleading or causes it to fail to comply with clause 17 of s 750.
It follows from what I have said
that this contention is available to the
plaintiff, at least having regard to the matters referred to in clauses 17 and
20 of s 750
and, therefore, evidence on that issue is relevant evidence in the
proceedings.
<P>

26	I propose now to consider the requirements of clauses 17 and 20 of s 750 and
then to determine whether the evidence sought in
the notices to produce and
subpoena is evidence relevant to the issue of compliance with those clauses.
It must be remembered, however,
that in view of the conclusions I have already
reached, an additional significant question needs to be asked, namely, whether
the
documents sought are relevant to the issue of misleadingness of the Part A
statement with respect to the matters required to be disclosed
by clauses 17
and 20.
<P>

	<b>The requirements of clauses 17 and 20 of s 750</b>
<P>

27	Section 750 sets out in 21 clauses the content requirements with which a
Part A statement is to comply.  The following clauses
are relied upon in
paragraph 5 of the plaintiff's submissions:
<P>

	'17. The statement shall set out any other information material to the making
of a decision by an offeree whether or not to accept
an offer, being
information that is known to the offeror and has not previously been disclosed
to the holders of shares in the target
company.'
<P>

	'20.(1) The statement shall set out particulars of the offeror's intentions
regarding:
<P>

(a) 	the continuation of the business of the target company;
<P>

(b) 	any major changes to be made to the business of the target company,
including any redeployment of the fixed assets of the target
company;  and
<P>

(c) 	the future employment of the present employees of the target company.
<P>

	20.(2) Without limiting the generality of subclause (1), if the offeror has
not made a decision on a matter referred to in paragraph
(1)(a), (b) or (c) but
is considering a possible course of action, or 2 or more possible courses of
action, in relation to the matter,
the statement shall set out that fact and
specify the course of action or courses of action concerned and the reason why
the offeror
has not made a decision on the matter.'
<P>

28	It is appropriate first to make some general remarks about the requirement
of clause 17 and then to consider whether the information
sought in the notices
to produce and subpoena is relevant to contentions which might be made at the
hearing with respect to compliance
with that clause.  Having considered those
matters, I shall then address clause 20 in a similar way.
<P>

	<b>Clause 17</b>
<P>

29	The fundamental importance of clause 17 has been elucidated in several
cases, most recently in<b> </b><i>Aberfoyle Ltd  v  Western Metals Ltd</i><b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%2028%20ACSR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 28 ACSR 187</a> at 209.  Finkelstein J said:
<P>

	`The object of a Part A statement is to give shareholders such information as
will enable them to make an informed assessment of
the offer and decide whether
to accept it or reject it:  <i>Samic Ltd v Metals Exploration Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2060%20SASR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 60

need information relevant to the present value of the shares on offer, and in
some
cases details about the asset backing of those shares, the expected future
profitability of the company and other like information:
 see <i>Unity APA Ltd
v Humes Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2013%20ACLR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 13 ACLR 501</a> at 503.'
<P>

30	In that case it was alleged that clause 17 was contravened because, amongst
other things, the Part A statement failed to disclose
the rationale for the
acquisition, the benefits for the offeror and its shareholders arising from the
acquisition, and the assumptions
upon which the share price was based.  It
appears that there will be broadly similar contentions at the hearing of the
present case,
at least as regards the benefits and rationale of the
acquisition.  Dealing with these matters, Finkelstein J said:
<P>

	`More often than not an offeror will have undertaken an evaluation of the
worth of the shares the subject of a bid and the price
that the offeror is
prepared to pay to acquire those shares.  In the evaluation of what the offeror
is prepared to pay an assessment
of the value of the shares would be but one
component and in many cases it will not be the only material component in that
evaluation.
 Many other matters will be taken into account.  However, clause 17
does not require an offeror to disclose its evaluation of the
shares or the
economic assumptions upon which that evaluation has been based. Speaking
strictly clause 17 is concerned with the disclosure
of facts and circumstances
of which the offeror is aware and not with the disclosure of matters of opinion
about which minds may
differ, assessments that are based on variable
assumptions or predictions or the assumptions or predictions upon which those
assessments
are based. Speaking generally, I would not regard the disclosure of
such opinions, assessments etc to be of much assistance to a
shareholder.  The
accuracy or reliability of the opinions, assessments etc would often be the
subject of challenge and debate.  Rarely
will shareholders have the ability or
the capacity to evaluate competing opinions, assessments etc or the criticisms
that might be
made of them.  Thus, the disclosure of such `information' would
not usually assist a shareholder in making an informed decision whether
to sell
his shares.
<P>

	I do not mean to suggest that in no case would it be of assistance to a
shareholder to be provided with this type of information
- if it be information
at all.  But that would not be a common case and it is not the case here.
<P>

	Apart from this general discussion there are one or two points to be made
about the specific information that is alleged should
have been included in the
Part A statement.  I reject completely the suggestion that the Part A statement
should set out the rationale
for the acquisition and the benefits that would
accrue to Western Metals and its shareholders.  This is a cash bid.  The
shareholders
of Aberfoyle must decide whether to accept or reject a cash offer.
It is of no consequence to them how the bid, if it is successful,
will impact
on Western Metals or its shareholders.'
<P>

31	This is consonant with the common sense approach urged by Bryson J in
<i>Metal Manufacturers Ltd  v  Marsh Electrical Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2029%20ACSR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 29 ACSR 245</a>

<P>

	`Materiality to the making of a decision is a subject which does not have
definite boundaries.  A great many subjects can be woven
into more or less
defensible arguments that they are material to a decision referred to in
Corporations Law 17.  It is not consonant
with the purpose and policy of the
legislation that a very extensive view of materiality should be adopted, or
that everything which
is not wholly extraneous should be treated as material.
Clause 17 is not a proposition from the Logic Schools but is one of the
provisions
of legislation which regulates takeovers in the contemplation that
they are not forbidden or unreasonably impeded and that they actually
will take
place in an efficient, competitive and informed market and under controls in
which that market will function.  Other clauses
in s 750 Pt A describe in
detail the information to be given on stated subjects, and compliance with one
of those clauses would ordinarily
be sufficient, and the `other information' on
a subject with which one of those clauses dealt would be information which, on
an objective
view, truly has a relation to the functioning of an efficient
competitive and informed market.'
<P>

32	In<b> </b><i>Pancontinental Mining  v  Goldfields Limited</i> (1995) 16 ACSR
463 Tamberlin J usefully summarised the case law on the materiality in eleven
guidelines, one of which was:
<P>

	`Materiality of information, where there is a complex proposal, involves
difficult questions of commercial judgment and matters
of degree as to future
conduct about which there can be honest and reasonable differences of opinion.
It is necessary to bear in
mind that the statement should illuminate the issues
rather than confuse them by canvassing all the pros and cons of every
possibility.
 The objective is to present a document which can be understood by
members of the public and which does not confuse.  This includes
a
consideration degree of selectivity designed to confine the information to that
which is really useful.  See <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2015%20ACSR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 15 ACSR
590</a> at 603 (FFC).  An avalanche of trivial detail is to be avoided.  See <i>TSC
Industries Inc v Northway Inc </i>(supra) at 448.'
<P>

33	Hely J agreed with and applied this guideline in<b> </b><i>Savage Resources
v Pasminco Investments</i> (1998) 30 ACSR 1 at 8.
<P>

34	In<b> </b><i>Cultus Petroleum NL v OMV Australia Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/435.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC
435</a> (5 May 1999) Santow J set out some principles to be applied in determining
what is and is not material for the purposes of clause
17.  To a degree, these
principles update Tamberlin J's guidelines in light of later cases.  One matter
which his Honour specially
considered was the relevance of the fact that the
bid is for cash.  He said (at page 18):
<P>

	`The fact that a bid is a cash bid makes less relevant how valuable the
acquisition will be to the offeror, since the accepting
shareholder is not
concerned with the future value of the offeror's shares. Thus disclosure of the
offeror's future plans in relation
to the target need not be disclosed under
Corporations Law 17;  compare <i>Pancontinental Mining Limited </i>(supra) and
<i>Solomon Pacific Resources NL v Acacia Resources Ltd (No.1) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19
ACSR 238.</a>  Whether disclosure is required in a cash bid of some special value
to the offeror of the target, based on information concerning
the offeror not
publicly available, is a question not yet resolved;  see the discussion in
Renard and Santamaria <i>Takeovers and Reconstructions in Australia</i>
(Butterworths) at 8044.'
<P>

35	Here the defendants say that none of the documents sought in the notices to
produce and subpoena is relevant to determine whether
clause 17 is complied
with.
<P>

36	As to the documents relating to the disclosure of the offeror's intentions
in the Part A statement (clause 18) which are sought
in paragraph 1 of the
notices to produce, in my opinion it is unnecessary and even unwise to consider
whether the documents sought
would be relevant to compliance with clause 17 as
opposed to clause 20.  As I understand counsel for the plaintiff, the plaintiff
does not submit that clause 17 would require disclosure about the intentions of
the offeror additional to what is required by clause
20.  The legislature has
itself determined, by prescribing disclosure of the matters set out in clause
20, that those matters are
to be provided to offeree shareholders regardless of
whether the bid is for cash or scrip or is conditional or unconditional -
indeed,
regardless of whether the information would or would not otherwise be
regarded as material information.  In my opinion, clause 17
does not impose an
overriding requirement of materiality upon the other disclosure requirements in
s 750 such as clause 20. That
view emerges from the remarks of Bryson J in the
<i>Metal Manufacturers Ltd</i> case, quoted above. 
<P>

37	As to documents relating to competition issues, which are sought in
paragraphs 3 and 4 of the notices to produce, the defendants
say that
information about the state of any application to or negotiations with the
ACCC, or about any undertaking which may be given
or steps which may be taken
to secure approval, is not relevant to decisions by offeree shareholders even
though the offers are conditional
upon (in effect) ACCC `non-disapproval'.  The
defendants rely on the fact that this is a cash bid.
<P>

38	The significance of the fact that the bid is for cash rather than scrip
requires careful consideration.  There is no doubt that
this fact limits the
range of what is material.  In the <i>Aberfoyle</i> case, in the passages set
out, Finkelstein J rejected a submission that disclosure of benefits to accrue
to the offeror was material
disclosure for offeree shareholders in a cash
bid.
<P>

39	The fundamental principle was clearly articulated by Santow J in<b>
</b><i>Cultus Petroleum NL</i> at page 16:
<P>

	`A matter is material in this context if it might reasonably affect, or tend
to affect the decision of the ordinary investor whether
or not to accept the
offer in the particular circumstances of the bid;  <i>Cackett v Keswick
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%202%20Ch%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] 2 Ch 456</a> at 464.  Therefore, if a fact were omitted which, if known,
would have either tended to deter offerees from accepting the bid (<i>Re
Rossfield Group Operations Pty Ltd </i>(supra) at 376;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%205%20ACLR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 5 ACLR 237</a> at
241;  CLC 40-710 at 33,149;  <i>Carr Boyd Minerals Ltd v Queen Margaret Gold
Mines NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%207%20ACLC%201029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 7 ACLC 1029</a> at 1038, and in <i>Augold NL v Yaramin Pty Ltd

accept the bid, that fact is material.  Thus a matter is material if it `is
necessary
to enable an offeree to make an informed assessment of the offer;
<i>Australian Consolidated Investments v Rossington Holdings Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/163.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 163</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2035%20FCR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
35 FCR 226.'</a> 
<P>

40	Is it material for offeree shareholders in a cash bid which is conditional
on regulatory non-disapproval to know the state of
play in negotiations with
the regulator?  In the present application, the plaintiff relies on evidence
about the choices available
to the offeree shareholders.  In his affidavit of
10 May 1999, Mr Wayne Lonergan, a chartered  accountant specialising in
valuations
and associated financial advice, says:
<P>

	`When faced with a cash bid with a minimum acceptance condition, shareholders
have a number of different options open to them:
<P>

(a) 	they can accept the offer for all their shares;
<P>

(b) 	they can accept the offer for part of their holding;
<P>

(c) 	they can decide not to accept the offer;
<P>

(d) 	they can sell their shares on the ASX;
<P>

(e) 	they can wait in order to determine whether or not a competing bid
emerges, the offeror increases its bid or the conditions
are satisfied or
waived.'
<P>

41	As I see it, the question whether offeree shareholders are entitled to
receive information about competition matters is relevant
to that part of their
overall decision which relates to paragraph (e) in Mr Lonergan's list. If the
additional information assists
them to wait and see whether the condition is
fulfilled or another bidder emerges, it may be argued to be material
information within
clause 17.  In<b> </b><i>Gantry Acquisition Corp v Parker
&amp; Parsley Petroleum Australia Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1212.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1212</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2051%20FCR%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 51 FCR 554</a>, Sheppard J
cited King CJ's judgment in<b> </b><i>Samic Limited v Metals Exploration
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2060%20SASR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 60 SASR 300</a> to the effect that information, which could
affect the offeree shareholder's assessment of whether the offeror was likely
to improve
its bid, would be material information for disclosure in a Pt C
statement, and his Honour said it would be just as relevant for a
Part A
statement.
<P>

42	It is not necessary for me to decide in the present application whether
those observations might go too far, in view of the commonsense
approach to
disclosure advocated by Bryson J in the<b> </b><i>Metal Manufacturers</i><b>
</b>case<b>,</b> nor to determine what degree of additional disclosure would be
entailed if those observations were to be applied.  In my opinion,
it would not
be material for offeree shareholders to know the state of play in negotiations
with the ACCC or the planning which the
offeror has embarked upon with respect
to undertakings which it may offer to the ACCC or other steps which it may
exercise to secure
the ACCC's acquisition. Information of that kind would tend
to encourage speculative and unsubstantiated conclusions by offeree
shareholders,
which might well be inherently misleading but would not, in my
view, be material information  for the purposes of clause 17.  Matters
of
negotiation and planning are inherently unstable.  Counsel for the defendants
properly observed that there is an important distinction
between information of
this kind and information that a final decision has been made by the regulatory
authority.  Though in a different
context, Santow J's observations in Cultus
are readily adaptable here.
<P>

	`It may thus be going too far to state, not only is there no obligation to
disclose, but there is a positive obligation <i>not </i>to disclose in a Part A
statement matters of opinion about which minds may differ, assessments that are
based on variable assumptions
or predictions, or the assumptions or predictions
upon which those assessments are based.  The duty not to disclose such material
must depend firstly upon whether it is <i>mere</i> speculation, or instead a
prediction properly substantiated in a way which avoids that material being
misleading.  Thus, for example,
forecasts which are subject to there being `no
major deterioration' in the market or the weather (<i>Re Primac Holdings
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%2022%20ACSR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 22 ACSR 212)</a> would not represent a proper substantiation if
that were all there were, and would be potentially misleading.'
<P>

43	It follows, in my view, that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the notices to produce do
not seek relevant evidence as far as the case relates
to clause 17.  No other
basis has been put forward which would render these documents relevant. My
conclusion is that paragraphs
3 and 4 of the notices to produce, and also
paragraph 1 of the subpoena, should be struck out.  I do not think it is
appropriate
to allow an amendment to those documents which would confine them
to material which is relevant, because an instrument requiring
production of
material truly relevant to issues concerning the ACCC would be a different kind
of instrument and not merely an amendment
to the present instruments.
<P>

44	As to the paragraphs of the notices to produce relating to the briefing
notes (paragraphs 5 to 10 of the notices to produce and
paragraphs 2 to 5 of
the subpoena), in my opinion the production of these documents is relevant, if
at all, only to disclose the
intentions of the offeror for the purposes of
clause 20 of s 750 and to the question whether the disclosures contained in
paragraph
18 of the Part A statement are misleading.  Additionally, some of
those paragraphs are drafted so widely as to raise the issues addressed
by Sir
Frederick Jordan in the passage from <i>Small's</i> case set out above.  I
shall return to these matters later.
<P>

45	As to the paragraph of the notices to produce and subpoena requiring drafts
of the Part A statement (paragraph 11 of the notices
to produce and paragraph 6
of the subpoena), my opinion is that, whether they are open to attack on the
ground of irrelevance, they
clearly suffer from the deficiencies identified by
Sir Frederick Jordan in <i>Small's</i> case and I shall elaborate on this point
later.  I take the same view with respect to the requirements in the notices to
produce
concerning reports to the United Kingdom company and its subsidiaries
(paragraph 2 of the notices to produce).
<P>

	<b>Clause 20 of s 750</b>
<P>

46	The relevant parts of clause 20 deal with disclosure of the offeror's
intentions regarding continuation of the business of the
target company, any
major changes to be made to that business, and the future employment of present
employees of the target.  The
plaintiff's challenge to the adequacy of the
disclosure relates to the word `intention', and I have heard submissions with
respect
to the scope of that word.  The notices to produce proceed upon the
theory that `intentions', for the purposes of clause 20, include
contingent
intentions and intentions which are subject to further consideration and
further review .  That theory derives some support
for the decision in <i>ICAL
Limited v County Natwest Securities Australia Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2039%20NSWLR%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 39 NSWLR 214</a>,
239 where Bryson J said, with respect to an earlier version of the takeover
legislation:
<P>

	`The evidence of Mr Zegna in my view establishes in substance that, testing
matters by the test cited from <i>Cunliffe v Goodman,</i> there is an intention
to sell significant assets of the plaintiff, no less so because the intention
is not complete, unreserved and
final and there is room for further
consideration of the choice of the particular assets, and the time of sale.
There is not a number
of alternatives which ought to be disclosed;  the actual
intention ought to have been disclosed.  There was not a simple failure
to
disclose anything at all in the Pt C Statement;  the Pt statement suffers from
general obscurity but whatever it does disclose
need not be analysed with
complete rigour just because it is plain that it does not disclose the
intention which I have found existed.
<P>

	In my finding the disposition of many assets of ICAL, including Tulk, at times
sufficiently near in the future for the proceeds
to have relevance for the
arrangement for financing the take-over, was likely, with sufficient likelihood
for the disclosure to be
material to shareholders of ICAL receiving the Pt C
Statements.  Even if contingent and subject to further consideration or
possible
review, these intentions were intentions of the second defendant
regarding the continuation of the plaintiff's business and with
respect to
major changes to be made to the business of the plaintiff.'
<P>

47	The scope of s 750 clause 20 was considered more recently in the <i>Savage
Resources</i> case.  There Hely J said:
<P>

	`Where disclose is required of intentions, or of a possible course of action
under consideration, the disclosure must be specific
and clear, and not
obscured by the use of vague or indeterminate or ambiguous language.
<P>

	In <i>Gantry</i> (supra) at ACLC p 633;  FCR p 560 Sheppard J said:
<P>

	`In reaching my conclusion I have taken into account the fact that it is
particulars which cl 20 requires.  I bear in mind also
that cl 20(2) uses the
word `specify'.  Accordingly, an offeror must do the best it can to be
particular and specific about its intentions.
 Nevertheless the document is
dealing with a commercial situation.  It is being delivered in the context in
which the offeror does
not have control of the target company.  In those
circumstances it is not only reasonable, it is also necessary, for it to
express
itself in a guarded way.  If it does not do this, it runs the risk that
statements it makes may, because of their very particularity,
be found to have
been misleading.'
<P>

	The offeror's intentions have to be disclosed in regard to all possible
eventualities.  It is not sufficient to disclose what the
offeror proposes to
do if the offeror is able to ensure that its nominees constitute a majority of
the target's board.  The offeror
should also disclose its intentions in the
event that its offer becomes unconditional and insufficient acceptances are
received to
provide the offeror with board control.  <i>Stirling Resources NL v
Capital Energy NL </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%20701" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19 ACSR 701</a>;  14 ACLC 1005 at 1010;  Renard &amp;
Santamaria, <i>Takeovers and Reconstructions in Australia</i>, p 824.'
<P>

48	In the present case, paragraph 18 of the Part A statement purports to
satisfy clause 20 by making disclosure which draws a distinction
between final
decisions and intentions to explore or consider.  The notices to produce seek
documents evidencing the considerations
which have been brought to bear for the
purpose of making the disclosure contained in paragraph 18.  The relevance of
seeking disclosure
is, at least in part, that the disclosure may establish that
what is said in paragraph 18 of the Part A statement is in some way
misleading,
having regard to what the evidence in fact shows.  It, therefore, seems to me
that there is potentially relevant information
to be sought with respect to
paragraph 18 of the Part A statement and that, by and large, paragraph 1 of the
notices to produce seeks
that relevant information.
<P>

49	I have a concern which arises out of the definition of `intentions' in the
Part A statement, which applies in order to identify
the documents which are to
be produced pursuant to paragraph 1 of the notices to produce.  While Bryson
J's judgment in the <i>ICAL</i> case recognises that contingent intentions and
intentions subject to further consideration or review may be matters required
to be
disclosed by clause 20, in my opinion that proposition may not be
universally true.  A commonsense level of disclosure is to be achieved,
as
shown by Hely J's judgment in the <i>Savage Resources</i> case and his Honour's
own remarks in the <i>Metal Manufacturers</i> case.  The concept of intention
which arises out of those cases implies, to my mind, that  paragraph 1 of the
notice to produce and
especially, the definition  of `intention', may be
expressed too widely.  Since, however, my opinion is that the documents sought
by paragraph 1 of the notices are, to a substantial degree, relevant to
compliance with clause 20 and to the question of misleadingness
of the
disclosure of intentions, the proper course of action is for the Court to make
an order having the effect of limiting the
evidence required by paragraph 1 of
the notices to documents relevant to the disclosure required by clause 20 of s
750 of the Corporations
Law.
<P>

50	As to paragraphs 5 to 10 of notices and paragraphs 2 to 5 of the subpoenas,
the briefing notes for the meeting with analysts
on 3 May 1999 are broadly
expressed but a significant number of the propositions contained in the notes
relate, or may relate, to
intentions of the kinds referred to in clause
20(1)(a) and (b), and even (c).  A demand for further evidence relating to the
briefing
notes, if properly limited to the issues of compliance with clause 20
and misleadingness of disclosure about intentions, would therefore
be
permissible.  To ensure that the further evidence is properly limited to those
issues, the paragraphs of the notices and subpoena
which relate to the briefing
notes should be subject to a limiting order equivalent to the order which I
propose for paragraph 1
of the notices.  In my opinion, however, paragraphs 9
and 10 are so broadly expressed as to constitute a fishing expedition and
should
be struck out, for reasons which I shall explain later.
<P>

<b>Other grounds for challenge:  the `substitute for discovery' and `fishing
grounds'</b>
<P>

51	As I have indicated, these grounds remain part of the established law with
respect to challenges to subpoenas and notices to
produce, even in the context
of litigation such as the present.  There is a vivid comment on the way in
which litigants in takeovers
and similar matters may seek to abuse the subpoena
procedure in the judgment of Young J in <i>Hooker Investments Pty Ltd v Baring
Bros Halkerston &amp; Partners Securities Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20ACLR%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 ACLR 462</a> at
468-469.
<P>

52	While the mischief which Sir Frederick Jordan's principles seek to avoid is
clear, I am not persuaded that this mischief is present
with respect to every
paragraph of the notices to produce and subpoena.  In my opinion, it cannot be
said that the material required
in paragraph 1 of the notices to produce, if
properly related to disclosure of intentions under clause 20 of s 750, should
be regarded
as an inappropriate substitute for discovery or as a fishing
expedition.  The material in paragraph 1 refers specifically to sub-paragraphs
of the Part A statement and seeks evidence with respect to matters to which the
Part A statement expressly refers.  The briefing
notes which are in evidence
supply a reasonable ground for further investigation as to the accuracy of the
propositions about intentions
in the Part A statement.  Although the briefing
notes are expressed in quite general terms, they suggest that the offeror's
intentions
may have reached a more mature state than the Part A statement
discloses.  If that is so, not only is the material sought in paragraph
1 of
the notices relevant to contravention of clause 20 in the sense discussed
above, but it may also be relevant to a submission
that the Part A statement is
in that respect misleading.  The ground for apprehension which the briefing
notes create may evaporate
when the further evidence is obtained. It
nevertheless seems to me to be appropriate, and not a fishing expedition, for
the notices
to seek further evidence of the intentions to which paragraph 18 of
the Part A statement refers.
<P>

53	That disposes of paragraph 1 of the notices to produce. As I have already
indicated, in my opinion paragraph 2 of the notices
to produce (relating to
reports to the UK parent) is defective because it constitutes `fishing' in the
sense described by Sir Frederick
Jordan. There is no statement in paragraph 2
confining its scope to intentions of the kind to which paragraph 1 refers, nor
to relate
the reports which are sought to any other relevant ground of
challenge.  The plaintiff appears to be seeking the evidence referred
to in
paragraph 2 in order to determine, relevantly, whether it has a case rather
than to provide evidence for the plaintiff's case
as stated.  
<P>

54	I make the same observations with respect to paragraph 11 of the notices to
produce, which is also found in paragraph 6 of the
subpoena.  It seems to me
simply too  broad to seek production of all drafts of the Part A statement and
to do so is properly classified
as `fishing' in Sir Frederick Jordan's sense.
A draft of the Part A statement would not be probative of any material fact or
intention
unless there was much more material surrounding the document. There
is no such evidence here.
<P>

55	That leaves me to comment upon paragraphs 5 to 10 of the notice to produce,
part of which is found in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the
subpoena.  As previously
explained, my opinion is that evidence with respect to the briefing of 3 May
1999 and preparations for that
purpose is relevant to the issues of compliance
with clause 20 of s 750 and misleadingness with respect to intentions.  Given
that
relevance, it cannot be said that to seek disclosure of documents, to the
extent that they relate to the defendants' intentions,
would constitute a
fishing expedition or be a substitute for discovery.  However, it appears that
the notices require evidence going
beyond disclosure of material justifiable by
reference to clause 20 of s 750. One cannot review and amend the paragraphs
under consideration
with surgical precision.  It seems to me accurate enough to
say that paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the notices to produce are properly
drawn
as material relevant to the question of the intentions, not constituting a
fishing expedition, but that paragraphs 9 and 10
are far too wide to be
justified in that way.  In the subpoena paragraphs 2 to 5 are supportable in
the same manner as paragraphs
5-8 of the notices.
<P>

	<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

56	It follows in my opinion that:
<P>

(i) 	paragraph 1 of the notices to produce survives the defendants' challenge
but an order should be made limiting its scope so
that the production of
evidence under that paragraph is confined to evidence relevant to the
disclosure of intentions required by
the clause 20 of s 750;
<P>

(ii) 	paragraphs 2 and 11 of the notices to produce and paragraph 6 of the
subpoena should be struck out on the ground that they
would constitute
`fishing';
<P>

(iii) 	paragraphs 3 and 4 should be struck out on the ground that they do not
seek the production of documents relevant to any issue
likely to be raised in
these proceedings;  
<P>

(iv) 	paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the notices to produce and paragraphs 2, 3, 4
and 5 of the subpoena survive the challenge provided
they are subject to the
same qualification as paragraph 1 of the notices, limiting the scope of
production to matters required to
be disclosed by clause 20 of s 750;
<P>

(v) 	paragraphs 9 and 10 of the notices to produce are couched in terms which
are too wide and constitute fishing and should, therefore,
be struck out.
<P>

57	I am inclined to order that the costs of the application be costs of the
proceedings, but I will allow the parties to address
me on that question.  I
shall stand the matter down in today's list to enable the parties to bring in
short minutes of orders which
will reflect my conclusions.
<P>
