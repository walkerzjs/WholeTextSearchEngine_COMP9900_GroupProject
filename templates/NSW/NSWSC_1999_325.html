<b><u>4120/98 DAVID WILKIE WATSON v STUART WILKIE WATSON &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>General Outline</b>
<P>

1	The question for decision is whether a gift of personalty under a will,
subject to a condition which has not been fulfilled, results
in that personalty
going to the donee free of the condition, to the persons entitled to residue,
or to those persons entitled under
a gift over on non-fulfilment of the
condition.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2	Harold Douglas Watson died on 16 October 1997, leaving a will dated 21 August
1997, probate of which was granted to two of his
sons, David Wilkie Watson
(David), the plaintiff, and Stuart Wilkie Watson (Stuart), the first defendant,
on 9 February 1998.  While
the liabilities in the estate are not known the
estimated value of the assets shown in the inventory of property was in excess
of
$3.2 million.  Included in the assets are 17550 shares in Wilkie Watson
Publications Pty. Limited (Wilkie Watson) with an estimated
value of $1 614
600.  
<P>

3	At the date of death of the deceased there were 35,050 issued shares in
Wilkie Watson.  17,500 of these were and are held by David,
the balance being
held by the deceased.  The Watson family has been engaged in the newspaper
publication business for three generations.
 Wilkie Watson was formed by the
deceased in about 1966.  It published the Tumut &amp; Adelong Times and the
Tumbarumba Times.  The
deceased, his wife and his four sons had been
shareholders over the years.  Over a time three of the sons left the business
and ceased
to be directors.  Stuart ceased to be a shareholder in 1975 when he
purchased another newspaper 'The Junee Southern Cross'.  Later
he established
an additional business known as 'Tumut Office Supplies'.  It seems that it was
always his father's wish to have him
back in his business, but there were
problems between David and Stuart.  There were negotiations in 1994 as to the
terms on which
Stuart might come back in to Wilkie Watson, bringing his two
businesses in with him, but that did not come to fruition.  
<P>

4	The shareholdings between the deceased and David were equal from 1 July 1997
to 15 September 1997, on which later date the deceased
allotted to himself 50
additional shares.  David was not told this.  The deceased was governing
director of the company and had the
total control of it vested in him in his
lifetime.
<P>

5	The will of the deceased, so far as is relevant for the determination of the
questions here, was as follows except for the insertion
by me of the capital
letters in square brackets, which are relevant to questions raised in the
summons:
<P>

<u>THIS IS THE LAST WILL</u> of me <u>HAROLD DOUGLAS WATSON</u> of 106 Dalhunty
Street, Tumut in the State of New South Wales, Publisher.
<P>

1.		<u>I HEREBY REVOKE</u> all former Wills made by me and declare this to be
my last Will.
<P>

2.		<u>I HEREBY APPOINT</u> my sons <u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u> and <u>DAVID
WILKIE WATSON</u> (hereinafter called "my Trustees") Executors and Trustees of
this my Will <u>AND I DECLARE</u> that all trusts and powers herein vested in
my Trustees may be exercised by the survivor of them or other the Trustee or
Trustees
for the time being of this my Will.
<P>

3.	<b>[A]</b>	<u>I GIVE AND BEQUEATH</u> my shares in <u>WILKIE WATSON
PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u> to my son <u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u> <u>SUBJECT
TO</u> and conditional upon the following:
<P>

<b>[B]</b>	(a)	That the business of <u>TUMUT OFFICE SUPPLIES</u> and the
<u>JUNEE  SOUTHERN CROSS</u> presently operated by <u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u>
be incorporated into and form part of <u>WILKIE WATSON PUBLICATIONS PTY.
LTD.</u> at the valuation figure or as agreed between <u>STUART WILKIE
WATSON</u> and <u>WILKIE WATSON PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u>
<P>

<b>[C] </b>Should this condition not be fulfilled then Clause 6 hereof shall
apply and the shares referred to in this clause shall <strike>form part of the
residue of my estate and</strike> be dealt with in accordance with Clause 6 of
this my Will.
<P>

<b>[D] </b><u>I DIRECT THAT</u> <u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u> be appointed a
Director of <u>WILKIE WATSON PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u> /with David Wilkie
Watson as Chairman of Directors/ and further that <u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u>
and <u>DAVID WILKIE WATSON</u> be employed by and work within <u>WILKIE WATSON
PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD</u>.<b>[E]</b> <u>AND I EXPRESS</u> the wish that no
further shareholders be admitted to <u>WILKIE WATSON PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u>
without the consent and agreement of all shareholders and that no shares be
sold outside the family unless by consent and agreement
of all shareholders.
<P>

4.		<u>I FORGIVE</u> any loan owing by <u>DAVID WILKIE WATSON</u> to me at the
date of my death and <u>I FORGIVE</u> any loan owing by <u>STUART WILKIE
WATSON</u> to me at the date of my death.
<P>

5.		<u>I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH</u> unto my Trustees all my rest and residue
of my Estate <u>UPON TRUST</u> to pay thereout all my just debts funeral and
testamentary expenses and all duties associated with the administration of my
Estate
and to hold the balance then remaining for my sons <u>GREGORY ROY WILKIE
WATSON</u> and <u>MARK WILKIE WATSON</u> in equal shares absolutely <u>PROVIDED
THAT</u> in the event of any such son or sons predeceasing me leaving a child
or children who survive me such grandchild shall take and if
more than one in
equal shares the share that my own son would have taken had he survived me.
<P>

6.	<b>[F]</b>	<u>I DIRECT</u> that if the beneficiary of the shares referred to
in Clause 3 hereof is unable to work with <u>DAVID WILKIE WATSON</u> or if
there should be complete disagreement in relation to the operation of the
Company <u>WILKIE WATSON PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u> within three (3) months of
the date of my death and should the businesses of <u>TUMUT OFFICE SUPPLIES</u>
and <u>JUNEE SOUTHERN CROSS</u> have been incorporated into <u>WILKIE WATSON
PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u> such businesses shall be transferred back to
<u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u> at the same value at which they were incorporated
into <u>WILKIE WATSON PUBLICATIONS PTY. LTD.</u> and then<b>[G]</b> the shares
referred to in Clause 3 are to be offered for sale at a price no less than the
price set or approved by the Accountant/Auditor
of the Company <u>AND I
EXPRESS</u> the wish that the shares be first offered for sale to a shareholder
or member of the family at the price set or approved by the Accountant/Auditor.
Should no shareholder or member of the family wish to purchase the shares, the
shares shall be offered for sale on the market by
open tender.  The proceeds of
sale are to be distributed amongst my sons <u>GREGORY ROY WILKIE WATSON</u>,
<u>STUART WILKIE WATSON</u>, <u>DAVID WILKIE WATSON</u> and <u>MARK WILKIE
WATSON</u> in equal shares absolutely <u>PROVIDED THAT</u> in the event of any
son or sons predeceasing me leaving a child or children who survive me such
grandchild shall take and if more
than one in equal shares the share that my
own son would have taken had he survived me.
<P>

6	After the death of the testator, David was left the sole director, but he
appointed his wife as an additional director on 25 November
1997.
<P>

7	The businesses of Tumut Office Supplies and Junee Southern Cross have not
been incorporated into Wilkie Watson.  Stuart wrote
to David on 16 December
1997 saying that he was in a position to transfer his two businesses and
suggested a value of $140 000 for
Junee Southern Cross and $5000 plus stock at
valuation for Tumut Office Supplies.  David responded asking for a full set of
financial
figures for a period of five years.  That drew a response from Stuart
which was later confirmed, indicating that he did not expect
payment and
thought that valuations were needed for accounting purposes only.  David has
given evidence that he does not consider
there is any advantage to Wilkie
Watson acquiring the two businesses, whether for consideration or no
consideration, as in his view
they do not fit well together.  He is in
effective control of the company at the present time so that unless Stuart is
entitled to
immediate transfer of the 17050 shares of the deceased the
condition as to incorporation of his businesses into Wilkie Watson will
not be
fulfilled.
<P>

<b>Questions for determination</b>
<P>

8.	The summons has identified various parts of Clauses 3 and 6 the will by the
letters [A] to [G].  These have been included in
the copy of the relevant
provisions of the will which I have set out.  In brief the questions for
determination are:
<P>

A.	Whether the gift of shares to Stuart is dependent upon the performance of
[B] alone or [B] together with either or both of [D]
and [E].
<P>

B.	Whether the gift is subject to a condition and if so whether it is a
condition precedent or a condition subsequent.
<P>

C.	Whether the condition is void for uncertainty.
<P>

D.	Whether the gift is valid but subject to failure if it is not performed
within a certain time, or if agreement is not reached
for a transfer of
business.
<P>

E.	Whether the will imposes any obligations on Wilkie Watson in relation to
deciding about the acquisition of the businesses owned
by Stuart.
<P>

F.	If the condition is void or fails to be performed, what is the result.  
<P>

9	It is necessary to deal with these matters in turn and then to answer the
specific questions in the summons.
<P>

<b>Whether the gift is dependent on the performance of a condition and if so
what?</b>
<P>

10	It is, I consider, clear that the gift is subject to a condition.  The
wording of the will makes it quite clear.  It is, I think,
equally clear that
the condition is that incorporated in [B] namely the condition as to
incorporation of Tumut Office Supplies and
Junee Southern Cross into Wilkie
Watson and that alone.  The words immediately thereafter "should this condition
not be fulfilled"
make this apparent.  The directions that Stuart be appointed
a director of Wilkie Watson and that he and David both work within that
company
and that no further shareholders be admitted without the consent of all
shareholders and no shares be sold outside the family,
are not given in terms
appropriate to a conditional gift.
<P>

<b>Is the condition as to incorporation of businesses a condition precedent or
a condition subsequent?</b>
<P>

11	The classic texts all include discussion on whether a condition is
subsequent or precedent.  See Theobald on Wills 14th Ed 623;
Jarman on Wills
8th Ed 1458; Williams on Wills 7th Ed. 325.  The law of course favours early
vesting, but nevertheless all writers
agree that it is necessary to establish
the intention of the testator as indicated by the words in the will:
<b><cite>Egerton v Earl Brownlow</cite></b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1853/885.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1853] EngR 885</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281853%29%204%20HLCas%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1853) 4 HLC 1</a> at 157.
<P>

12	There are some matters which would indicate the condition as being a
condition precedent; some that it is a condition subsequent.
 If there is no
basis for decision, then a presumption in favour of early vesting applies:
<b><cite>Hickling v Fair</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%20AC%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] AC 15</a>; <b><cite>Sifton v
Sifton</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%20AC%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] AC 656</a> at 676.
<P>

13	Those factors which point towards the condition being precedent include:
<P>

a.	The layout of that part of Clause 3 of the will within [A] [B] and [C].
<P>

b.	The words "SUBJECT TO" and the words in [C] are indicative of a
pre-condition:  <b><cite>Re Emson; Grain v Grain</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281905%29%2093%20LT%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1905) 93 LT
104.</a>
<P>

c.	The property, namely shares, can be enjoyed without immediate performance of
the condition.
<P>

d.	The requirement for incorporation of the two businesses into Wilkie Watson,
is somewhat akin to a requirement of consideration
on the part of Stuart,
albeit perhaps consideration on the part of Wilkie Watson, as well.  The giving
of consideration for a gift
points to a condition being precedent:
<b><cite>Acherley v Vernon</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281739%29%201%20Willes%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1739) 1 Willes 153.</a>
<P>

e.	No period of delay is involved before entitlement to an interest in
possession is acquired as opposed to a deferred interest
in possession in
realty, after various life estates, conditional upon a name and arms clause:
see for example <b><cite>In Re Greenwood, Goodhart v Woodhead</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1903%5d%201%20Ch%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1903]
1 Ch 749.</a>
<P>

14	Factors which might point to the condition being subsequent are:
<P>

a.	That the condition could not be fulfilled by act of the donee alone.
<P>

b.	The condition could not be fulfilled without some lapse of time.
<P>

15	The words in [D] together with Clause 6 could be thought to point either
way, but on balance I think they favour a condition
precedent finding.  That is
because the words in [F] presuppose fulfilment and thus entitlement being
vested subject to divesting
in the events set out in [F], the provisions in [G]
then applying.  The words "and then" are significant in this regard.  Perhaps
more significant is the fact that the only words in Clause 6 which could be
acted upon in accordance with the words in [C] are the
words in [G].
<P>

16	After consideration of all these matters and reading the will many times I
have come to the conclusion that the condition is
a condition precedent.  There
is more in the will to support that than to support a finding of a condition
subsequent, and I consider
that a normal reading of paragraph 3 as a whole
points to that being the proper interpretation.  In fact I consider that any
non-lawyer
reading Clause 3 would be amazed at a suggestion that Stuart was
entitled to transfer of the shares before fulfilment of the condition.
<P>

<b>Is the condition void for uncertainty?</b>
<P>

17	The grounds on which it is said that the condition might be void are first
that there is no time fixed for its performance, and
second that there is no
appropriate provision made as to the method of valuation of the shares because
the words "at the valuation
figure" do not in themselves establish a figure or
establish a method of valuation.
<P>

18	So far as the time factor is concerned, if there is no time fixed for
fulfilment of the condition, then it seems it must be fulfilled
within a
reasonable time. That seems to have been decided in the interesting case of
<b><cite>Davies v Lowndes</cite></b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1835/643.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1835] EngR 643</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1835%201%20Bing%20NC%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1835 1 Bing NC 597</a> at 618, and more
recently in <b><cite>Miller v Miller</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2016%20ACSR%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 16 ACSR 73</a> at 79 and see
Jarman on Wills 8th Ed 1466.  It would not be a sensible reading of paragraph
[C] to allow Stuart his whole life to
fulfil the condition as he also takes
under the gift over.  Here also, as the concurrence of Wilkie Wilson is needed,
a reasonable
time to obtain this would be implied for performance.  I would
have thought that one year after the death of the testator or at most
one year
after the grant of probate would be a reasonable time and that time has now
passed.  So far as the second point is concerned,
while the words "at the
valuation figure" may be uncertain, there is no doubt that there could have
been agreement between Stuart
and the company as to the figure at which the
businesses would be incorporated into the company, and if that were done there
would
be no uncertainty and the condition could have been fulfilled.  In other
words, if there were agreement then there would be certainty,
provided
incorporation took place within a reasonable time.  The gift is therefore not
void for uncertainty, although I accept it
might have been had the condition
been subsequent. 
<P>

<b>Does the gift fail through non-fulfilment of the condition?</b>
<P>

19	As the condition has not been fulfilled because incorporation has not taken
place within a reasonable time, and because there
has been no agreement as to
the value at which the business is to be incorporated, or for that matter
whether or not it will be incorporated
at all, the gift must fail.  In other
words the gift is subject to a condition precedent which has failed through
non-performance.
 The will cannot impose any obligation on Wilkie Wilson so far
as the compliance or reasonable behaviour is concerned.
<P>

<b>What is the result of the failure?</b>
<P>

20	Non-fulfilment of the condition brings the words in [C] and Clause 6 of the
will into operation.  The result of this will be
that the four sons of the
deceased will, upon sale of the shares in accordance with the provisions of
that clause, take the proceeds
of sale in equal shares.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

21	Having regard to the particular contest between the trustees, namely the
plaintiff and the first defendant, it is not appropriate
for any party to have
costs on an indemnity basis.  Subject to that the costs of all parties should
be paid out of the estate.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

22	It follows that the questions in paragraph 1 of the summons should be
answered as follows:
<P>

1.	(1)	(a)	Yes
<P>

	(2)	(a)	Yes
<P>

		(b)	(i)	A condition precedent
<P>

			(ii)	No
<P>

			(iii)	(I)	A reasonable time which has passed.
<P>

				(II)	Yes
<P>

				(III)	No
<P>

			(iv)	Does not apply
<P>

			(v)	(I)	Yes
<P>

				(II)	No
<P>

				(III)	No
<P>

	Order the costs of the plaintiff and the defendants be paid out of the estate
of the deceased.
<P>

I certify that paragraphs <b>1 to 22</b> are a true copy of the Reasons for

<b>WINDEYER J  </b>

<b>TUESDAY 20 APRIL 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>4120/98 - DAVID WILKIE WATSON v STUART WILKIE WATSON - ESTATE OF HAROLD
DOUGLAS WATSON &amp; 2 ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   The final question to be decided in this action  is the
question of costs.  In my judgment delivered on  14 April
1999, I indicated
that the costs should be paid out  of the estate.  I was asked not to make that
order to enable  there to be further
argument on this question which has taken
place this morning.
<P>

2	In ordinary circumstances, irrespective of the  provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 93(3)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a>, the  costs which are incurred in the estate as a
result of doubt  or ambiguity arising under the wording of a will would be
payable
out of residue unless there were some clause in the  will setting up a
particular fund out of which testamentary  expenses were to
be paid.  In this
estate, under the clear  wording of the will, the testamentary expenses are to
be paid  out of residue.  Clause
5 of the will so provides.  It is after those
expenses have been paid that the balance of  residue is to be distributed
between the
two residuary  beneficiaries. 
<P>

3	Counsel for the plaintiff, the plaintiff being one of  the trustees, says,
first, that the costs should be paid on  an indemnity
basis and that, as I
understand it, extends of the  costs of all parties.  Second, that the costs
should be  borne, as I understood
it, rateably between the fund and the
residue, but in any event, not entirely borne by residue or  by the fund,
because that would
throw an unfair burden either  way.
<P>

4	Counsel for the first defendant, who is also a trustee,  accepts that if the
ordinary rule were followed that might bring about
an unfair result, in this
case particularly, because to some extent it could not be said that it was not
adversary  litigation among
the parties.
<P>

5	Counsel for the residuary beneficiaries, while pressing  for an order that
the costs should be borne by the fund, in the alternative
says that the costs
should be borne by the  parties rateably in accordance with their shares in the
estate, or in the alternative
that each party should pay his  own costs.
<P>

6	There can be no doubt that this litigation was brought about by the most
unfortunate drafting of the will of the deceased.  None
of the parties is
responsible for that and to  that extent the litigation, while to some extent
adverse, is  not brought about by
them.  In those circumstances, I do not
think it would be appropriate to make an order that would have the result of
the parties
paying their own costs.  Neither do I think it would be appropriate
to make any order  under which any of the parties receive costs
on an indemnity
basis out of the estate.  In ordinary circumstances the residuary beneficiaries
would not be entitled to such an
order and in view of the  separate interests
being contended for by the trustees, in  this litigation, I do not think they
should
be entitled to  such an order.  As the common fund basis no longer
exists and there is little distinction between that and the costs
which  will
be allowed under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a>, in my view,  no order as to
indemnity costs should be made.
<P>

7	Both trustees accept that it would produce an unfair  result to cast the
total burden of the costs on the residuary beneficiaries.
 Thus, while I have
no doubt that if it were  not for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">s93(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a>, the law would
require that order to be made.  I think it would be appropriate to make a
special order in this case so that the 
parties will bear the costs rateably in
proportion to their interests in the estate.  It would seem, therefore, that
the  appropriate
order be that the costs be paid out of the estate  but borne
out of the beneficiaries rateably in accordance  with their interests.
 That
would enable the costs to be  payable now, but adjusted later.
<P>

8	I should add that I have also been asked to make an order that further
consideration be reserved in case there is any difficulty
arising or question
arising on the sale of the shares and I am prepared to make that order.
<P>

9	Finally, I should say that in my view questions of costs ought to be argued
at the trial because it would have taken  very little
time to have had this
argument while the construction proceedings were on foot and that could have
saved the additional expense which
has now been incurred.   
<P>

ORDER
<P>

10	The cost of the parties to be paid out of the estate, but  borne by the
parties rateably in proportion to their shares in the
estate.  The rateable
allocation should take place on the actual value of the benefits received by
each beneficiary.  Those proportionate
benefits to be calculated before the
costs of these proceedings are deducted from the funds of the estate.
