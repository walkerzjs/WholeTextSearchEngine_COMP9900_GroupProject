<u>30107/98  -  Robert HAMILTON &amp; ANOR v THE CONSUMER CLAIMS</u>
<P>

<u>TRIBUNAL OF NEW SOUTH WALES &amp; ANOR</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In these proceedings, relief in the nature of
that which can be granted by way of prerogative writ is sought in
relation to a
decision of the Consumer Claims Tribunal given under the <b><i>Consumer Claims
Tribunals Act 1987</i></b> (the Act).
<P>

2   	The Consumer Claims Tribunal is an inferior court, not an
administrative tribunal.  The distinction in Australia is an important
one.  In
<b><i>Craig v The State of South Australia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 163</a>, Brennan,
Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ emphasised the distinction at pp 175-6,
describing the scope of a writ of certiorari
as follows:
<P>

<i>"Where the writ runs, it merely enables the quashing of the impugned order
or decision upon one or more of a number of distinct established
grounds, most
importantly, jurisdictional error, failure to observe some applicable
requirement of procedural fairness, fraud and
`error of law on the face of the
record'."</i>
<P>

3   	At p 177, the Court described the limited aspects of a
decision of a Court which would amount to jurisdictional error.  For
example,
the Court said:
<P>

<i>"Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court
will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of
the writ where it makes
an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it
lacks, or refuses to exercise,
jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken
assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the
nature or
limits of jurisdiction."</i>
<P>

4   	The approach in relation to a court was contrasted with
that in relation to an administrative tribunal.  At p 179 the Court
said:
<P>

<i>"If such an administrative tribunal falls into an error of law which causes
it to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong question,
to ignore
relevant material, to rely on irrelevant material or, at least in some
circumstances, to make an erroneous finding or to
reach a mistaken conclusion,
and the tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected,
it exceeds its authority
or powers.  Such an error of law is jurisdictional
error which will invalidate any order or decision of the tribunal which
reflects
it."</i>
<P>

5   	The distinction has been discarded in the United Kingdom;
however, the principles enunciated in <b><i>Craig v The State of South
Australia</i></b><i> </i>find partial expression in s 12 of the Act which
provides, inter alia:
<P>

<i>(1)	Except as provided by subsection (2), a court of record has no
jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari
or other prerogative writ,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a declaratory judgment or order, or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	an injunction,</i>
<P>

<i>in respect of a consumer claim heard and determined or to be heard or
determined by a tribunal in accordance with this Act or in respect
of any
ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such a claim.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) if, in respect of a consumer
claim:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	...</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a tribunal has made an order under section 30 and the ground on which
the relief or remedy is sought is that:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	in relation to the hearing or determination of the claim, a party to
the claim had been denied natural justice.</i>
<P>

6   	Section 12 limits the jurisdiction of this Court to grant
relief even more severely than does the Common Law.  It is not a
ground of
relief that there is an error of law on the face of the record.  The only two
grounds are jurisdiction and breach of natural
justice.
<P>

7   	The decision of the Tribunal was that the plaintiffs, Mr
and Mrs Hamilton, pay a sum of $14,060, a balance found to be due
to Warrington
Homes Pty Ltd, a builder which had constructed a home for Mr and Mrs
Hamilton.
<P>

8   	The first ground of attack is that the Tribunal had no
jurisdiction to hear and determine the complaint before it.  Section
32 of the
Act provides, inter alia:
<P>

<i>(1)	A tribunal has no jurisdiction to make in respect of a particular
consumer claim an order or orders in favour of the claimant
or, where there are
2 or more claimants, in favour of those claimants if the total of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the amount or amounts (if any) of money to be paid,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the value or values (if any) of the work to be performed, or the
services to be supplied,</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the amount or amounts (if any) of money to be declared not to be due or
owing, and</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the value or values of goods (if any) to be delivered or
replaced,</i>
<P>

<i>under or by virtue of the order or orders would exceed the prescribed
amount.</i>
<P>

The prescribed amount was $25,000.
<P>

9   	The claim lodged by the builder specified two sets of
items, one of additional items being an unpaid total of $20,558, and
the other
of unpaid construction variations having a total of $22,328.  The two sums
totalled $42,886.  Handwritten on the last page
of the claim were the words,
<i>"We are limiting this claim to $25,000 if heard by the Consumer Claims
Tribunal"</i>.
<P>

10   	Counsel for Mr and Mrs Hamilton, Mr M Cohen, referred to
the words <i>"the total of"</i> in s 32 and submitted that the total was
$42,886 and that the Consumer Claims Tribunal had no express or implied power
to allow a
claimant to abandon that part of the claim which exceeded the
prescribed amount.
<P>

11   	In my opinion, the Consumer Claims Tribunal had
jurisdiction as the sum claimed was within the jurisdictional limit,
notwithstanding
that the elements making up the claim may have exceeded that
sum.
<P>

12   	In a recent case, <b><i>Batshon v Elias &amp; Ors</i></b>
(unreported, 3 June 1999), I dealt with an analogous issue.  I there referred
to the definition of a <i>"consumer claim"</i> under s 3 of the Act and of a
<i>"building claim" </i>under s 12A of the Act, both of which included the
words <i>"the payment of a specified sum of money".</i>  I went on to say:
<P>

<i>"Wide and general words are used in the definition of `consumer claim' and
of `building claim'.  It is therefore not surprising that
the words `a specific
sum of money' which appear in those definitions have been given a wide reading.
In <b>W D &amp; H O Wills Australia Ltd v Consumer Claims Tribunal (NSW) &amp;
Anor</b> (unreported, Court of Appeal, 23 July 1998), the term was held to
encompass a claim for a specified, that is, nominated sum, notwithstanding
that
the amount was claimed by way of unliquidated damages.  Similarly in <b>Hales v
Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ASC%2055%2d985" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ASC 55-985</a> and in <b>Sandford v
Marjen Building Contractors Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20ASC%2056%2d148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) ASC 56-148</a> the term was held to
encompass a net sum due after taking into account items on both sides of the
ledger.</i>
<P>

<i>It matters not that the quantum of the various issues to be considered
exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Tribunal, $25,000,
provided that the
sum that is sought in the claim is within the jurisdictional limit.  This was
made clear by Allen J in <b>Hales</b> when his Honour said at 58,855:</i>
<P>

<i>`It is apparent, therefore, that the jurisdiction is related to the nature
of the relief sought by the consumer rather than the cause
of action upon which
that claim was founded.'</i>
<P>

<i>In <b>Sandford</b> Grove J said at page 57,451:</i>
<P>

<i>`The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is, as the provisions I have set out show,
limited by the order it can make not by the value of
the ingredients of the
dispute from which proceedings originated.'</i>
<P>

<i>It follows that a claim must specify a sum which is within the
jurisdictional limit of the Tribunal; but it matters not that the value
of the
elements making up the claim may exceed the jurisdictional limit of $25,000, if
that sum is within the jurisdictional limit.
 As Stein JA, with whom Mason P
and Meagher JA agreed, in <b>Wills</b> said at page 8:</i>
<P>

<i>`It [the claim] has to be for the payment of a specified sum of money.  The
requirement is satisfied if a sum of money is specified
in the claim and is
within the jurisdictional limit of the Tribunal.'</i>
<P>

<i>In <b>Archcom Limited v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Ors</b></i>,<i>
(unreported, Administrative Law Division, 29/9/95) Simpson J made the same
point when her Honour said at page 16:</i>
<P>

<i>`Whether jurisdiction exists must be determined by reference to the `claim'
made by the claimant ... `Claim' is to be equated with
what is asserted by the
claimant; that is what the claimant, rightly or wrongly asserts.  Jurisdiction
depends upon the correct analysis
of the assertion made by the claimant in the
claim form.'</i>
<P>

<i>Provided that a claim asserts on its face a building claim as defined, and
provided that the sum specified in the claim is within
the jurisdictional
limit, the Tribunal will have jurisdiction."</i>
<P>

13   	In that case, it was held that the Consumer Claims
Tribunal had jurisdiction where a claim, as it was in this case, was made
up of
credits and debits but the sum of which payment was sought was $25,000 or less.
In the present case, the sum specified as the
sum of which payment was sought
was within the prescribed limit.  That ground of attack therefore fails.
<P>

14   	The other ground taken is that the Tribunal failed to
accord natural justice to Mr and Mrs Hamilton.  The affidavit of Mr
Hamilton
annexed five progress claims which showed no sum against the item
<i>"Variations"</i>.  A letter dated 18 May 1998 from the builder to Mr and Mrs
Hamilton, which was also attached to the affidavit, annexed a list of
variations which totalled $22,328, which was one part of the total items
claimed in the proceedings before the Tribunal.
<P>

15   	Mr Hamilton said in his affidavit that he had informed the
Tribunal that the claim for extras and the variations had been
neither
authorised nor agreed.  In that respect, Mr Hamilton referred to a paragraph of
the contract which required that variations
be signed by the contractor and the
owner.  By way of example of Mr Hamilton's affidavit, I set out para 4:
<P>

<i>"During the hearing before the Defendant Tribunal, I made submissions to the
Referee that, <b>in respect of the alleged variations claimed by
Warrington</b>, Warrington had failed to comply with its obligations under
clause 11 the Building Contract and also Section 10 Home <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/" class="autolink_findacts">Building Act</a>, in that
it had never inform us of the variations prior to commencing the work, had
never submitted to us any quotation, estimate
or account for the work prior to
commencing the work and had never obtained any consent, written or oral, to
carry out those works.
 By failing to provide this notice, my wife and I were
denied the opportunity of deciding whether to have the variations carried
out,
or to otherwise negotiate or quantify the costing for the work.  I also
submitted to the Referee that much of the work claimed
to be variations by
Warrington, was in fact work which was included in the base contract price for
the dwelling."</i>
<P>

16   	The matters referred to in Mr Hamilton's affidavit were
only a part of the material before the Tribunal.  No attempt has been
made by
either party to set out the material on which the Tribunal's finding, that
there were fourteen extras, seven deductions and
two credits, as specified and
valued by the Tribunal, was based.  Mr Hamilton's affidavit raised no specific
matter of procedure
about which complaint was made.  It was not suggested that,
in the course of the hearing, Mr and Mrs Hamilton were taken by surprise
or
were not given an opportunity to say all that they wished to say.
<P>

17   	The case as put by Mr Cohen for the plaintiffs was that
the reasons of the Tribunal were deficient in that they failed to
discuss the
issues, including the significance of clause 11 of the Building Contract, and
that it was impossible to determine from
the reasons for decision what was the
basis upon which the Tribunal came to its findings.
<P>

18   	Mr Cohen referred to <b><i>State Rail Authority of New
South Wales v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 473</a> in
which it was held that the Consumer Claims Tribunal was a court exercising
judicial power in disputes arising under contracts
for the supply of goods and
services.  Mr Cohen relied upon the words of Hope JA at p 479 where his Honour
said:
<P>

<i>"As appears from these provisions and from the decision in <b>Cachia v
Isaacs</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20366" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 366</a>, the tribunal must resolve issues which are in
dispute, and must keep a record of those issues as well as a record of its
decision
upon them.  Despite the power given to the tribunal to decide to make
orders which are fair and equitable, including orders other
than for the
payment of money (although in due course the claimant may be forced back to
such an order), the tribunal cannot fix
the amounts of the payments or
determine the nature of the other acts to be performed otherwise than on the
basis of the evidence
before it and the contractual rights and obligations of
the parties; the tribunal does not exercise `palm-tree justice'.  It is a
court
exercising judicial power, with the duties upon it and the consequences to the
parties that such a power and the exercise of
it involves.  It is a
jurisdiction which can, within its prescribed limits, be regarded as a
jurisdiction of a court to resolve issues
arising under contracts for the
supply of goods or services."</i>
<P>

19   	Despite the submissions of Mr Dwyer, counsel for the
builder, to the contrary, I agree with Mr Cohen that one cannot tell
from the
reasons for decision what was the basis upon which liability was found.  I
assume that the Tribunal found that the extras
and variations were authorised
and that the builder was entitled to succeed on a quantum merit: see
<b><i>Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 221.</a>
Nevertheless, the reasons simply disclose the Tribunal's ultimate findings, not
the reasons for them.  The reasons do not satisfy
the tests discussed in many
cases, clearly for example in <b><i>Mifsud v Campbell</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2021%20NSWLR%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 21 NSWLR
725.</a>
<P>

20   	Notwithstanding the direction given by s 34A of the Act,
that the reasons for decision should be <i>"as brief as is reasonably
practicable in the particular case"</i>, I think it is important in the
interests of justice that the parties should be able to understand from the
reasons for the decision
what were the basic findings of fact on which the
decision was based and on what principles of law liability was found.
<P>

21   	Mr Cohen submitted that, in the circumstances, the
Tribunal had not provided justice in the sense described by Hope JA in
the
passage I have set out above.  He submitted that the Tribunal had failed to
provide natural justice to Mr and Mrs Hamilton.
<P>

22   	In my opinion, s 12 of the Act does not extend to a case
such as the present.  A failure to give adequate reasons has been
held in many
cases to be an error of law, and in circumstances where there is jurisdiction
to set aside a decision on such a ground,
decisions have been set aside for
lack of reasons.  But the issue in the present case is not whether there was
any error of law,
for that is not a ground specified in s 12(2)(b) of the Act.
The question is whether there was a failure to accord natural justice
to Mr and
Mrs Hamilton.
<P>

23   	In my opinion, the words <i>"natural justice"</i> relate
to procedural fairness.  The reasons for decision on the other hand go to the
substance of the case.  A failure to give reasons
is held to be an error of law
because it is tied up with the question as to whether an error of law exists in
the decision.  Courts
consider that adequate reasons should be given so that
the parties may understand the decision and so that an appellate court or
a
court of judicial review may determine whether or not the decision erred in
law.
<P>

24   	Procedural fairness, however, is concerned with a
different matter; it is concerned with giving the parties a fair go in the
hearing, enabling them to understand what are the issues to which they should
direct their attention, and giving them a fair opportunity
to put their
case.
<P>

25   	The view which I have just expressed was also expressed by
Simpson J in <b><i>Archcom Pty Ltd v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp;
Ors</i></b><i> (unreported, 29 September 1995)</i>, where her Honour discussed
a similar issue.  Her Honour said:
<P>

"<i>There is some authority for the proposition that the obligation to give
reasons is an incident of the obligation to accord natural
justice: <b>Xuereb v
Viola</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWR%20453" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWR 453</a> at 469, per Cole J.</i>
<P>

<i>But the rules of natural justice are more traditionally seen as two in
number - the 'audi alteram partem' (requiring that an opportunity
to be heard
be given), and the 'bias rule' requiring the decision maker to be disinterested
or unbiased in the matter to be decided.
 More recently, a 'no evidence rule'
has made its appearance: see Allars: <b>Introduction to Australian
Administrative Law</b>, Butterworths, 1990 at p 236.</i>
<P>

<i>That failure to give reasons, or adequate reasons, where there is an
obligation to do so, can constitute an error of law is no new
proposition:
<b>Pettit v Dunkley</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20NSWLR%20376" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 NSWLR 376</a>; <b>Housing Commission of NSW v
Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%203%20NSWLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 3 NSWLR 378</a> at 385, see the cases there
cited; <b>Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247.</a>
Whether that failure is an error of law constituting a denial of natural
justice is far less certain.  In <b>Soulemezis</b>, McHugh J noted that there
were at least three purposes for the giving of reasons for a judicial decision.
The first was to enable
the parties to see the extent to which their arguments
had been understood and accepted as well as the basis of the judge's decision;
the second was in the interest of furthering judicial accountability; and the
third concerned the formulation of rules for application
in future cases.  None
of these is concerned with the principles of natural justice as traditionally
seen, and as were, I think,
envisaged by the legislature in enacting s
12(1)(b).  In <b>Public Service Board of NSW v Osmond</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20159%20CLR%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 159 CLR 656</a>, a
case concerned with the obligation of administrative decision makers to give
reasons, Gibbs CJ on two occasions drew a distinction
between the requirement
of the rules of natural justice that a person affected by a decision be given
an opportunity to be heard
and the communication of reasons for a decision once
reached (p 663, p 666).</i>
<P>

<i>I do not think the authorities are such as to warrant a conclusion that the
rules of natural justice include an obligation to give
reasons.  Where there is
an obligation to give reasons for a decision, that obligation is explained by
reference to rules other than
the traditional rules of natural justice."</i>
<P>

26   	In view of her Honour's exposition, I would follow the
view which she there expressed; but I should add it accords with my
own
opinion.
<P>

27   	I can see no basis in the present case upon which it
should be held that Mr and Mrs Hamilton were denied natural justice in
relation
to the hearing or determination of the claim.
<P>

28   	For those reasons, the application to the Court must be
dismissed with costs.
