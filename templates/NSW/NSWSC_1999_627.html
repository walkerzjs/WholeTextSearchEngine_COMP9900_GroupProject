<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>22 June 1999</b>
<P>

<b>THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE</b>
<P>

1   	The essential issue before me is whether the Plaintiffs'
application for dispensation for late filing of an application by
a dissenting
shareholder under s701(6) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> should be granted
pursuant to s1322(4) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2   	The original application was made in time to the Federal
Court but is rendered nugatory by the High Court's decision in the
"cross-vesting" case on 17 June 1999; <i>Re Wakim; ex parte McNally</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
HCA 27.</a>
<P>

3   	While State legislation has been announced to validate
Federal Court judgments otherwise rendered ineffective, it cannot be
predicted
with any certainty whether or not that legislation will be passed in a form
validating the Plaintiffs' application in the
Federal Court. It cannot at this
time therefore affect the legal outcome of the present application so far as
the substantive question
is concerned.
<P>

<b>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

4   	The Plaintiffs over two years ago applied, purportedly in
pursuance of s701(6) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, to the Federal Court. This
was for the purpose of obtaining an order from that court that the Plaintiffs'
shares not be compulsorily
acquired by the Defendant, Futuris Rural Pty
Limited, pursuant to its offer for all the shares in Elders Australia Limited
("Elders").
That application was made within the time prescribed by s701(6) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>, that is to say prior to the expiry of 10 April
1997, on the assumption that the Federal Court had jurisdiction over the
relevant
proceeding.
<P>

5   	That assumption was one which could reasonably have been
made when the proceedings were commenced. It is rather like the situation
before the House of Lords <i>in Kleinwort Benson Ltd &amp; Ors v Lincoln City
Council</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%203%20WLR%201095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 3 WLR 1095.</a> The House of Lords were dealing with a mistake
of law based on the then settled understanding of what the law <i>was</i>. They
were attempting to reconcile the theory that judges declare rather than make
the law -- albeit restrained by principle, precedent
and the exigencies of the
case in hand -- with the reality that only by evolutionary judicial change in
the law is the common law
kept relevant in a changing world (per Lord
Browne-Wilkinson at 1100). In the present case arising in a constitutional
context, the
point of potential invalidity of the Federal Court's jurisdiction
over <i>Corporations Law</i> matters was at most conceivable just over two
years ago. But clearly enough, <i>at that time</i> the settled view of the law
accorded with the assumption that the Federal Court had jurisdiction over such
<i>Corporations Law</i> applications. It would have required quite remarkable
prescience to predict that, following a prior unanimous full Federal Court
decision confirming that outcome, later affirmed in the High Court, the High
Court would still later come to the opposite conclusion;
I refer to those
decisions below. Certainly as at 10 April 1997 the appeal in <i>Gould v
Brown</i> from the full Federal Court had commenced and while it had the
potential to have rendered that assumption inoperative it in fact
confirmed
that result. Thus if one looked at subsequent events, following that unanimous
Federal Court decision affirming Federal
Court jurisdiction (on 24 June 1996 in
<i>BP Australia Ltd v Amman Aviation Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2062%20FCR%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 62 FCR 451)</a>, by
December 1998 the High Court in <i>Gould v Brown</i> (1998) 193 CLR 346 had
likewise determined that the cross-vesting provisions <i>did</i> permit a State
court to cross-vest to the Federal Court. It thus confirmed that jurisdiction
was validly conferred on the Federal
Court more generally in relation to
<i>Corporations Law</i> matters. It is true that this result was so evenly
balanced that on a bench of six, the result followed from the then Chief
Justice,
Brennan CJ, concurring in that result with two others. Nonetheless,
this decision confirmed that view of the law. However, the reasoning
of the
dissentients had clearly opened the way for potential re-opening of the point,
as has since occurred in <i>Re Wakim</i> (supra), rendering the law thereafter
less settled.
<P>

6   	Thus it was determined by the High Court on 17 June 1999
(by a majority of 6 to 1) that the relevant cross-vesting provisions
did not
validly confer State jurisdiction on Federal Courts (save for exceptions not
presently relevant concerning the ACT and accrued
jurisdiction). It followed
that the Federal Court did not have jurisdiction over <i>Corporations Law</i>
matters generally, save for those exceptions. The Federal Court we now know had
thus no jurisdiction to determine the Plaintiffs'
application under s701(6) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>, though that is said with the wisdom of hindsight.
To have required that hindsight of the Applicant when making its application
over
two years ago is rather like expecting someone at the commencement of the
100 years war writing that "to-day the 100 years war began".
<P>

<b>THE LEGAL ISSUES</b>
<P>

7   	It is against that background that the present application
is made by the Plaintiffs, who are now the sole outside shareholders
of Elders
Australia Limited. It is resisted by the Defendant on a number of grounds.
Before turning to the principal objection, I
should deal with some preliminary
arguments. First, the Defendant contends that the relevant provisions of Ch 6
of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, in which s701 finds its place, already provides
exhaustively and to the exclusion of s1322
<P>

(a)	for ASIC modifications and variations of Ch 6 by s730, and 
<P>

(b)	for court dispensation for contraventions of Ch 6 by s743. 
<P>

8   	However, s1322(4) is an independent source of dispensing
power in the court. Section 701 itself has no internal in-built provision
for
extension of time, as might have precluded s1322 being capable of independent
application. Section 743 could not apply in any
event, as there has been no
<i>contravention</i> of Ch 6 even assuming that the application by the
Plaintiffs purportedly under s701(6) was a nullity. Section 701(6) simply
provides
for <i>how</i> a dissenting shareholder is to apply, in order to
resist compulsory acquisition. It is not <i>contravened</i> if the application
is late; all that happens is that the application fails to conform to its
requirements.
<P>

9   	ASIC modification under s730 provides a wholly different
basis for being permitted to do that which Ch 6 would otherwise preclude.
It
does not narrow s1322 in its intended sphere of operation. Nor has it been
brought into play in the present circumstances, whatever
inherent limitation
there may be in its proper scope in facilitating the appropriation of the
dissentient's property; compare <i>DB Management Pty Ltd v Australian
Securities and Investment Commission and Others</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1999/293.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] FCA 293</a> for which
leave to appeal to the High Court has been given. While allowing dispensation
in one sense does deny the Respondent's contingent
property interest in the
Applicant's shares sought to be compulsorily acquired, that reasoning does not
pre-ordain any outcome in
favour of either party. The Applicant stands to lose
its holding while the Respondent stands to lose its contingent interest in that
holding -- contingent that is, on being able to complete compulsory
acquisition.
<P>

10   	Moreover, the reasoning which concludes that s1322 is
capable of operating independently of a specific power to vary provisions
of a
particular chapter is reflected in the analogous context of s447A and s1322
where both can operate independently also. The New
South Wales Court of Appeal
has confirmed that s1322(4) can dispense with observance of specific provisions
of Pt 5.3A notwithstanding
the presence of s447A in the same Part as also
capable of modifying Pt 5.3A to achieve that same result; see <i>Richard
Campbell Brien &amp; 1 Ors v Australasian Memory Pty Limited &amp; Anor
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 ACSR 1</a> at 48 and (1999) 29 ACSR at 344 at 384-9 per Sheppard
AJA.
<P>

11   	The Defendants' next attack is based on <i>David Grant
&amp; Co Pty Limited v Westpac Banking Corporation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d95%29%20184%20CLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-95) 184 CLR 265</a>
relying on the leading judgment of Gummow J. However, the reasoning of Gummow J
applicable to strict compliance with the requirements
for setting aside
statutory demands under s459G of the <i>Corporations Law</i> cannot be applied
to s701(5). While both sections delineate the conditions for an application to
be made in conformity with the relevant
requirements, s459G does so with the
additional peremptory emphasis of the words "may only". This in the context
supports an interpretation
that s459G leaves no room for s1322. Section 701(6)
on the other hand contains language which lacked that emphatic peremptory
character.
The "gift" of the right to make application to a dissenting
shareholder is, it is true, subject to statutory conditions. But the
conditioning is not of the peremptory kind which precludes the dispensing power
of s1322 where applicable, in contrast to s459G;
compare <i>David Grant</i>
(supra) at 277:
<P>

"An integer or element of the right created by s459G is its exercise by
application  made within the time specified. To adapt what
was said by Isaacs J
in <i>The Crown v McNeil</i> (26), it is a condition of the gift in sub-s(1) of
s459G that sub-s(2) be observed and, unless this is so, the gift can never take
effect. The same is true of sub-s(3)."
<P>

12   	I turn now to s1322 itself. While the Plaintiffs also rely
upon s1322(2) on the basis that what has here occurred is a procedural
irregularity, it is fair to say that the Plaintiffs wisely place principal
reliance on s1322(4)(d) in seeking an order to extend
the period now to apply
to a fresh application to the Supreme Court of New South Wales under s701(6) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. This is on the basis that its earlier application
to the Federal Court is rendered without effect, as being out of time to
satisfy
sub-section (6). That application is made in circumstances where
curative legislation has been foreshadowed by the various states
including,
relevantly here, New South Wales, where the target company Elders was and
remains incorporated. However, I must necessarily
decide this application
without reliance upon whatever future effect, if any, that legislation may
have.
<P>

13   	The critical matter here is whether I am precluded from
making an order of the kind sought, on the basis that s1322(6)(c)
requires that
the Court be satisfied that "no substantial injustice has been or is likely to
be caused to any person".
<P>

14   	The prejudice which the Defendant relies upon is the
deferral of its capacity to compulsorily acquire the balance of the shares
in
Elders while the application under s701(6) is dealt with, causing a consequent
delay in deriving the benefit of having it as a
wholly-owned subsidiary. It can
be conceded that this is a detriment. Its degree is contingent upon whether the
Plaintiffs would
ultimately successfully resist compulsory acquisition in the
principal proceedings, if they are saved by a dispensing order. But
there is at
least the detriment of delay in litigating the matter. But detriment <i>per
se</i> is not the same as substantial injustice; that must depend on whether
the remedial order in giving rise to that detriment is unjust
in the sense of
causing such prejudice overall as to be unfair or inequitable, taking into
account the interests of all of those
directly affected by such
dispensation.
<P>

15   	The authorities on the meaning of "substantial injustice"
are conveniently summarised in a judgment of Owen J in <i>Elderslie Finance
Corporation Limited v ASC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20787" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 787</a> at 791. 
<P>

"I agree with the submission of counsel for the applicant that s1322(4) of the
Law is a remedial remedy and should be given a liberal
construction: see <i>Re
Australian Koyo Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20ACLC%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 ACLC 429</a> at 431;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%208%20ACLR%20928" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 8 ACLR 928</a> at 930. The
onus is on the applicant to establish positively that no substantial injustice
has been or is likely to be caused to
any person; see <i>Australian
Hydrocarbons NL v Green &amp; Ors; Green &amp; Ors v Australian Hydrocarbons
NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20ACLC%20779" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 ACLC 779</a> at 789;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2010%20ACLR%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 10 ACLR 72</a> at 83. The word "injustice"
requires the Court to consider real, and not merely insubstantial or
theoretical prejudice. A degree
of prejudice to a person or persons may be
outweighed if the overwhelming weight of justice is in favour of making the
order: see
<i>Re Compaction Systems Pty Ltd</i> (1977-1978) CLC  40-313 at
29,316;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%202%20ACLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 2 ACLR 135</a> at 150."
<P>

16   	In my judgment, the "overwhelming weight of justice" is in
favour of making the order sought by the Plaintiffs. There could
have been no
legitimate expectation at the time the original application was made,
purportedly in pursuance of s701(6), that the
Federal Court would not have
jurisdiction. Since then, there has been an awakening realisation that there
was that risk. It culminated
in what can fairly be described as a windfall gain
to the Respondent from a successful constitutional challenge not originally
foreseen
when the original application was made. But it could not be said that
the Plaintiffs have so conducted themselves as to preclude
them receiving the
dispensation they seek. That is not said of course with any reference to the
merits or otherwise of the Plaintiffs'
ultimate case in relation to their
application under s701(6).
<P>

17   	The real prejudice to the Defendant is delay in obtaining
compulsory acquisition while proceedings are conducted in this Court.
No doubt
those proceedings will be conducted with expedition as indeed should be a
condition of any dispensing order. If compulsory
acquisition were ultimately to
be denied, that would reflect on the unfairness of the original proposal to
compulsorily acquire and
deserves no sympathy. This is more especially as there
are no outside shareholders save for the Plaintiffs. On the other hand, if
the
Plaintiffs are denied a dispensing order, having, as I am satisfied, met the
onus upon them to show that they would then be precluded
from resisting
compulsory acquisition, they would suffer the prejudice of being forced to
sell, having lost irretrievably the opportunity
to resist as a dissenting
shareholder. 
<P>

<b>SUMMING UP</b>
<P>

18   	To sum up: as any detriment to the Defendant is the result
of being deprived by the remedial order of an unforeseen constitutional
windfall, that hardly constitutes substantial injustice; certainly not such as
would outweigh the irremediable injustice of depriving
the Plaintiffs of their
right to invoke s701(6). This is when they had acted according to the settled
view of the law at the time
in lodging their application with the Federal Court
and had done so within the requisite period were the Federal Court competent
to
entertain that application.
<P>

<b>COSTS</b>
<P>

19   	I do not intend to make any cost orders, despite the
Plaintiffs' success in these present proceedings. The Defendant quite
reasonably agreed to withhold any compulsory acquisition till after the New
South Wales legislation was passed, if it were passed
within two weeks and
subject to an undertaking as to damages. That legislation may or may not have
cured the problem. That was declined
by the Plaintiffs, when the price of it
was an undertaking as to damages. Also, in this context if the Plaintiffs
should ultimately
fail in resisting compulsory acquisition, subject to any
submissions that may be made at the time, the judge concerned should be
free to
reflect that outcome in cost orders that include the present application.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

20   	I make orders as follows:
<P>

(1)	An order in terms of paragraph 4 conditional upon the Plaintiffs pursuing
their principal proceedings pursuant to s701(6) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>
with all due expedition, noting that the Defendant undertakes to the Court that
it will proceed with any defence or counterclaim
with all due expedition.
<P>

(2)	I reserve the costs of this application.
<P>

(3)	I give leave to either party on reasonable notice, following the proposed
State legislation referred to in my judgment being
passed, to apply to vary
these orders so as to take account of the effect of that legislation.
