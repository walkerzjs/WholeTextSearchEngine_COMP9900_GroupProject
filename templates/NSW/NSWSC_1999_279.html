10451/99	<b>MIKELIS STRIKIS   v   JURIS LIEPINS - AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE
OF ANITA ELVIRA PRIEDITIS</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  This is an appeal by way of stated case from a decision of the
Local Court.
<P>

2	Mikelis Strikis, to whom I shall refer as "the appellant", was the defendant
in proceedings in the Local Court.  Those proceedings
were instituted by Juris
Liepins, to whom I shall refer as "the respondent".  The respondent succeeded
in the court below, judgment
being entered in his favour for $11,500.  The
learned magistrate awarded interest from 28 February 1995 in an amount to be
assessed
by the registrar, and he also ordered the appellant to pay the
respondent's costs.  The challenge on the stated case is limited to
the award
of interest.
<P>

3	It is contended by the appellant that the magistrate's decision to award
interest involved error of law.
<P>

4	I draw on the findings of the magistrate as expressed in the stated case for
the following outline of facts.
<P>

5	The appellant is a solicitor who was practising alone when Anita Prieditis
(the deceased) deposited $11,500 with him on 17 June
1991.  The magistrate
found that the appellant received the money in trust pending further
instructions, which were not forthcoming
during the lifetime of the
deceased.
<P>

6	The deceased died on 18 July 1994 and probate in her estate was granted to
the respondent on 20 December 1994.  On 28 February
1995 the respondent, who
like the appellant is a solicitor, wrote to the appellant purporting to enclose
a copy of probate granted,
and requesting within seven days a cheque for the
amount held on behalf of the deceased.  It was not however until on or shortly
after 21 October 1996 that the respondent provided the appellant with a
complete copy of the grant of probate in respect of the estate
of the
deceased.
<P>

7	The inventory forming part of the grant of probate, as identified in the
stated case, described the relevant deposit as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Money deposited with Strikis and Trayer,</i>
<P>

<i>	Solicitors, Level 8, Market Street, Sydney:	$11.500.00"</i>
<P>

8	The appellant's contention before the magistrate, unsuccessfully advanced,
was that having regard to the above description in
the inventory, which
remained unaltered to the date of the decision of the Local Court, the
appellant would not have obtained an
indemnity if he paid over the sum of
$11,500.  As I understand the submission, this was because money had not been
deposited with
the partnership of Strikis and Trayer because that firm had not
existed as at 17 June 1991.
<P>

9	The magistrate rejected that submission, as paragraph 21 of the stated case
makes plain, and he described it as <i>"a pedantic nonsense"</i>.
<P>

10	I observed earlier that the stated case limits the appeal to the award of
interest.  There is no challenge to the judgment for
the principal sum,
although Mr Guest submitted that absent an appropriate description in the
inventory the principal was not strictly
recoverable.
<P>

11	Mr Guest relied upon the provisions of s 81A, s 81B and s 91 of the
<i>Wills, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act</a></i>, 1898.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s81a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 81A</a> requires the
applicant for a grant of probate to disclose to the court the assets and
liabilities of the deceased.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s81b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 81B</a> concerns the disposition of the
property of the deceased:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	Nothing in this Part enables an executor, administrator or trustee of
the estate of a person who dies on or after 31st December,
1981, to complete
the disposition of, and such an executor, administrator or trustee shall not
complete the disposition of, any property
of the deceased vested in the
deceased which has not been disclosed to the Court pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s81a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 81A(1)</a>
or (2)..."</i>
<P>

12	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s91.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 91</a> on which Mr Guest's submission focussed in particular
provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	All persons making or permitting to be made any payment or transfer,
bona fide, upon any probate or administration or order granted
in respect of
the estate of any deceased person under the authority of this Part shall be
indemnified and protected in so doing,
notwithstanding any defect or
circumstance whatsoever affecting the validity of such probate or
administration or order not then
known to such persons.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	In respect of the estate of a person who dies on or after 31st
December, 1981 the indemnity and protection conferred by subsection
(1) shall
apply only in relation to property of the estate of the deceased which is
listed in a document issued by the Court in relation
to the probate,
administration or order."</i>
<P>

13	The magistrate plainly rejected the submission expressed in reliance upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s91.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
91.</a>  He considered the description in the inventory would not have prevented
the indemnity and protection contemplated by that section.
 I am not persuaded
that the decision of the learned magistrate to that effect involved error of
law, and no appeal lies to this
Court in respect of factual error.
<P>

14	Mr Guest submitted however that in any event the discretion to award
interest miscarried.
<P>

15	The power of the Local Court to award interest is conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s39a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39A</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act,</i> 1970</a>.  That section provides in sub-s
(1) as follows:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	In any proceedings for the recovery of any money (including any debt,
demand or damages or the value of any goods), the court
may order that there
shall be included, in the amount for which judgment is given, interest, at such
rate as it thinks fit on the
whole or any part of that amount for the whole or
any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the
date when the judgment takes effect."</i>
<P>

16	The decision to award interest, being discretionary, can only be disturbed
by this Court in well settled circumstances.  In the
much cited passage from
the joint judgment of Dixon , Evatt and McTiernan JJ in <i>House v The King</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55 CLR 499</a> at 504-505, their Honours said:
<P>

	<i>"The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be
determined is governed by established principles.  It is
not enough that the
judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the
position of the primary judge, they
would have taken a different course.  It
must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion.  If the
judge acts
upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant
matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does
not take
into account some material consideration, then his determination should be
reviewed and the appellate court may exercise
its own discretion in
substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so.  It may not appear
how the primary judge has reached
the result embodied in his order, but, if
upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellant court may
infer that
in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the
discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.  In
such a
case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of
the discretion is reviewed on the ground that
a substantial wrong has in fact
occurred."</i>
<P>

17	Interest is ordinarily awarded in favour of a successful plaintiff to
compensate the plaintiff for having been deprived of the
use of money to which
the court has found the plaintiff to have been entitled.
<P>

18	Here however Mr Guest has submitted that given the unsatisfactory
description in the inventory interest should not have been
awarded at all.  In
my opinion the magistrate's rejection of that submission involved no appealable
error.
<P>

19	Mr Guest further submitted that even if it was appropriate to award interest
it should only have been awarded at the earliest
from 21 May 1997 when the
respondent first gave notice that interest would be claimed.
<P>

20	When notice of the claim for interest was given, the appellant was notified
that the claim was being made from 28 February 1995,
which was the date of the
letter requesting payment of the principal sum.  In my opinion it was open to
the magistrate to award interest
from the date he fixed and no error in the
exercise of discretion has been established.
<P>

21	The questions alternatively posed in paragraph 24 of the stated case are to
be answered in the negative.
<P>

22	The amount at issue by way of interest is $3600, so the costs of the
proceedings in this Court may well be disproportionate to
the amount involved.
Nevertheless, the respondent did not bring the case to this Court and he has
succeeded here.  In these circumstances
it seems to me justice requires that he
should recover appropriate costs.
<P>

	<b>Formal decision and order</b>
<P>

23	1.	The questions alternatively posed in paragraph 24 of the stated case are
answered in the negative.
<P>

2.	I order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings in
this Court.
