<b>3798/96 - PETER MICHAEL DRUMMOND AND ROBYN ELIZABETH DEVINE  V  JOHN STEPHEN
DRUMMOND</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is a dispute amongst members of the Drummond
family.  John McPherson Drummond (`J M Drummond') died on 26
January 1989.  He
left his entire estate to his wife Elaine Lenore Drummond.  Letters of
administration cta were granted to his two
sons and daughter who are the
parties to the present proceedings.  Elaine Drummond died on 18 July 1989.
Probate of her will was
granted to her two sons and daughter.  She left a
substantial estate.
<P>

2  	Proceedings were instituted in October 1996, and a cross-claim
was filed in June 1997.  The plaintiffs/cross-defendants are
one of the sons
(Peter Michael Drummond) and the daughter (Robyn Elizabeth Devine).  The
defendant/cross-claimant is the other son,
John Stephen Drummond.  The
plaintiffs sought orders that 7,000 cumulative preference shares and two
ordinary shares in Drummond
Investments Pty Ltd (`the Company'), which remained
in the name of the Estate of J M Drummond, be distributed and transferred in
accordance with the wills of J M and Elaine Drummond.  The defendant as
cross-claimant sought orders in respect of three matters:
 recovery of the sums
of $200,143.04 and $20,793.67 alleged to be owing, and delivery up of two rings
and one third of the other
jewellery in Elaine Drummond's estate.  
<P>

3  	The case came before me for hearing on 15 December 1998.  Counsel
for the defendant informed me at the outset that since the
preparation and
delivery of a chronology and tender bundle in the previous week, the defendant
was in a position to consent to the
orders sought in the summons, subject to
the question of costs.  Further, counsel informed the Court that the defendant
no longer
sought relief in respect of the claim to $200,143.04, but persisted
in the claim to $20,793.67 and the claim to the jewellery.  Counsel
for the
plaintiffs then informed the Court that his clients were prepared to hand over
the two rings which the defendant had demanded,
not admitting any legal
obligation to do so but in conformance with their mother's wishes expressed in
a non-testamentary letter.
 With leave, he filed in Court an amended defence to
the cross-claim which pleaded that the claim for $20,793.67 was statute-barred.
Subsequently counsel for the defendant informed the Court that he had
instructions to discontinue the cross-claim as regards the
remaining jewellery
and the sum of $20,793.67, though he asserted that the claim to that sum would
be a possible issue later in the
administration of the estates.  
<P>

4  	All substantive claims in the proceedings having being resolved
by consent, the only outstanding issue related to costs.  The
case proceeded
into evidence on that issue, on the basis that counsel would prepare draft
orders to be made by consent.  By orders
made on 23 December 1998, the
plaintiffs were granted relief substantially in accordance with the relief
sought in the summons, except
on the question of costs and with a minor
variation in the order of registered ownership of two of the shares.  It was
noted that
Robyn Devine had agreed, without admission of liability, to deliver
up the two rings to the defendant.  The cross-claim was dismissed
except for
the claims with respect to the sum of $20,793.67 and the claim for a
declaration that Robyn Devine had wrongfully detained
one third of the balance
of the jewellery, and in respect of those matters leave was granted to the
defendant as cross-claimant to
discontinue.  
<P>

5  	Three questions were raised with respect to costs.  First, should
the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the
summons and
cross-claim?  Secondly, should the defendant be permitted to recover his costs,
and any costs ordered against him, out
of the Estate of Elaine Drummond?
Thirdly, if the defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiffs' costs, should those
costs be awarded
on an indemnity basis?
<P>

6  	These issues were contested principally in relation to the
summons rather than the cross-claim.  I shall return to the cross-claim
later.
The submissions of the parties with respect to the costs of the summons require
an investigation of the facts concerning the
Company and the dispute between
the parties about the transfer of its shares. 
<P>

<b>Facts and findings concerning the Company and the proposed share
transfers</b>
<P>

7  	The Company was formed on 9 June 1970.  It holds valuable assets
including a portfolio of listed public company shares and a
rural property
known as Marila Park.  Some documents prepared in the 1970s refer to folio
numbers in the Company's share register,
but the evidence before me indicates
that the register, if it ever existed, cannot now be located.  According to an
historical company
extract produced by the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission on 25 November 1998, the issued share capital comprises
32 ordinary shares and 7,000 cumulative preference shares;  all of the
cumulative preference shares and two of the ordinary shares
(which I shall
describe together as `the Estate Shares') are held beneficially by `the Estate
of John McPherson Drummond';  and the
plaintiffs and the defendant each
beneficially hold ten ordinary shares.  
<P>

8  	The evidence includes a copy of the memorandum and articles of
association of the Company.  J M and Elaine Drummond signed the
memorandum as
subscribers for one ordinary share each.  Article 5 authorises the directors to
issue shares with such preferred or
other rights as the directors, subject to
any ordinary resolution of the company, may determine.  Article 10 gives every
person whose
name is entered as a member in the register of members an
entitlement to receive a share certificate.  Article 22 says that any member
may transfer all or any of his shares by instrument in writing in common form
or in the form approved by the directors.  By article
25 the directors are
empowered, but not required, to decline to register any transfer of shares
unless, inter alia, the instrument
of transfer is deposited together with the
certificate of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the
directors
may reasonably require to verify the right of the transferor to make
the transfer and the due execution of the instrument of transfer.
 By article
26 a person entitled to transfer a share in consequence of the death of a
member is empowered to transfer the share to
another member or certain other
listed persons.  Otherwise, the transfer of shares is subject to rights of
pre-emption set out in
article 28.  By article 27 the directors are given the
absolute discretion without assigning any reason, to refuse to register any
transfer to a person of whom they do not approve.  Article 30 provides that in
the case of the death of a member, the legal personal
representative is the
only person recognised by the company as having any title to the shares, and by
article 31 any person entitled
to a share in consequence of the death of a
member may upon producing appropriate evidence be registered or have his
nominee registered
as a member, but the directors have the same discretion to
decline to register a transmission as they would have in the case of a
transfer
of the share.  
<P>

9  	Article 49 empowers any director to convene an extraordinary
general meeting, and such a meeting may also be convened by requisitionists
as
provided by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1961107/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Act 1961</a> (NSW).  Article 73 empowers the shareholders
in general meeting to increase or reduce the number of directors by ordinary
resolution,
and article 75 empowers the shareholders in general meeting to
remove any director and appoint a replacement, by ordinary resolution.
 
<P>

10  	The evidence also includes a copy of a minute of an
extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Company held on
3
September 1970, at which several special resolutions were passed.  One
resolution converted 7,000 ordinary shares into cumulative
preference shares,
and set out the rights of the preference shareholders.  The preference shares
were not expressed to be redeemable,
and the rights attaching to them varied
during and after the lifetime of Edith Ethel Drummond, the mother of J M
Drummond.  Another
special resolution of the same date amended the articles of
association by providing that Edith Ethel Drummond and J M Drummond would
be
joint governing directors and setting out their powers.  As far as the evidence
in this case goes, the memorandum and articles
of the Company remained in this
form at all relevant later times.
<P>

11  	During his lifetime J M Drummond was a director of the Company.
The defendant was appointed secretary in 1979 and a director
in 1983, and
continued in those roles at all later relevant times.  The Company was
deregistered in 1991 for failure to lodge annual
returns, and was restored to
the register in November 1994.  At that time it was necessary for John to
arrange for the appointment
of another director and at his request, Peter
consented to join the board, his appointment taking effect in October 1994.
Peter remained
a director at all later relevant times.  
<P>

12  	On 5 June 1996, at a time when the parties were already in
dispute over other matters, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant
asking the
defendant to execute share transfers for the Estate Shares.  The letter
enclosed forms of share transfers by which the
plaintiffs and defendant as
administrators would transfer the shares from the Estate of J M Drummond to
themselves as the executors
of the Estate of Elaine Drummond, and would then
transfer the shares as executors of the Estate of Elaine Drummond to themselves
as the beneficiaries of that Estate, by transferring one third of the 7,000
preference shares to each beneficiary and transferring
the remaining preference
share and the two ordinary shares into the joint names of the three
beneficiaries.  The transfer forms were
accompanied by a draft direction to be
signed by the plaintiffs and defendant, addressed to themselves as
administrators and executors
and dealing with the distribution of the shares in
this manner. <b> </b>The covering letter stated that it was `not appropriate'
that the shares remain registered in the name of the Estate of J M Drummond,
that the matter `needs to be tidied up' and that it would be `in everyone's
best interest to put the company's affairs on a proper
footing'.  
<P>

13  	It seems to me that this request was a proper and reasonable
one.  As administrators and executors, the plaintiffs and defendant
had the
duty duly to administer the respective estates and after administration, to
distribute the assets to the beneficiaries: 
generally, see J H G Sunnucks, J G
Ross-Martyn and K M Garnett, <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors,
Administrators and Probate</i> (17th ed, 1993), p 934.  In the present case,
the practical effect of the duty was that they ought cause title to the Estate
Shares
to be transferred to the beneficiaries of the Estate of Elaine Drummond.
It is true, as the defendant asserts, that the distribution
of the shares did
not affect the control of the Company, since the plaintiffs already had ten
each of the remaining 30 ordinary shares.
 Nonetheless, in my opinion, it was
appropriate for them to seek to regularise the position, particularly having
regard to the history
of irregular administration of the Company's affairs.
The fact that the distribution of the shares would not affect voting control
of
the Company was no justification for failing to attend to the due
administration of the estates.
<P>

14  	The defendant's solicitors eventually responded on 22 August
1996.  They referred to article 25 which, they said, `require[d]
the production
of the share certificates before the transfer may be registered in the share
register'.  This is plainly wrong, since
article 25 merely gave the directors a
discretion to refuse to register a transfer in the absence of the share
certificate.  The
letter asked the plaintiffs' solicitors to forward duly
executed share transfers and share certificates, to be dealt with by their
client `as a director of' the Company.  It would obviously have been impossible
for the plaintiffs to produce `duly executed' share
transfers unless the
defendant signed them as administrator and executor respectively.  The letter
pointed out that the inventory
of the Estate of Elaine Drummond did not
specifically identify the shares as being an asset of the Estate, and asserted
that it would
be necessary to apply to `amend the Probate as granted' so as to
permit a subsequent transfer from that Estate.  Again, this was
plainly wrong,
since item 7 of the inventory of the Estate of Elaine Drummond referred to an
`Interest in Deceased Estate' and noted
that as the date of her death Elaine
Drummond had not had any of the assets of the Estate of J M Drummond
transferred to her.  Therefore
at the time of her death, Elaine Drummond had a
right <i>in personam </i>to compel the administrators of the Estate of J M
Drummond to attend to the due administration of the estate, the nature of that
right
being described in the inventory.  The letter proceeded to claim, again
wrongly, that it would be necessary for the Company to issue
certificates in
the name of the Elaine Drummond before any subsequent transfer may be approved
and registered in favour of the beneficiaries.
 The letter concluded that legal
proceedings would inappropriate and premature and the defendant would seek to
have them struck out
with costs.  
<P>

15  	On every significant point the letter of 22 August 1996 was
wrong in law.  Further, the letter proceeded on the basis that
the defendant
had no active duty to investigate the true position with respect to the
shareholdings in the Company, notwithstanding
that he was a director and
secretary of the Company and an administrator and executor of the two estates
respectively, as well as
the person most closely involved in the affairs of the
Company and the person who had (as I shall point out) signed annual returns
which represented that the Estate Shares were held by the Estate of J M
Drummond.  In fact the defendant had a clear positive duty
of inquiry, to which
I shall return.  
<P>

16  	Either the author of the letter was ignorant of important legal
principles or the letter was a reckless or deceptive attempt
to stand in the
way of the plaintiffs' proper request to their fellow administrator and
executor to discharge their common duty to
complete the administration of the
two estates.  The immediate author of the letter was the defendant's solicitor,
but the defendant
admitted in evidence that he prepared a draft of that letter
and settled its contents with the solicitor.  The defendant is a
barrister-at-law
who practises, amongst other areas, in commercial law, and so
the letter of 22 August 1996 reflects very poorly on him personally.
 
<P>

17  	In their letter of 11 September 1996 the defendant's solicitors
compounded the errors which they and their client had previously
made.  They
claimed that their earlier letter had `clearly' stated the effect of article
25, namely that the directors may decline
to register a transfer of shares in
the absence of the certificate, and they said `our client did not, nor does it
assert that such
production was mandatory'.  And yet the letter of 22 August
1996 had purported to note that article 25 <i>required</i> the production of
the share certificate <i>before the transfer may be registered</i>, and stated
that `in the absence of the relevant share certificates the transfers cannot be
registered if executed'.  
<P>

18  	The letter of 11 September 1996 asserted that the defendant had
not refused to transfer the shares, but had merely sought production
of the
necessary evidence to establish that J M Drummond was the registered holder.
The letter claimed that the plaintiffs had no
material to establish that the
7,000 preference shares were ever in fact issued to J M Drummond, and that a
director would be in
breach of his fiduciary duty to the Company to register a
share transfer where there exists no evidence to support the alleged
entitlement
to the shares.  Again, this assertion is wrong in law, as I shall
explain more fully later.  In my opinion the defendant's fiduciary
duty to the
Company as a director was to make reasonable and proper inquiries to clear up
the uncertainty which he claimed to have
arisen notwithstanding his continued
endorsement of annual returns which represented that the shares existed and
were held by the
Estate of J M Drummond.  The letter reiterated that in the
defendant's opinion any proceedings would be inappropriate and premature
and
the defendant would move to have them struck out. 
<P>

19  	The defendant sought to explain his attitude to the transfer of
shares in his affidavit and oral evidence at the hearing. 
He said that until
he received the request by his brother and sister for share transfers, he
assumed that the Estate Shares had been
properly issued and belonged to the
Estate of J M Drummond because his father had told him so on several occasions.
Relying on those
statements, he was principally responsible for preparing the
inventory of assets on the basis of which letters of administration
cta were
issued to him and the plaintiffs in respect of their father's estate.  The
inventory showed the Estate Shares as belonging
to J M Drummond.  He said that
at some time after the plaintiffs wrote to him on 5 June 1996, he examined the
memorandum and articles
of association of the Company and noticed that his
father had subscribed for only one share, the other share being originally held
by his mother.  He was unable to locate any share register or other
documentation which would establish that the preference shares
were in fact
issued to Edith Drummond or transferred to J M Drummond, or any similar
evidence to show the transfer of one ordinary
share from Elaine Drummond to J M
Drummond, or to show the issue of ten ordinary shares to the plaintiffs and
himself.  He did, however,
find a tax return for 1982 which stated that he and
the plaintiffs each held ten ordinary shares and that J M Drummond held the
Estate
Shares.
<P>

20  	The defendant's investigation of the shareholdings of the
Company was within a very limited compass.  It appears that he looked
through
the papers which he possessed with respect to his father's and mother's
affairs.  He said he undertook an examination of
the books and records of the
Company but it is not clear that it extended beyond the papers in his
possession.  The Company's accountant
during the period from 1983 until March
1994 was Mr G J Newman.  The defendant replaced Mr Newman with Nelson Thomas
&amp; Co, Chartered
Accountants, in 1994, after he discovered that the Company
had been deregistered.  While Mr Newman was no longer acting for the Company
in
1996, it was open to the defendant to inquire whether Mr Newman had any
relevant corporate records, but he did not do so.  He
had previously written a
letter to Mr Newman on 27 May 1994 which he described in his affidavit of 14
December 1998 as a request
`that he return to me all the records held by him on
behalf of' the Company.  But on examination, that letter merely asked for
specified
documents to permit the defendant to prepare his personal tax return,
including `documents in relation to dividend receipts' and
`books and records
in respect to the operation of `Marila Park'', but not the Company's minutes
books, registers or corporate records.
 
<P>

21  	Further, it was open to the defendant to conduct a search of
public records of the Company held by the Australian Securities
and Investments
Commission, including microfiche records of the Registrar of Companies, but he
did not do so.  
<P>

22  	The defendant's evidence is that since the investigations which
he made were unsuccessful, the doubt which had been created
by his discovery of
the memorandum and articles of association remained and he therefore declined
to execute share transfers in the
absence of evidence which would remove his
doubt.  This is not a plausible explanation for his refusal to co-operate with
his co-executors.
 An ordinary prudent person, let alone a barrister, would
have realised that one of the original subscribers may have transferred
her
shares and that the Company's constitution made provision for the issue of new
shares.  Prudence would then require that any
queries be pursued by proper
investigation from those most likely to have relevant information - the
Company's accountant at the
time and the Commission.  Quite apart from the duty
which he had as legal personal representative, director and secretary, the
defendant's
failure to pursue any such inquiries renders implausible his
evidence that he developed a doubt about the status and ownership of
the Estate
Shares.
<P>

23  	On 25 March 1997, some months after the commencement of these
proceedings, the plaintiffs' solicitors wrote to the defendant's
solicitors
proposing a round-table conference and mediation but insisting that the proper
administration of the estates required
registration of the share transfers as a
prerequisite to any settlement conference.  The letter gave the defendant the
opportunity
to consent to the transfer of the shares without penalty as to
costs, but he did not do so.  
<P>

24  	Shortly before the hearing and in accordance with my pre-trial
directions, the plaintiffs served a chronology and bundle of
documents on the
defendant.  The documents included the historical company extract of 25
November 1998 to which I have referred,
a bundle of photocopy returns tabbed
`Records of the Registrar of Companies', and some copies of documents tabbed
`Drummond Investments
Pty Ltd - Other Corporate Records'.  
<P>

25  	The records of the Registrar of Companies were obtained by
search of the public records presently maintained by the Australian
Securities
and Investments Commission.  The Commission, formerly known as the Australian
Securities Commission, is the successor
to the National Companies and
Securities Commission and the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales,
which in turn was the
successor to the Registrar of Companies of New South
Wales.  The records of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission
include records of documents filed with the predecessor entities.
<P>

26  	The `Other Corporate Records' were obtained by the plaintiffs
from Mr Newman, the Company's former accountant, within the two
months
preceding the hearing.  There was no obstacle to the defendant obtaining both
sets of documents at a much earlier stage.
<P>

27  	The defendant's evidence is that the documents were served on
his counsel on 10 December 1998 and he had the opportunity to
examine them in
counsel's chambers on Sunday 13 December 1998, two days before the commencement
of the hearing.  At no time prior
to 10 December 1998 had the plaintiffs
informed him, directly or through legal advisers, that these documents were in
the plaintiffs'
possession.  The defendant said that when he examined the
documents he concluded that they established that the Estate Shares were
properly to be considered as part of the Estate of J M Drummond.  He therefore
agreed to execute transfers of the shares as sought
by the plaintiffs, subject
to an adjustment of the order in which the holders of the two ordinary shares
were to be recorded.  
<P>

28  	The records of the Registrar of Companies in the tender bundle
of documents relate to the Company for the period 1970 to 1979,
supplemented by
ASIC records from 1990 to 1997.  The `other corporate records' relate to the
Company for the period from 1970 to
1975.  The former category of records
(which I shall call the `public records') indicates that:
<P>

&#183;	an ordinary share was allotted to each of J M and Elaine Drummond upon
the company's formation in June 1970, they being the
subscribers to the
memorandum;
<P>

&#183;	an additional 7,030 ordinary shares were allotted on 3 September 1970,
7,000 to Edith Ethel Drummond and 30 to J M Drummond;
 
<P>

&#183;	in the 1970 annual return of the Company J M Drummond was said to hold
31 ordinary shares in trust for Edith, Peter, John
and Robyn, and Edith was
said to hold one ordinary share and 7,000 cumulative preference shares;
<P>

&#183;	in the annual return for 1971 Edith's shares were recorded as held by
`Estate of the late Edith Drummond' (she having died
in September 1971);
<P>

&#183;	in the annual return for 1972 all of the 7,032 shares were recorded as
held by J M Drummond in trust for Peter, John and
Robyn, and according to later
annual returns that situation continued until at least 1979;
<P>

&#183;	the 1990 annual return recorded that the same number of shares was on
issue, but 10 ordinary shares were held by each of
John, Peter and Robyn, with
the remaining two ordinary shares and 7,000 cumulative preference shares held
by `the Estate of Drummond,
John McPherson', and those holdings were repeated
in the annual returns for the years 1991 to 1997 inclusive;
<P>

&#183;	the annual returns up to 1979 were signed by J M and Elaine Drummond as
directors, while the annual returns for 1990 to 1993
inclusive were signed by
the defendant, in each case on 1 September 1994;
<P>

&#183;	on 8 November 1994 the Company was restored to the register after a
period of deregistration;
<P>

&#183;	the annual returns for 1994 and 1995, showing the shareholding
information noted above, were signed by the defendant on 2
February and 29
December 1995 respectively, and the annual returns for 1996 and 1997 showing
the same information were lodged electronically.
<P>

29  	The `other corporate records' which are in evidence provide some
corroboration of the public records.  Some unsigned minutes
of a meeting of
directors of the Company on 3 September 1970 indicate that Elaine transferred
her subscriber's ordinary share to
Edith Drummond and J M Drummond declared a
trust in favour of Edith Drummond over the other ordinary share which was
registered in
his name.  Some copies of correspondence indicate that the trust
referred to in the annual returns during the 1970s was probably
a trust of only
30 of the issued shares, J M Drummond holding 10 shares for each of his
children John, Peter and Robyn.  
<P>

30  	While the evidence of public and other corporate records is not
complete nor entirely clear on some matters, it appears to
me to establish that
7,032 shares of the Company were issued;  the two ordinary subscriber shares
were transferred and transmitted
but eventually were held by J M Drummond;  the
7,000 cumulative preference shares were also eventually held by J M Drummond;
and
the remaining 30 ordinary shares were at some point transferred or
transmitted to each of the plaintiffs and the defendant in parcels
of 10
shares.  
<P>

31  	ASIC's historical company extract issued on 25 November 1998
helps to overcome doubts which one might otherwise have about
these
conclusions, for it clearly states that the plaintiffs and the defendant each
hold ten ordinary shares beneficially, while
two ordinary shares and 7,000
cumulative preference shares are held by `the Estate of Drummond, John
McPherson'.  The significance
of the ASIC extract is explained by s 1274B(2) of
the Corporations Law, which states:
<P>

`In a proceeding in a court, a writing that purports to have been prepared by
the Commission is admissible as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matter
stated in so much of the writing as sets out what purports to be information
obtained by the Commission, by
using a data processor, from the national
database.  In other words, the writing is proof of such a matter in the absence
of evidence
to the contrary.'
<P>

32  	The historical company extract is a writing that purports to
have been prepared by the Commission.  It begins with the words
`Section 1274B
This extract has been prepared by the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission from information it obtained,
by using a data processor, from the
national database.'  It follows that the historical company extract is <i>prima
facie</i> evidence of, inter alia, the number of shares on issue and the
identity of the shareholders in the Company.  The earlier records
of the
Registrar of Companies and the other corporate records corroborate the
information about shareholdings contained in the extract.
 
<P>

33  	Taken together, all this evidence was sufficient to justify a
decision by the executors to execute share transfers in order
to distribute the
shares to the beneficiaries of the Estate of Elaine Drummond.
<P>

<b>The defendant's duty to clarify the status and ownership of the Estate
Shares</b>
<P>

34  	I have found that the letters written on behalf of the defendant
on 22 August and 11 September 1996 contained errors of law
which implied either
that the author was ignorant of important legal principles or was acting
recklessly or deceptively in an attempt
to obstruct the plaintiffs' proper
request to their fellow administrator and executor to complete the
administration of the estates.
 I have also found that the defendant's
explanation for developing a doubt as to the issue and ownership of the Estate
Shares is
implausible.  
<P>

35  	The demand by the defendant for the production of share
certificates was impossible to sustain for some additional reasons.
 At the
time of the letter of 22 August 1996:
<P>

(a)	as an administrator of the Estate of J M Drummond and an executor of the
Estate of Elaine Drummond, the defendant had a duty
(which I have explained) to
attend to the due administration of those estates and in so doing, to
distribute any shares which were
part of either estate to the appropriate
beneficiaries;
<P>

(b)	as a director of the Company since 1983, he had a fiduciary duty to act in
the best interests of the shareholders of the Company,
which implied a duty to
clarify any uncertainty which may exist as to the proper allotment and issue of
the Company's shares, for
in the absence of clarification the Company could not
adequately discharge its statutory and other obligations to its shareholders
(such as the obligation to pay any dividend which may be properly declared and
to give notice to shareholders of any general meeting),
and the director
himself could not adequately to discharge his duty to consider the
shareholders' interests;
<P>

(c)	as a director and the secretary of the Company since 1979, he had a duty to
the Company to ensure that it complied with its
obligations under the
Corporations Law to keep proper books and records, including the register of
members required to be kept by
s 169 of the Corporations Law, and a risk of
personal liability as a person knowingly concerned in a contravention by the
Company
in the event that the relevant statutory obligations of the Company
were not discharged (a risk enhanced by the reversal of the onus
of proof
contained in s 83(2));
<P>

(d)	therefore, if he had any real doubt as to whether shares had been properly
issued or registered in the name of his late father,
he had a duty to the
Company as a director and the secretary to carry out investigations with a view
to removing that doubt;
<P>

(e)	as the person primarily responsible for collation and preparation of
information with respect to the estates, and (after his
father's death) for the
collation of information and maintenance of records of the Company, he was in a
better position than either
of the plaintiffs to ascertain whether share
certificates had ever been issued, and to investigate and fill any deficiencies
in information
with respect to the Company's records of shareholdings;
<P>

(f)	he personally signed as a director the annual returns for the period from
1990 to 1995, recording that the Estate of J M Drummond
was the owner of the
Estate Shares, thereby exposing himself to liability under s 1308(4) of the
Corporations Law if he had failed
to take reasonable steps to ensure that the
statements in those returns about the Estate Shares were not false or
misleading;
<P>

 (g)	he was principally responsible for preparing the inventory of assets in
the Estate of J M Drummond which showed two ordinary
and 7,000 preference
shares as assets of the Estate;  
<P>

(h)	as a director and the secretary of the Company, he was in a position to
obtain from Mr Newman, the Company's former accountant,
copies of the documents
which were eventually put in evidence in this case;
<P>

(i)	the investigations which he might have carried out included company
searches to obtain copies of the documents filed with the
Registrar of
Companies during the 1970s, which are now in evidence;
<P>

(j)	he could also have obtained an historical company extract similar to the
one dated 25 November 1998 which is in evidence, which
would be prima facie
evidence as to the statement of shareholdings under s 1274B of the Corporations
Law;
<P>

(k)	had he made appropriate investigations of these kinds, he would have been
able to satisfy himself on the balance of probabilities
that the Estate Shares
had been properly issued and were legally and beneficially owned by J M
Drummond at the date of his death.
<P>

<b>Conclusion as to the transfer of the Estate Shares</b>
<P>

36  	My conclusion, therefore, is that the plaintiffs' demand that
the shares be distributed to the beneficiaries of the Estate
of Elaine Drummond
was a proper demand in the performance of their duties as legal personal
representatives, and one with which the
defendant should have complied.  The
defendant's assertion that he developed a genuine doubt about the existence and
ownership of
the Estate Shares is implausible.  However, if he had such a
doubt, he should have made inquiries which would have provided evidence
sufficient for him to rely on and armed with that evidence, he would have had
no basis for refusing the plaintiffs' request.  In
the circumstances,
therefore, his resistance and obstruction were unjustified and his behaviour
was unacceptable.
<P>

<b>Should the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the
summons?</b>
<P>

37  	The defendant submits that he should not be ordered to pay costs
because he was not aware of the contents of the records of
the Registrar of
Companies and the `other corporate records' until shortly before the
commencement of the hearing, and when he became
aware of that information he
instructed his counsel to consent to the orders sought in the summons.  But as
I have found, the defendant
obstructed the plaintiffs' legitimate claim without
justification, putting forward false propositions of law, and he failed to
discharge
his duty to make inquiries.  Given his conduct, he has no basis for
resisting the application of the normal rule that costs should
follow the
event.  
<P>

38  	The defendant's counsel submitted that the commencement of
proceedings to compel the defendant to join in the distribution
of the shares
was a `punctilious adherence to form' which would not confer any practical
benefit on anyone.  There were, in his submission,
other courses of conduct
which the plaintiffs could have taken which would have avoided litigation, and
their institution of proceedings
was therefore unreasonable, particularly since
success by them would not affect the equity or control of the Company.  In
particular,
counsel submitted that since the plaintiffs had effective control
of the Company by virtue of holding 20 voting shares, they could
have convened
a special general meeting to remove the defendant as a director.  This would
have been a practical means of self-help.
 
<P>

39  	I reject this submission.  For the reasons I have given, the
plaintiffs were entitled to compel their fellow administrator
and executor to
perform his duties.  Where a duty which is owed by one person to another is not
discharged and there are no extenuating
circumstances, the person to whom the
duty is owed is entitled to take proceedings for vindication.  It is not
necessary for that
person to engage in some other form of self-help,
particularly where that other course of conduct involves risk and potential
delay.
 An attempt by the plaintiffs to remove the defendant from the board of
the Company could well have led to litigation to challenge
the validity of the
plaintiffs' conduct - for example, on the ground of oppression or unfairly
prejudicial conduct under what is
now s 246AA of the Corporations Law.  Given
the antagonism between the parties, the plaintiffs could have no assurance that
this
method of `self-help' would be any more effective or less expensive than
the course which they chose to pursue, which was the most
straightforward way
of asserting the rights which they believed, correctly, that they had against
their co-executor.
<P>

40  	Counsel for the defendant also submits that there is an
important difference between the material now before the Court and
the
affidavits which were filed earlier in the proceedings.  The defendant has
consented to orders upon being presented with the
material which is now in
evidence, but in the absence of that material at an earlier time he was
entitled as a fiduciary to bring
forward a concern about the absence of source
material for the asserted shareholding.  But this submission overlooks the
primary
duty which the defendant had to make reasonable and proper
investigations.  He was not entitled to sit back and expect the plaintiffs
to
do so.  The fact that he may only have seen the evidence just before the trial
does not exonerate him from his failure to make
the proper inquiries which
would in all probability have unearthed the evidence at a much earlier stage.
The inquiries which he made,
set out in his affidavit of 15 May 1997, were
clearly inadequate because they did not involve proper interrogation of the
Company's
former accountant or a proper search of public records held by
ASIC.
<P>

<b>Should the defendant's costs, including costs awarded against him, be
recoverable from the Estate of Elaine Drummond?</b>
<P>

41  	The defendant contends that he has a right of indemnity out of
the Estate of Elaine Drummond, so that costs on the summons,
including any of
the plaintiffs' costs which he may be ordered to pay, should be borne by the
estate.  
<P>

42  	Under s 76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW), costs are
generally in the discretion of the Court.  However, the discretion must be
exercised judicially and the ordinary
rule is that costs follow the event,
except where it appears to the Court that some other order should be made:
Supreme Court Rules,
Pt 52A r 11.  An order that the costs of an unsuccessful
party in litigation concerning a trust or the estate of a deceased person
be
paid out of the trust fund or estate operates as an exception to the general
rule:  <i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administration and
Probate,</i> p 437.  
<P>

43  	In <i> Miller v Cameron </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2054%20CLR%20572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 54 CLR 572</a>, 578, Latham CJ
explained that `as a rule, a trustee is allowed his costs out of the trust
estate if his conduct has been honest,
even though it may have been mistaken.'
In <i>Re Weall;  Andrews v Weall </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2042%20ChD%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 42 ChD 674</a>, 677, Kekewich J spoke
of the `tenderness which the Court is anxious to exhibit towards trustees
honestly exercising discretion in
discharge of their duties, often difficult
and still more often thankless.'  In <i>Re Jones;  Christmas v Jones </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%202%20Ch%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897]
2 Ch 190</a>, 197 the same judge said that `a man who fulfils the difficult duties
of an administrator, executor or trustee is, in common sense
and common
justice, entitled to be recouped to the very last penny everything that he has
expended properly - that is to say, without
impropriety - in his character of
administrator, executor or trustee ...'.  Thus it is normally the case that an
executor who commences
or defends an action in the capacity of executor is
entitled to be indemnified out of the estate for the costs incurred in doing
so, even if the litigation is unsuccessful, the executor's conduct is found to
have been mistaken, and the other party in the litigation
is held to be
entitled to an order for costs.  
<P>

44  	This exception to the normal rule that costs follow the event,
which permits an executor to recover costs from the estate,
is itself subject
to some exceptions, as is plain from Latham CJ's reference to honest conduct
and Kekewich J's reference to impropriety.
 There are two `sub-exceptions'
which are arguably relevant to the present case.  
<P>

45  	The first is the sub-exception for `impropriety'.  As Kekewich J
made clear in <i>Re Jones</i>, cases of impropriety include an executor taking
or defending proceedings in breach of trust, or conducting the proceedings in
such
a way that the Court, on a general view of the case, regards the
executor's conduct as `not honestly brought forward' ([1897] 2 Ch
190, 198).
Additionally, recourse to the estate may be denied to an executor `where the
claim is of monstrous character, that is,
one which no reasonable man could say
ought to have been put forward' (at 198).  In <i>Re Weall</i> the trustees
allowed a solicitor to deduct fees which were not properly chargeable to the
life tenant from the rental income of the
estate.  Kekewich J observed that
while mistakes or errors in judgment would not disentitle the trustees to an
indemnity, the beneficiaries
were entitled to expect `reasonable prudence' of
the trustees (42 ChD at 678-9). 
<P>

46  	In my opinion the present case falls squarely within the
`sub-exception' as articulated by Kekewich J in these two cases. 
In the
present case the defendant acted obstructively, unreasonably and in disregard
of his clear duty, during the period from June
1996 until just prior to the
hearing.  I do not find that he acted dishonestly in any positive sense, but he
defended the summons
on a basis which no reasonable person could say should be
put forward, by an executor or otherwise.
<P>

47  	Secondly, the rule which gives an executor the prima facie
entitlement to be indemnified out of the estate for costs relates
only the
costs incurred in the administration and distribution of the estate.  Such
costs are to be distinguished from costs incurred
by an executor in furtherance
of a personal interest:  <i>Miller v Cameron </i>(1936) 54 CLR at 578-9;  <i>Re
Jones </i>[1897] 2 Ch at 197-8;  <i>Plimsoll v Drake (No.2)</i> (Supreme Court
of Tasmania, Zeeman J, unreported, 8 June 1995). Executors who pursue personal
interests in litigation are `not fighting
for the estate any more than if they
were not executors at all':  <i>Skrimshire v Melbourne Benevolent Asylum</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1894/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1894] VicLawRp 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281894%29%2020%20VLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1894) 20 VLR 13</a>, 18 per Madden CJ.  An executor who prosecutes or defends
proceedings in the capacity of, say, creditor or beneficiary of the estate
rather than in the capacity as executor cannot expect to recoup the costs of
litigation from the estate simply on the basis that
he or she is also an
executor.  In <i>Miller v Cameron</i> Latham CJ took the view that a trustee
who defended an action for his removal was thereby representing his own
interests and not
those of the trust estate.  In <i>Plimsoll v Drake</i> Zeeman
J reached a similar conclusion where a trustee unsuccessfully asserted the
right to demand a release before distributing the
trust estate to the
beneficiaries.  
<P>

48  	In the present case the defendant claims that he refused to
execute the share transfers which would distribute the Estate Shares
to the
beneficiaries of the Estate of Elaine Drummond because he was not satisfied
that those shares had been properly issued and
were held by J M Drummond at the
date of his death.  That concern, if it existed, related to the discharge of
the defendant's duties
as administrator and executor of the estates.  On the
material before me I cannot conclude that in defending the proceedings on this
ground, the defendant was acting in his personal interest rather than the
capacity of executor.  Therefore, while this sub-exception
applies to the
cross-claim for the reasons which I shall explain, my opinion is that it has no
application to the defence of the
summons.  
<P>

49  	There is another exception to the normal rule that costs follow
the event, which is arguably relevant in the present case.
 The Court may on
some occasions permit a person who conducts litigation in a private capacity to
recoup costs from a trust fund
or estate.  The principles are set in
<i>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate
</i>at 437-441.  The situation which is arguably relevant to the present case
is where the litigation has been caused by the conduct of
the testator.  In
<i>Brown v McEncroe</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLawRp/1890/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1890] NSWLawRp 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2011%20LR%20%28NSW%29%20Eq%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 11 LR (NSW) Eq 134</a> the plaintiffs propounded a
will which treated the deceased's widow harshly.  After she died, the
administrator of her estate contested
the application for probate on the ground
of testamentary incapacity.  Although there was evidence that the testator had
been an
alcoholic, the Court held that the challenge to his testamentary
capacity had failed.  However, Owen CJ in Eq held that the defendant's
costs
should be recovered out of the testator's estate.  The testator, by reason of
his conduct, was considered to be the cause of
the litigation which occurred
after his death (at 145). 
<P>

50  	In my opinion this principle has no application in the present
case.  Although the evidence indicates that J M Drummond did
not properly
attend to the administration of the affairs of the Company before his death,
the defendant was his co-director from
1983 onwards, and was the company
secretary from 1979.  Therefore the defendant shared the responsibility for
failure to maintain
proper corporate records and registers.  Moreover, in my
opinion the direct cause of the present litigation was the defendant's failure
to make property inquiries when confronted with the plaintiffs' request for
execution of share transfers in 1996, rather than any
events prior to J M
Drummond's death.  
<P>

51  	I conclude that there is no basis for ordering that the
defendants' costs on the summons be borne by the Estate of Elaine Drummond.
<P>

<b>Indemnity costs</b>
<P>

52  	The plaintiffs contend that the defendant should be ordered to
pay their costs on an indemnity basis.  They seek to rely on
cases such as
<i>Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants
Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/202.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 202</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2081%20ALR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 81 ALR 397</a>;  <i>Davids Holdings Pty Ltd v Coles Myer Ltd
</i>(1995) ATPR para 41-383;  and <i>Rouse v Shepherd (No.2) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2035%20NSWLR%20277" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 35
NSWLR 277</a>;  <i>Baillieu Knight Frank (NSW) Pty Ltd v Ted Manny Real Estate Pty

Geebung Investments Pty Ltd </i>(Supreme Court of New South Wales, Abadee J,
unreported, 15 November 1994).  
<P>

53  	The principles relating to the award of indemnity costs were
discussed by Sheppard J in <i>Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/536.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 536</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20118%20ALR%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
118 ALR 248.</a>  He distilled the following proposition from his review of the
cases (at 256): 
<P>

`In consequence of the settled practice which exists, the court ought not
usually make an order for the payment of costs on some
basis other than the
party and party basis.  The circumstances of the case must be such as to
warrant the court in departing from
the usual course. ...'
<P>

54  	One of the grounds for departing from the usual course,
exemplified by Woodward J's judgment in the <i>Fountain Selected Meats </i>case
(at 400), is where a litigant's conduct is vexatious in the sense that
proceedings are commenced or pursued, or a defence is
made or persisted in when
there are no sufficient grounds to do so.  Further, if one party to litigation
puts the other on notice
that it regards the latter's conduct of the litigation
as misconceived, and sets out detailed reasons for so thinking, and the other
party nevertheless proceeds without indicating any proper justification for
doing so and fails, indemnity costs may well be justified:
 <i>Davids Holdings
</i>at 440, 303 per Drummond J.  <i>Rouse v Shepherd</i> was a case where the
defendants denied liability until the second day of the hearing.
Badgery-Parker J found that their change of
stance indicated either that the
plaintiffs' case, as revealed on the first day of the hearing, was so
overwhelming (and unexpectedly
so) that the defendants suddenly decided they
had no possible chance of success, or that they had some ulterior motive in
delaying
the admission of liability until that stage.  On the evidence he
concluded that the latter was the more cogent explanation.  In the
<i>Varga
Group</i> case Abadee J ordered the defendants to pay costs on an indemnity
basis because they should have known they had no chance of success,
if properly
advised, and he was inclined to the view that the defendants knew that their
defences were totally frivolous and/or thoroughly
unjustified.  
<P>

55  	In my opinion each of these cases is useful in terms of general
principle.  Here, an order that the defendant pay the plaintiffs'
costs on an
indemnity basis is amply justified by the facts which I have set out, and in
particular, by the obstructive and unreasonable
letters by the defendant's
solicitors of 22 August and 11 September 1996, the defendant's failure to make
reasonable and proper inquiries
in the circumstances, and his failure to take
advantage of the offer of 25 March 1997 which would have enabled the question
of transfer
of the shares to be resolved without any penalty as to costs on his
part.
<P>

56  	At the very least, the defendant, if properly advised, should
have known that the defence to the summons had no chance of success.
 The
defence was so thoroughly unjustified as to be close to frivolous, and was
vexatious in the sense described in the <i>Fountain Selected Meats </i>case.
By their solicitors' letter of 2 September 1996, the plaintiffs put the
defendant on notice that the defence was misconceived.
 I am not able to find,
on the facts before me, that the defendant acted out of an ulterior motive, but
in the absence of an ulterior
motive I can see no rational explanation for his
conduct other than an alarming ignorance of the law.
<P>

57  	My conclusion therefore is that I should order the defendant to
pay the plaintiffs' costs on the summons on an indemnity basis.
<P>

<b>The cross-claim</b>
<P>

58  	Comparatively little evidence was tendered on the cross-claim,
since (as I have mentioned) it was partly dismissed and partly
discontinued by
consent.  The outstanding issues are whether the plaintiffs' costs should be
paid by the defendant, whether (as the
defendant submits) the defendant's costs
(including any costs of the plaintiffs which the defendant may be ordered to
pay) are recoverable
out the Estate of Elaine Drummond, and whether the
plaintiffs' costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis.  Before expressing
my findings on those matters, I shall set out the facts which are supported by
the limited evidence which is before me.  
<P>

59  	Elaine Drummond's jewellery was part of the residue of her
estate to be divided equally amongst her children John, Peter and
Robyn.
However, she left an undated letter expressing her wishes concerning the
distribution of certain specified items.  The letter
allocated a solitaire
diamond ring, a sapphire and diamond ring and a large silver tray to the
defendant.  On 4 March 1996 the defendant
wrote to his sister, Robyn Devine, in
South Australia asking her to bring the two rings and the tray with her to a
meeting which
was scheduled to take place on 8 March 1996.  He said that there
would remain a number of smaller items which would require equitable
distribution, but that could be done at a later date.  Robyn replied by letter
of 7 March 1996 saying that she was unable, due to
the lack of notice and time,
to give him the two rings which he had requested.  
<P>

60  	On 15 November 1996 the defendant's solicitors wrote to the
plaintiffs' solicitors asking them to obtain instructions in relation
to `some
matters which remain outstanding in relation to the Estate of the late E L
Drummond', including delivery of the two rings
and one third of the balance of
Elaine Drummond's jewellery.  The letter noted that Robyn Devine had retained
custody and safe keeping
of all of the estate's jewellery but had refused
`despite repeated requests' to deliver the requested items to the defendant.
There
is no evidence of `repeated requests'.  On the face of it, it was not
unreasonable for Robyn Devine to decline to bring the jewellery
with her to the
meeting on 8 March 1996, in response to a letter written on 4 March 1996. 
<P>

61  	The plaintiffs' solicitors replied on 25 March 1997, saying that
the jewellery was the major realisable asset in the Estate
of Elaine Drummond
and should not be distributed at that stage, since it may be necessary that the
jewellery be sold to pay any debts,
including the debts claimed by the
defendant.  
<P>

62  	In their letter of 15 November 1996 the defendant's solicitors
asked the plaintiffs' solicitors to obtain instructions in relation
to another
matter which was said to remain outstanding in the Estate of Elaine Drummond,
namely payment of the sum of $200,143.04,
being moneys due to Banarway Pastoral
Co.  The letter referred to an affidavit of J Murray of 29 August 1996 in
proceedings No. 4235/95.
 The plaintiffs' solicitors responded on 25 March
1997, saying that Mr Murray's conclusion was fanciful and that there was no
debit
in the late Mrs Drummond's account in Banarway Pastoral Company.  Mr
Murray's affidavit and report are not in evidence in the present
proceedings,
but the evidence before me includes a report by Pannell Kerr Forster dated 9
December 1998 which critically reviews
Mr Murray's report.  In
cross-examination it was put to the defendant that he had dropped the claim to
recover this amount because
he appreciated that the claim had no justification
of any kind.  He disagreed with that proposition, saying he had an expert's
report
that supported the figure which he claimed.  He said the report
contained an assumption which, upon reflection, he did not consider
would be
sustainable.
<P>

63  	The defendant's solicitors' letter of 15 November 1996 raised a
third matter in relation to the Estate of Elaine Drummond.
 This was `payment
to our client of the sum of $20,793.67 being monies paid by him on behalf of
the Estate of the late Dr J M Drummond
and Mrs E L Drummond being payments made
prior to the grant of Probate on both Estates (see Scheduled [sic] attached).'
The schedule
attached to the letter, which also appears as an annexure to the
cross-claim, particularises seven items by date, payee, cheque number
and
amount, the dates ranging from 2 February 1989 to 20 December 1990.  In their
reply dated 25 March 1997 the plaintiffs' solicitors
asked for documentation in
support of the payments allegedly made, and specifically invoices, cheque butts
and bank statements in
relation to those payments.  The letter acknowledged
that if the payments were made they would be a debt of the respective estates,
but asserted that any such debt could be set off against the defendant's share
of a debt owed to the late Dr Drummond by the Banarway
Pastoral Company.  Under
cross-examination the defendant admitted that the documentation to support the
payments requested by the
plaintiffs' solicitors had not been provided.  
<P>

64  	The cross-claim was partly dismissed and partly discontinued,
and costs should follow the event unless there is some good reason
for
departing from the usual rule.  Far from providing any such reason, the meagre
facts which I have set out tend to support the
view that the defendant should
pay the plaintiffs' costs of the cross-claim.
<P>

65  	The next question is whether orders should be made to permit the
defendant to recover from the Estate of Elaine Drummond his
own costs of the
cross-claim and the plaintiffs' costs which he is liable to pay them.  In my
opinion this depends upon whether,
according to the principles previously
discussed, the cross-claim was brought by the defendant in his capacity as an
executor or
in a personal capacity in order to obtain a personal benefit.  The
facts do not justify the conclusion that either J M or Elaine
Drummond by their
conduct caused the cross-claim to be brought.  
<P>

66  	The cross-claim as regards the sum of $200,143.04 asserts that
the Estate of Elaine Drummond is indebted to Banarway Pastoral
Company, and
therefore appears to be a form of representative suit on behalf of the
partnership.  To the extent that the defendant
is a partner, the cross-claim
would have benefited him personally had it been successful.  The claim to that
amount could not be
characterised as a claim by an executor for due
administration of the estate.  Rather, it is a claim against the estate, to
recover
a benefit.  The same is true of the claim to recover the sum of
$20,793.67 from both estates.  It is asserted that the defendant
personally
made payments on behalf of those estates.  He now seeks recoupment out of those
estates.  It is likely that when properly
understood, this claim asserts a
right of reimbursement or recoupment of the defendant in his capacity as
executor or trustee, but
nevertheless the assertion of the right is intended to
produce a personal benefit for the defendant.  Similarly, the claim with
respect
to the jewellery is a claim to receive a distribution from the estate
rather than a claim by one executor against co-executors to
enforce due
administration of the estate.
<P>

67  	Since, therefore, the cross-claim was brought for the
defendant's personal benefit, rather than to discharge his duties as
an
executor of the estate, it would not be appropriate to make any order for his
costs to be paid out of the estate, and in any case
I see no proper basis for
doing so having regard to the conduct of the defendant which I have
described.
<P>

68  	The final question is whether the plaintiffs' costs should be
ordered to be paid by the defendant on an indemnity basis, like
the costs of
the summons.  In my view there is insufficient evidence before me to justify my
making such an order.  As to the jewellery,
it is not easy to discern any
proper legal basis for the defendant's attempt to give partial effect to an
apparently non-testamentary
expression of intention by his mother, but it is
understandable for the claim to have been made in litigation between the
children
of the deceased, and the outcome was that the two rings which the
defendant claimed have been delivered up, though without admissions.
 As to the
claim for $200,143.04, it appears that the defendant's position was supported
by an accountant's report, and since that
report is not in evidence, I am not
in a position to conclude that the claim was so unjustified that costs on an
indemnity basis
would be called for.  As to the claim for $20,793.67, while the
plaintiffs' request for documentary support of the alleged payments
was
reasonable and has not been met, I am not prepared on the evidence before me to
infer that the payments could not be proved in
any some other way.  I note that
the claim for this sum has been discontinued rather than dismissed, and it may
be that evidence
will emerge sufficient to persuade the legal personal
representatives of the two estates to admit the claim.  The limitation point
which was raised in the amended defence to the cross-claim was not argued and I
am not in a position to express any opinion on it.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

69  	I propose, therefore, to order that the defendant pay the
plaintiffs' costs of the summons on an indemnity basis, and that
the defendant
as cross-claimant pay the costs of the plaintiffs as cross-defendants on the
cross-claim.  The defendant is not entitled
to an indemnity out of the estate
in respect of any of those costs or his own costs, and so I shall not make any
order permitting
any costs payable by the defendant to be recovered out of
either estate.
