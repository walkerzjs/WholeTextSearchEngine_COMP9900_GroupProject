<b>20329/97   -   STEVEN JOHN McCARTHY  v</b>
<P>

<b>			THE NOMINAL DEFENDANT</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Motor vehicle accident,</b>
<P>

<b>				 liability, damages)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff sues the defendant The Nominal
Defendant for damages for personal injuries sustained by him on 20 November
1991 when
he was driving a semi-trailer, and an unidentified vehicle in front
of him stopped suddenly causing him to take evasive action and
cross onto the
incorrect side of the road and hit an oncoming semi-trailer.  The plaintiff
alleges that his injuries were caused
by the negligence of the driver of the
unidentified motor vehicle.  The defendant denies liability and alleges that if
liability
against it is established the damages to which the plaintiff would
otherwise be entitled ought to be substantially reduced by reason
of the
plaintiff's own contributory negligence.  
<P>

2  	The plaintiff was an interstate truck driver who was employed by
Cook Transport Pty Limited. He regularly drove between Sydney
and Perth on an
express freight route.  He drove a 1982 Kenworth W model prime mover owned by
his employer.  The vehicle which the
plaintiff was driving on the date of the
accident consisted of the prime mover, a sleeping compartment (or dogbox)
directly behind
the prime mover and a trailer.  At the time of the accident the
trailer was unladen.
<P>

3  	On 19 November 1991 the plaintiff had left Perth and had pulled
up at the border village on the Western Australian/South Australian
border.  Ms
Karen Burn was travelling as a passenger with the plaintiff.  At the border
village at about midnight they stopped, ate
a meal and had a couple of hours
rest.  He stopped somewhere for fuel and had a coffee break.  At about 6.30 to
7.00 am the plaintiff
arrived at Port Augusta where he and Ms Burn took a
shower.  After a 45 minute break the plaintiff drove towards Adelaide. The
plaintiff
was as bright as a button and fully alert.  Ms Burn was asleep in the
sleeping compartment located at the back of the prime mover.

<P>

<b><u>Negligence</u></b>
<P>

4  	At about 10.30 am on 20 November 1991 the plaintiff was driving
his Kenworth prime mover articulated vehicle with an unladen
trailer in an
southerly direction along National Highway One on route to Sydney.  The
accident occurred about 100 metres north from
the turn off to Milcowie in South
Australia.  The road was straight and it had a bitumen seal.  There was one
lane in each direction
and a broken centre line.  The weather was dry and
clear.  The road ran north to south and was in good condition.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff's account of the accident is as follows.  He was
travelling  south along the road and there were a couple of cars
and a truck
ahead of him.  On the other side of the road cars and trucks were travelling on
the road towards him.  He had clear vision
for a couple of kilometres ahead.
He had observed a car and truck in front of him travelling in the same
direction for about 15 minutes.
 In front of him was a truck, followed by an
early model blue Holden with black and white number plates (the unidentified
vehicle),
and there were two other vehicles behind the blue Holden and then the
plaintiff's semi-trailer.  The two cars in front of the plaintiff's
semi-trailer overtook the blue Holden.  There was a truck in front of the older
model blue Holden but the truck was not holding up
the traffic.  The two other
vehicles overtook the Holden.  After that occurred, the plaintiff kept his
semi-trailer about three to
four car lengths behind the unidentified vehicle as
this distance would enable him to stop if the unidentified vehicle were to stop
gradually. 
<P>

6  	The plaintiff had been travelling behind the blue Holden car for
some minutes.  He was travelling at about 90 kilometres per
hour.  The speed
limit was 100 kilometres per hour.  According to the plaintiff the unidentified
vehicle stopped dead in the middle
of the southbound lane.  The brake lights at
the rear of the Holden did not light up.  He applied the brakes on his
semi-trailer
hard, the wheels of his prime mover stopped rotating and locked.
If the brake lights on the Holden had come on he would have had
time to pull up
(t 45).  At the time the plaintiff's vehicle braked it was two or three car
lengths behind (t 50).  The trailer and
prime mover locked up and the cabin
started to rotate clockwise.  The cabin of the prime mover was forced over the
white line as
it was being pushed by the trailer.  The plaintiff saw that he
was three to four metres away from an oncoming semi-trailer approaching
from
the north.  The prime mover and the trailer jack knifed.  The right hand side
of the plaintiff's cabin hit the bull bar and
right hand side of a truck being
driven by Mr Cook which was approaching in the opposite direction on its
correct side of the road.
 Mr Phillip Francis Cook had a passenger in his
vehicle, a Mr Franz Ronald Denk.  
<P>

7  	The plaintiff gave evidence that he was not wearing a seat belt
and when he saw that the crash was imminent he either jumped
or was thrown left
to the passenger side of the vehicle.  He said that the windscreen was broken
on the passenger side and the gear
stick had been broken.  The plaintiff's
evidence was that the lower left rear of the cabin and door had been crushed.
He landed in
the passenger floor well in front of the seat.  He did not lose
consciousness.  He heard a lot of crashes and stayed there until
his vehicle
came to rest.  The plaintiff's semi-trailer finished up 100 feet down the road
on the correct side of the road.  The
front wheels of the prime mover were
buried into the dirt.  
<P>

8  	According to the plaintiff the rear wall of the truck's cabin had
caved in such that it would have come into contact with the
driver's seat.  The
driver's seat had been bolted to a metal sheet in the floor of the truck.  The
plaintiff gave evidence that the
bolts had become disconnected in some way and
the whole box had been ripped off the floor.  The driver's seat had come
forward and
left towards the gear stick.  I shall return to consider the
subject of intrusion into the driver's space under the heading of contributory
negligence.  The right mud guard and bonnet which had been made of fibreglass
were damaged.  The driver's door was bent in half.
 The plaintiff climbed out
of the passenger side window and said that he went over to assist the driver in
the other semi-trailer.
 He had blood pouring out of his head.  It is my view
that the plaintiff is mistaken when he said that he went over to assist the
driver of the other semi-trailer as this evidence conflicts with that of Mr
Cook and Mr Denk, the driver and passenger respectively
in the other
vehicle.
<P>

9  	The sleeper box on the plaintiff's vehicle became dislodged and
Ms Burns climbed out of it.  The plaintiff helped her out of
the side door.
The plaintiff denied that he was not paying attention and found himself boring
down on the unidentified vehicle. 
He was positive that the door on the
unidentified vehicle was not open as if that had been the case he would have
taken the door
of the Holden off. The plaintiff acknowledged that if he had
seen the Holden on the road from a distance of 100 metres, he would
have had
enough time and distance to pull up safely.
<P>

10  	The road traffic accident report dated 21 November 1991 (Ex L)
records a similar version of events to that given by the plaintiff.
 It refers
to the vehicle in front of the plaintiff's vehicle "stopping suddenly".  The
SGIC accident report form completed by the
plaintiff on 22 February 1993 (Ex F)
records the car travelling in front of the plaintiff's truck and braking very
suddenly without
warning.  In all other respects these reports are consistent
with the version the plaintiff gave in evidence.
<P>

11  	Mr Cook gave evidence.  He has been a truck driver for 31 years.
He had a good recall of the collision.  Mr Cook was driving
a Kenworth Labourer
with 36 foot wide weight saver tipper which was carrying 22 tons of barley.
About 30 minutes prior to the accident
he had loaded the barley at Milcowie and
was travelling towards the Port Pirie silos.  Mr Cook was heading north and had
just come
over a small rise in the road.  He had clear vision of the straight
road in front.  He did not notice any cars travelling northward
ahead of him.
He was travelling at about 90 kilometres per hour.  He noticed a semi-trailer
travelling south in the opposite direction.
 He places the other semi as
travelling at about 90 kilometres per hour.  Mr Cook's truck was in top gear.
He was not wearing a seat
belt nor was his passenger Mr Denk.  He saw an older
model HQ blue Holden with a white roof travelling south in front of the
semi-trailer.
 The semi was four to five car lengths behind the Holden.  Mr
Cook said that the Holden "dropped anchor" and the semi hit the brakes.
 He did
not believe that the Holden had come to a dead stop before the semi's tyres
started smoking (t 83).  Later Mr Cook said that
the plaintiff dropped anchors
before the Holden became stationary and the Holden was still moving forwards by
the time the plaintiff
slammed on his brakes.  In re-examination Mr Cook said
that he got the impression that the Holden was slowing down and the Holden's
driver did not just hit the brakes and "go voom".  
<P>

12  	Mr Cook saw smoke coming from the tyre hub on the semi and the
semi pulled to the right.  It was his view that the plaintiff
did everything to
avoid hitting the Holden.  There was about 50 metres between the blue Holden
and the semi-trailer when the semi-trailer
"locked her up".  Mr Cook realised
that he was in trouble and had to get his vehicle out of the way so he turned
his vehicle hard
to the left and put his foot on the accelerator so that he was
heading towards a paddock.  He saw the prime mover jack knife and
move towards
his vehicle.  
<P>

13  	Mr Cook heard a double bang, the first bang occurred up near his
cabin.  The first bang dug out the bull bar on the driver's
side and broke the
right hand tank on his vehicle.  The second hit took out the tri-axel on his
trailer.  Both doors of Mr Cook's
semi-trailer were jammed.  He got out the
driver's side window and Mr Denk got out of the passenger side window.  He
could smell
diesel so got up the embankment and sat down.  He saw a Telecom
employee grab Mr McCarthy and put a towel around his head.  He said
that Mr
McCarthy was "A mess mate.  There was blood everywhere."  Mr Cook did not feel
too good either and sustained back injuries
although he did not lose
consciousness.  The blue vehicle was gone by that stage.  
<P>

14  	Mr Cook said that Mr McCarthy had two passengers, a male and a
female.  Both the plaintiff and Mr Denk, Mr Cook's passenger,
disagree and say
that there was only the plaintiff and the female passenger in the plaintiff's
vehicle.  It is my view that Mr Cook
is mistaken about a male passenger being
in the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the accident.  
<P>

15  	Mr Cook said that the door of the blue Holden was not open.  He
said that the Holden was travelling at about 90 kilometres
and that the
plaintiff's truck travelling behind was not gaining on the Holden.  He did not
think that the truck and the Holden were
separated by about 100 metres.  It is
also Mr Cook's view that had the plaintiff's truck been 100 metres behind the
Holden when the
Holden braked the plaintiff could have pulled his truck up
safely.
<P>

16  	Mr Denk who was a passenger in Mr Cook's vehicle gave evidence.
He first saw the Holden a couple of metres ahead.  The first
time that he
realised that there could be a problem was when the semi-trailer which the
plaintiff was driving was 150 metres from
the Holden.  The Holden looked like
it was moving very slowly like it was almost stopped.  He said that he saw the
car door open
when they were only a second or two away from it.  He put it at
being between 100 and 150 metres at least.  He estimated that when
the Holden
door opened the plaintiff's vehicle was 100 metres behind but that could be out
by 10 to 20 metres.  He thought the driver
of the Holden was an elderly
gentleman who opened the door and reached out to picked something up.  The car
door was open for a couple
of seconds then it was closed and the driver
proceeded to drive off.  He gave a similar story to the police in a telephone
interview
on 27 June 1994, which is about two and a half years after the
accident (Ex 4).  According to Dr Denk the Holden started to drive
off and the
truck behind it had already started to brake as it was not driving in a
straight line any more.  He described the impact
between the two semis as being
significant.  He climbed out of the passenger window and saw that the plaintiff
was being attended
to by some Telecom people.  He said that there was no male
passenger in the plaintiff's vehicle.  Mr Denk said that he was not
concentrating
on the road as he was a passenger and was sightseeing as well.
<P>

17  	Mr Denk has a fairly clear recollection about the actual
incident but the rest of his recollection is a little hazy.  When
the Holden
stopped he did not assess the speed of the truck.  Once he realised that the
Holden was stopping he concentrated on the
road because he could see that an
accident was imminent.  He did not think that at the time that the blue vehicle
commenced to stop
the truck was four car lengths behind.  However he was of the
opinion the plaintiff did all that he could to avoid the accident.
<P>

18  	I accept the evidence of the experienced truck drivers, the
plaintiff and Mr Cook that the plaintiff's semi was three to four
car lengths
behind the blue Holden which was a reasonable distance on a National highway.
The plaintiff was travelling within the
speed limit at 90 kilometres per hour.
I find the Holden stopped suddenly without warning middle of the southbound
lane.  The rear
brake lights of the Holden did not light up.  The plaintiff
applied his brakes on his prime mover and did all he could to avoid a
collision
with the Holden.  The brakes in his vehicle locked causing the cabin of his
vehicle to go onto the wrong side of the road
into the path of the oncoming
semi-trailer driven by Mr Cook.  The driver of the unidentified vehicle, namely
the blue Holden had
a duty of care to all the users of the road.  He had a duty
to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable injury to other road users
such as
the plaintiff.  It was foreseeable to the driver of the blue Holden that if he
stopped his car suddenly, without warning
in the middle of a lane on National
Highway One, a truck or other vehicle may not have enough time to bring his
vehicle to a stop
behind the Holden or may swerve to avoid an accident with the
Holden and go onto the wrong side of the road into the path of oncoming
traffic.  The driver of the unidentified vehicle breached the duty of care he
owed to the plaintiff and was negligent.
<P>

<b><u>Contributory Negligence</u></b>
<P>

19  	The defendant alleges that the plaintiff was guilty of
contributory negligence in that he failed to keep a proper lookout;
 failed to
brake soon enough or at all in time to avoid a collision;  failed to take care
for his own safety;  was driving too fast
in the circumstances so as to be able
to perform a normal braking procedure to avoid other vehicles on the road;  was
being inattentive
and failed to wear a seat belt.  The situation of danger was
created by the unidentified vehicle which must bear the far greater
responsibility.  The evidence of Mr Cook and Mr Denk which I prefer, is that
the Holden did not stop dead but stopped suddenly. 
If the plaintiff had
applied his brakes sooner than he did, the amount of damage he suffered may
have been less.  However it is acknowledged
that it is likely on the balance of
probabilities that had the driver of the Holden applied his brakes in the
normal manner, the
plaintiff would have been able to bring his vehicle to a
stop without incident and the accident would not have occurred.  Also if
the
Holden's brake lights had been working, the plaintiff may have had earlier
warning that the car in front was braking.  In considering
the question of
apportionment the court is required to reduce the damages recoverable "to such
extent as the court thinks just and
equitable having regard to the claimant's
share in the responsibility for the damage".  The inquiry is not concerned with
the cause
of the accident but with the cause of damage - see <b><u>Froom v
Butcher</u></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] EWCA Civ 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20QB%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] QB 286</a> at 292-293.  It is my view that the plaintiff's
damages should be reduced by 15% for contributory negligence.
<P>

20  	Both parties tendered experts' reports and those experts were
cross examined.  The main issue in dispute was whether the plaintiff
would have
suffered injuries of the same magnitude had he been wearing either a lap belt
or a lapsash seat belt.  In New South Wales
at the time of the accident truck
drivers did not have to wear a seat belt where the vehicle was over two tonne.
However, it is accepted
that it is safer for road users to wear a seat belt in
case of an accident.  The plaintiff referred to <b><u>Yisrael v Chamberlain
John Deer</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=5%20MVR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">5 MVR 491</a> where Clarke JA stated that it is necessary for a
defendant who seeks to charge a plaintiff with contributory negligence on the
ground
that he was not wearing a seat belt at the relevant time to prove that
the seat belt with which the relevant vehicle was equipped
was available to the
injured person and was in good working order.  The plaintiff admitted that the
prime mover had a seat belt,
but was not asked the type of seat belt ie., lap
or sash seat belt.  However, there was no evidence as to whether or not the
seat
belt was in working order.  Although the plaintiff was not the owner of
the vehicle, he had regular use of it.  I do not infer that
the seat belt was
operative.  The defendant has not made out its case that the plaintiff failed
to wear a seat belt.  I do not make
any reduction for contributory negligence
for failure to wear a seat belt.
<P>

21  	If I am wrong on the onus of proof in relation to the wearing of
the seat belt I will consider whether the plaintiff would
have suffered
injuries of the same magnitude had he been wearing a seat belt.  Both experts
agreed that there was damage to the right
rear of the cabin.  The plaintiff
gave evidence outlined previously that the driver's seat was dislodged and that
the driver's occupant
space was invaded, but from the photographs and the
evidence of Mr Griffiths I do not think this is so.  It is difficult to say
whether
the plaintiff would suffer injuries of a lesser or greater
magnitude.
<P>

22  	Mr Griffiths, a biomedical and mechanical engineer referred to
the accident as being a typical sideswipe incident where the
vehicles
disengaged each continuing in its original direction.  This does not accord
with Mr Cook's version that there were two distinct
bangs and the plaintiff
heard a lot of crashes until they came to a stop.  Mr Griffiths stated:
<P>

<b>"If he had worn a lap only, or a lapsash seatbelt, he would have been
restrained in his seating position, and would have been able
to "ride down" the
impact, while the right front corner of his truck was engaged in the side swipe
incident with the right hand side
of PHILIP COOK's vehicle.  He would not have
been thrown uncontrollably around his truck cabin interior.  He would not have
received
the injury to his C6 vertebra.  Any minor lacerations or bruising he
received would have been considerably reduced in magnitude,
because he would
have had the benefit of "ride down" of the impact, and any contact of his body
with interior surfaces of the vehicle
would not have had the full weight of the
rest of his body behind them."</b>
<P>

23  	Mr Grant Johnson, a consulting engineer stated:
<P>

<b>"The impact configuration and impact forces, in my opinion, are sufficient
for a driver (restrained only by a lap belt) to have experienced
sufficient
upper torso excursion forward and to the left, such that it would result in a
head strike of the left side of the steering
wheel or whatever components were
positioned on the dashboard and centre console to the left of the steering
wheel.  In my opinion
the magnitude of this force was sufficiently great that I
cannot concur with Mr Griffiths' conclusions that it would have resulted
in
only minor bruising and grazing.  This would especially be the case if there
were solid structures in this vicinity which could
have been struck by Mr
McCarthy's head as it travelled forwards and to the left."</b>
<P>

24  	Taking into account the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr Cook,
it is my view that even if the plaintiff had been restrained
by a seat belt in
the driver's seat, it is more likely than not that he would have hit his head
on the steering wheel or dashboard
in the accident and suffered injuries to his
neck.  He would have suffered injuries of a greater magnitude than mere cuts
and bruises.
 I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that had the
plaintiff been wearing a seat belt he would have suffered injuries
of a lesser
magnitude in the accident.
<P>

<b><u>Due inquiry and search</u></b>
<P>

25  	Advertisements were placed in the Recorder, a paper circulating
in the Port Pirie area on 12 April 1994 (Ex K) and the Advertiser,
a paper
circulating in the Adelaide area (Ex J).  They described how the accident
occurred and referred to an unidentified motor
vehicle that may have been a
blue HQ Holden sedan which was involved with a Kenworth truck No NX 32BH and
trailer No TAN 743.  The
advertisements asked that any person who witnessed the
accident or had any information as to the identity of the unidentified vehicle
should contact the plaintiff's solicitors.  It is agreed that there was no
response to those advertisements.  It is also agreed that
the police did not
locate the unidentified vehicle.
<P>

26  	At the scene of the accident the plaintiff asked the person who
rendered assistance to him and Mr Cook if they were able to
assist with the
registration number of the unidentified vehicle.  The plaintiff gave evidence
that he told the police about the blue
Holden and the police said that they had
had a look for the blue Holden.
<P>

27  	At the scene of the accident Mr Cook spoke to a woman who had
been driving a white station wagon.  She told him that an older
man with a limp
who drove a blue Holden had pulled her up at the top of the rise to the south.
The older man told her that there
was a horrific accident and could she get on
her radio and call for help.  Mr Cook passed on the information from this woman
to the
police at the scene.  He also saw two Telecom employees talking to the
police.  Mr Cook spoke to the police about the blue Holden.
 He also had a
conversation with the police on two or three occasions over the next few months
concerning the identity of the driver
of the blue Holden.  He was told that
they had not been successful.  Mr Denk also spoke to the police at the scene of
the accident
and drew a diagram.  Two and a half years later he made a
statement to police and referred to the blue Holden.
<P>

28  	The plaintiff must prove that all reasonable means practicable
were used to try and establish the identity of the vehicle -
see
<b><u>Blandford v Fox</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1944/62.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] NSWStRp 62</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2045%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 45 SR (NSW) 241</a> at 245 and <b><u>Lawrence
v The Nominal Defendant</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20MVR%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 MVR 388.</a>  Where inquiries provide
leads they should be followed up - see <b><u>Slinn v The Nominal
Defendant</u></b> (1964) 112 CLR at 334.  It is necessary for a plaintiff suing
the Nominal Defendant to adduce evidence upon which it can be found
that the
identity of the vehicle which caused the injury cannot after due inquiry and
search be established.  This does not mean
that the inquiry and search must
have been made by or on behalf of the plaintiff.  Nor need there be in every
case some activity,
separate and independent of an inquiry, which can be
designated as a search.  The word "due" accommodates to the circumstances of
the case the nature and extent of the inquiry and search which is required.  In
<b><u>Harrison v. The Nominal Defendant</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2050%20ALJR%20330" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 50 ALJR 330</a> it was held
that it is unnecessary for a plaintiff to take steps that are unlikely to yield
results merely for the purpose of form
or ritual of apparent compliance with
the section.
<P>

29  	In <b><u>Nicholl v NSW Insurance Ministerial Corp</u></b>, Motor
Vehicle Reports SC (NSW), Simpson J<b> </b>says that the combined effect of the
decisions of <b><u>Slinn</u></b> and <b><u>Cavangh</u></b> is that a plaintiff
may rely on enquiries made by others but is not bound by inadequacies in those
enquiries if not in a position
to make or have made appropriate enquiries
himself or herself.
<P>

30  	It is my view that the police were appraised of the description
of the unidentified vehicle immediately after the accident.
 They searched for
the vehicle without success.  No-one at the scene of the accident knew the
registration number of the blue Holden
other than the number plates were black
and white.  Advertisements, admittedly two and a half years after the accident,
were placed
in a local newspaper and other newspapers circulating in South
Australia with no response.  It is my view that the plaintiff has
made all
reasonable means to try and establish the identity of the vehicle.  He has
conducted a due enquiry and search.
<P>

<b><u>Non economic loss</u></b>
<P>

31  	The plaintiff was born 22 August 1953 in Sydney.  He attended
Lynwood Park primary school followed by Blacktown high school.
 In 1969 he left
high school after completing fourth form.  Between 1969 and 1972 he was an
apprentice bricklayer with Oswald Siebalds.
 He completed that apprenticeship
but did not attend a Tafe course.  In 1972 the plaintiff married.  Also in that
year he was issued
with a class 5B licence and commenced employment as a truck
offsider/loader.  
<P>

32  	Between 1972 and 1987 he was employed as a truck driver doing
mainly interstate truck driving.  He was employed on a casual
basis
spasmodically for three to four years by F &amp; J Murphy which has now gone
into liquidation.  In that job he had to secure
his own loading.  He was not
sure how much time he had off but he could work for about one and a half months
and then have a week
off.  He also worked with Wells  Transport and other
different companies.  He says he had plenty of work.
<P>

33  	In 1987 he became employed by Cook Transport Pty Limited as an
interstate truck driver.  Essentially he was travelling between
Sydney to Perth
return on an express freight route.  He worked with his employer every week of
the year and usually each week he
made a return trip from Sydney to Perth.  In
1989 he was issued with a Western Australian licence.  As he had been a truck
driver
nearly all of his working life he intended to continue on in this
employment until the age of 65 years.  He says that he would have
continued to
work with Cook Transport and had a job with them as long as he wanted it.
<P>

34  	Prior to the accident the plaintiff had been in good health.
The plaintiff was taken by ambulance to Port Pirie hospital where
he remained
for a few hours.  X-rays were taken of his skull, cervical spine and forearm.
He was given some pain killers and he was
suffering some pain in his head.
After he was released from hospital he was taken back to the scene of the
accident and collected
some of his possessions.  He was taken to the bus depot
at Adelaide and he caught a bus back to Sydney.  The trip back to Sydney
was
very painful as he could not lift his head up and his head felt like a bowling
ball.  The pain was excruciating.  
<P>

35  	On 24 November 1991 the plaintiff attended Liverpool hospital.
He was suffering a massive pain in his head and neck, pain in
his right forearm
and tingling in his fingers in both hands.  He had x-rays of his head, neck and
chest and came under the care of
Dr Magee-Collett.  The x-ray of the cervical
spine showed that mild changes of cervical spondylosis were present with some
disc space
narrowing at CV6/7 and moderate osteophytic encroachment of the
neural foramina at this level on both sides.  The plaintiff was given
a
philadelphia collar and he was told to keep it on for a period of six weeks.
He was released from hospital and underwent physiotherapy
for about three
weeks.  The plaintiff said that the physiotherapy did not help and he felt like
he was getting worse.
<P>

36  	Between 1991 and 1996 he consulted his local general
practitioner Dr House when he was staying at his mother's house at Blacktown.
He resided with his mother on and off from 1991 to 1996.  During this time he
suffered from neck pain, headaches, back pain and pain
down the back of his
legs.  He was prescribed medication of Endone, Valium, Panadeine Forte and
Prozac to be taken every day.  He
felt that this medication regime did not
help.  While he lived with his mother he said that he was not capable of doing
any work
and spent his time generally laying around the house.  His mother did
his washing, cooking, cleaning and took care of the outside
duties such as
mowing the lawn as the plaintiff said his physical condition left him unable to
assist.  Prior to the accident he
says he would have carried out these duties
himself.  
<P>

<b><u>Subsequent motor vehicle accident on 4 January 1997 and its effect on the
plaintiff's injuries sustained in the 20 November 1991 accident</u></b>
<P>

37  	On 4 January 1997 the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle
accident.  He was a passenger in a motor vehicle which hit
a tree.  He suffered
an orbital blow out of his right eye.  He had the top of his forehead ripped
out and his eye came out.  He had
an operation on his eye and was left with
some scarring on his forehead above his right eye.  As a result of this
accident his vision
is blurred.  This accident heightened the pain and the
soreness in his neck and back but he was sore all over.  He said that prior
to
this accident in 1997 his back and neck could not have got any worse with the
pain.  He could undergo a further operation to his
right eye in relation to the
blurred vision but that operation carries a big risk which he is not prepared
to take.  He says that
even if his eye was fixed he still would not be able to
work because of the pain in his neck and back.  In relation to the 1997
accident
an arbitration award was made on 30 November 1998.
<P>

38  	The plaintiff says that he has had constant lower back pain
every day since 1991.  The plaintiff's version does not accord
with the
contemporaneous records of Drs McGee-Collett and Buckley who saw the plaintiff
after the first accident and before the second
accident.  I accept the
plaintiff's history of back pain as recorded by these doctors.  The plaintiff
denied that he told Drs McGee-Collett
and Buckley that the lower pain only came
upon him now and again.  According to the plaintiff the pain has got
progressively worse.
He denied that the level of neck and back pain became
worse after the 1997 accident.  According to the plaintiff, except for a short
time after the accident the pain reverted to what it was before the 1997
accident except that he now had blurred vision as well.
 The plaintiff says
that for two days of most weeks he ends up in bed because of his back.  The
plaintiff agreed that he told Dr
Webster in 1998 that the absolute worst pain
he had was persistent back pain which had been significantly worsened by the
1997 accident.
<P>

39  	Dr McGee-Collett was the plaintiff's treating neurological
surgeon who initially saw him at Liverpool hospital.  It is not
disputed that
the plaintiff suffered a fracture of the C6 and C7 radioculopathy in the 1991
accident.  The plaintiff's cervical spine
at that time showed early
degenerative change.  The injury to the C7 caused the plaintiff to have
permanent numbness to his right
middle and index fingers.  In February 1992 Dr
McGee-Collett recorded that the plaintiff had a persistently stiff neck but
there
was no mention of any back pain.  In February 1993 Dr McGee-Collett
recorded "nagging neck pain" and bilateral leg pain extending
down posterior
aspect of both thighs as far as the knees.  The plaintiff had intermittent low
back pain.  In May 1996 Dr McGee-Collett
recorded that the plaintiff's major
problem was chronic neck pain and every two to three weeks the plaintiff
experienced a bout of
lower back pain with pain extending down the back of both
thighs as far as the knees for a period of two to three days before spontaneous
resolution.
<P>

40  	Dr Buckley interviewed and examined the plaintiff on 21 April
1996.  Dr Buckley detailed the plaintiff's neck pain as being
constantly
present.  Like Dr McGee-Collett he recorded that the plaintiff's back was not
usually too bad but he did have severe exacerbation
lasting a few days. The
last exacerbation was the month prior to the consultation.  Dr Buckley's
prognosis was that the cervical
and lumber impairment would be associated with
osteoarthritic change and remissions of back and neck pain.  
<P>

41  	When the plaintiff lived at Mulgoa the property had 300 acres of
land and he did not maintain these lawns.  Either Amy Ripti
mowed the lawns or
someone else did.  Ms Ripti did the plaintiff's washing and carried out all the
household chores.  
<P>

42  	In October 1997 the plaintiff moved to Port Macquarie and now
lives in a housing commission house.  He shares the house with
Krystyna Wasiuta
and her daughter.  The plaintiff said that the pain in the lower base of his
back down to his knees stopped him
doing outside work at Mulgoa and Port
Macquarie.  The plaintiff had a motor vehicle and when he lived at Mulgoa he
used it to drive
to the shops.  He still owns a motor vehicle but is unable to
drive it because he cannot turn his head to see what is behind him
so he had to
stop driving.  
<P>

43  	Ms Wasiuta gave evidence.  She has known the plaintiff for nine
years and now is a tenant in the plaintiff's house with her
9 year old
daughter.   Between 1992 and 1997 Ms Wasiuta saw the plaintiff every couple of
months for a few hours.  She said that
during that time when she saw him he was
always complaining about the pain in his lower back and neck.  Since October
1997 to date,
since she has been occupying the same house, she says that the
plaintiff complains about headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, lower
back pain
and pain in his legs when ever he is walking.  Ms Wasiuta said that when the
plaintiff is watching television he has to
hold his head up and he can get
fidgety and uncomfortable.  He lies down every day when the pain comes in his
back.  She attends
to the domestic tasks as the plaintiff does not do anything
around the house.  She has observed him taking medication in the morning
and
afternoon.  She says that after medication he becomes drowsy and he is unable
to focus properly and gets agitated, angry and
anxious.  She said that the
physeptone makes him feel sick.  She said that he cannot drive as the
medication makes him drowsy and
he is not able to turn his neck.  
<P>

44  	In relation to the 1997 accident, his complaints to her were
mainly about his eye and face.  Ms Wasiuta said that the plaintiff
complained
that the accident in 1997 aggravated his neck.  He did not mention his back.
She said that the pain in his neck was always
there from the beginning and that
after the accident it was the same.  
<P>

45  	At the present time the plaintiff says he is not capable of
doing any work.  He suffers from constant lower back pain and neck
pain.  He
has headaches every day and has numbness in the index and second fingers on his
right hand and numbness in his right big
toe.  The pain in his back runs down
his legs to his knees and 18 months ago he started taking physeptone which is a
close derivative
of methadone.  He takes these tablets four times per day and
gains relief for one hour when the tablets kick in.  He had tried swimming
but
it was too painful.  He tried the exercises given to him by a pain clinic but
they were too painful and created more pain.  Physiotherapy
is not of any
benefit to him.
<P>

46  	It is my view that the plaintiff has exaggerated the level of
pain to his lower back he suffers as a result of the first accident.
 I find
that after the first accident the plaintiff suffered lower back which radiated
pain down the back of both thighs as far as
his knees for a few days every
three weeks to a month.  The low back pain would then resolve itself.  Prior to
the 1991 accident
he had some degenerative changes in his lumbar cervical spine
which were asymptomatic.  The plaintiff has suffered constant severe
neck pain
and numbness in his right middle and index fingers caused by the C7
radioculopathy which were caused by the 1991 accident.
 He has had numbness in
the right toe on his right foot since the accident.  His lower back pain was
aggravated by the second accident
which became constant and more severe after
that accident.  His neck pain was always constant and after an initial
heightening of
pain after the second accident it went back to its pre 1997
condition.  He has daily headaches of cervical spine origin.  He needs
to take
painkillers for his neck.  He cannot go back to truck driving or work involving
heavy labour.  He cannot drive a car for
long distances.  The plaintiff's life
has been significantly impaired.  He was 38 years of age at the time of his
accident.  I assess
the plaintiff's non economic loss at 50% of the most
extreme case.  This sum amounts to $136,500.
<P>

<b><u>Past and future loss of earning capacity</u></b>
<P>

47  	The plaintiff submitted that since the accident he has and will
remain totally unfit for any work, ie., he has no residual
earning capacity.
He claims past and future economic loss at the rate of $500 nett per week.  It
is common ground that the plaintiff
is not fit to go back to work as a truck
driver or undertake a job involving heavy labour.  It is agreed that in the
three years
prior to the accident the plaintiff earned an average of $500 nett
per week.  The defendant conceded that the plaintiff was unfit
for work for a
period of six months after the accident.  
<P>

48  	Up until 1997 the plaintiff thought he would get better and go
back to work but he did not.  He says that he is incapable of
working as a
storeman as he is unable to lift anything.  He said that he did not go back to
work prior to 1997 "because if he could
have he would have done so".
<P>

49  	Dr Buckley's view was that the plaintiff's work capacity as at
1996 was that he should not undertake heavy manual labour, lifting
should be
restricted to no more than 16 kg and he should have a five minute break every
hour when he can sit down rather than stand.
 He should not be required to work
for long periods with his arms above shoulder height or at benches lower than
his waist.  Dr Buckley
believed that the plaintiff should be capable of full
time work and is capable of undertaking work such as a shop assistant, light
factory work, stores and similar duties.
<P>

50  	Dr House in his report dated 8 May 1996 expected that the
plaintiff would continue to have pain and restriction of working
ability for
the rest of his life.  Dr McGee-Collett considered that there was no prospect
of the plaintiff returning to his previous
occupation as a truck driver and
little prospect for a significant improvement in his quality of life or
occupation prospects.  Dr
Farey said that as he had not undertaken gainful
employment since his initial injury, statistically he would not return to work.
He holds the view that the second injury ensured that he would not return to
any form of gainful employment.  Dr Douglas in his report
dated 20 August 1997
stated that that as the plaintiff did not have any clerical training he was
probably unfit for clerical or sedentary
work, and secondly if he were to carry
out light physical work he would need to rest frequently , would not be able to
look up, to
bend repeatedly nor lift heavy loads.  Dr Griffith in his report
dated 20 September 1997 and Dr Bencsik in his report dated 27 October
1999 say
that the plaintiff is permanently unable to perform any gainful employment as
the plaintiff would be limited in the ways
outlined by Dr Douglas.  
<P>

51  	Mr O J Burchett, vocational psychologist in his report dated 4
August 1998 says that the plaintiff has transferable skills
in customer
service, time management, communication and organising abilities that could be
applicable in a range of entry level jobs
in the business and clerical fields.
He says that in light of this data and with the qualification mentioned the
plaintiff's most
suitable vocational possibilities are likely to be found in
the associate professionals and intermediate or elementary clerical,
sales and
service workers categories of the Australian Standard Classification of
Occupations.  Some of the specific occupations
that he could consider include
ticket seller, betting agency counter clerk, museum or gallery attendant, hand
packer - light industries,
product assembler - light industries, tourist
information officer, telemarketer, caretaker and car park attendant.  If the
plaintiff
is prepared to undertake further training, he could consider motel
manager, caravan park manager and shop manager.
<P>

52  	It is my view that the plaintiff would have continued to be
employed as a truck driver until the age of 65 years.  The plaintiff
is now a
46 year old man who until the accident on 20 November 1991, was in almost
continual employment as a truck driver.  He has
not worked since this accident.
He has been educated to fourth form at school and has had no other formal
education.  He was unfit
for full time work up to 22 February 1993.  He is
permanently unfit for truck driving or a courier which involve rotation of the
neck and work involving heavy labour. (See report of Dr McGee-Collett).  After
22 February 1993, the plaintiff was capable of part
time work of three days
duration, lesser hours for five days provided the work did not involve heavy
lifting, prolonged standing,
and where he would be able to take rests.  I
assess the plaintiff's loss of earning capacity at $200 per week nett.  The
difference
between the earnings as a truck driver ($500 nett per week) and less
$200 nett per week.  The weekly loss of wages from 22 February
1993 to date and
for future is assessed at $300 nett per week.  
<P>

53  	Past economic loss from 19 November 1991 to 22 February 1993 =
65 weeks x $300 nett = $19,500.
<P>

54  	From 22 February 1993 to date, past economic loss is calculated
at 52 x 6 + 44 weeks = 356 at $300 nett per week = $106,800.
<P>

55  	Future economic loss is 19 years (multiplier 646.2) at $300 nett
per week less 15% for vicissitudes = $164,781.00.
<P>

<b><u>Out-of-pocket expenses</u></b>
<P>

56  	The amount claimed is for the sum of $1,688.05 which is
repayable to the Health Insurance Commission (Ex A).  I allow this
sum.
<P>

<b><u>Future medication</u></b>
<P>

57  	The plaintiff currently takes physeptone for pain.  It costs
$13.30 per week (t 28).  It is my view that as a result of the
accident the
plaintiff will continue to experience pain in his neck and to a lesser extent
in his lower back and will required pain
killers for the rest of his life.  I
allow this sum $13.30 x multiplier 870.8 = $11,581.64.
<P>

<b><u>Future surgery and medical treatment</u></b>
<P>

58  	In 1996 Dr Buckley opined that the plaintiff may undergo one
cervical discectomy and anterior fusion, one lumbar laminectomy
and discectomy
during his life.  These operations cost $8,026 each in 1996.  Dr Bencsik
suggested that a surgical cervical fusion
may benefit the plaintiff but he
believed that the plaintiff would be unlikely to accept the surgical procedure.
The costs of a spinal
fusion is $10,050.  Dr Brimage in his report dated 28
October 1999 says that there is a greater than 50% chance of the plaintiff
undergoing surgery to the spine some time in the next 15 years and costs it at
$10,000.  Dr Farey in his report dated 2 October 1998
is of the opinion that
the plaintiff is unlikely to require surgery in the future.  The plaintiff did
not find physiotherapy or the
pain clinic of any assistance so I would not
allow any amounts for these items.  Although Dr Buckley suggested spinal
surgery prior
to the second accident, the need for the operation may have
become more of a reality after the second accident.  It is unlikely that
the
plaintiff would choose to undergo spinal surgery.  However, he may change his
mind in the future.  In accordance with <b><u>Malec v J C Hutton</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
169 CLR 638</a> an award for damages should reflect this possibility.  I make an
allowance of $3,500.
<P>

59  	Dr Brimage suggested that it would be in the plaintiff's best
interest to be treated and monitored by a neurologist who could
prescribe
medication such as Epilim, amitriptyline or buclizire.  The costs of these
medications used would approximate at $1,000
per year and the visits would
approximate at $1,000 per year.  The plaintiff does not seem to gain much
benefit from medication.
 I have already allowed for the cost of Physeptone.
He may in the future use a different medication which costs the same.  However
I agree that as the plaintiff appears to be on a very strong painkiller, it is
reasonable that he be allowed to visit a specialist
every couple of years.  I
will also make some allowance for additional medication in the future.  Doing
the best I can, I allow $15,000.
<P>

60  	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs as agreed or
assessed.
