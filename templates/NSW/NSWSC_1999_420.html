<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - particulars of matter complained of)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In these proceedings eleven plaintiffs sue the first and second
defendants claiming damages for defamation arising
from three publications in
"<i>The Greek Herald</i>" published on 20 January and 10 and 11 February this
year.
<P>

2	The plaintiffs at the relevant times say they were the directors of
Canterbury Marrickville Olympic Soccer Football Club Limited.
<P>

3	Each of the three publications deals with the subject matter of the sale by
the club of certain real estate, to put it in very
general terms.
<P>

4	The first matter complained of appears from annexure A1 to the statement of
claim to take up three columns in the Greek language
which have been translated
into three and a half pages of English text in annexure A2.
<P>

5	The second matter complained of is again three columns in the Greek language
which has been rendered into a page and a half of
English.
<P>

6	The third is three columns rendered into just over one page of English.
<P>

7	The references to column length in the original Greek publication do not and
cannot fairly indicate the length, in fact, of the
publications as, no doubt,
the annexures have been subject to reduction or possibly even expansion in the
photocopying process. 
The point is, however, that each matter complained of
cannot be said to be of undue or any great length.  The second point that can
be made about each matter complained of for the purposes of the present
application is that the language used by the publishers is
fairly clear in what
it is saying.  
<P>

8	The present dispute arises in connection with a matter that is not commonly
the subject of contention:  it is the adequacy of
particulars provided by the
defendants in response to a request in the following terms: "<i>Nominate the
part or parts of the first matter complained of alleged to give rise to each of
the imputations complained of.  Please
provide a specific answer for each
imputation pleaded</i>".
<P>

9	Using that as an example, the response was provided:  "<i>The plaintiffs rely
on the whole of the material complained of to convey each and every
imputation</i>".
<P>

10	There is, of course, an obligation upon a plaintiff that is well-known;
namely, to plead and particularise his case in such a
way as to clearly inform
the relevant defendant of the case that defendant has to meet.
<P>

11	In a defamation action the cause of action is  constituted by the imputation
alleged to be carried by the particular matter published.
 In the usual course
of events a request for particulars in the form to which I have referred is
made and a not uncommon response
is to the effect:  "<i>The plaintiff relies
upon the whole of the matter complained of as giving rise to imputation X and,
in particular, paragraphs A, B,
C and D</i>".
<P>

12	Does the failure of the plaintiff to adopt that usual approach amount to a
failure properly to particularise its case for the
purpose to which I have
referred?  In some instances clearly it will not.  If the publication was to
the effect "<i>the plaintiff is a thief</i>" and the imputation is the
"<i>plaintiff is a thief"</i>, there would hardly be any need for an exchange
of particulars on this subject at all, one would think.  
<P>

13	Where the publication sued upon is, for example, a television or radio
broadcast, a "<i>transient</i>" publication, that is, it passes through the
relevant senses from beginning to end, the issue may be important by reason of
the recipient
not having, at the one time, the whole of the publication before
him or her.
<P>

14	A response to the request for particulars in the form I have used which
refers both to the whole of the matter and relevant parts
does not and cannot
bind the plaintiff in the presentation of its case to those parts to the
exclusion of others which make up the
whole.  Also it has to be acknowledged
that it would be imprudent for a plaintiff, unless the case was abundantly
clear, to say in
respect of imputation X, "<i>The plaintiff relies only on
paragraph Y of the published matter</i>".
<P>

15	The question to be answered in the current application can be framed:
"<i>are the defendants uninformed to the point of embarrassment by the response
that in respect of each and every imputation the plaintiff
relies upon the
whole of the matter complained of;  are the defendants uninformed, in a
reasonable sense, by such a response?"</i>
<P>

16	Whilst the defendants might take the view that it would be of some utility
to be provided with further information, it does not
necessarily follow that
its non-provision amounts to an inadequate statement of the plaintiffs'
case.
<P>

17	In respect of the first publication sued upon, each plaintiff has pleaded
seven imputations and the view to which I have come
is that it could hardly be
clearer that those imputations, and each of them, fairly can be attributed to
the whole of the matter
complained of.  In the course of submissions the
exercise of identifying particular paragraphs, for example in relation to
imputations
4(f) and (g), was easily dealt with, but the publications on their
face are such that the defendants cannot be embarrassed in the
way to which I
have referred by a plaintiff going through what appears to me to be an
unnecessary exercise to isolate one part of
an allegedly disparaging
publication from beginning to end that might lend particular support to one
imputation.
<P>

18	Subject to any discrete argument as to capacity which in my view would not
be affected by the form of particulars as described,
or any discrete argument
as to form, the Court here is not concerned with principles relating to
material qualifying the complexion
of the imputations vis a vis the respective
publications sued upon.
<P>

19	Insofar as it is to be taken that in each case the whole of the matter is
pleaded, the principles referred to in<b> <i>Gordon v Amalgamated Television
Services Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 410</a> are not directly apposite.  I do
not find that the pleading or the method of particularisation in this case in
the light of the form,
content and tenor of each publication embarrasses the
defendants or requires them to embark upon any investigatory process to
identify
the case they have to meet in respect to each publication of each
plaintiff.
<P>

20	The application for further particulars is dismissed.
<P>

21	I will note that the plaintiff will be moving the Court under SCR Pt 31 r 2
for determination of whether the matters complained
of are capable of conveying
the imputations pleaded.  I will stand that matter over to Friday 11 June for
argument.
<P>

22	The defendants are to pay the plaintiffs' costs of today.  In the event that
the defendants wish to move the Court on the same
basis or to make any
application in relation to issues of form with respect to the imputations,
notice thereof is to be given to
the plaintiffs by no later than 5 pm on Friday
21 May.
<P>
