<i>Friday, 23 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4192/98	NAOMI ANNE ARMSTRONG   -v-   GLORIA DAWN ARMSTRONG</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 7 October 1998, the plaintiff seeks an
order for provision for her maintenance, education and advancement
in life out
of the estate of her late father David Murray Armstrong (to whom I will refer
as the "deceased")
<P>

3   	The deceased died, aged about 58, on 14 January 1998. He
left a will made in July 1996, and letters of administration with
such will
annexed were being granted on 20 July 1998 to Gloria Dawn Armstrong, a
beneficiary named in the will, who is the defendant
to the present proceedings.
The executors designated in that will, which appears to have been prepared by
the deceased personally
without the benefit of legal advice, renounced
probate.
<P>

4   	By that will, the deceased left to the plaintiff a legacy
of $5,000. He gave a collection of gramophone records to his niece,
and gave
the residue of his estate to the defendant.
<P>

5   	The defendant is the de facto widow of the deceased. They
lived together for a period of about four years, or perhaps a little
less, up
to the time of his death. The assets in the estate consisted essentially of the
entitlements to the deceased resulting from
his employment with the Newcastle
City Council, those entitlements (including accrued holiday pay, long service
leave, sick leave)
being in the amount of $50,601, together with the interest
of the deceased in the estate of his late father, Robert Murray Armstrong,
that
interest consisting of a one third share in certain real estate situated at
Cessnock Street, Cessnock. I will later return to
a consideration of the value
of that one third interest.
<P>

6   	It is also of relevance that, in consequence of the death
of the deceased, the defendant received a superannuation benefit,
which however
came to her directly and did not form part of the estate of the deceased. That
superannuation benefit was in the sum
of $159,555.
<P>

7   	After allowance had been made for the payment of the legacy
to the plaintiff, and for the payment of various costs and  administrative
expenses relating to the estate of the deceased, the present assets of that
estate consist of moneys totalling $36,082 and the interest
of the deceased in
the estate of his late father.
<P>

8   	It will be appreciated that there must be paid out of the
assets of the estate, the costs of the defendant of the present proceedings,
estimated to total slightly under $20,000, and further that, in the event that
she should be successful in these proceedings, the
costs of the plaintiff also
must be paid out of the estate. Those costs are estimated to be in the amount
of $25,000.
<P>

9   	The plaintiff was born on 5 December 1975. She is presently
21 years of age. Her parents separated in 1977, before the plaintiff
was aged
two, as a result an incident described in the affidavit evidence of the
plaintiff's mother.  The plaintiff's parents divorced
in 1985. The plaintiff
was brought up by her mother. Therefore, for all practical purposes, she had no
contact with the deceased
from the time when her parents separated, whilst the
plaintiff was still an infant, until the death of the deceased.
<P>

10   	The plaintiff until February of this year, had been in
employment at McDonalds. She commenced maternity leave on 1 February
1999, and
on 10 March, 1999 there was born to the plaintiff and to her de facto spouse,
Karl Ailwood, a son. The plaintiff was paid
maternity leave until 31 March
1999, but since that date her income has been the amount of $89 a fortnight
paid by CentreLink and
comprising what has been described as a staying at home
allowance and a family payment. The plaintiff will be entitled to resume
her
employment with McDonalds within the period of twelve months from the time she
commenced her maternity leave. She said she expects
to return to work, but is
not sure when that will be.
<P>

11   	Evidence was placed before the Court concerning the
financial material and circumstances of the plaintiff and of her de facto
spouse. In March of this year they purchased a house property at 45 Neville
Street, Mayfield, in which they and their newborn son
currently reside.  That
house property was purchased for $90,000 and was largely funded by a housing
loan, upon which there is presently
outstanding an amount of about $87,000.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff in her affidavit sworn last week, 15 July
1999, brings up to date the financial and material circumstances of
herself and
her de facto spouse. Apart from her joint liability with Mr Ailwood for the
housing loan, the plaintiff has a credit
card liability of $1,000. Mr Ailwood
has, in addition to his joint liability on the housing loan, a loan from
Australian Guarantee
of  $1,500, a personal loan from the St George Bank of
$5,500 and a car loan from the St George Bank, the present pay out figure
of
which is $20,872.
<P>

13   	Mr Ailwood is employed as a territory manager by a
company, Office Organization Pty Ltd, for which he has worked for the 
past six
years. In the last financial year, his gross income from that employment was
$43,080. He in addition received a car allowance
of $15,650, and he paid income
tax of $11,539. His net income on those figures was $47,139.
<P>

14   	Evidence was given concerning the financial and material
circumstances of the defendant. I have already referred to the fact
that she
received, as a result of the death of the deceased, a superannuation payment
totalling $159,555. The totality of that amount
has been expended by the
defendant. The largest items in that expenditure were the acquisition of what
is described as an "on site
van and site", in the total amount of $66,000, and
a motor vehicle being a Mazda Astina, purchased new for $33,000. In addition,
the defendant purchased replacement furniture and furnishings for a little over
$10,000, and paid loans which were due by her in
amounts totalling $2,680. The
defendant gave assistance to her children --- she had been married and divorced
before she met the
deceased, and has three adult children. The defendant made
gifts to her two sons totalling $26,500, and she has also paid for her
daughter's wedding, which cost her about $6,000. The balance of the
superannuation benefit which the defendant received has been
used by her on
ordinary living expenses, including clothing and other personal items.
<P>

15   	The defendant receives an income by way of a social
security pension in an amount presently $336.50 per fortnight, being described
as unemployment payments. The defendant was born on 2 May 1954 and is presently
aged 45 years. 
<P>

16   	I have already referred to the fact that the plaintiff had
no contact with her father, the deceased, from early infancy until
the death of
the deceased. No submission was made on behalf of the defendant that that lack
of contact between the plaintiff and
her father in any way affected or reduced
any entitlement the plaintiff might have to receive from the estate of her
father a benefit
in addition to that given to her by his will. 
<P>

17   	The plaintiff as a daughter of the deceased is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such she has the standing
to bring the present proceedings.
<P>

18   	In approaching the claim of the plaintiff, the Court must
look not only to her own financial and material circumstances, but
also to the
financial and material circumstances of her de facto spouse, and must approach
the claim of the plaintiff in the light
of any competing claims upon the bounty
of the deceased. In the circumstances of this case the only such competing
claim is that
of the defendant, the de facto widow of the deceased, who it will
be appreciated, is the designated object of the testamentary beneficence
of the
deceased. Indeed, the widow under the terms of his will receives the entirety
of the estate, apart from the legacy to the
plaintiff and the gift of specific
chattels to the niece.
<P>

19   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
deceased was under an obligation to provide for her, not only as
a result of
the mere fact of paternity but also as a  result of any provision made by him
whilst the plaintiff was growing up being
of what might be described as a less
than generous nature. Apparently he did pay maintenance as required for the
plaintiff during
her childhood but there is a suggestion that it was his own
mother who was the ultimate source of those maintenance payments. Certainly
the
plaintiff did not receive from her father, whilst she was growing up, the
emotional and material support that one would usually
expect a child to receive
from a parent. However, both parties appear to have been content that this case
should be conducted essentially
upon the basis of the financial needs of the
plaintiff and the competing entitlements of the defendant.
<P>

20   	It has been submitted that the total income of the
plaintiff and of her de facto spouse is such that she has not established
any
relevant need, and that in consequence she is not entitled to receive any
additional benefit from the estate of her father. I
do not agree with that
submission. The plaintiff and her de facto spouse have recently become parents.
The plaintiff's income since
she ceased to receive her wages from McDonalds at
the end of March 1999 has been minimal. Whilst Mr Ailwood is receiving a
reasonable
income, especially when the car allowance is added to his salary,
nevertheless that salary must maintain two adults and a new baby.
From that
salary they must meet the payments on the housing loan for the house property
which they have recently acquired.
<P>

21   	The defendant, as the de facto widow of the deceased and
as the recognised chief object of the testamentary beneficence of
her former
spouse, is entitled to be regarded as a person whose claim is in substantial
competition with that of the plaintiff. The
circumstances of the defendant
cannot enhance the plaintiff's claim, they can only have the effect of
reducing, or even extinguishing,
any provision and entitlement which the
plaintiff might otherwise have established.
<P>

22   	One of the problems in this case, and a problem which I
have already signalled earlier in this judgment, relates to the assets
in the
estate. Apart from the amount of $37,675, being the balance of the leave
entitlements and wages of the deceased, the only
other asset is the entitlement
of the deceased in the estate of his late father, the deceased's father, who
died on 2 April 1990.
The various pieces of real estate which comprise the
estate of the deceased's father, have not yet been able to be sold. Evidence
was placed before the Court by a valuer that the present total value of those
pieces of real property is $220,000. However, the deceased's
sister, who is one
of the administrators of the estate of the deceased's late father, gave
evidence and was cross-examined concerning
the offers to purchase and the
intention of the administrators of that estate to sell the real property. It
would appear that an
oral offer of $470,000 was received relatively recently
for that real property but that the estate agent, upon whose advice the
administrators
rely and who has the responsibility of attempting to sell that
property, advised that that oral offer should not be accepted, in
the hope,
apparently, that a higher amount could be obtained.
<P>

23   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that the
Court should accept the evidence of the valuer and should adopt
a figure of
$220,000 as the value of the real property, and that the Court should disregard
the suggestion that the property was
worth $470,000 or even somewhat more than
that figure. If the amount of $220,000 is adopted then the entitlement of the
deceased
would be $73,333, being one third of that figure. It should be
appreciated however that if eventually the estate of his late father
can sell
the property for a higher figure, then the interest of the deceased will rise
accordingly.
<P>

24   	It seems to me, in all the circumstances of this case,
that the plaintiff has established an entitlement to receive from the
estate of
her late father a further legacy additional to that of $5,000 given to her by
the will and which she has already received.
The amount of that further legacy
however should not be such as to reduce in any significant fashion the benefit
which the defendant
has received or is entitled to receive either under the
terms of the will of the deceased or as a consequence of the death of the
deceased. The defendant under the terms of the will of the deceased will of
course be entitled to receive the entirety of the interest
of the deceased in
the Cessnock property. Thus far she has received no practical benefit in
consequence of that entitlement.
<P>

25   	I consider that it is appropriate that the plaintiff
should receive out of the estate of the deceased a further legacy, such
further
legacy being in the sum of $40,000 and I propose so to order. I propose further
to order that that further legacy should
be borne by the assets in the estate
of the deceased which consist of his interest in the estate of his late
father.
<P>

26   	DISCUSSION ABOUT COSTS AND INTEREST ON THE LEGACY.
<P>

27   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that in addition the benefit given to her by the will of the late
David Murray Armstrong ("the deceased"), the plaintiff
receive a further
legacy, in the sum of $40,000, such further legacy to be borne by the asset in
the estate of the deceased being
the interest of the deceased in the estate of
the late Robert Murray Armstrong, and that such further legacy not bear
interest if
paid on or before 23 January 2000, and, if not so paid, to bear
interest at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

2.	 I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of
the deceased.
