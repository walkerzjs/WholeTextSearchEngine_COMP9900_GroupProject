<b><u>70052/98 - Regina  v  Elizabeth Anne BURDIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR VERDICT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> 	On 18 June instant Elizabeth Anne Burdis,
["the accused"], was presented for trial in this Court upon an indictment
containing three
counts.
<P>

2  	<i>The first count in the indictment</i> charges the accused with
having murdered her father, Ronald John Burdis, on 29 March 1998 at Rous. In
order to establish this charge,
the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt
all of the following:
<P>

(i)	The death in fact of Mr. Burdis;
<P>

(ii)	An act of the accused causing such death;
<P>

(iii)	An accompanying intent of any of the kinds stipulated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(1)(a)</a>
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> (NSW)</b>.
<P>

3  	<i>The second count in the indictment</i> charges that the
accused at the same time and place wounded her mother, Dorothy Edna Burdis,
with intent to murder her. In order
to establish this charge, the Crown must
prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the following:
<P>

(i)	A wounding in fact of Mrs. Burdis;
<P>

(ii)	An act of the accused causing such wounding;
<P>

(iii)	An accompanying intent to murder, being any of the types of intent
nominated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 18(1)(a)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> (NSW)</b>.
<P>

4  	<i>The third count in the indictment</i> charges the accused with
having maliciously wounded, at the same time and place, her sister, Helen
Margaret Burdis. In order to establish
this charge, the Crown must prove beyond
reasonable doubt all the following:
<P>

(i)	A wounding in fact of Miss Burdis;
<P>

(ii)	An act of the accused causing such wounding;
<P>

(iii)	Accompanying malice in the accused.
<P>

The accused, upon arraingnment, pleaded not guilty to each of those three
charges.
<P>

5  	On 18 March 1999 the accused signed a document purporting to be
an election made pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act
1986</a> (NSW)</b>. The document is Exhibit B in the present proceedings. I am
satisfied, and was so satisfied at the time of the arraignment of the
accused,
that all relevant requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(1)</a> of that Act have been complied
with. I proceeded, therefore, on Friday last to try the accused in the absence
of a jury.
<P>

6  	No oral evidence was adduced at the trial, it being agreed by the
learned Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor and by learned counsel
for the accused
that the trial should proceed upon the basis of agreed documents. 
<P>

7  	One of those documents is a statement of facts, which is in
evidence as Exhibit C. It says all that needs to be said by way
of summarising
the relevant objective facts, and I therefore reproduce it as follows:
<P>

"About 7.55 pm on the 29 March, 1998 the accused was in her bedroom of her
parents home at a property at 322 Rous Road, Rous. Also
in the dwelling was her
father Ronald John Burdis, 67 years old, her mother Dorothy Edna Burdis, 62
years old, her sister Helen Margaret
Burdis, 24 years old and the accused's
daughter Elizabeth Sharlot Burdis who is 9 years of age. The accused's mother
Dorothy went
into the kitchen to prepare herself some food and noticed that
food she had prepared earlier had been eaten. Mrs. Burdis commented
loudly
about the accused having eaten the food. At this point the accused left her
bedroom and walked to the kitchen area. The accused
then selected a knife
approximately 15 centimetres in length from the kitchen area and then walked
into the loungeroom. At this stage
the accused's mother was standing facing
away from the accused. The accused walked up behind her mother Dorothy and
commenced to
stab her with great force in the upper right side of her back. The
accused delivered at least four stab wounds which went right through
her
mothers back exiting the front of her shoulder. Mrs. Dorothy Burdis then
collapsed forward with blood flowing profusely from
the knife wounds. The
accused's father Ronald Burdis then came to the assistance of his wife and
attempted to take hold of his daughter
by the arms. The accused then stabbed
her father with the knife in the upper chest area. Mr. Burdis collapsed on the
floor having
been fatally wounded by the knife wound. Two wounds were later
observed one on the upper left side of the chest and one on the upper
right
side of the deceased. The accused's sister Helen Margaret Burdis then came to
assist her mother and father and at this point
the accused raised the knife at
her sister and said, "Do you want some too?". The accused then stabbed her
sister in the chest area,
the blade deflected off the sternum and punctured her
lung. Helen Burdis then yelled out to the accused's daughter Elizabeth, 9 years
old to run from the house to across the road to a neighbours to get help. Both
Mrs. Dorothy Burdis and Helen Burdis then managed
to leave the house to the
front verandah to ensure the safety of the child. At this stage the accused
calmly walked back into the
kitchn and went to the sink and washed blood from
the knife and her hands. Her father remained lying deceased on the loungeroom
floor.
The accused then rang the ambulance and openly declared that the
ambulance was required as she had stabbed three people. Ambulance
and Police
arrived a short time later and the accused was spoken to. Ambulance officers
then conveyed Mrs. Dorothy Burdis and Helen
Burdis to Lismore Base Hospital for
treatment. Mrs. Dorothy Burdis was in a serious but stable condition having
lost a considerable
amount of blood and Mrs. Helen Burdis was transported by
helicopter to Brisbane Hospital with a punctured lung. The accused was spoken
to firstly at the scene and then interviewed by electronic interview at Lismore
Police Station."
<P>

8  	A considerable volume of additional documentary material was
placed before the Court in connection with the relevant objective
facts and
circumstances surrounding the offences charged in all three counts of the
indictment. I have read and considered the whole
of that material; and I am
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved the <i>actus
reus</i> charged in each of the three counts. The contrary was not contended at
the trial.
<P>

9  	The only issue that was raised at the trial was whether the
accused's case falls within section 38 of the <b>Mental Health (Criminal
Procedure) Act 1990</b>. That section is, so far as is at present relevant, in
the following terms:
<P>

"If, in an indictment .................... , an act ......................is
charged against a person as an offence and it is given
in evidence on the trial
of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be
responsible, according to
law, for his or her action at the time when the act
was done..................., then, if it appears .............., that the
person
did the act .................. charged, but was mentally ill at the time
when the person did .................. the same, ...........(the
tribunal of
fact at the trial) ....................must return a special verdict that the
accused person is not guilty by reason
of mental illness."
<P>

10  	The onus of proof of the fact of mental illness as thus defined
rests upon the accused. The relevant standard of proof is proof
on the balance
of probabilities.
<P>

11  	The law relating to this special defence of mental illness is
well established. It was stated, in its fundamental form, as
long ago as 1843
and in the following terms:
<P>

"Was the accused at the time the offence was committed suffering from a defect
of reason, from a disease of the mind such as not
to know the quality and
nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what
he was doing was wrong."
<b>Regina v McNaughton </b>(1843) 8 ER 718 at 722.
<P>

12  	As to the concept of knowledge in an accused person of the
wrongfulness of the relevant act, the foundational principle is
stated as
follows by the High Court of Australia in <b>Sodeman v R</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/75.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 75</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2055%20CLR%20192" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 55 CLR 192</a>
at 215:
<P>

"If the disease so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with
some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the
moral quality of what he is
doing he is prevented from knowing what he does is wrong."
<P>

13  	Such is the relevant law. As to the relevant facts, I have had
regard, in particular, to four reports provided by four different
expert
witnesses in the field of psychiatry. 
<P>

14  	<i>Dr. Igor Petroff</i> has been treating the accused since June
1989. His report is Exhibit D in the present proceedings. His conclusions are
expressed
as follows:
<P>

"<b>Opinion</b>
<P>

Elizabeth Burdis is an intellectually dull woman who suffers from <b>Chronic
Schizophrenia </b> for the past 14 years. Her illness was such that she could
never be without medication and would relapse as soon as it was stopped.
Prior
to the tragedy in March, Elizabeth had become chaotic with her medication and
had relapsed again. This previously kind and
gentle woman whose hobby in
childhood was dressing up guinea pigs, could only have been psychotic to have
attacked her family and
particularly her father, of whom she was very fond, and
who was her closest ally.
<P>

Besides her psychosis, there were no predictive factors indicative of
dangerousness.
<P>

There is a very strong clinical impression that whilst novel anti-psychotics
produce superior results, when patients stop them,
their psychosis are much
more florid and bizarre. At the time that I last saw Elizabeth Burdis this was
not evident, but my contact
with the Prison Hospital indicated that Elizabeth
was very floridly psychotic."
<P>

15  	<i>Dr. Michael Giuffrida</i> is a Consultant Psychiatrist at the
Mullawa Correctional Centre. Dr. Giuffrida has submitted a report, which is
Exhibit E in the
present proceedings. Dr. Giuffrida notes in his report that he
did not have, at the time of writing the report, relevant hospital
discharge
summaries; any report from Dr. Petroff; or any other relevant documents.
Subject to those limitations, Dr. Giuffrida's
own view was that at the time of
his examination of the accused, which appears to have been in April 1998, the
accused:
<P>

"(a)lthough she is obviously quite psychotic and has committed a serious
crime......... is probably not presently mentally ill within
the meaning of the
<b>Mental Health Act NSW 1990</b>, because she does not represent a serious
harm to herself or others at this time."
<P>

16  	Dr. Giuffrida does, however, conclude his report as follows:
<P>

"I have explained to Ms Burdis that the local Court has requested a psychiatric
report from me and I thought that it would be in
her interest to provide such a
report to the court <i>on the basis that she was undoubtedly in my opinion
suffering from an acute psycyhotic illlness at the time of the offence and in
my view probably not able to exercise rational judgment</i>." [emphasis
added]
<P>

17  	<i>Dr. Robert Delaforce</i> submitted at the request of the
Director of Public Prosecutions a report dated 14 March 1999. This report is a
lengthy and carefully
crafted one, and I have found it of great assistance for
present purposes. Dr. Delaforce expresses his agreement with the diagnosis
made
by Dr. W. Lucas to whose report I shall refer presently. Dr. Delaforce
expresses his support for the proposition that the accused
was at the material
time mentally ill in the sense contemplated by section 38 of the <b>Mental
Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act</b>. More particularly, Dr. Delaforce
expresses these views:
<P>

"Her active features of Schizophrenia at the time of the offences result in a
defect of reason caused by disease of the mind. She
seemed to know what she was
doing at the time of the offences, stabbing her parents and her sister Helen.
However, this was clouded
by her talk of all 3 being "robots" at the time of
the stabbing. Also she knew that it was wrong to stab them. However, because of
her active Schizophrenia at the time of the offences she was incapable of
reasoning with some degree of calmness as to the wrongness
of the acts or of
comprehending the nature or significance of the acts."
<P>

And later:
<P>

"In short, at the time of the offences she felt under threat of her own life
and was given advice about how to stab her parents
and sister, advice or
influence that may have partly derived from auditory hallucinations, such that
overall she had irrational beliefs
and could not reason appropriately about the
wrongness of the acts of stabbing or comprehend the nature of those acts."
<P>

18  	<i>Dr. William Lucas</i> submitted to the accused's solicitor a
report dated 7 March 1999. It is sufficient for present purposes to quote Dr.
Lucas' opinion,
which is as follows:
<P>

"I believe Ms Burdis has the defence of mental illness to the charges. At the
time of the stabbing she was suffering from a defect
of reason due to a disease
of the mind, chronic paranoid schizophrenia. As a result, although she knew the
physical nature and quality
of her acts, she was unable to reason about them
with a moderate degree of sense and composure. She believed she had no choice
in
what she did. She gave me many reasons for her actions and, with the
exception of her anger at being accused of gluttony, all these
were of a
delusional nature and, importantly, a number were concerned with beliefs that
her daughter was being sexually abused and
prostituted. Her father was not the
initial target in the attacks but he was the only one to die. Ms Burdis had
elaborate delusional
beliefs about his behaviour and activities and she had
been thinking for weeks about stabbing him along with her mother and sister.
<P>

Ms Burdis will require long term psychiatric treatment and this needs to be
received in a hospital as a forensic patient with oversight
by the Mental
Health Review Tribunal. Although she has not offended violently before, the
nature of her illness and her actions on
the day in question are such that
lengthy inpatient treatment is likely to be necessary."
<P>

19  	I accept the whole of the body of expert evidence that I have
summarised from the four reports which are, respectively, Exhibits
D, E, S and
T in the present proceedings.
<P>

20  	I am comfortably satisfied on the probabilities that the accused
has made good the proposition that, as to each of the offences
charged against
her in the indictment, she is not guilty by reason of mental illness in the
sense for which provision is made by
section 38 of the <b>Mental Health
(Criminal Proceedings) Act 1990 (NSW)</b>. I return, as to each count in the
indictment, a special verdict in those terms.
<P>

21  	Section 39 of that same statute requires that, a special verdict
having been returned in terms of section 38, there be made
an order that the
accused <i>"be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks
fit until released by due process of law"</i>.
<P>

22  	The accused is, and has been for some time, detained in the
Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital. She was arrested on 29 March
1998, and
has been treated by the authorities as a mental patient since that date. It
seems that she has been treated as a forensic
patient since some later date. I
was informed that there is no impediment to her continued detention at the
Bunya Unit of the Cumberland
Hospital. I order therefore, and pursuant to
Section 39 of the <b>Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1900</b>, that
the accused be detained at the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital as a
forensic patient, and until released by due process
of law.
<P>

23  	It is important to explain for the public information generally,
but in particular for the information of the members of the
accused's immediate
family, that the special verdicts which the Court has returned, and the
consequential detention order which the
Court has made, do not entail that the
accused will simply walk free in the way that happens when an accused person is
found not
guilty by a verdict other than a special verdict dependent upon a
finding of mental illness. What will happen in the wake of the
order made by
this Court is that the accused will become a forensic patient in the sense
contemplated by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/mha1990128/" class="autolink_findacts">Mental Health Act 1990</a></b>; and she will be dealt with
in the manner for which provision is made in the detailed statutory scheme that
is set out in Chapter
5 of that Act. Put very simply, that means that the
accused will come under the constant supervision and monitoring of the Mental
Health Review Tribunal, a body constituted by section 252 of the Act, and in
such a way as to bring together a representative body
of legal, and of
psychiatric, expertise, and of appropriate general community experience. The
relevant legislation entails, put simply,
that the accused will not be released
back into the general community without the Tribunal's having first made a
positive finding,
based upon credible evidence, that she is no longer a danger
to any member of the community. Even if some such recommendation be
made in due
time, the accused will be released back into the community, again speaking
simply and in the context of the present particular
case, subject to
appropriate conditions which will be appropriately monitored.
<P>

24  	There is one remaining matter that calls for the attention of
the Court. It concerns Exhibit U, which is a four-page document
prepared for
the information of the Court by Miss Helen Burdis, the accused's sister and the
person named as the victim in the third
count in the indictment.
<P>

25  	The document is, essentially, what would be described these days
as a `victim impact statement'. The document opens, in part,
with this
statement:
<P>

"I understand that, in making this statement, there is little likelihood in
making any impact in the outcome of this trial, however
I feel strongly that
there be an opportunity for the family's voice to be heard."
<P>

26  	It is, of course, the case that such a statement cannot
influence, as a matter of law, the outcome of the trial of the accused.
It is,
however, my view that Miss Burdis is entitled to put her document forward for
the information of the Court; and is entitled,
more importantly, to have it
treated with a respectful seriousness by the Court. The detail of what the
document says is heart-rending.
For my own part, I cannot bring myself to say
the usual trite and conventional things, such as that I can well imagine the
anguish
and the sense of loss and the familial de-stabilisation of which the
document speaks. I think that the proper course is simply to
receive, and to
acknowledge, the contents of the document; to express sincere condolences to
Miss Burdis and the other members of
her immediate family; and to express the
sincere hope that time will, at least to some extent, assuage the grief that
the document
so graphically and so movingly expresses.
<P>

27  	I presume to say one further thing, which, ordinarily, I would
not say. It is this: that I express the hope that the media
will be properly
respectful of the grief and distress, and of the overwhelming sense of
frustration and incomprehension, that are
being experienced by the surviving
members of the Burdis family, not the least important of whom is a little girl
aged some 10 years;
and that the media will, in consideration of those matters,
report the present trial, if indeed it needs to be reported at all, with
a
decent restraint.
