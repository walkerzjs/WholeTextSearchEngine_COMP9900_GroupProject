<b>4117/98 - JOHN VOURIS - AS LIQUIDATOR OF CADIMA EXPRESS PTY LTD  v  DEPUTY
COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by notice of motion by Mr
Dickerson, the first cross-defendant to the first cross-claim
in the
proceedings, for orders for the appointment of a receiver to a cause of action
and for directions that the receiver commence
and prosecute certain
proceedings. Appropriately enough, the application was made on the basis of
limited evidence, notwithstanding
there are several relevant sets of
proceedings and a great volume of evidence in those proceedings overall.
<P>

2  	Although I appreciated the endeavours of counsel in limiting the
scope of the evidence for the purposes of the application,
after I heard the
matter on 23 and 24 August 1999 I decided that I should grant leave for further
evidence to be adduced, for reasons
which I gave ex tempore on 25 August 1999.
That further evidence having been supplied in the form of affidavits, I am now
in a position
to determine Mr Dickerson's application.  I have decided that the
application fails for the reasons which I now set out.
<P>

<b>Facts and findings</b>
<P>

3  	The present case arises out of the winding up of Cadima Express
Pty Limited (`Cadima') by order of this Court on 19 December
1996.  At the time
of the order Cadima had two shareholders, Mr and Mrs Dickerson, who were also
its directors.  It traded as a freight
forwarding and parcel delivery business,
employing about 140 employees and sub-contractors.
<P>

4  	Cadima was responsible for remitting Group tax in respect of its
employees and prescribed payments system (`PPS') tax deductions
in respect of
its sub-contractors to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (`Commissioner').
It fell into arrears and the Commissioner
issued a statutory demand for payment
on 18 April 1996.  At the time $579,412.12 was claimed as owing to the
Commissioner.  The Commissioner
commenced separate proceedings against Mr and
Mrs Dickerson in the District Court to recover penalties for Cadima's failure
to pay
group tax, and in this Court to recover penalties from them in relation
to Cadima's PPS tax.
<P>

5  	When payment was not made the Commissioner commenced the
proceedings for winding up which eventually led to the order of 19
December
1996, namely, proceedings 2830/96.   The affidavit in support of the winding up
summons in those proceedings, sworn by D
B Barclay on 8 July 1996, stated that
the amount due and owing by Cadima to the Commissioner for arrears of group tax
and PPS tax
was by that time $604,818.10.
<P>

6  	The hearing of the winding up summons was adjourned to 7 November
1996.  By a letter dated 1 November 1996 Cadima's accountant
provided an
analysis of the company's financial position directed towards assessing whether
the company could pay $50,000 per month
in reduction of its tax liability.  The
letter was forwarded to the Commissioner on 4 November 1996 with a covering
letter from Cadima's
solicitor, Mr Beilby, who claimed the accountant's letter
demonstrated his client's ability to make those payments.  By his letter
of 5
November 1996 Mr Beilby provided his own assessment of his client's ability to
pay, in terms similar to the accountant's letter.
<P>

7  	The Commissioner responded to Mr Beilby's letter of 5 November by
letter of 6 November 1996, in the following terms:
<P>

`Group &amp; PPS Tax:  CADIMA EXPRESS PTY LTD 
<P>

Further to your letter of 5 November 1996 and telephone conversation between
yourself and Derrick Barclay of this office today,
it is confirmed that this
office is prepared to accept your client's repayment proposal as follows:-
<P>

1)	Payment by bank cheque of $100,000.00 to be handed to Elizabeth Jones
(Australian Government Solicitor) before the hearing at
the Supreme Court on 7
November 1996.
<P>

2)	Payment by bank cheque of $50,000, to be received at this office by close of
business on or before the 7th of each following
month until the debt is
cleared.
<P>

3)	Current monthly Group and PPS tax to be paid on time, commencing with
October 1996 Group tax, due 7 November 1996.
<P>

4)	Details of May 1996 to September Group and PPS tax to be provided within 14
days of the date of this letter.  This debt to be
included in the repayment
arrangement.
<P>

5)	Payment will be made by bank cheque paid to the Australian Taxation Office
at P O Box 422, Parramatta 2123 or DX 28474 Parramatta.
<P>

Attention Derrick Barclay.
<P>

If the cheque for $100,000 is received as arranged, the AGS will seek a six
week adjournment at the hearing on 7 November 1996.
<P>

With reference to the District Court proceedings Nos 763 and 764, against Mr
and Mrs Dickerson, we will not seek summary judgment
on condition that the
terms for repayment are strictly complied with.  However, should there be
default on the arrangement we may
file a notice of motion for summary judgment
without further notice.'
<P>

8  	An affidavit of Mr Beilby filed in other proceedings (4534/96,
which I shall describe below) states he was instructed to appear
in Court on 19
December 1996, but that he was involved in a meeting in a different matter on
that day and overlooked the notation
of the hearing date in his diary.  A
winding up order was sought by the Commissioner at the hearing on 19 December
and in the absence
of any appearance for the company, the order was made and Mr
Vouris was appointed liquidator.  In his affidavit, Mr Beilby states
that his
office did not receive notice that the Commissioner intended to seek a winding
up order, notwithstanding that, from his
point of view, the matter had been
settled.  On the evidence before me, there was no basis for his expectation
that he would be given
notice that the Commissioner would seek the orders which
were the subject of the hearing, nor for his understanding that the matter
had
been settled.  The proposed Second Cross-claim asserts that Cadima and its
solicitors did not appear at the hearing of the winding-up
summons on 19
December 1996 in reliance on an assumption, created by the Commissioner's
conduct, to the effect that as long as Cadima
continued to perform its
obligations as set out in the letter of 6 November, the Commissioner would
adjourn the hearing.  But that
assertion is inconsistent with the explanation
in Mr Beilby's affidavit that he simply overlooked the notation of the hearing
date
in his diary.  
<P>

9  	Mr Barclay, the responsible taxation officer in the matter, swore
an affidavit in the winding up proceedings (2830/96) in which
he claimed that
by 19 December 1996 Cadima was in default of the arrangements set out in the
letter of 6 November 1996 in several
respects.  Mr Dickerson's evidence
(including his affidavits of 20 December 1996 and 1 May 1997 in proceedings
4534 of 1996) is inconsistent
with Mr Barclay's evidence in some respects, but
he deposes to facts which imply that Cadima did not comply with the terms of
the
6 November letter in certain ways.  In  my opinion it is clear beyond
contention that Cadima failed to comply fully with the arrangements
set out in
the letter of 6 November 1996, but I shall defer further discussion of the
matter until I have completed my narrative
of the facts and a statement of the
applicable law.
<P>

10  	Mr Barclay gave instructions that the application for a winding
up order should proceed on 19 December 1996 in view of what
appeared to him to
be clear breaches of the arrangements, and the order was made on that day.
When Mr Beilby discovered that a winding
up order had been made, he quickly
prepared an application for a stay of the order.  On 20 December 1996 new
proceedings (4534/96)
were commenced in this Court, separate from the winding
up proceedings, in which Mr Dickerson as plaintiff sought to set aside the
winding up order or to terminate the winding up. By notice of motion in the new
proceedings heard on 24 December 1996, Mr Dickerson
sought to stay the winding
up. Mr Dickerson also filed a notice of motion in the winding up proceedings
(2830/96), seeking a stay
of the winding up order.
<P>

11  	An application was made to Bennett A-J on 20 December 1996 for
abridgment of service of the summons and notices of motion.
Her Honour required
Mr Dickerson, as a condition of the leave which she granted, to undertake to
replace four cheques which he claimed
to have sent for payment of October and
November Group and PPS tax, but which the Commissioner claimed not to have
received, with
fresh cheques.  On 24 December 1996 orders where made by
consent, including an order that the winding up be stayed until 10 February
1997.
<P>

12  	On 15 January 1997 the Commissioner's office wrote to Mr Beilby
saying that if current monthly Group and PPS taxes were paid
on time and a bank
cheque for $50,000 was delivered to his office by hand on or before 7th of each
month until the debt was cleared,
the Commissioner would not oppose an
application to have the orders winding up the company and appointing the
liquidator set aside
on 10 February 1997, but if the arrangement was not
adhered to an application would be made to have the matter restored on three
days' notice.  The same view was expressed (though without reference to
restoring the matter on three days' notice) in a letter from
the Commissioner's
solicitor to Mr Beilby dated 28 January 1997.
<P>

13  	On 10 February 1997 the stay application was adjourned to 24
March 1997.  On 20 March 1997 St George Partnership Banking Ltd,
Cadima's
banker, appointed receivers and managers of the company's assets and
undertaking in order to enforce and protect its security.
 At a further hearing
on 24 March 1997 Mr Dickerson sought an adjournment for six weeks and a
continuation of the stay during that
period to enable him to negotiate with the
receivers.  The adjournment was granted, notwithstanding the opposition of the
liquidator
and some creditors, although the Commissioner (consistently with his
letter of 15 January 1997) neither consented to nor opposed
the application for
an adjournment.
<P>

14  	When the stay application returned to Court on 12 May 1997, Mr
Dickerson sought a further extension of the stay for six weeks
with the support
of the receivers, who took the view that they would be likely to obtain a
higher price for assets of the company
which they proposed to sell if a
liquidator was not in place.  At the hearing Mr Dickerson's counsel notified
the Court of his client's
intention to bring a representative application on
behalf of Cadima seeking damages from the Commissioner for breach of contract,
the contract being the arrangement evidenced by the Commissioner's letter of 6
November 1996.  Simos J directed that any such action
be defined by pleadings.
Mr Dickerson did not apply to make such a cross-claim in either of the two
proceedings which were then on
foot.  Simos J granted an adjournment and
extension of the stay to 30 June 1997, and on the latter date, he granted a
further adjournment
to 7 July 1997.
<P>

15  	On 7 July 1997, by consent of the all parties in both
proceedings, Santow J dismissed the summons in proceedings 4534/96 and
the
notice of motion for a stay of the winding up orders in proceedings 2830/96,
and dissolved the existing stay of the winding up
order.  Subsequently, on that
day, but not before (except fleetingly on 19/20 December 1996), Mr Vouris was
able to take up fully
his role as liquidator of Cadima.
<P>

16  	As liquidator of Cadima, Mr Vouris produced a `Report as to
Solvency' dated 31 October 1997.  The Report stated that he wished
to commence
proceedings against the Commissioner for the recovery of payments which he
alleged to be unfair preferences under s 588FA
or void dispositions under s 468
of the Corporations Law.  The Report also noted that the liquidator had
available to him an action
against the directors under s 588FH, since Cadima's
payment to the Commissioner relieved the directors of personal liability to
pay.
 The Report pointed out that under s 588FA the action was predicated on
the company being insolvent at the time when the payments
were made to the
Commissioner.  Consequently, the report proceeded to review evidence which led
the liquidator to conclude that the
company was insolvent at all relevant
times.
<P>

<b>The proceedings for recovery of preferences, and the Cross-claims</b>
<P>

17  	By a Statement of Claim filed on 1 October 1998 in proceedings
4117/98, the liquidator caused Cadima to sue the Commissioner
to recover
payments made to him by Cadima for Group and PPS tax totalling $699,424.57 as
unfair preferences or voidable dispositions.
<P>

18  	On 24 November 1998 the Commissioner filed a cross-claim (the
First Cross-claim) against Mr and Mrs Dickerson and Mr Vouris
as liquidator.
The cross-claim against Mr and Mrs Dickerson asserted their statutory liability
under s 588FGA(2) and (4) of the Corporations
Law to indemnify the
Commissioner, as directors of Cadima, in respect of any loss to the
Commissioner which would flow from an order
under s 588FF requiring the
Commissioner to disgorge unfair preferences paid to him by Cadima.  Against the
liquidator the First
Cross-claim sought a declaration that the payments made
after the commencement of the winding up were not void under s 468.
<P>

19  	On 28 June 1999 consent orders and declarations were made by
Santow J effectively disposing of the Statement of Claim in proceedings
4117/98.  The orders had the effect that the liquidator became entitled to
recover a total amount of  $560,000 from the Commissioner.
 Santow J's orders
imply that the Court had granted leave under s 477(2A) to Mr Vouris as
liquidator to compromise his claim against
the Commissioner.  The orders
effectively brought an end to the First Cross-claim as against the liquidator.
By the same token, Santow
J's order under s 588FF for recovery of unfair
preferences supplied one of the ingredients of the liability of directors under
s
588FGA(2) and (4), and to that extent the First Cross-claim against Mr and
Mrs Dickerson was strengthened by the consent orders.
<P>

20  	I referred earlier to Mr Dickerson's intention to bring a
representative action on behalf of Cadima against the Commissioner
for breach
of contract.  While not pursuing the claim in proceedings 2830/96 or 4534/96,
or by commencing separate proceedings, Mr
Dickerson now wishes to do so by
causing a Second Cross-claim to be initiated on behalf of Cadima in proceedings
No. 4117/98. Combining
the First and Second Cross-claims in the same
proceedings may have important practical advantages for Mr Dickerson, and
probably
also for Mrs Dickerson, especially if the Second Cross-claim is heard
and determined before the First.  If Cadima were successful
in the Second
Cross-claim the Commissioner would be liable to pay it damages for the indirect
benefit of Mr and Mrs Dickerson as
contributories, assuming there were no other
creditors.  That would produce a kind of offsetting, in a practical sense,
against the
Commissioner's claim made against Mr and Mrs Dickerson personally.
It appears that the liquidator has declined to bring the proposed
proceedings
on behalf of Cadima.  I shall return to the liquidator's position.
<P>

21  	By notice of motion filed in proceedings 4117/98 on 28 May 1999,
Mr Dickerson sought orders that he be appointed receiver without
security of
any rights of action arising out of the events which I have outlined, with
power to pursue a cause of action on behalf
of the company in the form of the
Second Cross-claim, which was annexed in draft to the notice of motion.  In
support of the application
Mr Dickerson offered personal undertakings and
security intended to protect the company and the Commissioner with respect to
costs.
<P>

22  	Subsequently, Mr Dickerson's counsel foreshadowed an amended
notice of motion seeking the appointment of an official liquidator
of this
Court as receiver rather than the appointment of Mr Dickerson himself, but
otherwise seeking orders in similar terms.  The
foreshadowed amendments to the
notice of motion have included amendments to the draft Second Cross-claim which
is annexed to it.
<P>

23  	Those amendments were refined up to a hearing of the application
which took place on 24 August 1999.  At that time counsel
for the applicant
handed up what was said to be the final form of the annexures to the proposed
amended notice of motion (namely,
Mr Dickerson's undertakings and the draft
Second Cross-claim) as well as short minutes of the orders which his client
seeks in the
application.  Since these documents replaced earlier drafts I
initialled and dated them for the purposes of identification.
<P>

24  	At the further hearing of the matter on 25 August 1999 I granted
leave to Mr Dickerson, as applicant, to file an amended notice
of motion to
reflect the initialled documents. The amended notice of motion was subsequently
filed on<b> </b>3 September 1999.  But that was not the end of the amendments
to the notice of motion and the Second Cross-claim.
<P>

25  	As I have mentioned, at the hearing on 25 August 1999 I conveyed
to the parties my concern about some inadequacies of evidence,
delivering some
brief oral reasons to clarify the basis of my concern.  I said the evidence
appeared to me to be unclear with respect
to whether the applicant could
establish an arguable case for his view that Cadima Express did not repudiate
its agreement with the
Commissioner prior to 19 December 1996.  I also said
that there was insufficient direct evidence of the liquidator's attitude to
the
proceedings proposed by the applicant.  I directed that affidavit evidence on
these matters be filed and served.  
<P>

26  	The applicant and the liquidator have subsequently filed and
served additional evidence, which I have taken into account in
preparing these
reasons for judgment.  The applicant has also sought and been granted leave to
file an amended notice of motion which
annexes yet another version of the
proposed Second Cross-claim, asserting that if Cadima breached its agreement
with the Commissioner,
the Commissioner nevertheless affirmed the agreement.

<P>

27  	The Commissioner submits that the making of the winding up order
has created an estoppel by judgment which prevents the company
from agitating
the question whether the order should have been made (citing <i>Blair v Curran
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2062%20CLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939)<i> </i>62 CLR 464</a>, 531 and <i>Brewer v Brewer </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1953/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1953] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%29%2088%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953) 88 CLR 1</a>,
15-16.)  The draft Second Cross-claim pleads that because of an agreement to
compromise the terms of payment of the debt, no money
was owing at the time
when the order was made, and yet in making the order the Court must have been
satisfied that the plaintiff
was a creditor.  In view of my conclusion that
there is no arguable case to support the proposed proceedings, it is
unnecessary for
me to make a final decision on this point.  However, it seems
to me that the making of an order against the defendant in proceedings,
upon
the application of the plaintiff, does not necessarily estop the defendant from
later arguing that the plaintiff's application
for the order constitutes a
breach of contract for which the plaintiff is liable in damages, especially in
a case where the defendant
was not present when the order was made.  The
proposed Second Cross-claim relies on the making of the order, and presumably
its validity,
as an ingredient in the loss for which compensation is sought.
It does not seek to upset the Court's adjudication that the grounds
for the
making of the order were present;  rather, it asserts that the plaintiff in the
proceedings broke his promise not to seek
the order and failed to place before
the Court the facts relating to the compromise agreement and in so doing, the
plaintiff caused
loss and damage to the defendant.  In my view, the winding up
order would not estop the company from asserting that cause of action.
 
<P>

28  	Nor does the dismissal of the proceedings to set aside or
terminate the winding-up give rise to an estoppel of the kind referred
to in
<i>The Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589.</a>  Even a
fully reasoned decision to dismiss proceedings for the termination or setting
aside of the winding up order, made some months
after the date of the winding
up order, would not necessarily create an estoppel of a kind which would
prevent the company from subsequently
making assertions about the facts which
were in existence at the time when the winding up order was made.  This is
because the decision
on the application to terminate or set aside the winding
up order would be made having regard to the facts presented to the Court
at the
time of its decision;  in particular, evidence with respect to the insolvency
of the company at that time, rather than at
the time of the making of the
winding up order:  see, for example, <i>George Ward Steel Pty Ltd v Kizkot Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2015%20ACLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 15 ACLR 464.</a>
<P>

29  	The Commissioner asserts that the present application is made by
Mr Dickerson for a collateral purpose, namely to try to defeat
the
Commissioner's Cross-claim against Mr Dickerson.  That submission is consistent
with the facts before the Court, but it is unnecessary
for me to express a view
on it.
<P>

<b>The liquidator's attitude to the Second Cross-claim</b>
<P>

30  	Mr Dickerson's evidence is that he had several conversations
with the liquidator in which he asked whether the liquidator intended
to take
any action against the Commissioner for `wrongly winding up Cadima'.  He says
that the liquidator agreed to consider the
matter and call him when a decision
had been made, but the liquidator never rang back.
<P>

31  	I think it unlikely that any such conversation took place.  I
accept the liquidator's evidence that he cannot recall any such
conversations,
and that he would have had some recollection of the conversations had they
occurred.  Further, Mr Dickerson, though
a member of Cadima's Committee of
Inspection, did not any stage request the liquidator to convene a meeting of
the Committee so that
the issue of the cause of action now contemplated by him
could be considered by the Committee.
<P>

32  	However, it is not necessary for me to reach a final conclusion
as to whether the conversation took place.  The important matter
for me is not
whether the liquidator was asked some time ago to consider taking proceedings
and failed to give a proper response
at that time;  but whether the liquidator
gave the matter proper consideration before the close of evidence at the
hearing of the
present application.
<P>

33  	The evidence of the liquidator's attitude to the proposed
proceedings is contained in his affidavit of 15 September 1999. 
He refers to
his Report as to Solvency dated 31 October 1997, and his Reports to Creditors
for the meetings of 22 May 1998 and 11
May 1999.  He says he formed the view
that Cadima was plainly insolvent at the time it was wound up, and that it had
been insolvent
for some time prior to that date.  He has not subsequently
altered his view.  The proceedings which he instituted against the Commissioner
with respect to voidable transactions were based on his view that there was
compelling evidence of insolvency.  Those proceedings
were prosecuted and
settled on that basis.  That being so, his view is that to institute against
the Commissioner the proceedings
contemplated in the proposed Second
Cross-claim would place him in a position of `conflict of interest', because
the Second Cross-claim
is based on the assertion that Cadima was solvent.  
<P>

34  	In my opinion the receiver's view that<b> </b>bringing the
Second Cross-claim would put him in a position of conflict of interest is
misguided, for two reasons.  First, the assertion
of the Second Cross-claim
does not require the liquidator to embrace the proposition that Cadima was
solvent at the time when the
winding-up order was made.  It is true that
paragraph 44 of the Second Cross-claim (part of the amended notice of motion
filed on
6 October 1999) asserts Cadima's solvency.  But paragraph 45 asserts
in the alternative that Cadima's solvency `is of no consequence'
to the alleged
liability of the Commissioner under the Second Cross-claim, since the main
issue is whether the Commissioner committed
a breach of contract, regardless of
whether the other contracting party was insolvent.  
<P>

35  	Secondly, the `conflict of interest' to which the liquidator
refers is a false one, in my view.  His point seems to be that
having espoused
the view in his report that Cadima was insolvent, he has an interest in
maintaining that view which would be in conflict
with his duty to establish
Cadima's solvency in order to succeed in the proposed proceedings (assuming,
for this purpose, that Cadima's
solvency is an essential ingredient of the
Second Cross-claim).  If there were a conflict of interest of this kind, it
would not
be solved by the liquidator declining to bring the proposed
proceedings, for that course of action would place the liquidator's interest
in
maintaining consistency above his duty to take proceedings in order to recover
assets for the company.  If there were such a conflict
of interest, it might be
necessary for the liquidator to resign.  But in my view there is no more a
conflict between interest and
duty in these circumstances than there would be a
conflict between the liquidator's duty to attend to his work during business
hours,
and his interest in staying in bed.  The performance of a duty may be
irksome because one is busy, or tired, or because the performance
of the duty
involves admitting that one has previously made a mistake.  But matters of
those kinds do not give rise to conflicts
between interest and duty.  I am not
persuaded that the liquidator has any sufficient interest in adhering to an
incorrect position
(if it be incorrect) that there can be said to be a conflict
between that interest and his duty as liquidator.  
<P>

36  	Fortunately the liquidator's affidavit puts forward some other
grounds for his view that he should not bring the proposed proceedings.
 He
says that on the basis of investigations conducted by him and on his behalf,
his opinion is that the proceeds of the voidable
transactions claims
represented the only asset of Cadima that he could possibly recover as
liquidator.  The liquidator does not want
to jeopardise that asset by
commencing the kind of action Mr Dickerson contemplates, and he takes into
account his view of the prospects
of success of the action.  He expresses the
opinion that Mr Dickerson wishes to pursue the proposed proceedings
principally, if not
entirely, because he sees them as the only possible defence
available to him against to the Commissioner's claim against him personally.

<P>

37  	In my opinion it is appropriate to infer from this evidence that
the liquidator has given due and proper consideration to the
merits of the
proposed proceedings and has decided that their merits are not sufficient to
justify putting the company's assets at
risk by taking proceedings, even though
he has taken a misguided view about conflicts of interest.
<P>

<b>The law</b>
<P>

38  	The application is for the appointment of a receiver to pursue a
cause of action on behalf of another.  This Court's jurisdiction
to appoint a
receiver is ample enough to permit such an order to be made.  The effect of the
orders sought would be to give the receiver
control over the chose in action to
be pursued in the proceedings, which is a species of property, and to empower
and direct the
receiver to seek to realise that property by litigation for the
benefit of the entity on whose behalf it is realised.
<P>

39  	Difficulty arises because in the present case the entity whose
chose in action is to be asserted is in liquidation. The function
of the Court
with respect to a company in liquidation was considered by McLelland J in<b>
</b><i>Aliprandi v Griffith Vintners Pty Ltd</i> (in liq) (1991) 6 ACSR 250,
252.  His Honour set out the description adopted by the Privy Council in
<i>Lloyd-Owen v Bull</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%204%20DLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 4 DLR 273</a>, 276:
<P>

`A judge in winding up is the custodian of the interests of every class
affected by the liquidation.  It is his duty ... to see
that all assets of the
company are brought into the winding up.  In authorising proceedings,
especially if they may or will involve
some drain on the assets, he must
satisfy himself as to their probable success; where ... they involve no
possible charge on assets,
he will nevertheless be careful to see that any
necessary action taken in the company's name under his authority is not
vexatious
or merely oppressive.'
<P>

40  	For present purposes it is worth emphasising that the Court's
concerns include protection of the assets of the company in liquidation
for the
benefit of the creditors, and prevention of oppressive or vexatious litigation
in the company's name.  This necessitates
at least a limited investigation of
the merits of the proposed litigation.
<P>

41  	The Corporations Law gives the Court statutory jurisdiction to
supervise the conduct of a liquidator with respect to litigation
proposed in
the name of or on behalf of the company.  Section 477(6) states that the
exercise by the liquidator of his or her powers
is subject to the control of
the Court, and any creditor or contributory or the Commission may apply to the
Court with respect to
any exercise or proposed exercise of any of those powers.
(See also s 511 with respect to voluntary liquidation, and s 1321 with
respect
to appeals to the Court from decisions by a liquidator.)  Where the liquidator
is invited to commence proceedings to assert
rights of the company and declines
to do so, the normal course is for an aggrieved creditor or contributory to
make an application
to the Court under these provisions.  The importance of the
statutory provisions is emphasised in the judgment of Cole J in<b>
</b><i>Partnership Pacific Pty Limited v Aliprandi</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ACSR%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ACSR 51.</a>
<P>

42  	However, in addition to its statutory powers, the Court
possesses an inherent power in the course of the winding up of a company
to
permit proceedings to be taken in the company's name at the instigation of a
creditor or contributory, including a prospective
creditor:  <i>Russell v
Westpac Banking Corporation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1994/4479.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] SASC 4479</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13 ACSR 5.</a>  In<b> </b><i>Aliprandi</i>
McLelland J (at 252) confirms that the Court has a power `of respectable
antiquity and ... sanctioned by high authority' to authorise
a procedure based
on `the same principle on which a man could always have filed a bill in the old
Court of Chancery against his trustee
to be allowed to use his name to recover
the trust property' (citing<b> </b><i>Cape Bretton Co v Fenn</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281881%29%2017%20Ch%20D%20198" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1881) 17 Ch D
198</a>, 207).
<P>

43  	Given that there is a power wide enough for the Court to
authorise that proceedings be commenced in the name of the company
in
liquidation by a person other than the liquidator, upon what basis will that
jurisdiction be exercised?  
<P>

44  	Counsel for the applicant in the present case submitted that it
was inappropriate for the Court to look at evidence going to
the merits of the
proposed litigation but instead, the Court should make its decision solely on
the basis of the draft pleading.
 That would mean that if the pleading,
considered in isolation, appeared to identify an appropriate cause of action,
the Court would
allow the proceedings to be commenced and prosecuted regardless
of whether there was any evidence to support the allegations made
in the
pleading.  That cannot be correct.
<P>

45  	The better view is that the Court should consider whether the
cause of action asserted in the pleading, together with such
evidence as is
relied on in the application, demonstrates an arguable case for the relief
which the proposed litigation would seek.
 Thus in<b> </b><i>Aliprandi</i>,
McLelland J (at 253) inquired as to whether there was an arguable case in
support of the claims which the applicant wished to make,
concluding that there
was no arguable case except in one instance.  He made his inquiry by reference
to the material which was placed
before the Court by the parties to the
application, not by reference to a draft pleading.  In <i>Magarditch v
Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd </i>(1999) 32 ACSR 367, 377,
383-4, the full Federal Court approved McLelland J's formulation and also
referred to <i>Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2041%20FCR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 41 FCR 550</a>, 556-7
where it was said that an applicant for leave to proceed against a company in
liquidation was required to satisfy the court
that the claim had a solid
foundation and would give rise to a serious dispute, although it was not
necessary for the applicant to
establish a prima facie case in the accepted
sense.  Although the test formulated in <i>Vagrand</i> is not quite the same as
McLelland J's test in <i>Aliprandi,</i> the full Federal Court's view was that
in practice it may be that there is very little to distinguish the two
approaches.  I respectfully
agree.
<P>

46  	A particularly relevant matter for the Court is the liquidator's
attitude. In <i>Scarel Pty Limited v City Loan &amp; Credit Corporation Pty
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2012%20ACLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 12 ACLR 30</a> Gummow J at 733 held that the ordinary rule is
that the liquidator is the appropriate person to decide whether the company
should
commence proceedings, subject to review under the statutory provisions.
He considered the authorities on this point and compared
them with more general
case law on exceptions to the rule in<b> </b><i>Foss v Harbottle</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/478.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 478</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%202%20Hare%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 2
Hare 461</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=67%20ER%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">67 ER 189.</a>  He said that when a company goes into liquidation, it is
not appropriate to speak of exceptions to the rule in<b> </b><i>Foss v
Harbottle</i> which would take the carriage of the claim outside the winding
up<b> </b>
<P>

47  	In <i>Partnership Pacific Ltd v Aliprandi</i> Cole J (at 54)
said that for the application to succeed, more must be shown than that the
liquidator's position is protected by an
indemnity.  In particular, if the
liquidator is of the view that the proposed litigation is soundly based, but he
cannot pursue it
because of absence of funds, a Court will be more disposed to
permit proceedings by a contributory in the company's name than if
the
liquidator has decided that there is no reasonable foundation for the claim.

<P>

48  	These two cases indicate that the Court is entitled to have the
assistance of the liquidator in making its assessment as to
whether an arguable
case has been demonstrated, and that the Court will normally give weight to the
liquidator's view.
<P>

49  	In addition to inquiring whether there is an arguable case or
solid foundation for the proceedings, the Court needs to be satisfied
that
practical considerations support the initiation of the proceedings.  The cases
to which I have referred indicate that typically
the applicant offers to
indemnify the company in liquidation and the liquidator in respect of the
proceedings, and to conduct the
proceedings in such a fashion that liability to
pay costs is undertaken by the applicant rather than the company to the extent
that
it is possible to do so.  The Court will wish to be satisfied that the
assets of the company in liquidation are not put at risk by
the proceedings and
that the liquidator is not exposed to personal liability without proper
protection, and may also properly have
regard to the risks which the litigation
poses for the other party, given that the plaintiff is a company in
liquidation, the assets
of which are to be protected.  To these ends, the Court
may require that the person who conducts the litigation gives an indemnity
supported by security for the benefit of the company and the liquidator, and
perhaps also security for costs to protect the other
party to the litigation.
It may also be possible, as contended by counsel for the liquidator in the
present case, for the Court to
make an order permitting the liquidator to be
excused from the proposed proceedings, in order to protect the liquidator from
personal
liability with respect to the proposed proceedings.  But I doubt
whether it would be appropriate to require the proposed receiver
to provide a
personal indemnity to the liquidator or the company in circumstances such as
the present, notwithstanding Brownie J's
observations in somewhat different
circumstances in <i>Kelaw Pty Ltd v Catco Developments Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2015%20NSWLR%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 15
NSWLR 587</a>, 593.
<P>

50  	The liquidator may derive some comfort from the observations of
McLelland J in<b> </b><i>Aliprandi</i> (at 253) to the effect that with a
possible exception where the liquidator has been guilty of misconduct, there is
no legitimate
basis on which a costs order could be made against the liquidator
personally in proceedings between the company and a third party
to which the
liquidator is not a party;  and that there is no principle which would justify
the making of an order for costs against
a liquidator who is not a party where
the use of the company's name in the relevant proceedings by some other person
was authorised
by the Court.
<P>

51  	Those being the principles which govern an application to the
Court for orders permitting a person, other than the company
in liquidation or
the liquidator, to commence proceedings in the company's name, are there any
further or other principles which
apply when the application is for the
appointment of a receiver to pursue the litigation?  This question was
addressed by McLelland
J in the series of cases, <i>Pollnow v Garden Mews-St
Leonards Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%209%20ACLR%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 9 ACLR 82</a>;<b> </b><i>Garden Mews-St Leonards

<P>

52  	In<b> </b>the <i>Butler Pollnow</i> cases, McLelland J decided
to make an order for the appointment of a receiver to conduct litigation on
behalf of a company in provisional
liquidation. He noted that such a course of
action may be appropriate where the provisional liquidator is unwilling to sue
and lacks
assets to do so.  In the circumstances of that case Mr Pollnow would
have set up, by way of defence in the winding up proceedings
to which he was a
party, the substance of the matters which he wished the company to assert in
the other proceedings to which he
wished to join the company as a plaintiff.
His Honour said (at 95):
<P>

`If those matters are to be litigated in proceedings to be brought in the name
of the company, it seems to me, as at present advised,
likely that those
proceedings and the winding up proceedings (or at least the common issues in
them) would be heard together.  The
provisional liquidator cannot have the
carriage for the company of any defence to the winding up proceedings ... and
it would, therefore,
be inappropriate for him to have the carriage for the
company of proceedings raising similar issues which are heard together with
the
winding up proceedings.'
<P>

53  	His Honour judged it to be appropriate to appoint Mr Pollnow as
receiver of the company's chose in action so that it could
be pursued.  He said
(at 95): 
<P>

`the court should not allow its processes to be used in a way which would erect
procedural barriers or obstacles to the prosecution
of these claims on behalf
of the company, and the appointment of a receiver of the relevant causes of
action (perhaps more accurately
rights of action) with power to enforce the
same in the name of the company is an appropriate means of avoiding procedural
injustice.'
<P>

54  	He noted that Mr Pollnow offered to assume liability for all
legal costs incurred by the company in relation to the proposed
proceedings and
would give appropriate undertakings regarding his personal liability.  In
subsequent proceedings  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20ACLR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(9 ACLR 117)</a> McLelland J decided that Mr Pollnow's
appointment as receiver should be terminated, on the ground that he was not
qualified to act
as receiver having regard to s 323 of the Companies Code (now
s 418 of the Corporations Law), but in reaching this conclusion he
did not cast
any doubt on the principle as to appointment of a receiver which he had
enunciated at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20ACLR%2095" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">9 ACLR 95.</a>
<P>

55  	In<b> </b><i>Christianos v Aloridge</i> the full Federal Court
applied the principles enunciated by McLelland J in <i>Butler Pollnow</i>, but
concluded that the circumstances of the case before the Court did not justify
the appointment of a receiver.  This was because
the company in provisional
liquidation was the subject of an unopposed application for winding up and in
the circumstances it was
appropriate to leave the decision to pursue the claims
to the liquidator, once appointed.
<P>

56  	These cases demonstrate that the Court has the power to appoint
a receiver in cases where it decides to permit proceedings
to be commenced and
prosecuted in the name of a company in liquidation by a person other than the
liquidator.  Although the appointment
of a receiver should not be lightly
ordered, the principles by reference to which the order may be made are partly
the same as for
an order that a creditor or contributory be authorised to take
proceedings in the company's name. First, the Court must be satisfied
that
there is an arguable case or solid foundation to support the relief which the
proposed proceedings seek and, secondly, the Court
must be satisfied of the
practical considerations to which I have referred, relating to protection of
the assets of a company in
liquidation, the liquidator's personal position and
the position of the other party to the proposed proceedings.
<P>

57  	The cases with respect to receivership demonstrate that an
additional consideration is whether, if the liquidator cannot or
will not take
proceedings, the appointment of a receiver is a mechanism to be preferred to
other alternatives which may be available
in the circumstances.  They suggest
that the appointment of a receiver is most likely to be appropriate where the
liquidator is prevented
from doing so, by some good reason such as the one
explained by McLelland J in <i>Butler Pollnow</i>.
<P>

58  	The Commissioner submits that no case has been decided in which
a receiver has been appointed to a cause of action which concerns
the
liquidation itself.  That may be so, but in this case the proposed cause of
action does not challenge the validity of the winding-up
order;  instead it
seeks damages in respect of the Commissioner's conduct in applying for the
order and failing to disclose the compromise
agreement to the Court.  I see no
reason in principle why such a cause of action could not be maintained by a
receiver in a proper
case.  
<P>

<b>The present case</b>
<P>

59  	The first question to consider is whether there is an arguable
case or solid foundation for the company to obtain the relief
which would be
sought in the proposed proceedings.  In my opinion, the applicant has not
established that there is any arguable case
or solid foundation to support the
causes of action pleaded in the proposed Second Cross-claim.  
<P>

60  	The applicant says that Mr Beilby's letter of 5 November 1996
was an offer to compromise the terms of payment of the debt claimed
by the
Commissioner.  In its terms that letter merely gives Mr Beilby's assessment of
Cadima's ability to pay the debt by instalments
of $50,000 per month.  However,
in my opinion the letter either communicated or confirmed an implied offer to
compromise the terms
of payment by instalments of $50,000 per month.
<P>

61  	That implied offer was not accepted, but instead, the
Commissioner's letter of 6 November 1996 makes a counter-offer, since
it sets
out terms which were not part of Cadima's implied offer.  Cadima accepted the
counter-offer by its conduct in providing a
bank cheque for $100,000 in favour
of the Commissioner.  Assuming for present purposes that valuable consideration
was supplied,
there was therefore a contract between the parties with respect
to payment of the debt, the terms of which were recorded in the Commissioner's
letter of 6 November 1996.  The Commissioner's express obligations under his
letter were that:
<P>

&#183;	if the bank cheque for $100,000 was received as arranged, he would seek
a six week adjournment at the hearing of 7 November
1996;  and
<P>

&#183;	if the terms for repayment were strictly complied with, he would not
seek summary judgment against Mr and Mrs Dickerson in
the District Court
proceedings, reserving the right to file a notice of motion for summary
judgment without further notice should
there be default in the arrangements.
<P>

62  	The applicant says that the Commissioner agreed to compromise
the terms of payment of Cadima's debt.  In my view that submission
overstates
the effect of the 6 November letter.  I accept that an implied term of the
agreement was that the Commissioner would not
seek to recover the full amount
of the debt or to proceed with the winding up of Cadima during the six week
period beginning on 7
November 1996.  But the terms of the letter left the
Commissioner free to take proceedings for recovery or to wind the company up
after the expiration of the six week period, and I see no basis for implying a
term which would limit the Commissioner over a longer
period.  However, whether
the Commissioner's obligation not to proceed with recovery or winding up was
for a six week period or for
indefinite period, it was clearly a highly
conditional commitment on his part.  The letter of 6 November set out five
matters which
it described as `your client's repayment proposal', and stated
that the Commissioner would not seek summary judgment `on condition
that the
terms for repayment are strictly complied with'.  While that sentence appears
in the paragraph dealing with the District
Court proceedings, in my opinion the
proper construction of the letter as a whole is that strict compliance by
Cadima with the terms
set out in the letter was intended to be of the essence,
so that the Commissioner would be free of the obligation not to take further
steps towards recovery or winding up as soon as Cadima failed to comply
strictly with any of the terms.  That intention is clearly
implied from the
letter and Cadima must have understood it when it accepted the Commissioner's
offer by making payment of the $100,000.
<P>

63  	The affidavit evidence referred to in paragraph 9 of these
reasons for judgment shows that Cadima did not strictly comply with
the terms
of the letter of 6 November 1996. The first breach alleged by Mr Barclay is
that the payment of $50,000 due on or before
7 December 1996 was made at the
cashier's desk rather than being sent directly to him and marked to his
attention as required by
the terms of the arrangement;  and further, the amount
was paid without any direction being made by the company as to which debt
it
was to be appropriated against, and no file number was quoted at the time of
payment.  Consequently, he says, the amount was allocated
towards payment of
the company's income tax account rather than against the Group or PPS accounts.
Further, though Mr Barclay does
not complain of this, payment was due on 7
December but was made on 9 December 1996.  Mr Barclay's evidence is consistent
with the
payment receipt which is part of Exhibit J in the present application,
except that the receipt contains a reference to a file number.
 Except in that
respect, his account is not contradicted by any of Mr Dickerson's affidavit
evidence.  The evidence is consistent
only with a finding that payment was not
made by 7 December as required, and when it was made on 9 December it was not
made in the
manner required by paragraph 5 of the letter of 6 November.  There
was therefore a breach of the requirements of the letter of 6
November in that
respect.
<P>

64  	Secondly, Mr Barclay says that the payments for October and
November Group tax, due on 7 November and 7 December 1996 respectively,
and the
payments for October and November PPS tax, due respectively on 14 November and
14 December 1996, were not paid on time. 
In his affidavit of 20 December 1996
Mr Dickerson says that he forwarded the October payments to Mr Barclay under
cover of a letter
dated 7 November 1996, a copy of which he annexes.  But the
annexed letter only supplies information about PPS and group tax and
does not
purport to enclose cheques.  Mr Dickerson's affidavit annexes remittance
advices which, he says, are the only evidence of
drawing cheques for payment of
the October taxes.  He says the remittance advices were generated by printing
from computer records.
 But Mr Barclay says that there are no records held by
the Australian Taxation Office which indicate that the cheques were in fact
received.  Paragraph 3 of the letter of 6 November 1996 requires that monthly
Group and PPS tax be paid on time, and paragraph 5
(which, in my view, applies
to paragraph 3) says that payment is to be made by bank cheque to the stated
address of the Australian
Taxation Office, marked to Mr Barclay's attention.
Mr Dickerson's evidence indicates that the payments were not by bank cheque.
Additionally,
there is no receipt or covering letter in evidence, nor any basis
for disbelieving Mr Barclay's assertion that the cheques were not
received.
The only available conclusion is that, whether or not the cheques were drawn by
Cadima, they were not received by the Commissioner
prior to 19 December
1996.
<P>

65  	Mr Dickerson's affidavit annexes remittance advices with respect
to the November Group and PPS tax, but no other evidence of
payment.  Mr
Barclay says that there are no records held by the Australian Taxation Office
which indicate that the cheques referred
to in the remittance advices were
received.  Again, the only available conclusion, on the evidence, is that
whether or not the cheques
were drawn, they were not received by the
Commissioner prior to 19 December 1996.  Further, it appears from Mr
Dickerson's evidence
that the cheques, if drawn, were not bank cheques, and
according to the remittance advices, the cheques were drawn on 17 December
1996, after the due date for payment.  Once again, therefore, the only
available conclusion is that the terms of the letter of 6
November were not
complied with as regards the November Group and PPS tax.  The evidence
indicates that payment was made only after
replacement cheques were drawn
pursuant to Bennett A-J's orders, to which I have referred.
<P>

66  	The applicant contends that the Commissioner accepted Cadima's
cheques for the October and November Group and PPS tax as constituting
performance by Cadima of paragraph 3 of the letter of 6 November.  Mr Barclay's
evidence, however, implies that the cheques were
not received by the
Commissioner.  In the draft Second Cross-claim the applicant asserts, in
support of his contention that the cheques
were accepted by the Commissioner,
that at the hearing before Bennett A-J on 20 December 1996 orders were made on
the basis that
the cheques had been misplaced within the Parramatta office of
the Commissioner.  But that assertion is not supported by the report
by Mr
Dickerson's counsel to his instructing solicitors on 20 December 1996, and it
appears to me highly unlikely that the Commissioner
would have acknowledged
receipt and misplacement of the cheques in light of Mr Barclay's affidavit
evidence of 12 May 1997.  In my
view the contention that the Commissioner
accepted cheques for the October and November payments prior to 19 December
1996 cannot
plausibly be maintained.  
<P>

67  	The replacement cheques were drawn on 23 December 1996, pursuant
to an undertaking given by Mr Dickerson to Bennett A-J, and
their receipt and
payment cannot be relied upon as an act of acceptance of performance or waiver
of a kind which would render the
Commissioner's conduct at an earlier point in
time, namely 19 December 1996, a breach of contract.
<P>

68  	Mr Barclay's affidavit asserts that as at 19 December 1996, the
company had not provided the details of Group and PPS tax liabilities
for the
months of May to September 1996 as required by paragraph 4 of the letter of 6
November 1996, but Mr Dickerson's affidavit
of 20 December 1996 annexes a copy
of a letter of 7 November 1996 which purports to supply such particulars.  On
the evidence before
me in the present application, I cannot conclude that a
breach of paragraph 4 of the letter of 6 September 1996 has been established
beyond challenge. 
<P>

69  	My conclusion is that on 19 December 1996 Cadima was in breach
of paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the letter of 6 November 1996, and
was therefore in
breach of its obligations under its contract with the Commissioner in respect
of matters which the contract treated
as essential.  It had, in my view,
repudiated the contract between it and the Commissioner by breach, and the
Commissioner was entitled
to repudiate the contract and regard himself as no
longer bound by it.  Therefore, even if (as a matter of construction, contrary
to my view), the Commissioner's obligation under the contract would have
prevented him from seeking a winding up order on 19 December
1996, Cadima's
repudiation freed him of any such obligation.
<P>

70  	As at 19 December 1996, the day upon which the Commissioner
applied for and obtained a winding up order, it must have appeared
to Mr
Barclay that Cadima had completely repudiated the agreement.  Further, there
was no appearance on Cadima's behalf at the hearing.
 In my opinion it was
clear beyond argument that in those circumstances, the Commissioner was
entitled to seek a winding up order
on 19 December 1996 without breach of the
agreement recorded in the letter of 6 November.
<P>

71  	The applicant's alternative submission is that if, contrary to
its contentions, Cadima is found to have repudiated the contract
by breach,
nevertheless the contract remained on foot because the Commissioner made an
unequivocal election to affirm it prior to
19 December 1996.  The
Commissioner's affirmation is said to have arisen in consequence of four
matters.  First, it is said that
the Commissioner did not assert any
repudiation by Cadima, or acceptance of repudiation by him, on or before 19
December 1996.  The
evidence suggests that the Commissioner did not immediately
rely on Cadima's breaches, but in my opinion that conduct (if it be
established)
would not support the alleged affirmation.  The Commissioner's
conduct is consistent with my construction of the contract, according
to which
he was under no continuing obligation not to seek Cadima's winding up at the
adjourned hearing date of the winding-up summons.
 Further, mere failure to
assert the termination of the contract on or before 19 December 1996 could not
in the circumstances constitute
affirmation, since the full facts with respect
to Cadima's payments did not emerge until after the hearing on that date.
<P>

72  	Secondly, the applicant says that the Commissioner's conduct in
seeking the adjournment of the winding-up summons on 7 November
1996 was an
affirmation of the contract notwithstanding non-receipt of the October Group
and PPS tax payments.  Since the PPS tax
payment was not due until 14 November
and the Group tax payment was due only on 7 November, the applicant's
contention cannot be
entertained.  
<P>

73  	Thirdly, the applicant says that the Commissioner did not assert
a breach of the contract at the hearing on 19 December 1996
or at any earlier
time.  In my opinion the submission that a person who has rights which flow
from a breach of contract must assert
the breach before exercising those rights
is unsustainable.  
<P>

74  	Fourthly, the applicant contends that the Commissioner affirmed
the contract by seeking replacement cheques at the hearing
before Bennett A-J.
But that hearing was on 20 December 1996, the day after the making of the
winding up order, and cannot be evidence
of an election to affirm prior to the
making of the winding-up order on 19 December 1996.
<P>

75  	The applicant also contends that between 20 December 1996 and 7
July 1997 the Commissioner affirmed the continued operation
of the agreement
set out in the letter of 6 November 1996 on several occasions.  As I have said,
the conduct of the Commissioner
after the termination of the contract, which
occurred no later than 19 December 1996, cannot constitute any election to
affirm it.
 Further, the conduct which the applicant relies upon shows only
that the Commissioner made various payment arrangements in exchange
for
agreeing not to oppose applications to set aside, terminate or stay the orders
of 19 December 1996.  Thus, in his letter to Mr
Beilby of 15 January 1997, the
Commissioner confirmed a repayment arrangement which he set out, and said that
if the arrangement
was adhered to his office would not oppose an application to
have the orders appointing the liquidator set aside at the hearing on
10
February 1997.  On 28 January 1997 the Commissioner's solicitor wrote to Mr
Beilby saying that if his client strictly complied
with the arrangement which
had been agreed to (presumably, the arrangement set out in the Commissioner's
letter of 15 January 1997),
the Commissioner would not oppose an application
that the winding up order be set aside.  On 24 March 1997 the Commissioner
appeared
at a hearing of the application to set aside the winding up order and
indicated that he would neither consent to nor oppose an application
for an
adjournment, with a stay of the winding up in the meantime.  The Commissioner
did not oppose subsequent adjournments of those
proceedings.  But the
Commissioner's conduct cannot be regarded as reviving or affirming the
arrangements of 6 November 1996, since
it was directed to a different issue,
namely the staying and termination of the winding-up order.
<P>

76  	Next, the applicant contends that by his conduct in adjourning
the winding up summons for six weeks at the hearing on 7 November
1996, the
Commissioner created an assumption on the part of Cadima and its solicitors, to
the effect that as long as Cadima continued
to perform its obligations under
the agreement set out in the letter of 6 November 1996, the Commissioner would
continue to seek
adjournments of the winding-up summons and would not seek to
have the summons heard and determined.  However, in my opinion the
Commissioner's
conduct in obtaining an adjournment at the hearing on 7 November
1996 was conduct in performance of his obligation under the contract
and
created no basis for any assumption beyond the terms of the contract.
Consequently the estoppel argument must fail.  Since Cadima's
conduct amounted
to repudiation of the contract set out in the letter of 6 November 1996, and
the Commissioner accepted the repudiation
and terminated the contract, the
applicant's contention that in applying to wind up Cadima on 19 December 1996
the Commissioner repudiated
the agreement must also fail.
<P>

77  	In summary, my opinion is that the applicant has not
demonstrated any plausible factual basis for the assertions contained
in the
draft Second Cross-claim, and I therefore conclude that there is no arguable
case or solid foundation for the relief which
the draft Second Cross-claim
seeks.  In my opinion, therefore, the application for appointment of a receiver
to commence and prosecute
such proceedings must be denied.
<P>

78  	If, contrary to my view, there had been an arguable case to
support the allegation of breach of contract, there would still
be a question
whether Cadima's loss or damage was caused by the Commissioner's conduct in
applying for the winding up order, or by
the applicant's own failure to have
the winding up terminated in light of the facts alleged in the proposed Second
Cross-claim.
<P>

79  	If, contrary to my view, there was an arguable case or solid
foundation to support the proposed proceedings, the question would
arise
whether it is appropriate in a procedural and practical sense that a receiver
be appointed in the present circumstances.  Given
my conclusion on the
`arguable case' issue, it is unnecessary for me to express a final view on this
point, but I doubt very much
that I would be satisfied that the case for the
appointment of a receiver had been made out, even if the proposed proceedings
had
identified an arguable case for relief.  Here the liquidator has considered
the matter and has decided not to risk the company's
assets by taking
proceedings.  Mr Dickerson has offered a detailed undertaking to be personally
liable for the cost of the proposed
proceedings to the exclusion of the
company, and that he will personally give security to the Commissioner for
costs by granting
an equitable charge over a property, to be secured by a
caveat.  But I am not convinced that these arrangements would protect the
company and the Commissioner completely, since they depend on the Court fixing
the amount of the security for costs and they assume
that the value of the
applicant's equity in the property will always exceed that amount, although
there is no undertaking not to
create prior ranking encumbrances over the
property.  I note that Mrs Dickerson, who is evidently a co-owner of the
property offered
as the subject of the equitable charge, has not offered to
give an undertaking to the Court.
<P>

80  	Even if the arrangements proposed by the applicant were adequate
to ensure that the company and the Commissioner were protected,
and there were
an arguable case to support the proceedings, it would not necessarily follow
that the application should succeed.
 The Court should not overrule the
liquidator's judgment unless a good reason for doing so is established.  In the
<i>Butler Pollnow</i> cases a winding up order had not been made and it was
likely that Mr Pollnow would have set up by way of defence in the winding up
proceedings the very matters which he wished the company to assert in the other
proceedings.  The provisional liquidator could not
conduct a defence to the
winding up proceedings, and ought not to assert the same matters in proceedings
brought on behalf of the
company, and therefore it was appropriate to appoint a
receiver to assert the company's cause of action.  In <i>Christianos v
Aloridge</i> the Court declined to appoint a receiver in order that the
decision to pursue the alleged course of action could be taken by the
liquidator, once appointed.  In the present case there is nothing comparable
with the special circumstances of the <i>Butler Pollnow</i> cases, and
<i>Christianos v Aloridge</i> shows that the Court should normally give weight
the liquidator's decision.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

81  	Mr Dickerson's application for orders for the appointment of a
receiver, and other orders, should be denied on the ground that
he has not
shown that there is an arguable case or solid foundation for the proposed
proceedings.  Even if he had done so, I would
be inclined not to make the
orders which he seeks in light of the attitude of the liquidator to the
proposed proceedings, and my
uncertainty as to whether the undertakings and
security which he offers would be adequate protection for the assets of the
company
and for the Commissioner, assuming that the liquidator's position could
be effectively protected.  
<P>

82  	I shall hear submissions as to costs, although my inclination is
to order that the applicant pay the costs of both respondents
to the notice of
motion.
