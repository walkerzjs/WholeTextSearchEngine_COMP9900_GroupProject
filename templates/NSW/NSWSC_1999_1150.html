<P>


<P>

<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	The present proceedings were commenced by statement of
claim filed on 19 May 1999.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff, St George Bank Limited (to which I will
refer, for convenience, as "the Bank") claims possession of certain
land of
which the defendants are jointly the registered proprietors.  The basis of the
claim is expressed to be default by the defendants
under the terms of the
mortgage to which the land was subject.  On 2 July 1999 the first defendant,
John Wilson, acting on his own
behalf, filed a defence to the statement of
claim.  On the same date Mr Wilson, purporting to act on behalf of the second
defendant,
his wife (Laraine Joy Wilson) filed a document under a cover sheet
entitled "Defence of Second Defendant".  Annexed to this document
was a
hand-written letter, apparently signed by the second defendant.  It will be
convenient hereafter to refer to the two defendants
by their names.
<P>

3   	By notice of motion the Bank seeks orders that each defence
be struck out and that summary judgment be entered on the statement
of claim.
SCR Pt 15 r 26 was cited as the statutory authority for the making of the first
order sought, and SCR Pt 13 r 2 as the
authority for the second.  By Pt 15 r 26
the court is empowered to make such an order, relevantly, where the
pleading:
<P>

(a)	discloses no reasonable defence;
<P>

(b)	has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings, or
<P>

(c)	is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.
<P>

4   	Pt 13 r 2 permits summary judgment to be entered for a
plaintiff where:
<P>

(a)	there is evidence of the facts on which the claim is based; and
<P>

(b)	there is evidence given by the plaintiff or some responsible person that,
in the belief of the person giving the evidence, the
defendant has no defence
to the claim.  
<P>

5   	At the commencement of the hearing into the Bank's notice
of motion Mr Wilson appeared unrepresented.  He filed in court an
affidavit
sworn by his wife, the substance of which was as follows:
<P>

"I have no desire to attend the Supreme Court of New South Wales at any time to
participate in any way in these proceedings in person
nor to be represented by
legal counsel."
<P>

6   	Mr Wilson made clear that he claimed the right to have all
issues, including issues of law, determined by a jury.  I ruled
that the issues
raised by the Bank's notice of motion were issues of law only, and fell to be
decided by a judge sitting without
a jury.  On hearing that ruling, Mr Wilson
left the court.  The matter thereupon proceeded in the absence of both
defendants.
<P>

<b>The Application to Strike out the Defences</b>
<P>

7   	It is well established that the power to strike out a
pleading will be exercised only in plain and obvious cases.  In this
regard the
principles stated in <b>General Steel Industries Inc  v  Commissioner for
Railways (NSW) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a>, whilst specifically concerned with and
directed to initiating process, are equally applicable to defences.  If it
appears that a
real issue exists between the parties, even where it may be
obscurely or ambiguously or confusingly expressed, the power conferred
by the
rules ought not be exercised to prevent the litigation of that issue.  The
principle applies equally to applications under
either of the rules presently
invoked.  One particular circumstance that may justify the exercise of the
power is the prior conclusive
determination, adversely to the party who seeks
to raise it, of the issue raised in the pleading.  This is especially so where
the
determination was made in proceedings between the same parties:
<b>Scanlan's New Neon Limited  v Tooheys Limited </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2062%20WN%20%28NSW%29%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 62 WN (NSW) 53</a>;
<b>Stephenson  v  Garnett</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1898%5d%201%20QB%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1898] 1 QB 677.</a>  That is of present
relevance.
<P>

8   	In 1996 Mr Wilson instituted proceedings against the Bank
concerning the same property and the same mortgage.  The essence
of the claim
he there made was that the mortgage contract was void for uncertainty because
it provided for a variable rate of interest
which could be ascertained by
reference to data published by the Bank.  The Bank successfully sought an order
striking out the statement
of claim, relying on the same two rules as it now
invokes.  Master Greenwood dismissed the statement of claim (<b>Wilson  v  St
George Bank Limited, </b>unreported, 17 September 1996).
<P>

9   	Mr Wilson appealed to a single judge of this Division
(Hamilton AJ, 30 September 1996, (and to the Court of Appeal, Clarke
JA and
Abadee AJA on 28 October 1996).  He was unsuccessful on each occasion.  His
application for special leave to appeal to the
High Court was refused (11 April
1997).  The issue he then sought to litigate was his assertion that a loan
agreement providing for
a variable interest rate was void for uncertainty.  By
the refusal of his application for special leave to appeal to the High Court,
that issue has been finally and conclusively determined against him.
<P>

10   	Yet that is the substance of the defence he now pleads.
Included in his defence are the following passages:
<P>

"4.	These proceedings ... are the result of previous proceedings ... when the
judgments handed down were wrong and wrongful ...
 
<P>

[The judgments to which he there refers are the judgments rejecting his
argument that a contract providing for a variable rate of
interest is void for
uncertainty.  He goes on to identify by name the judges involved in the various
decisions.]
<P>

5.	The judges mentioned above in paragraph 4 all had before them the brief of
my case containing information about the fraud committed
by the banks ...
issuing variable interest rate loan contracts which are illegal under common
law.   Common law demands that there
be "certainty of terms".  And because, by
definition and in reality, <u>variable means uncertain</u> and <u>certain means
not variable</u>, loan contracts incorporating variable or uncertain interest
rates or terms are void for uncertainty ...
<P>

8.	The judges mentioned above in paragraph 4, all perverted the course of
justice ... in that ... a court must declare that loan
contracts incorporating
variable interest rates are void for uncertainty ...
<P>

10.	This defendant denies that the plaintiff has any right to claim a Writ of
Possession because plaintiff has acted fraudulently
by making out that the loan
contracts ... are valid when variable interest rates, incorporated into those
contracts, render those
contracts void for uncertainty." (emphasis in
original)
<P>

11   	The issue thus sought to be raised by Mr Wilson is
precisely the issue he has already unsuccessfully litigated throughout
all
tiers of the NSW judicial system.  Those paragraphs must be struck out.
<P>

12   	I have carefully examined the document in an attempt to
discern any other defence of substance which might, however unintelligibly
pleaded, lie there concealed.  The remaining paragraphs in the document contain
the following:
<P>

"1.	This defendant denies the validity, ie, the truth and soundness, of the
plaintiff's Statement of Claim.
<P>

2.	This defendant invokes the power, purpose and function of the Court which is
to establish the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth and to
administer Justice.
<P>

3.	This defendant calls upon the adherence by judges to their Oath of
Allegiance  and Judicial Oath which are to "be faithful and
bear true
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second" and to "do right to all
manner of people ... 
<P>

[This paragraph goes on to recite the alleged evil and fraud perpetrated by
banks, corruption of the judiciary, and matters to do
with the coronation of
the Queen of England].
<P>

6.	The judges mentioned above in paragraph 4 all have committed judicial
corruption ...
<P>

9.	This defendant, on 28 May 1999, has filed a Notice of Motion for the case to
be Tried by a Jury, accompanied by an Affidavit.
 Should a judge want to deny a
Trial by Jury, then that is the very reason there should be Trial by Jury
because it means the judge
has something to hide and that something can only be
that judges are corrupt ..."
<P>

13   	Pt 15 of the Supreme Court Rules contains the rules of
Court governing pleading.  R 7(1) provides:
<P>

"A pleading of a party shall contain, and contain only, a statement in summary
form of the material facts on which he relies, but
not the evidence by which
those facts are to be proved."
<P>

14   	It is  quite apparent from the extracts above that these
paragraphs do not plead any material facts relevant to the cause
of action.
They are incapable of providing the foundation for any defence to the statement
of claim.  In terms of r 26 they are incapable
of disclosing, alone or in
conjunction with any other pleading, any defence;  and they have a tendency to
cause prejudice, embarrassment
and delay in the proceedings.  They must be
struck out.
<P>

15   	That leaves paragraphs 11, 12 and 13.  Paragraph 11 is
framed in the following terms:
<P>

"11.	This defendant denies the plaintiff has any right to claim a Writ of
possession because the Memorandum of Mortgage ... and
the Mortgage, itself,
were not executed.  For the Memorandum and the Mortgage, itself, to have been
executed, the Mortgagee had to
lend money and no money was lent which
constitutes acting fraudulently on the part of the Plaintiff.  Herein the
annexure marked
"F" gives figures from the Reserve Bank of Australia pertaining
to the practice of money creation other than by the Reserve Bank
of Australia
which is the only legitimate source of money for the Commonwealth of Australia
while the Annexure marked `G' illustrates
an example of how the money created
by banks profits the banks."
<P>

16   	Prima facie, the first sentence alleges a fact which is
capable of being material to the cause of action and, if proven, constituting
a
defence.  Parts of the second sentence, although the logic is impenetrable, are
capable of being construed as the assertion of
a fact material to the cause of
action;  that is, on one construction, it denies the advances of money which
are the foundation for
the Bank's cause of action.  It is unclear whether the
third sentence is intended to plead a fact supporting the assertions made
in
either or both of the preceding sentences, or to make a fresh and different
assertion of fact.  It is incapable of doing the former,
and if it is intended
to do the latter, it asserts a fact which is incapable of being material to the
cause of action.  The third
sentence of paragraph 11 will be struck out.
<P>

17   	Paragraph 12 asserts: 
<P>

"The Memorandum in question stated an amount of $35,146-10 and the mortgage in
question stated an amount of $150,000-00.  Both these
amounts are the subject
of a Notice of Motion for Discovery."
<P>

18   	Although it may be that in this paragraph Mr Wilson
intended to assert some material discrepancy between the documents said
to
establish the Bank's cause of action, it is impossible to discern with any
clarity what issue he seeks to raise.  This paragraph
will be struck out.
<P>

19   	In paragraph 13 Mr Wilson pleads:
<P>

"This defendant asserts, because of the fraudulent activities of the St George
Bank Limited and the wrongful and corrupt judgments
awarded against him, that
not only should the Writ of Possession be struck out but that the Court should
institute proceedings for
the indictment of that bank and the judges named in
paragraph 4 above." 
<P>

20   	This paragraph appears to be a combination of a
reiteration of the claims made in paragraphs 4, 5, 8 and 10, and an assertion
that this Court should itself institute criminal proceedings against the Bank,
some serving and retired judicial officers of this
Court, of the Court of
Appeal and the High Court.  Any such action is entirely beyond the bounds of
the power of this Court.  The
paragraph will be struck out.
<P>

21   	There thus remains of Mr Wilson's defence to the statement
of claim the first two sentences of paragraph 11 which are set
out above.  If
either of the facts therein asserted is true, Mr Wilson would or might have a
good defence to the Bank's claim.  As
I read these paragraphs, they amount to a
denial of facts on which the Bank's claim is based and therefore concern facts
on which
the Bank carries the onus of proof.  It will be necessary to return to
these matters.
<P>

22   	Notwithstanding the affidavit sworn by Mrs Wilson which
was filed in court by Mr Wilson at the commencement of the proceedings,
it is
appropriate and necessary to consider the defence earlier filed on her behalf.
Although that document was filed as a "defence",
in form and substance it is
unrecognisable as such.  It is constituted by a hand written letter, which I
set out in full below:
<P>

"This letter is my answer to a request to provide a defence to the action taken
by St George Bank against John Wilson and myself
- Laraine Joy Wilson.  The
proceedings, to date, have been without my full knowledge or consent.
<P>

John wishes to pursue the matter even at the risk of self-destruction and the
loss of our home.  I do not.  I have no means of controlling
his actions, I
have no means of paying the mortgages or costs.  <u>Having signed the loan and
mortgage papers, unwillingly, under duress - my husband's - is something I
regret</u>."  (emphasis added)
<P>

23   	Were it not for the last sentence of this letter I would
have no hesitation in striking out the document.  There is clearly
no proper
pleading of any fact material to the Bank's claim.  Even the last sentence does
not, in terms, plead any fact which could
of itself constitute a defence or
partial defence to the Bank's claim.  In the light of recent decisions of the
Court of Appeal and
the High Court (eg <b>Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20194%20CLR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 194 CLR 395)</a> I am left with the uncomfortable feeling that, properly
advised, Mrs Wilson <u>may</u> be able to mount an arguable defence to the
Bank's claim.  However, it is not for this Court to impose legal advice or
representation
on an unwilling litigant and Mrs Wilson's subsequent affidavit
establishes that she does not wish to participate in the litigation.
 As it
stands, her "defence" does not plead material facts sufficient to establish a
defence and must also be struck out.
<P>

24   	That brings me to the Bank's claim for an order for
summary judgment under Pt 13 r 2.  Only two things potentially stand in
the way
of making such an order.  The first is the two remaining sentences in Mr
Wilson's defence.  The second is the possibility
that either defendant may wish
to reformulate his or her defence.
<P>

25   	In this regard it is relevant to examine the factual
assertions made by Mr Wilson, in the light of evidence adduced on behalf
of the
Bank.  The first assertion is that the mortgage memorandum was not executed,
but this is plainly contradicted by the affidavit
of Jan Cropp, sworn 22 July
1999 in which, not only is it deposed that the mortgage was executed, but a
signed copy is annexed. 
There can be no substance in Mr Wilson's assertion to
the contrary.  The pleading raises a false issue which can be resolved only
one
way, unless Mr Wilson's true intention is to suggest that his purported
signature on the document was a forgery.  To do that
he would be obliged to
plead in very clear terms to that effect.  He has not done so.  The second
assertion is that no money was
lent under the mortgage.  Again, this is
contradicted by the affidavits of Jan Cropp sworn 22 July 1999 and 2 August
1999, to the
latter of which are annexed copies of bank records supporting the
assertion.  In other words, there is apparently objective evidence
contrary to
the assertions made by Mr Wilson in the defence.  It is appropriate to take
this evidence into account under Pt 13 r
2.  
<P>

26   	Evidence of the remaining matters necessary to support the
Bank's claim is contained in the affidavits of Ms Cropp, and three
affidavits
sworn by Patrice Daly, a solicitor employed by the Bank's solicitor.  It is
only necessary to say that I am satisfied,
in terms of Pt 13 r 2 (1) (a), that
there is evidence of the facts on which the claim is based.  Further, Ms Daly,
by affidavit sworn
21 July 1999, deposed to her belief that Mr and Mrs Wilson
have no defence to the claim, thus completing the evidentiary matters
necessary
to provide the foundation for the relief available under this rule.  I am
satisfied that the Bank has established its entitlement
to such on order.
Accordingly, I propose to enter summary judgment for the Bank.
<P>

27   	It will be necessary for the Bank to prepare short minutes
of orders in accordance with these reasons.
