<b><u>013327/93 - WALTER FREDERICK KINGSMAN (FORMERLY KNOWN AS SEAN WALTER
FREDERICK MORDAUNT) v HEALTH ADMINISTRATION CORPORATION</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b> re notice of motion (see transcript page 12)
<P>

                         
<P>

 
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  The plaintiff, Walter Frederick
Kingsman, by notice of motion filed on 5 September 1999 seeks various orders.
I do not propose
reciting the detail of them.  It is sufficient to observe that
in general terms the plaintiff seeks an order for summary judgment
pursuant to
Pt 17 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  I note that the plaintiff is
unrepresented in the proceedings.
<P>

2   	It is relevant to recite something of the history of the
matter.  On 30 November 1998 the plaintiff by notice of motion sought
orders
for default judgment pursuant to Pt 17 of the rules in an application before
his Honour Hulme J.  I note that in those proceedings,
among other things, the
plaintiff took issue with the circumstance that the defendant's defence had not
been verified.  That issue
together with the claim for default judgment was
dealt with by his Honour who declined to make orders in the terms sought by the
plaintiff's motion.
<P>

3   	On 8 February 1999 by notice of motion the plaintiff again
sought orders for judgment pursuant to Pt 17 of the rules in proceedings
that
were dealt with on that day by his Honour Sully J.  Central to the submissions
advanced by the plaintiff on that occasion was
the submission that the defence
pleaded by the defendant, Health Administration Corporation, was bad for the
reason, as it appears
to have been put in the proceedings before his Honour,
that the doctrine of Crown privilege or immunity did not exist as part of
the
current law of Australia.  His Honour entertained submissions in that respect
and noted that the point might ultimately be decided
either in favour of the
plaintiff or the defendant at the hearing of the matter, but that it was
inappropriate for orders to be made
either pursuant to Pt 15 r 26 or Pt 17 r 9.
His Honour, after considering the merits of the matter, declined to make the
orders sought
in the plaintiff's notice of motion.
<P>

4   	It is against that background that the matter comes before
me today, the plaintiff having filed a further notice of motion
seeking in
essence the relief that he has previously sought before both Hulme J and Sully
J.  At the  commencement of the proceedings
I asked the plaintiff if he could
identify some material new fact or circumstance such as would justify me
embarking on a hearing
of an application that raises the same issues as those
before Sully J.  In response to that the plaintiff referred me to the decision
of the High Court in<b> Sue v Hill </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 30</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20163%20ALR%20648" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 163 ALR 648</a><b>
</b>.  As I understand the plaintiff's submission he seeks to argue that the
doctrine of Crown immunity is not available to the Crown
in the right of the
State or Commonwealth of Australia in the light of the court's decision in
<b>Hill</b>.
<P>

5   	The circumstance that the High Court decided<b> Hill</b>
after the plaintiff's notice of motion was before Sully J does not seem to me
to be the sort of relevant new circumstance that would
justify me embarking on
a fresh consideration of the same issues.  The plaintiff's argument based on
<b>Hill</b> is simply a further basis upon which he seeks to contend that a
defence pleaded by the defendant is misconceived.  I refer to paragraph
12 of
the amended statement of defence filed on 19 May 1999.  In these circumstances
it does not seem to me appropriate to reconsider
the merits of the very matters
which were previously agitated both before Sully J and Hulme J.  For that
reason I propose to dismiss
the notice of motion.
<P>

6   	Before doing so, I should indicate that I propose making an
order that the plaintiff is not to move the court for an order
for judgment
pursuant to Pt 17 r 9 or an order seeking to strike out any part of the
defendant's pleading pursuant to Pt 15 r 26
without the leave of a justice of
this court.  I raised that matter with the plaintiff in order to give him the
opportunity to address
such submissions as he may wish to about the
appropriateness of such an order being made.  The plaintiff informed me he did
not intend
to bring such further applications and therefore had no objection to
such an order being made.
<P>

7   	I consider it appropriate so to order for the reason that
during the course of submissions the plaintiff indicated in a general
way that
he considered the defence pleaded by the defendant to be unlawful and illegal
and he indicated that he would assert his
right to keep coming back to court
until that position was vindicated.  I have made clear to the plaintiff that
the issues that he
seeks to ventilate before me on the hearing of the notice of
motion are issues which he might properly raise at the hearing of the
matter
which I note is fixed for 1 February 2000.
<P>

8   	My orders are, firstly, that the plaintiff, Walter
Frederick Kingsman, not move the court for orders pursuant to Pt 15 r 26
seeking to strike out the whole or any part of the defendant's pleadings nor
for orders under Pt 17 of the rules for default judgment
without the leave of a
justice of this court.  I dismiss the notice of motion.
<P>

(Submissions re costs ensued (see transcript pages 12-15).  For her Honour's
order as to costs see transcript page 15 line 55 to
page 16 line 2).
