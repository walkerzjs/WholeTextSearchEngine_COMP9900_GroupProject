<P>

<b>				Appeal decision of costs assessor;</b>
<P>

<b>			Leave to appeal)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By amended summons filed 23 April 1999 the
plaintiff seeks  to appeal from the decision of the costs assessor Mr R J Moyle
dated
15 November 1998 pursuant to s 208L and leave to appeal pursuant to s
208M of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (as amended) (the Act).  The
plaintiff also seeks an order extending the time within which to institute this
appeal to
the date of the filing of the summons pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p51a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 51A</a> r 3(1) of
the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  Paragraphs 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10 of the
amended summons were not pressed.  The plaintiff relied on the affidavit of
Terrence Anthony
Sullivan sworn 9 March 1999.  The defendant relied on the
affidavits of his solicitor Douglas Knaggs sworn 31 August 1999.
<P>

<b><u>Extension of time to appeal</u></b>
<P>

2  	The costs assessor gave his reasons for his decision on 24
September 1998.  He issued a certificate of assessment of costs on
15 November
1998.  On 25 November 1998 the solicitor acting for the plaintiff forwarded a
letter to the costs assessor seeking further
reasons for his determination.  On
7 January 1999 the plaintiff's solicitors wrote a further letter to the costs
assessor seeking
a reply to his letter of 25 November 1998.  On 10 February
1999 the costs assessor replied to the plaintiff's solicitor directing
him to
the decision of <b><u>Attorney General for New South Wales v Kennedy Miller
Television Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 729</a> and informed the plaintiff's
solicitor that he was now <i>functus officio</i>.
<P>

3  	On 11 March 1999 the plaintiff filed his summons.  An amended
summons was filed on 23 April 1999.  The plaintiff should have
lodged his
summons by 15 December 1998, however it was actually lodged a little less than
three months after that date, and about
one month after the costs assessor
informed the plaintiff's solicitor that he (the costs assessor) was <i>functus
officio</i>.
<P>

4  	The court has a wide discretion when considering whether or not
to extend time to appeal.  The ultimate test is to do justice
between the
parties.  As a general rule, time will be extended if there is no prejudice to
the other party and appropriate orders
for costs or the imposition of other
terms of the extension adequately protect their position.
<P>

5  	The issue raised under s 208L of the Act, which will be referred
to in more detail later in the judgment is, in my view, of
importance to the
profession.  The defendant did not demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice
caused by the delay.  The plaintiff's
solicitor filed the summons within about
one month after he had been informed that the costs assessor was <i>functus
officio</i>.  It is my view that justice is best served if the plaintiff is
granted an extension of time in which to appeal.
<P>

<b><u>History of the matter</u></b>
<P>

(1)	On 20 October 1994 the defendant Mr Yonan, (who was the plaintiff in the
District Court proceedings) obtained an award of damages
in his favour in the
District Court, in the sum of $94,967.  The present plaintiff (who was the
defendant in the District Court proceedings)
was ordered to pay Mr Yonan's
costs.  The solicitors acting for Mr Yonan at the time of the arbitration, were
Messrs Smith Monte
Costa &amp; Carbone.
<P>

(2)	On 25 November 1994 Mr Yonan filed an application for rehearing.
<P>

(3)	On 28 May 1996 Judge Taylor gave judgment in the rehearing in favour of Mr
Yonan in the sum of $54,163.  
<P>

(4)	On 4 June 1996 Judge Taylor ordered that the Mr Lace pay Mr Yonan's costs
of the rehearing except for the costs of 29 March
1996 which were ordered to be
paid by Mr Yonan's solicitor.
<P>

(5)	Mr Lace has paid Mr Yonan's costs of the rehearing.
<P>

(6)	In relation to the costs of the arbitration, the plaintiff's current
solicitor telephoned Mr Charles Monte of the firm Smith
Monte Costa (as it then
was) and said to him "Have you rendered a bill of costs to Albert Yonan for the
arbitration?"  He replied
"We have not done that and I am not sure what our
position is as Mr Yonan has brought a professional negligence claim against our
firm, and it may be that we are not entitled to render a bill for the
arbitration."  In a further conversation Mr Monte informed
the plaintiff's
current solicitor Mr Knaggs that "We probably wont be charging any costs for
the arbitration but I will make some
enquiries of LawCover and the Law Society
as to what we can do in relation to disbursements such as counsel's fees."  The
solicitors
who acted for Mr Yonan in the arbitration proceedings have not and
may not ever render a bill of costs for the legal services that
they provided
to him.  At this point in time Mr Yonan has no obligation to pay his former
solicitors any legal costs or disbursements.
<P>

(7)	Mr Yonan's current solicitor Mr Douglas Knaggs served the plaintiff's
solicitor with a purported bill of costs for assessment
which included the
legal work carried out by the former solicitors in relation to the District
Court arbitration.
<P>

(8)	This "bill of costs" was referred to R J Moyle barrister for assessment.
<P>

(9)	On 26 August 1998 the plaintiff's solicitor forwarded a letter to the costs
assessor seeking to add six additional items to
the bill of costs.
<P>

(10)	On 4 November 1998 the plaintiff's solicitor forwarded a notice of
objections to the costs assessor and the solicitor acting
for the defendant.
<P>

(11)	The costs assessor forwarded a letter to the plaintiff's solicitor
concerning these additional items.  The plaintiff's solicitor
never received
this letter and consequently did not object to the items.  The sum of the items
in dispute is $2,950.  
<P>

(12)	On 15 November 1998 the costs assessor issued a certificate of
determination and assessed a fair and reasonable amount of costs
to be paid to
Mr Yonan in the sum of $24,329.04.
<P>

(13)	On 11 April 1999 the plaintiff filed a summons.
<P>

(14)	On 23 March 1999 the plaintiff filed an amended summons.
<P>

(15)	On 11 August 1999 by consent, it was agreed that if either party was to
dispute receipt of any of the costs assessor's correspondence
they were to
notify the other party in writing by 18 August 1999.  The plaintiff's solicitor
did not notify the defendant's solicitors
that they had not received the costs
assessor's letter relating to the additional items to be included in the
bill.
<P>

<b><u>Appeal from costs assessor's award of $24,329.04</u></b>
<P>

6  	The plaintiff submitted firstly, that the assessor erred in law
by carrying out the assessment as the defendant had not paid
any costs to the
solicitors who had acted for him in the proceedings, the subject of the
assessment;  and secondly, that those solicitors
have not rendered an account
to the defendant.  
<P>

7  	The current solicitor for the defendant Mr Knaggs says that he
followed normal practice.  He rendered a bill which covered the
costs of the
previous solicitor.  He was prepared to undertake to the court that any costs
received by the plaintiff that were owed
to the former solicitors would be paid
to them, or used to set off an amount of damages for allegedly not handling the
matter properly.
 It is to be observed that when the former solicitors acted
for Mr Yonan he received a higher verdict than he did when his application
for
rehearing was determined.  The current solicitor acted during the determination
of the rehearing.  There is no evidence to suggest
that Mr Knaggs gave an
undertaking to the former solicitors to pay their costs at the conclusion of
the District Court proceedings.
 Nor is there any evidence that the costs and
disbursements incurred by the former solicitors had been ascertained or agreed
upon.
<P>

8  	Section 208L of the Act provides.
<P>

<b>"208L Appeal against decision of costs assessor as to matter of law</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A party to an application who is dissatisfied with a decision of a costs
assessor as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine the
application may, in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, appeal to
the Court against the decision.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	After deciding the question the subject of the appeal, the Supreme Court
may, unless it affirms the costs assessor's decision:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs assessor, or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the
costs assessor to re-determine the application.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	On a re-determination of an application, fresh evidence, or evidence in
addition to or in substitution for the evidence received
at the original
proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

9  	In the notice of objections (at p 5) the plaintiff made the
following submissions to the costs assessor:
<P>

<b>"In this matter the Costs Applicant has not paid any costs to his Solicitors
in respect to the arbitration and those Solicitors have
not even rendered an
account to the Costs Applicant and it appears that those Solicitors are
unlikely to ever render an account.</b>
<P>

<b>The effect of proceeding with the Assessment, is to give moneys to the Costs
Applicant over and above the damages awarded and thus
enable the Costs
Applicant to make a profit at the expense of the Costs Respondent.</b>
<P>

<b>The Costs Respondent therefore submits that the Costs Applicant is not
entitled to be indemnified for costs which he has not incurred
and further
submits that the Costs Assessor not proceed with the assessment or in the
alternative not issue a Certificate of Assessment
until such time as the Costs
Applicant becomes liable for the costs of the arbitration."</b>
<P>

10  	In a letter dated 8 September 1998 by the plaintiff's solicitor
to the costs assessor, the following additional matters were
raised:
<P>

<b>"In his capacity as the current solicitor for the Plaintiff Mr Knaggs has
advised that he was forwarded by the Plaintiff's previous
solicitors the file
in relation to the arbitration proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>Mr Knaggs did not perform any of the work in relation to the arbitration
and, in fact, was not instructed by the Plaintiff until after
the re-hearing of
the Arbitrator's Award.</b>
<P>

<b>In his capacity as the current solicitor for the Plaintiff Mr Knaggs has
prepared the Bill of Costs which you have now been asked
to assess.  We submit
to you that seeking to have the costs of the arbitration assessed at this stage
is inappropriate and artificial
as no costs have been rendered to the Plaintiff
by the solicitors who did the work in relation to the arbitration and those
solicitors
have advised that no such costs might ever be rendered or,
alternatively, if they are rendered at some time in the future they will
be in
a limited amount.</b>
<P>

<b>As no costs are currently payable by the Plaintiff in relation to the
arbitration proceedings we submit that the Plaintiff is not
in a position to
seek payment of costs (which are in fact a reimbursement for party/party costs)
as he has no current liability for
any party/party costs.</b>
<P>

<b>We further submit that at this stage the Plaintiff's liability for
party/party costs is a contingent liability and depends on whether
or not his
previous solicitors seek such costs at any time in the future.  We further
submit that it is those costs for which the
Defendant is and will remain liable
in accordance with the Arbitrator's Award.</b>
<P>

<b>In summary we submit that costs only become so when they have been rendered
and that if the person who performed the work chooses
not to seek such costs
then, "costs" do not come into existence.</b>
<P>

<b>We submit to you that the Bill of Costs that you have been asked to assess
should not be assessed as it is not what it purports to
be i.e., "Plaintiff's
Bill of Costs Pursuant to Orders made on 20 October 1994".</b>
<P>

11  	In the costs assessor's letter of 24 September 1998 he sets
reasons in paragraphs 8 to 14.
<P>

<b>"8.	the Cost Respondent submits that this matter should not proceed because
there is an action afoot between the Costs Applicant and
his former solicitors
for professional negligence;</b>
<P>

<b>9.	the writer in a letter dated 9th September, 1998 drew attention to the
decision of <i>Isaacs v Cachia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 92</a> and to the decision in
<i>Cachia v Isaacs</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20366" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 366.</a>  At that time the writer indicated
that the costs the subject of the present application were "untainted by
negligence";</b>
<P>

<b>10.	the writer arrived at the conclusion in (9) above having regard to the
pleadings and particulars in the Assessment of Party/Party
Costs
(CL/90321/1998).  At the time of making an assessment in that matter it was
patently obvious from the chronology subsequent
to 25th November, 1994 (in
particular 16 and 18 of that chronology) together with the verdict and
judgement of His Honour Judge Taylor
DCJ that there was a potential cause of
action between the Costs Applicant and his former solicitors for advice which
may have been
between the Costs Applicant and his former solicitors for advice
which may have been given to the Costs Applicant to make an application
for
rehearing of the matter from the award of the Arbitrator.  The particulars
(Bill of Costs) at Items 73 - 76, Item 104 and Items
108 -111 indicate
settlement negotiations between the parties prior to the rehearing of the
matter before His Honour Judge Taylor
DCJ;</b>
<P>

<b>11.	the costs order before the Arbitrator, Mr C Jurd, was an order for costs
in favour of the Costs Applicant.  It was not an order
for costs in favour of
the former solicitors;</b>
<P>

<b>12.	the Costs Respondent submits that if an assessment and determination is
made in this matter the Cost Applicant may not account
for those costs to his
former solicitors.  The position is that the determination of party/party costs
made in the prior matter (CL/90321/1998)
exceeds the amount of party/party
costs claimed in this present matter.  Any determination made by the writer
would off set the Cost
Applicant's liability under the previous determination.
As between the Costs Applicant and his former solicitors the costs of the
former solicitors in respect to costs incurred and subject to the order of the
Arbitrator on 20th October, 1994 can be off set against
any claim for damages
made by the Costs Applicant against his former solicitors for professional
negligence;</b>
<P>

<b>13.	any proceedings between the Cost Applicant and his former solicitors are
not relevant to these proceedings because the costs for
which the Cost
Respondent is liable are not tainted by negligence and are separable from those
costs incurred by the former solicitors
subsequent to the award of the
Arbitrator made on 20th October, 1994;</b>
<P>

<b>14.	to accede to the submissions of the Costs Respondent would be to deny
natural justice to the Cost Applicant."</b>
<P>

12  	The plaintiff referred to s 199 of the Act which states:
<P>

<b>"Applications by clients for assessment of costs in bill</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A client who is given a bill of costs may apply to the proper officer of
the Supreme Court for an assessment of the whole of,
or any part of, those
costs.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	An application relating to a bill of costs may be made even if the costs
have been wholly or partly paid.  If the costs have been
wholly or partly paid,
the application is to be made within the period prescribed by the regulations
for the purposes of this subsection.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	If any costs have been paid without a bill of costs, the client may
nevertheless apply for an assessment.  For that purpose the
request for payment
by the barrister or solicitor is taken to be the bill of costs.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	In this section, "client" includes any person who is a party to a costs
agreement relating to the legal services for which the
bill of costs is given,
other than the barrister or solicitor who gave the bill or who provided the
services."</b>
<P>

13  	As the costs have not been paid, nor has a request for payment
by the former solicitor been made s 199(3) does not apply. 
The definition of
the words "bill of costs" appear at s 173(1).  It states:
<P>

<b>"Definitions</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	In this Part:</b>
<P>

<b>"bill of costs" means a bill of costs for providing legal services, and
includes a memorandum of fees;</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

14  	Section 192(1) of the Act provides:
<P>

<b>"Proceedings for the recovery of costs by a barrister or solicitor for
providing legal services must not be commenced or maintained
against any person
unless at least 30 days have passed since a bill for those costs was given to
the person in accordance with this
division."</b>
<P>

15  	In Saddington's <b>Legal Practitioner's Act Annotated</b> (Law
Book Co, 1937), at p 63, it is said, in the context of delivery of bills:
<P>

<b>"No order for delivery will be made where the solicitor makes no claim for
costs because in such a case there is no bill." </b>
<P>

16  	The defendant's former solicitors have neither rendered a bill,
nor have they indicated that they intend to make a claim for
costs. In fact,
there is evidence to suggest that they do not intend to charge for their
services.  There is no bill of costs.
<P>

17  	<b><u>Saddington</u></b> (supra) at pp 63-64 states:
<P>

<b>"The amount due to the solicitor cannot be ascertained until the amount of
the bill of costs has been agreed upon or has been ascertained
by
taxation..."</b>(now assessment)
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

18  	In other words, costs as between a solicitor and client can only
be ascertained either by agreement between them, or by an
assessment performed
by a qualified costs assessor.  There was no agreement between either Mr Yonan
or his current solicitor with
his former solicitor as to the quantum of costs
nor has an assessment of those costs taken place.
<P>

19  	It is my view a client does not become liable to pay the
solicitor's costs until either there is a bill of costs delivered
to the client
by the solicitor who performed the work or there is an agreement or an
undertaking by the current solicitor acting
on his or her client's instructions
to the former solicitor to pay those costs.  The corollary is that a party
which has a costs
order made against it is not liable to pay costs unless the
client has actually become liable for them.  While it may be true that
the
costs order was made in favour of the client not the former solicitor, the fact
remains that in the absence of a bill in the
proper form being delivered by the
former solicitors to the client or an agreement or an undertaking, no costs
have become due and
payable.
<P>

20  	Secondly, despite Mr Knaggs' assertion, it is not "normal
practice" to render a bill of costs which includes costs of a previous
solicitor where that solicitor has neither rendered a bill nor asserted a lien
for unpaid costs over the client's documents.  Had
the previous solicitors
asserted such a lien, then it would have been incumbent upon Mr Knaggs to
ensure that their costs were adequately
secured. However there is no evidence
to suggest that any such lien existed.
<P>

21  	For these reasons I find that the decision of the costs assessor
has not erred in law.  The appeal should be upheld and the
decision of the
costs assessor of 15 November 1998 should be set aside.  If the former
solicitors render a bill of costs in due course
that bill of costs may be the
subject of a costs assessment application.
<P>

<b><u>Leave to appeal on amount in dispute</u></b>
<P>

22  	If I am wrong, I turn to consider whether leave to appeal should
be granted on the separate issue of disputed amounts which
totals $2,950.
Section 208M of the Act provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in
accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of the
Court to
appeal to the Court against the determination of the application made by a
costs assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A party to an application relating to costs payable as a result of an
order made by a court or a tribunal may, in accordance with
the rules of the
court or tribunal, seek leave of the court or tribunal to appeal to the court
or tribunal against the determination
of the application made by a costs
assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Supreme Court or court or tribunal may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine the
appeal.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or
evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the
original proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

23  	In seeking to appeal under s 208M the applicant requires
material, other than, or in addition to, a point of law in order to
be
successful.  This section provides that such an application requires leave in
accordance with the rules of the court.
<P>

24  	I have read Master Greenwood's decision in <b><u>Busuttil v
Holder &amp; Anor</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 9 August 1996).  In particular I
agree with his comments on the applicable test for leave.  He says:
<P>

<b>"Thus whilst each application for leave to appeal is to be determined on its
merits and I heed the statement of the High Court in
Adam P Brown Male Fashions
Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 170</a> that it is "unnecessary and
unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria" for the grant of leave to
appeal, as the circumstances
of different cases are "infinitely various"" I can
see nothing in what is before me that leads me to a conclusion that I ought to
look to the question of leave other than to apply the criteria of an obvious
error on the face of the record and substantial injustice
done to the plaintiff
if the determination of the costs assessor is allowed to stand."  </b>
<P>

25  	The amount in dispute is $2,950.  The total allowed by the costs
assessor as a reasonable amount was $24,329.04.  The amount
in dispute is one
eighth of the amount of costs allowed.  The plaintiff did not comply with
directions agreed to by the parties on
18 August 1999 and did not notify the
defendant's solicitor that he had not received the costs assessor's letter
concerning the additional
items.  Even if I accept that the costs assessor
should not have allowed these costs and take the above matters into account, it
is my view that there is no substantial injustice done to the plaintiff if the
determination of the costs assessor is allowed to
stand.  I would have refused
leave to appeal pursuant to s 208M of the Act.  
<P>

26  	Costs should follow the event.  The defendant is to pay the
plaintiff's costs.
<P>

27  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The time to lodge an appeal is extended to 23 April 1999.
<P>

(2)	The appeal is upheld.  The decision of the costs assessor dated 15 November
1998 is set aside.
<P>

(3)	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
