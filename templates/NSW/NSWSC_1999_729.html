<b>1965/99 - DAWSON V HOWARD &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR :  </b> Edward Dawson died on 29 May 1979.
Probate of his last will dated 20 March 1978 was granted to the defendants on
23 August 1979.
 The testator died a widower with one son, the plaintiff.  The
testator's two wives, the plaintiff's mother and stepmother both predeceased
the testator.   
<P>

2   	The plaintiff at the time of his father's death was aged
about 53.  He is currently under the protection of a guardianship
order because
the Guardianship Tribunal considered he was incapable of managing his property
or affairs.  Medical evidence shows
that he has what Dr Tedeschi described as a
mild development disability.  He has severe health problems, but Dr Tedeschi
said that
he actually appears less able than he really is.  She says in her
report of 18 February 1998, "He had almost no formal education
(one day, he
reckons) and cannot read or write effectively.  However, he is certainly at
present, an amiable gentleman, who can follow
the sport on TV, discuss his
health sensibly and understands his medical problems to a degree.  He has
formed a stable and loving
relationship with his wife Barbara who is also
mildly intellectually disabled.  Mr Dawson enjoys drawing and colouring in,
both of
which he does extremely well.  He can write his name.  I believe he
could have learnt a great deal more if given more opportunities."

<P>

3   	The doctor's report then went on to say, "Mr Dawson is
likely to have numerous medical appointments over the next few years.
 He will
need a good wheelchair.  His medications are expensive.  His home could do with
some decent furniture and he would benefit
from holidays away.  Mrs Dawson has
just been diagnosed with breast cancer and may very well need a mastectomy and
subsequent rehabilitation.
 Mr Dawson could certainly do with some help
(cooking, cleaning etc) in this period.  The quality of his nutrition is poor
and his
clothes are only just adequate.
<P>

"Mr Dawson is a happy man, despite his constant severe back pain and
breathlessness.  However, in the few years left to him, his
standard of living
could certainly stand improvement in the above ways, if there were adequate
funding ...".
<P>

4   	Dr Nicola Duncan who took over Dr Tedeschi's role, made
similar observations. 
<P>

5   	The plaintiff was the testator's only son.  By his will,
the testator, after making provision for various legacies, gave the
rest and
residue of his estate to his trustees on trusts.  The primary trust was as
follows:
<P>

"(a)	To pay or apply the net income arising therefrom in or towards the
maintenance support and benefit of said son <u>BRYANT EDWARD GERRARD DAWSON
</u>during his lifetime with full and complete power to my Trustees if at any
time my trustees consider that the income of my residuary
estate is
insufficient for the proper maintenance support and benefit of my said son to
have recourse from time to time to the capital
of my residuary estate to make
the said income up to such a sum as shall in the opinion of my Trustees be
proper and sufficient and
adequate for the maintenance support and benefit of
my said son <u>BRYANT EDWARD GERRARD DAWSON </u>during his lifetime <u>AND I
DIRECT </u>that my said Trustees shall during the lifetime of the said
<u>BRYANT EDWARD GERRARD DAWSON </u>pay to his guardian <u>ESTELLE MURIEL
CLANCY </u>such amount per week as my said Trustees shall deem in their sole
discretion to be sufficient and adequate for the proper maintenance
support and
benefit of my said son whilst he is in the care and control of the said
<u>ESTELLE MURIEL CLANCY</u>."
<P>

6   	Clause 4(b) of the will then provided in summary that after
the plaintiff's death the residue was to be divided into two equal
parts, one
for such of the grandchildren of Joyce Howard living at the death of the
plaintiff who attained 18, and the second part
under certain circumstances
would pass to Estelle Muriel Clancy or in other circumstances to such of the
great grandchildren of the
testator's sisters and brothers as should be living
at the plaintiff's death and who attained 18.  
<P>

7   	The will then provided in clause 5 that there was a power
to invest any funds requiring investment in certain securities. 
However, there
was no power to accumulate income in the will, there was no alternative
provision or gift over of any surplus income
to any person.
<P>

8   	The trustees were Mrs Howard who was the testator's niece
and who is the mother-in-law of the other trustee, Mr Peter Prior,
solicitor.
It would seem that Mr Prior had known the testator personally for very many
years, and had prepared the will.  Mr Prior
and his wife have five children.
Mrs Howard has another four grandchildren whose father is her son Ian.
Accordingly, the children
or grandchildren of the trustees will, in due course,
inherit the capital of the estate or at least 50% of it.
<P>

9   	What has happened since the death of the deceased is well
set out in the affidavit of Mr Prior.  He says that shortly after
the plaintiff
commenced to live with Mrs Clancy, there was a discussion between Mrs Clancy,
his mother-in-law and himself about the
plaintiff's needs and an agreement was
reached as to a weekly amount which would be paid to Mrs Clancy to meet those
needs.  After
the plaintiff stopped living with Mrs Clancy and went to live at
Bidwell House, there was a subsequent agreement with the Department
of
Community Services in which a regular payment was made on a weekly basis to the
Department or to a controlled account of the plaintiff's
which was being
supervised by the Department.  Additionally, when further needs arose based on
discussions with the departmental
officers and the trustees, special payments
would be made.  
<P>

10   	Mr Prior also says, "Mrs Howard and I have never had any
discussion concerning the allocation or application of the entire
net income of
the estate for the benefit of Bryant. ... I have never turned my mind to the
possibility of paying, applying or allocating
the entire net income of the
estate for any particular year to, or for the benefit of, Bryant.  My approach
has always been to try
and determine what Bryant's needs are and to pay or
apply for his benefit an amount which, after discussion with Mrs Howard, I
considered
was appropriate to meet those needs."  
<P>

11   	The evidence, particularly the cross examination, showed
that in actual fact, as is quite understandable, Mrs Howard virtually
left all
of the administration of the estate to Mr Prior.  The evidence also shows that
in practice Mr Prior left everything to his
accountant, Mr Farr, and to his (Mr
Prior's) secretary.
<P>

12   	In about 1988, Mr Prior realised that income tax returns
for the estate had not been filed.  His evidence is that he asked
his
accountant, Mr Farr, to remedy the breach.  Mr Farr did so.  According to Mr
Prior, Mr Prior just signed what Mr Farr had prepared
and submitted it to the
Taxation Department.  
<P>

13   	The taxation returns were prepared on the basis that the
whole of the income for the year was the income of the plaintiff
and that what
was not expended was treated as a loan back to the estate.  The estate then
lent out the capital and accumulated income
on first mortgage.  The fund has
grown from $65,000 to $220,000.  The way in which the accounts have been kept
for taxation purposes
and the income tax returns that have been submitted show
that the capital has remained at $65,000.    
<P>

14   	The trustees gave evidence that in fact there was no
attention given to this matter and that the accountant, Mr Farr, merely
treated
the accounts in this way without instructions.  Mr Hodgson, for the plaintiff,
says that actually the only proper explanation
of the accounts is that the
trustees have exercised their discretion and attributed the whole of the income
to the plaintiff and
that the accumulated income should now be paid over to the
plaintiff.  Alternatively he puts that the income tax returns must be
taken as
showing the true position with the same result flowing.  
<P>

15   	Mr Carnovale for the defendants says that when one looks
at the evidence in the case there never was any determination made
by the
trustees at all.  He says that on the proper construction of the will what was
to happen to the fund was that it was to be
used as far as possible in the
maintenance of the life tenant but anything that was not used was to accumulate
as capital.
<P>

16   	There are some problems with the interpretation which Mr
Carnovale urges.  One problem is that there is no mention in the
will of any
clause empowering the trustees to accumulate the income.  The second is that
the Thellusson Act would in any event have
restricted accumulations, certainly
if they were to take effect more than 21 years after the date of the deceased's
death.  
<P>

17   	Mr Carnovale says that one must sit in the testator's
armchair when viewing his will.  This is quite an orthodox approach.
 However
Mr Carnovale says that when one is sitting in the testator's armchair one can
see that here provision is being made for
a son who is intellectually disabled,
who will probably never marry and who is likely to have all his needs met out
of income.  
Why would any such testator want the surplus income either to be
paid to the son which he would not know what to do with or to be
accumulated to
the son and so pass to the Crown as bona vacantia?
<P>

18   	Mr Hodgson says first that that submission is not a
legitimate application of the armchair rule, but that even if it was,
there is
no material to suggest that the testator ever thought as to whether his son
would marry or not, and in fact the son has
married.  Furthermore, the
submission does not answer the fact that the son has, on the material, more
needs than the trustees have
met and that it was not legitimate for them merely
to come to an agreement with the carer for the time being as to how much was
needed
for pocket money and thereafter to retain the balance when the son had
so many needs, as indicated by the doctors' reports.  
<P>

19   	Whilst the armchair approach is, as I have said, an
orthodox one, I do agree with Mr Hodgson that Mr Carnovale is taking the
approach too far.  There is nothing to show one way or the other that a person
in the testator's armchair would have directed attention
to what was happening
to any surplus and whether the odds favoured the surplus becoming bona
vacantia.
<P>

20   	The principal problem is that the will does not contain
any clause permitting income not used to be accumulated let alone
indicating
where such accumulation is to go.  
<P>

21   	One reading of the will is that the trustees are to spend
the whole of the income for the plaintiff's benefit - that is the
minimum they
are to provide for him, and then they are to cast their minds as to whether
that minimum is sufficient.
<P>

22   	There is a lot to be said for this construction.  The
words "in and towards" reinforce this.
<P>

23   	Next there is a general rule that when one sees a gift of
income without any gift over to a particular named person for a
particular
purpose, that ordinarily the purpose is a mere indication of motive and does
not cut down the out and out gift.  <b>Theobald on</b> <b>Wills</b> 14th ed
(Stevens &amp; Sons, London, 1982) p 513, quoting <b>Re Osoba </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1978/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] EWCA Civ 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 WLR
247</a>, 257;  <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1978/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] EWCA Civ 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20All%20ER%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 All ER 393</a>, 402, says that generally speaking if the whole
of a fund whether capital or income is given to a beneficiary, even though the
purpose
of the gift is stated, it is taken to be a gift of the whole fund.  
<P>

24   	This sort of case is in contradistinction to the case
where the gift is the whole fund or so much as is necessary to fulfil
the
purpose as was the case in <b>Re Sanderson's Trust </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1857/731.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1857] EngR 731</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281857%29%203%20K%20%26%20J%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1857) 3 K &amp; J 497</a>;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20ER%201206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 ER 1206</a> (see K &amp; J at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=507%20ER%201210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">507;  ER 1210).</a>
<P>

25   	There are many examples of cases which fall into the first
category.  Most of the cases are listed by McLelland J in <b>Sacks v Gridiger
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20502" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 502</a>, 508.  Probably the best example is <b>Re Bowes
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%201%20Ch%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 1 Ch 507</a>, where a bequest of money to be laid out in planting trees
on an estate was held to be a bequest to the persons entitled to the land
which
was designated for the planting of the trees.
<P>

26   	Sometimes the gift will be construed as being conditional
upon the beneficiary using the moneys for the stipulated purpose.
 The classic
example of this is <b>Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) v Hindmarsh </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1948/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1948] NSWStRp 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2048%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 48 SR
(NSW) 454.</a>  In that case the testatrix gave money to her grand-nephew for his
maintenance as a boarder at Riverview.   The boy went to St Aloysius
College
and Sugerman J held that attending Riverview was a condition and accordingly
the child did not take the money.
<P>

27   	As a further indication that the plaintiff was to take the
whole of the income it is to be noted that the words used by the
testator are
"maintenance support and benefit".  In such a context the word "benefit" is
usually construed extremely widely;  see
<b>Re Peel </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1936%5d%20Ch%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1936] Ch 161.</a>
<P>

28   	Where, however, the beneficiary is suffering some
disability, the court is more likely to uphold a contention that the
beneficiary
is not absolutely entitled, but is entitled to have the trustees
exercise their discretion as to how the beneficiary will be paid
the money.
One case of this type which was cited in argument is <b>Bagots Executor Trustee
Co Ltd v Minda Home Inc </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2062%20SASR%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 62 SASR 596.</a>  In that case the will
essentially provided that the fund be held on trust so that the income would be
used for some competent humane
and conscientious person with nursing training
to care for the son of the testator rather than have him institutionalised.
Millhouse
J at p 602 set out the general principle that an absolute gift
followed by directions as to the use of the gift will usually stand
as an
absolute gift.  However he held that the circumstances of that particular case
meant that there was virtually a discretionary
trust in favour of the son.  He
said at p 603, "This is not the case of gifts with a superadded purpose which
may be disregarded
and the gifts accordingly are absolute."
<P>

29   	I consider that the flavour of the present will is much
the same.  The testator did not want the plaintiff to receive the
money in cash
but wished to make sure that he was well provided for.  
<P>

30   	It seems to me that on the proper construction of the
will, the testator intended that the plaintiff should only receive the
income
in a way which would be for his benefit. 
<P>

31   	However, there is no warrant for the trustees deciding
that the plaintiff could do with less than the whole of the income
(though they
could have decided that the whole of the income was not enough).  There is no
warrant at all in accumulating the surplus
to be capital for the benefit of the
remaindermen.  Putting out of one's head altogether that the remaindermen were
the children
or grandchildren of the trustees, there is just no warrant for
doing it.  There is no accumulation clause and nothing in the will
to suggest
that the whole of the income was not to be used for the plaintiff.  
<P>

32   	Indeed it may well be that any surplus does not go to the
remaindermen, but is undisposed of property which may go to the
next of kin;
see <b>Berry v Green </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%20AC%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] AC 575</a>, 582.
<P>

33   	In any event, the evidence in this case shows that indeed,
the plaintiff has needs which have not yet been met.
<P>

34   	In my view the trustees have not yet exercised their
discretion as to how the income should be devoted.  I do not consider
that the
exercise is as easy as Mr Hodgson suggests, and that is to just treat the
income tax returns as being correct and consider
that the money is absolutely
that of the plaintiff with power for him to do anything with it that he wishes.
The income tax returns
are correct in that the money must be taken to be
beneficially belonging to the plaintiff but only in the sense that it is to be
wholly used for his benefit.  The trustees have not exercised their discretion,
see <b>Turner v Turner </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20Ch%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] Ch 100</a>, and they must now do so.
<P>

35   	This is not a case where the trustees have a discretion as
to whether they will apply the fund for the plaintiff, rather they
have merely
a limited discretion as to the time and manner that the money shall be devoted
for that purpose;  see <b>Re Weaver </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2021%20Ch%20D%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 21 Ch D 615</a> and Underhill and
Hayton <b>Law of Trusts and Trustees </b>15th ed (Butterworths, London, 1995) p
671.
<P>

36   	Mr Carnovale puts that this goes too far and that all that
is really conferred is a trust power.  However, to my mind there
is a straight
trust giving the whole of the income (supplemented by capital if need be) to
the trustees to be used for the benefit
of the plaintiff.
<P>

37   	Accordingly, I can make declaration 1(i) in the summons,
but I do not consider that I should make the remaining orders.  What
should now
happen is that those who have the interests of the plaintiff at heart must
formulate a scheme for the application of the
accumulated income and put that
scheme to the trustees.  If the trustees consider that the scheme is
appropriate, they may pay the
income in accordance with it.  If the trustees do
not consider that that scheme is sufficient or appropriate and agreement cannot
be reached, then the court will need to decide.
<P>

38   	As I am proceeding on long leave, I will refer all
remaining matters in the proceedings including questions of costs to a
Master.
