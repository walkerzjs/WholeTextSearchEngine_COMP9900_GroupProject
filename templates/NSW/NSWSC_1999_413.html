<P>

<b><u>L00008/93  -  REGINA  v  Michael John ALEXANDER</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 14 September 1993 the prisoner, Michael John
Alexander, made application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a>.  He sought
a redetermination of the two life sentences imposed by Slattery J on 28 July
1987.  The sentences were imposed after
a jury had found Mr Alexander guilty of
the murders of Mrs Susan Kirk, and her three year old daughter, Stephanie.
<P>

<b>The Circumstances of the Crime</b>
<P>

2	The applicant was born on 25 March 1961.  Mrs Kirk and her daughter were
murdered on Tuesday 20 August 1985.  The applicant was
then twenty four years
old.
<P>

3	Mr Alexander came to Sydney from the country.  Through a church organisation,
he was introduced in February 1985 to Mrs Kirk.
 She was then a woman aged
forty two years.  She had recently separated from her husband, and had the
custody of her daughter, Stephanie,
aged three years.
<P>

4	Mr Alexander reached an arrangement with Mrs Kirk whereby they would share
premises, and the rent.  On 20 August 1985, there was
an argument between Mr
Alexander and Mrs Kirk concerning the rent, which was then in arrears.  Mr
Alexander then went to the garage.
 He obtained a length of electrical cord.
He returned to the kitchen.  He approached Mrs Kirk from behind, and placed the
cord around
her neck, pulling it tight.  He thereby strangled her.
<P>

5	Having done that, the applicant then carried or dragged the body to the
garage.  He was in the process of covering the body with
a curtain when
Stephanie, the three year old daughter, entered the garage.  He struck her with
a piece of wood.  He also stabbed
her, and stabbed Mrs Kirk.
<P>

6	A post mortem examination of Mrs Kirk identified strangulation as the primary
cause of death, and a knife wound to the lung and
the aorta as secondary
causes.
<P>

7	The post mortem in respect of Stephanie revealed that she had died as a
result of a knife wound to the heart.  She also had a
fractured skull, and
brain damage, as well as other stab wounds to her body.
<P>

8	Mr Alexander thereafter concealed the knife, and the piece of wood, in a
septic tank near the garage.  He then went to work. 
He arrived at 10.25 am.
He appeared calm and collected.  He disclosed to a woman at work, Ms Christine
White, what he had done.
<P>

9	As it happened, the police came to the factory that morning to investigate an
unrelated matter.  They were informed of Mr Alexander's
disclosures to Ms
White.  The police confronted Mr Alexander.  He endeavoured to laugh it off,
stating that his comments were a joke.
 The police, nonetheless, took Mr
Alexander to the premises.  They were unable to gain entry because Mr Alexander
claimed not to
have the keys.  He was permitted to return to work.
<P>

10	The applicant later returned home.  The bodies were removed from the garage.
They were placed under the house, and covered with
a curtain.  Mr Alexander
once more returned to work.
<P>

11	Meanwhile, the police obtained a duplicate key from the real estate agents
who managed the premises.  They entered the premises,
and found nothing
untoward.  They nonetheless returned to the factory, and arrested the prisoner.
He was to be charged with having
caused a public mischief.
<P>

12	Whilst in custody in respect of that charge, Mr Alexander disclosed to the
police what he had done.  The police then returned
to the premises with the
applicant.  The bodies, covered by a curtain, were then found.  Mr Alexander
was taken back to the police
station and interviewed.  He signed a record of
interview, which included the following questions and answers:
<P>

	"Q29.	Would you care to tell me where Susan Kirk was when you strangled
her?
<P>

	A.	In the kitchen near the phone.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q30.	Would you care to tell me how you strangled Susan Kirk?
<P>

	A.	I grabbed her and put the cord around her neck.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q31.	Can you tell me where the young girl, Stephanie Kirk, was when you
strangled her mother Susan?
<P>

	A.	I did not see her.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q32.	Was she dead when you carried her to the garage?
<P>

	A.	I don't know I just assumed so.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q33.	How long after this did the girl follow you in there?
<P>

	A.	She came in behind me straight away.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q34.	What made you realise the girl had come into the garage?
<P>

	A.	I saw her.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q35.	What did you do when you saw the girl?
<P>

	A.	I grabbed the nearest thing and hit her.  I didn't know I was doing it.
<P>

	
<P>

	Q36.	What did you strike the girl with?
<P>

	A.	I think it was a piece of wood."
<P>

	
<P>

<b>The State of Mind of Mr Alexander</b>
<P>

13	It was evident from Mr Alexander's past, and from his description of his
state of mind at the time of these offences, that he
had a problem with both
alcohol and drugs.  In 1979, whilst living with his parents at Narrabri, he had
been convicted of various
offences, including possession of Indian hemp.  He
was disqualified from driving for a period of twelve months by reason of
alcohol.
 He was placed on a recognisance for an offence of larceny.
<P>

14	In 1982 custodial sentences totalling nine months were imposed for driving
whilst intoxicated, and breaching the recognisance.
 In February 1984 Mr
Alexander was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for break enter and
steal, with a minimum term of six
months.  At the same time he was convicted of
two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  The person assaulted
was,
in each case, a Mrs Baker, with whom he was then living in a defacto
relationship.  Mrs Baker sustained a fractured jaw as a result
of the first
assault.  Her ribs were fractured as a consequence of the second.
<P>

15	The applicant pleaded not guilty to charges of murder before Slattery J and
a jury.  However, he did not contest that he had
been responsible for the
deaths of Mrs Kirk and Stephanie.  He sought, rather, to raise the partial
defence of diminished responsibility
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 23A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>).
<P>

16	Slattery J, in his remarks on sentence, summarised the psychiatric evidence
in these words:
<P>

	"Dr Jolly referred in his evidence to a delay in the prisoner's development.
He thought the prisoner had no gross brain damage.
 He thought, however, that
he had a mental state which he described as depersonalisation which he regarded
as an abnormality of mind.
 Dr Jolly expressed the opinion that the prisoner
was in such an abnormal emotional state that he could not exercise proper
control
over his emotions.  He also said, and this is relied upon by Mr Martin
in his submissions, that the prisoner became so angry and
anxious that his
usual control mechanism broke down.  Dr Jolly, who described the prisoner as
having an abnormal personality, said
that in his opinion a defence of
diminished responsibility was open to him.  This was rejected by the jury.
<P>

	Dr Wong, who examined the prisoner on 16 October 1986, was of (the) opinion
that he was not suffering any mental illness.  He said,
however, he had an
immature personality.  He was unrealistic in his outlook and was prone to
indulge in fantasy and to make grossly
exaggerated claims.  Dr Wong said more
than once that the prisoner had a fairly grossly immature personality."
<P>

17	Mr Alexander described the pattern of his drinking and drug taking.  He
started drinking heavily at the age of seventeen years.
 By the age of
eighteen, he was drunk almost every day.  Thereafter, he appears to have
moderated his drinking.  However, he began
to take drugs, including heroin.  By
the time of the murders, he was taking heroin daily.
<P>

18	In the days immediately preceding the murders, Mr Alexander drank a very
considerable quantity of alcohol.  He was also injecting
heroin.  He slept only
a short time before the argument with Mrs Kirk which culminated in her death,
and that of Stephanie.
<P>

19	The jury, having heard this evidence, rejected the defence of diminished
responsibility.  Mr Alexander was convicted of each
murder.
<P>

<b>The Remarks on Sentence by Slattery J</b>
<P>

20	By s 13A(9)(c) a Judge concerned, as I am, with the redetermination of a
life sentence, is obliged to have regard to relevant
comments by the sentencing
Judge at the time the sentence was imposed.  His Honour, Slattery J, made a
number of remarks which are
important, and relevant, to my task.  First, he
dealt with alcohol and drugs.  He said this, referring to counsel for Mr
Alexander:
<P>

	"Mr Martin did not place any reliance on the prisoner's consumption of
alcohol, as given in the evidence.  It is only fair to say
it was not relied on
at the trial either.  The evidence regarding his consumption of alcohol was
most unsatisfactory and undoubtedly
rejected by the jury, as I too would have
rejected it if I had been called upon to make a finding."
<P>

21	Counsel for the applicant in the present proceedings, does not suggest
otherwise.  His Honour's finding, therefore, is appropriate
in the present
context.
<P>

22	Secondly, his Honour dealt with the issue of premeditation.  The applicant
worked in a factory which produced electrical goods.
 Ms White was also
employed in the same factory.  She gave evidence of a number of conversations
with Mr Alexander before the murders.
 She did not take the conversations
seriously at the time they took place.  Mr Alexander described his problems
with Mrs Kirk, and
her daughter.  He described the daughter as "a brat".  He
announced that he planned to kill them.  When Ms White suggested that he
should
move out, the applicant insisted that it would be easier to kill them.  He even
indicated the way in which he could dispose
of the bodies.  It could be made to
appear as though Mrs Kirk and her daughter had met with an accident.
<P>

23	On Sunday 18 August 1985, two days before the murder, Ms White saw Mr
Alexander at the factory fashioning a noose out of wire.
 He wrote the word
"Sue" (being the Christian name of Mrs Kirk) on the end of the twisted wire.
<P>

24	The next day Mr Alexander said to Ms White:  "I've got to do it tonight."
He referred to Mrs Kirk as "PV", meaning "potential
victim".
<P>

25	His Honour concluded, not surprisingly, that the offence was "obviously
premeditated".  I see no reason to depart from that finding.
<P>

26	His Honour rejected the submission that the circumstances significantly
diminished the culpability of the applicant.  He, therefore,
imposed life
sentences in respect of each charge of murder.  When doing so, he said these
words, referring to the murder of Mrs Kirk,
which were amply justified:
<P>

	"The post mortem reports and the photographs in evidence disclose the ferocity
of his acts.  Not content with this sneaky, cool
and calmly executed act, he
stabbed her with considerable force in the chest, puncturing her lung and
aorta.  His attack upon her
was vicious and probably executed with all the
feelings of frustration and anger that had been brewing within him for days, if
not
weeks."
<P>

27	In respect of the death of Stephanie Kirk, his Honour made these remarks,
which I adopt:
<P>

	"Next, when three year old Stephanie Kirk innocently came upon him in the
garage where he had taken her mother, he bashed her twice
in a savage and
brutal manner on the forehead and the back of the head.  He also stabbed her in
the heart.  This treatment of the
young child was uncaring and brutal.  It was
a revolting and horrifying assault upon a young, innocent child.  Undoubtedly
the reason
for her death was because she stood in his way.  She was a person
who could identify him.  He regarded her a brat who had to be killed
along with
her mother."
<P>

28	I have read the victim's impact statement furnished by Mr Kirk (Ex F).  He
poignantly describes his anguish as a result of his
wife's death and that of
his beloved daughter.  Their deaths, naturally, turned his life upside down.
He resorted to alcohol.  He
lost his friends.  He ultimately found work so
troublesome that he resigned.  He felt impelled to leave the State in order to
escape
the torment which he was suffering.  His health deteriorated.  I am
constrained, as a matter of law, in the use to which I can put
this material
(<b><i>R v Previtera</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 76</a> at 85).  It is not
appropriate to take this material into account in the present redetermination,
and I do not do so.
<P>

<b>The Worst Class of Case</b>
<P>

29	The terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment has been
recognised.  Hunt CJ at CL in <b><i>R v Petroff</i></b> (unreported, 12
November 1991), said this:
<P>

	"The indeterminate nature of a life sentence has long been the subject of
criticism by penologists and others concerned with the
prison system and the
punishment of offenders generally.  Such a sentence deprives a prisoner of any
fixed gaol to aim for, it robs
him of any incentive and it is personally
destructive of his morale.  The life sentence imposes intolerable burdens upon
most prisoners
because of their incarceration for an indeterminate period, and
the result of that imposition has been an increased difficulty in
their
management by the prison authorities."
<P>

30	That notwithstanding, there are cases where such a sentence is appropriate.
They are characterised as the "worst class" of case.
 In <b><i>R v
Twala</i></b> (CCA, unreported, 4 November 1994), Badgery-Parker J (with whom
Carruthers and Finlay JJ agreed), stated the principle in these terms:
<P>

	"The argument that was put to us involved the proposition that because it is
possible to envisage, and indeed to find in the court
files, cases which are
worse than the present case, it necessarily follows that the present case is
not one appropriate to the imposition
of the maximum sentence.  I reject that
approach.  However, in order to characterise any case as being in the worst
case category,
it must be possible to point to particular features which are of
very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the
absence of
facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective
features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)."
<P>

31	In <b><i>R v Garforth</i></b> (CCA, unreported, 23 May 1994), the Court
(Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Mathews JJ) referred to an argument put on behalf of
the applicant,
which was as follows:
<P>

	"It was urged that the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, bearing, as it
inevitably does, no determinate minimum term, must
be reserved for those cases
where the offender is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the
rest of his or her life,
or alternatively for cases where there is no
reasonable prospect of rehabilitation."
<P>

32	However, the Court rejected that argument, it said this:
<P>

	"We reject the applicant's submission that it is only where there is no chance
of rehabilitation that the maximum penalty of life
imprisonment can be imposed.
There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the
community interest in retribution
and punishment can only be met through the
imposition of the maximum penalty.  As we have indicated, we believe that this
is such
a case."
<P>

33	The Crown did not urge that Mr Alexander's crimes should be characterised as
being in the worst class of case.  It, nonetheless,
said this:
<P>

	"If this Court determined the case was not `worst case category' it is
submitted that it is very close to it, and would require
a very substantial
minimum term coupled with an additional term for life."
<P>

34	I have been referred to a number of authorities where the Court, upon
redetermination, has decided that a life sentence should
be reimposed.
Although unquestionably the crimes of the applicant were callous and
horrifying, I do not believe that it is appropriate
to categorise them as being
within the worst class of case.  The applicant was guilty of multiple murders.
However, they arose out
of a single act.  They were not sequential, or serial
murders.  Nor were they cold blooded contract killings, or killings for
financial
gain, which have been characterised as being in the worst class of
case.  There was no element of torture, or sexual gratification,
which are
recurring elements in those cases which have been characterised by the Courts
as especially heinous.
<P>

35	A redetermination is therefore appropriate.  It is necessary, therefore, to
identify those matters relevant to an appropriate
minimum, and the additional
term.  The prospects of rehabilitation, and the potential for further harm, are
obviously important considerations.
<P>

<b>The Applicant's Incarceration</b>
<P>

36	Whilst awaiting trial, the applicant was incarcerated.  He wrote a letter
which was intercepted.  Upon the basis of that letter,
he was suspected of
having been involved in an attempt to escape.  He was, for a time, segregated.
After the period of segregation,
which was short, he was placed on protection.
One gathers that the nature of his crime, involving, as it did, a child,
created certain
difficulties with other inmates.
<P>

37	Mr Alexander has remained on protection for most of his sentence.  It is
recognised that incarceration is the more harsh for
those on protection.  They
are restricted in their movements throughout the system.  Their access to
privileges is curtailed.  These,
and other matters, are relevant to the length
of sentence, including the minimum term (<b><i>R v Davies</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2068%20Cr%20App%20R%20319" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 68 Cr
App R 319</a>;  <b><i>R v McCafferty</i></b> (Wood J, unreported, 15 October 1991);
<b><i>R v Potter</i></b> (Studdert J, unreported, 28 October 1991);  <b><i>R v
Hitchins </i></b>(Grove J, unreported, 3 June 1993).
<P>

38	The applicant lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence.  He was
seen by a psychiatrist on 24 September 1997.  He
told that person that Mr Kirk,
the husband of the deceased, was responsible for the offences.
<P>

39	Ultimately the applicant abandoned his appeal.  He nonetheless continued to
deny responsibility for the murders for almost a
decade after they had
occurred.  From the viewpoint of his rehabilitation, this was not promising.
<P>

40	On 17 September 1995, whilst incarcerated at Grafton gaol, he escaped with
another inmate.  They stole a motor vehicle.  They,
thereafter, broke into a
shop from which they stole food, and other items to assist in their escape.
The next day they stole a boat
and trailer, and various items from a dwelling.
Whilst washing themselves beside a river, they were rearrested.  They had been
at
liberty for less than two days.
<P>

41	Mr Alexander gave, as his explanation for escaping, that he wished to obtain
publicity for what he perceived to be "wrongful
convictions" on the two charges
of murder.  The Crown, somewhat charitably, said, in the course of submissions
before me, that such
a claim did not necessarily represent a continuing denial
of responsibility.  It was consistent with a feeling of grievance at the
rejection by the jury of the defence of diminished responsibility.
<P>

42	After his rearrest, the applicant spent a period in segregation.  He was
then charged with various offences.  He pleaded guilty
before his Honour, Job
DCJ.  Applying the principal of totality, a sentence of five years and four
months was imposed, consisting
of a minimum term of four years, and an
additional term of one year and four months.  The sentence was dated from 26
September 1996,
being the date of the hearing before the District Court.  An
appeal against that sentence was dismissed by the Court of Criminal
Appeal on
11 June 1997.
<P>

43	The escape, and the sentence imposed as a consequence of it, are obviously
important matters to which I am obliged to have regard
(s 13A(4) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act
1989</a>).  Barr J in <b><i>R v Fenech</i></b> (unreported, 4 September 1997)
referred to the authorities before the amending Act in 1997 which added
sub-section 4A.  He said this:
<P>

	"I think in view of these authorities that the proper approach in
redetermining a life sentence is to take into account subsequent
offences and
sentences not only for the purpose of ascertaining the applicant's stage of
rehabilitation but in order to fashion a
redetermined sentence which will
ensure that the applicant does not go unpunished or insufficiently punished for
offences for which
he is sentenced after the life sentence.  I think that the
principle enunciated by Hunt CJ at CL in <i>R v Purdey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2065%20A%20Crim%20R%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 65 A Crim R
441</a> applies to cases like this one just as it applies to life sentences which
are imposed on prisoners already serving sentences."
<P>

44	His Honour remarked that, if the principle was open to doubt, the doubt was
removed by the ss 4A which was added to the Act in
1997, and which was
retrospective, applying to all applications, including the present
application.
<P>

45	However, this aspect aside, there are a number of matters which have emerged
since the applicant was sentenced, which are favourable
to his application.  He
is described as intelligent.  He did not give evidence on the redetermination.
Nonetheless, the prison file
contains many of his letters.  The text rather
suggests they were written by him, rather than on his behalf.  He certainly
emerges
from the correspondence as intelligent and articulate, although
occasionally manipulative (see, for instance, his letter of 12 June
1994), and
occasionally untruthful (for example, his claims to have married in 1982, which
claims are rebutted by a considerable
body of evidence in the prison file).
<P>

46	He has also made good use of his time in prison.  He has undertaken a number
of courses, including Spanish and computer studies.
 He appears to have
recognised the importance of education to his rehabilitation.
<P>

47	He has also carved various wood sculptures.  He has won awards for his work.
Some of the sculptures were displayed before me
in court.  They were truly
remarkable.
<P>

48	The former head of the Serious Offenders Review Board, Torrington DCJ, had a
policy of not reclassifying prisoners on life sentences
before the
redetermination of their sentence.  Torrington DCJ's period in office concluded
in June 1997.  He was replaced by Enderby
J.  Enderby J had a different policy,
although the applicant, having escaped in the meantime, was not in a position
to claim reclassification
at that time.
<P>

49	The result has been that the applicant has spent his term in prison, not
only on protection, but classified Maximum Security
A2.  For a time, when at
Grafton before his escape, he was classified B.  Since his escape, he has been
classified E1, signifying
the maximum restraint under the classification
system, he now being a person with a history of escape.
<P>

50	Nonetheless, the commentary of those responsible for his supervision in gaol
has been almost universally favourable.  He is co-operative.
 He is described
as a good worker.  He has been given positions of trust.  Indeed, his gaol
record, in terms of discipline, is remarkable,
given his background, the length
of his incarceration (fourteen years thus far), and his classification.  On two
occasions only,
on 19 and 20 October 1996, he refused to comply with the gaol
routine.  He was given a reprimand and caution in respect of the first
occasion, and deprived of amenities in respect of the second.
<P>

51	There is only one other offence on his record, although it is important.  On
18 January 1999, as a result of a random urine test,
he was found to have drugs
(cannabis) in his urine.
<P>

<b>Drugs and Counselling</b>
<P>

52	A fundamental aspect of the applicant's rehabilitation, and his potential
for harm, is his attitude to drugs and alcohol.
<P>

53	The applicant, to his credit, appears to have avoided drugs whilst in gaol.
He told a psychologist in September 1987 that he
had stopped using drugs in the
remand centre, "when he decided that he didn't want to have to `rort' around
looking for enough heroin
to maintain a habit".  On 12 June 1994 he wrote a
long letter which included the following statement:
<P>

	"I have long ago realised that alcohol (and) drugs ... are not to be mixed, no
matter how small the doses.  I have learned the
hard way, so has society
..."
<P>

54	He repeated that statement to Dr Westmore whom he saw in February 1999.
<P>

55	The transgression in January this year was explained upon the basis of
exceptional circumstances, created by the deaths of inmates
who were his
friends.
<P>

56	What is perhaps more disturbing is the failure by Mr Alexander to seek drug
and alcohol counselling, notwithstanding repeated
suggestions that he should do
so.  He has had some counselling.  However, his attitude is a worrying feature
of his application.
 He appears to regard such counselling as having no
relevance to him, he having resolved to have nothing to do with either alcohol
or drugs.  His recent relapse in circumstances of stress demonstrates the folly
of that approach.
<P>

57	It is important to his progression through the classifications, following
this redetermination, that Mr Alexander should have
drug and alcohol
counselling, and counselling generally.  Should he falter in his resolve to
remain drug and alcohol free after release,
his past would suggest that there
is danger.  It is fundamental, therefore, that he addresses that danger.
<P>

58	Dr Westmore, speaking of Mr Alexander's progression to a lower gaol
classification, said this:
<P>

	"Q.	What sort of timetable would you see as desirable in terms of that
progression, are you able to say?
<P>

	A.	Not really clearly.  I mean he has been institutionalised for 14 years.
There will be a degree of institutionalisation, the
world has changed a great
deal in that time.  From a psychological perspective it is better if it is done
gradually than if it is
done quickly and what I mean by gradually is over a
period of months or years."
<P>

59	Dr Westmore described the supervision which should be provided following the
applicant's release on parole in these words:
<P>

	"A.	I think he initially should see a mental health professional at least once
a week to assist in monitoring how he is adjusting
and to assist him with the
process of adjusting and that should continue for at least twelve months and
probably longer in view of
the serious difficulties he has had before.
<P>

	I think he should have regular monitoring for drug in urine tests.  Alcohol
monitoring, that could vary but at least weekly and
possibly done on a random
basis but maybe up to three times a week if need be.
<P>

	I would think the support and supervision of the Department of Probation and
Parole, for example an officer from that service might
assist as well and that
person should or could liaise with the psychiatrist or the psychologist.  So
there are two areas of him being
covered.  Where he lives needs to be
supervised.  What work he does needs to be supervised.  So I can see it being
quite intense
initially.
<P>

	Q.	Would you see it as being finite or indefinite?  Again another hard
question.
<P>

	A.	From this point in his assessment it is difficult to say because a lot
depends on how he proceeded.  If three years down the
track there is no
suggestion he is likely to use drugs or alcohol, for example, that is a quite
significant thing but does not necessarily
mean he won't use drugs or alcohol
but it does mean you could lessen this supervision of the drugs and alcohol
that might have happened
at three or two years if he was showing signs of
progress and that he was getting a strong will.  So that is probably a decision
which needs to be made as to his progress during therapy and
rehabilitation."
<P>

<b>Risk in the Future</b>
<P>

60	The material before me, therefore, is both positive and negative.  Leaving
aside the escape, which is, of course, distinctly
negative, his prison record
is largely a positive aspect of his application.  His thirst for education is
likewise positive, as is
his willingness to work and his intelligence.
<P>

61	The negative aspects include the escape, and the recent positive urine
sample.  They also include an apparent reluctance to seek
psychological
counselling, and specifically, drug and alcohol counselling.  Mr Alexander
appears to have limited insight into his
conduct.  He does not see himself as a
violent man.  He does not regard himself as being like other murderers.  In
some respects
he is right.  He has not continued in prison the sort of brutal
conduct which his crime demonstrates is within his capacity.  He
appears to
have no real understanding as to why he so brutally murdered an innocent
child.
<P>

62	Dr Westmore did not believe the applicant was suffering from a major
depressive illness.  He had no psychotic features, such
as delusion or
hallucination.  It is clear from Dr Westmore's report that Mr Alexander was
something of a puzzle.  The puzzle arises
from the contradiction between the
reasonableness of his presentation, and conduct in gaol, and the extreme
brutality of his crime.
 In these circumstances Dr Westmore was left with some
concerns.  He explained those concerns in the following passage taken from
his
evidence:
<P>

	"Q.	You have got some concerns about Mr Alexander?
<P>

	A.	I do.
<P>

	Q.	Could you first of all tell us what those concerns are?
<P>

	A.	The concerns relate to two issues:  while there were some anti-social acts
and qualities to his personality before this offence
I do not believe the
extremeness of this offence could have been predicted on his previous
personality profile.  In particular, I
do not believe that the offence
involving the child could have been predicted and it is really very much
unexplained on the account
that we have from him.  So that is the first
issue.
<P>

	The second issue is that he presents relatively well at this stage from a
psychological perspective.  By that I mean when you examine
him now you cannot
easily identify any significant risk factors and that is an issue of concern I
have in some ways.  It is obviously
a positive feature but it also is a feature
of uncertainty about him."
<P>

63	Dr Westmore's ultimate conclusion, nonetheless, was in these terms:
<P>

	"Q.	Having said that there are reasons to be cautious about Mr Alexander, your
overall opinion is that the risk of reoffending
is low?
<P>

	A.	He does not present as being a high risk at this time."
<P>

<b>Sentence Redetermination</b>
<P>

64	Taking account of these matters - the shocking brutal and callous nature of
his crime, the aggravating feature that it involved
a three year old child, the
escape, and the sentence in the District Court for the offences associated with
the escape, the positive
and negative aspects of the applicant's conduct in the
last fourteen years, clearly a significant minimum term is called for, as
well
as close supervision after the applicant's release on parole.
<P>

65	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>, in respect of each of the life
sentences previously imposed upon the applicant, I set a minimum term of 21
years, to date from the
time the applicant went into custody on 20 August 1985,
and to expire on 19 August 2006, together with an additional term of 8 years,
commencing on 20 August 2006 and expiring on 19 August 2014.
<P>

66	The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 19
August 2006.  His reclassification should begin
as soon as possible.  He should
be encouraged, whilst incarcerated, to undertake counselling in respect of
drugs and alcohol, and
generally.
<P>

67	Upon his release, the applicant will obviously require close supervision,
incorporating the safeguards outlined by Dr Westmore.
