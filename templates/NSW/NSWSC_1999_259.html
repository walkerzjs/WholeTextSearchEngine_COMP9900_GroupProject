<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: I am presently presiding over a defamation trial and I use those
words advisedly.  The case has been called on as
a trial.  The jury has been
empanelled and has decided the issues left to it, with the result that the
plaintiff presently has the
benefit of the finding that the two publications
sued upon defamed him.
<P>

2	In the course of the trial, during which that component was dealt with, there
has arisen one major substantive interlocutory application,
that is, an
application by the defendant to amend its case against the plaintiff, on the
issue of justification.
<P>

3	In connection with that substantive application, there have been countless
subpoenas and notices to produce issued and served
as between the parties and
as far as I am presently aware, at least three other people, the Commissioner
for Police, Mr Quail and
a private investigation agent.
<P>

4	As part of the substantive application to amend the Defence, being dealt with
in the course of this trial, I had to deal with
a major issue of privilege,
which was the subject of a judgment delivered last Friday (19 March 1999 DLJT:
24). In the course of
that judgment, I acknowledged that the defendant's
position in relation to the issue of privilege was not restricted to the
substantive
application to amend but to access to material for the purposes of
the trial generally.
<P>

5	In the course of the progress of the application to amend, the point was
reached yesterday, remarkably, that Mr Angus, solicitor
for the defendant, who
has filed several affidavits, is finally in a position to be cross-examined.
<P>

6	At the time of the commencement of Mr Angus's cross-examination, I think it
fair to say that there was still an understanding
that some matters had to be
dealt with before the cross-examination of Mr Angus could be completed.
<P>

7	Amongst those matters that had to be resolved, was the question of a claim
for privilege raised by the Commissioner for Police
consequent upon Notice to
Produce served upon him.
<P>

8	With respect to the Notice to Produce, and a claim made in relation to the
documents sought thereunder, Howard Charles Bell, a
solicitor of this Court,
and a Senior Legal Officer of the Legal Service of the Police Service of this
State, has sworn an affidavit
today, to which is exhibited an envelope
containing documents which are now generally understood to be documents from
the solicitors
for the defendant.  In respect of those documents, no claim for
privilege has been made by the solicitors for the defendant.  Mr
Bell is
presently being cross-examined on that affidavit, in respect to the claim for
privilege, which he asserts on behalf of the
Commissioner of Police.
<P>

9	The point has been reached where I do not think I could, in an extempore
judgment, pretend to state without error or with abundant
clarity, the whole of
the context of everything that has been going on, but mention must be made, and
it is critical, of what could
be described as a concurrent substantive
application by the plaintiff, to have set aside a subpoena served by the
defendant on the
Commissioner for Police on or about 18 January 1999.
<P>

10	Submissions in writing in support of the disposition of the plaintiff's
motion favourable to that party, have been served on
the defendant and I have
been provided with a copy of those submissions.
<P>

11	Leaving aside for the moment, any question of standing, I focus on the
submissions which state that there are several bases upon
which a document
ought to be set aside which have been summarised as follows:  fishing,
oppression, relevance, discovery against
third party, abuse of process, no
legitimate forensic purpose.
<P>

12	Mr Angus, whose cross-examination has been suspended, was asked a series of
questions by Mr Barker Q.C. for the plaintiff, recorded
at Lines 5 to 15 of the
transcript at 528. The import of the evidence there recorded being that Mr
Angus does not accede to the proposition
that the defendant's subpoena was a
fishing expedition "<i>pure and simple", </i>and does not accede to the
proposition that it was an abuse of process.
<P>

13	As I have earlier indicated, the present matter involving Mr Singleton for
the Commissioner of Police, was commenced to be dealt
with, on the basis that
it would dispose of an impediment to the conclusion of the cross-examination of
Mr Angus. However, what has
happened is this:  that the cross-examination of Mr
Evans, on what hitherto had been considered to be not a peripheral but not a
major component of this case, within a case, within a trial, gave rise to the
introduction of what, on any reasonable basis, can
only be concluded to be a
new and surprising element.
<P>

14	That new and surprising element is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s125</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.  It is
surprising in this sense, that none of the submissions in support of the
plaintiff's application to set aside the subpoena,
nor the summary in the
document which Mr Nicholas handed up to me, makes any suggestion at all,
relating to the notion, not of an
abuse of process, but of <i>furtherance of a
deliberate abuse of power</i>, by a person concerned with this litigation.
<P>

15	That arose, namely the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> component, in this context.  Mr Bell was asked
this question by Mr Reynolds S.C.:
<P>

	"<i>Q.   One of the matters which you have considered as a legal adviser to
the New South Wales Police Service, when you have received
subpoenas from both
the plaintiff and defendant in these proceedings, is the forensic purpose for
which the documents are sought.
 Is that correct?"</i>
<P>

16	To which both Mr Singleton and as I recall, Mr Nicholas Q.C., or Mr
Wheelhouse objected.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">S125</a> raised its head in the sense that it was the
foundation relied upon by the plaintiff, through Mr Reynolds, as to the
relevance of
that question.
<P>

17	In addition therefore, to being not only surprising but also to being new,
the notion of a deliberate abuse of power has arisen
as between the plaintiff
and Mr Singleton's client (the Commissioner) and inexorably, as between the
plaintiff and the defendant.
The suggestion clearly has been made that the
question asked should be answered because it is relevant to Mr Bell being a
party to
the deliberate abuse of power, clearly understood now to be asserted
against the defendant.
<P>

18	As between the plaintiff and Mr Singleton's client, as a matter of fairness,
it can hardly be said that the question is justified
on the basis of some
evidence arguably available from the testimony of Mr Angus hitherto given, as
between the plaintiff and the
defendant, being used to lay the groundwork for
"<i>reasonable grounds" </i>for a finding in terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s125(2)</a> as between the
plaintiff and the Commissioner of Police.
<P>

19	If it is sought to have any claim for privilege made by the Commissioner set
aside by reason of the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, not only as a
matter of general principle, but acutely in the circumstances in which this
problem arose, the Commissioner is entitled
to particulars of what is alleged
to have been his conduct as a principal, accomplice, conspirator or participant
in the furtherance
of a deliberate abuse of power by the defendant.  In other
words, what did the Commissioner do? and particulars of the "<i>reasonable
grounds</i>" hitherto said to exist for making that assertion;  the
Commissioner is entitled to have the plaintiff ordered to provide such
particulars.
<P>

20	The position of the defendant is not quite the same because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> is applicable at present merely, if at all, to Mr Singleton's
position.  But if, however, on the plaintiff's motion to set aside
the subpoena
issued by the defendant, a basis is going to be asserted that a reason for so
doing is conduct of a kind akin to furtherance
of a deliberate abuse of power
as referred to in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, then that is something more than the
six matters listed on the document handed up by Mr Nicholas (MFI 9) and the
defendant would
be entitled to particulars.  The particulars in the submissions
delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant of which I have a copy
are
inadequate to sustain an allegation of that kind against the defendant if it is
to be relied upon as a basis for setting aside
that party's subpoena.
<P>

21	The immediate matter for concern is the area of relevance relied upon to
sustain the question to which objection is taken.  That,
as between the
plaintiff and the Commissioner of Police on the issue of the Commissioner
seeking to assert privilege, can only be
described as new and surprising, and
before any further cross-examination on that area, the plaintiff is required to
particularise
its position and, whilst doing so, if it proposes, as seems to be
the case, to make a cognate type of allegation against the defendant
to have
its subpoena set aside, it will be required to deliver the equivalent
particulars.
<P>

22	I am not disposed at this time to reject the question. That will depend upon
the articulation of the basis of relevance in the
particulars to be supplied.
They are to be supplied by 9.30am tomorrow morning.
