<P>

<b>Wednesday, 4 August 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>70064/98 - REGINA v Luke James NIXON</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The accused is charged with murdering his
mother Karen Louise Nixon.  He has pleaded not guilty.
<P>

2  	Notwithstanding his mental state, to which I shall refer later in
this judgment, the accused signed a document on 28 July 1999
under the
provisions of s 32 Criminal Procedure Act electing for trial by judge alone.  I
am satisfied that he received appropriate
advice before making his election.  I
am satisfied that the accused had the mental capacity so to elect.
<P>

3  	This trial arises out of a series of tragic events which must
have distressed the family and friends of the deceased.  In order
to spare them
unnecessary anguish I shall summarise only those facts that are necessary for
the Court to reach its verdict.  The
Court extends it sympathy to the
deceased's family.
<P>

4  	The deceased's brother, Mr Paul Barber, drove her home to her
flat at Moorebank on Monday 7 October 1996.  They had a cup of
tea together and
when Mr Barber left the premises at about 5.30pm he accidentally left behind a
packet of cigarettes.
<P>

5  	At about 6.45pm a passing motorist noticed a man in the driveway
of the deceased's flat, walking towards it.  His appearance
was consistent with
the appearance of the accused.
<P>

6  	At about 8.30pm neighbours heard a woman screaming, shouting that
she was being raped.
<P>

7  	At about midnight a taxi driver picked up the accused near the
Henry Lawson Drive exit from the M5 tollway at Milperra, a place
about a
forty-minute walk from the deceased's flat.
<P>

8  	The driver was concerned about the mental capacity of the accused
because of the way he spoke and because he was wearing only
a shirt.  He said
that he had lost his trousers in the river.
<P>

9  	The driver took him to an address in Warrawong, a suburb of
Wollongong, where two friends of the accused lived.  He asked them
to lend him
$120 for the fare.  They noticed that he was dishevelled and shivering and
seemed to be under the influence of drugs
or alcohol.  They asked him whether
his mother might lend him the money and he told them that he had not seen her
for a long time
and did not know where she was living.
<P>

10  	The deceased was found in her flat at about 8.15am on Tuesday 8
October.  She had been stabbed three times.  One of the wounds
penetrated the
heart and caused her death.  She was wearing the clothes she had been wearing
when Mr Barber brought her home.
<P>

11  	Investigating police officers established that a fingerprint of
the accused was on a coffee mug which Mr Barber had used and
left in the
lounge.  His packet of cigarettes was there.  Some cigarettes had been taken
from it and the packet bore the accused's
right thumbprint.
<P>

12  	There was no evidence that any struggle had taken place inside
the premises and no property was stolen.  A knife, which was
identified as
having come from the kitchen drawer, was found in the deceased's hands.  A
jumper, which had been given to the accused
by the deceased in 1995, was found
on a chair in the lounge.  It bore blood consistent with being from the
deceased, the DNA pattern
of which occurs at the rate of one in 750 in the
community.
<P>

13  	Police attempted to interview the accused on 10 October 1996 but
he was vague and irrational when answering questions.  Police
took him to the
Shellharbour Hospital where he was admitted to the psychiatric ward.
<P>

14  	The accused has a history of mental illness which came on after
he suffered a serious head injury in a motor vehicle accident
in September
1988, when he was twelve years old.  He suffered left-sided weakness and
impaired co-ordination.  His concentration
and short-term memory were affected.
School reports noted a change in personality and a decline in intellectual
ability.  He became
more aggressive, impatient and intolerant.  He was vague
and at times disoriented.  He suffered memory loss.  During the year after
the
accident he suffered post traumatic epilepsy with several motor seizures as
well as probably complex partial seizures.  He received
treatment with
anticonvulsant medication.
<P>

15  	He became despondent about the effects of his impairment on his
ability to understand school work and had to be referred to
the school
counsellor at his high school.
<P>

16  	He was awarded a substantial sum of money in damages to
compensate him for his injuries and disabilities.  He began to use
illegal
drugs.  He spent a substantial portion of his award on overseas travel and
drugs.
<P>

17  	On 17 April 1996 police were called to the house in which the
accused's mother was then living.  The accused was present, seemed
to be under
the influence of alcohol and was behaving irrationally.  He caused a
substantial amount of damage to the house and its
contents.  He admitted to
drinking and using amphetamines.  He was kept for a week in a psychiatric
hospital as an involuntary patient.
<P>

18  	During the months before his mother's death the accused visited
Bangkok and Amsterdam, where he used cannabis every day and
took other
stimulants and hallucinogens.  He returned to Australia about eight weeks
before his mother's death.
<P>

19  	Understandably, his mother, a woman of strong religious
conviction, disapproved of the kind of life he was leading.
<P>

20  	When he was taken to Shellharbour Hospital on 10 October 1996 he
was diagnosed as suffering from a psychotic illness on the
basis of the
presence of religiose and persecutory delusional beliefs, auditory
hallucinations and disorder of thought form.  He
was detained involuntarily for
three months.  According to his discharge summary, the provisional prognosis
was drug induced psychosis.
<P>

21  	In November 1997 he was admitted to yet another psychiatric
hospital as an involuntary patient.  His diagnosis was schizophrenia
and he was
treated with high doses of anti-psychotic medicine in combination with
anticonvulsant medicine.
<P>

22  	He responded to that treatment and on 31 May 1998 told his uncle
that he had killed his mother.  His uncle advised him to speak
to the police
and took him to the police station.  A formal interview took place, during
which these questions and answers were made
-
<P>

Q69	Yeah?
<P>

A	And after all, after all I though, well it wasn't worth her staying around
anyway, so I killed her.
<P>

Q70	How'd you kill her?
<P>

A	With a knife, I got it from the kitchen.
<P>

...
<P>

Q75	Yeah?  And then what happened after, after you, after you, how many, do you
know how many times you stabbed her?
<P>

A	Three.
<P>

...
<P>

Q90	What did you do with the knife?
<P>

A	Left it in mum's hands.
<P>

Q91	You left it in - - -
<P>

A	Because I wanted the police to think she killed herself.
<P>

...
<P>

Q134	Mm.  Did you have a cup of coffee with her?
<P>

A	Mm.
<P>

Q135	Who made the coffee, you or your mum?
<P>

A	Mum.
<P>

...
<P>

Q137	Did you have a, have a cigarette?
<P>

A	I had a cigarette twice.
<P>

Q138	Where'd they, whose cigarettes - - -
<P>

A	One in the lounge room - - -
<P>

Q138	- - - who cigarette, whose cigarettes were they?
<P>

A	Paul's.
<P>

Q139	How did you know they were Paul's?
<P>

	A	He told me.
<P>

Q140	Pardon?
<P>

A	He told me.
<P>

Q141	He told you?  No, who, how'd you know they were Paul's?
<P>

A	He, he told me.
<P>

Q142	Did you know they were Paul's before?
<P>

A	He told me.
<P>

...
<P>

Q185	O.K.  When, when you stabbed your mum, where was she?
<P>

A	On the back couch.
<P>

Q186	On the back couch.  What part, what - - -
<P>

A	It was, it was facing the TV, so it's where her back ..........
<P>

Q187	All right.  She was watching the TV was she.
<P>

A	Yeah.
<P>

...
<P>

Q190	Did you get any garden gloves?
<P>

A	Yeah.  I wore them myself.
<P>

...
<P>

Q203	All right.  So you got the knife out of the kitchen drawer?
<P>

A	Yeah.
<P>

23  	The accused was arrested and kept in the psychiatric wing of the
prison hospital.  He was seen by a number of psychiatrists.
 The first was Dr
Jolly, who first saw him in January 1997.  The accused told Dr Jolly that his
mother had been stabbed in the house
but that he did not even remember that
day, he was afraid to think about it.
<P>

24  	Dr Jolly saw the accused again on 19 November 1998 and during
the interview the accused said -
<P>

Something inside me decided me to kill mum ... I don't know why.
<P>

25  	Dr Westmore saw the accused on 23 April 1999.  The accused told
him that when he returned from overseas he went to see his
mother and she asked
him about where he had been.  Then he said -
<P>

She said she had a tooth removed and I just killed her.
<P>

26  	Asked whether he could give further details he replied -
<P>

Not really, I had voices in my head telling me I was going to save the world if
I killed her, by killing mum I would be saving the
world and that's why I
killed her.
<P>

27  	The accused was seen by Dr Nielssen on behalf of the Crown on 13
July 1999.  When Dr Nielssen asked him what actually happened
he said -
<P>

I think I used a knife.  I put gloves on and stabbed my mother.
<P>

28  	He also told Dr Nielssen that he had taken off the jumper his
mother had given him because it felt dirty.  He said that he
had left his
mother's home, crossed the river and gone through bushland and a golf course
before hailing a taxi to take him to Wollongong.
<P>

29  	The evidence is of three kinds, namely the circumstantial
evidence of what happened soon before and after the deceased was
killed, the
account the accused  gave to the police when formally interviewed and
admissions he has recently made to interviewing
psychiatrists.
<P>

30  	The accused's finger and thumbprints on the coffee cup and
cigarette packet show that he was in the deceased's flat after Mr
Barber left
and before the body of the deceased was found.  The presence of his jumper
shows that he was there when and after the
deceased was stabbed.  The lack of a
struggle, damage and theft speaks against an attack by a stranger.  Even
allowing for the accused's
mental state at the time, his taking a taxi to
Wollongong when he must have known that he had no money to pay for it shows
that he
had an important reason to get away from the vicinity.  I am satisfied
that he knew where his mother lived, whatever he told his
friends in Warrawong,
and that if he had needed shelter he could have gone to her flat.  The reason
why he did not was because he
knew what he had done.
<P>

31  	I am satisfied that he lied when he told his friends that he did
not know where his mother lived.  His presence at the flat
shows that he knew
what he said was not true.  It was a lie about a matter material to the case
and there appears to be no reason
for the lie other than his consciousness of
guilt.
<P>

32  	In my opinion this evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that
the accused stabbed the deceased.  The only inference available
from the nature
of the weapon and the wounds is an intent at least to do really serious bodily
injury.
<P>

33  	Ordinarily, admissions of the kind that I have extracted from
the formal interview between the accused and the police would
have been enough
by themselves to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Those admissions
need to be treated with caution, however,
because the accused still had a
serious mental illness at the time, even though he had responded to
treatment.
<P>

34  	Much of what the accused told the police was incomprehensible
and some clear statements of fact were untrue.  He said that
a friend of his
called Ericson was present.  I find that to be untrue.  He said that he had
raped his mother.  In fact the deceased
was not sexually interfered with at
all, notwithstanding her cries which the neighbours heard.
<P>

35  	Dr Jolly thinks that the accused attended the police station
voluntarily, wanting and needing to get something off his mind.
 In his report
of 28 April 1999 Dr Westmore implicitly accepts as factual at least the central
facts of the killing admitted by the
accused.
<P>

36  	In his report of 22 July 1999 Dr Nielssen states that he does
not believe that the accused has made a false confession.
<P>

37  	In these circumstances, although I would not regard the evidence
of confessions made to the police as independently proving
beyond reasonable
doubt that the accused intentionally killed the deceased, I think that it
strengthens the circumstantial case.
<P>

38  	The final body of evidence is of things the accused told the
interviewing psychiatrists.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> provides that statements reported
in such a way become evidence of the facts.  Counsel did not submit that the
evidence should be
treated on any other basis.  I think that this evidence is
likely to be far more reliable than that coming out of the police interview,
because the accused was on each occasion speaking to a psychiatrist who knew
his history of injury, illness, symptoms and treatment
and requested and
received explanations as a critical expert.  Each of the psychiatrists appears
to accept that what the accused
said, at least about the central facts of his
killing his mother, may be taken at face value.
<P>

39  	I have set out earlier in this judgment the more important parts
of what the accused said.  They are independently capable
of proving beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused stabbed his mother and that in doing so he
intended to kill her.
<P>

40  	I conclude that the accused stabbed the deceased to death with
the knife, intending as he did so to kill her.
<P>

41  	The whole of the psychiatric evidence raises the question
whether the accused ought to be held criminally responsible for his
acts.  If
it appears that he was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for his
actions the Court may return a special verdict
that he is not guilty by reason
of mental illness.
<P>

42  	In fact all three psychiatrists are of the opinion that the
defence is available to the accused.  The Crown has very properly
submitted
that the Court ought to return the special verdict.
<P>

43  	Dr Westmore concludes that the accused suffers and suffered a
psychotic disorder of some severity.  He has auditory hallucinations,
bizarre
thought processes and a history of delusional beliefs.  He has a history of
ideas of reference and a thought content of a
predominantly paranoid nature.
His condition is of several years' standing, although its relationship to the
head injury is uncertain.
 Dr Westmore makes a differential diagnosis of
organic brain disorder characterised by psychotic symptoms or drug induced
state.
<P>

44  	Dr Westmore is of the opinion that at the time of the death of
the deceased the accused was suffering from a psychotic condition,
most
probably a paranoid schizophrenic illness, which may have been aggravated by
substance abuse.  The illness deprived him of a
total sense of the capacity to
understand that he ought not to do the act that he did and that the act was
wrong.
<P>

45  	Commenting on Dr Westmore's report, Dr Jolly agreed with the
findings and concluded that the accused had the defence of mental
illness
available.
<P>

46  	Dr Nielssen had the accused under his care for nearly a year and
it was on his initiative that the accused became a forensic
patient pending
trial, so enabling him to receive treatment.  Dr Nielssen expresses the opinion
that the accused was acutely ill
when he stabbed his mother and has the defence
of mental illness open to him.  He had a defect of reason that his mother was
involved
in some form of spiritual attack that endangered him, and that killing
her would somehow benefit the world.  The defect of reason
arose from a disease
of the mind, which was a severe psychotic illness.  Dr Nielssen concluded by
stating that the accused was almost
certainly aware of the nature and quality
of his acts, but that he was not aware that his actions were wrong in a moral
sense.
<P>

47  	The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an
order that the accused be detained in such place and in such
manner as the
Court thinks fit until released by due process of law.  In practice, that will
mean that the accused will be referred
to the Mental Health Review Tribunal
under the provisions of the Mental Health Act.  The Tribunal will review the
accused's case
and make recommendations to the responsible Minister at
prescribed intervals about the detention, care and treatment of the accused.
In making any such recommendation, the Tribunal will have regard to the safety
of members of the public as well as to the continuing
health and needs of the
accused himself.
<P>

48  	I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness.  I
order that he be detained in a hospital until released by due
process of
law.
<P>

49  	The exhibits may be returned.
