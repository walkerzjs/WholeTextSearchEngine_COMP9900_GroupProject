<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	This is an appeal from a decision of Master Harrison of 14
September 1998 under which, pursuant to SCR Pt20 r4(3), she gave
leave to the
plaintiff to amend the statement of claim by substituting for the five
defendants originally named, new defendants including
the original five and
four more.  It is unfortunate that an appeal on a procedural question, which
was estimated, correctly, to have
a hearing time of two to three hours, should
have had to wait fourteen months before determination with the result that the
action
could make no progress during that time as the parties to it were not
finally ascertained.
<P>

2   	The relevant facts are set out in the Master's judgment.  I
do not intend to repeat them because there is no contention about
them and they
can be read in pages 1 to 6 of her judgment.  In summary, as she explained, the
plaintiff was injured on 23 November
1991, when taking part in the mud jump at
a Galah Day organised by the Nambucca Valley Galah Day Association, at a
property known
as "Willow Bend" owned by Mr and Mrs Van Der Broek, the first
and second defendants.  After making various inquiries and seeking
information
as to the members of the committee, the plaintiff by statement of claim filed
on 16 December 1992: in paragraph 1, sued
the first, second, third, fourth and
fifth defendants as members of the Nambucca Valley Galah Day Committee having
the care, control
and management of the Tenth Anniversary Galah Day activities
and as such joint occupiers of the property; and in paragraph 2, sued
the first
and second defendants as owners of "Willow Bend" and occupiers of the property
and the persons having the care, control
and management of the activities.  In
the defence filed on 16 March 1993, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the statement of
claim were admitted
by all defendants, and the plaintiffs naturally then felt
secure as to their having sued the right people.  Problems arose as a result
of
inquiries made by the insurer and the insurer's subsequent decision to deny
liability to indemnify the defendants, which caused
the defendants to take a
closer interest in the action.  The first, second, fourth and fifth defendants
sought leave to amend the
defence to deny membership of the committee and the
first and second defendants additionally sought leave to amend to deny
occupation
of the subject property, while they admitted they were registered as
proprietors.  Leave to amend was granted by Acting Prothonotary
Irwin on 20 May
1998.  The granting of such leave of course amounted to granting leave to
withdraw an admission.  Amended defences
have now been filed.  In their amended
defence, the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants deny paragraph 1 of the
statement
of claim and the first and second defendants, so far as paragraph 2
is concerned, admit that they are the registered proprietors,
but otherwise
deny occupation.  In a separate defence the third defendant denies paragraph 1.
Paragraph 2 is not pleaded against
him in any event.  There are consequential
amendments to the cross-claim which are in line with the amendments to the
defence, the
original cross-claim having alleged committee membership of the
defendants/cross-claimants.  I should add that the application to
amend the
defence was made by motion filed on 12 September 1997.  The judgment of the
Acting Prothonotary refers to it as being of
the first, second, third and fifth
defendants but that is not correct.  Third was a mistake for fourth.  The file
does not disclose
any application by the third defendant.  Thus it is not clear
on what basis a document called "Defence of the Third Defendant" which
denies
paragraph 1 of the statement of claim was filed on 6 September 1999.
<P>

3   	It seems as a result of these amendments, the plaintiff
applied by motion filed on 20 July 1998 for leave to amend the statement
of
claim pursuant to Pt 20 r4(3) and leave was given by the Master as I have
stated.  An alternative claim to join additional defendants
under Pt 8 r8(1)
was not pursued.  The additional defendants now appeal from that decision of
the Master.  It is not suggested, that
if there were power to grant the
amendment pursuant to the relevant rule, there was any fault in the exercise of
the discretion to
grant leave.  Clearly, if there were a discretion it was
properly exercised.  The question therefore is whether the amendment made
pursuant to the order was an amendment allowed by the relevant rule.
<P>

4   	The relevant rules are as follows:
<P>

<b>PART 20 - Amendment </b>
<P>

<b>4.	Statutes of limitation </b>
<P>

(1)	Where any relevant period of limitation expires after the date of filing of
a statement of claim and after that expiry an application
is made under rule 1
for leave to amend the statement of claim by making the amendment mentioned in
any of subrules (3), (4) and
(5), the Court may in the circumstances mentioned
in that subrule make an order giving leave accordingly, notwithstanding that
that
period has expired. 
<P>

(2)	(Repealed) 
<P>

(3)	Where there has been a mistake in the name of a party and the Court is
satisfied that the mistake was not misleading or such
as to cause reasonable
doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be made a party, the Court
may make an order for leave
to make an amendment to correct the mistake,
whether or not the effect of the amendment is to substitute a new party.
<P>

<b>PART 8 - Causes of Action and Parties</b>
<P>

<b>8.	Addition of parties</b> 
<P>

(1)	Where a person who is not a party: 
<P>

(a)	ought to have been joined as a party; or 
<P>

(b)	is a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all
matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually
and completely
determined and adjudicated upon, 
<P>

the Court, on application by him or by any party or of its own motion, may
order that he be added as a party and make orders for
the further conduct of
the proceedings.
<P>

5   	It is perfectly clear that the intention of the plaintiff
was to sue the members of the committee.  If it is relevant, the
constitution
of the Nambucca Valley Galah Day Association provides that the office bearers
of the Association are to be a president,
a treasurer, a secretary and five
committee members, elected at an annual general meeting to be held each year
between 1 July and
31 October.  The public liability policy named as the
insured "The Nambucca Valley Galah Day Committee".  The appellants who are
the
four new persons named as defendants did not lead any evidence to contradict
the anticipated claim, to be made by amendment,
that they were members of the
relevant committee and thus to show the amendment would be futile.  I should
add that the amendment
made pursuant to the leave granted by Master Harrison
and incorporated in the amended statement of claim filed on 24 September 1998,
makes a change to paragraph 1 of the statement of claim which was not
authorised by the orders made by the Master.  Paragraph 1 of
the original
statement of claim alleged that the defendants were "members of the Nambucca
Valley Galah Day Committee" and paragraph
1 of the amended statement of claim
alleges that the defendants were members of "an organising committee for the
Nambucca Valley
Tenth Anniversary Galah Day", which is not necessarily the
same.  Whether anything would turn on this is not a matter with which
I am
dealing, nor is the other amendment to paragraph 1 which is no doubt
consequential but was not sought.  The question to be addressed
is whether the
amendment allowed is an amendment to correct a mistake in the name of a party,
rather than an amendment adding as
parties, persons who ought to have been
joined.
<P>

6   	It is not at all clear from the evidence before the Master
and thus before me who were the committee members on the date in
question.
Nevertheless, there was evidence which might go to establish that the
additional named defendants were members of that
committee.  As the Master
realised the question really was whether the plaintiff had established facts
which brought the application
within the principles enunciated in
<b><cite>Bridge Shipping Pty Ltd v Grand Shipping South Australia</cite></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20173%20CLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 173 CLR 231.</a>  In that case an application for amendment failed because
the defendant had intended to cross-claim against the owner of a ship,
whereas
later it was discovered that the ship had been chartered to another party who
would have been the appropriate cross-defendant.
 The intention had been to sue
the owner and therefore it was held there was no mistake in the name of a
party, but rather a mistake
in the party sued.  The learned Master in her
judgment considered the relevant passages in <b><cite>Bridge
Shipping</cite></b> and in particular she referred to the judgment of McHugh J
and his apparent acceptance of the following passage in the judgment of
Donaldson LJ in <b><cite>Evans Constructions Co Limited v Charrington &amp; Co
Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20QB%20810" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] QB 810</a> at page 821, dealing with a similar English
rule:
<P>

In applying Ord. 20, r. 5(3) it is, in my judgment, important to bear in mind
that there is a real distinction between suing A in
the mistaken belief that A
is the party who is responsible for the matters complained of and seeking to
sue B, but mistakenly describing
or naming him as A and thereby ending up suing
A instead of B.  The rule is designed to correct the latter and not the former
category
of mistake.  Which category is involved in any particular case depends
upon the intentions of the person making the mistake and they
have to be
determined on the evidence in the light of all the surrounding
circumstances.
<P>

7   	<b><cite>Bridge</cite></b> was dealing with Order 36 of the
Victorian Supreme Court Rules, the relevant rules, namely 36.01(4)(5) and (6),
being similar to
the New South Wales Pt20 r4(3), the English Order 20 r5(3) and
the Queensland Order 32 r(1)(2) and (3).  The wording in each set
of rules is
different and needs to be considered together with any rules as to addition of
parties, but the principles set out in
<b><cite>Bridge</cite></b> are clearly
applicable to the New South Wales rules and it was not argued otherwise.  All
parties on the appeal and before the Master
relied upon the following paragraph
from the judgment of McHugh J at p259:
<P>

The concluding words of sub-r. (4) "whether or not the effect is to
substitute another person as a party" enable a plaintiff to
substitute one
person for another person as a party to the action. Those words also imply that
the fact that the plaintiff intended
to sue the person who was sued does not
prevent the sub-rule applying provided that there was a mistake in the name of
the person
sued. Moreover, a plaintiff may make "a mistake in the name of a
party" not only because the plaintiff mistakenly believes that a
certain
person, whom the plaintiff can otherwise identify, bears a certain name but
also because the plaintiff mistakenly believes
that a person who answers a
particular description bears a certain name. Thus, a plaintiff may make a
mistake "in the name of a party"
because, although intending to sue a
particular person whom the plaintiff knows by sight, the plaintiff is mistaken
as to that person's
name. Equally, the plaintiff may make a mistake "in the
name of a party" because, although intending to sue a person whom the plaintiff
knows by a particular description, eg the driver of a certain car, the
plaintiff is mistaken as to the name of the person who answers
that
description. In both cases, the plaintiff knows the person intended to be sued
by reference to some property or properties which
is or are peculiar to that
person but is mistaken as to the name of that person. In the first case, the
properties which identify
the person are personal characteristics; in the
second case, they are the properties which are of the essence of the
description
of that person. But for the purpose of sub-r. (4) that distinction
is irrelevant. In both cases, the plaintiff was mistaken only
as to the name of
the person intended to be sued. There is no warrant for treating sub-r. (4) as
dealing only with the case where
the properties which identify the party are
inherent properties. That is, there is no warrant for treating sub-r. (4) as
dealing
only with the case where the plaintiff says: "The person I wish to
substitute as a party is that entity which I identified by certain
inherent
properties peculiar to it but whose name I mistakenly believed was X" The
sub-rule applies equally to the case where the
plaintiff says: "The person I
wish to substitute as a party is that entity which I identified by reference to
certain properties
which are true of it and of no one else and whose name I
mistakenly believed was X" In both cases, a mistake in the name of the party
has occurred and can be seen to have occurred only because the person sued does
not have or is not identified by some property or
properties which is or are
peculiar to the person intended to be sued and to no one else.
<P>

8   	In her judgment the learned Master made mention of
<b><cite>Fernance v The Nominal Defendant</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 710</a>, which
was apparently relied upon by the present appellants before her.  She held,
correctly in my view, that <b><cite>Bridge</cite></b> governed the application
and <b><cite>Fernance</cite></b> was directed towards a different question.
Nevertheless it is important to bear in mind the provisions of Pt 8 r8 when
considering
the framework in which Pt 20 r4 operates.  An explanation, so far
as the English rule is concerned, is found in <b><cite>Mitchell v Harris
Engineering Company Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%202%20QB%20703" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 2 QB 703.</a>  The reasoning of the
Master for her decision is found in the following passage commencing on page 12
of her judgment:
<P>

The issue for determination before me is to characterise the mistake which the
plaintiff claims to have made and ascertain whether
it meets the requirements
of Pt20 r4(3). The plaintiff concedes that the defendants' statements and
affidavits contain inconsistent
information and are voluminous. The plaintiff
submitted that they refer to the identities of persons who make up a core group
of
people who were the organisers and had the care, management, control of the
Galah Day. It was this group of people that the plaintiff
has always intended
to name as defendants. The newly named defendants submitted that the plaintiff
did not make a mistake but gave
the wrong appellation. They made a mistake by
not including all the defendants they should have and now seek to add
defendants so
cannot rely on Pt20 r4(3). They can only make application under
Pt8 r8.
<P>

From the plaintiff's solicitor's letter of 19 November 1992 addressed to Mr and
Mrs Van Den Broek and Curwood and Partners letter
to the plaintiff's solicitors
dated 16 December 1992 it is my view that the plaintiff did intend to name the
individuals who answered
a particular description. That particular description
can be defined as the members of the Tenth Anniversary Nambucca Valley Galah
Day Committee who had the care, control and management of activities. The
plaintiff made enquiries as to whether he had correctly
identified the members
of the Committee. Even though the plaintiff commenced paragraph 1 of the
statement of claim naming individuals
as the first, second, third, fourth and
fifth defendants it then refers to them as being members of the Nambucca Valley
Galah Day
Committee who had the care, control and management of the Tenth
Annual Galah Day. The plaintiff had (on the advice of the defendant)
concluded
that he had named all the members of the Nambucca Valley Galah Day Committee.
This turned out to be a mistake.
<P>

Pt20 r4(3) should be interpreted beneficially. The mistake that was made was
that all individual members who met that description
were not included as
defendants in these proceedings. By substituting the individuals who meet the
description of members of the
Nambucca Valley Galah Day Committee who had care,
control and management of the Tenth Anniversary Galah Day activities, the
plaintiff
does not intend to sue a different organisation. Reference in
paragraph 1 of the statement of claim to the first, second, third,
fourth and
fifth defendants as being members of the Committee who had the care, control
and management of the Tenth Anniversary Galah
Day was not misleading nor did it
cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the persons intended to be made a
party. I respectfully
adopt McInerney J's interpretation of Pt20 r4(3). The
role of construction is that the singular includes the plural (see s8(b) of
the
Interpretation Act 1986). The rule contemplates the substitution of more than
one party if they answer a particular description.
<P>

9   	There is no doubt that the plaintiff intended to sue
persons who were members of the Nambucca Valley Galah Day Committee, namely
persons who fell within that particular description.  On the other hand, the
action would not fail if all persons who were members
of the committee were not
joined as defendants.  An organisation is not the defendant.  It is easy enough
to make a mistake in the
name of an employer or a landlord but it is difficult
to see how a mistake in number can amount to a mistake in name.  In fact the
evidence upon which the application for amendment was made did not establish
with any certainty that the nine persons now sought
to be substituted as
defendants were members of the committee or the only members of the committee.
The difficulty for the plaintiff
in the application before the Master and for
that matter on this appeal, is that it has not been shown that there was any
mistake
in joinder of the original defendants.  The plaintiff is still claiming
that those defendants were members of the relevant committee.
 In other words,
each answered a particular description as a member of the committee, but now it
is alleged that other people answered
that description as well.  McInerney J
pointed out in <b><cite>Greentree v G.D. Searle &amp; Company</cite></b>
(unreported 31 July 1992) that there is no reason why more than one party
cannot be substituted for the one party originally named.
 He went on to say,
however, when dealing with the question of substitution of parties, rather than
adding parties:- 
<P>

adding of parties normally includes the leaving of the original party in the
action.  In this case this is clearly a substitution
of three parties for one
party.
<P>

10   	In <b><cite>Greentree</cite></b> the original defendant
did not remain a party but three new defendants were named in substitution for
the original defendant.  The
words quoted in the preceding paragraph accord
with the  decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in <b><cite>Hayward v
Darling Downs Aircraft Services Pty Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%202%20QdR%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 2 QdR 153</a>, which held
that the equivalent Queensland rule did not authorise addition of parties
rather than substitution.  A passage from the
judgment of Toohey J in
<b><cite>Bridge</cite></b> at page 250 might give the impression that in
<b><cite>Evans Constructions</cite></b> an order was made adding an additional
defendant under the equivalent English rule.  That did not happen.  Such an
order was made
by the County Court Judge but this was corrected on appeal.  In
the present case there is no mistake in the names of the original
five
defendants and it is intended to leave them in, claiming that they were members
of the committee.  What the amendment seeks
is to add four other persons whom
it is also sought to say were members of the committee.  In other words it is
alleged in the amended
claim, albeit not in appropriate words in accordance
with the leave, that all nine defendants were members of the committee.  It
is
not alleged that they were the only members of the committee or <u>the</u>
members of the committee but "members of the committee".  The defendants were
separately named and separately numbered.  I do not
understand that a defendant
A can be substituted for the same person A.  In fact leaving the original
defendants in makes it impossible
to say there has been a mistake in name.  The
amendment does not fall within the categories of mistake to which McHugh J held
the
rule extended.
<P>

11   	This seems a hard case but limitation cases often are and
Limitation Acts have a proper purpose.  I have come to the conclusion
that what
was sought by the amendment was the addition of parties not the substitution of
parties.  In those circumstances I have
concluded that the Master's decision
was in error and the appeals should be allowed.
<P>
