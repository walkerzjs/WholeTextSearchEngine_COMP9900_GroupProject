<P>

<i>(Plaintiff)</i>
<P>

<b>v</b>
<P>

<b>CHRISTOPHER HARTCHER</b>
<P>

<i>(Defendant)</i></center>
<P>


<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Transfer to District Court)</b>
<P>

1   	The defendant applies for an order pursuant to s 143 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act 1973</a></i> that this defamation action be transferred to
that Court in Sydney.  The application is opposed.  
<P>

2   	The defendant moves by Notice of Motion filed in Court on
27 August and the affidavit in support sworn 27 July of Simon William
Davis
solicitor for Mr Hartcher.
<P>

3   	The lamentable history of the conduct of this litigation
and the extraordinary nature of it is eloquently set out in the judgment
of
Simpson J of 2 June 1999 (NSWSC 527) wherein she dismissed a Notice of Motion
on the part of the defendant to have the action
stayed or dismissed for want of
prosecution.
<P>

4   	Apparently there is now anxiety in the defendant to have
this matter disposed of;  hence the present application. 
<P>

5   	The conduct of both the plaintiff and the defendant
received appropriate critical comment from her Honour.  It appears from
the
affidavit of Mr Davis that the plaintiff has failed to comply with Orders and
Directions of this Court particularly in relation
to the filing of a Reply.  It
is to be noted that one in fact was filed on 30 July 1999.
<P>

6   	As I understand it there has been an exchange of
correspondence between the solicitors for the parties relating to the
plaintiff's
intention to amend the imputations, that is, the causes of action,
upon which he will rely against the defendant.  
<P>

7   	In the event the present imputations are:
<P>

<i>"5(a)	The plaintiff made allegations against the NSW National Parks and
Wildlife Service which he knew to be false;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the plaintiff made allegations against the NSW National Parks and
Wildlife Service of so ridiculous a nature that he ought to
have known they
were false;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The plaintiff irresponsibly made a series of allegations against the NSW
National Parks and Wildlife Service for the purpose of
gaining publicity for
himself;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	The plaintiff had caused the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to
expend considerable time and money by making a series
of allegations against it
which he knew to be false;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	The plaintiff had caused the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to
expend considerable time and money be making a series
of allegations against it
which were so ridiculous that he ought to have known that they were
false".</i>
<P>

8   	The defendant proposes amongst other defences to justify
and one can gather from the present application, he is anxious to
do so.  The
imputations while serious are not of the upmost gravity.  The quantum of
damages the plaintiff is likely to obtain, on
any view of the matter, will be
severely affected by the admission into evidence of certificates of his
conviction for perjury. 
Even leaving that to one side the plaintiff's quantum
of damages severely will be affected, absent any acceptable explanation on
the
issue, by the delay in the initiation of the proceedings and in their
prosecution.  I mention these matters by reason of certain
submissions made in
the course of argument as to the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act
1973</a></i> and in particular, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(1)(e).</a>
<P>

9   	Relevantly that section is now in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"44(1)	Subject to this Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose
of the following actions:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	any action of a kind:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	which, if brought in the Supreme Court, would be assigned to the Common
Law Division of that Court, and</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	in which the amount claimed does not exceed $750,000, whether on a
balance of account or after an admitted set-off or otherwise,
other than an
action referred to in paragraph (d) or (e),</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	(Repealed)</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	any action brought to recover an amount not exceeding $20,000, which is
the whole or part of the unliquidated balance of a partnership
account, or the
amount or part of the amount of the distributive share under an intestacy or of
a legacy under a will,</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	any motor accident claim , irrespective of the amount claimed,</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	any proceedings transferred to the Court under section 143 (1),
irrespective of the amount (if any) claimed in those proceedings".</i>
<P>

10   	The amendments to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act</a></i> giving
rise to the new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(1)</a> came into effect on 2 February 1998.  It was submitted
for the defendant that there has developed a misconception in relation to
the
transfer of defamation actions to the District Court to the extent that there
is a belief held that the jurisdiction of that
Court is limited to $750,000.
It is argued that the proper construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(1)(e)</a> leads to the conclusion
that the jurisdiction of the District Court is <i>"unlimited</i>" in relation
to an action transferred under s 143(1) of that legislation.  This is an
interesting question that to some extent was
considered by Sperling J in
<b><i>Moira Cremona v Joseph Ho Shon</i></b> (unreported, 21 August 1998).  His
Honour was there dealing with an action for personal injury though the nature
of that action is
not disclosed by his Honour's judgment.  His Honour merely
made a declaration that in relation to the action with which he was concerned
the District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(1)(e)</a> in the context of
the defendant having failed to consent to unlimited jurisdiction in the
District Court in that personal injuries
case.  Arguably by implication it
could be said that an action transferred under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(1)(e)</a> from the Common Law
Division to the District Court being an action for defamation is not subject to
any statutory limitation in the
District Court as to a jurisdictional limit
(namely, $750,000).  This is a nice point which it is not necessary for me to
decide
as viewing the whole of this action and the material referred to in the
affidavit in support of the application, on no rational basis
could one see
this plaintiff being awarded let alone being awarded a sustainable verdict
anywhere near the verdict of $750,000. 
If consequent upon any order for
transfer to the District Court a verdict in the plaintiff's favour in a sum in
excess of $750,000
is ordered, subject to any prior to decision of this Court
on a case more pertinent to the issue, the question of his right to retain
it
would no doubt be the subject of determination.
<P>

11   	It is argued by the plaintiff that he would be deprived of
the right to trial by jury.  That is not so.  In the Supreme Court
he has a
right automatically.  In the District Court he may apply for a trial by jury
and I am not persuaded in this case that the
mere fact that he might have to
apply for one and subject himself to any discretionary considerations to be
applied by the District
Court judge is sufficient basis for not otherwise
transferring the matter to the District Court.
<P>

12   	It has to be observed now that the observations of Hunt J
in <b><i>Brown v Mirror Newspapers Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20NSWLR%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 2 NSWLR 80</a> are no
longer of continuing relevance.  There exists in the District Court a mechanism
akin to the Defamation List established in
this Court and thus any notion of
"<i>expertise</i>" said to be exclusively within the province of the Supreme
Court is unable vis-a-vis the District Court.
<P>

13   	There is nothing in relation to the status of the parties,
in my view, that precludes transfer to the District Court.  I am
not suggesting
that the status of the parties is conclusive as to retention or determinative
of transfer in some invidious distinction
drawing way (see my remarks in
<b><i>Ieremia v Skalkos &amp; Anor</i></b> (unreported, 19 March 1999 (NSWSC
315).  At the time of the publication complained of the defendant was a
Minister for the Crown
who issued a press release.  I do not think that is a
relevant consideration in the whole context of this case (intending no
disparagement
of the defendant who presently still is a Member of the New South
Wales Parliament in Opposition).
<P>

14   	It is argued for the defendant that the action will be
listed for hearing far more quickly in the District Court than in the
Supreme
Court.  This is a delicate proposition:  it has to be acknowledged that the
District Court is enjoying remarkable success
in the disposition of its Civil
Lists.  The use of arguments about long matters callovers and deferring of
hearings in the Supreme
Court to say, 2001 if there is further delay may not be
of continuing validity.
<P>

15   	This is not in my respectful view a major defamation
action:  time and costs will be saved by its immediate transfer to the
District
Court.  The saving will be greater of course if the plaintiff and the defendant
both diligently prosecute the action on
the one hand and the defence on the
other.  If there is seriously to be an argument about imputations that can be
dealt with in the
District Court.
<P>

16   	This particular application does not lend itself to the
exposition of a set of principles or guidelines to operate in connection
with
the transfer of defamation actions to the District Court.  Defamation actions
may range from mass media communications involving
citizens of high prominence
on the one hand and what are referred to as "<i>backyarders</i>" on the other.
Each action of course is important to each litigant.  The quantification of
damages is in a state of flux as-it-were
in terms of actions commenced after 1
January 1995 in relation to publications after that date wherein damages lie in
the hands of
judges.  I know of no case in the Supreme Court in which a judge
who has enjoyed the benefit of the smooth conduct of the post-1995
case to the
point of trial has awarded any sum approaching the assumed jurisdictional limit
of the District Court of $750,000.
<P>

17   	I add that I do not see anything in this litigation as
exposed by the pleadings as indicating any major matter of principle
that would
warrant the consideration of this Court.
<P>

18   	I order that the action be transferred to the District
Court at Sydney.  The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs of
the
application heard on 27 August 1999.
