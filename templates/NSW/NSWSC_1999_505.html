<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 17 October 1997 I gave leave to the
defendants to file a Second Further Amended Defence in accordance with a draft
then initialled
by me and placed with the papers.  Such pleading was not filed
until 15 January 1998 and when filed it contained a number of additional
matters not in the draft, being variations of the defences of qualified
privilege and comment said to be appropriate to the different
legislation
applicable in other states and territories relevant to such defences - these
amendments may conveniently be referred
to as the "interstate defences".
<P>

2   	By letter dated 18 February 1998, the plaintiff's
solicitors objected to inclusion of these interstate defences in the Amended
Defence on the ground (which was in fact the case) that they had not been
included in the draft initialled by me on 17 October 1997.
 A number of letters
followed until by letter dated 25 March 1998 the defendants' solicitor
wrote:
<P>

"Please advise whether your client is relying on publication in New South Wales
alone and relying on publication in all other States
and Territories as going
only to damages (<u>Toomey</u> -v- <u>John Fairfax</u>).
<P>

If so, then the interstate defences are not required to be pleaded in my
client's second Further Amended Defence.
<P>

If not, then your client will be relying on publication in each and every State
and Territory and the interstate defences are required
to be pleaded in my
client's Second Further Amended Defence."
<P>

3   	By letter dated 1 May 1998 the plaintiff's solicitors
replied:
<P>

"Our client is relying on publication in other states and territories as going
only to damages.  Accordingly, the interstate defences
should not be pleaded in
your clients' Second Further Amended Defence.
<P>

Please arrange for the filing and serving of a Second Further Amended Defence
in the form handed up to his Honour Justice Dunford
on 15 October 1997."
<P>

4   	Then by Notice of Motion filed 25 September 1998, the
defendants sought the following orders:
<P>

"1.	Pursuant to Part 12 Supreme Court Rules, the following questions of law be
removed to the Court of Appeal for consideration:
<P>

(a)	Whether, expressly pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.116</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, or pursuant to
any freedom of speech implied into the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, there is a defence to a
cause of action in defamation arising from any right to freedom of speech
concerning religious issues.
<P>

(b)	If so, whether this freedom of speech defence is analogous to the implied
Constitutional right of freedom of speech concerning
political matter, or
whether it constitutes grounds for striking out an action entirely, as occurred
in <i>Ballina Shire Council v. Ringland </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 680</a> or is otherwise
subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.116</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

(c)	Whether, in circumstances where the head of a religious organisation who is
not otherwise named claims to be identified by a
reference to that
organisation, the Courts will permit an action to be brought by an individual
claiming to be identified by a reference
to a Church (e.g. the Roman Catholic
Church), or whether any such action is similarly liable to be struck out.
<P>

(d)	In the event of different concepts of freedom of speech applying to
Territories, the proper method of assessment of damages
for publications in
more than one State or territory of Australia.
<P>

2.	Such further directions as this Honourable Court may deem necessary,
including the staying of these proceedings pending the hearing
of this
application.
<P>

3.	Costs to be costs in the cause,"
<P>

and by affidavit of their solicitor sworn the same day annexed a copy of a
proposed Further Amended Defence which the defendants
sought leave to file.
<P>

5   	That proposed Defence sought to add to the defences of
qualified privilege that the matters were published "pursuant to an
implied or
express right of freedom of speech concerning religious matters," and the
interstate defences were repeated and varied
to include references to a right
of freedom of speech concerning religious matters.
<P>

6   	As it was indicated that a question involving the
interpretation of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> </i></b>was involved, notice was given
to Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and each of the states, but none of
them wished to intervene
"at this stage".
<P>

7   	The proceedings concern publications between March 1991 and
May 1992.  The Statement of Claim was filed on 7 August 1992; and
accordingly s
7A <b><i>Defamation Act</i></b> <b>1974 </b>does not apply and the whole of the
proceedings are to be tried by the jury:  <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>,
</i></b>s 88(b).
<P>

8   	Since the proceedings commenced there have been
considerable delays, some of which are set out in my judgment of 23 April 1997.
Since then, there have been further delays, the parties have been to the Court
of Appeal re contempt of court proceedings, see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 22</a>, and when
the matter was called up in the Holding List on 23 October 1998 with the
possibility of getting a hearing date, it was
on the application of the
plaintiff, stood over to the next call up because of the unavailability of his
senior counsel.  I accept
that it was not realised at the time that there is
generally only one call up of matters in the Long Matters List (as this is) per
year, and the consequence is that, if the Long Matters List is maintained in
its present form, the matter is unlikely to be heard
before February 2000.
<P>

9   	The general rule is that amendments of pleadings should be
allowed so that a defendant is not shut out of raising an arguable
defence thus
precluding the determination of an issue between the parties:  <b><i>Queensland
v JL Holdings Pty Limted </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146</a> at 155.  This principle
applies in defamation cases, even at a late stage in the proceedings:
<b><i>Antoniadis v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 682</a> at
690-695<b><i>.</i></b>
<P>

10   	However, an amendment will not be allowed if it is bad in
law or has no prospect of success and would be struck out if it
appeared in an
original pleading:  <b><i>Horton v Jones (no 2) </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1939/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] NSWStRp 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2039%20SR%28NSW%29%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 39 SR(NSW) 305</a>
at 309-10, <b><i>Heath v Goodwin</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%208%20NSWLR%20478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 8 NSWLR 478</a> at 482, <b><i>Cadam
v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%201%20QB%20413" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] 1 QB 413</a> at 425.  The test is
similar to that applied in <b><i>General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner
for Railways (NSW) </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125.</a> 
<P>

11   	It has been submitted that the question of whether there
is a right of freedom of discussion of religious matters implied
as a result of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 116</a> <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> is a matter of such importance and complexity
that I should at this stage of the proceedings refer it to the Court of Appeal
for
determination.
<P>

12   	I do not agree.  I do not see it as matter of great
complexity and, in view of the delays which have already occurred in the
matter, I consider it desirable that nothing be done to further delay the
proceedings coming on for trial before the jury.  Of course,
whichever party is
dissatisfied with my determination on the issue will have the right, subject to
the leave of the Court of Appeal,
to appeal to that Court against my
interlocutory ruling or as of right at the end of the trial if the issue is
relevant to the final
determination of the case.
<P>

13   	In support of her submission that the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 116</a> implies a right of freedom of discussion of
religious matters, so as to give rise to a defence of qualified privilege, the
defendants'
counsel relied primarily on the joint judgment of the High Court in
<b><i>Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR
520.</a>
<P>

14   	In that judgment the Court, after referring to its
previous decisions in <b><i>Theophanous v Herald and Weekly Times Limited
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20182%20CLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 182 CLR 104</a> and <b><i>Stephens v West Australian Newspapers
Limited </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20182%20CLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 182 CLR 211</a>, considered a number of sections of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> especially <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">13</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">24</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">25</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">28</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">62</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">64</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s83.html" class="autolink_findacts">83</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">128</a>
and held that the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> established a system of
representative and responsible government, that freedom of communication on
matters of government and politics
is an indispensable incident to that system
of government, and accordingly the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> necessarily
protects freedom of communication between citizens concerning political or
governmental matters so that they are able
to exercise a free and informed
choice as electors; but such freedom of communication is not absolute and is
limited to what is necessary
for the effective operation of that system of
representative and responsible government provided for by the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>,</i></b> and the interest which each member of the
Australian community has in such discussion extends the categories of qualified
privilege.
<P>

15   	That is, the extension of the categories of qualified
privilege to accommodate freedom of communication on matters of government
and
politics is implied because the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> expressly provides
for a system of representative and responsible government.  Unlike the position
in the United States, there is
no general constitutional right to freedom of
speech: <b><i>Lange</i></b> at 567.
<P>

16   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 116</a> is as follows:
<P>

"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for
imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting
the free exercise of any
religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any
office or public trust under
the Commonwealth."
<P>

Unlike the sections referred to in <b><i>Lange</i></b> it has nothing to do
with the essential nature of the federal polity or system of government, but it
is a provision imposing restrictions
on Commonwealth legislative power:
<b><i>Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v The Commonwealth
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1943] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2067%20CLR%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 67 CLR 116</a> at 122-3 per Latham CJ.  Those restrictions have the
effect of making religion, religious observance and religious tests irrelevant
to the structure or conduct of the federal government or appointment to federal
office.
<P>

17   	The section effectively excludes religion from the system
of government established by the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> and is, in this
sense, the antithesis of those provisions establishing a system of
representative and responsible government, it
establishes nothing and prohibits
the establishment of anything involving the federal government based on
religion.  The <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> does not establish, and the
Parliament cannot establish, as part of the system of federal government (or at
all) any form of religious
community.
<P>

18   	Accordingly, the principles enunciated in <b><i>Lange's
case</i></b> have no application to the discussion of religious matters or
religious organisations or, to use a phrase taken from the judgment
of Mason P
in the Court of Appeal (at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=42%20NSWLR%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">42 NSWLR 22</a> at 26) and used by him to describe the
issues in this case, "church politics".  There is no need for discussion of
religious matters
to give effect to the system of government established by the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a></i></b> and therefore no constitutional guarantees of
freedom of discussion or communication in relation to such matters.
<P>

19   	For these reasons I am satisfied that it would be futile
to allow the amendments which seek to rely on an alleged right of
freedom of
discussion of religious matters, and to that extent the application to further
amend the Defence is dismissed.
<P>

20   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that a further
reason for disallowing such amendments was that no affidavit had
been sworn
explaining the delay in seeking the amendments and / or deposing to facts
indicating a prima facie case to justify the
matters alleged.  I do not decide
the issue on this ground but for the reasons given above.
<P>

21   	As to the so-called interstate defences, as the
plaintiff's solicitors have said in their letter of 1 May 1998 (quoted above)
that the interstate publications are relied on only as going to damages and not
as separate causes of actions and as it is not necessary
to plead matters going
only to damages, a position conceded in the defendants' solicitor's letter of
25 March 1998, I can see no
reason why the interstate defences should be
included, and the Amended Defence should therefore be in accordance with the
draft initialled
by me on 17 October 1997.
<P>

22   	The Notice of Motion seeks orders pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part 12</a>
that specified questions of law be removed into the Court of Appeal "for
consideration".  However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part 12</a> only authorises the removal into the Court of
Appeal of the entire proceedings: <b><i>Sivakumar v Pattison </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20NSWLR%2078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 2
NSWLR 78</a>, and the appropriate procedure appears to be to identify particular
questions of law for separate determination under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> and then, if
appropriate, order the removal of the whole of the proceedings to the Court of
Appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Part 12.</a>  Before proceedings are removed into the Court of Appeal,
special circumstances must exist which render that course desirable:
<b><i>Sivakumar v Pattison </i></b>at 84.
<P>

23   	In view of my rulings on the application to amend,
questions (a) and (b) are no longer relevant.
<P>

24   	As to question (c) namely, whether the head of a religious
organisation who is not otherwise named but who claims to be identified
by
reference to that organisation can maintain defamation proceedings, the
question of proceedings being brought by a person who
is not personally named
is not new and has been considered in many cases; see <b><u>Gately on Libel and
Slander</u></b>, 7th ed, ch 8, paras 281-294, and the issue of identification
of the plaintiff is ultimately a question for the jury.
<P>

25   	In the present case, this issue has already been dealt
with in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL on 20 October 1995 when his Honour
described the defendants' objections including one that the plaintiff was not
named in the relevant article as "nitpicking", and
subsequently the defendants
sought and obtained an order for further discovery relating to this very issue
of identification of the
plaintiff: see my judgment of 23 April 1997 at pp 4-5.
No application has been made for a separate trial on the ground that the matter
was incapable of being defamatory of the plaintiff and Hunt CJ at CL said such
an argument "would be highly unlikely to succeed"
(p 3).  I see no reason why
the defendants should "side-track" the proceedings at this stage so as to have
this issue ventilated
once again either in the Court of Appeal or elsewhere.
If the plaintiff succeeds in relation to this issue the defendants will have
all their ordinary rights of appeal in respect of this or any other issue of
law involved in the proceedings.
<P>

26   	Question (d) sought to be referred to the Court of Appeal
is said to involve whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 116</a> applies to the territories, and if so whether
that affects the parties' rights in respect of publication in such territories,
and
<b><i>Kruger v Commonwealth of Australia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20146%20ALR%20126" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 146 ALR 126</a> was
referred to.  As I have held that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 116</a> has no application to the law of
defamation in the states where it certainly does apply, this question is no
longer relevant.
<P>

27   	As to the question of the proper method of assessment of
damages in cases involving publication in a number of states and
/ or
territories, where the separate publications are not pleaded as separate causes
of action but only relied on as going to damages,
I was referred to
<b><i>Toomey v Mirror Newspapers Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 173</a> and
<b><i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Waterhouse </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR
519</a>, but it was submitted that these cases were inconsistent with the later
decision of the Full Federal Court in <b><i>David Syme and Co Ltd v
Grey</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/479.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 479</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20115%20ALR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 115 ALR 247</a>, and that this question of assessment of
damages in "multi-state defamations" should also be considered by the Court of
Appeal at
this stage, ie before the trial.  I am not sure that in a case such
as the present there is such inconsistency, but in any event
it is not a matter
which calls for removal into the Court of Appeal at this stage.  If the
defendants succeed on their defences,
the assessment of damages will never
arise so consideration of questions relating to such assessment may turn out to
be academic.
 I can see no valid reason for referring to the Court of Appeal at
this stage any questions which may ultimately turn out to be academic.
 
<P>

28   	This case has now been pending for over seven years
without going to trial and therefore without any determination of any
issues of
fact.  During that time there have been, and by this application continue to
be, numerous interlocutory applications, most
of which it is claimed would
clarify the issues at the trial and make its conduct more manageable.  Whether
that claim is justified
may be open to some doubt, but in any event it seems to
me that the stage has been reached where the proceedings should go to trial
and
the findings of the jury ascertained on the relevant issues of fact.  Any
matters of law which are relevant can then be taken
to the Court of Appeal if
either side is dissatisfied with any of the findings or rulings.  
<P>

29   	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1.	Application to file Third Amended Defence in accordance with draft thereof
annexed to affidavit of Vasilios Kalantzis sworn 25
September 1998
dismissed.
<P>

2.	Extend time for filing Second Further Amended Defence in accordance with
draft thereof initialled by me on 17 October 1997 to
Friday 11 June 1999.
<P>

3.	Extend time for filing any further Reply to such document to Friday 25 June
1999.
<P>

4.	Notice of Motion filed 25 September 1998 dismissed.
<P>

5.	Defendants to pay plaintiff's costs of the applications.
