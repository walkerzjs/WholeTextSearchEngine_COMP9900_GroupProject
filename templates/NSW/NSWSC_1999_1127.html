<b>  Voyager/Melbourne collision)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 14 August
1997 seeks an extension of time within which to commence proceedings pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 (NSW) (the Act).  The
plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 23 November 1998.  The defendant did
not rely on any affidavit
evidence.  The defendant opposes the orders sought.

<P>

2  	I observed the plaintiff carefully when he gave evidence and was
cross-examined.  I formed the opinion that he was quietly spoken.
 I found some
of his evidence (which I will refer to later in this judgment) troubling.  
<P>

3  	For the purposes of this application I find the following
facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 5 February 1946 and is now 53 years of age.  He
resides in Newcastle.
<P>

(2)	On 10 March 1963 the plaintiff became a member of the Royal Australia Navy
when he was accepted for enlistment as a recruit.
 He was then aged 17 years.
The plaintiff enlisted for an initial period of 12 years.  He intended to make
the Navy his career for
30 years.  
<P>

(3)	On 10 February 1964 at approximately 2056 hours Eastern Standard time a
collision occurred between the aircraft carrier HMAS
Melbourne and the
destroyer Voyager at sea about 20 miles south east of Jervis Bay.  Eighty two
men from the Voyager lost their lives
in the collision.  The plaintiff was a
crew member of the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne (the Melbourne) as a flight
deck handler.
<P>

(4)	On the night of the collision the plaintiff was on flight deck duties in
"Fly 1" (starboard for'ard side) sitting on a safety
net.  He was on the outer
edge of the 3rd panel of the net.  The safety net was about 15 feet from the
bow.  He heard an alarm and
felt a violent impact and then there was a loud
noise with debris flying everywhere.  He felt something hit him in the back,
and
then, what he now believes to be the Voyager mast tore the safety netting
away.  He was jolted back and forth, he hit something and
fell into the sea. He
went under water.  The plaintiff was terrified and panicked but he managed to
thrash his way to the surface.
 He found himself struggling to stay on the
surface trapped between two large walls being the sides of the vessels.  He
clung onto
some debris which was smooth, and he was unable to climb onto it.
As he was clinging onto the debris the walls of the two ships seemed
to be
coming together and he was terrified of being crushed.  The plaintiff
remembered swimming towards scramble nets which were
over the side of the
Melbourne.  He grabbed at the scramble net and climbed up the net with
survivors from the Voyager.  He was exhausted
and coughing up water and oil.
After a period time he went up to the flight deck to his post.  He was
completely disorientated and
shocked.  The plaintiff spoke to his Petty Officer
who said "where the fuck have you been".  The plaintiff relied that he had been
in the water and the Petty Officer told him not to tell anyone "or you'll be
charged with desertion or leaving your post".  He was
then told to get changed
and go back to work which he did.  He knew that some of his friends has been
killed in the collision.  
<P>

This version of the incident is at odds with that described in the
questionnaire completed by the plaintiff about two weeks after
the collision.
In this form he stated that at the time of the collision he was not on duty but
reading a paper on 2N (November) Mess.
 He said that the role he played in the
rescue operation was that he went to his emergency station of the flight deck
and helped
to carry stretchers (Ex 4).  He conceded in cross examination that
one of these versions was false.  The plaintiff's explanation
was that the
answers in the questionnaire were false because he was warned that if he told
anyone he had seen the collision he would
be charged with either dereliction of
duty or desertion.  The version in his affidavit refers to a Petty Officer
telling him not
to tell anyone what had happened.  For the purposes of this
application I am willing to accept the plaintiff's explanation for the
two
inconsistent versions and that the version in his affidavit is the correct
one.
<P>

(5)	On arriving in Sydney the plaintiff was sent on leave.  He travelled by
train to Temora where he was met by his parents.  He
was taken to Temora
hospital where he stayed for two weeks.  He was having difficulty breathing and
felt very ill.  He did not tell
anyone about being in the water as he did not
want to think or talk about the awful experience.  On 17 March 1964  the
plaintiff
was discharged from hospital he returned to the Melbourne.  Although
he still was unwell the plaintiff feared disciplinary action
if he did not
return to his ship.  
<P>

(6)	The plaintiff did not want to return to the Melbourne as he feared
returning to sea. He grew to detest the Navy and the officer
that had ruined
his life and he wanted to leave the service.  He began arguing with his
superiors and fellow serviceman.  He did
not want to think about his experience
but could not get the thoughts, fear and horrors out of his mind.  When alone
he would suddenly
break out crying.  He began to drink heavily and his smoking
increased to three packets per day.  He did not smoke at all prior to
the
collision.
<P>

(7)	In 1965 the plaintiff was transferred to be an Admirals Orderly.
Eventually he became a Navy Writer or clerk.  He made two unsuccessful
attempts
to be discharged from the Navy.  On 3 April 1974 the plaintiff was discharged
from the Navy.  
<P>

(8)	Between 1977 and 1983 the plaintiff was employed.  He was involved in
hyperbaric diving on oil rigs and became a hyperbaric
systems engineer for
which he was handsomely paid.  Things were going well at the time, he did not
known that he was anxious and
depressed.  He was sometimes angry but attributed
that to his high pressure job.  He was able to control his emotions by using
alcohol
to excess.  He had flashbacks and bad dreams about the collision but
they were not frequent.
<P>

(9)	In 1982 the plaintiff was employed at a vineyard.  He suffered an injury
when a wine barrel fell on his back.  The pain in his
back subsequently largely
resolved itself.  In 1991 he under went a spinal fusion and laminectomy.
<P>

(10)	From 1983 to 1993 the plaintiff undertook tertiary studies.  He completed
a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education.  He
commenced a law degree but
was unable to complete it.  He is now unable to work at all.
<P>

(11)	The turning point in the plaintiff's psychiatric condition occurred when
he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. On 26
September 1993 he was a
passenger in a motor vehicle which was involved in a rear end collision.  Since
the motor vehicle accident
the plaintiff's symptoms have become more
pronounced.  The plaintiff commenced legal proceedings in relation to the motor
vehicle
accident but later withdrew them.  There are no current proceedings on
foot.  Since 1995 the nightmares of the collision and flashbacks
have increased
in number.  His depression, anxiety and stress has increased.  He suffers more
frequently from panic attacks, headaches
and sweats.  The plaintiff thought
that these problems may have been caused by the motor vehicle accident.  Prior
to the motor vehicle
accident he new subconsciously that something was wrong
but did not know what it was.  He knew he could not get on with people. 
He did
not attribute any of his problems to the collision.  The plaintiff had never
discussed the Melbourne/Voyager collision with
anyone.  The reason he did not
mention it was initially he thought he would get into trouble and  the only way
he felt he could handle
it was by holding the information in and not telling
anyone.
<P>

(12)	In August 1996 the plaintiff completed an application for a disability
pension and listed five injuries, firstly, decreased
hearing in the left ear;
secondly, breathing problems;  thirdly, upper and lower back and muscle
problems sustained when he fell
in a sponson (walking beside a flight deck) due
to a loaded raft from a jet aircraft;  fourthly, headaches, stress from pain
and
fifthly, stress and anxiety from seeing people killed and injured arising
from his period of service in the Navy.  These problems
are not listed in
priority order.
<P>

(13)	On 24 September 1996 he saw Dr Leonard Lambeth a psychiatrist, initially
in regard to the motor vehicle accident.  When he
was being examined by Dr
Lambeth and discussing his problems including nightmares regarding the
collision, the plaintiff became aware
he was suffering from a psychiatric
disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic major depression
which was or has
been caused by the collision between the Melbourne and
Voyager.  This was the first time he had discussed the collision with anyone.
Dr Lambeth says that the plaintiff's PTSD and depression have two causes,
namely, the effects of the collision and the effects of
the motor vehicle
accident in 1993.  Dr Lambeth is of the opinion that the plaintiff needs
treatment for his psychological disorders.
<P>

(14)	The plaintiff has attributed his being unable to work, and the loss of
several careers the latest being that of becoming a
lawyer;  the breakdown of
two marriages;  damaged relationships with his children and friends;  and loss
of confidence and self esteem,
to the collision.
<P>

(15)	Until the plaintiff read the statement of claim in 1997 he had no
knowledge of any acts of negligence of the defendant, and
he did not know that
the acts of negligence caused his psychiatric damage.
<P>

(16)	The statement of claim was filed on 14 August 1997.
<P>

(17)	The notice of motion to extend time was filed on 14 August 1997.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

4  	The plaintiff relies s 60G and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act, 1969</a>.
The parties agreed that this is the applicable law. The approach to be adopted
in dealing with applications for the extension of
limitation periods, is that
which has been expounded in recent times in <b><u>Brisbane South Regional
Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a> and in
<b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors)</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported, 7 March 1997).  The onus rests with the applicant.  
<P>

5  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60G</a> empowers the court to extend the limitation period,
if it is just and reasonable to do so, "for such period as it determines".
<P>

6  	The relevant provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> are as follows:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">60H</a> unless it is satisfied
that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

7  	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>, the
plaintiff must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at 10 February 1970 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period)
he was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(i)</a>, (ii)
or (iii);
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)</a> (or the last of those matters to become known to him)
earlier than 14 August 1994.
<P>

<u>8  	</u>The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to
identify specifically what fact or facts he claims not to have known as at 10
February 1970, which lack of knowledge meets the description in one or more of
paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)</a>;  and to show (by evidence) the
date on which he acquired knowledge thereof (being a date later than 14 August
1994);  or to show
that that fact was or those facts were still unknown to him
on that date.  The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff ought
to have
become aware of the matters listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date -
see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(b).</a>
<P>

9  	The plaintiff relies on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(i)</a>, (ii) and (iii).  The
plaintiff submitted that he was unaware that he suffered the psychiatric
condition of PTSD and major depression.
 The plaintiff also submitted that he
did not know of the connection between the personal injury and the defendant's
acts and omissions
until 1997.  The defendant did not make any submissions in
relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(i)</a>-(iii).
<P>

<b>(i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that "he did not know that a
personal injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

10  	The plaintiff knew that he had difficulty breathing after the
collision when he became an in-patient at Temora hospital for
two weeks.  At
the expiration of the limitation period he knew that he was drinking heavily,
smoking and gambling.  He knew he was
anxious, angry, frightened, had lost
confidence and was argumentative.  He did not known that he suffered from a
psychiatric illness.
 
<P>

11  	In September 1996 the plaintiff was told by a psychiatrist that
he suffered from PTSD and major depression materially caused
by the collision.
As was stated by the Full Federal Court in <b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v
Dinnison</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56 FCR 389</a> (per Gummow and Cooper JJ at p 402) it is
important to appreciate that the personal injury that the plaintiff suffered
was a psychiatric
illness.  I accept that the plaintiff was not aware until
September 1996 that he suffered a personal injury.  The plaintiff has passed
through the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(i)</a> gateway.
<P>

<b>(ii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of the nature
or extent of the personal injury suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

12  	The test of knowledge posed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(ii)</a> requires the
court to look at the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither the
reasonableness of that awareness nor constructive
knowledge is an element of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60I(1)(a)</a> - (<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186
CLR 1</a> at pp 9 and 10).  <b><u>Harris</u></b> is a case of a disease of gradual
onset.
<P>

13  	The nature or extent of the injury which the plaintiff has
sustained is to be determined as an objective fact as at the date
of the
hearing of the application.  A plaintiff may be held to have been aware of the
nature or extent of his injury within the relevant
period if during that period
he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having upon him and of its
likely future course,
even though he may have been unaware of the precise
pathology or medical diagnosis.  In particular if the applicant was aware that
the injury would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the
injury for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1)(a)(ii) even though the injury developed
particular consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee.  As long
as the
consequences are of a kind that an applicant expects, the applicant will
be aware of the extent of the injury (<b><u>Harris</u></b> pp 13 and 14).  I
have referred to the state of the plaintiff's knowledge prior to the limitation
period under the heading <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1)(a)(i).
<P>

14  	For the reasons given under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(i)</a> it is my view that
the plaintiff did not know the nature or extent of his personal injury until
September 1996 when he knew that
he had a diagnosable psychiatric illness.
This falls within the period stipulated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(b).</a>  It is my view that the
plaintiff has passed through the 60I(1)(a)(ii) gateway.  
<P>

<b>(iii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff was "unaware of the connection between
personal injury and the defendant's act or omission</u>"</b>
<P>

15  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> is concerned with ignorance of the
existence of acts and omissions rather than legal conclusions.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff submitted that it was not until he read the
statement of claim in 1997 and specifically the particulars of negligence
that
he was aware of the factors that contributed to the collision and that those
factors represented acts of negligence by the defendant
its servants or

<P>

17  	The acts or omissions referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> are the
acts or omissions on which the plaintiff relied to found the cause of action
referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G.</a>  Those acts or omissions, will be found in the
plaintiff's particulars of negligence. - <b><u>Drayton Coal Board Pty Limited v
Drain</u></b> NSWCA, Gleeson CJ, unreported 22 August 1995).
<P>

18  	In paragraph 5(a) to (p) of the statement of claim the plaintiff
gives particulars of negligence as against the officers of
the Voyager.  They
are as follows:
<P>

<b>(a)	Causing Voyager to make a turn beyond a course of 020 degrees when not
ordered to do so;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	Failing to correctly carry out orders transmitted from Melbourne to
Voyager;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	Failing to correctly receive orders transmitted from Melbourne to
Voyager;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	Causing or permitting Voyager to take up a course of other than that
indicated by signals from Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	Failing to correctly transmit as orders, signals received from
Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(f)	Causing or permitting Voyager to proceed on a course across and close to
the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	Causing or permitting Voyager to proceed upon a course and at a speed
taking her across and close to the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(h)	Failing to alter the course or speed of Voyager in time to avoid a
collision;</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	Failing to maintain a constant and efficient watch;</b>
<P>

<b>(j)	Failing to observe in sufficient time or at all that if the course and
speed of Voyager and Melbourne remained constant a collision
was likely to
occur;</b>
<P>

<b>(k)	Failing to warn Melbourne that Voyager was proceeding upon a course
across and close to the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(l)	Failing to warn Melbourne that a collision was imminent;</b>
<P>

<b>(m)	Failing to give right of way to Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(n)	Failing to ensure that Voyager and its equipment were in a seaworthy and
safe condition;</b>
<P>

<b>(o)	Failing to ensure that all persons on Voyager were properly trained and
prepared for the eventuality of a collision or other catastrophe;</b>
<P>

<b>(p)	Failing to maintain any or any adequate lookout.</b>
<P>

19  	Similarly, there are particulars of negligence given in relation
to the officers of the Melbourne and further particulars of
negligence of other
officers and servants of the Commonwealth of Australia.
<P>

20  	I accept that it was not until 1997 when the plaintiff read the
statement of claim that he became aware of the connection between
the personal
injury and the defendant's acts and omissions.  This falls within the time
period stipulated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(b).</a>  The plaintiff has passed through the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> gateway.
<P>

21  	As the plaintiff has passed through all three <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)</a>
gateways I turn to consider whether it is just and reasonable to extend the
limitation period.
<P>

<b><u>Just and reasonable</u></b>
<P>

22  	I turn now to consider whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period.  The nature of the discretion conferred
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
31(2)</a> of the <b>Queensland Limitations Act</b> was considered by the High Court
in <b><u>Taylor</u></b>.  Section 31(2) is almost identical to s 58(2) of the
New South Wales <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.</b>  The Court of Appeal has applied
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> in <b><u>Giudice</u></b> and in
<b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b> (1997) 14 NSWLR p 389.
<P>

23  	Firstly, I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has a real
case to advance.  In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>, the applicant bears an evidentiary and
persuasive onus which, in the absence of concession, requires material to be
adduced which
demonstrates that the dilatory plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  The need for the court to decide that it is just and reasonable
to
extend the limitation period must focus attention on the question whether there
is indeed evidence to establish the plaintiff's
cause of action.  It would
rarely be possible to say that it was just and reasonable to subject the
defendant to litigation otherwise
statute barred if it did not appear that
there was evidence available to the plaintiff to establish his cause of action.
(See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported Badgery-Parker J, 1
May 1997);  <b><u>Ortado v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported, Badgery-Parker J,
1 May 1997);  <b><u>Lewis v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported, Badgery-Parker
J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported 26 February 1998) and <b><u>Dow Corning Australia Pty Ltd v
Paton</u></b>, <b><u>Meares v Paton</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 24 April 1998)
and <b><u>Fitzgerald v Bankstown City Council</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 6
November 1995).  
<P>

24  	The defendant submitted that even if the plaintiff had a real
cause of action to advance it was so trivial that it was not
just and
reasonable to extend the limitation period.  The plaintiff was employed by the
defendant.  The defendant as employer of
the plaintiff had a duty of care to
the plaintiff.  The foreseeability of the plaintiff's damage will be in issue
at the trial. 
It is the plaintiff's contention that as a result of his
experience of being on board the Melbourne when it was hit by the Voyager
he
suffered PTSD and major depression.  Since 1993 the plaintiff has suffered a
loss of earning capacity.  The plaintiff still has
12 years to go until he
reaches retirement age.  The case is not without its complexities as there is
an overlap between the damages
suffered in the motor vehicle accident and the
collision.  However, it it my view that after 1995 the plaintiff's psychiatric
condition
worsened markedly and he may be unable to gain employment in the
future.  It can be argued that the collision materially contributed
to his
injuries.  The case is not a trivial one and the plaintiff has a real case to
advance.
<P>

25  	I tun now to the effects of delay and what was said in
<b><u>Taylor</u></b>.
<P>

26  	In <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> the Court of Appeal considered the
effect of <b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to the extension of the limitation
period of a case which falls into subdivision 2 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b>
1969 - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a>.  
<P>

27  	Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  The President quoted the passage by McHugh J
which begins "Legislatures enact" and was of the view that Dawson J agreed with
McHugh J.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that Dawson and
McHugh JJ appeared to indicate that it is mandatory
that the applicant negate
"significant prejudice" before the discretion could be exercised in his or her
favour. 
<P>

28  	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed
themselves in the following terms.
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

29  	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the
notion of "significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances
of a fair trial unlikely".  In determining whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period in this
application I will examine whether the
delay has made "the chances of a fair trial unlikely" or whether the defendant
would suffer
"significant prejudice".
<P>

30  	The defendant has admitted the collision but denied it was
negligent.  I accept that with the passing of 35 years, there is
the real
possibility some witnesses may not be available to give evidence at the trial.
It can also be expected that memories will
have faded with the effluxion of
time and some witnesses may no longer be alive or able to be located.
Indisputably there is presumptive
prejudice. However the defendant did not
furnish evidence to demonstrate that it suffers from actual prejudice. 
<P>

31  	Generally speaking, the lengthy delay may well confront the
defendant with a difficult task in investigating a claim for damages.
 There
are Navy records showing that at the time that the plaintiff joined the Navy he
was in good physical and psychological health.
 The events surrounding the
collision are well known and there is documentary evidence available - see
<b><u>McLean v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 41 NSWLR 389</a> and
<b><u>Lynch v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 16
October 1998, Master Harrison).  There are also decisions in relation to
extension of time of the limitation
period for Voyager/Melbourne claims by
Master Malpass.  The plaintiff's service and medical records throughout his
service in the
Navy are available.  Records from Temora hospital are available.
The plaintiff's general practitioner who completed his pension form
in 1996 is
available to give evidence.  However the two versions of where the plaintiff
was when the collision occurred mean that
the defendant will have to locate
witnesses if they wish to challenge the plaintiff's evidence.  Each member on
board the Melbourne
and Voyager at the time of the collision completed the
questionnaire so there will still be witnesses who can give evidence.
<P>

32  	After I have taken into account all of these matters, the
exercise of discretion is finely balanced.  After much reflection
I am not
satisfied that the "chances of the defendant obtaining a fair trial is
unlikely" nor am I satisfied that the defendant will
suffer "significant
prejudice".  The plaintiff has discharged his onus and satisfied me that it is
just and reasonable for an order
to be made that the limitation period be
extended.  The appropriate order for costs is that costs be costs in the
cause.
<P>

33  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings in this court for damages in respect of an
accident which occurred
on 10 February 1964 up to and including 14 August 1997.
<P>

(2)	Costs are costs in the cause.
