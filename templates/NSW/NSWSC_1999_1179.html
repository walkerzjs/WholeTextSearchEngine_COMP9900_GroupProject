<b>GREGORY WINFIELD HALL </b>
<P>

Plaintiff
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT  --  </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>18 November 1999</b>
<P>

1   	This is an application by the Liquidator of Richard Walter
Pty Limited, pursuant to s588FF(3)(b) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> for an
extension of time within which application may be made to the court in respect
of a voidable transaction of that Company.
 Without such an order the time
within which such an application could be made will expire on 20 November
1999.
<P>

2   	The guidelines applicable to such an exercise of discretion
are collected by Hamilton J in <i>Hall &amp; Another: In the matter of ACN 063
865 083 (formerly Digicall Direct Pty Ltd) and Others</i> ([1999] NSWSC 984, 7
September 1999, unreported);  see also <i>Taylor v Woden Constructions Pty
Ltd</i> [1998] 1228 FCA per Finn J;  <i>Green v Chiswell Furniture</i> <i>Pty
Ltd in Liq. </i>([1999] NSWSC 608 Austin J, 23 June 1999, unreported).  I set
these out in summary form, noting, as I explain, that (ii) need not
always
apply, having regard to the circumstances impeding a preliminary review:
<P>

(i)	Is there a satisfactory explanation for delay?
<P>

(ii)	Is there a sufficiently arguable case of a preference, on a preliminary
review of the facts, to justify the continued exposure
of the possible
defendants to action?
<P>

(iii)	Is there some likely actual prejudice to the possible defendants which
arises from the delay which outweighs the case in justification
of an extension
of time?
<P>

(iv)	Is a preliminary review of the case inappropriate because the Liquidator
has not completed investigations into the preferences?
<P>

3   	The present case is one where an extension of time is
sought to be justified for the following reasons, drawn from the evidence
collected in the affidavit of Mr Hall the Liquidator dated 16 November 1999
(taken from the written submissions of counsel dated
18 November 1999): 
<P>

(i)	The Liquidator is currently awaiting the judgment  of the Full Federal
Court in <i>Richard Walter Pty Ltd (in liq) v Commissioner of Taxation and
Others</i>.  The outcome of this appeal will have a direct bearing upon whether
it is possible or appropriate for the Liquidator to pursue remedies
under Part
5.7B <i>Corporations Law</i>.  Furthermore, the appeal will determine whether
or not the assets currently under the control of the Liquidator are subject to
a
charge in favour of certain claimants.  The outcome of this appeal will have
a direct bearing upon whether there are sufficient funds
available for the
prosecution of actions under Part 5.7B <i>Corporations Law</i> or, indeed, for
the remuneration of the Liquidator.
<P>

(ii)	The Liquidator has diligently carried out his duties in a large and
complex winding up.  He has not been able to finally determine
whether grounds
exist for the prosecution of applications pursuant to Part 5.7B, whether such
applications are in the best interests
of creditors, the prospects of success
and recoverability of the potential preferential transactions or the likely
outcome of such
proceedings.  The identity of the proper defendants has not yet
been established.
<P>

(iii)	There is no prejudice likely to be suffered by the related party entities
in the circumstances described by the affidavit.
<P>

(iv)	The proposed period of extension is not inappropriate in the
circumstances.
<P>

4   	This is not a case where the very preliminary review of the
merits of any proceedings to recover in respect of any voidable
transaction of
the Company yields any conclusion one way or the other.  The Liquidator has yet
to form a view as to whether there
is a sufficiently arguable case of a
preference and needs further time to do so.  In saying that, I do not doubt
that the Liquidator
will have formed some initial impressions but reasonably
enough does not feel yet in a position to elevate those views to any sort
of
conclusion. 
<P>

5   	For the reasons given by Austin J in <i>Green v Chiswell
Furniture</i>.  I am satisfied that provided the orders are framed
appropriately, that circumstance should not preclude the extension sought. 
I
quote from the relevant parts of that judgment as follows:
<P>

"15.	Considerations relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion under
s588FF(3) were stated by Finn J in <i>Taylor v Woden Constructions Pty Ltd</i>
(Federal Court, 23/8/98, unreported).  The following propositions, with which I
respectively agree, emerge from that case:
<P>

(a)	ordinarily, the issues raised on an extension application are threefold:
<P>

(i)	the explanation for the delay in bringing proceedings;
<P>

(ii)	a preliminary review of merits of the foreshadowed proceedings  -- that
is, an investigation as to whether such proceedings
should be so devoid of
prospects that it would be unfair, by granting an extension, to expose the
other party to the continuing prospect
of suit;
<P>

(iii)	whether the likely actual prejudice resulting from the grant of an
extension is sufficiently substantial to outweigh the case
for granting an
extension;
<P>

(b)	where the liquidator's purpose in seeking the extension of time is simply
to put himself into a position where he can properly
decide whether or not to
bring proceedings, a preliminary inquiry into the merits of any consequent
proceedings may not always be
necessary.
<P>

In the present case there is no evidence of any prejudice which would flow from
granting an extension and so that is not an issue.
<P>

16.	In my opinion, there is a risk that in some cases a preliminary inquiry
into the merits may impose an unnecessary burden on
both the liquidator and the
Court, especially in a case where the circumstances appear to give rise to
complex or disputed questions
of fact and law and the evidence before the Court
is manifestly incomplete."
<P>

6   	It will be seen from the form of the orders that follow,
that what is contemplated is an extension of time first to accommodate
the
handing down of a decision on the appeal by the Full Federal Court and then a
further three months for further investigation.
 The latter three months can
also accommodate any application for leave to appeal to the High Court.  My
orders contemplate a requirement
to notify the other potential parties to any
application in respect of any alleged voidable transaction, as and when they
are ascertained.
 Notification would be both of the orders made and of this
judgment.  That, coupled with the leave to appear for either party, will
allow
any submissions to be made.  This may bear upon either the continuance of the
extension or upon any further extension as may
be required by the Liquidator.
The latter is not unlikely, given the complexity of the corporate and private
trust circumstances
with their associated transactions.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

1.	Order pursuant to section 588FF(3)(b) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> that
the time for the applicant liquidator to commence proceedings pursuant to the
provisions of Part 5.7B of the <i>Corporations Law</i> be extended to the date
which is the earlier of:
<P>

(a)	20 November 2000 and
<P>

(b)	the date three calendar months after the determination by the Full Court of
the Federal Court of Australia of the appeals in
the proceedings numbered NG
344 of 1999 and NG 339 of 1999 in the Federal Court of Australia.
<P>

2.	Grant liberty to apply in respect of Order 1 to the applicant and any person
affected by Order 1.
<P>

3.	Direct that the applicant notify in writing any person against whom he
determines he shall seek relief pursuant to Part 5.7B
of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>, at the time of making of that determination, of the terms of the above
order and grant of liberty to apply and this direction.
