<b>FRIDAY 4 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>NO 70045/98  -   REGINA   V   MURRAY WALTER HEARNE</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE:</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner Murray Walter Hearne has been
<P>

indicted on two charges: 
<P>

a)   The murder on 28 February 1998 of Constable Peter Forsyth; and 
<P>

b)   The malicious wounding of Constable Jason Semple on 27 February 1998, with
intent to do him grievous bodily harm.
<P>

2  	To those charges, for which the maximum available penalties under
ss 18 and 33 of the Crimes Act respectively are penal servitude
for life and
penal servitude for twenty five years, the prisoner has pleaded guilty.  He is
now to be sentenced accordingly.
<P>

3  	The evidence tendered before me discloses that on the evening of
Friday 27 February 1998, the prisoner and his half brother
Scott Van Meurs met
his half sister Tiffany Thorne and another girl, Cassandra Wee, near the Ultimo
Community Centre.  It had been
their intention to attend a dance at the Centre
but when they learned that it had been cancelled at the last moment due to
rain,
they decided to go on into the City.  After filling in time at an
amusement centre and at a snooker parlour, they returned to the
Centre where
they expected to be picked up by the father of Tiffany Thorne.
<P>

4  	While waiting for Mr Thorne on the corner of Bulwarra Road and
William Henry Street, the prisoner tried unsuccessfully to sell
a tablet, which
was said to be Ecstasy, to some young girls.  At about 11.20pm the prisoner and
his companions observed Constables
Forsyth, Semple and Neville, who were off
duty police, walking towards them. Each of these police officers had been
drinking for
about an hour and a half at the Lord Wolsley Hotel in Bulwarra
Road. Constable Forsyth was dressed in a T shirt, shorts and joggers.
Constable Semple was still wearing his police trousers and boots but he had
replaced his shirt with a T shirt.  Constable Neville
was wearing a light
coloured shirt and jeans.  Before leaving the hotel Constables Neville and
Semple had drunk four schooners each
of beer, some of which were light.
Constable Forsyth had drunk five schooners the last of which was a light beer.
Patrons and bar
staff said that none of these men had misbehaved themselves
while at the hotel or had given any signs of being affected to any significant
degree by alcohol.  Blood alcohol concentrations tested late that night,
following the injuries which two of the officers sustained,
would generally
support that assessment.
<P>

5  	Constable Forsyth in fact lived with his wife and two children in
Hackett Street, a short distance from the Community Centre
and the hotel.  He
and the other officers had decided to walk a little further down William Henry
Street to look into another hotel
in that street.
<P>

6  	Tiffany Thorne gave a wolf whistle when she saw these men.  At
the prisoner's request, Scott Van Meurs yelled out to them, "Do
you want to buy
an E".  Constable Neville said that he called him over and asked him what he
had.  He replied, "I've got one E left".
 Constable Neville asked where it was
and Van Meurs then asked him, "Are you cops". Constable Neville again asked
where the tablet
was.  Van Meurs said that his brother had it and after saying
that it would cost $40 he called over the prisoner.  Constable Semple
gave a
slightly different version to the effect that when Van Meurs came over
Constable Neville said to him, "You're a bloody idiot
mate, do you always come
and ask people this?"  Additionally he said that the question from Van Meurs as
to whether they were police
followed the inquiry where the Ecstasy was, as well
as the advice that Van Meurs' brother had it.   He said that the reply by
Constable
Neville to Van Meurs' question was, "Listen, I've got money, mate",
an observation which Constable Neville did not recall making.
<P>

7  	When the prisoner joined them Constable Neville said that he was
asked, either by Constable Forsyth or by Constable Semple,
what he had.  He
produced a small clear resealable plastic bag containing a tablet.  Constable
Semple's recollection was that there
was a conversation with the prisoner along
those lines but he thought that it was Constable Neville who had asked him what
he had.
 Constable Neville said that he asked the prisoner where he had
obtained the tablet, to which he received the reply, "Blacktown".
 When asked
from whom he obtained it the prisoner replied, "A friend, Ahmed".  This
conversation  Constable Semple and Neville both
said occurred in the vicinity
of a recessed doorway, or alcove. 
<P>

8  	Constable Neville said that while he was having the conversation,
Constable Forsyth had taken the prisoner by the right arm
and chest and had
pushed him into the recess up against the door.  Constable Forsyth, he said,
asked him, "Do you know who we are?"
 Constable Semple said that both the
prisoner and Van Meurs were manoeuvred into this alcove and that he and
Constable Forsyth ended
up facing the prisoner while Constable Neville stood
directly in front of Van Meurs.  He recalled Constable Forsyth prefacing the
question mentioned by Constable Neville with the words, "You'se are bloody
idiots."  When the question was put which he thought was,
"You know who we are,
don't you", he noticed the prisoner looked down at his police boots and uniform
trousers.
<P>

9  	Constable Neville turned his attention at this stage to Van Meurs
because he attempted to run away.  He seized Van Meurs by
the arm and asked him
if he had identification.  Van Meurs asked, "Are you cops", to which Constable
Neville said he replied, "Yes".
 Van Meurs reached into his pocket and pulled
out what appeared to be some bank notes.  At this stage they were a metre or so
away
from the prisoner and the other police.  Whilst Constable Neville was
talking to Van Meurs he said that he heard Constable Forsyth
instruct the
prisoner to sit down.  Constable Neville said that he gave Van Meurs a similar
instruction.  Before those instructions
were given Constable Semple had a
recollection of Constable Forsyth saying, "You are drug dealers.  I live in
this street, I've got
kids that live in this street". 
<P>

10  	He noticed the prisoner sit down on his haunches.  When the
prisoner was asked for his identification Constable Semple said
that he stood
and he began to rifle through his bum bag.  Constable Semple said that he then
became aggressive and said, "I'm going,
I'm out of here".  Both Constable
Semple and Forsyth grabbed him by the upper body and pushed him back against
the door.  He was
told that he was not going anywhere.  He began to struggle
with Constables Forsyth and Semple who tried to contain him.  It was at
this
stage that Constable Semple said that he felt blows to his chest and stomach.
He stumbled back, pulled up his T shirt and saw
blood pouring from his chest
and stomach.  He yelled out, "Pete, he's got a knife". 
<P>

11  	Constable Neville said that he noticed the prisoner grappling
with Constables Forsyth and Semple and that he heard Constable
Semple's warning
about the knife.  He then seized the prisoner from behind around the upper arms
and threw him towards the street.
 The prisoner, he said, stood his ground for
a short time and then ran away.
<P>

12  	In the meantime Van Meurs had already taken off and was heading
in a westerly direction down William Henry Street in front
of the prisoner.
Constable Neville pursued the prisoner a short distance but then returned to
assist the other officers after he
heard Constable Semple call out, "I'm
leaking".  It was realised at about the same time, that Constable Forsyth had
also been stabbed
because he had collapsed face forward.
<P>

13  	Ambulance and police officers responded quickly to a triple O
call and both officers were conveyed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
after
treatment at the scene. Although the precise sequence of blows is not known it
is now evident that, during the grappling described
by Constables Neville and
Semple, the prisoner stabbed Constable Forsyth through the heart and Constable
Semple once in the abdomen
and once in the chest.  Constable Forsyth died from
the wounds to his heart shortly after midnight.  Constable Semple was
successfully
treated for his wounds which included lacerations to his anterior
stomach wall, to his liver and to his left epigastric artery.
<P>

14  	After running for some distance from the scene of the stabbing,
the prisoner stopped near a car park.  He informed his companions
that he had
stabbed the men and he showed them the knife which had blood on the blade.
Tiffany Thorne said in an interview that was
tendered that, when she observed
that she had to tell someone what had happened, the prisoner replied that he
would kill her if she
did.  Some residents in the area did hear words
consistent with that threat spoken by a male person in the street.  A phone
call
was made to Mr Thorne by Tiffany advising that the prisoner and Scott Van
Meurs had been the victims of an attempted robbery and
had been beaten up.
They arranged to meet Mr Thorne at Central Railway.  While waiting for him the
prisoner changed into different
clothes which he had in a back pack.  He later
informed Mr Thorne that he had fought off the men who had attacked them and
that he
and Scott had escaped.  Mr Thorne drove the girls to their home in
Lilyfield and then drove the prisoner and Van Meurs to their home
at Blacktown.

<P>

15  	The prisoner telephoned his girlfriend, Alvina Narayan, and then
went to her flat at Chipping Norton where he spent the rest
of the night and
some of the next day.  During the morning following the incident, he informed
her that he had stabbed someone, although
it was again his account that three
men had jumped him and were going to kill him and his younger brother. He made
no mention of
any attempt to sell drugs or of any police officer being involved
in the incident.  Miss Narayan dropped the prisoner off at Parramatta
Railway
Station later that morning and he then caught the train back to Blacktown.  He
informed Mr Van Meurs senior that he and Scott
had walked over to speak to
three men who had gone aggro, had pushed Scott up against the wall and had
pushed him to the ground.
 He said that they informed him, "We're going to bash
the shit out of you, no, we're going to kill you".  He claimed to have head
butted one man and smacked the other over the face before they made good an
escape. 
<P>

16  	On 1 March he said to another girl, Casey-Lee Baxter, whom he
met at the Quix Service Station, that the person who had stabbed
the police
would be "pretty popular in gaol."  When she asked what he meant, he replied,
"Well the prisoners are going to admire
him for killing a cop".  A day or so
later she said that he told her that he had stabbed the police officers, and
had sterilised
the knife which he had hidden at his girlfriend's house.  He
also showed her several newspaper clippings concerning the murder that
he had
placed into an A4 art book.  In her presence Scott Van Meurs and the prisoner
discussed running away together.
<P>

17  	On 2 March the prisoner informed a young student, AB, who knew
Scott Van Meurs and his younger brother Tony, that he had tried
to sell a drug
to police and that he had stabbed the two officers involved.  Later that day Mr
Van Meurs senior began to question
the prisoner about the stabbing of the
police which was receiving extensive media coverage.  The prisoner denied any
involvement
in it, and said that the incident in which he and Scott had been
involved had occurred around the corner from the location where
the police had
been stabbed.
<P>

18  	On 2 March, acting on information, the police commenced physical
and electronic surveillance of the prisoner.  He and Scott
Van Meurs were
followed that day to a Blacktown disposal store where the prisoner was seen to
purchase a folding lock knife.  Phone
calls to and from his home were the
subject of lawful interception from this time.  The prisoner was heard in the
course of conversations
over this service to acknowledge that it was he who had
stabbed the two officers.  He was also heard to express concerns about police
identifying him and about others who knew of his involvement talking about him.
In a conversation with Tiffany Thorne he threatened
to have killed anyone who
"dobbed him in". 
<P>

19  	On the evening of 2 March the prisoner moved to his girlfriend's
flat at Chipping Norton.  When later that evening Scott Van
Meurs became aware
of police surveillance outside their home in Blacktown, he telephoned the
prisoner at the flat and cautioned him.
 In a number of phone calls they
discussed preparations for leaving Sydney.  These preparations including
procuring or stealing a
motor vehicle and assembling the necessary clothes and
other items for such a departure.
<P>

20  	In the early hours of 3 March, Scott Van Meurs' father became
aware, from a conversation with his son Tony, that the prisoner
had stabbed the
police and that he and Scott were planning flight.  He telephoned the prisoner
at his girlfriend's flat and asked
him if he had anything to do with the
stabbings.  The prisoner admitted being responsible but said that the police
had been drunk
and had threatened to kill him and Scott.  He said that after he
was threatened and kicked, he pulled out his knife and stabbed the
men.  In a
series of telephone calls Mr Van Meurs attempted to persuade him to surrender
himself to police.  He warned him that he
intended  telephoning police and the
prisoner's father.  He followed this up by placing those calls.  The prisoner
then spoke to
his father in Victoria and was advised by him to telephone the
newspapers and to give them his story.  In response to this advice
the prisoner
telephoned the Daily Telegraph and spoke to Mr Barclay Crawford.  
<P>

21  	In a statement prepared from the notes which he made, Mr
Crawford recalls the following salient details:
<P>

"Mr Hearne said, according to these notes, "My father had told me to tell you
this, the police started this, they bashed me and
my brother, they kicked me in
the ribs and the back of the legs, my brother is still bruised.  I could smell
beer on them.  They
say that these police are lovers of kids but it's all
bullshit.  The police made me stab them, they just turned on me..."
<P>

Mr Crawford said, "What did you talk to them, that is the police, about".  The
prisoner said, "You know, it's about, I can't really
remember".  Mr Crawford
said, "Well you must have talked about something, try and remember".  The
prisoner said, "Ah, just things
about the weather, how it was raining".  Mr
Crawford said, "What made them turn on you, you must have done something or
said something?"
 The prisoner said, "Nothing, nothing, they just snapped". 
<P>

Mr Crawford asked, "What happened then"?  The prisoner replied, "They were
drunk, they kicked me in the ribs and pushed both me
and Scotty into a corner
down on the ground".  Mr Crawford asked, "Did they tell you they were cops", to
which the prisoner replied,
"No, not once.  They just said, Let's get them,
let's kill them".  Mr Crawford asked, "OK, what happened then".  The prisoner
replied,
"I thought I was going to die because the cops said they were going to
kill me, so I pulled my knife out". 
<P>

Mr Crawford asked "Well, didn't the police see the knife", to which the
prisoner replied "No, because we were sitting down.  So
I pulled it out."  Mr
Crawford, "Where did you stab him"?  The prisoner replied, "He came at me again
and I stabbed him once.  Then
he came at me again and I stabbed him, I don't
know how many times".  Mr Crawford observed, "But you stabbed the other one
too, didn't
you?"  The prisoner said, "The other one came in and I stabbed
him".  When asked how many times, the prisoner replied, "I don't know,
I don't
know.  It happened so quick.  I just stabbed him and stabbed him". 
<P>

22  	When asked what kind of a knife he had used, the prisoner
replied, "A buck knife".  He was then asked, "What happened after
you stabbed
the second guy", to which the prisoner replied, "Scottie kicked the third guy
in the balls and I punched him in the head".

<P>

23  	He was specifically asked in this conversation whether any offer
had been made to sell drugs to the police.  He answered in
the negative.
<P>

24  	At about 5am on 3 March 1997 whilst still on the telephone to Mr
Crawford, the prisoner was arrested by police and later charged.
 When an
attempt was made to interview him he exercised his right to remain silent.  A
search of the prisoner's home and of his girlfriend's
flat turned up the bum
bag that he had been wearing and the art book but not the knife that had been
used. 
<P>

25  	A post mortem examination of Constable Forsyth revealed that the
stab wound track that had brought about his death had divided
it into two
paths.  This was consistent, Dr Du Flou said, with the knife having been
plunged into the body twice without it having
been fully removed between
thrusts, or with the deceased pulling back after moving on to the knife and
then moving back on to it
again. 
<P>

26  	The wounds which Constable Semple sustained were clearly the
result of separate blows showing that he was struck twice.
<P>

27  	The knife used in the stabbings has never been recovered.  The
tablet that was offered for sale as an Ecstasy tablet was however
found on the
roadway near where the stabbing occurred.  Analysis showed that it was not in
fact Ecstasy but a drug of the amphetamine
group similar to that substance. 
<P>

28  	Contrary to the version of events that was initially given to
Messrs Crawford, Thorne and Van Meurs senior, it is now accepted
that the
prisoner did attempt to sell to the police the tablet which was passed off as
Ecstasy.  It is also accepted that it was
he who stabbed the two police
officers.
<P>

29  	I have gone into this evidence in perhaps more detail than might
otherwise have been necessary, because there are two critical
factual issues of
relevance that require determination.  They are (a) whether the prisoner
intended to kill Constable Forsyth or
intended only to cause him really serious
bodily harm;  and (b) whether he knew that Constables Forsyth and Semple were
police at
the time that they were stabbed.  As a matter of law any reasonable
doubt on these issues needs to be resolved in favour of the prisoner:
<b>
O'Neill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSW%20LR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2 NSW LR 582</a> at 588, <b>Olbrich</b>, NSW CCA 6 July 1998,
and <b>Storey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2089%20A%20Crim%20R%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 89 A Crim R 519.</a>
<P>

30  	The first issue can be readily decided.  The plea in relation to
the charge concerning Constable Semple has been accepted upon
the basis that
the prisoner's intention was to cause him grievous bodily harm rather than to
kill.  I am unable upon the evidence,
and in the absence of any admission of an
intention to kill Constable Forsyth, to reach any different conclusion as to
the prisoner's
state of mind in relation to the charge of murder.  Clearly the
prisoner used the knife to make good an escape from the situation
in which he
found himself.  Equally clearly he intended at least to inflict sufficient
bodily harm to achieve that purpose.  While
the location of the injury, on one
view, might suggest an intention to kill, the reality is that in a night time
struggle involving
men who were moving, it is impossible to be satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the prisoner deliberately aimed the knife at Constable
Forsyth's heart.  It is equally impossible to reach any firm conclusion as to
the angle at which Constable Forsyth's torso stood
in relation to the prisoner
when he was stabbed.  Accordingly I find that the state of mind of the prisoner
for the offence of murder
was that involving an intention to inflict grievous
bodily harm.
<P>

31  	I observe however that this finding does not mean that the
offence was other than one of a most serious kind.  As will be emphasised
later, the carriage of knives is not acceptable to the community and their use
to inflict bodily harm or death inevitably involves
objective criminality of a
very high degree.
<P>

32  	I turn then to the important issue as to whether the prisoner
knew that the persons he was stabbing were police officers. 
It may be assumed
that he did not know that they held such office at the time when the tablet was
offered to them.  Had he known
that to be the case, then he most certainly
would not have tried to sell them a substance which he believed to be a
drug.
<P>

33  	The critical question is whether there was anything in the
behaviour or words spoken by the police, over the relatively short
period
between the time that he was first spoken to and the time that he began his
escape, to bring home to him the fact that they
were police.  It is common
ground that at no stage did any of the police officers produce their police
warrant cards or badges or
pronounce formal words of arrest or caution.  It is
also the fact that in none of the telephone calls that were intercepted, or in
the pre arrest conversations recounted by friends and associates of the
prisoner, or in the recent conversation between the prisoner
and another
prisoner that was lawfully recorded pursuant to a listening device warrant, did
he expressly admit or even suggest that
he knew, before stabbing Constables
Semple and Forsyth, that they were police.  Indeed, in all of the accounts,
save for one possibly
equivocal conversation with a young person, AB, he
protested that he did not know that they were police until the following
morning.
<P>

34  	I turn first to that conversation which was recounted by the
witness AB.  According to him it included an observation by the
prisoner to the
following effect, "Me and Scott tried to sell a drug to a police officer but we
did not know he was a police officer.
 It got out of control then".  That final
sentence is possibly indicative of the fact that the incident got out of
control once the
prisoner realised that he had offered a drug to a police
officer.  But that is not the only inference available and it would not
by
itself be enough to support a finding that he did know the man to be a police
officer at that time.
<P>

35  	Of somewhat greater significance is the evidence of Cassandra
Wee who said that, when the prisoner caught up with the girls
after the
incident, he had remarked, "They threw away the tablet that cost forty dollars.
We started throwing punches at each other.
 I pulled out my knife and stabbed
all three".  After recalling that Scott Van Meurs had said, "I thought they
were going to hit
me, but I was lucky enough I didn't get hit", she continued
that the prisoner said, "They all said they had kids younger than us.
 They
showed the badges, they were undercover cops.  We started throwing punches at
each other.  That's when I pulled out the knife
and stabbed them".  
<P>

36  	She was cross examined to suggest that she had been in error in
recounting this part of the conversation, and that she had
reconstructed it
from the subsequent intensive media coverage, which had given great prominence
to the fact that the persons killed
and injured had been off duty police who
had identified themselves as such by showing their badges, and had been
endeavouring to
effect an arrest.  In the course of that cross examination she
acknowledged that until she was interviewed on 3 March she had not
wholly told
the truth. She also acknowledged having read the account of the incident in the
Telegraph on the Saturday morning after
it occurred, as well as the coverage in
the Sun Herald on the following Sunday.  In those articles she agreed that it
had been asserted
that the three officers had identified themselves as police,
had produced their badges and were only doing their job.  She agreed
that she
had also seen news broadcasts on television in which similar information had
been conveyed before speaking to police on
3 March and again on 12 March. 
<P>

37  	She remained firm in her recollection that the prisoner had told
her, when he caught up with them, that the persons he had
stabbed were police
but she did concede that it was possible that her recollection concerning
badges being shown may have been mixed
up with what she had learned from the
media.
<P>

38  	The other circumstances relied upon by the Crown, as pointing
towards a conclusion that having realised that he had offered
a drug to police,
the prisoner used the knife to escape arrest, turns upon the evidence of
Constables Semple and Neville.  In particular
they relate to the evidence which
they variously gave to the effect that, in the immediate presence of the
prisoner, Constable Neville
confirmed to Van Meurs that they were police, that
each of the prisoner and Van Meurs were asked to provide identification, that
Constable Forsyth asked the prisoner whether he realised who they were and that
each was restrained and instructed to behave in a
way that was more consistent
with their being under arrest than it was for them being under attack.
<P>

39  	The Crown relies also on the fact, as the prisoner conceded,
that he  had been very economical with the truth between the time
of the
offences and his arrest, having told deliberate lies to Mr Van Meurs senior and
to others concerning the events of this night.
 This does reflect adversely on
his credibility as a witness as does his post arrest conduct.  Additionally,
the Crown relies upon
the fact that in some versions given, the prisoner
asserted that the men had chased them or tried to rob them or were going to
kill
them, and that in one of the intercepted conversations he can be heard
reminding Scott Van Meurs of some of those matters in a way
that could be
understood as an encouragement to him to give a similar version, if interviewed
by police.  
<P>

40  	The opposite proposition was pursued by reference to the
evidence given by the prisoner, and by reference to the statements
provided by
Scott Van Meurs.  Together these were suggestive of a somewhat more aggressive
response by the three police officers
when they were offered the drugs, being
conduct which would have been inconsistent with a proper discharge of police
duties.  In
this regard, Van Meurs and the prisoner each said that the tablet
was taken from the prisoner by Constable Forsyth and thrown to
the gutter, that
they were told that was a waste of $40 and they were additionally told that
they were "Fucking drug dealers and
the scum of the earth and that they should
be bashed or killed".  They also suggested that the prisoner was struck in the
ribs and
the back of the knee when he was backed into the alcove and forced to
the ground.
<P>

41  	The prisoner acknowledged, in his evidence, that he had asked
Scott Van Meurs to offer the men the ecstasy tablet and added
that when he was
called over and before speaking to them, Scott Van Meurs had said to him that
he had inquired whether they were
police because they had been asking so many
questions.  Van Meurs, the prisoner acknowledged, had told him that they were
not police.
 This evidence does indicate that the possibility of the three men
being police was at least alive in their minds.  It was the prisoner's
account,
however, that he did not realise that they were police until he listened to the
news the following morning.  The prisoner
said, in his evidence, that he did
not have any dislike for police, that he respected their authority and that he
acted in the way
he did only out of fear that he or his brother would be
bashed.  He said that he would never have pulled the knife had he thought
that
the men were police as he feared that they would, in that event, have been
likely to shoot him. 
<P>

42  	I can accept so much of his answer as suggested the prisoner had
not in the past shown any general dislike for police, and
had been a person who
did respect their authority.  I cannot, however, accept the rest of this
account and particularly the last
portion.  It is not something that he said to
anybody else at the time, and it is more indicative of an ex post facto
invention than
it is of the fact.  
<P>

43  	The prisoner said that he had kept the scrap book or art book
only so that he could keep up to date with the progress of the
investigations,
particularly so that he could become aware of any police interest in him.
Further he said that he had thrown the
knife, which was used in the stabbings,
into a rubbish bin near the Parramatta Railway Station and had purchased a
replacement knife
for the purpose of placing police off the scent if he was
interviewed since forensic investigations of that weapon would eliminate
it as
the murder weapon.
<P>

44  	The two girls, Cassandra Wee and Tiffany Thorne, did not claim
to see or hear precisely what occurred between the prisoner
and the three men
as they were some little distance away across the road.  They did however say
that they saw the men struggling
or fighting, an observation that does not
carry the matter any further as it is common ground that there was something of
a struggle
towards the end.  
<P>

45  	It is true that in the various post incident conversations that
were attributed to the prisoner by other witnesses or that
were electronically
intercepted, he had adhered to a consistent core version that he and Van Meurs
were attacked by the three men
after they had offered the ecstasy tablet for
sale, that he did not know that they were police until the next day, and that
he acted
in the way that he did in order to protect himself and Scott Van
Meurs.
<P>

46  	His pleas of guilty, I expressly note, were entered not upon the
basis of a concession that he had lied in giving this account,
but rather upon
the basis that his response was excessive and was not such as would ground a
defence of self defence or a defence
or provocation. 
<P>

47  	I do not consider that much weight can be placed on the
interviews with Scott Van Meurs or Tiffany Thorne.  Each had an interest
to
serve, each has been shown to have lied and each had a motive to paint matters
in a more favourable light for their half brother,
the prisoner. 
<P>

48  	The credibility of the prisoner is affected by his lies,
particularly as to the offer of a drug and as to the whereabouts of
the knife,
a lie which he has continued even recently when speaking to a fellow prisoner.
It is also affected by his immediate post
offence conduct including his plans
for flight and the threat that he made in relation to people giving him up.  It
is further diminished
by the patently absurd explanation that he gave
concerning the manner in which he found the knife came to be in an open
position
when he removed it from his bum bag to the effect that it was either
already open in the bag, or that it became caught and opened
itself when it was
removed. 
<P>

49  	Each of Constables Semple and Neville gave evidence as to the
events leading up to the stabbings.  They impressed me as witnesses
of truth
and I do not accept that they were drunk or that they or Constable Forsyth
threatened or punched or kicked either the prisoner
or Van Meurs in the manner
which those persons described.  I have no doubt that they used some force to
restrain each man, particularly
when they tried to break away.  They were
lawfully entitled to do this and I am satisfied that all of them acted properly
in the
execution of their duty in endeavouring to make an arrest.  
<P>

50  	The problem however, as I see it, is that the time that elapsed
between the production of the tablet and the stabbings was
very short and on
Constable Neville's account he initially avoided the question whether he and
his companions were police.  While
it is obvious from that question, and from
the prisoner's evidence, that he and his brother held some suspicions in this
regard,
no warrant cards or badges were produced and no formal words of arrest
or caution were used.  Further, none of the three police officers
were so
dressed as to suggest positively that they held that office.  A question in the
terms such as, "You know who we are, don't
you", while inviting the possible
inference that they were police, was not conclusive of that fact.  Cassandra
Wee's evidence risks
having been tainted by what she later learned and I am
inclined to discount it for that reason, particularly as some of the remarks,
for example, those concerning the production of the badges must be
incorrect.
<P>

51  	The evidence that does carry more weight is that concerning the
fact that identification was requested, and the description
of the way in which
the two men were stopped and restrained, that being consistent with police
action.  However, I cannot be satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that the
prisoner knew that Constable Neville had told Van Meurs that they were police,
particularly as Constable
Semple said that he did not hear that being said.

<P>

52  	In all those circumstances, I am not prepared to find that the
prisoner had actual knowledge that the three men were police.
 He did however
know that he had been detained because of his attempts to sell a tablet of
Ecstasy to three men and he did realise
that he was potentially in some sort of
trouble because of it.  It was in those circumstances I am satisfied that he
used the knife,
not because he feared being bashed or kicked, but because he
wanted to escape the possibility of trouble arising in connection with
the
offer of supply.  The precise nature of that trouble was probably not fully
apparent to him at the time.  
<P>

53  	It may be finally accepted, in relation to the assessment of the
objective criminality of the prisoner, that his actions were
impulsive rather
than premeditated.  Had it been established beyond reasonable doubt that the
prisoner knew Constables Forsyth and
Semple were in fact police officers and
also that they were acting in the execution of their duty at the time of the
offences, then
this would have brought the case into the worst category,
justifying the maximum penalty of penal servitude for life or something
approaching it.  
<P>

54  	As has been repeatedly observed by the Court of Criminal Appeal,
police who are subjected to violence in the course of their
duties are entitled
to the full protection of the law, and offenders who are involved in crimes of
that kind must expect condign
punishment: see the decisions of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in <b>Crump</b> 7 February 1995, <b>Nasif</b> 10 March 1995,
and <b>Rees</b> 22 September 1995.  In <b>Adams</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20NSW%20SC%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSW SC 144</a>, I
stated my conclusion, to which I adhere in this case, that similar
considerations apply to those who inflict violence upon off
duty police so long
as the selection of the victim or the infliction of violence or the level of
violence applied, can properly be
said to relate to that office and not be
purely coincidental with it.  
<P>

55  	Although I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the
prisoner in this case had the knowledge that would attract an
application of
these decisions, the offences still fall within the upper range of seriousness
viewed objectively.  Those who carry
and use knives can expect very little by
way of mercy when they appear for sentence, see the decisions of the Court of
Criminal Appeal
in <b>Rothapfel</b> 4 August 1992, <b>Watt</b> 2 April 1997,
and <b>Bell</b> 29 September 1997.
<P>

56  	There exists, in this case, the need for a sentence that not
only imposes a significant element of personal punishment and
retribution but
additionally, and for the reasons explained in <b>Rushby</b>, (1997) 1NSWLR 594
at 597, carries with it, as a strong message of general deterrence, that this
community simply cannot and will
not condone the carrying or use of knives.  To
carry a knife, which in many instances will itself involve an offence,
inevitably
attracts a risk that it will be used.  I would be failing my duty if
I were to be weakly merciful in sentencing the present prisoner
who has used a
knife with the deadly consequences for one victim and the serious consequences
for another that I have described.
<P>

57  	I turn then to the subjective circumstances, the detail of which
emerged from the evidence of the prisoner and his father,
from a series of
character references provided on his behalf for sentencing purposes, from a
pre-sentence report and from a report
from a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore.
Together they serve to show that the prisoner was born on 4 May 1979 and was
accordingly three
months short of his 19th birthday at the time of the
offences.  His prior criminal history was of little moment comprising entries
for theft which have been dealt with by fine or equivalent, by a bond, or by
orders of compensation without any convictions having
been recorded.  So far as
evidence was led either through witnesses, or in the form of statements, to
suggest that the prisoner had
engaged in more extensive or serious criminal
activities in the past, I propose to disregard that as incorrect, and as having
been
motivated by a desire on the part of the prisoner to impress his peers as
a person to be reckoned with.  
<P>

58  	He is the eldest of three children and his parents divorced when
he was three years of age.  He lived thereafter with his father
and had little
contact with his mother.  Although his father was strict the prisoner has
described his formative years as generally
happy and supportive.  He left
school where he was a relatively poor performer at the age of 16, during Year
9.  Letters from his
primary and secondary school teachers show that he
presented as a boy who was well behaved and polite, non-aggressive and
co-operative
and protective of his siblings, although somewhat withdrawn and
lonely.  After leaving school he has been mostly unemployed, although
he has
held down some short term labouring jobs, including employment for a time with
a removalist company.  
<P>

59  	He had some history since the age of 14 years of illicit drug
use including cannabis, LSD, Ecstasy and cocaine, both while
living in Wodonga
with his father and later when he came to live with his step-father, Mr Van
Meurs, at Blacktown, at the age of
17 years.  This move, it was established
through the evidence of the prisoner and his father, occurred after he had been
present
when a friend stabbed two other young men in a fight in Wodonga.  The
prisoner had left town with this person but later returned
to assist police by
providing a statement and agreeing to give evidence in a trial of the offender.
He moved to Sydney, he said,
because of the fear of reprisal from the victims
and also because of his desire to obtain work.
<P>

60  	The prisoner was accustomed to carrying a knife on his person
but only, he said, when going fishing, which seemed to be his
principal
interest in life, when working in the removalist job, or when out with his
siblings.  The evidence points positively to
the conclusion, notwithstanding
his assertion to the contrary, that he was somewhat obsessed by knives.  At the
time of the offences
that bring him before the court he did, in fact, own five
knives, the one used in the killing of Constable Forsyth and the wounding
of
Constable Semple, a filleting knife, a tool knife, an army knife and another
folding knife which remained in his fishing tackle
box.  He had previously
owned another knife, which had been presented during an incident at a swimming
pool in a block of town houses
or home units in Blacktown, a month or so before
the matter that now brings him before the court.  On this occasion he was
present
when a younger brother became involved in a fight with another boy.
When the father of that boy intervened to break it up, the prisoner
presented
and threatened him with the knife at close quarters.  It was the prisoner's
account that he believed this man had a hammer
in his hand which he might use
to harm his brother.  
<P>

61  	I also observe that, in about December 1997, the prisoner had
been present in the Blacktown Shopping Centre with a group of
youths, including
a brother, when the brother was threatened with a knife by some Lebanese boys.
Although no fight ensued, the incident
was reported to the police and as a
consequence of it the prisoner decided to arm himself with a knife.  The
prisoner said, in fact,
that arising out of his concerns for the safety of
himself and his siblings in Sydney, it was his practice to carry a knife when
he was in their company.
<P>

62  	The various knives that he kept, he agreed, were regularly
cleaned and sharpened by him.  It was his practice to carry such
weapon, as was
the case on the night of the offences, in a bum bag.  Although reluctant to
admit that he always had a knife with
him, this is precisely what he said to Mr
Crawford.  It was also said to several young persons who provided statements
that were
tendered in evidence, to the effect that whenever they saw him, he
seemed to have a knife on him, and that he often spoke of knives
and produced
and played with them in public.  It was the fact that both his father and Mr
Van Meurs had expressed concern about this
habit, and had expressly cautioned
him on more than one occasion not to carry a knife on his person or to use it
for any improper
purpose.  In all those circumstances, I disbelieve the
evidence of the prisoner concerning the extent of his interest in knives and
regard it as an attempt to paint himself in a more favourable light.  I am not,
however, permitted to use this evidence as propensity
or tendency that might
show that he was by nature aggressive, or that he carried a knife about looking
for trouble or for an opportunity
to use it.  At most the evidence shows that
he was accustomed to carrying knives on his person, that he had observed at
first hand
and had been warned of the dangers associated with their use, and
that he was prepared, if the occasion arose, at least to threaten
someone with
one.  He acknowledged as much by his admission, that he entertained fears for
the safety of himself and his siblings,
and that it was for that reason that he
carried a knife generally when he was with them, and on this occasion in
particular.
<P>

63  	As I have observed, it is an inevitable risk for a person who
carries a knife for this reason, which is presented as a threat,
that the
situation will escalate to the point where it is used. 
<P>

64  	Mr Hearne and Mr Van Meurs senior each confirmed that the
prisoner had been a quiet and well mannered person who is generally
polite,
considerate and protective towards his two full siblings and six half siblings.
Other friends and relatives confirmed this
picture of him and added that he had
a healthy interest in sports, particularly soccer and fishing, that he had
respect for authority
and that he was loyal to his family and supportive of
them.  In general, they expressed the view that the offences were out of
character
for him.  I accept this assessment.
<P>

65  	The prisoner has used his time in custody so far to further his
education.  It is his intention to complete his studies to
Year 12 and then to
undertake a business course and a fitness instructor's course, each of which
will apparently be available to
him while in custody.  When he was first taken
into custody he was severely depressed and suicidal but it appears that this
was overcome
after a stay in the prison hospital, so there is no longer any
cause for concern in that regard.
<P>

66  	A report from Dr Westmore confirms that to be the case.  Dr
Westmore additionally found no signs of psychiatric illness, nor
any evidence
of an anti-social personality disorder, or for that matter, of any other
significant personality disorder or difficulty
that might carry with it a risk
of recidivism.  The prisoner has impressed both the author of the pre-sentence
report and Dr Westmore
as to being genuinely remorseful as to his actions.  I
accept from his evidence and from the evidence and material supplied by those
who have assessed him or otherwise known him, that this is now the case.  
<P>

67  	I am also assisted in coming to this conclusion by the apparent
spontaneous expression of regret that appears in the transcript
of the
conversation with the other prisoner that was recorded recently. There is no
reason to suppose that the prisoner knew or suspected
that this conversation
was being monitored, or that he saw any advantage in presenting a false
appearance of remorse to a fellow
prisoner.  
<P>

68  	I am not, however, persuaded that this remorse was always
present.  Nor am I persuaded that his remorse was entirely for the
widow and
family of Constable Forsyth or for Constable Semple.  Initially the prisoner
behaved in a way that suggested that he was
quite unconcerned for what he had
done, and considered himself to be a likely hero in certain quarters for the
stabbing of two police
officers.  The lack of remorse or any appreciation of
the enormity of these offences, at that time, is indicated by his response
in
lying about the incident, in disposing of the knife, in planning flight, in
keeping a very neat art book of media cuttings and
in purchasing a replacement
knife.  Whether that knife was acquired for the purposes of having it available
as a weapon or for the
purposes of putting the police off the scent if he was
spoken to, does not seem to me to matter.  The picture over the period between
the offences and the time of arrest is one of a person who was untroubled by
his acts, who was functioning deliberately and calmly,
 and was doing
everything he could to escape justice and whose concern was only for himself.
That position, I am persuaded, has changed
significantly since he has been in
custody and since he has been forced to confront the reality of his actions.

<P>

69  	I accept that he is now genuinely remorseful for what he has
done.  I am also satisfied that he remains very sorry for himself.
 In the
light of these various conclusions I am of the view, subject entirely to the
attitude that he takes to the opportunities
for further education and training
that are available in prison, and subject to the influences to which he becomes
subject, that
his chances of recidivism are relatively low and his prospects of
rehabilitation are generally favourable.  He will be sentenced
on that
basis.
<P>

70  	Before proceeding to sentence I note that I have read the victim
impact statement provided by the widow of Constable Forsyth,
by his elder
brother, Michael Forsyth,  and by Constables Semple and Neville.  They have
been tendered pursuant to section 23C of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act 1986</a>, but
in a case involving murder their use is strictly proscribed for the reasons
enunciated in <b>Previtera</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 ACR 76</a>, <b>Bollen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=99%20A%20Crim%20R%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">99 A Crim R
510</a>, and <b>Dang</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20NSW%20CCA%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSW CCA 42.</a>  Specifically I state that I am not
permitted by law, and I have not relied upon their contents, in order to asses
the extent of
the prisoner's objective criminality or in order to determine
what should be the appropriate sentence.  I wish to make reference
to them only
so far as I regard it proper for their contents to be place on to public
record, but in so doing I note that it is all
but impossible for me to
adequately reproduce the despair, the anger and the loss that their authors
have described.  
<P>

71  	In the case of Constables Semple and Neville, the statements
eloquently record the traumatic and powerful consequences to Constable
Semple
in receiving serious stab wounds, and the consequences for each of them in
observing a colleague killed while attempting to
execute his office, albeit
while off duty.  It is, in fact, a tribute to their courage and personal
strength that they have each
continued to serve as police officers.  
<P>

72  	In the case of Michael Forsyth, the statement similarly
describes the sad consequences for a brother and a mother losing a
person of
whom they were justifiably proud and with whom they were very close.  
<P>

73  	The statement from Jacqui Forsyth, in unequivocal terms,
describes the depth of the loss which she and her two young children
have
suffered.  She has said that the life of her family was full while Constable
Forsyth was alive but that all their hopes, dreams
and life plans have now been
shattered.  The distress and feelings she describes are palpable and her loss
may be accepted as tragic.

<P>

74  	Beyond those brief observations which, as I have observed do not
even begin to give justice to the depth of feelings described,
I cannot venture
lest I stray into a forbidden use of the statements.
<P>

75  	I return then to the exercise in sentencing that will complete
these reasons.  I record that the prisoner is entitled to the
benefit of his
pleas of guilty and I propose to take that into account in his favour when
determining an appropriate sentence.  This,
however, is a case where the plea
was entered at the last moment rather than at an early stage of the
proceedings.  While it can
still be taken as expressing a degree of contrition,
and while it has a  utilitarian value in saving the community the time and cost
of a criminal trial, the value of a late plea as a mitigating circumstance is
diminished, see <b>Winchester</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=58%20A%20Crim%20R%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">58 ACR 345</a> at 350 and 351, <b>Bishop</b>,
NSW CCA 23 September 1986, and <b>El Karhani</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20NSWLR%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 NSWLR 370</a> at 382.
<P>

76  	The age of the prisoner is also a matter which needs to be taken
into account in that there is a public interest, in the case
of a young
offender, in imposing a sentence that preserves a proper opportunity and
encouragement for rehabilitation.  The considerations
of punishment and general
deterrence, it has been accepted, should be regarded as subordinate to the need
to foster the interests
of rehabilitation in the case of a young offender, see
<b>Wilkie</b>, NSW CCA 2 July 1982, <b>Tran</b>, NSW CCA 109, and <b>GDP</b>,
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=53%20A%20Crim%20R%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">53 A Crim R 112.</a>  However, the significance of this factor diminishes the
nearer the offender is to adulthood: <b>Nguyen</b>, NSW CCA 14 April 1994, as
it does when the offender conducts himself like an adult and commits a
particularly serious crime: <b>Tran</b>, and see also <b>Townsend &amp;
Cooper</b>, NSW CCA 14 February 1995.  The present is a case where these
principles apply to reduce, although not entirely to exclude, any leniency
that
can be extended on account of the prisoner's youth.
<P>

77  	The two offences were part of a single episode, and regard must
be had to that fact in framing the sentences so as to ensure
that, in the
aggregate, it is just and appropriate to reflect the total criminality
involved, see <b>Ross</b>, NSW CCA 3 April 1991, <b>Holder &amp; Johnston</b>,
(1983) 3NSWLR 245, and <b>Mill</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 70</a>; ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20166%20CLR%2059" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 166 CLR 59.</a>  It is a matter for
discretion as to whether the sentences should be imposed cumulatively or
concurrently, <b>Vickers &amp; Fearon</b>, NSW CCA 17 October 1996, and
<b>Ross</b>.  The relevant principle was adequately expressed by King CJ in
<b>Attorney-General (SA) v Tichy</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2030%20SA%20SR%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 30 SA SR 84</a>, where his Honour said
at 85:
<P>

"The essential thing to be borne in mind is that if the sentences are made
consecutive that there be no over-lapping of the factors
brought into account
in determining the length of each sentence.  Similarly, if sentences are made
concurrent, the gravity of the
total criminal conduct must be reflected in the
leading sentence."
<P>

78  	I observe that as appears to be now required by <b>Pearce</b>,
1998
<P>

HCA 57, I am required to separately state what would otherwise be the separate
sentences for each offence.  In that regard I indicate
that I would regard as
an appropriate sentence for the murder, if it stood alone, to have been one
involving a minimum term in the
order of eighteen years, with an additional
term of five years, and an appropriate sentence for the malicious wounding, had
it stood
alone, to be one involving a minimum term in the order of six years,
with an additional term of two years.  It is against that background
that I
will sentence the prisoner.
<P>

79  	I have come to the conclusion that the proper course is to order
that the sentences be served concurrently, and that in order
to give proper
effect to the totality of the criminality involved, it is appropriate to deal
with the offence of malicious wounding
by a fixed term that will be absorbed in
the sentence for the offence of murder and to extend the latter sentence beyond
that which
I would otherwise regard as appropriate had it stood alone or had
the matter been dealt with on a basis of accumulation.  In the
light of those
principles and my assessment of the objective and subjective circumstances I
will proceed to sentence.  Stand up please,
Mr Hearne.
<P>

80  	Murray Walter Edward Hearne, for the offence of the malicious
wounding, to which you have pleaded guilty, I sentence you to
a fixed term of
penal servitude for six years to date from 3 March 1998, that being the date on
which you were first taken into custody.
 For the offence of murder, to which
you have pleaded guilty, I sentence you to a minimum term of penal servitude
for twenty years,
such sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence I
have just pronounced, that is to commence from 3 March 1998 and to expire
on 2
March 2018.  I further sentence you to an additional term of penal servitude
for seven years to commence upon expiry of the
minimum term.  The earliest date
on which you will be eligible for release on parole will accordingly be 2 March
2018.
<P>

81  	I specify, for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing
Act</a>, that the reasons for imposing a fixed term for the offence of malicious
wounding, relates to the circumstance that the two offences
were part of a
single episode, and to the further circumstance that the sentence for murder
must necessarily exceed that for the
offence of malicious wounding so that the
latter will be totally absorbed in the former.  In those circumstances there is
no reason
for an additional term.
<P>

82  	Finally, I observe that the age of the prisoner, the possibility
that by reason of his youth he may spend some time in protection,
and the
lengthy period of imprisonment that he must serve, as well as the desirability
of a lengthy period of supervision post-release
so as to facilitate his
eventual return to society, do constitute special circumstances within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
5(7)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>, and would permit a departure from the prima facie
proportion between the minimum and additional terms.  However, in this case, I
do not consider that a minimum term less than that I have determined is proper
and properly reflect the objective and subjective
criminality of the prisoner.
The additional term which I have rounded up to seven years, and which I have
adjudged appropriate, provides
in my view an adequate period for post-release
supervision.  I accordingly see no reason for, or utility in, any adjustment of
the
minimum and additional terms save for the minor extent to which the
additional term of seven years exceeds one-third of the minimum
term of twenty
years.  I observe in this regard that any further extension of the additional
term beyond seven years might, in fact,
work an unfairness to the prisoner
since it should not be overlooked that any breach of parole, during an
additional term, may lead
to the return of the prisoner for the remainder of
the additional term.
