<b><u>70077/97 - REGINA  v  JAY WILLIAM SHORT</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT - ON SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	
<P>

<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<P>

1	On 23 November 1998 Jay William Short, ["the prisoner"], was presented for
trial in this Court and upon an indictment containing
three counts.
<P>

2	The first count charged that the prisoner, on 2 March 1997 at Lithgow, had
murdered one Alison Marie Lewis. Such a crime contravenes
section 19A of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> (NSW)</b>, ["the Act"], and attracts a statutory maximum
penalty of penal servitude for the term of the offender's natural life.
<P>

3	The second count charged that the prisoner, on 2 March 1997 at Lithgow, had
robbed one Melanie Spillane of certain of her property,
namely a handbag
containing money and other personal items, and that he had used, at that time,
corporal violence on that victim.
Such a crime contravenes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s95.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 95</a> of the
Act and attracts a statutory maximum penalty of penal servitude for 20 years.
Where the particular corporal violence results
in an actual wounding of the
victim, or in the actual inflicting upon the victim of grievous bodily harm,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 96</a> of the Act increases the statutory maximum penalty to one of penal
servitude for 25 years. 
<P>

4	In the case of Mrs. Spillane, the corporal violence allegedly used against
her caused both wounding and grievous bodily harm;
and the normal endorsement
on the cover sheet of the indictment refers in fact to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 96</a> of the Act.
The count actually charged is framed, however, in terms appropriate to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s95.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
95</a> of the Act; and I proceed for present purposes upon the footing that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s95.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
95</a>, rather than <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 96</a>, is the correct point of statutory reference.
<P>

5	The third count charged that the prisoner, on 2 March 1997 at Lithgow, had
assaulted one Kerry Tonkin; had then beaten and otherwise
ill-treated her; and
had thereby occasioned to her actual bodily harm. Such a crime contravenes
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 59</a> of the Act; and attracts a statutory maximum penalty of penal
servitude for 5 years.
<P>

6	To each of the three charges thus preferred against him the prisoner pleaded
not guilty; and he was put, accordingly, upon trial
by jury. That trial
occupied the Court until 14 December 1998, on which day the jury returned
verdicts finding the prisoner guilty
as charged of all three of the offences
nominated in the indictment.
<P>

7	Proceedings on sentence were stood over to a date to be fixed; and were
listed, eventually, for hearing on 19 March 1999. On that
day evidence and
submissions on sentence were received; and the Court took time to consider what
action it would take.
<P>

8	While sentence was thus reserved, the Crown applied to re-open the
proceedings on sentence. This application came before the Court
on 9 April
1999, and was granted for certain stated, and limited, purposes. 
<P>

9	The re-opened proceedings on sentence came before the Court on 23 April 1999;
and certain supplementary evidence and submissions
on sentence were received.
Once again, the Court took time to consider what it would do in the matter of
sentence.
<P>

<b><u>The Relevant Facts</u></b>
<P>

10	Shortly after midnight on Saturday 1 March 1997, Miss Lewis, Miss Tonkin and
another friend went together to a night club in
Lithgow. There they met Mrs.
Spillane. The group of young women enjoyed themselves at the night club until
about 2.50 a.m. on the
Sunday morning. There had been talk among the people in
the group of walking to a nearby municipal pool and of there taking a swim.
Miss Lewis left the night club at about 2.50 a.m. About 10 minutes later Miss
Tonkin and Mrs. Spillane and another girlfriend left
the night club. They went
to the Lithgow Hotel; and then, having dropped off their friend at the hotel,
Miss Tonkin and Mrs. Spillane
began to walk back towards the night club, on
their way to the swimming pool. Their route took them to the vicinity of an
open area
of public recreation space known as the Watsford Oval. The area was
very dark; and the locality seems to have been practically deserted
and fairly
lonely. The two young women were carrying their shoes; and Mrs. Spillane was
carrying her handbag around her neck.
<P>

11	Suddenly, both young women were attacked from behind. Miss Tonkin felt
something <i>"across the back of my shoulders, like somebody had hit me or
thrown something at me"</i>. She heard, simultaneously, Mrs. Spillane cry out:
<i>"Who are you?"</i>. Miss Tonkin thereupon ran off as quickly as she could.
In effect, she circled the Watsford Oval, crying out for help; and she was
found, eventually, by a taxi-driver whom Mrs. Spillane had managed to reach
after having escaped from her assailant. 
<P>

12	Mrs. Spillane's own experience with her assailant was more prolonged. She
described it as follows in her evidence:
<P>

	"Q.	Just tell the Court what happened?
<P>

	A.	Someone hit me on the shoulder with something. I don't know what it was at
the time, and Kerrie ran. 
<P>

	Q.	What happened to you?
<P>

	A.	He grabbed me by the hair, and pulled me towards the oval.
<P>

	Q.	Were you hit anywhere else?
<P>

	A.	On the head.
<P>

	Q.	Were you hit on the head, or the shoulder first?
<P>

	A.	The shoulder.
<P>

	Q.	After that you were hit on the head?
<P>

	A.	Once he had hold of me he started hitting into my head.
<P>

	Q.	He had hold of your head?
<P>

	A.	Yeah, my hair.
<P>

	Q.	How were you held?
<P>

	A.	I was hunched over, and he had hold of the back of my hair, and was just
pulling me by the hair. 
<P>

	Q.	In which direction?
<P>

	A.	Towards the oval.
<P>

	Q.	Pulling your head down?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Were you doing anything? Were you saying anything?
<P>

	A.	Screaming. I don't really remember.
<P>

	Q.	You were screaming?
<P>

	A.	Yeah.
<P>

	Q.	As loud as you could?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	Was anything said?
<P>

	A.	No, he just told me to `shut up' many times.
<P>

	Q.	Sorry.
<P>

	A.	Many times.
<P>

	Q.	And pulling at you?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	Did you have a glimpse of anyone?
<P>

	A.	No.
<P>

	Q.	Did you see any person at all?
<P>

	A.	No, my head was down the whole time.
<P>

	Q.	But you could hear a male voice?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	You were being pulled towards the oval?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Is there a gutter there?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did you get pulled towards the gutter?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did you do something with the gutter?
<P>

	A.	Yes, I pushed my foot into it so he couldn't pull me any further, and I was
almost on the ground by that stage.
<P>

	Q.	Did something happen to your hair?
<P>

	A.	It come out, yep.
<P>

	Q.	The hair came out? What happened then?
<P>

	A.	I ran.
<P>

	Q.	Which way did you run?
<P>

	A.	Under the viaduct near the pool.
<P>

	Q.	That is under another viaduct which is near the pool?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	That is under the railway?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	It goes towards Main Street?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	You ran under there? Did you get to Main Street?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did you see a taxi?
<P>

	A.	Yes. 
<P>

	Q.	Did you hale (sic) the taxi?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Mrs. Morrison was the driver?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	What happened after that?
<P>

	A.	We went back under the viaduct. I told Mrs. Morrison what had happened, and
she phoned the police, and we went back looking
for Kerrie, because we didn't
know where she was at that stage.
<P>

	Q.	Did you drive to a spot which overlooks Watsford Oval?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did the lights of the cab shine across the oval?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	Could you see Kerrie?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	In the oval?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	Did she come over to the cab, you were screaming for her?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	She came over to the cab and got into the cab?
<P>

	A.	Yep.
<P>

	Q.	Did you then go to Lithgow Hospital?
<P>

	A.	Yes." <b>(Trial transcript 29 (43) - 31 (51)</b>
<P>

13	The handbag that Mrs. Spillane had been carrying was pulled off her and over
her head during the course of her struggle with
her assailant. The bag
contained at that time a small amount of money, probably no more than $10 or
thereabouts; and some other personal
items.
<P>

14	Neither Miss Tonkin nor Mrs. Spillane could give any very precise
description of their assailant.
<P>

15	Miss Tonkin suffered, as a result of the assault upon her, a sore back. Mrs.
Spillane suffered a nasty laceration to the back
of her head. The laceration
required some three stitches.
<P>

16	Miss Lewis' movements after she left the night club cannot be re-constructed
in any detail. It seems clear that Miss Lewis left
the night club shortly after
the departure from the club of a young local man named Michael Doalman. They
were acquainted, and they
had spent time, but it would seem no great time, in
each other's company at the night club. According to Mr. Doalman's evidence,
Miss Lewis attempted to persuade him to go with her for a swim at the municipal
pool, but he preferred to go home. She followed him
as he walked away from the
club; and both of them walked, hand in hand, towards a nearby hockey field.
They made their way to the
vicinity of a shed standing near the hockey field;
lay down together on the grass; and had sexual intercourse. Thereafter, they
went
their separate and opposite ways: he towards his home; she towards the
pool.
<P>

17	When the attack upon Mrs. Spillane and Miss Tonkin became known, a search
was made for Miss Lewis. As the search progressed through
the Sunday morning,
various blood-stained items of Miss Lewis' clothing were discovered.
Eventually, and a little after 2.30 p.m.,
her naked body was discovered. It was
buried in a sand pit forming part of some recreational facilities. Other
discarded items of
Miss Lewis' clothing were found nearby in bins. 
<P>

18	Post-mortem examination established that Miss Lewis had died from ligature
strangulation. Her body carried multiple traumatic
injuries, including an
injury which had been inflicted by <i>"an object with a linear edge"</i>,
<b>(trial transcript: Dr. Lawrence: 83(54) )</b>, and with such force as to
cause a perforation of the right ear-drum. There were, also, post-mortem drag
marks on the body. 
<P>

19	The Crown case against the prisoner on the charge of murder was based,
putting the matter very simply and broadly, upon the basis
of the combined
effect of inculpatory admissions made to the investigating police and to other
people; of inferences to be drawn
from the finding of a pubic hair of the
prisoner on Miss Lewis' skirt; and of the finding in two separate locations of
two pieces
of a stick, one piece of which was able to be related to the
injuries caused to Mrs. Spillane and Miss Tonkin; and the other piece
of which
was able to be related to the perforating injury to, and to the region of, Miss
Lewis' right ear.
<P>

20	The accused's case at trial can be summarised in the form of the following
adaptation of my summing up notes:
<P>

1.	He did not commit the murder; was not present when the murder was committed;
and took no active part whatsoever in connection
with the carrying out of the
murder. 
<P>

2.	He was present at the beginning of what proved to be the chain of events
culminating in the murder. But his only active involvement
in that initial
stage of events was to put his hand over Miss Lewis' mouth in order to stop her
from screaming out. 
<P>

3.	Thereafter he followed as she was led off by two men: one, a local man and a
friend of the prisoner, named Aaron Martin; and
the other a man known only as
`the tattooed man'. He continued to follow until the group reached the place
where the tattooed man
began to slap Miss Lewis' face. Disapproving of what was
going on, and craving some form of drug-shot, he remonstrated briefly and
ineffectually with the tattooed man, and then left that scene.
<P>

	4.	Thereafter he never saw Miss Lewis alive. When he returned to the relevant
spot he found her dead, and in the condition described
in his evidence.
<P>

	5.	Seeing that she was dead, he panicked and buried the body in the manner
described by him in his evidence. Thereafter he disposed
of Miss Lewis'
clothing, and the burial implements, also as described by him in his
evidence.
<P>

	6.	When arrested by the police and interviewed, he made incriminating
statements for the reasons that he feared that the police
would bash him; that
he was afraid of inculpating Aaron Martin and the unidentified tattooed man,
with consequent risk to his own
physical safety; and that he was attempting to
buy time until he could see his solicitor. 
<P>

	7.	He denies having made some of the apparently incriminating statements
attributed to him by various of the witnesses. 
<P>

	8.	He was, but in an exculpatory rather than an incriminating sense, the wrong
person in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<P>

21	The man Aaron Martin to whom reference is made in the foregoing summary was
called in the Crown case. His evidence was directed
not so much at inculpating
the prisoner, as in exculpating himself. It is, I think, clearly to be inferred
from the verdict of the
jury that the jury accepted to the required legal
standard the substance of the evidence of Aaron Martin, and did not accept the
substance of the contrary evidence of the prisoner.
<P>

	<b><u>The Objective Gravity of the Offences of which the Prisoner has been
found Guilty</u></b>
<P>

22	There is, I think, no need to dwell at length upon this topic. 
<P>

23	Miss Lewis was a young woman aged some 19 years. She was done to death in
the most cruel and wicked fashion. Her murder was,
in purely objective terms,
an appalling crime calling for uncompromising denunciation, and meriting severe
punishment. 
<P>

<u>24	</u>The offences committed against Miss Tonkin and Mrs. Spillane tend, in
the nature of things, to be overshadowed by the brutal killing
of Miss Lewis.
Those other offences were, however, by no means trivial examples of their
respective categories of crime. Had Miss
Tonkin not been lucky enough to get
away quickly from her assailant; had Mrs. Spillane not shown great tenacity and
presence of mind
in resisting her assailant; and had Mrs. Morrison, the taxi
driver, not come upon the scene when she did; and had she not thereupon
shown
prompt and practical good sense in her own responses; the consequences for
those two young women might have been much worse.
<P>

<u>	<b>The Relevant Subjective Features of the Prisoner's Case</b></u>
<P>

25	Some of these features can be established simply and readily.
<P>

26	<i> First</i>, the prisoner was born on 12 August 1975. He was aged,
therefore, 21 years and some 7 months at the date of the offences of which
he
has been found guilty; and he is now aged 23 years and some 9 months. He is
single. He has an ex-nuptial child aged about 16 months.

<P>

27	<i>Secondly</i>, the prisoner has criminal antecedents. Some of them have
violent aspects, but nothing remotely approaching the lethal violence done
to
Miss Lewis; or equating in any real way to the particular type of personal
violence done to Mrs. Spillane and to Miss Tonkin.

<P>

28	<i>Thirdly</i>, the prisoner has a seriously dysfunctional family and
personal history. It is not necessary, I think, to go over that history in
minute detail. Exhibits B, C, 1 and 2 on sentence present that detail in a
completely clear and a readily accessible fashion. It
suffices to say that the
picture thus painted is a bleak and saddening one. The focus of that picture is
sharpened, in my own view,
by the evidence given in the sentence proceedings by
the prisoner's father. The content of that evidence, but more significantly
the
way in which it was given, seem to me to be eloquent of the reality of what is
conveyed by the bare words of the documentary
exhibits.
<P>

29	<i>Fourthly</i>, there is in Exhibit 3 on sentence material in the nature of
school reports, other personal certificates of achievement, and various
personal references. This material suggests that the prisoner is not without
worthwhile personal capacities, provided only that he
is properly motivated to
realise them. 
<P>

30	It is not really possible to go with any confidence beyond the foregoing
matters; and that for reasons appearing in two reports
dated respectively 23
October 1998 and 22 January 1999, and prepared by Dr. Bruce Westmore, a
well-recognised Forensic Psychologist.
<P>

31	In the report of 23 October 1998 Dr. Westmore speaks in the following terms
of the prisoner's then mental state as he, Dr. Westmore,
perceived it in the
light of the examination which he conducted in connection with that report:
<P>

	"Mr. Short presented as a man who looked his stated years, he was pleasant and
cooperative. He maintained good eye contact and
he spoke spontaneously and
expansively. There was some intensity to his affect but he was not unduly
anxious I felt. He was not clinically
depressed and there was no evidence of
any psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations. He presented as
being of average
intelligence, he certainly was an alert and attentive
historian."
<P>

32	Later in this report, Dr. Westmore made the following observations
concerning his diagnosis of the then psychiatric condition
of the prisoner:
<P>

	"On psychiatric examination at this time there is no evidence that he is
suffering from any form of mental illness and nothing
in the history he
provides of the event itself which would suggest mental illness played any role
in the alleged offending behaviour.
There is also no information to suggest he
would have the defence of substantial impairment available to him on the
history he currently
provides."
<P>

33	In his later report dated 22 January 1999, Dr. Westmore describes as follows
part of the exchanges that he had, in connection
with the preparation of that
report, with the prisoner:
<P>

	"I asked him what his thoughts were now about this matter and he said he hopes
to get a re-trial. I asked him was he intending
to appeal and he said yes. I
asked him the basis of this but he could not say. 
<P>

	I asked Mr. Short was he maintaining his innocence in relation to the
offending behaviour and he responded in the affirmative."
<P>

34	Later in that same report, and with respect to his prognosis concerning the
prisoner, Dr. Westmore says:
<P>

	"This man's prognosis remains most uncertain, this because of the nature of
the offences and his current position regarding the
offences. By maintaining
his innocence of the charges it is not possible to assess any feelings of
regret and remorse he may have
for his actions nor indeed to make any comments
about his level of psychological insight and understanding into the processes
which
led up to the offending behaviour. To that extent his prognosis should be
considered in a guarded fashion at this time. 
<P>

	It is likely he has a personality disorder with anti-social traits and he
suffers substance abuse. He has little to no insight
into this latter
problem."
<P>

35	Because of the barriers to which Dr. Westmore refers in his later report, it
is very difficult to judge whether, as the Crown
has submitted, the prisoner
should be sentenced upon the basis that it can be found properly that the
available evidence shows him
to be psycopathic; and so, likely to repeat the
extreme violence of the crimes of which he has been found guilty.
<P>

36	Dr. Westmore was called to give evidence at the sentence proceedings. Part
of that evidence was the following:
<P>

	"Q.	He maintains, never mind for the moment whether correctly or not, that
there was no offence?
<P>

	A.	That's correct.
<P>

	Q.	Does that not then leave us in a situation where diagnosis, analysis and
prognosis that might have been rational upon the basis
of other premises simply
becomes speculative because there is no given basis from which one can
confidently argue it? Does that miss
something or is that correct?
<P>

	A.	That is essentially correct. The problem is that we cannot understand this
offence because he gives no history about it, so
it is hard to understand this
offence, even in the context of his personality, as we know it, with what we
already know about it.
We cannot understand how or why he committed this
offence because he gives no history about it and that does make things like
predicting
future dangerousness very difficult. 
<P>

	Q.	Well, impossible in truth?
<P>

	A.	Virtually it does, yes."
<P>

37	And later:
<P>

	"Q.	A person who gives way to base feelings, ................, or feelings of
cruelty to other human beings could, or is likely
to, give way again in the
future?
<P>

	A.	They may do. You need, probably, to answer the question fully, to
understand the circumstances of how the first incident occurred.
As I said
earlier, the major problem we have here is that he is not acknowledging it. He
is giving no account of his mental state
at the time or what he did or why he
did it, so it is very difficult to tell you, in Court, about things like his
future risk of
doing behaviour like this again.
<P>

	HIS HONOUR:		Q.	In truth, it is impossible?
<P>

	A.	Yes, it is.
<P>

	Q.	All that one can say about it is that he has, upon the basis of a reliable
and reliably conservative diagnosis, a personality
disorder of some kind?
<P>

	A.	Yes. 
<P>

	Q.	And, really, while he persists in denying that he had any involvement in
any one of the three of these offences, and denied
all three of them, that is
just an impenetrable barrier to going, logically, any further forward?
<P>

	A.	Pretty much."
<P>

38	I am not prepared to make such a finding as the Crown has submitted should
be made. I think that the preponderance of the evidence,
and in particular Dr.
Westmore's oral evidence, which I accept, is, on a fair view, to the
contrary.
<P>

<b><u>Should an Indeterminate Sentence be Imposed?</u></b>
<P>

39	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19A</a> of the Act is in the following terms:
<P>

	"(1)	A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to penal servitude for
life.
<P>

	(2)	A person sentenced to penal servitude for life for the crime of murder is
to serve that sentence for the term of the person's
natural life.
<P>

	(3)	Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 442 (which
authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than penal
servitude for life).
<P>

	(4)	This section applies to murder committed before or after the commencement
of this section."
<P>

40	In 1996, section 431B was added to the Act. So far as is at present
material, it is there provided:
<P>

	"(1)	A Court is to impose a sentence of penal servitude for life on a person
who is convicted of murder, if the Court is satisfied
that the level of
culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community
interest in retribution, punishment,
community protection and deterrence can
only be met through the imposition of that sentence."
<P>

41	The Attorney-General, in explaining this provision to Parliament, said:
<P>

	"The preservation of that discretion does no more than recognise the
possibility that a murder, which, on its face, demonstrates
an extreme degree
of criminality, may nevertheless call for something less than life
imprisonment. For this reason the discretion
to impose less than life remains,
although it is a discretion which cannot be lightly exercised in the face of
the principle expressed
in the Bill."
<P>

42	On 11 June 1998 I passed sentence in the matter of <b>Regina v Gary Zane
Glasby</b>. On that occasion I expressed the following views:
<P>

	"It is obvious that the imprisonment of an offender for the term of his
natural life is, to say the very least, a draconian punishment.
The existence
of such a penalty has excited strong, and sometimes passionate, responses from
individual Judges. An especially powerful
statement in that regard is that of
Allen J in his Honour's dissenting judgment in <b>R v Baker</b> (unreported,
CCA 20 September 1995). His Honour says:
<P>

	"In <b>Regina v Petroff </b>(unreported, 12 November 1991) Hunt CJ at CL
said:
<P>

	`In the Old Testament, in the second Book of Moses called Exodus, the author
laid down the law concerning acts of violence in these
terms:
<P>

	"And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye,
tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning
for burning, wound for
wound, stripe for stripe" (Ch 21 vv 23-25)
<P>

	It is, as I say, an understandable desire on the part of the victim or those
whom he or she leaves behind to have the law of Moses
applied. But we now live
in a civilised community. Winston Churchill, during a debate in the (UK) House
of Commons in 1910 said this:
<P>

	"The mood and tempo of the public with regard to the treatment of crime and
criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the
civilisation of any
country."
<P>

	Those words admirably express the basi approach which a judge in a civilised
country must take.
<P>

	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19A</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> 1900 empowers this Court to sentence a
person convicted of murder to penal servitude for life. That is what such
sentence, if imposed,
means. It means for life. It means that never can there
be any hope of release. It means never, no matter how many decades go by,
will
the prison door be opened and the prisoner be allowed out again. It matters not
whether he be sixty, seventy or survives to
eighty. He is there for life. Such
a sentence cannot lightly be imposed in any civilised society.
<P>

	There are, of course, circumstances in which in a civilised society such a
sentence may be called for. Such cases will be quite
exceptional. But clearly
they exist. The law so provides. It would be foolish in the extreme to attempt
to give a list of the types
of cases which would warrant the court taking this,
the most extreme measure available to the law. Three, however, stand out in
respect
of murder. The first is the case of the professional killer, the person
who cold-bloodedly assassinates others for gain. That is
one category. Another
is the case where the killer is so fundamentally psychotic that it could never
be safe to release him back
into the community. I may say that the evidence
that that is so would, as far as I am concerned, need to be quite strong. The
third
is the case of an offender who embarks on such a course of criminality
that nothing short of the knowledge that the most extreme
punishment the law
can give awaits him would deter him from continuing that course" [emphasis
added]."
<P>

43	In <b>Glasby </b> itself, I accepted the above statements of principle; and
I took the view that they warranted the imposition in that particular case
of
an indeterminate life sentence. I took that view because, on the given facts of
that case, the murder there in question had been
a cold-blooded contract
killing; and fell, therefore, within a category of murder such as was regarded,
even upon a conservative
judicial approach, as appropriate to attract the
indeterminate sentence.
<P>

44	Had I been persuaded in the present matter that there was credible evidence
capable, if accepted, of establishing, to quote again
the words of Allen J,
that<i> </i>the prisoner "<i>......is so fundamentally psychotic that it could
never be safe to release him back into the community"</i>, I would not have
hesitated to impose the indeterminate life sentence. But, as I have earlier
explained, I do not think that the
evidence to hand can possibly support so
grave a finding against the present prisoner. In saying so, I am not unmindful
of the grief
and anguish of the family of Miss Lewis. Their burden is a
terrible one; and nothing that this Court can say or do can possibly wipe
away
that level of pain or make good that level of loss.
<P>

45	Those considerations are powerful and they command rightly a proper respect
and acknowledgment; but they are no substitute for
concrete evidence sufficient
to justify the draconian view that nothing short of an indeterminate life
sentence will do justice in
the case of the present prisoner. As I have earlier
tried to explain, I do not think that the evidence is sufficient for that
purpose.
<P>

46	I regard it as self-evident that the present case calls for the imposition
of a significant sentence of penal servitude; but
I have not been persuaded
that nothing short of an indeterminate life sentence will give proper weight to
what is described in section
431B of the Act as <i>" ......... the community
interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence
.........."</i>. I can but reaffirm my conviction, expressed in other judgments
on other occasions, that the proper maintenance of the rule of law
requires,
particularly in cases of the present kind, a need to keep carefully in mind
that vindication is not the same thing as vindictiveness.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusions as to Sentence</u></b>
<P>

47	I have considered the various comparative materials that were placed before
me by both counsel. Such materials are, as always,
of broad, indicative value
only. Those materials suggest to me, however, that such is the gravity of the
crime committed against
Miss Lewis, that a fair balance of the relevant
objective and subjective factors in the prisoner's particular case is justly
measured
by an aggregate sentence of penal servitude for 20 years. I consider
that it should be divided between a minimum term of 16 years
and an additional
term of 4 years. I have considered the question of <i>"special
circumstances"</i> of the kind contemplated by section 5 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing
Act 1989</a> (NSW). </b>I think that it is possible to nominate various subjective
features of the prisoner's case that would be apt to fall within that
description;
but I am not persuaded that they point to any need for a period
longer than 4 years as being necessary to provide for the proper
rehabilitation
of the prisoner back into the general community should the Serious Offenders
Review Council consider that he is fit
for such conditional release at the
expiration of his minimum term. 
<P>

48	Such an approach and, as well, the principle of totality, make it expedient,
in my opinion, to deal with the offences committed
against Mrs. Spillane and
Miss Tonkin by the imposition, in each such case, of a fixed term of penal
servitude. In the case of the
offence committed against Mrs. Spillane, being
the more serious of the two offences, I consider that the proper fixed term is
one
of 5 years. In the case of the offence committed against Miss Tonkin, I
consider that the appropriate fixed term is one of 2 years.
<P>

49	All sentences will date from 3 March 1997, the day upon which the prisoner
first entered his present custody. 
<P>

50	Jay William Short, in respect of the crime of murder of which you have been
found guilty by the jury you are convicted. You are
sentenced to penal
servitude for 20 years. That sentence is apportioned between a minimum term of
16 years and an additional term
of 4 years. The minimum term will commence on 3
March 1997 and will expire on 2 March 2013. The additional term will commence
on
3 March 2013.
<P>

51	In respect of the charge of robbery with corporal violence, you are
convicted and sentenced to penal servitude for a fixed term
of 5 years to
commence on 3 March 1997 and to expire on 2 March 2002.
<P>

52	In respect of the crime of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, you are
convicted and sentenced to penal servitude for a fixed
term of 2 years to
commence on 3 March 1997 and expiring on 2 March 1999.
