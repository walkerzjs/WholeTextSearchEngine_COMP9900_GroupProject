<b>MICHAEL FRANCIS NANKERVIS  v  ULAN COAL MINES LIMITED AND ANOTHER</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff has, in this matter, sought orders
that the jury be dispensed with, and that the cross-claims, brought
by the two
defendants against each other, be heard separately from the action that the
plaintiff has brought against them.
<P>

2  	The proceedings concern a claim for damages for personal injuries
sustained by the plaintiff on 2 February 1997, when a wheel
rim fitted to a
shuttle car, used in the coal mine of the first defendant, failed, causing him
to be struck by a steel flange.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff has framed his claim against the first defendant
for breach of the duty of care owed to him by that party as his
employer, both
in tort and pursuant to a term implied in the contract of employment.
<P>

4  	The claim against the second defendant is brought for breach of
the duty of care it is alleged to have owed, as a party engaged
under a
contract with the first defendant, to supply, service and carry out repairs to
the tyres and wheels fitted to the machinery
used by the first defendant in its
mine.
<P>

5  	The first defendant has pleaded that the plaintiff is guilty of
contributory negligence.  The second defendant has not pleaded
such defence.
Each defendant, however, has placed its own liability in issue.  It is
understood, from the submissions addressed on
the motion this morning, that
each seeks to pass the blame to the other.  In that regard the first defendant
has foreshadowed that
it proposes to argue that the non delegable duty of care,
vested in it as employer, was discharged by engaging an experienced contractor
in the relevant area.
<P>

6  	The first defendant has brought a cross-claim against the second
defendant for contribution or indemnity.  Such claim is pursued
upon the basis
of the alleged liability of that party as a tort feasor under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946</a>.  Additionally, reliance is placed upon an
express indemnity provision said to arise by contract, as well as upon alleged
breaches
of terms as to performance, fitness of purpose and merchantability,
either arising expressly or impliedly under terms of the contract,
or under
section 70(1)(i) and section 70(1)(ii) of the Trade Practices Act.
<P>

7  	The second defendant has, similarly, brought a cross-claim for
contribution or indemnity against the first  defendant, based
upon the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946</a>.  
<P>

8  	In the result, a jury would be expected to consider issues
concerning liability:
<P>

(a) so far as the plaintiff seeks to establish negligence against the first and
second defendants respectively as an employee, and
as a person to whom the
neighbour principle extends;
<P>

(b) so far as the plaintiff seeks to establish against the first defendant a
breach of his contract of employment;
<P>

(c) so far as the first defendant seeks to establish against the second
defendant its negligence and its breach of express terms,
as well as of terms
said to have been implied into the contract between those parties;
<P>

(d) so far as the second defendant seeks to establish against the first
defendant its negligence;
<P>

(e) so far as the first defendant seeks to establish contributory negligence on
the part of the plaintiff and
<P>

(f) so far as the two defendants seek to apportion responsibility between
themselves.
<P>

9  	Apart from the complexity inherent in the several questions thus
raised, the jury would also be expected to make an assessment
of damages on two
separate bases including:
<P>

(a) those arising at Common Law as modified by the Workers' Compensation Act,
so far as the plaintiff's claim is brought against
the first defendant for
breach of the duty of care said to arise, either at general law or under
contract, and
<P>

(b) those arising at Common Law, so far as the plaintiff's claim is brought
against the second defendant.
<P>

10  	Threshold questions, and somewhat complex calculations will
arise in relation to damages to be assessed under the workers'
compensation
legislation.  Additionally, some threshold questions of fact will need to be
answered by the jury, dependent upon which
findings, directions of law would
then need to be given as to the implication of terms into the contract alleged
by the first defendant,
upon the basis of which it claims contribution or
indemnity.
<P>

11  	The case is one in which some issues will fall for determination
upon expert evidence as to the cause of the accident, and
as to the precautions
available, in relation to the proper fitting of tyre and wheel components to
heavy machinery of the kind involved.
 This would extend to an examination of
the extent to which the first defendant could properly discharge its duty of
care by engaging
external experts.
<P>

12  	The problems are somewhat complicated by the contributory
negligence defence, particularly having regard to the recent decision
of the
High Court in <u>Astley v Austrust Ltd</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 6</a>, which might lead to a
different assessment of damages against the first defendant, compared to the
assessment against the second
defendant dependent upon whether the plaintiff's
claim was made out in tort or contract or both.  A flow on in relation to the
cross-claims
could be quite significant, having regard to the potential
different bases for liability and apportionment between the two defendants.
<P>

13  	The case is one, I observe, where a jury has been sought by the
first defendant.  The proceedings were included in a circuit
list at the Dubbo
sittings of the Court for which the 1999 court calendar allowed one week.  The
defendants informed the registrar
at a callover that as a jury trial, in which
all matters were at issue, the likely estimate for hearing would be ten days.
The matter
is listed in the September 1999 sittings of the Court at Dubbo and
because of its position in the list it could confidently be expected
to be
reached early in those sittings.  In accordance with the listing practice,
however, a case of ten days duration would normally
be regarded as a long case,
and transferred to Sydney to be included in the long cases list.  Upon that
basis, if these proceedings
were to be transferred because of that estimate,
then the plaintiff would be deprived of all opportunity for a hearing this
year.
<P>

14  	The defendants have properly placed before me the fact that the
plaintiff is back at work and, therefore, is not suffering
an immediate
financial loss.  That is a matter which I properly take into account, but it
does not provide a total answer to the
problem identified since, absent a
hearing, the plaintiff would be deprived of an early opportunity to pursue his
claim for general
damages.
<P>

15  	The discretion which arises to discharge a jury is not at large.
The principles have been recently discussed in <b>Pambula  District Hospital v
Herriman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 387</a> and more recently in<b> Forbes Service
Memorial Club Limited v Hodge</b>, Court of Appeal NSW, 8 March 1995.  The
effect of the decision of<b> Pambula District Hospital </b> is to exclude, as
irrelevant, considerations concerning general listing requirements and
management by the Court of its list.
<P>

16  	An application such as the present needs to be confined to
circumstances peculiar to the instant case.  I observe in this regard
that it
would be inappropriate on the state of current authority to lay down, as a
general principle, that cases included in circuit
lists of the Court should
proceed without a jury.  That would be a significant erosion of the right to a
jury trial and, as a general
principle, it would be an inappropriate basis from
which to commence.  I place that question, accordingly, to one side and confine
myself to the particular circumstances of the present case.
<P>

17  	I observe that apart from the experts who are to be called on
the issue of liability, there are a number of medical practitioners,
six in
number, who the plaintiff expects to call, some of whom are treating doctors
from the Mudgee or Lithgow area.  As a jury trial,
their personal attendance
will be required, whereas in a non jury trial their evidence could be taken, at
least in the first instance,
by the tender of their reports.  If the case has
to be moved to Sydney because of its length, they will be inconvenienced and
the
costs of the trial will be increased.
<P>

18  	I am satisfied, having regard to the multiple issues involved in
this case, that the length of the trial would be significantly
increased if it
were to proceed as a jury trial, with the consequence that the fixture will
almost certainly have to be vacated and
the matter either transferred to Sydney
or, subject to other considerations, given a special fixture at some later
time.  That could
not be achieved this year and, as a consequence, the
plaintiff would suffer delay on that account.
<P>

19  	However, the more significant and critical aspect, so far as I
am concerned, is the complexity of the issues which arise. 
I am satisfied that
the nature of those issues when combined is such that the matter could not be
conveniently or properly determined
by the jury.  Accordingly, I make an order
dispensing with the jury. 
<P>

20  	I am not persuaded that if the matter proceeds without a jury it
is necessary to hive off the questions of indemnity or contribution.
 It
appears to me that they are intrinsically linked to the plaintiff's case,
although some additional evidence might be expected
to be called in relation to
the circumstances in which any contractual arrangement between the parties were
established.  Those matters,
I believe, can be conveniently heard during the
Dubbo sittings in a non jury trial.  Accordingly, I decline to separate the
issues
arising on the cross-claims.
<P>

21  	The orders of the Court, accordingly, are the jury will be
dispensed with and I will reserve the costs.
<P>
