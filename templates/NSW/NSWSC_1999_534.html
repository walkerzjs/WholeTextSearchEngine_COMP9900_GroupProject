<b>13988/98	PHILIP JOHN RAPSON &amp; ANOR v WILLIAM EDWIN WRIGHT &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	In these proceedings I made orders on 19 December 1997 that
there be a permanent stay of proceedings on two informations in
the Local Court
at Sutherland and subsequently gave reasons for my orders.  Costs of the
proceedings in the Supreme Court were awarded
against the defendants, following
the event of the proceedings.  The formal substantive orders made were simply
that the proceedings
on the informations be permanently stayed.  Those orders
were formally entered on 13 October 1998.  Essentially the basis on which
I
ordered that the proceedings in the Local Court be permanently stayed was that
those proceedings had been brought for an improper
or inappropriate purpose,
being a purpose other than the due enforcement of the criminal law and were
consequently an abuse of proceedings.
 Subsequently, the plaintiffs in these
proceedings have brought proceedings in the District Court for malicious
prosecution based
upon the laying of those informations in the Local Court.
Those proceedings are shortly for trial in the District Court.  The defendants
in those proceedings are propounding, amongst others, the defence that the
proceedings for malicious prosecution must fail because
the orders for
permanent stay did not amount to a determination of the proceedings on the
informations in favour of the defendants
in those proceedings, a precondition
to the success of an action for malicious prosecution.
<P>

2   	Under the present motion the plaintiffs initially sought
that I should vary or add to the orders I made by way of permanent
stay by
ordering that, in the proceedings in the Local Court, the informations be
dismissed.  I am of the view that, on the present
state of the law, this Court
cannot make orders for dismissal in the Local Court.  A contrary view was
expressed by Brennan J in<b> Ridgeway v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 19</a>, but
was not the view of the majority of the High Court in that case.  The very
reason for the orders of this Court being by way
of permanent stay is that the
proceedings on the informations are not in this Court but in the Local Court;
no ground for a certiorari
was established which would have permitted the
proceedings to be removed into this Court, whereupon this Court would have had
the
power to make orders in those proceedings; and the orders by way of
permanent stay were the way of dealing with the situation.  The
present
plaintiffs have applied in the Local Court to have the proceedings upon the
informations dismissed, but the Magistrate has
declined to do this, in my view
correctly, on the basis that, the proceedings being permanently stayed by order
of this Court, he
could or ought do nothing whatever in the proceedings.
Likewise the present plaintiffs, at the time of asking for the orders of
dismissal
in the Local Court, asked the Local Court to order the costs of those
proceedings in their favour upon dismissal, and the Magistrate
refused that
application for like reason.
<P>

3   	However, the main thrust of debate in this case has come to
be, whether the Court has power, bearing in mind that its earlier
orders have
been entered, to lift the stay in part in order to permit the matter to be
dealt with further in the Local Court, and
whether, if it has such power, that
power ought in this Court's discretion be exercised to make such an order.  Mr
Lakatos, of counsel
for the first and second defendants, has made supplementary
written submissions which address these questions and which have been
particularly helpful.  It is conceded on behalf of the first and second
defendants that the Court does have power to lift a permanent
stay and in that
regard reference is made to <b>Nicholas v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 456</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=151%20ALR%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">151
ALR 312</a>, see per Brennan CJ at [41]; and Hayne J at [255].  The power to lift
the permanent stay was, in that case, conceded.  However, for
the reasons there
stated, it seems to me that the concession made in that case was correct and
that the concession made on behalf
of the first and second defendants in this
case by Mr Lakatos was correct and inevitable.
<P>

4   	The question therefore becomes one of whether the
discretion to lift the stay <i>pro tanto </i>should in this case be exercised.
It seems to me that the correct view of the discretion is that it is at large.
It must, of course,
be exercised judicially, but there are no particular
criteria upon which it should be exercised or preconditions to its exercise.
 I
should say that if it were a necessary precondition to its exercise, that there
should have been a change in circumstances since
the making of the original
order (as was provided in <b>Nicholas </b>by the legislative abolition of the
difficulty which had led to the permanent stay being granted in the first
place), then I should
find that there was a relevant change of circumstances in
the present case which would justify the partial lifting of the stay in
that,
upon malicious prosecution proceedings being brought in the District Court, the
defendants have pleaded in that Court that
there was a defence available to
them that the proceedings in the Local Court had not been determined in favour
of the defendants
in those proceedings. This was a subject matter certainly not
contemplated by this Court when original orders were made in December
 1997.
However, it seems to me that there is also a different basis upon which the
discretion may be exercised in the same sense,
although arising from the same
subject matter, that is, that the basis of the jurisdiction to grant permanent
stays is a jurisdiction
that is intended to prevent injustice arising.  The
jurisdiction which was exercised in the present case is a jurisdiction not in
respect of proceedings in this Court, but a supervisory jurisdiction over
inferior tribunals which do not themselves have power to
grant permanent stays
or do not stay the proceedings before them.  The supervision is exercised to
ensure that justice is done. 
Justice, in my view, would not be done by this
Court's orders if they were left in such a state as to prevent the dismissal by
the
Magistrate of the informations before him which, since they cannot proceed
and cannot succeed, ought, in my view, be dismissed, particularly
since there
is an issue estoppel between the plaintiffs in this Court and the informant in
those proceedings that the laying of the
informations in the Local Court was an
abuse of process.  Often it will make no practical difference whether criminal
proceedings
are dismissed or permanently stayed, but here, where the rights of
the parties may vary depending on whether the criminal proceedings
are or are
not dismissed, the dismissal of proceedings which cannot and ought not succeed
ought be facilitated.  I therefore propose
to order that the permanent stays be
varied so far as is necessary to permit the Local Court to dismiss the
informations before it.
 It was at the heel of the hunt contended before me
that there could be no dismissal of the informations in the Local Court by
reference
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s80.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 80</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>.  That contention does not appear to
be correct, although it should be said that it has not been fully argued before
me.
<P>

5   	The question of costs in the Local Court is perhaps, in a
sense, different.  Certainly there are cases in this Court to which
Mr Lakatos
has drawn attention, including <b>Kable v DPP</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/95.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 95</a>, where, costs
having been overlooked at the time of substantive orders being made, the Court
in its discretion refused subsequently
to make orders for costs.  In that case,
however, the costs under consideration were the costs of the proceedings in the
Supreme
Court, which have, of course, in this case been already dealt with.
Costs in the Local Court did not arise at the time the substantive
orders were
made in this Court, and, indeed, could not and cannot arise in the Local Court,
until an order of dismissal has been
made.  Whilst, if the application were for
a lifting of the stay to deal with costs alone, the result might be different,
in my view,
since the occasion for costs in the Local Court does not arise
until the orders of dismissal are made in that Court, it is appropriate
that
that matter also now be allowed to be agitated in the Local Court when orders
for dismissal of the informations are made.  The
order that I propose to make,
therefore, is that the permanent stay granted in respect of each of the
informations referred to in
my earlier order be lifted so far and only in so
far as is necessary to permit the Local Court to dismiss the said informations
and
to hear and determine an application by the defendant named in each
information for an order in respect of the costs of the proceedings
in the
Local Court.  I shall order that the first and second defendants pay the
plaintiffs' costs of this motion.
