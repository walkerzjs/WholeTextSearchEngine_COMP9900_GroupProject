<b><u>3041/99 FLAGSTAFF INVESTMENTS PTY LTD v CROSS STREET INVESTMENTS PTY
LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Question for decision</b>
<P>

1   	This action requires the court to determine whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a>
of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a></u> bears upon the entitlement of a lessee to a
new lease pursuant to an option where a breach of covenant occurs after notice
of exercise
is given.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	Flagstaff Investments Pty Ltd (Flagstaff) is the lessee of
shop 24 in the Georges Centre in Cross Street Double Bay, pursuant
to lease
registered number 20804448.  That lease as originally granted was in respect of
part of the land in Certificate of Title
Vol 15247 Folio 68.  It appears that
property must have been subject to a strata sub-division as the evidence shows
that the leased
premises are now Lot 16 in Strata Plan 53877, being Folio
Identifier 16/SP53877, but nothing turns on that.  The title search shows
the
whole of that lot to be subject to the lease to Flagstaff.  The defendant Cross
Street Investments Pty Limited (Cross Street)
was not the original lessor under
the lease; it purchased the premises subject to the leases in 1996.
<P>

3   	The lease was for a period of five years, commencing on 24
June 1994 with an option for a further period of five years.  The
lease
provided that the leased premises could only be used as commercial premises for
the purpose of carrying on the business described
in Item 4 of the Reference
Schedule.  That limited the use to "showrooms, salerooms, storage rooms and
offices relating to the sale
of ladies' clothing and accessories and art
gallery."
<P>

4   	The lease incorporated the provisions set out in a filed
Memorandum number T627856.  The provisions relating to the option
and its
exercise are set out in Clause 18 of that Memorandum.  So far as is relevant
the Clause provides:
<P>

18.1	If the Lessee shall desire to take a renewed lease of the demised premises
for the further term of years specified in Item
7 of the Reference Schedule
computed from the expiration of the lease and shall give to the Lessor not less
than six (6) months'
previous notice in writing thereof and shall during the
term duly and punctually pay the rent reserved by the lease at the times
hereinbefore appointed for payment thereof and shall duly observe and perform
the covenants and agreements by and on the part of
the Lessee expressed or
implied in the Lease up to the expiration of the term of the Lease the Lessor
shall at the cost and expense
of the Lessee grant to the Lessee a renewed lease
for a further terms of years so specified upon the same terms and conditions as
are herein contained but excluding this Clause 18 ...
<P>

5   	By letter dated 15 December 1998, Flagstaff gave formal
notice of exercise of option as follows:
<P>

Flagstaff Investments Pty Ltd being the lessee of shop 24 in the Georges
Centre, 45-51 Cross Street, Double Bay, pursuant to registered
lease number
2080448 hereby gives formal written notice of exercise of option pursuant to
clause 18 of the memorandum T627856.
<P>

Signed:	(Seal)
<P>

Date:		15/12/98
<P>

6   	It is not suggested that this does not fulfil the notice
requirements of Clause 18.  
<P>

7   	On three occasions in March 1999, real estate auctions were
held in the showroom in the leased premises, these being conducted
by Di Jones
Real Estate.  It seems from the evidence these were intended to be weekly
evening events for a fee of $750 per week.
 It was admitted at the commencement
of the hearing before me that allowing such activity was a breach of covenant
under the lease.
 In those circumstances it is not really necessary to discuss
further the particular provisions said to have been breached.  Mr Teplitsky,
the managing director of Cross Street, became aware of the proposed use of the
premises for auctions through advertisements in the
Wentworth Courier and in
fact attended the auction which was held on 17 March 1999.
<P>

8   	On 22 March 1999 the solicitor for Cross Street sent a
notice of breach of covenant and intention to re-enter pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a></u>.  This notified various breaches of lease terms
and required the unauthorised activities to cease by 29 March 1999, in default
of
which the lessor gave notice of intended re-entry.
<P>

9   	By letter of 29 March 1999, the solicitor for Flagstaff
denied there was any breach, but stated that nevertheless none of the
matters
or conduct alleged to constitute a breach would continue.  There is no claim of
any further breach.  By letter of 31 March
1999, the lessor's solicitor wrote
reiterating the claim of breach and said that "having regard to these breaches
the lessor will
not be granting any renewal of the lease under Clause 18 and is
unwilling to give effect to the lessee's notice of exercise of option
dated 15
December 1998."  The letter sought confirmation that the premises would be
vacated by 23 June 1999.
<P>

10   	As a result of negotiations the defendant agreed not to
re-enter provided these proceedings were commenced by 7 July 1999,
which was
done by summons filed on that day.
<P>

<b>Claims</b>
<P>

11   	By amended summons filed at the commencement of the
hearing, the plaintiff seeks:
<P>

1.	A declaration it validly exercised the option for a new lease, either on or
about 23 June 1999, or on or about 15 December 1998.
<P>

2.	An order for specific performance of the option agreement provisions.
<P>

3.	Orders restraining re-entry.
<P>

4.	Further or other relief.
<P>

It was accepted that notice was given that the plaintiff would claim that it
intended to apply for relief against forfeiture of
the right to renew under
this last head.
<P>

12   	The main claim of the plaintiff under 1 and 2 above is
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a></u> operates so as to prevent the
defendant from refusing to grant a new lease.  This is the principal matter for
decision.  By cross-claim
the defendant seeks possession.  It is accepted that
if the plaintiff fails, then an order for possession should be made.
<P>

<b>The law and the Act</b>
<P>

13   	In <b><cite>Gilbert J McCaul (Aust) Pty Ltd v Pitt Club
Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%2059%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 59 SR (NSW) 122</a>, the full court considered an option
which was in terms almost identical with the clause under consideration here.
The court held
that such a provision was an irrevocable offer to grant a
lease:
<P>

In the present case the lessor irrevocably offered to grant a lease.  Its offer
prescribed the time and manner for acceptance. 
Only by performing the
conditions prescribed could it be accepted and result in an agreement for a
lease.  A purported acceptance
without performance of the prescribed conditions
would not and could not be an acceptance of the offer.  It would be in reality
be
a counter offer by the original offeree requiring acceptance by the original
offeror if an agreement were to result. (p123)
<P>

14   	There is of course a continuing controversy as to whether
an option ought to be considered as an irrevocable offer or a contract
subject
to conditions.  Mr Hutley, senior counsel for the plaintiff accepted that I
should follow the decision in <b><cite>McCaul</cite></b> and was indeed bound
to do so, but I note that he reserved his right to argue the contrary on any
appeal.  I proceed on that basis.
 In my view there can be no doubt that I am
bound by <b><cite>McCaul</cite></b>.
<P>

15   	What was decided in <b><cite>McCaul</cite></b> was that
the observance and performance of the covenants and agreements in the lease was
a condition precedent to the right to exercise
the irrevocable offer so that
any breach by way of non-observance or non-performance at any time during the
term of the original
lease, whether or not complaint was made at the time, was
sufficient to prevent the tenant's entitlement or right to a new lease
pursuant
to the option.  It appears that it was at least partly as a result of this
decision that a reference was given to the New
South Wales Law Reform
Commission, which resulted in its report on <u>Options in Leases</u> (LRC5
1968) which in turn gave rise to amendments to the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></u> in
1972.  The relevant sections for consideration here are <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> which are as
follows:
<P>

133E.	Breach of certain obligations not to preclude lessee from exercising
option except in certain circumstances 
<P>

(1)	In this Division "prescribed notice" means a notice in writing that: 
<P>

(a)	specifies an act or omission, and 
<P>

(b)	states that, subject to any order of the court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133f.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133F</a>, a lessor
giving the notice proposes to treat that act or omission as having precluded a
lessee on whom the notice is served from
exercising an option contained in the
lease. 
<P>

(2)	Where an act or omission that constituted a breach by a lessee of the
lessee's obligations under a lease containing an option
would, but for this
section, have had the effect of precluding the lessee from exercising the
option, the act or omission shall be
deemed not to have had that effect where
the lessee purports to exercise the option unless, during the period of
fourteen days next
succeeding the purported exercise of the option, the lessor
serves on the lessee prescribed notice of the act or omission and: 
<P>

(a)	an order for relief against the effect of the breach in relation to the
purported exercise of the option is not sought from
the court before the
expiration of the period of one month next succeeding service of the notice, or

<P>

(b)	where such relief is so sought: 
<P>

(i)	the proceedings in which the relief is sought are disposed of, in so far as
they relate to that relief, otherwise than by granting
relief, or 
<P>

(ii)	where relief is granted upon terms to be complied with by the lessee
before compliance by the lessor with the order granting
relief, the lessee
fails to comply with those terms within the time stipulated by the court for
the purpose.
<P>

133F.	Court may grant relief from breach of certain obligations 
<P>

(1)	Relief referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133E</a> may be sought: 
<P>

(a)	in proceedings instituted in the court for the purpose, or 
<P>

(b)	in proceedings in the court in which: 
<P>

(i)	the existence of an alleged breach by the lessee of the lessee's
obligations under the lease, or 
<P>

(ii)	the effect of the breach from which relief is sought, 
<P>

is in issue. 
<P>

(2)	The court may, in proceedings in which relief referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133E</a>
is sought: 
<P>

(a)	make such orders (including orders affecting an assignee of the reversion)
as it thinks fit for the purpose of granting the
relief sought, or 
<P>

(b)	refuse to grant the relief sought. 
<P>

(3)	The court may, in proceedings referred to in subsection (2), take into
consideration: 
<P>

(a)	the nature of the breach complained of, 
<P>

(b)	the extent to which, at the date of the institution of the proceedings, the
lessor was prejudiced by the breach, 
<P>

(c)	the conduct of the lessor and the lessee, including conduct after the
giving of the prescribed notice, 
<P>

(d)	the rights of persons other than the lessor and the lessee, 
<P>

(e)	the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133G</a>, and 
<P>

(f)	any other circumstances considered by the court to be relevant. 
<P>

(4)	The court: 
<P>

(a)	may make an order under subsection (2) on such terms as to costs, damages,
compensation or penalty, or on such other terms,
as the court thinks fit, and

<P>

(b)	may make any consequential or ancillary order it considers necessary to
give effect to an order made under that subsection.

<P>

133G.	Lease to continue in force until issue decided 
<P>

(1)	Subject to any order of the court and to this section: 
<P>

(a)	where: 
<P>

(i)	an option is contained in a lease, 
<P>

(ii)	the lessee exercises, or purports to exercise, the option, and 
<P>

(iii)	the lease would, but for this paragraph, expire within the period of
fourteen days after the exercise, or purported exercise,
of the option, 
<P>

the lease shall be deemed to continue in force until the expiration of that
period, 
<P>

(b)	where: 
<P>

(i)	a prescribed notice is duly served on a lessee, and 
<P>

(ii)	the lease in respect of which the notice is served would, but for this
paragraph, expire within the period of one month referred
to in paragraph (a)
of subsection (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133E</a>, 
<P>

the lease shall be deemed to continue in force until the expiration of that
period, and 
<P>

(c)	where, in relation to a lease continued in force under paragraph (b),
relief referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133E</a> is sought by a lessee, the lease shall,
subject to subsections (2) and (3), be deemed to continue in force until: 
<P>

(i)	the proceedings in which the relief is sought are disposed of, in so far as
they relate to that relief, otherwise than by granting
the relief, or 
<P>

(ii)	effect is given to orders made by the court in granting that relief in so
far as they affect the lessor or relate to an assurance
to the lessee. 
<P>

(2)	Paragraph (c) of subsection (1): 
<P>

(a)	does not apply to or in respect of a lease that, but for that paragraph,
would continue in force for a period longer than the
period for which it is, by
the operation of that paragraph, continued in force, and 
<P>

(b)	does not, where a lessee fails to comply with terms imposed upon the lessee
pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (4) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133f.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 133F</a>, operate to
continue the lease in force beyond the time of that failure by the lessee. 
<P>

(3)	Where, under subsection (1), a lease continues in force after the day on
which, but for that subsection, it would expire: 
<P>

(a)	the lease so continues in force subject to the provisions, stipulations,
covenants, conditions and agreements in the lease (other
than those relating to
the term and the option contained in the lease) but without prejudice to any
rights or remedies of the lessor
or lessee in relation to the lease, and 
<P>

(b)	the lessee, if the lease is of land under the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act 1900</a> and the lessee is in possession of the demised premises, has
the protection of paragraph (d) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 42</a> of that Act as if the lease were
a tenancy referred to in that paragraph. 
<P>

(4)	Subject to subsection (5), where, pursuant to an option contained in a
lease continued in force under subsection (1), the lease
is renewed or a new
lease is granted, the period during which the lease was so continued in force
shall be deemed to be part of the
term for which the lease was renewed or the
new lease granted, and any lease granted pursuant to an exercise of the option
shall
be expressed to have commenced when the lease containing the option
would, but for subsection (1), have expired. 
<P>

(5)	Subsection (4) does not apply to or in respect of a lease that stipulates
for the commencement of any lease granted pursuant
to an exercise of the option
contained therein on a day that is later than the day on which the lease so
granted would, but for this
subsection, commence under subsection (4).
<P>

16   	The question for determination here is the impact of s133E
on breaches of covenant which occur after notice of intention or
desire to take
a renewed lease is given, but prior to the expiration of the term of the
original lease.  It has been necessary to
set out the legislation in detail to
explain my decision.
<P>

17   	This is a matter which is the subject of conflicting
decisions by single judges of this court.  In <b><cite>Beca Developments Pty
Ltd v Idameneo (No. 92) Pty Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) NSW ConvR. 55-459</a>, Young J
held that the particular option provision he was considering did not amount to
an irrevocable offer subject to condition
precedent for acceptance, but was
such that when notice of exercise was given:
<P>

equitable rights came into existence entitling the lessee to a new lease from 1
July 1988, but there was a condition of forfeiture,
that if at 30 June 1988
there were breaches of the lease, then the right to get a new lease would be
forfeited.
<P>

There can be no doubt that the construction that notice gave rise to rights was
open upon the wording of the clause under consideration
and I do not think that
further consideration need be given to that part of the decision.  Young J was
not departing from <b><cite>McCaul</cite></b>; the different facts brought
forth a different interpretation of the rights arising under the option,
although with respect, I do
not agree with his conclusions as to the nature of
the rights on notice of exercise.  In view of the conclusion I have come to as
to the proper construction of the particular clause in question, on one basis
there is no need for me to consider in any detail,
the conclusion of Young J
based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></u> when read with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s128</a> which makes
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> applicable to an agreement for lease in certain circumstances.   However,
as Hodgson J, in the next case to which I refer, seemed
to accept the
conclusions of Young J on this point it is better to deal with them.

18   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 128</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></u> provides that
for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> of the Act "lease" includes an "agreement for lease
where the lessee has become entitled to have his lease granted".  As I
understand
his decision, Young J held that the rights referred to in paragraph
17 amounted to an agreement for lease subject to forfeiture in
the event of
breach of the original lease prior to termination, that being a condition
subsequent to entitlement to a lease.  It
follows he said that in the absence
of notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a>, the breach could not be relied upon.
<P>

19   	In my respectful opinion, the more correct view is that on
the wording of the option provision in <b><cite>Beca</cite></b>, and accepting
some conditional contract as arising on notice of exercising of option, what
came into existence was an agreement
for lease, the rights to a lease or
performance being conditional upon performance of the covenants of the original
lease to its
end.  In other words, fulfilment of the covenants was a condition
precedent to the right to a lease under the agreement.  In such
circumstances,
in the event of breach the agreement for lease was not a "lease" under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> of
the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></u> because the lessee never became entitled to have
the lease granted:  it was not a matter of forfeiture:  <b><cite>Greville v
Parker</cite></b> [1910] AC 335.

20   	Young J in <b><cite>Hayes v Gunbola Pty Ltd </cite></b>

agreement for lease where the lessee has become entitled to have his lease
granted".
 He came to the conclusion that the words should be read as having
the words "had there been no forfeiture" inserted after the word
"entitled".
This accords with the view in Stuckey, The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> 2nd ed Law Book
Company, Sydney (1969) para 590 and notes to that section and also conforms to
the decision in <b><cite>Greville</cite></b>.  As an alternative he considered
the words could refer to a situation where a lessee had entered into possession
and paid rent under
the agreement and had become entitled to have the lease
granted, although there may have been some subsequent breach.  The latter
case
of course envisages the term as having commenced and in my opinion, so does the
former.

relevance otherwise.  Forfeiture under that section

consider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> has anything to say about breach of a condition precedent to

22   	In <b><cite>Nessmine Pty Ltd v Devuzo Pty Ltd</cite></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d496" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] NSW ConvR. 55-496</a>, Hodgson J was dealing with a lease containing an
option clause to all intents and purposes identical with that in
<b><cite>McCaul</cite></b> and the one in the present case.  The term of that
lease expired on 17 or 18 August 1989.  The notice of exercise of option was
served
on 2 June 1989.  At the expiration of the term there was a breach of the
covenant in the lease requiring the lessee to keep the premises
clean and in
good and tenantable repair.  No notice had been served under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></u>.  Thus His Honour had to determine if the phrase
"purported exercise of the option" within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E(2)</a> was the giving of the notice
on 2 June 1989 or whether the purported exercise of the option occurred upon
the expiry date of the
original lease.  The case was precisely on the same foot
as the instant case in that it proceeded on the basis there was no occasion
to
give the notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> when the notice of desire to exercise the option
was served, because there was no breach at that time, the breach being on
termination
of the original lease.  Hodgson J said at p58,618 that the clause
he was considering: 
<P>

contemplated that the lack of an existing breach as at the date of termination
of the original lease is a condition precedent to
the exercise of the option
and in my view therefore the purported exercise of the option within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E(2)</a>
does not occur until the end of the term.  In my view <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E(2)</a> then applies to
require the lessor to give a notice under that section within fourteen days
thereafter if he wishes to rely on any
breach as preventing an exercise of the
option.
<P>

It would follow, if that conclusion is right, that in the instant case the
purported exercise of the option was at the end of termination
day, namely 24
June 1999, and that as no notice under the relevant section was given a valid
exercise of the option has taken place.
 I should add that His Honour concluded
that had he been wrong in deciding that the purported exercise of the option
took place at
the termination of the original lease, but rather took place when
the notice was given, then on the reasoning of Young J in
<b><cite>Beca</cite></b> which he seemed to accept, the same result would arise
because there could have been no forfeiture of the equitable right to a new
lease in the absence of a notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s129</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></u>.  As
I have said, I am unable to agree with that and note that no detailed
consideration of this question was necessary for the decision
in
<b><cite>Nessmine</cite></b>.
<P>

23   	The next case for consideration is the decision of Bryson
J in <b><cite>Rethmeier v Pioneer House Pty Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] NSW ConvR.
55-516.</a>  The option clause in the lease under consideration there was in terms
almost precisely the same as those in <b><cite>Nessmine</cite><i>,
</i><cite>McCaul</cite></b> and the instant case.  His Honour's attention does
not seem to have been directed to <b><cite>Nessmine.</cite></b>  At page 58-848
he said in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E(2):</a>
<P>

In my view the subsection was drawn with regard to practices which are long
established and almost invariably followed in New South
Wales with respect to
the manner of exercise of options for renewal of leases in which the delivery
of a written notice is almost
invariably required that the lessee take some
plainly recognisable and active step to show that he wishes to exercise the
option.
 Of course parties could choose some other fact or circumstance as
constituting the exercise of an option and in a completely different
field
relating to option trading in shares parties contract by reference to standard
clauses under which they are deemed to exercise
the option available to them
unless they indicate otherwise.  In my experience such provisions are not known
in respect of leases
and the legislature spoke in relation to well-established
and well-known practices.  This lease conforms with well-established practice
which I take it the legislature had in contemplation, and that practice
requires written notice of an intention to exercise an option.
 That written
notice and its delivery are in my view purported exercise of the option by the
plaintiffs within the meaning of subsec.
(2).
<P>

Even though outstanding matters for perfection of their right of renewal would
be affected by action or inaction of the lessees,
I do not see other action of
the lessees or their omissions to perform covenants as within the range of the
reference by the legislature
to the lessees' purported exercise of the option.
Accordingly, I am of the view that subsec. (2) takes away the effect only of
breaches,
including failures to pay rent in due time, which had occurred up to
the date of the notice, either 12 or 17 May 1989.
<P>

24   	His Honour went on to consider the decision of the Court
of Appeal in England in <b><cite>Bass Holdings Limited v Morton Music
Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20Ch%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] Ch 493</a>, but went on to say that he could see no
difficulty in reconciling the intention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> with the requirement that
after notice was given there should be absolute compliance with the covenants.
It follows that his decision
was contrary to that of Hodgson J in
<b><cite>Nessmine</cite></b>.
<P>

25   	The last case for consideration is <b><cite>Lolly Pops
(Harbourside) Pty Ltd v Werncog Pty Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] NSW ConvR 55-861.</a>
This was another decision of Young J which dealt with many matters not relevant
to the present determination.  Nevertheless His Honour
considered the decisions
in <b><cite>Beca</cite></b>, <b><cite>Nessmine</cite></b> and
<b><cite>Rethmeier</cite></b> and also stated that insofar as an earlier
decision of his in <b><cite>Brennan v Kinjella</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] NSW ConvR
55-677</a> held that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> only applied to breaches up to the date of the tenant's
notice, that should be disregarded.  His Honour decided not to follow the
decision in <b><cite>Rethmeier.</cite></b>  He said that if he did follow it
then the whole purpose of the legislation, which appears from the Minister's
Second Reading Speech
in the Legislative Assembly, would be frustrated.  At
page 56-747 His Honour said:
<P>

Mr Murr submitted that I should follow what Bryson J did in the <b><i>Rethmeier
case.  </i></b>With respect to his Honour, I do not think that I should.  The
whole purpose of the legislature which appears from the extract from
the
Minister's Second Reading Speech set out in the judgment of Kirby, P in the
<i>Snowy River case </i>[Marshall v Council of Shire of Snowy River  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%207%20BPR%2097%2d567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 7
BPR 97-567]</a> at p 14,455 is that the artificial rule in the <i>Gilbert J McCaul
case</i> was to be put to rest and that a more flexible position adopted
whereby in the first instance the parties, and in the second instance
the
court, could do justice in each situation.  It seems to me that the approach
which Bryson, J took virtually means that the remedial
measures taken by the
legislature can be completely thwarted merely by the form of the clause
requiring a notice of exercise to be
given prior to the expiry of the lease.
It seems to me that the constructions taken in <i>Beca</i> and <i>Nessmine</i>
accord far more with what the legislature intended.  Anything contrary to this
in <i>Brennan v Kinjella</i> may be disregarded.
<P>

Thus, in the instant case, even though there were breaches, the landlord did
not give any notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 133E.</a>  The breaches are thus not a complete bar to
the tenant succeeding, they are merely matters which the court takes into
account in
its discretion as to whether to grant specific performance.
<P>

26   	The result of this survey is that there is a disagreement
among members of the court as to the proper construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E.</a>  It is
therefore most unfortunate that it is necessary for me to give another decision
at first instance on this question.  It would
be far better fixed by
legislative amendment setting out an appropriate procedure to be followed if a
lessor wished to rely on breach
of a provision of the lease between the date of
notice of intention to exercise option and the date of expiry of the original
lease,
and requiring the prescribed notice to be given within 14 days of notice
if the lessor wished to rely on breaches up to the time
of the notice from the
lessee.  However, I am required to consider the matter myself giving proper
weight and consideration to the
decisions to which I have referred, comity not
being possible.
<P>

27   	As the second reading speeches in the Legislative Assembly
and Legislative Council on the <u>Conveyancing (Amendment) Bill, 1972</u> have
been referred to and relied upon to some extent by each side in the case before
me and by Young J in <b><cite>Lolly Pops</cite></b>, I set out the relevant
passages from the speech of Mr Maddison, the Minister for Justice in the
Assembly on 23 February 1972 and
the Honourable F.M. Hewitt, Minister for
Labour and Industry in the Council on 8 March 1972:
<P>

28   	Mr Maddison:
<P>

Proposed sections 133c and 133g introduce the principle that a lessee should be
relieved from forfeiture of his option in any case
where the court, after
considering all circumstances, determines that such protection is reasonable.
The amendment attempts to meet
all combinations of contingencies and for that
reason is lengthy and complex.  In essence it provides, in paragraph (b) of
proposed
section 133c, a definition designed to distinguish the undertakings of
a lessee which would normally be found in a lease, whether
or not that lease
contained an option to review or to purchase, and, on the other hand, terms of
a lease which are referable only
to such an option.  The legislative scheme is
that, where a lessee who has committed some breach of his undertakings to the
lessor
attempts to exercise such an option, the lessor, if he wishes to treat
the lessee's conduct as precluding him from exercising his
option, must serve
notice upon the lessee to that effect.  Thereupon, the lessee may approach the
court for relief against forfeiture
on his option and the court, after taking
into consideration various matters specified in subsection (3) of proposed
section 133F
- notably the relative hardship as between lessor and lessee - may
make such orders as it thinks fit for the purpose of granting
the relief
sought, or may refuse to grant that relief.
<P>

Proposed section 133G is basically intended to preserve the lessee's rights
until the court makes its determination and, if the
latter favours the lessee,
for such further time as may prove necessary to enable him to obtain from the
lessor an appropriate instrument
of disposition.  Unfortunately the provision
cannot be drafted as simply as that, because of the numerous permutations of
contingencies,
such as the lease expiring before or after the date of the court
proceedings, the possibility that an option to purchase may be exercisable
outside the term of the lease, and a number of other factors.  Provision for
the various possibilities necessarily makes the amending
legislation appear
quite complex.
<P>

29   	Mr Hewitt:
<P>

The second case is a decision in 1957 of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,
reported as <i>Gilbert J. McCaul (Australia) Proprietary Limited v Pitt Club
Limited</i>, which was concerned with the right of a tenant to exercise an
option for renewal set out in a clause of his lease.  The option was
made
conditional upon the tenant's compliance with the covenants of the lease, one
of which was a covenant to pay rent at specified
intervals.  In fact both
landlord and tenant treated this clause rather casually, with the result that
the rent was paid irregularly
by the tenant without the landlord's raising any
objection.  However, when the tenant purported to exercise his option, the
landlord
treated the breach by the tenant of his undertaking to pay the rent
punctually as ground for refusing to grant a new lease, and the
court upheld
his right to so forfeit the tenant's option.
<P>

The Government feels that in such cases, where considerable hardship would fall
upon the tenant without any corresponding hardship
to the landlord, the court
should be enabled to give relief from forfeiture of an option either to renew
the lease or to purchase
the reversion.  Therefore, new sections 133C to 133G
provide procedure whereby in such cases a court, upon consideration of the
relative
hardship as between landlord and tenant, together with any other
material factors, may relieve the tenant from forfeiture of his
option to
purchase or renew.
<P>

30   	While it is clear that is was sought to cover the various
possibilities and that this intention ought to be given effect to
in case of
doubt, the question is whether s133E bears on the facts in this case.  What is
at issue is "the purported exercise of
the option".  In
<b><cite>McCaul</cite></b> it must be remembered the breaches relied upon by
the lessor were breaches prior to notice of exercise or intention to exercise.
The court in <b><cite>McCaul</cite></b> discussed the position which arose
where an offer is not accepted in accordance with its terms so that the
acceptance amounts to
a counter offer.  At page 124 the following passages
appear:
<P>

If a conditional offer is made and the offeree without performing the condition
purports to accept it, that is to say makes a counter
offer and that counter
offer is accepted, it is a loose although not uncommon use of language to say
that the original offeror has
waived performance of the condition which was
prescribed by his offer as being the manner of accepting it.  In contemplation
of law
the original offeror has done no such thing.  What he has done is to
accept a counter-offer and in the result an agreement is made
but it is not an
agreement consisting of the original offer and an acceptance of that offer.
...
<P>

The <i>American Law Institute's Restatement of the Law of Contract</i> (Vol. 1,
s. 61) states the position clearly and concisely:
<P>

Acceptance of Offer Which States Place, time or Manner of Acceptance.
<P>

If an offer prescribes the place, time or manner of acceptance its terms in
this respect must be complied with in order to create
a contract ...
<P>

The author's note is:
<P>

If the offeror prescribes the only way in which his offer must be accepted, an
acceptance in any other way is a counter-offer.
<P>

In many and perhaps most cases, this may be of little or no practical
importance.  In the present case, however, it may be of considerable
importance.  The plaintiff's purported exercise of the option was not an
acceptance of the offer made in cl. 4, but was a counter-offer
and the question
whether that counter-offer was later accepted was not raised and has not been
litigated, and it must be remembered
that the agreement which would result from
an acceptance of that counter-offer is one of a type which the law requires to
be evidenced
by writing.
<P>

31   	It will be noted that twice in this passage the court
refers to purported exercise of the option by notice.  So did the Minister
in
the Legislative Council.  I do not consider the intention contended for by the
plaintiff is plain from the speeches in the Legislature.
<P>

32   	Judges in this Division are assumed to have a basic
knowledge of  conveyancing practice; <b><cite>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v
Maher</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387</a> at 435.  Thus I can say that I know from
long experience that solicitors generally consider their option problems are
over when a
valid notice of exercise is sent, even if in some instances this is
more properly called "notice of desire for a new lease".  I do
not think that
matters.  I have little doubt that in everyday usage in legal offices the words
"where the lessee purports to exercise
the option" would be seen as referring
to the sending of notice and to have nothing to do with compliance from then on
with the lease.
 I agree with Bryson J on this.  It is a strange view of
language to think that a lessee is purporting to exercise an option by
conforming
to the covenants of the prior lease.  The language of s133G I think,
supports my view.  That section makes provision for an extension
of the term of
a lease, which includes the option, for periods necessary to enable notice to
be given by the lessor after exercise
and a claim for relief to be made by the
lessee.  But on their plain wording, those provisions do not bring about a
renewal of a
term which is already ended before notice.  Yet on the reasoning
in <b><cite>Nessmine</cite></b> the position is that notice can be given up to
fourteen days after the term ends, which situation is not addressed by s133G.
It is
necessary to remember that if the "purported exercise of option" requires
giving notice plus performance of the covenants up to the
end of the term, then
no tenant would know his or her position as to a new term, until after
possession ought to be given up to the
landlord not only because
<b><cite>McCaul</cite></b> requires performance of covenants but also because
there is usually a covenant to deliver up the premises to the landlord in good
repair:  see Short form 5 Schedule IV <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.</u>  And in the same
way no landlord would know whether there was an entitlement to grant a new
lease for the period between termination
and fourteen days thereafter.  It
should not be assumed that such uncertainty was a legislative intention.  I
should add that in
<b><cite>Caltex Properties Pty Ltd v Pittard</cite></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20ANZ%20ConvR%20612" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) ANZ ConvR 612</a> a case in Western Australia dealing with similar
legislation in that State, White AJ quite clearly considered that service of
the
notice was the purported exercise of the option.  There are many cases
where the term "purported exercise of the option" is used,
although obviously
in different factual situations, but they all assume service of notice is
purported exercise:  see for example
 <b><cite>MacDonald v Robins</cite></b>

617</a> at 619
<P>

33   	In the result I conclude that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> does not bear upon
breaches of covenant after notice.  It follows that a condition precedent to
the entitlement to a new lease has
not been fulfilled so that unless there is
some other general relief against forfeiture available the plaintiff's claim
must fail.
 No strong argument was addressed by the plaintiff on this question.
That is not surprising as the law is clear that relief against
forfeiture will
not be granted in respect of loss of a new term, where the loss arises through
non-fulfilment of a condition precedent
to grant.  See <b><cite>Finch v
Underwood</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1876%5d%202%20ChD%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1876] 2 ChD 310</a>; <b><cite>B.S. Stillwell &amp; Co Pty Ltd
v Budget Rent-a-Car System Pty Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20VR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] VR 589</a> at 595.  If relief
had been available, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s133e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s133E</a> would not have been necessary. It follows from this
that the summons should be dismissed and an order for possession made.  The
parties
asked that in the event of this conclusion they have the opportunity to
address or agree upon the time when possession should be
required to be given.

<P>

34   	I conclude by saying I have found it necessary to embark
on such a detailed consideration of the problem in deference to the
competing
views.  It is clear that in this case a substantial amount of money is involved
in this determination.  At least for the
future in the absence of appellate
decision clear legislation should be enacted as quickly as possible.
