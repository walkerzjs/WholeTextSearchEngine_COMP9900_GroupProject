CO</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>&amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In these proceedings, the plaintiff
seeks damages from the defendants, who are partners in a firm of solicitors, G
J Sharah, Henville
&amp; Co.  The issues arise from the circumstance that the
defendants allowed a personal injury claim, which the plaintiff had against
a
Mr Mark Miller, to become statute barred.  In these proceedings, in which Mr P
W Neil SC, with him Mr J Clyne, appeared for the
plaintiff and Mrs L McCallum
appeared for the defendants, the issue which has been debated is the quantum of
the damages to which
the plaintiff is entitled, the principal element of which
is the value of her lost claim against Mr Miller.  
<P>

2   	The plaintiff was born on 20 August 1948.  When she was
fourteen she left school after gaining her intermediate certificate.
 She then
studied at a secretarial college for twelve months to become a shorthand
typist.  She first worked for the Pearl Assurance
Company and, in 1966, she
obtained employment with the firm of solicitors which was then known as G J
Sharah &amp; Co, which later
became G J Sharah, Henville &amp; Co.  Her
progress in the firm was rapid.  From 1969, the plaintiff worked for the
partners until
she left the firm in 1976.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff had married Bernard Crump in June 1974 and,
in 1976, she moved with her husband to live on a six acre property
in Millers
Road, Cattai.  She was employed for six hours a day, four days a week with
Grech &amp; Bannerman, solicitors of Blacktown,
until her first son, Nathan,
was born in 1978.  
<P>

4   	While working for each firm of solicitors, the plaintiff's
typing was extremely fast.  She also did a good deal of conveyancing
work and
would see clients, attend to the execution of documents and organise
settlements.  At G J Sharah, Henville &amp; Co, she
handled much of the
conveyancing work of the firm.  
<P>

5   	The plaintiff gave birth to another son on 1 October 1980
and ultimately planned to return to work shortly after that child
went to
school in early 1986.  
<P>

6   	Throughout this period, the plaintiff had a great interest
in horses.  She learnt to ride in about 1960 or 1961 and, from about
the middle
of 1964, she went to Warriewood each weekend to learn show riding.  In August
1970, the plaintiff leased a thoroughbred
horse and entered the 1971 Royal
Easter Show.  She entered the hacking contest and won third prize.  Thereafter,
she exhibited horses
at a number of local and interstate shows and won prizes
in hacking and riding, including a prize in 1982 when her horse won the
championship hack at the Canberra Royal Show.   In 1984, she won the riding
class at the Sydney Show.  The plaintiff kept four horses
on the property at
Cattai during 1985.  Early in the year she had purchased a thoroughbred horse
named "Marty".  Marty was a quiet,
well behaved horse.  
<P>

7   	The subject accident occurred on 20 June 1985 when the
plaintiff was riding Marty along Millers Road.  The horse was disturbed
by Mr
Miller's two dogs, Sam and Bess, which came out of Mr Miller's property and
disturbed the horse.  The horse bucked.  The plaintiff
was thrown off and fell
to the ground, hitting her head and breaking her left collar-bone.  
<P>

8   	The plaintiff knew that the dogs belonged to Mr Miller.
She said there had been previous occasions when they had barked at
the horse
but they had not previously attacked her.  The plaintiff denied that any
incident such as was described in Mr Miller's
evidence occurred.  
<P>

9   	Mr Miller gave evidence that, on an earlier occasion, he
had seen the two dogs barking at the plaintiff's horse whilst she
was riding
it.  He said that, on that occasion, the plaintiff said to him, "<i>The horse
won't buck, the dogs will get their heads kicked in</i>".  Mr Miller said that,
on that occasion, the pup, Sam, was about three or four feet away from the
horse and both dogs were barking
quite loudly.
<P>

10   	Another witness, Jeffrey Tarrant, said that about a week
before the accident he had been at Mr Miller's home.  He had heard
barking and
had gone out to see what was the problem.  He said that he had seen Bess
barking at the horse.  He said that he saw the
plaintiff pull back on the reins
of the horse, backing the horse up on the dog.  He said that he did not know
whether the plaintiff
was trying to make the horse kick the dog.  She was
telling the dog to go away, to leave her alone.  Mr Tarrant said that he did
not say anything to the plaintiff.  He gave evidence that he was not an
experienced horse rider and that he was not able to say whether
the plaintiff
was intentionally backing the horse or simply trying to keep the horse under
control.
<P>

11   	As the plaintiff cannot remember any incident other than
that dogs had previously come out from the property and barked at
her horse, I
think it is improbable that the plaintiff took any action by way of backing her
horse onto the dogs.  If she said anything
to Mr Miller about the likelihood of
the horse kicking the dogs, I am sure she did that as a warning for their
safety, not as a threat.
 I am satisfied that, before the accident, nothing had
occurred which had caused the plaintiff to be worried.
<P>

12   	However, it is beyond doubt that the dogs had become a
nuisance to passers-by and that Mr Miller was aware of this.  Bess
was a
half-breed Alsatian and Sam, a pup of nine months, was three-quarters Alsatian.
About two weeks before the accident, Mr Miller
had had a visit from an officer
of the local Council and had been told to register the dogs and to keep them
secured.  He had promised
the Council officer that he would keep the dogs
secured.  This meant keeping them on a chain, for there was no front fence to
Mr
Miller's property.
<P>

13   	Mr Miller said, in his evidence, that the pup Sam had
become a nuisance and that he was looking for a means of disposing of
her to a
proper home.  He said that, on the day of the accident, Sam had been chained up
for twenty hours.  As Sam needed a run he
let Sam off the chain with the result
that both dogs went out the front.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff said that she was riding her horse along the
road on the side opposite Mr Miller's home when the two dogs came
out barking.
They started to nip the hocks of the horse Marty.  She said that Marty veered
across the road and then the horse bucked
and she was thrown off.  I accept
that evidence.
<P>

15   	Mr Miller gave the evidence that he went outside when he
heard the dogs barking.  He said that the barking was constant. 
He said that
Bess was near his property but Sam was near the horse.  He said he called the
dogs back and that Sam started to come
back but then turned around again and
was <i>"going for the rear of the horse"</i> when the horse bucked and the
plaintiff was thrown off.
<P>

16   	A few days later, Mr Miller called at the plaintiff's
home, apologised to the plaintiff and expressed a hope that she was
feeling
better.  In the course of conversation, he informed the plaintiff that an
officer of the Council had earlier been to his
house and had instructed him to
have the dogs tied up because there had been a complaint about them.
<P>

17   	In another conversation, Mr Miller said that he could not
make any offer of compensation.  However, Mr Miller at some stage
received a
sum of $10,000 as a result of an industrial accident.  On Mr Miller's evidence,
he instructed his solicitors to offer
$10,000 to the plaintiff.  In August
1987, the solicitors offered the sum of $4,000 inclusive of costs in settlement
of the plaintiff's
claim.  This offer was refused.  Apparently, the plaintiff's
solicitors put a counter offer of $40,000 which was rejected.
<P>

18   	The principles to be applied in this case were laid down
in <b><i>Johnson v Perez</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20166%20CLR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 166 CLR 351</a> and <b><i>Nikolaou v
Papasavas, Phillips &amp; Co</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20166%20CLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 166 CLR 394.</a>  In those cases, it
was held that, where a plaintiff loses the benefit of an action by reason of
the negligence of a solicitor, the
damages recoverable from the solicitor are,
in general, to be assessed by reference to the amount appropriately awarded
when the
action would ordinarily have been determined but for the solicitor's
negligence and not the prevailing award at the time when the
claim against the
solicitor is determined.  In <b><i>Johnson v Perez</i></b>, Wilson, Toohey and
Gaudron JJ said at 366-7:
<P>

"<i>The first component in that assessment [of damages] is the amount of
damages likely to have been awarded by the court before whom
the action against
the employer (as in this case) would have come.  That loss crystallises when
the action is dismissed for want
of prosecution and is then capable of
assessment.</i>"
<P>

Their Honours indicated, however, that evidence of facts after the date of the
hypothetical trial may be relevant.  Their Honours
said, inter alia, at
368-9:
<P>

"<i>Again, the fact that the respondent's damages are to be assessed as at the
time each action was dismissed for want of prosecution
does not mean that
evidence is excluded of events occurring since the dismissal.  Such evidence
may be relevant in a number of ways.
 In the first place, it may assist the
court in placing itself in the position of the trial judge at the notional
trial when a judgment
was to be made of the likely losses that would be
suffered by the respondent in the future and for which the employer was to be
held
responsible.  As Latham CJ pointed out in <b>Willis v The
Commonwealth</b></i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1946/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2073%20CLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 73 CLR 105</a> at 109:</i>
<P>

<i>`...  where actual facts are known, speculation as to the probability of
those facts occurring is surely an unnecessary second-best.
 Damages are
awarded for injury actually suffered and for prospective injury.  Prospective
injury can only be estimated with more
or less probability.  But where the
extent and character of what would at one time be described as prospective
injury depends upon
the happening or non-happening of a particular event and
that event has in fact happened, it is unnecessary to speculate as to whether
or not this event might happen and, if so, when.  In such a case prospective
damage (or diminution of damage) has become actual.'
</i>
<P>

<i>Secondly, in a case where witnesses have died or there is a paucity of
evidence (perhaps because of the negligence of the solicitor)
touching the
condition of a plaintiff at the time of a notional trial, the evidence relating
to subsequent events (including, for
example, later medical reports on a
plaintiff) may assist a court in piecing together the case that could, but for
the negligence
of the solicitor, have been made out in the trial of the earlier
action: see <b>Tutunkoff v Thiele</b>.  In each of these two respects, the
evidence is received for the purpose of assessing the damages that the
plaintiff was likely
to have been awarded had the action gone to trial</i>."
<P>

Dawson J expressed a similar view at 392 where his Honour said:
<P>

"<i>The one qualification which I would make relates to situations where a loss
could have been established as a probable consequence
of the injuries received
at the time the actions were dismissed.  It is appropriate to take such a
consequence into account in assessing
the value of the lost chance and, for
that purpose, there can be no objection to looking at actual events up to the
time of the trial
of the actions against the solicitors as an aid in making
that assessment.  That would involve no departure from the principle that
the
assessment is to be made upon the basis of the loss provable at the time when
the actions against the employers were dismissed;
it would merely give
preference to actuality over conjecture in establishing the precise extent of
the loss.</i>"
<P>

19   	Another element of damages which Wilson, Toohey and
Gaudron JJ indicated could be sought was damages where the plaintiff had
suffered injuries which had been aggravated by delays in the prosecution of the
claim.  Their Honours said at 369:
<P>

"... <i>evidence of subsequent events may be tendered ... in the prosecution of
a claim of aggravation of injury or other loss directly attributable
to the
negligence of the solicitor</i>."
<P>

Brennan J, dissenting on the principal issue, expressed a like view at 373.
Such a claim is not made in the present case except
to the extent that a claim
is made for the shock and distress which the plaintiff suffered when informed
that her action had become
statute barred.
<P>

20   	The general basis upon which the value of the lost cause
of action is to be valued was stated in <b><i>Johnson v Perez</i></b> by
Brennan J in a passage which was later cited with approval by Mason P, with
whom Meagher JA and Dunford AJA agreed, in <b><i>Phillips v Bisley</i></b>
(unreported, Court of Appeal, 18 March 1997).  At 372, Brennan J said:
<P>

	<i>"The value of the lost cause of action is not what a speculator would be
prepared to offer the plaintiff as the price of an assignment
of the cause of
action.  The plaintiff's loss being whatever monetary compensation he would
have received at the time he would have
received it but for his solicitor's
negligence, the court must find whether or not he has lost something of value.
If he would have
failed in the original action, he has lost nothing; if he
would have succeeded, he has lost what he would have received at the time
he
would have received it; if the action would have been compromised, he has lost
what he would have been paid in settlement at the
time when he would have been
paid.  Or, if it is doubtful whether or not he would have succeeded in the
action and it is not probable
that the action would have been compromised, the
court assessing the damages must determine as best it can on the balance of
probabilities
whether the plaintiff would have succeeded (and, if so, to what
extent) or failed.  In making that determination, the court may need
to
estimate the extent to which a successful plaintiff's damages would have been
reduced because of contributory negligence."</i>
<P>

21   	Counsel for the plaintiff alleged that, but for the fact
that the claim became statute barred, Mr Miller would have been liable
both
under the Common Law principles of negligence and under s 20 of the <b><i>Dog
Act 1966</i></b>.  In my opinion, liability for negligence was clear.  The
dogs, and particularly the pup Sam, were a nuisance and troublesome to
passers-by.  Mr Miller was well aware of the problem for he had promised the
Council officer that, to avoid it, he would keep the
dogs secured.  He was
aware that the dogs had troubled the plaintiff's horse by barking.
Accordingly, he knew of the problem.  It
was reasonably foreseeable to him
that, unless he kept the dogs secured, they could cause a horse to behave in
such a way as to dislodge
the rider.  The common response of both humans and
animals to Alsatians and like dogs which approach and bark at them is
sufficient
to found this conclusion.  It matters not that the event may have
been considered unlikely, if the possibility of injury was reasonably
foreseeable: see <b><i>Wyong Shire Council v Shirt</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20146%20CLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 146 CLR 40.</a>
I would not discount this element of the case because of a chance that
negligence may not have been established.  It seems to me
to be a very clear
case.  Nor would I discount the claim because of the submission made by Mrs
McCallum that the plaintiff ought
to have walked and not ridden when passing Mr
Miller's home.  I agree with the view expressed by Clarke JA, with whom Handley
JA
agreed, in <b><i>Zappia v Allsop</i></b> (unreported, Court of Appeal, 17
March 1994) that a member of the public should not be found to be guilty of
contributory negligence
simply by using a public road although knowing that a
particular dog had a propensity to rush out at passers-by.  As Clarke JA
pointed
out, the plaintiff in that case, like the plaintiff in the present
case, had every right to use the road as the plaintiff was doing.
 I should
also mention that this submission was not stated as a particular of negligence
nor put to the plaintiff in cross-examination.
<P>

22   	However, the plaintiff was not wearing a helmet.  In my
opinion, contributory negligence must be taken into account, as the
helmet
would have tended to lessen the blow which the plaintiff's head received and
therefore would have tended to lessen the head
complaints from which she later
suffered.  Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that I should not make that
finding without medical
evidence relating to the effectiveness of head
protection to the precise head injury from which the plaintiff suffered.
However,
by 1985, the effectiveness of head protection to lessen the likelihood
of head injury to motor cycle riders, bicycle riders and horse
riders was well
known.  I think there was sufficient evidence called in the present case
without requiring further explicit evidence
on this point.  In his report,
which was provided to the defendants, Mr J M F Grant stated that it was highly
probable that the degree
of injury that the plaintiff had suffered to the
middle ear would have been very significantly reduced, had she been wearing a
riding
helmet.  Dr J Scoppa, who reported to the plaintiff's solicitors,
observed that he was unaware of any studies that had reported the
effect of
wearing a helmet on the probability of developing inner ear and/or middle ear
trauma and that, in the absence of objective
studies, Mr Grant's statement was
pure conjecture.  I am disposed to accept Mr Grant's view on this point, a view
which was within
the area of his medical expertise.  As the plaintiff's head
complaints were only a minor part of her overall complaints and as they
had
played little, if any, part in her economic loss, I shall not make a specific
allowance in respect of contributory negligence
but will take this matter into
account when assessing general damages.
<P>

23   	Section 20 of the <b><i>Dog Act</i></b> provides:
<P>

<i>(1)	Subject to subsection (2), the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages
in respect of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	bodily injury to a person caused by the dog wounding that person;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	damage to the clothing of a person caused by the dog,</i>
<P>

<i>in the course of attacking that person.</i>
<P>

Contributory negligence may be taken as a defence under this ground of
liability as it may in an action for negligence.
<P>

24   	Notwithstanding that the words "<i>wounding</i>" and
"<i>attacking</i>" could be read as requiring a wound directly inflicted by a
dog, the section has been given a wide meaning so as to include injury
suffered
by a person as a result of an act of aggression by the dog.  Injuries resulting
from pure accidents are not comprehended
by the section.  I accept the view
stated by Sheller JA in <b><i>Eadie v Groombridge</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=16%20MVR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">16 MVR 263</a> at 265
that "<i>`attacking' is an act of hostility or aggression</i>".  In that case,
Meagher JA, with whom Handley JA agreed, found that a dog had attacked the
plaintiff who was riding a motor cycle
at the time when the dog "<i>came
at</i>" him from the footpath, ran parallel with the motor cycle for some short
distance and then turned into the motor cycle, colliding
with it.  The dog was
a German Shepherd.
<P>

25   	The same approach was taken in <b><i>Zappia v
Allsop</i></b> where Kirby P, Clarke and Handley JJA held that an attack had
occurred in the circumstance that a dog charged at a person riding
his bicycle
growling and barking at him.  In that case, it was held by Clarke and Handley
JJA, Kirby P dissenting, that the injuries
suffered by the cyclist, when
ultimately the dog crashed into the rear wheel of the bicycle causing the
cyclist to be thrown to the
ground and knocked unconscious, were a wounding,
although the cyclist and the dog had not come into contact.
<P>

26   	In the present case, I see no relevant distinction between
the riding of a horse and the riding of a motor cycle or bicycle.
 There may be
a distinction of fact in that, in <b><i>Eadie v Groombridge</i></b> and in
<b><i>Zappia v Allsop,</i></b> each dog came into contact with the cycle.
However, in my opinion, an actual contact is not necessary to establish an
attack.  It
is sufficient that the two dogs, Bess and Sam, particularly Sam,
joined in barking at the horse and that Sam at least had nipped
at its hocks.
The plaintiff was thrown off when the dog, who had been called back by Mr
Miller and had commenced to return, changed
its mind and went again for the
horse's rear legs.  
<P>

27   	In my opinion, these facts establish liability under the
<b><i>Dog Act</i></b>.  However, as <b><i>Zappia v Allsop</i></b> was not
decided until after the date upon which the hypothetical trial of the
plaintiff's claim against Mr Miller would have been
heard, I would allow a 15
per cent reduction in the value of the claim for possible uncertainty in
respect of the law at that time.
 
<P>

28   	I have before me an expert opinion by Mr John Coombs QC
who has expressed the view that relevant time cases, arising out of
attacks by
dogs, were almost always commenced in the District Court which, when the action
should have been commenced, had a jurisdictional
limit of $100,000.  This was
increased to $250,000 on 1 July 1993.  Where a defendant consented, the matter
could be heard in the
District Court with unlimited jurisdiction and, if the
jurisdictional limit was a problem, the plaintiff could apply to a Master
of
the Supreme Court for the transfer of the proceedings to that Court.  I think
that I should proceed on the assumption that the
plaintiff's claim would have
proceeded in such a manner that the jurisdictional limit did not apply.
<P>

29   	I would not discount the value of the plaintiff's claim
because of the possibility of settlement.  One reason is that the
plaintiff's
claim against Mr Miller was a strong one and was not one in respect of which it
would be proper to take into account
the value of settlement prospects rather
than the value of the claim itself.  The second is that it is highly unlikely
that Mr Miller
would have been prepared to settle the claim at any figure which
the plaintiff would have accepted.  Mr Miller had no assets other
than his
home.  I cannot see him agreeing to a compromise which would have involved a
loss of that home.
<P>

30   	I turn now to the question of damages.  
<P>

31   	Counsel are agreed that the notional trial date to be
adopted for the purposes of assessment is 1 July 1993.
<P>

32   	Before the accident, the plaintiff had not been in
employment.   However, she did cleaning work for a friend and was paid
$30 a
week for this and also received $50 a week for giving riding lessons to two
children.  She was intending to return to work
in about April or May 1986.
Before the accident, the plaintiff had good health and led an active life.  She
often rode and undertook
the physical work of looking after her horses and
their stables as well as attending to her housework.
<P>

33   	In the accident, the plaintiff suffered a fracture of the
distal tip of the left clavicle.  This was treated first with a
collar and cuff
and then with a sling.  Originally the fracture was treated conservatively
although there was depression and separation
of the fragments of the outer end
of the clavicle.  There was an obvious deformity at the outer end of the
clavicle.  A photograph
shows a disturbing looking bump on top of the shoulder.
An operation was carried out on 15 October 1985 in which tension band wiring
was applied.  At a subsequent operation in April 1986, the pins and wires were
removed.  At the time, her operating surgeon, Dr P
Segelov, thought that the
plaintiff would be happy with the result but that she would be left with some
residual disability amounting
to some 10 per cent loss of function in the
shoulder.  
<P>

34   	The plaintiff had fallen on her left side and, in addition
to hitting her shoulder, she hit her head, with the result that
she suffered
some difficulty with hearing, some loss of balance, ringing or tinnitus in the
left ear and headaches.  She had dizzy
spells from time to time and, at least
for a while, a blurring of her vision.
<P>

35   	On 2 July 1985, the plaintiff saw Dr Mackay who found that
her left ear was full of debris which he removed.  He found that
the eardrum
was injected and there appeared to be fluid behind the drum.  He considered
that the plaintiff's hearing was satisfactory
to whispered voice tests.  After
two weeks, the eardrum was practically normal and the giddiness had settled
down but the plaintiff
still complained that she felt that her hearing was
affected.  An appointment was made for a hearing test in a month's time but the
plaintiff did not keep this appointment.
<P>

36   	The plaintiff also had extensive bruising down the left
side of her body, particularly in the hip area.  She had many aches
and pains
in the early days.
<P>

37   	In addition, the plaintiff suffered a mood change for some
time, becoming very irritable with her husband and children.  The
plaintiff
became nervous with horses.  She sold her horse Marty and, when she did
commence riding again, she often rode in the paddocks
which she and her husband
owned.  Although she rode at shows, she did not achieve her earlier success.
<P>

38   	I have already set out dicta from the reasons in
<b><i>Johnson v Perez</i></b> of Wilson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 368-9 and of
Dawson J at 392, that, for the purpose of establishing the probable
consequences
of injuries received and known at the time of the hypothetical
trial, it is permissible to look at actual events up to the time of
the trial
of the action against the solicitor.  Such an approach gives preference to
actuality over conjecture: see per Dawson J
at 392.  Counsel for the defendant,
Mrs McCallum, submitted that Dawson J expounded the view that the principle
that the law prefers
facts to conjecture has no application where the exercise
is the valuation of a lost opportunity.  However, that is not the point
which
Dawson J made, which is that the actual facts as they have turned out may be
taken into account in assessing the value of the
lost chance.
<P>

39   	This discussion leads to the point that the medical
reports which had been received by the solicitors prior to the proceedings
becoming statute barred were reports dated 1989 or prior thereto.  These
reports were generally favourable in their prognosis.  However,
the relevant
date of the assessment was not 1989 but 1 July 1993.  The plaintiff's current
solicitors obtained other medical reports,
during and after 1994, and these
showed a different picture.
<P>

40   	In my opinion, by July 1993, which was eight years after
the accident, a trial judge would have regarded the plaintiff's injuries
as
having stabilised.  The judge would not, at that stage, have considered that
there was any real prospect of significant improvement
after the conclusion of
the proceedings.  By July 1993, the plaintiff was satisfied that she could not
work again as a legal secretary.
 She in fact took employment with the
Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service as an administrative officer in August
1993.  She has remained
in that employment which, while it involves light
typing work, does not involve the heavy speed typing that previously the
plaintiff
was required to do when working as a legal secretary.  I am satisfied
that employment of the nature which she undertook in August
1993 would have
been regarded by the trial judge as employment of the type which she was fit to
undertake.
<P>

41   	The plaintiff had a great deal of pain after the accident
in June 1985 for she had bruising down her left side, she had broken
her left
clavicle and her head had hit the ground.  The plaintiff recovered gradually
and received a good deal of assistance from
her husband, who fortunately was
available in the afternoons to help with the housework and with looking after
the horses.  Her mother
and her sister also assisted.  It is clear that, in
addition to her physical injuries, the plaintiff was shocked by her accident.
The shock was probably enhanced by the unpleasant looking bump which she had on
her shoulder after the operation and by the fact
that the break did not heal.
The plaintiff lost a good deal of confidence both in her riding and in the use
of her left shoulder
and arm.  She tended thereafter to protect her arm.
<P>

42   	Some of the more recent reports have discussed whether the
plaintiff may have an anxiety state with phobic elements.  I think
that no such
claim would have been made in proceedings heard on 1 July 1993.  However, the
report of Dr E J Alam given on 15 December
1994 also reported, "<i>Marked
nervous shock, characterised by irritability, apprehension, particularly about
riding and driving</i>".  Dr Alam said that, "<i>Without concerted
psychological therapy, she would be unfit for her former riding teaching
activities</i>".  I am satisfied that this element of the plaintiff's condition
was well established by 1 July 1993.  The irritability had been
particularly
noticeable in the twelve months or so after the accident when she felt upset
and depressed.  Her sex life suffered,
particularly in the first two years due
to the pain in the shoulder and her depression.  Dr Alam also reported that the
plaintiff's
left shoulder ached, particularly in winter time when it was cold,
that the scar was tender to touch, that she had had to obtain
a water bed so
that she could sleep on the left side and that, having done so, she was no
longer woken up with soreness and aching
as had been the case in the first few
years.  These are matters to be taken into account.  
<P>

43   	The plaintiff was left with a lengthy scar on the top of
her shoulder as a result of the operation.  It was a prominent disfigurement
which was tender to the touch.  Even in 1989, the plaintiff complained of
tenderness under the scar tissue.  She was unable to lift
heavy weights and did
not again carry buckets of water or the like with her left arm.  The plaintiff
continued to find her left shoulder
painful.  It was thought by Dr J B Lawson
in 1989 that the intermittent pain in her left shoulder which she described
came from the
acromio-clavicular joint.  Dr Lawson then reported that the
plaintiff had regained a full pain free range of movement in the left
shoulder
joint but it was the pain in the left acromio-clavicular joint which continued
to give problems.  The plaintiff found it
painful if she attempted to use a
vacuum cleaner.  She gave up driving except in a car with automatic gears.  She
found typing painful
although she could cope with a light load.  Although she
enjoyed swimming, the plaintiff found it painful to engage in this activity
and
that she could do only limited freestyle.  
<P>

44   	The plaintiff also found that her neck muscles tended to
ache, particularly in cold weather.  Dr Alam noted spasm in the musculature
over both sides of the neck and concluded that she had a neck disturbance with
loss of function.
<P>

45   	I have already mentioned that the plaintiff saw Dr Mackay
shortly after the accident and he found that there was debris in
the eardrum,
that the eardrum was injected and that there was fluid behind the drum.  The
plaintiff suffered for some time with loss
of hearing, loss of balance, ringing
in the ear, headaches, dizziness and blurring of vision.  These complaints
gradually subsided
and, in 1989, Dr Lawson reported that, while the plaintiff
had occasional feelings of slight dizziness in the mornings, her earlier
feeling of persistent dizziness and impaired hearing had resolved.
Notwithstanding the last comment, the plaintiff did in fact continue
to suffer
some problem with her hearing.  Thus, in 1998, Dr G Coffey reported that, in
recent years, the plaintiff's giddy episodes
still occurred to a minor degree
and that, if she became overtired, she at times experienced a brief dizzy
feeling.  Dr Coffey reported
that the giddiness was likely to be due to the
effects of age related degenerative changes on the plaintiff's damaged inner
ear.
 
<P>

46   	Dr J Scoppa examined the plaintiff in 1998 and gave her
hearing tests.  He reported that the plaintiff had a percentage loss
of hearing
calculated at 19.7 per cent for the left ear and 3.4 per cent for the right
ear.  Her binaural hearing loss was calculated
to be 6.7 per cent.  Dr Scoppa
reported that the tinnitus which had been earlier experienced was unlikely to
recur, that her hearing
loss was permanent and that a hearing aid in the left
ear may be of benefit.  He reported that the vertigo which was still present
from time to time may be related to effects of permanent trauma to the organ of
balance in the inner ear and that this may have resulted
from the accident in
1985.  A subsequent test showed that the plaintiff suffered from a directional
preponderance of 19 per cent
to the left which was consistent with a left
peripheral vestibular lesion.  Dr Scoppa concluded that it was probable that
the injuries
which the plaintiff sustained when she fell off her horse had
resulted in damage to the organ of balance in the left inner ear. 
Dr Scoppa
considered that this damage would be permanent and that the plaintiff would
continue to suffer loss of balance and dizziness
when she was overtired.
<P>

47   	Although Dr Scoppa's investigations and reports were made
in 1998, I am satisfied that investigations of a like matter would
have been
undertaken in a trial which came on for hearing on 1 July 1993.  That is
because the plaintiff's complaints of tinnitus,
dizziness and hearing loss had
been made plain to her solicitor.  In a Statement of Claim which was filed by
the defendants on 13
October 1992, after the claim had become statute barred,
the particulars of injuries included <i>"Head injury</i>", <i>"Reduction in
hearing</i>" and <i>"Giddiness and dizziness</i>".
<P>

48   	The plaintiff worked in her husband's office at the
Flemington Meat Markets for twelve months or so during 1987 and 1988.
Thereafter, she did occasional jobs for which she was remunerated.  In about
1991, the plaintiff put her name down with an employment
agency.  Her earnings
from the work she obtained during these years was low.  The plaintiff found
typing work to be difficult and,
in one job in which she was involved with data
processing, she found the work to be painful.  In August 1993, the plaintiff
obtained
full-time work with the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service.  She has
had no problem coping with this work as the typing level is
low.
<P>

49   	Counsel for the defendants has relied upon answers which
the plaintiff gave to a questionnaire required by the employing department,
Human Services and Health.  In her responses, she replied <i>"No"</i> to every
question about an illness or disability, other than that she answered
<i>"Yes"</i> to the need for glasses.  In my opinion, the answers given are of
no significance.  The plaintiff took whatever steps she could to
obtain
employment.
<P>

50   	Relying upon the medical reports of Dr J B Lawson and Dr D
G Seaton, written in 1989, Mrs McCallum submitted that the plaintiff
was fit
for work from twelve months after the accident.  However, I proceed upon the
principles enunciated by Dixon CJ, Kitto and
Taylor JJ in <b><i>Graham v
Baker</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20106%20CLR%20340" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 106 CLR 340</a> at 346-7.  The issue is not what was the
percentage of physical incapacity which resulted from the accident but, in
respect of the
period of time between the accident and the date of the
hypothetical trial, whether the plaintiff lost remuneration as a result of
the
accident and what was the amount of that loss.  I am satisfied that the
plaintiff's recovery was slow and that she undertook
as much remunerative work
as she felt she could undertake and was able to obtain.  She commenced work
with her husband in 1987 but
that provided little remuneration.  Thereafter,
for a few years, she undertook a few short jobs which brought in little
remuneration.
 From about 1991, the plaintiff was actively seeking work.
However, she was unable to find suitable full-time work until August 1993.
 I
am satisfied that, throughout the period, the plaintiff wished to work provided
she could do so.  One problem was that the plaintiff
had been trained as a
secretary but found typing to be painful.  She did some voluntary typing work
for a hacking association but
found that she experienced pain in her shoulder
and into her neck.  She found housework to be difficult and painful.  It was
not
surprising that it took the plaintiff a long time to get back to full
employment.  In my opinion, the plaintiff has established that
she was anxious
and willing to work but she was limited in her capacity to do so.  In these
circumstances, the plaintiff has proved
economic loss up to the date of the
hypothetical trial.  No matter has been put forward as a means by which the
plaintiff could or
should have mitigated her loss.
<P>

51   	As to general damages, taking into account all the matters
I have mentioned, including hearing loss and contributory negligence
in
relation thereto, I consider that a proper award in 1993 would have been
$45,000.
<P>

52   	Of this, 75 per cent should be attributed to the past.
Interest will be calculated at the rate of 2 per cent on that proportion,
in
accordance with the principle established in <b><i>M B P (SA) Pty Ltd v
Gogic</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 657.</a>  The calculation is $33,750 x 2% x 8 giving
the figure of $5,400.  
<P>

53   	I accept that, but for the accident, the plaintiff would
have looked for employment as a legal secretary from about April/May
1986 and I
am content to accept counsel's submission that she would have found such
employment by the end of June 1986.  Exhibit
G sets out the net earnings of a
legal secretary who worked in the Workers Compensation Law Department of an
insurance office.  I
am satisfied to accept those figures reduced by 10 per
cent to reflect lower salaries in the suburbs.  I am therefore content to
accept counsel's figures for the loss from mid-1986 to mid-1993 being $350 x 52
x 7, giving a total of $127,400.  
<P>

54   	The plaintiff gave evidence of a few jobs she had during
this period and, if her evidence was accepted, she would have received
a little
over $9,000 for her work.  Counsel for the plaintiff is content to increase
this to $12,400 in case the plaintiff's memory
is at fault.  I think this
figure should be accepted.  That gives a net loss of $115,000.
<P>

55   	Interest thereon would be $115,000 x 9.5% x 7, a total of
$76,475.
<P>

56   	For the first year after the accident, the plaintiff would
have lost $80 per week from her cleaning and teaching jobs, giving
a loss of
about $4,000 which, with interest, would amount to $5,236.
<P>

57   	By mid-1993, the legal secretary I have mentioned was
earning $512 per week net of tax.  Reduced by 10 per cent, the figure
comes to
$460 per week.  At that time, the plaintiff was earning approximately $400 net
of tax.  The net loss per week was $60. 
On her evidence, the plaintiff would
have worked at least until age sixty.  Therefore, fifteen years are to be taken
into account
using the multiplier 632.3, giving a figure of $37,398.  Reducing
the sum by 15 per cent to discount for the ordinary vicissitudes
of life, one
comes to a figure of $31,788.
<P>

58   	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, as a trial judge
would not have known that the plaintiff would obtain work with
the Commonwealth
Rehabilitation Service, he would have been more likely to have assumed that the
plaintiff had lost a percentage
of her capacity to earn income, which counsel
suggested would have been 40 per cent, and that the judge would have proceeded
on an
assumption of a loss of $200 per week net, which would have given a
future economic loss of over $100,000.  I consider that the judge
would have
thought it probable that the plaintiff could and would return to full-time
employment and would receive remuneration at
about the level which she actually
obtained.  Moreover, as the plaintiff actually did return to full employment in
August 1993 and
has remained in that employment since, it accords with the
principles outlined in <b><i>Johnson v Perez</i></b>, which I have discussed
above, to take account of the actual events.  
<P>

59   	Out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $2,743.
<P>

60   	A claim for domestic assistance is made under the
principle outlined in <b><i>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 139 CLR 161.</a>
I need not discuss the voluntary assistance that has come from the plaintiff's
mother, her sister and her husband.  Counsel for the
plaintiff claimed a sum of
over $12,000.  Counsel for the defendants suggested $10,000.  I adopt that sum.
I think that the claim
in respect of the plaintiff's husband was excessive and
that some of the additional work which he undertook in the domestic field
was
work which husbands can reasonably be expected to do without remuneration.
<P>

61   	There would have been irrecoverable costs in relation to
the legal proceedings.  It is not in dispute that I should assess
these at
$5,000.  
<P>

62   	The summary of damages as at 1 July 1993 is as follows:
<P>

General damages	$45,000
<P>

Interest on past general damages	$5,400
<P>

Loss of income in first year post-accident	$4,000
<P>

Interest on same	$1,236
<P>

Past wage loss	$115,000
<P>

Interest on notional past wage loss	$76,475
<P>

Future economic loss	$31,788
<P>

Out-of-pocket expenses	$2,743
<P>

Claim for voluntary domestic assistance	<u>$10,000</u>
<P>

	$291,642
<P>

Less allowance for irrecoverable costs	$5,000
<P>

63   	The total of these sums is $286,642 which seems to me to
be the fair and reasonable compensation to be awarded had the plaintiff's
claim
been heard and determined on 1 July 1993.
<P>

64   	However, there is another factor to be taken into account
and that is that Mr Miller was uninsured.  He gained employment
in labouring
jobs.  He had few assets except his house and contents.  No value has been put
upon those contents.  I assume from the
photograph of the house that the
furniture and fittings would have had only small value.  Photographs of Mr
Miller's home also show
a car which I assume belongs to Mr Miller.  It would
not have had great value.  Mr Miller subsequently obtained a sum of $10,000
by
way of workers compensation for an injury to his hand.  I assume that this sum
would have been dissipated in legal costs had proceedings
been instituted.
<P>

65   	Evidence has been given by a valuer that Mr Miller's
property would have been worth $205,000 in June 1995 but that prices
rose in
the early part of 1995.  Taking account of the possibility of lower prices if
the property were sold in execution, the cost
of sale and transfer if the
matter were handled privately and the cost of the proceedings necessary to
obtain judgment estimated
at $15,000, I consider that only $175,000 could have
been recovered from Mr Miller.  That was the value of the plaintiff's lost
claim.
<P>

66   	Counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that the plaintiff
would have received an amount of around $190,000 by the end of
1993.  This
figure fails to take into account the cost of the proceedings, which would have
been irrecoverable as Mr Miller had no
funds to pay them.
<P>

67   	Counsel also submitted that the plaintiff would have
received from Mr Miller's trustee in bankruptcy or from the Court by
the
garnishee of his wages an average of at least $100 per week until the balance
of the verdict plus interest had been satisfied.
 However, there is no evidence
that Mr Miller had a wife or dependants to keep him in an occupation where his
wages could be garnisheed.
 In 1992, he was a <i>"casual permanent"</i>.  At
the time of this current trial, he was in permanent employment <i>"labouring on
the turf"</i>.  In these circumstances, it seems to me very unlikely that any
sum would have been recovered from Mr Miller's earnings.  
<P>

68   	Therefore, I take the value of the lost claim to be
$175,000.  I am content to accept the method of calculation of interest
proposed by counsel for the plaintiff.  Over the years 1993 to 1999, the
average rate was 10.75 per cent giving an interest of $5,912.50
for each
$10,000 of the notional recoverable common law verdict.  On $175,000 this
figure is $103,469.
<P>

69   	The plaintiff seeks compensation for the distress which
the plaintiff suffered when told that her claim was statute barred,
distress
which was enhanced by the fact that she regarded the defendants as her friends.
She had worked for them for many years and
she trusted and relied upon them.  I
shall award the sum of $5,000 in accordance with the principles enunciated in
<b><i>Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20344" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 176 CLR 344.</a>  Interest
thereon should be allowed at the rate of 4 per cent for 7 years:  $1,400.
<P>

70   	The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $279,869.
The defendants should pay the costs of the proceedings.
<P>

<b>Further Orders</b>
<P>

71   	I order that pursuant to the `slip rule', paragraph 70 of
this judgment be amended by deleting $279,869 and replacing it with
$284,869.
I order indemnity costs from 7 June 1999.
