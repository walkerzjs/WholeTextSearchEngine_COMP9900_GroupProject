<b><u>L00019/96  -  REGINA    v   HIEP VAN EM LE</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>DETERMINATION</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13A</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> for redetermination of a life sentence imposed by me
after the applicant was convicted by a jury of murder in 1994.  As I have
formed
a firm conclusion as to the outcome of this application, I propose to
deal with it forthwith.  No doubt I could express myself more
fully and
felicitously were I to reserve my judgment but for a number of reasons I have
elected to take the course of dealing with
the matter by giving this ex tempore
judgment.
<P>

2   	The applicant lodged his application some considerable time
ago.  There seems to me to be no reason to add to his anxiety concerning
what
the ultimate outcome should be by reserving my decision when I have, as I have
said, reached a conclusion about the matter.
<P>

3   	The second reason why I think it is appropriate to deal
with the matter now is I have been informed that there are relatives
of the
deceased victim present in Court and I think it is appropriate that they should
hear the reasons I express for the course
I am going to take.
<P>

4   	It scarcely needs any comment from me to observe that an
innocent life was taken by this crime.  In my remarks on sentence
in 1994 I
made some observations about what I then called the forensic history of both
the applicant and some former co-accused.
 Those remarks may be taken as
incorporated in what I say today.
<P>

5   	In broad terms five young men including the applicant
invaded, to use a currently popular term, a house across the road from
the
residence of an acquaintance of theirs which had been the subject of a robbery.
Apparently amongst other things items such as
a video recorder and television
were alleged to have been taken.  The residents of the house were a family.  In
addition, the victim
and his partner resided in a caravan at the rear of the
house.  When the invading group came to the house, the young man who resided
in
the caravan simply came forward in order to see what the commotion was about.
In the course of this, the applicant stabbed him.
 This fatality was of course
totally unnecessary.
<P>

6   	In the course of legal proceedings, one of the five
invaders was given immunity in order to provide evidence against the others.
Without again detailing all the various trials and appeals, the ultimate
outcome was that apart from the applicant no person was
punished for this
crime.  In a sense of course the applicant merited punishment because he was
the one who produced the knife and
caused the fatality.
<P>

7   	At the time of sentence I declined to find that there were
mitigating circumstances such as would have reduced the culpability
of the
applicant so as to justify my then imposing upon him a sentence less than the
mandatory life term.  The mandatory life term
however must be viewed in the
context of its application up until the passage of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>
1989.  Prisoners sentenced to life penal servitude were routinely released on
ticket of leave in a continuing practice dating virtually
from the European
settlement of this State in 1788.  The nature of the tickets of leave was that
such persons were on parole unless
a special order was made by the governor
terminating the conditional nature of liberty.  
<P>

8   	The relevance of that history at the moment is that but for
the passage of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> the applicant would have reasonably
expected to have been considered for release upon ticket of leave at some time
after serving
a significant portion of his sentence.  The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>
itself reflects this in the sense that it makes available an application such
as this after at least eight years' imprisonment has
been served.
<P>

9   	In the present case, the applicant has been in custody
since late in the evening of 28 September 1988.  He was first before
a court on
the following day and pursuant to the order I made in 1994 his sentence dates
from then.
<P>

10   	The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> and the general law require me
to take into account a number of matters, particularly subjective matters
concerning the applicant.
 It should be emphasised at the outset that my
setting of a minimum term as I have indicated I intend to do does not of itself
operate
as an order for release of the applicant on the expiry of that period.
It will remain ultimately a decision for the parole authorities
to determine
when within the ambit of the total sentence the applicant can appropriately be
released into the community.  
<P>

11   	Thus I turn to some subjective matters concerning the
applicant.  His background shares the tragedy of many migrants to this
country
who came here looking for a new life after the ravages of the Vietnam conflict.
Apart from his wife, to whom I will make
later reference, he has no really
close family ties in this country.  His background was that his family were
fisherfolk.  At the
time of the sentencing proceedings in 1994 I was provided
with information as to how the applicant first at about the age of fourteen
came into contact with intoxicating liquor.  It appears that it was the
practice of the fishermen when the weather was too rough
to put out to sea to
tend to their nets and spend their time, perhaps for days on end, drinking
fortified liquor such as rice wine.
 Later when he came to Australia the
applicant began to partake of other forms of intoxicating liquor and Dr
Barclay, whose assessment
I found then and I find now to have been most
helpful, said that in general terms the applicant could have been described in
1988
as an alcoholic.  No doubt he was considerably affected at the time of
committing this crime.
<P>

12   	It appears that during his incarceration he has recovered
from alcoholism although this has been replaced to an extent by
participation
in drug ingestion.  I infer that he was able to obtain drugs whilst a prisoner.
It is notorious that in the prison
system in this State drugs are obtained by
prisoners.  Indeed, frustrated at the apparent lack of listing of his
application for
redetermination, in February this year the applicant mixed a
cocktail of drugs and undertook what I assess to be a suicide attempt.
Self-evidently this was unsuccessful but it gives an indication of the feelings
of the applicant as at the time.
<P>

13   	His prior record, that is to say prior to his arrest on
this matter, is by no means admirable.  As Mr Thompson for the Crown
has
reminded me, he had been released on parole but a few days before he committed
this terrible crime.
<P>

14   	After his arrest he was interviewed by police.  His
responses were unusual, indeed unique to my experience, in that from time
to
time one finds persons who are the focus of allegation who deny the matters put
to them; one finds people who admit them.  In
this case, the applicant said he
had no memory of the event but in effect if his friends said he had done it,
then he accepted he
had.  He has maintained that posture to the present time.
He has said that he has no recollection of this event but he accepts from
the
evidence of others that he must have done so.  Given his consistent and steady
adherence to that posture and given the expressions
of remorse that he has
made, I accept that that is the true situation.
<P>

15   	I said that I would turn to the situation concerning the
applicant's wife.  A young woman, now Olian Le, had been at school
with the
applicant.  She is a native of Cambodia but now an Australian citizen.  She
came to know of the plight of the applicant
serving his sentence through a
family contact.  There is evidence from her on affidavit.  I find that evidence
quite impressive.
 The material set out therein demonstrates a balanced young
woman, anxious to set up a regular and lasting relationship with her
husband.
She did not rush into marriage with the applicant and indeed it was something
over three years before she accepted his proposal.
 She has stated that she
only agreed to marriage when she had satisfied herself that he had changed from
his past and would be a
good husband and had an understanding of the bad things
that he had done in the past.  This young woman has set up a home just over
the
Queensland border.  She has employment.  She supplements her income by some
sewing and dressmaking work.
<P>

16   	The applicant himself has commendable reports concerning
his work history whilst in prison.  There are a number of prison
offences but I
do not regard them as critical in the current circumstances.  His work history
shows that he has diligently applied
himself to work in the textile industry
conducted in the gaol and has become an efficient and effective self-taught
sewing machine
mechanic.  That skill will undoubtedly complement his wife's
industry and intentions as to occupation.
<P>

17   	The applicant was twenty two years of age at the time of
the offence.  He has now been in custody nearly eleven years.  As
I am required
to do by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>, I take into account the previous practice
concerning release on licence and I also take into account my own knowledge of
the range
of sentence which is generally imposed for offences of murder.  No
two offences are identical and I do not suggest that there is
anything
approaching a tariff for offences such as this.  It would appear however that
the applicant has, after a stormy period whilst
in gaol initially and
particularly in the period prior to the second trial over which I presided in
1994, set upon a path of genuine
attempt at rehabilitation.  He should
therefore have the opportunity to demonstrate that he can contribute to society
as a useful
and law abiding citizen.
<P>

18   	I am not bound to divide sentence into minimum and
additional terms in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> </b> when
dealing with a matter pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13A.</a>  I indicated to counsel during
exchange that I had in mind setting a longer total term of imprisonment but
setting a minimum term
which will expire within a foreseeable time, emphasising
of course as I have said earlier that it will be for the parole authorities
to
decide whether or not the applicant is actually ready for release.  He is
presently still at B classification although he has
apparently remained frozen,
as it were, in that classification because the current matter has been pending
now for over two years.
It will be necessary for him to pass through the C
classifications and to see whether or not he can be trusted for example upon
work
release and other leave.
<P>

19   	In setting a long additional term, it is not my
expectation that the applicant will necessarily require supervision during
the
whole of the term.  Nevertheless, I think it appropriate that such term should
be of remaining potential so that in the event
that he does not fulfil the
promise that he currently gives, he will understand that he may be returned to
serve the balance of the
total sentence.  
<P>

20   	Hiep Van Em Le, for the murder of Alan Stanley Ball, in
lieu of the sentence of penal servitude for life which I imposed upon
you on 14
October 1994, I sentence you to a total term of twenty years' penal servitude,
to commence on 29 September 1988.  That
sentence is to comprise a minimum term
of twelve years commencing on 29 September 1988 and to expire on 28 September
2000 AD, together
with an additional term of eight years commencing on 29
September 2000.  You will first become eligible for parole on 28 September
2000.
