<b>JUDGMENT (Justification - adequacy of particulars - contextual truth (<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
16</a></i>) non-availability of plaintiff's imputations "<i>complained of</i>"
therefor - comment - sufficiency of particulars)</b>
<P>

1   	A question has arisen as to the adequacy of particulars of
justification.
<P>

2   	The first imputation justified is 2(a):
<P>

<i>"(a)	The plaintiff refused to co-operate with his employers (as he was
obliged to do so) because be would not supply particulars of
his complaints
concerning the Victims Compensation Tribunal".</i>
<P>

3   	The particulars hitherto provided are as follows:
<P>

<i>"(a)	Every employee, including, in particular, state public servants, has a
legal and moral obligation to supply information relating
to his employment
when lawfully requested by his employer.</i>
<P>

<i>(aa)	Insofar as it is a legal obligation the obligation referred to in the
preceding paragraph is implied by law as part of an employee's
contract of
employment and is a necessary incident of an employee's fiduciary relationship
with his employer.</i>
<P>

<i>(ab)	The defendant relies on the Attorney-General's Code of Conduct which
has been discovered.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Every employee, including, in particular, state public servants, has a
legal and moral obligation to substantiate serious allegations
made by him
relating to his employment if requested by his employer.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The plaintiff was employed from May 1993 as a casual clerk in the office
of the New South Wales Crown Solicitor.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	The plaintiff in a written report which he prepared in September 1993
and circulated, amongst others, to the New South Wales Opposition
made a number
of serious allegations concerning the Victims Compensation Tribunal, the manner
in which it operated, and the decisions
which it had made.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	On 22 November 1993 John Withington, the Acting Crown Solicitor,
requested the plaintiff to supply further details of his allegations.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	By letter dated 22 November 1993 the plaintiff refused to supply the
information requested by Mr Withington".</i>
<P>

4   	<i>Additional Particulars</i>:  "<i>The request was made
orally by Mr Withington in a conversation with the plaintiff and is referred to
by the plaintiff in his letter
of 23 November 1993".</i>
<P>

5   	<i>Further Particular</i>:   <i>"The request was made
orally and is set out in Mr Withington's note of 20 June 1994 (which has been
discovered and which the plaintiff
countersigned to indicate it was
accurate)"</i>.
<P>

<i>"(g)	On 20 June 1994 the plaintiff was again requested to provide the
information in his possession in relation to the Victims Compensation
Tribunal
so that it could be investigated.</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	The plaintiff refused to comply with the request set forth in the next
preceding sub-paragraph.</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	The refusal set forth in (f) and (h) were breaches of the plaintiff's
obligation as an employee.</i>
<P>

6   	It is submitted for the plaintiff that these particulars
generally amount to "<i>tendentious rhetoric"</i> (see <b><i>Assaf v
Skalkos</i></b> (Levine J, 15 December 1997, unreported at 5) and are
argumentative (<b><i>Assaf v SKalkos</i></b> (Levine J, 28 January 1998,
unreported at 6).
<P>

7   	There ever seems to be the need to remind parties to
litigation in the Defamation List that particulars of justification should
be
proper responses to a request for the "<i>facts, matter and circumstances upon
which the defendant relies in support of the truth of the imputation,</i>" that
is, its sting or substance.  A defendant must specify those facts, matters and
circumstances and is perfectly free to specify
any conclusions or assertions to
be drawn from or which will be made upon the proof of those facts, matters and
circumstances.  Without
the underlying facts, matters and circumstances having
been particularised a complaint as to tendentious rhetoric (or bland banality)
may legitimately be made.
<P>

8   	Further it is no answer for a defendant to assert that a
plaintiff "<i>knows</i>" by reason of information in the plaintiff's possession
or by reason of documents the plaintiff might have and of which discovery
has
been given.  It is not what the plaintiff knows but the case that the defendant
proposes to present that is the essence of particulars.
<P>

9   	What the plaintiff might know might be relevant to any
question of prejudice that may arise in circumstances of late amendment
or
insufficient particularisation of the case the defendant is otherwise going to
make.  The defendant is not relieved of the obligation
properly to
particularise a defence of justification merely because it is asserts that most
of the information, if not all, of it
happens to be in any event in the
knowledge of the plaintiff.
<P>

10   	In respect of the particulars originally supplied and
supplemented obviously reference has been made to various documents.
 These
should be the subject, at least, of informal discovery if not of the filing of
a proper affidavit.  Legitimate complaint can
be made on the part of the
plaintiff in relation to the apparent inconsistencies of dates as to the
request namely 22 November 1993
and 20 June 1994.  If requests were made on two
occasions particulars should be provided of the date and the manner of making
the
request.  If the latter is a document it should be identified clearly and
reference made to any particular part of it said to constitute
the request.
Similar particulars should be given in relation to any alleged refusal of the
request and clearly discovery of those
documents should be given.
<P>

11   	It is clear that what the plaintiff is seeking to have
exposed by the defendant as his case, is the foundation for the existence
of
the obligations relating to non-disclosure and compliance with the requests by
superiors.  These may presumably arise at common
law or by reason of there
being in place a particular contract of employment, statutory provisions
relating to the employment of
the plaintiff and the like.  The plaintiff is
entitled to have identified the statutory or similar material especially and
any parts
thereof upon which particular reliance will be made as either
establishing as a matter of fact the existence of the obligations or
from which
it can be argued that the existence of the obligations can rationally be
inferred.  The same applies to the obligation
to comply with any request from
superiors.  The particulars hitherto supplied are fairly general in their
nature:  if that is the
best the defendant can do, the plaintiff is no doubt
advantaged.  However where there are facts, matters and circumstances
constituted
by material establishing the specific obligations or specific
duties, the defendant should not only particularise them but give discovery
of
relevant documents.
<P>

12   	In relation to additional particular concerning the
"<i>oral" </i>request, the plaintiff is entitled to have particularised what
the defendant asserts to be the terms of that oral request; that is
particulars
of that part of the conversation which the defendant will no doubt prove by
calling the relevant party to the conversation.
 It may well be, but I don't
know, but what was said was "<i>Would you please provide further details of
your allegations?"</i>  The defendant, if he can, should further particularise
this aspect.
<P>

13   	As to the plaintiff's submission that a particular cannot
be constituted by a construction put on a document, that is not
without
substance.  If the document is said to constitute a refusal then the document
must be identified, the passage relied upon
must also be identified.  The
defendant is still free to argue that the particular document and relevant
passages constitute a refusal.
 That is a matter for the trial.
<P>

14   	On reviewing the particulars supplied hitherto in relation
to imputation 2(a) it seems to me that the conduct of the litigation
has been
disadvantaged by there not having been formal discovery and the situation has
arisen, in view of the desirability of the
early fixing of the hearing date,
that such an order should be made.
<P>

15   	Imputation 2(b):  "<i>the plaintiff knowingly breached
public sector standards of behaviour by disclosing information concerning the
administration of the
Victims Compensation Tribunal"</i>.
<P>

16   	The particulars supplied hitherto are: "<i>(a)  All
employees have an obligation not to disclose confidential information of their
employer".</i>
<P>

17   	Pausing here, as I understand it, the defendant's case
rests upon the plaintiff working as a solicitor's clerk, that is, in
the employ
of the State Crown Solicitor and was dealing with information concerning a
client of the State Crown Solicitor namely,
the Victims Compensation Tribunal.
The observations I have made as to the requirements in the defendant properly
to particularise
an allegation of this kind apply with equal force here.
<P>

<i>"(b)	The information referred to above was confidential and in disclosing it
the plaintiff breached public sector standards of behaviour".</i>
<P>

18   	The defendant relies, as I understand it, on the
particulars purported to have been provided in (aa) and (ab).  The requirement
for elaboration is clear;  I have already remarked upon it.
<P>

19   	The particulars hitherto provided are very general in
their nature and can be regarded as unhelpful in informing the plaintiff
as to
what precisely the defendant's case is in relation to this imputation.
<P>

20   	Imputation 2(c):  <i>"the plaintiff is irresponsible".
</i>(See my judgment delivered in this matter on 30 October 1996 at 7:  this
imputation is also to be found in the same form as imputations
4(b), 4A(c)).
<P>

21   	If the defendant is relying upon all the matters properly
particularised in support of the preceding imputations to argue
that the sting
of this imputation is available as a rational inference and conclusion then it
should simply state that to be the
fact.  
<P>

22   	Imputation 4(a):  "<i>the plaintiff deliberately adopted a
pseudonym, "Mr James" to cause some embarrassment to the real Mr James"</i>.
This imputation has not been justified.
<P>

23   	Imputation 4A(a):  <i>"the plaintiff refused to cooperate
with his employers (as he was obliged so to do) because he would not supply
particulars of his
complaints concerning the Victims Compensation
Tribunal"</i>.
<P>

24   	As I understand it, the defendant relies again on the
matters otherwise hitherto particularised and which should be amplified
in
accordance with these reasons.  The defendant has said "<i>see above</i>";  it
is desirable however that the defendant says "<i>the defendant repeats the
following particulars"</i> and identifies them.
<P>

25   	Imputation 6(a):  "<i>the plaintiff held himself out as a
`whistleblower' when he was a person without any credibility</i>".
<P>

26   	The particulars provided are as follows:
<P>

<i>"(a)	the plaintiff referred to himself as a whistleblower.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the allegations made by the plaintiff were baseless.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	people who make baseless allegations lack credibility.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the reason set forth in the plaintiff's letter of 22 November 1993 for
his refusal to supply the information lacks credibility".</i>
<P>

27   	There is a further particular to this effect.  The
defendant apparently has identified a document (dated 28 September 1993)
in
which the plaintiff is "<i>alleged</i>" to have referred to a quote from Pastor
Niemoller which, the defendant says, indicates the plaintiff regarded himself
as a whistleblower.
 In relation to this purported additional particular
(whatever it means), the plaintiff says this is "<i>unhelpful and
insulting</i>".
<P>

28   	Obviously the plaintiff can complain about the inadequacy
of particular (a).  The plaintiff is entitled to particulars of
the facts,
matters and circumstances identifying when, where, how and to whom the
plaintiff identified himself as a "<i>whistleblower</i>".  If the
identification of the plaintiff as a whistleblower is asserted as a matter of
inference then all the foundations for that
inference should be
particularised.
<P>

29   	As to particular (b);  the allegations there referred to
should be particularised as should the basis in the usual way upon
which it is
asserted that those allegations were "<i>baseless".</i>
<P>

30   	Particular (c) is probably the closest there is to
tendentious rhetoric;  it might also be a legitimate submission to be made
founded upon properly particularised facts, matters and circumstances.  I
should leave it as a particular but it is there at the
defendant's peril.
<P>

31   	Presumably particular (d) refers to matters otherwise
hitherto particularised.
<P>

32   	Insofar as it asserted that the reason set forth in the
plaintiff's letter (particulars whereof no doubt will have been or
should
properly be given and the letter discovered), lacks credibility, is a matter of
submission.
<P>

33   	As to the reference to Pastor Niemoller it was, not only
during submissions, I must confess, but even upon consideration of
the issue
generally, meaningless to me.  What Pastor Niemoller said is well known in
relation to the self-imposed silence by reason
of his not speaking out
beforehand during the rise of the Nazi regime.  Where in the scheme of things
Pastor Niemoller's statement
falls, I simply do not know.  It does not however
seem to me to be a matter that should thwart the conduct of the trial or
constitute
a matter of prejudice to the plaintiff.  I will leave it to the
defendant to "<i>sort this out"</i>.
<P>

34   	Imputation 6(b):  <i>"the plaintiff refused to cooperate
with his employers as he was obliged to so do because he would not supply
particulars of his complaints
concerning the Victims Compensation
Tribunal"</i>.
<P>

35   	It is contended that no particulars at all have been
supplied in relation to the justification of this imputation.
<P>

36   	If that be the case, then the defendant is simply to
provide particulars in proper form in accordance with these reasons in
answer
to a request as usually framed:  specify the facts, matters and circumstances
upon which the defendant relies in support of
its assertion of the truth of
this imputation.
<P>

37   	In relation to the plea of justification under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> it would seem to me that the appropriate orders to
be made are:
<P>

1.	Within 14 days the defendant is to deliver a Verified List of Documents.
<P>

2.	The defendant is to provide further and better particulars of its case in
justification in accordance with these reasons.
<P>

38   	The next matter that I understand to be the subject of
complaint is what is said to be the inadequate <b>particularisation of the
defence of comment</b>.  I assume that there has been no provision of further
particulars of this defence.
<P>

39   	In <b><i>Konstantinidis v Foreign Language Publications
Pty Limited </i></b>(Levine J, 8 August 1997, unreported) I referred to the
requirements of the particulars of the defence of comment at 7-14.
<P>

40   	It is clear that a plaintiff in this case is entitled to
have identified the "<i>facts stated in the matter complained of</i>" upon
which it is said the comment was based.  
<P>

41   	The quality of those "<i>facts</i>" stated in the matter
complained of (being the material for comment) which makes that material
"<i>proper</i>", is that they are "<i>truly stated"</i>.
<P>

42   	In <b><i>Konstantinidis</i></b> I referred to the judgment
of Hunt J in <b><i>Sims v Wran</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%201%20NSWLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 1 NSWLR 317</a> and his Honour's
statement at 325F that particulars of the facts and matters upon which the
defendant relies to establish the truth
of the factual basis for the comment
can be ordered if not voluntarily supplied.  This seems to be an appropriate
case to make such
an order.
<P>

43   	The remaining matter that appears to be in dispute is the
<b>defence</b> <b>of contextual truth </b>set out in paragraph 8 of the Defence
to the Amended Statement of Claim which was filed in Court on 4 April 1997.
That defence is
in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"8(a)	each of the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff which is not found to
be a matter of substantial truth was published contextually
to each other of
the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	each imputation pleaded by the plaintiff related to matters of public
interest or, in the alternative, was published under qualified
privilege;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	by reason of the substantial truth of the plaintiff's imputations as are
found to be matters of substantial truth, publication
of such of the
plaintiff's imputations as are found to be matter f substantial truth do not
further injure the reputation of the
plaintiff".</i>
<P>

44   	It is contended by the plaintiff that this does not plead
an available defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> (contextual
imputations) because it "<i>pleads back</i>" the plaintiff's imputations.
<P>

45   	It seems to me that this submission is well founded.  The
structure of the defence provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> has been considered by the Court
of Appeal in <b><i>Perkins v Harris</i></b> (26 May 1995);  <b><i>Waterhouse
&amp; Anor v Hickie</i></b> (26 May  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%29%201995%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995) (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-347</a>;
and, <b><i>TCN Channel Pty Limited v Antoniadis</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 682.</a>  I
considered the matter in <b><i>Hall &amp; Anor v Nationwide News Pty Limited
</i></b>(5 November 1998, unreported (DLJ: 2)).  
<P>

46   	Contextual imputations are imputations not pleaded by the
plaintiff.  They are imputations that are not "<i>imputation(s) complained
of</i>" by the plaintiff.  They are "<i>other</i>" imputations.
<P>

47   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 15</a> provides the defence of truth in relation to
imputations "<i>complained of"</i> by the plaintiff.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 16</a> provides a
defence whereby a defendant can plead <i>"other</i>" imputations than those
"<i>complained of"</i> by the plaintiff which arise at the same time and in
addition to those "<i>complained of"</i> by the plaintiff and provided they
differ in substance from those pleaded by the plaintiff. 
<P>

48   	Where a defendant justifies some but not all of the
imputations "<i>complained of"</i> by the plaintiff (that is, justifies
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15)</a> I do not see any statutory basis for the use by the defendant
of "<i>unjustified</i>" imputations "<i>complained of"</i> by the plaintiff as
"<i>contextual imputations</i>".  It might be considered that this position is
heretical and contrary to the observations of Hunt J in <b><i>Allen v John
Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited </i></b>(2 December 1988, unreported) expressly
said to be correct by Priestley JA in <b><i>Perkins v Harris</i></b> at
9-10.
<P>

49   	In the absence of any "<i>other</i>" imputations being
relied by the defendant strictly in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> as contextual
imputations, the defendant can still plead truth to the plaintiff's
"<i>complained of"</i> imputations or some of them and as to the balance in
respect of which there is no plea of justification pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a>, rely upon
the truth of the "<i>complained of"</i> imputations in mitigation of damages.
In other words, the ultimate objective sought to be attained by the use of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a>
can be attained in mitigation of damages when the only defence is in fact a
defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15.</a>  It is open to the defendant to argue that by reason of the
truth being established of imputations 1, 2 and 3 the damages to the
plaintiff's reputation in respect of the unproved imputation 4 and 5 is zero.
No damage to the plaintiff's reputation has in fact
been proved by reason of
the truth of imputations 1, 2 and 3 and indeed the case is such that any
presumption of damage arising from
unproved imputations 3 and 4 has been
rebutted.
<P>

50   	I strike out paragraph 8 of the Defence to the Amended
Statement of Claim.
<P>

51   	It seems to me that the plaintiff has succeeded
substantially in this application and is entitled to an order for costs.
<P>

52   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Within 14 days of today the defendant is to deliver a Verified List of
Documents.
