<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY 22 JULY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>3287/99 - BRADLEY V ASHTON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>This is the final hearing of a suit
that was commenced earlier this afternoon whereby mortgagors seek declarations
that their mortgagee
is intending to take enforcement action to auction their
properties tomorrow, contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> of  the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act 1994</a>.
<P>

2   	The properties involved are in the Braidwood area upon
which the plaintiffs run cattle.  They have been doing so for some time.
 They
borrowed money from the defendant, the amount of the debt is not clear, but it
would seem to be over one million dollars.
<P>

3   	The plaintiffs previously made an application in
proceedings 2276/99 for much the same relief as is presently sought in respect
of previous enforcement action involving an earlier auction.  Those proceedings
came on before Austin J on 12 May 1999.  The proceedings
were settled.  His
Honour ordered in accordance with the short minutes that the summons be
dismissed and that the plaintiffs pay
the defendant's costs agreed at $6,000.
The court then noted an agreement between the parties, essentially being that
the plaintiffs
would pay, and the defendant would accept, one million dollars
on or before 4pm, 9 July 1999 in full satisfaction of all that was
owing to
him.  If that money was not paid then the plaintiffs would give the defendant
vacant possession of the properties before
9am on the next day and they
undertook to the court that they would do so.  They also undertook to the court
that they would not
make any further application in a court for a stay or
injunction preventing the defendant exercising any enforcement action.
<P>

4   	The orders that were sought in the previous proceedings
were in accordance with paras 1 and 2 of the summons that the relevant
debt was
a farm debt within the meaning of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act 1994</a> and that the
defendant had failed to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8(1)</a> of that Act.  The rest of the orders
were consequential injunctions.
<P>

5   	Today the plaintiffs ask for the same orders, plus an order
that they be released from their former undertaking, together with
a
declaration that the agreement in the short minutes of order of 12 May
constitutes an agreement which contracts out of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act</a>
contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20</a> of that Act.
<P>

6   	The plaintiffs seek injunctions preventing the auction
tomorrow, plus declarations that the debt is a farm debt and the defendant
has
failed to comply with the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8.</a>
<P>

7   	Mr Harrison SC who appears for the plaintiffs candidly put
that there is no argument that if the Act and in  particular <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">20</a> did
not apply that there would be an estoppel.  However, he said that there could
be no estoppel in the face of the statute, particularly
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 6</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">20</a>, which
evinced a firm intention by the legislature that the mediation provisions of
the Act could not be outflanked.
<P>

8   	This submission is certainly correct.  There are judgments
of high authority in cases where people sought to use estoppels
to make life
easier for landlords under the local and overseas equivalent of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lata1948257/" class="autolink_findacts">Landlord
and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1948</a>, which were completely unsuccessful.  In <b>J
&amp; F Stone Lighting and Radio Ltd v Levitt</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1947%5d%20AC%20209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1947] AC 209</a>, 216 Lord
Thankerton said that:
<P>

"It is idle to suggest that either estoppel or res judicata can give the court
a jurisdiction under the Rent Restriction Acts, which
the statute says it is
not to have."
<P>

9   	That thought and similar thoughts were applied in this
State in the Full Court decision in<b> Barilla v James</b> (1964) 81 WN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lata1948257/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Pt 1)</a>
(NSW) 457, particularly at 462-3.  Walsh J quoted a further passage from Lord
Thankerton's judgment that in this sort of matter the
court cannot be prevented
from looking at the true facts, and no legal technicality can prevent the
tenant from calling the attention
of the court to those facts so that the
policy of the Act will be complied with.
<P>

10   	It is to be noted that Lord Thankerton speaks not only of
estoppel but also res judicata.  As to res judicata, it would seem
to me that
bearing in mind the principles referred to in Spencer Bower Turner and Handley
on<b> Res Judicata</b> 3rd ed  (Butterworths, London, 1996) particularly paras
38, 39 and 56, one must look at the summons and the evidence in the former
proceedings to see what the dismissal determined.
<P>

11   	The dismissal must have determined the issues that the
debt was not a farm debt within the meaning of the Act and/or that
the
defendant had failed to comply with the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lata1948257/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8.</a>  Query whether both.
It seems to me that really one cannot conclusively say it must have been
both.
<P>

12   	Accordingly, even if there had been a res judicata it
would not have conclusively dealt with the matter in the defendant's
favour.
<P>

13   	However, as on high authority neither estoppel nor res
judicata can prevent the court from looking at the true facts, the
matter is
not an answer to the plaintiffs' claim in any event.
<P>

14   	Accordingly, I have to look at the true facts.  I have
looked at the material in suit 2276/99 only for background and to work
out what
was the issue before the court.  The only evidence in the actual suit is the
evidence of Mr Bradley, who says that he is
engaged in a farming operation with
cattle and that there has been no mediation. I appreciate that the suit was
only commenced earlier
this afternoon and there has been little opportunity to
put on evidence, but that is the only evidence before the court at the
moment.
<P>

15   	Should the court then grant an injunction?  I think the
answer to this question is "No".   This is a Court of Equity and a
person who
comes before the Court of Equity must come with clean hands.
<P>

16   	Even putting out of consideration entirely that the
plaintiffs may be in contempt of court because of their  undertaking to
give
vacant possession on 10 July, which they just have not done, the quite clear
promise on 12 May was that they would not make
any further application to the
court.
<P>

17   	Normally people who are in breach of an undertaking to the
court and also breach a promise get no relief in this Court at
all.  That is
so, even if what they are seeking to do is to rely on statutory rights that a
transaction in breach of public policy
ought to be restrained; see<b> Lodge v
National Union Investment Co Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%201%20Ch%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] 1 Ch 300.</a>
<P>

18   	Mr Harrison SC says that the agreement embodied in the
short minutes is one which offends against <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lata1948257/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20</a> as an agreement by which a
person seeks to avoid the operation of the Act.
<P>

19   	There is no evidence at all to suggest that either of the
parties to the agreement intended to avoid the operation of the
Act.  Mr
Harrison SC, however, submits that the word "seeks" covers not only a person
who has the intention when he or she makes
an agreement, but also a person who
entered into an agreement the natural result of which is to avoid the operation
of the Act.
<P>

20   	In the limited time that I have had available I have
endeavoured to see whether past courts have construed the word "seeks"
in this
way, and have found no assistance.  The nearest one can get is in<b> Plier v
Trumble</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281873%29%204%20AJR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1873) 4 AJR 26</a>, the Full Court held in Victoria that there was a
very real difference between pursuing game and seeking game.  However, it seems
to me that bearing in mind the whole purpose of the Act Mr Harrison SC's
contention is likely to be correct.
<P>

21   	The terms of short minutes of order operate both as an
order of the court and also as a contract.  Insofar as they operate
as a
contract, it would seem to me that the undertaking not to bring a further
application, if the Act gives the right, would be
something which would be
affected.  However, whether that be right or not, the fact that the plaintiffs
are in breach of the undertaking
to give vacant possession, and the clear
intent of them submitting to the order on 12 May, is reason why this Court
should not in
its discretion give any relief by way of injunction.
<P>

22   	It should be made one hundred percent clear that the way
in which this Court has been able to function over many years is
because any
orders and undertakings given to it are very strictly policed and that people
know if they breach an order or breach
an undertaking the serious consequences
that that would have.  The court will not be involved in granting injunctions
to people who
are in that position, except in the most extraordinary case.  Mr
Harrison SC is right when he says there has not as yet been any
application to
enforce the undertaking, but that makes little difference for present
purposes.
<P>

23   	There was, as I indicated earlier, an application for
release from the undertaking and there was some suggestion that the
plaintiffs
were people of little education who made the promise to the court in the
expectation that they would have new finance,
but there is nothing in those
statements which would warrant the release from the undertakings.
<P>

24   	The application for a declaration is a different matter.
An application for a declaration is not an application for equitable
relief and
although the court has a discretion as to whether or not it makes a
declaration, the court ought not to impose upon a
plaintiff any equitable terms
in making a declaration;<b> Chapman v Michaelson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1909%5d%201%20Ch%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1909] 1 Ch 238.</a>
Furthermore, coming to Equity with clean hands is not a maxim that affects the
common law.
<P>

25   	If the true facts are that this is a farm debt and there
has been no mediation, and if, as I have held, estoppel and res judicata
are
irrelevant, then the result of tomorrow's auction will be void and the
auctioneer and the defendant will be committing conversion
of the plaintiffs'
properties and the purchaser will get no title.
<P>

26   	Accordingly, despite the conduct of the plaintiffs, it
would seem to me that some declaration should be made in the interests
of
all.
<P>

27   	However, the making of a declaration is a matter of
discretion and I am extremely loathe to make a declaration in terms of
paras 1
and 2 of the summons because that might be very unfair to the defendant.  This
is because he really has not had a lot of
opportunity to put on evidence
dealing with the true facts and it may be that, if he had have had that
opportunity the court would
see clearly that this was a case where for instance
there had in fact been mediation.
<P>

28   	Accordingly, I believe the appropriate thing to do is
merely stand the suit over.
<P>

29   	I have no power to make an interim declaration, but I will
note on the papers that the court notes that on the material before
it at
present the proposed action by the defendant to sell the property at auction
tomorrow is void. I will stand the suit over into
the Registrar's list.
<P>

[Mr Harrison sought order 3 in the summons]
<P>

30   	I stand the matter over to Friday 30 July before the
Registrar at 9.30 am and note that I regard my intervention today as,
although
technically a final hearing, it is more of an interlocutory nature and there is
no problem about the next round of these
proceedings being heard by a different
judge.   I reserve the costs.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>

                                             oOo
