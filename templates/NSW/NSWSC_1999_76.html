<P>

	<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	On 4 November 1997 the plaintiff instituted proceedings for damages for
defamation arising from what is alleged to have been a
publication by the
defendants of two articles in the "<i>Nea Patrida"</i> newspaper ("<i>New
Country</i>"), on 9 and 10 August 1997.
<P>

2	The first matter complained of bears, in English, a headline "<i>The New
Uproar with Mrs Ieremia and the Former Husband's Translation"</i>.  The
plaintiff contends that this matter complained of conveys of her the following
defamatory imputations:
<P>

	<i>"5(a)	that the plaintiff broke the obligations of her office as the Consul
General of Greece by deliberately disclosing confidential
information which she
learned as Consul;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that the plaintiff is corrupt in that she was bribed to enable matters
to be expedited through the Consulate of Greece;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	that the plaintiff participated in a tax scam involving the sale of a
consular vehicle;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	that the plaintiff was a dishonest person in that she was prepared to
claim exclusive credit for work which had in fact be (</i>sic<i>) done jointly
with her husband;</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	the plaintiff broke the obligations of her marriage by having an
illicit sexual affair with a man while living with her husband;</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	that the plaintiff neglected her duties as Consul General of Greece by
working as a tax driver and performing other errands at
the behest of her new
lover".</i>
<P>

3	The second matter complained of bears a headline (in English) "<i>New Uproar
with Ieremia"</i>.  This article is said to convey the following imputations
defamatory of the plaintiff:
<P>

	<i>"8(a)	That the plaintiff broke the obligations of her office as the Consul
General of Greece by deliberately disclosing confidential
information which she
learned as Consul;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that the plaintiff committed a criminal breach of Australian law by
unlawfully discriminating against three priests at a function
at the Lemnian
Club on 7 August 1997;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	that the plaintiff as Greek Consul had brought public disgrace on all
Greeks living in Australia because of her actions on three
separate occasions
at the Greek Community Club, Martin Place and the Lemnian Club;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	that the plaintiff behaved in an improper manner at the Greek Community
Club shocking those who observed it including Greek Priests".</i>
<P>

4	None of the material provided for the plaintiff during the course of the
argument of her Motion for Expedition explains the delay
between the
publication and institution of the action.  The only thing that can be said in
this regard is that the proceedings were
instituted five days after the
certification of the translation (30 October 1997), of each of the articles as
evidenced by annexures
"B" and "D" to the Statement of Claim.  The lapse of
time between 10 August and 30 October is unexplained by the plaintiff (see
paragraph
26 below).
<P>

5	In an affidavit sworn 24 December 1998 Mr Lazaropoulos deposes to the service
of the pleading on the defendants on 11 November
1997.  On 23 December the
defendants' solicitor wrote to the solicitors for the plaintiff in respect of
the defendants' complaints
about the imputations and three months later (23
March 1998), correspondence was received from the plaintiff's solicitors.
<P>

6	A Defence was filed on 15 May 1998 pleading privilege, comment and
justification.
<P>

7	In the meantime the matter had been in the Defamation List on 28 November
1997 on which occasion Consent Orders and Directions
were made.  None of those
orders were complied with in terms of the time limits between 28 November 1997
and the filing of the Defence;
 the Defence was due to be filed by 19 December
1997.  A Reply to the Defence was not filed until 13 October 1998.
<P>

8	Again, in the meantime the matter had been in the Defamation List on 3 April
1998 (Newman J), on which occasion it was stood over
for "<i>argument</i>" to
17 April 1998.  On that day further orders and directions were made.  The first
such order was that the plaintiff was to supply
particulars of the Statement of
Claim by 24 April 1998 and that the defendants were to file their Defence by 8
May.
<P>

9	On 15 May 1998 I granted leave to the defendants to file the Defence in Court
and varied the orders made on 17 April to permit
the plaintiff to request
particulars of that pleading by 20 May;  otherwise, the orders previously made
were to remain in place.
<P>

10	On 16 June the matter was stood over to 26 June 1998 on which occasion
before Machonachie AJ orders by consent were made and
directions given for the
further conduct of the matter requiring the defendants to provide particulars
of their defences by 5pm on
29 June. 
<P>

11	On 30 October 1998 the matter was again before the Court and orders were
made by me as to the defendants requesting particulars
of the Reply and the
provision thereof, and the delivery of a Verified List of Documents by 20
November.  The matter was listed for
further directions on 27 November on which
occasion the plaintiff had still not filed her List of Documents and was
ordered to do
so by 4 December.  The matter was stood over to the Directions
List on 11 December 1998 and directions were given that in the event
that the
plaintiff proposed to move the Court for expedition, the plaintiff was granted
leave to file a Notice of Motion returnable
on that day, such Notice of Motion
and any evidence in support to be served on the defendants by 9 December.
Other orders were made
in relation to an anticipated dispute as to particulars
of the Reply, being orders in the usual form in the Defamation List requiring
provision of a document crystallising the issues on that subject.  On 11
December 1998 (the last Defamation List day of that year)
I granted an
adjournment of the hearing of the Notice of Motion for expedition on the
application of the defendants.  I also granted
the defendants leave to file in
Court a Notice of Motion.  That Notice of Motion sought leave to the defendants
to file a cross-claim
and subsidiary orders relating to the Reply by the
plaintiff being struck out or alternatively that further particulars of that
pleading
be provided and that there be further and better discovery by the
plaintiff in accordance with some request made by the defendants
on 9 December
1998.
<P>

12	On 2 February 1999 I heard the Notice of Motion for expedition.
<P>

13	On 9 December 1998 the solicitors for the defendants, at my request,
provided to me a bundle of correspondence between the parties
relating to the
particulars of the Defence (the correspondence proceeds from 20 May 1998 to 3
December 1998) and relating to the
particulars of the Reply (the correspondence
proceeds from 4 November 1998 to 4 December 1998).  As stated above, the
Defence was
filed on 15 May 1998;  on 20 May 1998 the plaintiff's solicitors
request further and better particulars of the pleading (in a letter
sixteen
pages in length).  A reply to that letter is dated 23 July 1998 (eleven pages).
In the last mentioned letter the defendants
refused to provide certain
particulars and on specified grounds.  The letter contains one curious
component namely, that in respect
of two of the imputations to which the
pleaded defence of justification relates, it is stated that the "<i>defendants
do not plead justification to this imputation, subject to discovery and
interrogatories".</i>  No doubt the plaintiff will make some use of this on the
question of damages in due course.
<P>

14	By letter dated 11 November 1998 the solicitors for the plaintiff raised
objections to certain components of the defendants'
solicitors letter supplying
particulars to which a reply promptly was sent on 12 November 1998.
<P>

15	It thus can be seen that there has been fault on both sides in the vigorous
prosecution both of the action and the defence.
<P>

16	By Notice of Motion filed on 9 December the plaintiff seeks that the
proceedings be expedited.  In addition, she seeks consequential
orders
requiring particulars of the Defence and further discovery, and directions as
to the administration of interrogatories.
<P>

17	The affidavit evidence in support of the application was constituted by two
affidavits sworn by Mr Xenos, solicitor for the plaintiff
dated 9 and 22
December 1998.  These affidavits and the affidavits on behalf of the defendants
contained a lot of argumentative material
and in respect of the latter
material, some was simply not admitted.  
<P>

18	The plaintiff is a Greek citizen residing in Australia and is a permanent
public servant of the Greek Republic.  She is a member
of the Diplomatic
Service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is the Greek Consul-General in
Sydney.  The plaintiff was initially
posted to Australia on 22 September 1986;
she remained here until 27 March 1991 at which time she was posted to
Stuttgart, Germany.
 She returned to Australia on 22 September 1994 and has
been resident here since that date.
<P>

19	On or about 16 November 1998 the plaintiff received a communication from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece (relevant
parts of which are annexed to
the first affidavit of Mr Xenos as "A") relating to the transfer of consular
officers.  The plaintiff
has made inquiries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in Greece the outcome of which is the possibility of her being posted outside
of Australia, in all probability to Greece, in December of 1999.  The plaintiff
has been advised and I accept that it is the policy
of the Greek Foreign
Affairs Department to transfer diplomats in the northern hemisphere at a time
that coincides with the school
year there which ends in June and to transfer
diplomats in the southern hemisphere to coincide with the end of the school
year in
December.
<P>

20	The likely date of the plaintiff's posting out of Australia and more
probably than not to the Greece is no later than 31 December.
<P>

21	The plaintiff is the mother of and sole care-giver to her four children the
oldest of whom was born on 31 July 1984.  It is contended
that if the hearing
of this matter does not take place before the plaintiff leaves Australia
permanently (her residential status
here is dependent upon her diplomatic
function), she will encounter "<i>significant difficulties</i>" in the care of
her children during the course of the hearing of any trial.  The plaintiff will
be required to take annual leave
to attend the hearing and that will
substantially exhaust the time she will be able to spend with and care for her
family during
such period of leave which is four weeks per year.  The three
younger children were all born in Australia and know no other place
than this
country as "<i>home</i>".  It is contended in the affidavits that if the
plaintiff is posted to Greece there will be significant dislocation experienced
by the children in settling in to a new country and culture.  This, of course,
is a reality that will be confronted by the plaintiff
at the end of 1999
presumably irrespective the fact that she has on foot defamation proceedings in
New South Wales.  I gather the
point sought to be made is that the dislocation
referred to will be, as-it-were, aggravated by the plaintiff having to leave
the
children to come back to Australia to litigate her case.
<P>

22	An important point is made and one that can be understood namely, that the
plaintiff wishes to leave Australia having resolved
the matter.  The
imputations against her both personally and in her capacity as a consular
officer are very serious and it is her
wish to leave this country and her
acquaintances and colleagues in Australia as a "<i>vindicated person"</i>.
<P>

23	Mr Xenos also swears as to his involvement as solicitor for the plaintiff,
his client's continual expression of interest in the
progress of the
litigation, and to his absence from the country on certain occasion which has
interfered with his attendance to various
aspects of the interlocutory
proceedings.  One example of the last is that upon his return to Australia from
overseas on 20 January
he sought counsel's advice as to alleged deficiencies in
the imputations which had been raised by the defendants.  Apparently, that
advice was not received until 18 March.
<P>

24	The plaintiff seeks expedition because in the ordinary course of listing, it
is said, the matter will not be heard before the
plaintiff leaves the country
at the end of December 1999.  He is further instructed by the plaintiff that it
would be inconvenient
to her work duties for her to conduct the proceedings
after 1999 when she will have been posted outside of Australia.  
<P>

25	Mr Lazaropoulos, solicitor for the defendants, swore an affidavit on 24
December 1998 annexed to which is a most useful and detailed
chronology. 
<P>

26	It is Mr Lazaropoulos' affidavit that provides some explanation (from the
defendants) as to the lapse of time between the date
of publication and the
institution of proceedings.  It appears that following the publication on 9
August 1997 it was not until 25
September that a letter of complaint was
written for the plaintiff which received a reply on the same date.
<P>

27	Mr Lazaropoulos identifies what are said to be periods of undue delay on the
part of the plaintiff:  the first period is from
9 August 1997 to 11 November
1997, that is the date of publication to the date of service of the Statement
of Claim.  Next, the defendants
complained of the plaintiff's imputations on 23
December which did not elicit a reply until 23 March 1998 (three months).  On
17
April a Reply was ordered, by consent, to be filed by 5 June, an unsealed
copy was delivered on 30 September, the Reply was filed
on 13 October and a
sealed copy served on 3 November 1998.  It is contended that in the period 23
July 1998 and 30 September 1998
there was no activity by the plaintiff (two
months).  On 23 July 1998 particulars of the Defence were delivered and
objections were
taken to these only on 11 November 1998 (four months).  On 19
November the defendants served its Verified List of Documents, the
plaintiff
did not serve hers until 4 December;  the plaintiff did not request inspection
of the defendants' documents until 9 December.
 The balance of Mr Lazaropoulos'
affidavit is essentially argumentative by way of submissions.  He does however
swear that on 24
December he spoke with the List Clerk of the Common Law
Division and was informed that on the basis that the action would be a "<i>long
matter</i>" the absolute earliest that it could be heard with expedition is the
beginning of the Law Term in the year 2000.  Even with an order
for expedition,
it is contended, the action would not be listed for hearing before the end of
1999 at which time the plaintiff will
be out of the jurisdiction.
<P>

28	The next affidavit on which the defendants sought to rely was that of
Michael Mystakidis, the editor of the "<i>New Country</i>" published by the
defendants.  The bulk of this affidavit, informative though it might be, is
such as to attract little or no weight,
it being argumentative, speculative,
containing inadmissible hearsay and indeed, I made specific rulings in regard
thereto.  It purports
to cover the behaviour of the plaintiff and give some
evidence of her income (the plaintiff was silent in that regard), what is said
to be her intervention in matters internal to the Greek community in this
country relating to the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese and
the Greek Orthodox
Community, the plaintiff's personal and marital history, and a purported
exposition of what is said to be Greek
law relating to Ministry of Foreign
Affairs appointments.  Nothing in this affidavit save for deposing to the
publication in the
defendants' newspaper "<i>Greek Herald</i>" of the fact that
the plaintiff was likely to be recalled to Greece, is of any relevance or
assistance.
<P>

29	The third affidavit on which the defendants rely is that of one John Jacmon,
by occupation a consulting psychologist, who on
31 July 1995 married the
plaintiff.  I am prepared to accept this deponent's statement that at the time
of his marriage to the plaintiff
the plaintiff had the custody of her four
children all born to her during her previous marriage to one Athanassios
Priantafyllou.
 The plaintiff's marriage to Mr Priantafyllou came to an end
during her posting in Stuttgart and in September 1994 the plaintiff
and her
four children and the plaintiff's parents came to Canberra following her
posting there as the Counsellor at the Greek Embassy.
 The plaintiff's first
husband resides in Athens and he had visited his children in Canberra in 1996.
During the time of the deponent's
marriage to her, the plaintiff's parents
lived with them and returned to Greece in April 1997.
<P>

30	This deponent purports to give evidence about the financial affairs of the
plaintiff and of an instance where the plaintiff had
to return to Greece for
certain other litigation during which period her parents looked after the
children.  I gather from that the
inference is to be drawn are that in the
reverse situation, namely, the plaintiff having to leave Greece to come to
Sydney for this
litigation, her parents would be available to look after the
children.
<P>

31	For the plaintiff, it is argued, that each case at first instance must be
judged on its merits.  With that proposition I agree.
 This is the "<i>first
bite of the cherry</i>" and the considerations which excite the Court of Appeal
in determining priorities on an expedition application to that Court are
not
essentially applicable (see <b><i>Elders Rural Finance Limited v Smith &amp;
Ors</i></b> (Court of Appeal, unreported, 12 December 1995 and <b><i>New South
Wales Small Bore &amp; Air Rifle Association v Commonwealth of
Australia</i></b> (Court of Appeal, Cole JA, unreported, 11 March 1996).  
<P>

32	It is argued that the imputations pleaded are very serious imputations.
This is so.  The degree of seriousness varies with respect
to personal conduct
and professional conduct.  The defendants is justifying, so it appears, save
for the position taken by the defendants
to which I have referred, where it is
in some way seeking to "<i>defer</i>" its case on justification until discovery
and interrogatories.  As I have remarked and indeed, as Mr Henskens commented,
this is
a rather extraordinary position to take.  Either the defendants is
justifying or it is not.  The "<i>suspense</i>" arising from the equivocal
position taken by the defendants is a factor that is no doubt of concern to the
plaintiff and certainly
could be a factor upon which the plaintiff can rely in
aggravation of damages.
<P>

33	The delays, if any, on the part of the plaintiff are not significant, it is
submitted, there have equally been delays on the
part of the defendants.  Of
this I am not persuaded and will return to it shortly.
<P>

34	It is argued and rightly so, that upon the plaintiff receiving notification
of the likelihood of her transfer from the jurisdiction
she promptly informed
the defendants and the Court of her intention to apply for expedition.  The
plaintiff cannot be criticised
in that regard.
<P>

35	The plaintiff is desirous of having her reputation vindicated while she
still occupies the office of Consul General for Greece
in Sydney.  That the
plaintiff desires this is perfectly understandable.  By itself it is incapable
of being sufficient reason to
expedite the hearing of the action which might
lead to such vindication.  The reality is of course that in the event of her
trial
not being fixed while she is in the country but rather in being heard
while she is resident abroad and thus requiring her attendance
in Sydney, the
vindication she might well receive will nonetheless still be public and it will
be in the context of her having been
Consul General in Sydney.
<P>

36	It is argued that there is a factor common between the plaintiff's action
and those actions in which expedition usually is sought
in the Common Law
Division.  Expedition is usually sought when, to put it starkly, the life of a
party is in peril of ending before
the case is heard.  It might be the case
that ill health or a sudden deterioration in the psychological condition of a
party intervenes.
 That which is in common is said to be the intervention of a
factor over which the litigant has no control.  In this case, the factor
over
which she has no control is her posting out of Sydney.  In regard to the fact
that the plaintiff is to be posted out of Sydney
I do take account of the
evidence from her solicitor to that effect;  as a matter of common sense, by
reason of her career in the
diplomatic service of her country and by reason of
the evidence of her having been posted in Stuttgart, Melbourne and Canberra it
must be assumed by a person in the position of the plaintiff that at some time
or other, her positing will in fact change.  I am
not persuaded that there is
sufficient <i>"commonality</i>" between the plaintiff's position in this regard
and the position of a dying plaintiff in a personal injuries or medical
negligence
case.  I acknowledge the decision on the part of the Department of
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Greece to put in train the
posting change
was no doubt beyond the control of the plaintiff.  But such a governmental
action cannot be characterised in the same
way on any sensible and rational
basis as the intervention of ill health beyond the control of the litigant that
might properly found
an application for expedition.  I make it clear in this
context that I have had no regard to the material contained in the affidavit
of
Mr Lazaropoulos or indeed, Mr Mystakidis or the plaintiff's former husband, Mr
Jacmon which purport to inform the Court of matters
of law or policy relating
to the procedures adopted by the Department of Foreign Affairs of Greece in
relation to the movement of
its diplomats.  I have had regard to what Mr Jacmon
has said as to his experience in relation to the actual movements of the
plaintiff.
 The statements by the newspaper editor however, as to the law and
as to policy should, of their very nature, but meaning no disrespect
to the
deponent, receive scant if any weight in an application of this kind.  
<P>

37	It is submitted for the plaintiff that in the event of her action coming on
for trial after she leaves the country she will be
inconvenienced in many
respects - geographic, financial and familial.  As was stated for the
defendants the costs of her coming to
litigate and litigate successfully her
claim will, of course, be met by the defendants.  There is some material that
indicates that
the arrangements in relation to the children could be attended
to by the plaintiff's parents but the dislocation to the children
themselves
will be inevitable in a career followed by that chosen by the plaintiff.
<P>

38	It is further argued that there is a peculiar and particular component to be
considered in the context of what is described as
the possibility of the
plaintiff being "<i>denied access to justice"</i>:  this is the fact that the
defendants are vigorously opposing the plaintiff's application.  It is not
unusual for a respondent to
an application for expedition to take a
"<i>neutral</i>" position and leave the decision to the Court without making
submissions.  A respondent of course, is not precluded from opposing
an
application for expedition when it perceives that as a matter of principle and
policy there is really no foundation for the plaintiff
seeking the indulgence
of leap-frogging the list and disadvantaging either other litigants or more
importantly, the respondent by
unduly forcing the respondent to take steps in
preparation of its case.  The fact of the defendants opposing the application
is a
departure from the usual course of events.  The aggressiveness and vigour
with which the application was opposed could be explained,
I suppose, by reason
of the very nature of the allegations made and sought to be proved to be true.
This case involves the personal
and professional conduct of the plaintiff in at
least one sensitive area affecting the Greek community in this country in
connection
with the authority of the Greek Archdiocese or the Greek Orthodox
Community.  I am not impressed by the submission in this context.
 Clearly the
litigation of the action will involve the ventilation of all these issues.  The
defendants will seek leave to cross-claim
against the plaintiff in respect to
the publication of certain remarks she is reported to have made on 28 November
1998 to the publisher
of another Greek language newspaper.  This type of
conduct, namely, the intention to institute a cross-claim, it is argued,
indicates
an approach being adopted by the defendants conformably with its
vigorous opposition to the current application that will seek to
ensure that
the plaintiff will never have an action for trial or if she does, never have
any benefit of any verdict she might obtain.
 I did not hear any application on
the part of the defendants on its Motion for leave to file a cross-claim.  I am
not prepared to
make any ruling as to "<i>motives</i>" on the part of that side
of the record.
<P>

39	It is further contended that unlike personal injury litigation a plaintiff
in a defamation action is confronted by what was described
as a forbidding
judicial process with many hurdles to cross (in this case thus far various
hurdles have been raised and are yet to
be crossed), and thus it is desirable
that the plaintiff be in a position personally to instruct her legal advisers.
That again,
is a desirable or "<i>preferred</i>" position.  Its
non-availability however cannot be conclusive in favour of expedition.  One
must make some acknowledgment of the
real world's facilities for communication
whether by telephone, facsimile, e-mail and the like.  Once the case is
prepared by the
legal advisers upon instructions received from the plaintiff
and (in the event of non-expedition), it is ready for hearing, arrangements
can
well be made for its positive fixture on very strict terms to enable the
plaintiff to attend personally on her legal advisers
for the final preparation
for the trial.
<P>

40	For the defendants Ms Gibson argued that the foundation for the application
for expedition was simply "<i>convenience</i>"; and it was "<i>convenience for
a plaintiff who has not vigorously pursued her action and indeed, delayed in
its commencement</i>".
<P>

41	Ms Gibson pointed to the promulgation of Practice Note 14 in relation to the
Defamation List and made the submission, with which
I agree, that the function
of that List is in effect to ensure expedition of the proceedings.  I will not
venture to remark upon
the degree of success that List has had in that regard.
In written submissions it is suggested by Ms Gibson that by reason of the
operation of SCR Pt 67 certain procedures outside that Part are not available
in actions subject to that part (for example, default
judgment:  <b><i>Altarama
Limited v Forsyth</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20NSWLR%20188" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 NSWLR 188).</a>  This proposition advanced by Ms
Gibson can be taken to be correct but in very few and specified areas.  I would
certainly not hold
that the conduct of a defamation action through the
Defamation List and the application of SCR Pt 67 precludes a plaintiff from
making
an application for expedition, indeed, in <b><i>Marsden v Amalgamated
Television Services Pty Limited</i></b>(unreported, 5 May 1998), I entertained
such an application on behalf of the plaintiff and granted it.
<P>

42	Reference was made to this decision in the course of submissions and the
circumstances attending Mr Marsden's application are
quite distinguishable from
that presently under consideration.  In Mr Marsden's case there was evidence of
continuing damage to reputation,
of being shunned and avoided, and of adverse
effects on the psychological condition of the plaintiff.  Furthermore, the
defendants
did not oppose the application.  The factors to which I referred in
<b><i>Marsden</i></b> point to it being the very kind of case in which a
plaintiff may well and justifiably be moved to seek the relief from the Court
of the kind now being sought.  
<P>

43	I was referred by Ms Gibson to a decision of Young J in <b><i>Greetings
Oxford Koala Hotel Pty Limited v Oxford Square Investments Pty Limited</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 33</a> particularly at 42 and 43 where his Honour, in the context
of an application for expedition in the Equity Division, set out six factors
to
be taken into account and adverted to a seventh being the prospects of success
of the suit.  Many of the considerations to which
his Honour referred are
inapplicable in a defamation action unless exceptional circumstances establish
otherwise:  for example, there
are large sums of money involved (usually the
"<i>large sums</i>" are whatever is ultimately awarded by way of damages;  it
is an exceptional case in which there is a claim for "<i>special damages</i>").
Another factor his Honour took into account and one would think rightly so in
the Equity Division, is the risk that the subject
matter of the litigation will
be lost if the case is not heard quickly - there may be property rights that
require special consideration
or matters involving children.  Otherwise, his
Honour refers generally to matters that are for consideration in this kind of
application:
 whether the matter is of public importance, whether the
litigation has been delayed through no fault of the applicant (which I find
not
to be the case here), that the applicant is suffering hardship, there is no
evidence of that:  the evidence points to "<i>inconvenience</i>" in having to
return to this country to hear the action.  Have the parties proceeded up to
the date of the hearing of the Motion
for expedition with due speed?  (at 42G)
- this is the third factor to which his Honour refers;  in this case, certainly
the plaintiff
has not and it is arguable that the defendants has not.  There
has been no specific indication in this application that if expedition
were
granted that the parties would do all in their power.  I have no doubt that
they would.  One area which seems to be in dispute
is, for example, whether or
not all issues of fact and law are to be tried by the judge pursuant to s 89 of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> (that is, that the jury be dispensed with).  This
is a case in which one could come to the view that it is hardly arguable that
the
matters complained of convey defamatory imputations of the substance of
which the plaintiff complains.  Would it really be necessary
for a jury to
determine that and for any time to be taken, if there is any dispute (and there
is no indication thus far, as I understand
it), as to translations?
<P>

44	Given the uncertain status of the defence in relation to justification of
two serious imputations relating to illegal corruption
and illegal tax schemes
said to have been engaged upon by the plaintiff, arguably from the perspective
of the present, the plaintiff's
chances of success are certainly more than
"<i>speculative</i>" (and may well be viewed as being of some substance).
<P>

45	It was suggested in the course of submissions for the defendants that one
reason the plaintiff was making this application was
to avoid an application by
the defendants for security for costs in the event of the plaintiff leaving the
jurisdiction.  Again,
and this time vis-a-vis the plaintiff I propose to make
no finding as to the motivation in this regard.
<P>

46	I am persuaded in the end however, that there is merit in Ms Gibson's
submission that fundamentally the foundation for this application
is
"<i>convenience</i>".  A defamation action is brought to vindicate the
aggrieved party's reputation.  It is expected that the action will be promptly
brought and vigorously prosecuted on the part of the plaintiff and it is
expected that the defendants will take the same approach
to the prosecution of
its defences.  The Defamation List has been established to provide, as best it
can (without being a case management
list), a mechanism for expedition by the
giving of directions as to the conduct of cases and the hearing of
interlocutory arguments
the disposal of which should operate in aid of the
speedy preparation of a defamation action for trial and which should also
operate
to avoid the trial being unduly disrupted by late applications.
<P>

47	Mere "<i>inconvenience</i>" and some disruption to one's personal affairs
including the necessity to travel from abroad to have a case heard, by
themselves
are not sufficient to warrant expedition to the disadvantage of
other cases in the list of actions to be heard by this Division,
other cases
which no doubt involve equal if not greater urgency in terms of damages for
people who have suffered grave physical injury.
 Matters of
<i>"convenience</i>" are less likely to be of weight in circumstances where the
parties seeking the indulgence of the Court and advancement of the hearing
of
an action to the prejudice of other actions waiting to be heard has not pursued
the case with vigour, the more so when it was
not initiated with promptitude
and has not availed itself of the facilities of a List the essence of which is
to provide an expedited
process.  If a party can be criticised for those
reasons, it must be taken into account, if it be the case, and it is the case
in
this instance, that the defendants have from time to time delayed.  The
delays on the part of the defendants I do not find to have
been deliberate,
obstructive or of such a kind as artificially and without merit to place in the
path of the plaintiff obstacles
in her quest for vindication.  One thing that
can be said is that every case in this Court is of critical importance to the
litigants
involved.  Bearing that in mind the Court must be jealous in the
allocation of its finite and thus precious resources to the disposal
of the
hearing of cases and must do so in a way that is efficient, fair and just.  If
a party seeks a special indulgence the granting
of which would have the
practical effect of constituting a departure by the Court from the processing
of its case load in accordance
with the principles to which I have just
referred, an especial case must be made.  This is particularly so in the
Defamation List
by reason of the nature of the List and it is particularly so
in Defamation actions particularly by reason of the very nature of
such
actions.  
<P>

48	I am not persuaded that any of the matters to which Mr Henskens referred in
arguing his client's cause in the end elevates the
application above one based
on matters of simple "<i>convenience</i>".  Whilst the Court recognises that in
the event of this case not being heard before the plaintiff's departure there
will be "<i>inconvenience</i>" and <i>"disruption</i>" for the plaintiff, a
case has not been made out in respect to such components that warrants the
order the plaintiff seeks.
<P>

49	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The application for expedition is dismissed.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of that application.
<P>

3.	I stand the matter over to the Defamation List on 5 March 1999 for further
directions.
