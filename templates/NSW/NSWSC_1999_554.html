<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Discovery - aircraft crash)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 24 November 1998, the
plaintiffs sought discovery against the defendants pursuant to Pt 23 r 3(1) of
the
<b>Supreme Court Rules</b> (the Rules).  Part 23 r 3(5) requires special
circumstances to be shown before an order for discovery can be made in personal
injury
matters.  The parties agree that there are special circumstances in this
case.  The plaintiffs and the second defendant have agreed
upon the documents
the second defendant will provide to the plaintiff by way of discovery.  The
first and third defendants have agreed
on certain documents being made
available to the plaintiff by way of discovery. That leaves a few categories of
documents that remain
in dispute and are the subject of this judgment.
<P>

2  	On 13 July 1995 the first plaintiff Donald Carl Cooke was being
instructed by the third plaintiff Clark Lee Gibbons in relation
to a dual
instrument flight rules (IFR) training flight, including aerial work at
Goulburn followed by two practice instrument landing
system (ILS) approaches at
Canberra Airport before returning to Bankstown Airport.  After completion of
the second ILS approach,
the first plaintiff was instructed by Canberra
Approach to carry out a missed approach and climb to 7,000 feet. They were
flying
a Cessna model P210N registration No VH-SMA (the aircraft).  Robert
Cooke, the second plaintiff and the son of the first plaintiff
was a passenger
in the aircraft.  As the aircraft was levelling in instrument meteorological
conditions (IMC), Clark Gibbons noticed
that Engine Manifold Absolute Pressure
(MAP) had reduced from 30 inches to 25 inches.  Donald Cooke had not adjusted
the power and
informed Clark Gibbons of this.  At 1127 hours Clark Gibbons
advised Canberra Approach that the aircraft had experienced a loss of
power.
The location of this was approximately 38.8 kilometres north east of Canberra
Airport, near Lake George.  The plaintiff alleges
that the third or fourth
defendants assumed the operational control of the aircraft and in doing so
became responsible for the safety
of the aircraft and its occupants.
<P>

3  	The pilot contemplated a water landing in Lake George and
believed that the air traffic controller was directing him to it.
 At the time,
visibility was poor.  The plaintiffs allege that the air traffic controller
failed to direct the aircraft to a lake
as requested so that a water landing
could be conducted but instead direction vectors were given to the aircraft
which ultimately
resulted in the aircraft crashing in high terrain in an area
about 1,000 metres north of Lake George.  Upon impact the aircraft caught
fire
and exploded resulting in the aircraft's total destruction and severe personal
injury to the aircraft's three occupants, Donald
Cooke, Robert Cooke and Clark
Gibbons.
<P>

4  	On about 20 August 1987 the first defendant Hawker Pacific Pty
Limited "bulk stripped" the aircraft pursuant to an agreement
for the supply of
maintenance services (the Bulk Strip agreement).  The allegations of negligence
against the first defendant is
contained in para 31 of the statement of claim.
It is alleged that the crash involving the aircraft was caused by reason of
breaches
of the duty of care which the defendants owed to the plaintiff as
pilots and/or passengers in the aircraft.  
<P>

5  	The particulars of negligence are that the first defendant failed
to take and or any adequate precautions for the safety of
the plaintiffs,
exposed the plaintiffs to a risk of injury which could have been avoided by
reasonable care;  failed to use all reasonable
care and skill in the
performance of a bulk strip upon the piston engine of the aircraft;  failed to
pay careful attention and critically
measure the bearing tunnels of the said
engine in order to ensure bearing security;  failed to ensure that there was no
bearing movement
in the said engine during the bulk strip;  failed to line the
bore and take a full measurement of the crankcase and crankcase tunnels
of the
engine to ensure bearing security and failed to properly identify that the
bearing tunnels of the engine were too large which
allowed the bearing to move
inside the bearing tunnels compromising bearing security and consequently
causing oil starvation, then
engine seizure and failure of the said engine.
<P>

6  	An examination of Continental engine failure of the aircraft by R
T Southin dated August 1996 (Ex 1D 2) cites the cause of the
engine failure was
insufficient torque having been applied to the through bolts when they were
last tightened.  This allowed fretting
of the mating surfaces which further
reduced the clamping pressure until this was so low that the bearing shells in
main bearing
number 2 rotated.  This rotation resulted in reduced oil flow in
most areas around the crankshaft which in turn caused seizing and
finally
complete engine failure.  The maintenance records show that the through bolts
would have last been tightened by Reliance
about 230 hours flying time prior to
the accident.
<P>

7  	The plaintiffs seek documents referred to in schedule (1) para
(a) of the short minutes of order.  Those documents are:
<P>

<b>"(a)	Reports, manuals, procedural manuals, maintenance schedules,
guidelines, recommendations, memoranda, manufacturer's guidelines,
manufacturer's procedural manuals and all documents relating to "Bulk Strip" of
all Teledyne Continental Motors TSIO-520F engines
fitted to Cessna P210N
aircraft or other aircraft for the period of 1987 to 1998."</b>
<P>

8  	TSIO-520F should read TSIO-520P.  The first defendant has
indicated that it will produce all overhaul manuals, parts catalogues,
service
bulletins and airworthiness directives relating to bulk strip of Teledyne
Continental Motors TS10-520P engines fitted to
Cessna P210N aircraft or other
aircraft for the period of 1987 to 1998.
<P>

9  	The first defendant submitted that the categories of documents
that it is prepared to discover cover all the procedures that
it followed and
should have followed when it bulk stripped the engine.  If there had been any
problems experienced with this type
of engine, details of the problem would
have appeared in the bulletins and airworthiness directions.  The first
defendant has included
these documents in the categories of documents it is
prepared to discover.  Although there is no evidence, the first defendant's
counsel submitted from the bar table that the first defendant undertakes
between 40-60 bulk strips per year so they would need to
produce between
400-600 lots of records.  
<P>

10  	It is my view that the plaintiff has not discharged its onus and
demonstrated that the general documents referred to in para
(a) relating to the
Teledyne Continental Motors TSIO 520P engines are relevant to the issues in
dispute.  It seems that to require
these documents to be produced involves a
fishing exercise.
<P>

11  	In relation to the third defendant, the allegations of
negligence also appear at para 31 of the statement of claim and say
that
further or in the alternative and at all material times the third defendant
failed to take any or any adequate precautions for
the safety of the
plaintiffs;  exposed the plaintiffs to a risk of injury which could have been
avoided by reasonable care;  notwithstanding
an express request to do so,
failing to provide the pilot in command, Clark Gibbons, with a direction vector
that would have directed
the aircraft to Lake George so that a water landing
could be conducted;  failing to provide the pilot in command with information
that was accurate;  failing to provide the pilot in command, with warning of a
known danger, namely, the high terrain in the area
of the said crash;
directing the aircraft into mountainous and wooded terrain unsuitable for an
emergency landing;  failing to direct
the aircraft to low terrain where the
pilot's visibility would have been achieved and the plaintiffs rely on the
doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.
<P>

12  	The plaintiffs allege that the crash was caused by reason of
breaches of the duty of care which the defendants owed to the
plaintiffs as
pilots and/or passengers in the aircraft.  The plaintiff seeks two categories
of documents.  The first category is
referred to in schedule (3) para (b) of
the document entitled short minutes of order.  It requires the following
documents to be
discovered.  
<P>

<b>"(b)	Documents relating to guidelines, emergency guidelines, emergency
procedures, emergency policies and training of air traffic
controllers in
relation to procedures in responding to distress calls received by an air
traffic controller from an aircraft in the
vicinity of Lake George in the
Australian Capital Territory during the period July 1995 to the
present."</b>
<P>

13  	The third defendant objects to the time period stipulated,
namely from 13 July 1995 to date, but is prepared to produce the
documents
relating to the day of the crash.  The plaintiff submitted that there may have
been changes to the guidelines and procedures
that were introduced as a result
of investigations carried out in relation to the crash.  If changes to
guidelines were made as a
consequence of the crash they are relevant to the
claim of negligence and should be produced.  It is difficult to estimate how
long
any investigations would take.  It is my view that the period stipulated
is allowable.
<P>

14  	The final category of documents in dispute between the
plaintiffs and the third defendant appear in schedule 3 para (c) of
the short
minutes of order.  They are:
<P>

<b>"The following documentation and information relating to the communication
with, obtaining information about and providing information
to aircraft in the
Lake George, Australian Capital Territory, vicinity by air traffic controllers
from 11.00 hours EST on 13 July
1995 to present date:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	Inventories of equipment relating to functions carried out by air
traffic controllers.</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	Technical manuals.</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	Technical specifications.</b>
<P>

<b>(iv)	Guidelines.</b>
<P>

<b> (v)	Procedures and guidelines for use of the equipment.</b>
<P>

<b>(vi)	Training documentation and manuals for use of the equipment."</b>
<P>

15  	The third defendant submitted that firstly, the words "and
information" cannot take the paragraph any further then the preceding
reference
to documents;  secondly, the categories sought appear to refer to all equipment
used in the air traffic control operations
of Airservices Australia and
thirdly, that there is no allegation on the face of the pleadings that
indicates the configuration or
operative capabilities of the equipment used in
any way relevant to these proceedings.  Nor is it alleged that the equipment
was
inappropriately operated.  According to the third defendant para 3(c)
amounts to a fishing expedition, is oppressive on its face
and the descriptions
are so vague as to amount to uncertainty in what is required to be produced.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff submitted that by the general pleading of
negligence the configuration or operative capabilities of the equipment
are in
issue but conceded that the words "and information" could be deleted.  It is my
view that if the plaintiff was seeking to
establish that the equipment was
faulty or the operating capabilities of the equipment were insufficient, these
allegations should
have been pleaded.  I am not satisfied that the documents
sought in schedule 3 para (c) are relevant to the issues in dispute on
the
current pleadings.  Accordingly the third defendant is not obliged to discover
these documents.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff and second defendant have already agreed on an
order for costs in relation to the motion.  The first and third
defendants
submitted that the appropriate order for costs is each party pay its own costs
whereas the plaintiffs submitted that it
was a matter for the court to decide
that discovery ought to be given and the order for costs should be that each
party pay its own
costs.  It appears that the plaintiffs did not attempt to
negotiate discovery with the defendants prior to filing a notice of motion.
After the motion was filed agreements were reached between the parties in
relation to most of the documents sought to be discovered.
 The plaintiffs and
second defendant managed to agree on all documents to be discovered.  It is my
view that although court agreed
with the parties that there were special
circumstances the appropriate order for costs is that costs be costs in the
cause.
<P>

18  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The first defendant is to provide discovery of all overhaul manuals, parts
catalogues, service bulletins and airworthiness directives
relating to bulk
strip of Teledyne Continental Motors TS10-520P engines fitted to Cessna P210N
aircraft or other aircraft for the
period of 1987 to 1998 within 28 days.
<P>

(2)	The third defendant is provide discovery of documents relating to
guidelines, emergency guidelines, emergency procedures, emergency
policies and
training of air traffic controllers in relation to procedures in responding to
distress calls received by an air traffic
controller from an aircraft in the
vicinity of Lake George in the Australian Capital Territory during the period
13 July 1995 to
 date within 2 months.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiffs' and the first and third defendants' costs of the motion be
costs in the cause.
