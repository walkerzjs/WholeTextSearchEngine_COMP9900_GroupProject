<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    These proceedings were listed as an application for
interlocutory injunction before the Duty Judge yesterday.  As a result of
the
settlement of the case in my list, when the proceedings were transferred to me,
with the consent of both parties, the claim for
injunction was heard on a final
basis.
<P>

2	The plaintiff is the service company of a medical centre at Mount Druitt.
The defendant is a registered medical practitioner.
<P>

3	The arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendant is not one which can
easily be classified within traditional categories.
 The evidence shows that
the plaintiff is a company whose sole shareholders and directors are Dr Nihal
Hanna and her husband Mr Nabil
(Bill) Hanna.  They service a medical centre
which at all material times is the workplace for four doctors.  However, there
is no
evidence that there is any contractual or other relationship between
those doctors inter se.  The doctors are not employees of the
plaintiff, in the
sense that none of them receive wages, but the overall centre is organised by
the plaintiff, without, it would
seem, any control by those doctors.  There is
at least consensus amongst the officers of the plaintiff and the doctors as to
the
hours the doctors will work and the amount of annual leave received.
<P>

4	 The evidence shows that the area in question, which is centred in Mount
Druitt, is attractive as a place of residence to people
who are of Egyptian or
Sudanese background and particularly members of the Coptic Church.  Dr Hanna,
Mr Hanna and the defendant,
Dr Rezk, are people who are in the former
category.
<P>

5	Dr Hanna recruited Dr Rezk when the latter had just finished her training.
Dr Hanna said that she asked Dr Rezk whether she would
be interested in coming
to work for the plaintiff's medical centre.  She says that she told Dr Rezk:
<P>

"Your income will be in accordance with the number of patients you see.  You
will be paid 45 percent of your gross income every
two weeks.  The Centre takes
the other 55 percent and in return it provides you with all of your facilities,
such as advertising,
paperwork, administration, staff, medical equipment,
disposables, etc."
<P>

6	Dr Rezk said she was happy with that arrangement and after clarifying some
details as to initial remuneration Dr Rezk said that
she would like to work in
the medical centre, that she would be staying in the area and did not intend to
open up on her own; she
went to the local church, and her whole family lived in
the area.  Dr Hanna said she then replied:
<P>

"If you ever want to leave the centre you will have to give us 4 weeks' notice,
and of course you will not be able to open your
own practice within a radius of
3 kilometres for a year".
<P>

Dr Rezk simply replied "Yes".
<P>

7	 Mr Hanna says that he introduced himself to Dr Rezk shortly after she
commenced work at the centre.  Mr Hanna is what might be
described as the chief
executive officer of the  plaintiff, who performs or supervises the necessary
administrative work to keep
the centre working smoothly.  He says that shortly
after the defendant commenced he said to her:
<P>

"Doctor , I am pleased that you will be with us for a long time.  I do however
want to make it clear that if you want to leave at
this stage you will not be
able to set up practice within a radius of 3 kilometres of the medical centre
for a period of 1 year.
 You needn't worry about this, as you state that  you
will be here with us for a long time, but I want to make this clear.  You live
close and I want to make sure that you have no intention of opening up your own
surgery in the area."
<P>

8	He says that the defendant replied:
<P>

"I have no intention of opening.  I am not into business.  I am just happy to
come and work here."
<P>

9	The defendant commenced working six days a week at the plaintiff's centre in
September 1996 and continued there until 8 November
1998.
<P>

10	The defendant's husband is a dentist and from 9 November 1998 the defendant
and her husband opened a clinic at Luxford Court,
Mount Druitt, which would
appear to be approximately 1.2 kilometres from the plaintiff's medical centre.
The lease of the clinic
in which the defendant and her husband now practise is
in the name of a company, Medical Dental Pty Ltd, of which it would appear
they
are both directors.
<P>

11	I should infer from the evidence that the defendant practises from the
Luxford Court premises, but whether on her own behalf
or as an employee of a
company, or otherwise, is something that I will have to return to later.
<P>

12	The plaintiff asks for an injunction or, alternatively, damages to prevent
the defendant from setting up a practice within the
three kilometre exclusion
zone up to 8 November 1999.
<P>

13	The primary defence of the defendant is to deny that there was any agreement
as to a three kilometre exclusion zone, but if that
be found against her then
she has various subsidiary defences as to why that exclusion should not be
enforced against her.
<P>

14	The defendant says that there was no mention of any restriction until
November 1998, when she told Mr Hanna that she and her
husband were setting up
rooms at Luxford Court. She says that there was then a conversation in which Mr
Hanna said to her, "You can't
operate so close to us."  She said, "What is too
close?" to which Mr Hanna replied:
<P>

"I'm not sure.  It is about 3 or 5 kilometres.  That's the business law."
<P>

15	The defendant said,  "You never mentioned this to me before" to which Mr
Hanna replied, "No I didn't.  But that's the business
law."
<P>

16	There is some corroboration of the defendant's evidence from the evidence of
her husband.
<P>

17	However, the witnesses on the plaintiff's side say that there was indeed
mention of a restriction of three kilometres and one
year over a considerable
period of time.  Apart from Dr and Mr Hanna there was some evidence from a
nurse, Ms Drew, and another doctor
who worked at the centre Dr Naeem  Hanna.
The latter said that when he came to work at the centre in 1994 he was told
that it was
a condition of all doctors working at the centre that should a
doctor decide to leave the centre he or she would not be allowed to
work as a
doctor on their own in competition with the plaintiff's medical centre within a
radius of three kilometres for one year
after termination.
<P>

18	In both the affidavits of Dr Hanna and Mr Hanna the alleged restriction is
set out in virtually identical words. I have set out
the words earlier, that
is, that the doctor leaving the centre is not able to set up a practice within
three kilometres for one year.
<P>

19	In the evidence before the court, however, that formula was not always
followed.  If one looks at the cross-examination of Mr
Hanna he claims he said
to the defendant ( p 4 of the transcript):
<P>

"If she was ever to leave us she cannot practice within three kilometres for a
year."
<P>

	Though later on the same page he was asked:
<P>

"I want to put to you that you never said to Dr Rezk that if she were to leave
at that stage she would not be able to set up a practice
within a radius of
three kilometres ..."
<P>

 To which Mr Hanna said, "Not true".  
<P>

20	Counsel then asked Mr Hanna whether he kept a record of that discussion
where he said  "She could not operate for a period of
a year within a three
kilometre radius"  to which he simply said "No".
<P>

21	At page 9 he was asked whether the restriction applied no matter who
terminated the agreement and he said:
<P>

"It applies if the doctor, after working leaves the centre, they cannot open
within three kilometres or for a year... restricts
that doctor from setting up
his or her own practice for three kilometres for a period of a year ...  it
means that they cannot set
up a practice or open a surgery within three
kilometre radius for a period of one year, just like it said.  It is plain
English,
really.  I can't simplify it more than that.  Simple as can be".
<P>

22	In cross-examination Dr Hanna said at p 17 of the transcript that the actual
words that she used to Dr Rezk were:
<P>

"When you decide to leave us I need that you give me four weeks' notice and not
to start your practice within a three kilometre
radius for a period of one
year."
<P>

23	She said that most of the doctors entered into such a restriction, though
she later amended that to all the doctors.  She said
that three kilometres was
chosen because most of the patients that attended the centre live around the
area and that they do not
see very many people from further away.
<P>

24	When the plaintiff asked a person, who is supposedly an expert accountant,
to give evidence as to damages, its controllers or
its solicitors must have
given the accountant a history.  The accountant, Mr Hawthorne, at para 9 of his
affidavit, said that he
was instructed that:
<P>

"Dr Rezk's employment contract prohibited her from practising as a doctor
within a 3 kilometre radius of the Company's medical centre
on termination of
her employment with the Company."
<P>

25	 He was further instructed that the doctor was an employee of the medical
centre.  Someone must have told him that because the
affidavit was filed by the
solicitors for the plaintiff and solicitors do not file affidavits which
contain statements which they
do not intend to stand by.
<P>

26	The next significant matter is that the plaintiff, when it came to
understand that the defendant was leaving, instructed solicitors
who trade
under the name of Janus Lawyers.  It would seem that a Mr Assi is the sole
proprietor of that firm.
<P>

27	On 27 October 1998 he wrote to the defendant a letter saying that:
<P>

"In consideration of our client accommodating you in the Mt Druitt Health Care
Medical Centre you agreed to supply your medical
services in the centre.  We
are further instructed that as part of the contract you agreed to not open a
medical practice in competition
with the medical centre."
<P>

28	The letter then went on to indicate that the plaintiff hoped that good
relations could continue, but if they could not the plaintiff
"will take legal
proceedings to prevent you from opening your practice".
<P>

29	This was met by a letter from a firm of solicitors instructed by the
defendant, which is again a rather strange letter.  It acknowledges
that Dr
Rezk commenced employment with the plaintiff (which was probably not true).  It
says that after about eight months E.R. Pty
Ltd commenced supply of medical
services and that neither party ever discussed the question of a restraint, but
recently Mr Hanna
had requested Dr Rezk to enter into a deed of restraint,
which she naturally refused to do.  That statement again is not borne out
by
any of the evidence, and it is rather hard to see how those solicitors got that
impression, unless a fairly confused outline had
been given to them on behalf
of the defendant.
<P>

30	The only witness whose evidence I have not heretofore summarised is that of
Ms Drew.  She says that she is a nurse/receptionist
at the plaintiff's centre,
and that she was on duty on a Saturday at the close of business when she
overheard Mr Hanna say to the
defendant that there was a verbal agreement that
she could not open a practice within three kilometres of the medical centre and
that a verbal agreement was as binding as a written agreement.  Again on the
following Monday she heard the defendant say, in connection
with a conversation
about the restriction, "It's got to be on paper for it to be legal" and Mr
Hanna replied "A verbal agreement
is the same as a written agreement".
<P>

31	In her own evidence Dr Rezk mounted quite a considerable attack on Ms Drew;
that she was a false witness and that she in fact
was not on duty on the night
in question.  Mr Jacobs QC, for the plaintiff, cross-examined as to why she had
not mentioned that in
her affidavit.  I arrogantly thought that I knew the
answer to that, and that was that this surprise information was going to be
used as a bombshell in cross-examination.
<P>

32	However, when the cross-examination came, none of these matters were in fact
put to Ms Drew at all and, indeed, the  defendant's
counsel, Mr Moses, in his
submissions took the view that it did not really matter whether Ms Drew's
evidence was accepted or not.
 That is true to an extent, but the fact that Dr
Rezk went out to attack Ms Drew, saying that she could prove that the evidence
was
false, and then did not, as Mr Jacobs QC submits, throws doubt on the
credibility of Dr Rezk's evidence.
<P>

33	All the witnesses were cross-examined before me.  I must confess that I had
some doubt as to some of the material that was given
to me.  So far as the
evidence of the defendant and her husband is concerned, I found it very
difficult to accept the evidence that
was given.  The defendant was one of
those witnesses who just kept talking and unfortunately, as often happens, the
more she talked
the more she put her foot in it.  She displayed some of the
indicia of an unreliable witness such as volunteering that something
could not
be right and she could prove it, yet she had capable lawyers and they never
attempted to prove it.  Her evidence was in
direct conflict with Ms Drew.  She
said that Ms Drew was not working the night Ms Drew said she overheard the
conversation, and Dr
Rezk said she could prove it.  There was no attempt to do
so.
<P>

34	Dr Emad Rezk, the defendant's husband, was also most unimpressive.  He spoke
quickly and repeated over and over again the same
things, often not responding
to the question, and if his evidence were accepted a very illogical position
would emerge.
<P>

35	However, as I pointed out to Mr Jacobs QC during addresses, the mere fact
that I do not place much reliance on the defendant's
evidence does not
necessarily mean that his client succeeds.  The fact that there was reliance by
the defendant in her evidence and
in the evidence of her husband (which I have
not accepted) that there was no mention of the restriction until after the
announcement
that the defendant was leaving, and that the plaintiff had said
that the restriction was a matter of business law rather than an
agreement,
does make it easier for me to find that the plaintiff's case was correct.
Otherwise the plaintiff's case must stand or
fall on its own strength.
<P>

36	I must confess that I did not find anything to criticise in the evidence of
Dr Hanna.  I was not completely convinced of the
reliability of Mr Hanna
because it did seem, with respect, that he did not quite understand what he was
talking about and that that
was part of the reason for slightly different
versions being given on various occasions.
<P>

37	Dr Naeem Hanna was rather unimpressive but, on the other hand, his evidence
was not too important, though his version of the
covenant is significant.  I
think that I must accept Ms Drew's evidence, but having rejected the
defendant's version it does not
matter very much.
<P>

38	There is no doubt at all in this case that there was some sort of contract,
at least initially, between the plaintiff and the
defendant.  The contract was
that the plaintiff would supply all the necessities for a medical practice,
including the patients;
that the doctor would bill, usually Medicare; the
plaintiff would collect the moneys that flowed in from Medicare and account for
45 percent to the defendant and 55 percent to itself.
<P>

39	 There are also other terms of the contract that must  have been applicable.
Unfortunately, this is an oral contract where the
focus has been on a
particular clause as to a restraint of trade the details of which are very
sketchily filled out.  The evidence
of Mr Hanna was that the oral agreements
with the various doctors reflect their services, their hours, their
remuneration, leave
and notice, but just how far these were binding contractual
terms, and how far they were understandings, is left a bit nebulous.
<P>

40	Although I am summarising rather than quoting, Mr Moses puts that there were
a number of factors which make it unlikely that
the term which is mentioned in
the amended summons was a term of the oral agreement.
<P>

41	1.  	As Dr Rezk herself said, she lived in the area and would not likely
have agreed to a restriction that would have stopped
her practising in her own
town, especially when she was only to get 45 percent of her gross earnings;
<P>

2.  	The plaintiff did not specifically refer to the alleged agreement in early
letters of demand by its solicitors;
<P>

3.  	The plaintiff's witnesses have given different versions of the
restriction;
<P>

4.  	Mr Hanna first suggested that the restriction was a matter of business law
rather than a matter of agreement (which I have
rejected);
<P>

5.  	Dr Naeem Hanna's version of the "standard covenant" was different to that
pleaded, ie not to work as a doctor;
<P>

6.  	The version that was given to Mr Hawthorne was different;
<P>

7.  	Ms Drew does not mention a one year restriction;  and
<P>

8.  	The various versions of the so-called covenant were such that there could
not be more than a vague general understanding.
<P>

42	Apart from these matters, there is the problem that the contract on behalf
of the plaintiff appears to have been made by Dr Hanna
with the defendant.  The
conversation with Mr Hanna, set out in paragraphs 27 and following of affidavit
PA01, was after the defendant
had started work.  That conversation,
accordingly, could not have had contractual effect, unless it was to settle an
ambiguity that
might have been inherent in the contract that had been made
earlier by the plaintiff through Dr Hanna.
<P>

43	The conversation with Dr Hanna, as will be remembered, was:
<P>

"Of course, you will not be able to open your own practice within a radius of 3
kilometres for a year".
<P>

44	Those words are not the words of promise, but rather that there is a general
understanding.  However, when the doctor gave evidence
at page 17 of the
transcript, as I have already indicated, the words "of course" are not there,
so that one must be a little careful
about being too precious about verbal
formulae.
<P>

45	On the other hand, Mr Jacobs QC puts that the surrounding circumstances
favour the inference that the restriction was a term
of the contract.  He
points to various factors and again I summarise rather than quote.
<P>

46	First, the fact that the defendant said that she was not bound because there
was nothing in writing, rather than that there was
no agreement at all, tends
to suggest that there  was in fact some oral agreement.
<P>

47	Secondly, the evidence suggests that all the doctors (or perhaps almost all
the doctors) entered into a similar restriction.
<P>

48	Thirdly, the restriction is the sort of restriction that one would expect in
the situation where the plaintiff was at risk in
handing on a plate to a young
doctor all the capital facilities necessary for her to establish a practice,
where there was no other
protection; and
<P>

49	Fourthly, the lies that were told by the defendant and her husband should
reinforce the remaining material to show that there
was in fact such an
agreement.
<P>

50	I have found this a very difficult matter to decide. The plaintiff bears the
onus of proof and the plaintiff must make it clear
on the balance of
probabilities that there was a definite agreement in the terms set out in the
prayers in the amended summons, or
something close to that effect.
<P>

51	I feel confident on the evidence that there was mention between 1996 and
1998 of not being involved in the medical profession
within three kilometres of
the centre when a doctor left the centre.  However, the differing versions that
I have been given of the
covenant, particularly the versions given by the
controllers of the plaintiff to its accountant, and in the early affidavits,
give
me the impression, to use Mr Moses' expression, of "historical
revisionism".
<P>

52	It seems to me that whilst there was from time to time mention that doctors
who left were not to be involved within three kilometres
of the centre, the
exact terms of the restriction were never spelt out, let alone spelt out when
the contract was initially made.
 It was a matter of "of course you will not
operate within three kilometres".
<P>

53	Although these doctors do not appear to have had any legal advice, it is
quite clear to anyone considering a covenant of this
nature that it has to be
put in fairly precise language because one must cover not only the question as
to whether the covenant is
a brass plate covenant, or a covenant against
activity, but also whether the restriction is to cover not only present
activity by
the doctor, but also activity by any partnership or company or
other entity with which she might be involved.
<P>

54	I am not able to find, on the balance of probabilities, that there ever was
a sufficiently certain covenant that bound the defendant
containing the
restriction pleaded in the amended summons.
<P>

55	However, even if the plaintiff overcame this hurdle, there are other
problems which would probably mean that it would not succeed.
<P>

56	It is common ground that between eight months and a year after the defendant
commenced working, she said to the controllers of
the plaintiff that her
accountant had advised her that she should operate through a company E.R. Pty
Ltd and asked that her remuneration
be paid to E. R. Pty Ltd. This in fact
happened.
<P>

57	Mr Moses puts that this had one of two consequences.   First, the defendant
must have terminated her "employment" at least a
year ago, so that the time of
the restriction is now spent.  Alternatively, there has been a novation of the
contract, so that the
restriction now covers E. R. Pty Ltd and E. R. Pty Ltd is
not a party to these proceedings.  It  seems to me that, although technical,
there is a lot of strength in those particular submissions.
<P>

58	Mr Jacobs QC says that that is not so, that the defendant has to establish
novation, which she has not done.  Also there is no
intention shown between the
parties that the change in contracting parties had the effect of discharging
the personal obligation
of Dr Rezk not to compete after she left the
practice.
<P>

59	I think on balance what Mr Jacobs QC said is correct, but one of the
problems is that when we have verbal contracts and novation
of verbal
contracts, and generally things are left vague, it is very, very difficult
indeed for a court, when it is called upon to
enforce them, to really know what
the parties meant.  Generally speaking, if parties mean to enforce contracts
they must have them
prepared with sufficient certainty.
<P>

60	However, even if there was a continuous obligation on Dr Rezk not to open a
practice within three kilometres, the evidence really
does not show that she
has done so.  There is no doubt at all that she has her name on the door of a
practice 1.2 kilometres down
the road, but the only evidence is that that
practice is carried on in premises leased by Medical Dental Pty Ltd, and we do
not know
what the status is of Dr Rezk in that practice.
<P>

61	Although the evidence does not get to this degree of precision, the orders
sought in the amended summons are that the defendant
should not set up her own
practice as a medical practitioner, or that she should cease practising in
Luxford Court "which she has
established in her own name as a sole
practitioner".  It seems, accordingly, that the breach complained of is that
the defendant
has established a medical practice in her sole name.  The
evidence is not sufficient to find that.
<P>

62	The next matter is whether if there was a contractual restraint it is valid.
Normally restraints of trade are invalid unless
they are reasonable and whether
or not a restraint is reasonable needs to be judged in connection with the
relationship between the
parties.  Usually such a covenant is only valid
between an employer and employee, between partners or between vendor and
purchaser.
<P>

63	However, the Queensland Court of Appeal in<b> Whillans v Ashcoast Pty
Ltd</b> 6 March 1998, unreported, treated an arrangement between a doctor and a
company, which operated a medical centre in the western suburbs
of the Gold
Coast and provided services to that doctor, as a contract analogous to that of
a partnership under which the medical
centre company had goodwill.  That
company was entitled to protect that goodwill by a covenant that was in fact
wider than the covenant
in the present case.
<P>

64	Mr Moses put that the present case is distinguishable from<b> Whillans'</b>
<b>case</b>.  There are always differences between two sets of cases, but I do
not consider the differences are sufficiently wide for me not
to follow it.
<P>

65	Mr Jacobs QC urges me to follow that decision and as the decision is that of
a Full Court of one of the Australian States I do
so.
<P>

66	Accordingly, had the covenant been proved I would have held it was valid and
there appears to be no valid reason to say that
a three kilometre and one year
restriction is too  wide.  Indeed the material suggests that it is not too wide
:  (a) because that
is what the parties agreed and normally they are the best
judge;  and (b) Dr Hanna's evidence, which I accept, that the patient drawing
area of the practice is predominantly local.  When one looks at the map, three
kilometres from Mount Druitt roughly takes in St Marys
on the west, Rooty Hill
on the east and what are popularly called the new housing areas on the north,
so that three kilometres would
appear to be a fair enough restriction.
<P>

67	The next matter is whether, had I found there to be a valid restriction, I
would have granted an injunction.  There is, of course,
the well-known passage
in the judgment of the House of Lords in<b> Doherty v Allman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281878%29%203%20AC%20709" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1878) 3 AC
709</a>, 720 that:
<P>

"If parties, for valuable consideration, with their eyes open, contract that a
particular thing shall not be done, all that a Court
of Equity has to do is to
say, by way of injunction, that which the parties have already said by way of
covenant, that the thing
shall not be done; and in such a case the injunction
does nothing more than give the sanction of the process of the Court to that
which is already the contract between the parties.  It is not then a question
of the balance of convenience or inconvenience, or
of the amount of damages or
of injury - it is the specific performance, by the Court, of that negative
bargain which the parties
have made, with their eyes open, between
themselves."
<P>

68	Mr Jacobs QC also says that that learning is reinforced by the fact that
proving damages in this sort of case is a difficult
matter and that parties are
encouraged to make a commercial contract between themselves, which will avoid
the necessity of having
to prove damages by complex accountants' evidence, and
to rely on the promises made.
<P>

69	As against that it could be said that the public is entitled to have the
doctor of its choice available and that when one realises
that, even if the
covenant was enforceable, the doctor could practice only 3.1 kilometres away
from the centre of Mount Druitt and
might even be able to provide her own
transport for patients, advertise and do house calls within the restricted
area, the damages
must be extremely small.
<P>

70	I consider that the probabilities would be that there is sufficient doubt
about the assessment of damages in this case for it
to be a case which, had the
plaintiff succeeded, an injunction would go rather than the plaintiff be left
to damages.
<P>

71	However, as things have turned out, the plaintiff is not entitled to relief
and accordingly the proceedings should be dismissed.
<P>

72	My present feeling is that there should be no order as to costs for reasons
which I have given informally.  However, I have not
yet come to a final
determination on that matter. 
<P>

73	Through no fault of his own, Mr Moses is not able to be here this afternoon.
If I have not heard that the defendant wishes to
argue the question of costs
within seven days of my Associate certifying a copy of this judgment, I will
dismiss the proceedings
with no order as to costs.  If I do get such an
indication within that period of seven days then the matter can be listed
before
me on a Tuesday or Thursday at 9.30 am.
<P>

  
<P>

 
<P>

                                         oOo
