<b><u>70002/97  -  REGINA  v  MICHAEL PATSALIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70200/97  -  REGINA  v  ALEXIOS SPATHIS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (On Application for Separate Trials) - [No 1]</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The Crown has foreshadowed an indictment in
the following terms:
<P>

"On 10June 1999, the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of Her Majesty
CHARGES THAT
<P>

<center>Michael PATSALIS</center>
<P>


<P>

<center>and</center>
<P>


<P>

<center>Alexios SPATHIS</center>
<P>


<P>

On 11 April 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did murder Klaus
Peter LUDWIG."
<P>

2  	Particulars have been furnished to the representatives of each
accused.  In the case of Mr Patsalis, the Crown has alleged that
it will rely
upon the following:
<P>

"1.	Either Mr Patsalis was a principal in the first degree (with the requisite
intent) and stabbed the deceased;  or
<P>

2.	That both Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis were both principals in the first
degree (with the requisite intent) and they both stabbed
the deceased;  or
<P>

3.	That Mr Patsalis was acting in concert with Spathis and Spathis stabbed the
deceased (with the requisite intent);  or
<P>

4.	That they both are guilty of murder on the basis of the felony murder rule,
namely that they went together with a specific intent
to rob the deceased and
`at the time of, or immediately after, such robbery ... wound[ed]' the deceased
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s98.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 98</a>, <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</i> 1900</a> NSW)."
<P>

3  	The letter in respect of Mr Spathis is the same, except that
paragraphs 1 and 3 which are in these terms:
<P>

"1.	Either Mr Spathis was a principal in the first degree (with the requisite
intent) and stabbed the deceased;  ...
<P>

3.	That Mr Spathis was acting in concert with Patsalis and Patsalis stabbed the
deceased (with the requisite intent); ..."
<P>

4  	Application is made under s 365(2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> on
behalf of Mr Patsalis for a separate trial.  The application is opposed by the
Crown.  It is also opposed by Mr Spathis.  Whereas
Mr Patsalis asserts that a
joint trial would bring about a positive injustice to him, Mr Spathis contends
that "severance may operate
so as to deprive (him) of a fair trial".
<P>

5  	Both accused provided lengthy interviews to the police.  Each
acknowledged his presence at the time of Mr Ludwig's stabbing.
 The three were
in a truck parked by the side of the road at Botany.  Mr Ludwig occupied the
centre seat.  The accused were on either
side.  Mr Patsalis asserted that Mr
Spathis occupied, at the relevant time, the driver's seat, and that Mr Spathis
stabbed the deceased.
 Mr Spathis acknowledged that he had originally been in
the driver's seat.  However, immediately before the stabbing he and Mr Patsalis
swapped sides.  Mr Patsalis thereafter, according to Mr Spathis, stabbed the
deceased.
<P>

<b>Relevance Principles</b>
<P>

6  	There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule.  It is desirable, in
the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned
with the one
crime should be dealt with in the one trial.  That rule is subject to the
proviso that, if a joint trial would cause
positive injustice to an accused,
then a separate trial should be ordered (<b><i>R v Oliver </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2057%20ALR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 57 ALR
543).</a>
<P>

7  	Elaborating upon that test, Hunt J made the following comment in
<b><i>R v Middis </i></b>(unreported, 27 March 1991):  (at 5)
<P>

"I do not believe that the Court of Criminal Appeal in <u>Regina v Oliver</u>
intended an applicant for a separate trial to demonstrate that positive
injustice would more likely than not be caused by a joint
trial (as it was
suggested in argument);  nor do I accept that a mere possibility of prejudice
is sufficient (as it was also suggested
in argument).  In my view, what the
court of Criminal Appeal was saying was that, as some prejudice to one or other
accused is inevitable
in any joint trial, it must be shown by an applicant for
a separate trial that the particular prejudice upon which reliance is placed
by
him would - <u>if</u> it arises - result in positive injustice to him in a
joint trial."
<P>

8  	The issue of prejudice must be examined from the viewpoint of the
accused (<b><i>de Jesus v R</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2068%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 68 ALR 1.</a>  Is the reception of
evidence at the trial admissible against Mr Spathis, but inadmissible against
Mr Patsalis, such as to endanger
the prospect of a fair trial for Mr
Patsalis?
<P>

9  	There is to some degree, although a minor degree, a question of
balancing prejudice with convenience.  In <b><i>R v Oliver</i></b>, the Court
said the Judge must take account of the following:  (at 547)
<P>

"...the public interest in the efficient despatch of trials, the conserving of
costs and the avoidance of any inconvenience to witnesses
by having to attend a
number of trials."
<P>

10  	Hunt J, in <b><i>Middis</i></b>, explained the balance which
should be struck in these terms:
<P>

"That is not to suggest, however, that the prejudice caused to an accused is
easily outweighed."
<P>

11  	(cf <b><i>R v Demirok</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1976/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] VicRp 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20VR%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) VR 244</a> at 254).
<P>

12  	In <b><i>Middis</i></b>, Hunt J identified the circumstances in
which it would be appropriate to order a separate trial.  He said this:  (at
4)
<P>

"Briefly, the relevant principles are that:
<P>

1.	where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is
significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against
another or
the other accused to be jointly tried with him, <u>and</u>
<P>

2.	where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly
prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible
against him, <u>and</u>
<P>

3.	where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant
will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the
prejudicial material,
<P>

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the
applicant.  The applicant must show that positive
injustice would be caused to
him in a joint trial."
<P>

13  	The applicant submitted that this passage overstates the
requirements.  Nothing said by the High Court justifies the accumulation
of
each of the three requirements identified by Hunt J before a separate trial is
ordered.  The test, as formulated by Hunt J in
<b><i>Middis</i></b>, has,
however, been repeatedly accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal (<b><i>R v
Baartman</i></b> (unreported, 6 October 1994);  <b><i>R v Fernando</i></b>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCCA 66</a>, para 199-122;  <b><i>R v Georgiou</i></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/125.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCCA 125).</a>
I accept, nonetheless, that the formulation by Hunt J in <b><i>Middis
</i></b>does not state exhaustively the circumstances in which a Court should
order a separate trial.  The touchstone must, of necessity,
remain general.  Is
there a risk of positive injustice to the accused were he or she to stand trial
jointly with a co-accused?
<P>

<b>Cut-Throat Defences</b>
<P>

14  	Messrs Patsalis and Spathis, in their description of the events
of 11 April 1996, each described a number of separate phases:
<P>

&#183;	First, there was what might be termed a preparation phase.  Arrangements
were made to meet the deceased at Bankstown.  A
number of purchases were made
beforehand (two pairs of gloves, two knives, a tarpaulin and one tin of
petrol).
<P>

&#183;	Second, having met the deceased, two vehicles were then driven from
Bankstown to the Marrickville RSL.  Mr Spathis was in
his car.  Mr Patsalis was
a passenger in the truck driven by Mr Ludwig.
<P>

&#183;	Third, once at Marrickville, Mr Spathis parked his car.  He then entered
the truck, sitting alongside Mr Ludwig, with Mr
Patsalis on the other side,
nearest the door.  Mr Spathis then drove to Botany.
<P>

&#183;	Fourth, at some point the vehicle parked by the side of the road at
Botany.  Whilst parked, Mr Ludwig was stabbed.  Each
accused blames the other.
Each asserts ignorance of the sinister purpose of the other.  Both acknowledge
that money was removed from
Mr Ludwig's jacket after the stabbing.
<P>

&#183;	Fifth, Mr Spathis then drove back to Marrickville with Mr Patsalis as a
passenger.  Mr Patsalis then alighted.  He thereafter
drove Mr Spathis'
vehicle.  Mr Patsalis was covered with blood.  The car seat was protected by
the plastic tarpaulin purchased earlier
in the day.
<P>

&#183;	Sixth, the two vehicles then drove to Terry Hills, although by a
circuitous route.  At Terry Hills the body was removed from
the cabin by Mr
Spathis, and left by the side of the road.  It was doused in petrol.  Further
money was removed from the jacket of
the deceased.  The body was then set
alight.
<P>

&#183;	Seventh, the vehicles then left the scene, although in circumstances
which were somewhat chaotic.  The burning of the body,
and the rapid exit from
the area, were witnessed by the occupants of a number of vehicles which were in
the area.
<P>

&#183;	Eighth, the vehicles proceeded to Mr Patsalis' flat at Homebush.  Mr
Spathis was driving the truck, and Mr Patsalis Mr Spathis'
car.  Having met at
Homebush, the two vehicles were then driven to Chester Hill where the truck was
set alight.  Mr Patsalis placed
his blood stained clothes inside the truck, so
that they were also destroyed.
<P>

15  	The description of these matters is common to both interviews.
The difference between the two accounts is in the role each
accused assigns to
himself, and his co-accused.  Each seeks to explain his complicity, upon the
basis of ignorance of the true purpose
of the other before the deceased was
stabbed, and threats made by the other after the stabbing had taken place.  The
matter, therefore,
involves what are termed "cut-throat defences".  In <b><i>R
v Ignjatic</i></b> (CCA, unreported, 6 July 1993) Hunt J made the following
comment:  (at 10)
<P>

"It may be said that, since the decisions in <b>Guimond</b> and <b>Darby</b>,
the mere existence of cut-throat defences is no longer a basis for
<i>supporting</i> a joint trial:  cf <b>Regina v Kerekes</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2070%20WN%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 70 WN 102</a>
at 103, 105, 106;  <b>Regina v Beaven</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%2069%20WN%20140" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 69 WN 140</a> at 142.  I discussed
this point in <b>Regina v Farrell &amp; Cotton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2048%20A%20Crim%20R%20311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 48 A Crim R 311</a> at
313-314, and I will not repeat what I said there.  But that does not mean that
the mere existence of cut-throat defences has become
a basis for
<i>rejecting</i> a joint trial.  Obviously, there will be cases in which
cut-throat defences are raised where it may be appropriate to order separate
trials, <u>but they would not in my view arise frequently</u>.  In a proper
summing-up, the jury will be directed separately in relation to the evidence
admissible against each accused:  <b>Regina v Masters</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 450</a>
at 455.  The undoubted prejudice created by such an unsworn statement by a
co-accused in a joint trial is usually considerably lessened
in such a
circumstance, and thus it would not amount to the positive injustice required
to warrant separate trials."  (emphasis added)
<P>

16  	In <b><i>Webb and Hay v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%2d94%5d%20181%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993-94] 181 CLR 41</a>,
Michael Webb and Veronica Hay were charged with murder.  Ms Hay sought a
separate trial.  Toohey J described the basis for her application
in these
words:  (at 88)
<P>

"The justification, indeed the alleged necessity, for separate trials lies in
the fact that in three records of interview with Webb,
which could be expected
to be and were adduced in evidence by the prosecution, Webb made assertions
that Hay had engaged in a violent
and sadistic attack on the deceased.  And, it
was said, although the trial judge warned the jury that this evidence was not
admissible
against Hay, such a direction could not cure the overwhelming
prejudice inevitably caused to Hay."
<P>

17  	His Honour then stated the principles in these words (with which
Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed):  (at 88/89)
<P>

"King CJ dealt with this ground by pointing out that there are `strong reasons
of principle and policy why persons charged with
committing an offence jointly
ought to be tried together.  That is particularly so where each seeks to cast
the blame on the other'
(<i>R v Webb &amp; Hay </i>(1992) 59 SASR at 585).
What King CJ referred to as `strong reasons of principle and policy' were
discussed by his Honour in <i>Reg v Collie</i> ((1991) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1991/3461.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] SASC 2996</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20SASR%20302" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">56 SASR 302</a> at 307-311).
I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasizes that when accused
are charged with committing a crime jointly,
prima facie there should be a
joint trial.  There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but,
more importantly, consideration
by the same jury at the same trial is likely to
avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the
blame
on the other or others (<i>Reg v Demirok </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1976/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] VicRp 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20VR%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] VR 244</a> at 254).
There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the
admission of evidence which would not be admitted
at the trial of one accused.
That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the use they
may make of the evidence
so far as it concerns each accused (<i>Reg v
Harbach</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%206%20SASR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 6 SASR 427</a> at 433)."
<P>

18  	Commenting upon the application of these principles (although
applying the test relevant to appellate review), Toohey J said
this:  (at
89)
<P>

"In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge.  It is
true that Webb did not give evidence and was therefore
not subject to
cross-examination, though the jury heard his statements to the police
implicating Hay.  But, as King CJ observed ((1992)
59 SASR at 585):  `That is a
common feature of a joint trial and does not of itself render separate trials
necessary.'  Properly
instructed by the trial judge, as they were, the jury
were capable of appreciating the use they could make of evidence as against
each of the appellants.  It has not been shown that a substantial miscarriage
of justice is likely to have occurred."
<P>

19  	The Court of Criminal Appeal in <b><i>R v Fernando &amp;
Anor</i></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCCA 66</a> considered the same issue.  The trial Judge had
refused to order separate trials.  The two accused were charged with aggravated
sexual
assault and murder.  The Court (Newman, Studdert and James JJ)
identified the issue which gave rise to the application for separate
trials in
these words:  (at 106, para 220)
<P>

"The tenor of Brendan Fernando's statements to the police was that while he was
present during most of the events which occurred
he was subject to the control
of Vester Fernando who was armed with a machete.  Indeed, he stated to the
police at the time when
the victim was killed he was not present, having left
the company of Vester Fernando and the victim shortly before the lethal event
must have occurred.  Thus while his statements may not be considered as being a
complete `cut throat' defence they are certainly
exculpatory to a degree of his
own participation and thoroughly implicate Vester Fernando."
<P>

20  	At the trial, Brendan Fernando did not give evidence.  Thus his
statements were not capable of being tested by either the Crown
prosecutor or
Vester Fernando's counsel.  Nonetheless, the Court said this:  (at 106, para
222)
<P>

"However, his recorded admissions do, in the court's view, fall within the type
of evidence adverted to in the authorities and particularly
by Toohey J in
<b>Webb and Hay</b> which support the contention that there ought to have been
a joint trial."
<P>

<b>The Opposition of Mr Spathis</b>
<P>

21  	Mr Spathis, as mentioned, opposes the application for
separation.  Indeed, he asserts that injustice to him is likely unless
the
matter proceeds as a joint trial.  Were it otherwise, the jury would hear but
half of the story.
<P>

22  	Such a submission finds support in many authorities.  They are
conveniently collected in <b><i>R v Fernando</i></b>.  In <b><i>R v
Grondkowski</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1946%5d%201%20KB%20369" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1946] 1 KB 369</a>, the Court of Criminal Appeal cited with
approval the following passage from <b><i>R v Gibbon &amp; Proctor</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2013%20Cr%20App%20R%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 13 Cr App R 134:</a>
<P>

"It is not enough to say that counsel could have defended them more easily if
they had been tried separately ... there may have
been many things made clear
to the jury which would not have been made clear if the prosecution had been
embarrassed by having to
deal with the two cases separately.  The whole story
was before the jury of what went on in the house where the two appellants lived
together."
<P>

23  	The Court of Criminal Appeal in <b><i>Fernando</i></b> made the
following comment upon these authorities:  (at 100, para 203)
<P>

"<b>Grondkowski </b>was a case involving cut-throat defences.  As we apprehend
the passage cited and other passages from the judgment it was considered
that
cases of that kind are better heard together.  The reason for that is the
opportunity given to the jury to observe each of the
accused and to consider
the whole of the relevant facts rather than what may be a misleading portion of
them."
<P>

24  	The Court also drew attention to the following passage from
<b><i>Grondkowski</i></b> which it quoted with approval:  (at 100, para 203)
<P>

"Prima facie it appears to the court that where the essence of the case is that
the prisoners were engaged on a common enterprise
that it is obviously right
and proper that they should be jointly indicated and jointly tried and in some
cases it would be as much
in the interests of the accused as of the prosecution
that they should be."
<P>

25  	<b><i>Grondkowski</i></b>, as the Court of Criminal Appeal
remarked, has been consistently followed in this State, including <b><i>R v
Kerekes </i></b>(1973) WN;  <b><i>R v Flaherty &amp; Ors</i></b> (1968) 3 NSWLR
and <b><i>R v Merrett</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=19%20A%20Crim%20R%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">19 A Crim R 363.</a>
<P>

26  	The Court specifically drew attention to the remarks of Herron J
in <b><i>R v Beavan</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=69%20WN%20141" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">69 WN 141</a> at 142/143, where his Honour said
this:
<P>

"If separate trials were had, very often only one half of the picture could be
presented to the jury.  In order to do complete justice,
juries are entitled to
see and hear all those who are alleged to have acted in common purpose, and it
is neither a rule of law nor
of practice that where an essential part of one
accused's defence amounts to an attack on a co-accused there must be separate
trials.
 Cases have occurred and will no doubt continue to occur, in which one
accused says that he or she was persuaded by the superior
intellect of the
other accused to take some part in the enterprise, or that he or she was
intimidated by the relationship or threats
of that other.  It is essential to
the proper appreciation of such cases that the jury should see and hear all
parties.  It is true
that statements not on oath can be prejudicial to the one
referred to in them, but as they are not statements on oath the jury can
be
warned by the trial judge to reject those references to the co-accused, and
there is no reason to think that a commonsense jury
will refuse to follow such
advice."
<P>

27  	These remarks have not met with universal acclaim.  Hunt J in
<b><i>R v Farrell &amp; Cotton</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2048%20A%20Crim%20R%20311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 48 A Crim R 311</a>, suggested that
they involve a fallacy.  The suggestion that a jury may complete the picture by
resorting to the account provided
by a co-accused demonstrates the very problem
inherent in a joint trial.  The two cases must be considered separately.  It is
impermissible,
therefore, to supplement the picture emerging in one by resort
to the picture provided by the other.  Hunt J said this, referring
to the
remarks of Herron J in <b><i>R v Beavan</i></b>:  (at 313)
<P>

"In my view, those statements are no longer binding upon me in the light of the
decisions in <i>Darby</i> and <i>Guldur</i>, although they must of course be
accorded the respect which is due to any views expressed by that very
experienced trial judge. 
Notwithstanding that respect which is due, however, I
suggest that there is a fallacy in the notion that `juries are entitled to
see
and hear all those who are alleged to have acted in common purpose'."
<P>

28  	His Honour added:  (at 314)
<P>

"In effect, the jury is told that, when considering the case against one
accused, they must disregard completely all of the evidence
admissible only
against the other accused - that in effect they should have regard only to the
half picture which is admissible against
that particular accused.  If it became
necessary, the jury would be told to disregard completely even the appearance
of the other
accused.  If, for example, one accused in such a trial alleged
duress by the other accused, the build and the demeanour of that other
accused
while he made his unsworn statement and generally during the trial would not be
admissible for or against the accused making
that claim:  cf <i>Kelly</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1946/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] NSWStRp 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2046%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20344" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 46 SR (NSW) 344</a> at 349, 357.
<P>

I would therefore, with the greatest of respect to Herron J, disagree that
`complete justice' requires the jury in the usual case
to see and hear all
those who are alleged to have acted in common purpose.  It would be otherwise
where it can be assumed with confidence
that the accused will be giving
evidence..."
<P>

29  	Two comments should be made concerning these statements.  First,
the divide between two cases can be maintained, and yet a
more thorough
understanding provided by having two competing versions.  It is much like the
adversary system.  The juxtaposition
of two competing versions aids a critical
examination of each.  Although one version may not be used to supplement the
other, the
two versions are likely to provoke questions in the jury's mind,
which will assist in the resolution of factual issues.
<P>

30  	Secondly, in New South Wales, since 10 June 1994, the right of
an accused person to make an unsworn statement has been abolished.
Accordingly, the accused in this case must elect to give evidence, or give
none.  There is no middle course.  Neither accused is
able, at this point in
time, to say which course will be adopted.
<P>

31  	Were the accused to give evidence, the "fallacy" to which Hunt J
drew attention would cease to operate.  The recorded interview
would then be
available as evidence in the trial against both accused.
<P>

<b>The Basis of the Application</b>
<P>

32  	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Patsalis that to determine the
application a number of issues should be addressed sequentially:
<P>

&#183;	First, is the ERISP material relating to Mr Spathis admissible (and
therefore likely to be before the jury in any joint trial)?
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, having regard to so much of the ERISP as is admissible, is it
prejudicial to Mr Patsalis?
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, if it is, is there a predictable risk of positive injustice to
Mr Patsalis were the matter to proceed as a joint
trial?  If there is such a
risk, an order should be made for separate trials.
<P>

33  	Dealing with the first matter, it was submitted that much of the
recorded interview concerning Mr Spathis is inadmissible,
either because it is
irrelevant, or because it cannot be regarded as an admission (that is, a
statement adverse to the interests
of Mr Spathis).  Further, parts of the
interview are incoherent.  Its meaning, therefore, is uncertain.  The Crown
should identify
those matters which satisfy the requirements of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act 1995</a>.  Only then can the potential for prejudice to Mr Patsalis be
understood.
<P>

34  	The Crown responded to these submissions in a number of ways.
It asserted that the entire recorded interview was relevant.
 Mr Spathis
describes the sequence of events culminating in the death of Mr Ludwig, and the
steps taken to dispose of the body, and
destroy the truck.  Plainly such
material is directly relevant.  Counsel for Mr Patsalis did not suggest
otherwise.  Further, Mr
Spathis described his relationship with Mr Patsalis.
That relationship is relevant to the allegation made by the Crown of a joint
criminal enterprise, and the scope of that enterprise (<b><i>Wilson v R</i></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20123%20CLR%20334" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 123 CLR 334</a>, per Barwick CJ at 338-340, Menzies J at 343;
<b><i>Harriman v R</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20167%20CLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 167 CLR 590).</a>  No doubt aspects of the
interview are self-serving.  However, in fairness, and in principle, the Crown
is obliged to tender the
entire interview.  The obligation to do so is stated
succinctly in Glissan &amp; Tilmouth, <b>Australian Criminal Trial
Directions</b> 5103, in these words:  (at 4-500-10-15)
<P>

"Where confessional statements are tendered by the prosecution and also contain
assertions of fact favourable to an accused, the
favourable material is
admissible as evidence not merely that the statement was made, but that it is
probative of the truth:  <i>Queen Caroline's Case</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281821%29%201%20St%20Tr%20%28NS%29%20949" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1821) 1 St Tr (NS)
949."</a>
<P>

35  	See also, <b><i>R v Williamson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%202%20NSWLR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 2 NSWLR 281</a> at
289;  Cross on Evidence (5th Aust Ed) p 929 (para 33455).
<P>

36  	On behalf of Mr Spathis it was accepted that that the ERISP
interview was relevant and admissible.  It would not be suggested
that it was
involuntary.  Counsel for Mr Spathis may ultimately seek the exclusion of
certain phrases or answers, or parts of answers,
as a matter of discretion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss
135</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>).  However, it was acknowledged that such matters
were likely to involve no more than minor editing of the interview.
<P>

37  	That being the position of the Crown and Mr Spathis, it is
likely that the ERISP interview concerning Mr Spathis will be admitted.
 The
interview appears to me relevant.  It is also coherent.  The transcription of
direct speech sometimes makes it necessary to
read an entire passage to obtain
the sense of what is being said.
<P>

38  	I will approach my task upon the basis that the entire interview
is admitted (although parts of it may ultimately be excluded,
as a matter of
discretion).  It is not suggested by the Crown that the interview provided by
Mr Spathis would be available as evidence
against Mr Patsalis.  The jury would
be so instructed.  Nonetheless, being a joint trial, and although inadmissible,
it would be
seen by the jury, and the jury would have available (for the
purposes of determining whether Mr Spathis was guilty) a transcription
of the
interview.
<P>

<b>Possible Prejudice Against Mr Patsalis</b>
<P>

39  	Progressing to the second question, what aspects of Mr Spathis'
account are prejudicial to Mr Patsalis?  Counsel for Mr Patsalis
drew attention
to many of the answers provided by Mr Spathis in the course of the interview.
They were said to be prejudicial.  Although
other aspects were referred to in
the course of argument, the written submissions helpfully provided by counsel
for Mr Patsalis identified
the following matters as being of particular
concern:
<P>

"Spathis in his Record of Interview made a number of admissions and made many
more allegations against the Applicant.  These include
that he lent his car to
the Applicant Q19;  that he and his family and girlfriend had been the subject
of threats Q24;  that the
applicant was addicted to gambling;  that he had
loaned the applicant $16000 Q31;  that there was an agreement to repay him at
the
rate of $125 per week Q40;  that they were driving around getting
everything that the Applicant `normally wanted';  he bought some
stuff in a
Target bag;  that he said that he was going to get a container;  that he got a
container and filled it up;  see generally
Q43;  who was seated where in the
car Q47;  they (the Applicant and the deceased) scuffled in the truck Q48, 56;
and see Qs 69-73;
 that the applicant had spoken about guns Q56;  see the
indefinite assertions about a knife Q91-95;  and further to Q112."
<P>

40  	The matters said to be prejudicial can be divided, conveniently,
into the following categories:
<P>

&#183;	First, there are many aspects of the account given by Mr Patsalis which
coincide with the description provided by Mr Spathis.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, there are other matters where they each describe the same
event, differing only in the role which they assign to
each other.  The
stabbing of Mr Ludwig is an example.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, they each assert that, in the course of the evening, they were
threatened by the other.  The threats are the explanation
for their
co-operation with the destruction of evidence, and the disposal of the body
after Mr Ludwig had been stabbed.
<P>

&#183;	Fourthly, Mr Spathis raises a number of matters which are unquestionably
damaging to Mr Patsalis.  Two specific matters are
of particular concern.  Mr
Spathis asserted that Mr Patsalis was a gambler, adding "he's addicted like
someone was to, to drugs"
(Q31, p6).  He also recounted certain discussions
with Mr Patsalis concerning guns.
<P>

41  	Dealing with the first category, no risk of injustice arises in
my view from such matters.  Let me take one illustration. 
Counsel for Mr
Patsalis complained, on behalf of his client, that reference by Mr Spathis to
the $16,000 owed by Mr Patsalis as a
result of a loan was prejudicial (Spathis
interview Q30).  However, Mr Patsalis, in his interview, provided the same
information
(Q24; Q60-64).  There are many other similar illustrations.
<P>

42  	It is convenient to deal with the second and third aspects
together.  The assertion by Mr Spathis that Mr Patsalis stabbed
Mr Ludwig is
obviously prejudicial.  However, the prejudice is significantly diluted, in my
opinion, in circumstances where the jury
will also have before it the interview
provided by Mr Patsalis.  Mr Patsalis, as mentioned, makes allegations against
Mr Spathis
which are the mirror reverse of those made by Mr Spathis against Mr
Patsalis.  The presence of matching allegation, and counter-allegation,
will
serve to remind the jury that no assumption can be made as to where the truth
lies.  The same can be said in respect of the
threats, which each asserts, were
made against the other.
<P>

43  	It is in the nature of cases involving cut-throat defences that
there will be allegation and counter-allegation.  Yet the authorities
make it
plain that the rule should operate in such cases, unless the particular
circumstances suggest the positive risk of injustice.
 Such a risk may arise in
a number of ways.  It may arise where there is the accumulation of
circumstances, as is <b><i>Middis</i></b>.  It may arise because of the nature
of particular allegations made by an accused against a co-accused.  I am not
referring to matching
allegations of the type made by Mr Spathis against Mr
Patsalis, and Mr Patsalis against Mr Spathis.  Rather, particular allegations
may be made by a co-accused which are not gratuitous (and therefore not capable
of excision as a matter of discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 137)</a>, which are crucial to the
defence, and yet highly damaging to a co-accused.  The damage may occur either
because of the subject matter,
or because of the relevance of the allegation to
a crucial issue.  A further way in which there may be a  risk of injustice, in
the
context of cut-throat defences, is in circumstances where one accused has a
prior criminal history, and the other does not.  The
accused with the history
may, in a joint trial, feel some inhibition in giving evidence.  That may work
an injustice.
<P>

44  	Here, the <b><i>Middis</i></b> test is not satisfied.  It was
not suggested, nor could it be, that the Crown case against Mr Patsalis was
either significantly different
from, or significantly weaker than, the case
against his co-accused.  The risk contemplated by paragraph 3 of the test
(namely, that
a weaker case against Mr Patsalis will be made immeasurably
stronger by reason of the prejudicial material) does not arise.
<P>

45  	Nor do I believe that the allegations by Mr Spathis against Mr
Patsalis (with the possible exception of category 4, which I
will deal with
separately) are such that they carry the risk of a positive injustice against
Mr Patsalis.  No significant matters
of credit, creating an imbalance between
accused and co-accused, inhibiting one from entering the witness box, were
suggested, that
may warrant a separate trial.
<P>

<b>The Allegation of Gambling</b>
<P>

46  	Dealing, finally, with category 4, Mr Spathis made a number of
comments, which may be thought disparaging, concerning Mr Patsalis
as a
gambler.  He said this:  (Q31)
<P>

"... it was $16,000 which was a lot of money.  It's a lot of money.  This is
over a period of a year.  So anyway he kept coming
up with all these scams
which anyone would tell you that knows him, `I'm gunna get it here, I'm gunna
get it here', but look basically
he was just a, a gambler eventually, I, I, I
found out and he gambled every cent that I'd ever given him.  And his brother
had warned
me up until about a week ago, two weeks ago that, `Don't ever give
him any more money because he's, he's, he just gambles it', he
said, it's like
he's addicted like somebody was to, to drugs."
<P>

47  	Mr Spathis described how he lent Mr Patsalis his car to meet Mr
Ludwig in order to complete a transaction from Mr Patsalis
would receive money.
Mr Spathis hoped to be repaid from that money.  He explained why he accompanied
Mr Patsalis on the evening of
11 April in these words:  (Q43, p10)
<P>

"'You're gunna get all your money back tonight and I'll bring it, bring it over
to you at the shop.'  Well, `not bring it over to
you at the shop' `cause I was
gunna be with him and he's gunna give it to me there or, you know, whatever -
the way he's gunna do
the transaction, he was gunna bring it over so that's why
I wanted to be there because I said I want to take it right there and then
but
he was gunna say, `No, I'll give it to you at the shop', but I didn't want him
to do that because I knew he'd go and gamble that
money.  Anyway it's a long
story."
<P>

48  	Mr Patsalis, in his interview, described the circumstances in
which Mr Spathis loaned him $16,500.  He acknowledged that he
had lied to Mr
Spathis (Q24, p6), that he had shown him false documents (Q24, p6), including a
letter from his solicitors, which
he had forged (Q24, p6).  The use by Mr
Spathis of the word "scam" in his interview is not prejudicial to Mr Patsalis
in the context
of Mr Patsalis' own account of his actions.  Mr Patsalis
described what he did with the money, or part of the money he received from
Mr
Spathis.  He said this:  (Q24, p7)
<P>

"The reason I did this was to gain some more money from him, ie $5000 so as I
could go to the races, Rosehill racecourse and win
back the money so as I could
pay him back in full.  Unfortunately for me and him I could not win and lost
the lot on the same day.
 This made my situation worse."
<P>

49  	Mr Patsalis elaborated upon that answer later in the interview
(Q61).  Towards the end of the interview, Mr Patsalis provided
the following
answers to the police:  (p71)
<P>

"Q243  Michael, is it fair to say that you have a - quite a serious gambling
problem?
<P>

A,  Yes, it is fair.
<P>

Q244  And how much money would you normally gamble in a week?
<P>

A.  Could be 500 to 1000.
<P>

Q245  Because of your gambling problem, did you feel any pressure to comply
with Alex's requests to assist him in recovering the
money?
<P>

A.  To recover the money but not by killing anybody."
<P>

50  	Given these statements, I do not believe that any significant
prejudice to Mr Patsalis arises as a consequence of the statements
made about
him by Mr Spathis on this subject.
<P>

<b>The Reference to Guns</b>
<P>

51  	Mr Spathis, in his interview, described his actions immediately
after Mr Ludwig was stabbed.  He said this:  (Q48, p14)
<P>

"I opened the door quickly because I thought something was gunna happen to me
and I, I looked and they were scuffling and I closed
the door and they..."
<P>

52  	He also said that he was "scared for myself" (Q55).  In that
context he provided the following answers:  (p 15/16)
<P>

"Q56  Was there anything else that you noticed prior to getting out of the
van?
<P>

A.  No.  Just, just that I knew something was happening and, you know, and -
well, prior to this Michael had been kept talking about
guns and how he can get
guns cheap and how he can sell `em and this and that so I, I thought in my head
there was a gun and so I
said, `Shit, if there's gunna' - sorry, `If there's
gunna be a gun then something's gunna happen to me, I'm gunna get shot'.
<P>

Q57  Did you ...
<P>

A.  `Cause he owes me this money.  `Cause this - I've always been thinking, he
owes me this money why doesn't he .. why wouldn't
he want to get rid of me so
then he won't have to pay me back this money.
<P>

Q57  Did you hear, hear of anything during the struggle which you'd describe as
a discharge of a firearm?
<P>

A.  No."
<P>

53  	This material is obviously important to Mr Spathis' defence.  It
is also highly prejudicial to Mr Patsalis.
<P>

54  	However, when one goes to the interview provided by Mr Patsalis
on the same evening, a number of allegations are made against
Mr Spathis
concerning firearms.  They include the following (referring to 11 April 1996,
the date of the incident):  (Q24, p10)
<P>

"Alex picked me up from my home and drove me to Bankstown McDonalds - we ate.
He then asked me to go for a walk with him.  He asked
me if I could get a gun.
I asked him why he needed one.  He told me how simple it would be to take money
off somebody if a gun was
pointed at them.  I said to him, `What are, what are
you planning on doing?'  He said he would - he could rob somebody that he knew
without hurting them.  I said to him that I could not kill anybody or point a
gun at them."
<P>

55  	Mr Patsalis, later in the interview, referred to an occasion
where the subject of firearms, and robbing someone, was again
raised by Mr
Spathis (Q67, p19).
<P>

56  	This being the context, I am not persuaded that, on this aspect,
there is prejudice to Mr Patsalis which is incapable of being
dealt with by
direction.
<P>

<b>The Electronic Interview</b>
<P>

57  	Counsel for the applicant drew attention to the impact of an
electronic interview upon the jury.  He referred to the judgment
of Dowd J in
<b><i>R v Piller</i></b> (unreported, 6 June 1995), where the following was
said:  (at 18)
<P>

"My concern about the current proceedings is that the very strong impact of
ERISP interviews distort the effect of directions given
to the jury by the
trial judge, whose directions are only given orally and lessened, in their
effect, because of that fact.  The
ERISP interviews have such high impact that
directions, such as the admissibility of certain evidence against particular
accused,
are of limited impact."
<P>

58  	The case before Dowd J involved four co-accused.  No doubt, as
the number of co-accused increases, so does the potential sources
of possible
prejudice.  It will be noticed, however, that his Honour directed that some
only of the accused be tried separately.
 Moreover, electronic interviews have
been used in police investigations for some time.  Yet the principles,
including those relating
to cut-throat defences, have been reaffirmed,
notwithstanding the impact of such interviews.  <b><i>Fernando</i></b> was a
case in which the material damaging to the co-accused (although not admissible
against him) was conveyed by means of an electronic
interview
(<b><i>Fernando</i></b> at p98, para 196;  p106, para 220).  The Court of
Criminal Appeal, nonetheless, concluded that a joint trial was appropriate.
<P>

59  	Here many of the witnesses are common to both Mr Spathis and Mr
Patsalis.  Plainly, there is significant convenience in a joint
trial.  That is
a factor, although not a large factor, and something to be put to one side if
there is the risk of positive injustice.
 I am not persuaded, however, that
there is such a risk.  Accordingly I refuse the application.  The matter should
proceed as a joint
trial.
<P>
