<b>JUDGMENT -- Ex Tempore</b>
<P>

<b>7 May 1999</b>
<P>

1	Following my earlier judgment of 5 May 1999 dismissing the Plaintiff's
Summons, it remains to deal with costs. The only issue
is whether I should, in
the circumstances of this case, depart from the normal rule and award costs on
the more generous indemnity
basis rather than the usual party and party costs.
This is pursuant to the court's inherent power in that behalf and under s76 of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a>.
<P>

2	The discretion to award indemnity costs arises in limited categories of case.
I am not here concerned with that category where
an offer of compromise is
declined where the judgment later entered is no less favourable than the
original offer. Nor am I concerned
with the category of case where the
Defendant has disputed a fact which is later proved or admitted. It is the
inherent jurisdiction
which is in point. It is exemplified by persisting in
proceedings which have no reasonable prospect of success or commencing or
continuing
proceedings for some ulterior motive, often borne out by the lack of
any real substance in the case itself. As was said by Sheppard
J in
<i>Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2043%20FCR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 43 FCR 225</a> at 234 (quoting
from the decision of French J in <i>J-Corp Pty Ltd v Australian Builders
Labourers Federation Union of Workers, WA Branch (No. 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2046%20IR%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 46 IR 301</a>
at 303):
<P>

	"Although there is said to be a presumption in such cases that the action was
commenced or continued for some ulterior motive or
in wilful disregard of known
facts or clearly established law, it is not a necessary condition of the power
to award such costs that
a collateral purpose or some species of fraud be
established. It is sufficient, in my opinion, to enliven the discretion to
award
such costs that, for whatever reason, the party persists in what should
on proper consideration be seen to be a hopeless case."
<P>

3	The relevant principles are conveniently assembled in the judgment of Rolfe
AJA in <i>Huntsman Chemical Co Australia Ltd v International Pools Australia
Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 242</a> at 271-3. (He was in dissent, but the
principles were not questioned.)
<P>

4	For present purposes I am here concerned with the earlier mentioned two
sub-categories within the inherent jurisdiction of the
court, namely that the
proceedings had no reasonable prospect of success or the proceedings have been
commenced or continued for
some ulterior or collateral purpose.
<P>

5	To express the sub-categories in this way is not to suggest that they are
necessarily capable of being viewed as totally distinct
in their application.
It may be that a case is a very weak one but just falls short of being
hopeless; the present case is just such
a borderline one. Yet that fact, when
coupled with the lateness with which the challenge is mounted, may in the
particular circumstances
of the case point to an ulterior purposes of the kind
that should warrant the award of indemnity costs. That is what I say occurred
here, for reasons which I now elaborate.
<P>

6	Turning to the circumstances presently before me, at para 77 of my earlier
judgment of 5 May 1999 I said:
<P>

	"There has developed a pattern in takeover defences in indulging in wasteful
and expedient tactical litigation, designed not for
the benefit of ensuring
that shareholders are properly informed but simply to buy time. To issue
proceedings such as this at the
last minute casts doubt upon the bona fides of
the Plaintiff, an impression reinforced by a number of other grounds raised and
subsequently
abandoned as to the alleged misleading nature of the Part A
Statement. That is not to say that in a proper case where a Part A statement
is
misleading the target should not take proper action promptly to restrain the
sending out of the offer or at any rate restrain
it until appropriate
additional material has been included. This was not such a case."
<P>

7	The Plaintiff originally advanced seven grounds for complaint, abandoned five
in this Court though pursuing one in the AAT, leaving
but two. It would be
going too far to say that those two grounds constituted a hopeless case though
for the reasons set out in my
judgment I considered that the case was extremely
weak.
<P>

8	As to timing, the Part A, the subject of the Plaintiff's attack, was served
on 19 April 1999. Proceedings for an injunction require
prompt action. Yet
those proceedings were only commenced on 30 April 1999, including claims later
abandoned. This was said by Counsel
to-day, from the bar table, to be the
result of the complexity of the litigation reflecting some question, which the
Plaintiff needed
first to resolve, as to whether and when the Defendant first
received the Information Memorandum said to include the confidential
information. However, it appears that the Plaintiff never asked the Defendant,
or indeed Gulf, that question, but worked the position
out for itself. That is
not surprising. The Plaintiff must have known from the Part A that the
Defendant had also sought information
concerning the purchase of the Gulf
assets. Thus it would be extraordinary if the Defendant had not received the
Information Memorandum,
even if the timing were an issue -- though even that
seems hardly likely, in view of para 2.4 of the Part A. But even if timing were
the issue, prompt enquiry should have clarified the matter, if not from the
Defendant then from Gulf.
<P>

9	The Plaintiff has had the benefit of expert advice from a leading law firm.
Like the plaintiff in <i>Huntsman Chemical</i> (supra) at 271
<P>

	"...... the litigation was commercial litigation and parties who and which
engage in it are taken, generally speaking, to be aware
of the commercial
ramifications of what they are doing."
<P>

The Plaintiff must therefore be taken to be aware that the timing of the
dispatch of a Part A offer earlier served and registered
is dependent upon the
Defendant having the opportunity to resolve any challenge to it. That means the
challenge should not be unreasonably
delayed. It was in my view, totally within
the control of the Plaintiff to have brought the injunction proceedings earlier
in time
to enable the injunction proceedings to be resolved, one way or the
other. It chose not to do so for reasons which can reasonably
be inferred to
have been associated with attempts to find other bidders and to prevent the
Defendant's Part A being dispatched at
all.
<P>

10	While, in my view, the foregoing circumstances are sufficient to justify the
conclusion that the Plaintiff's proceedings were
brought for an ulterior
purpose and not in good faith, it is not without relevance that Cultus issued a
press release on 6 May 1999
which contained these paragraphs in particular
which I quote below:
<P>

"Cultus Chairman Mark Dunphy said Cultus had taken legal action because its
Board felt that Cultus shareholders may have been disadvantaged
had there not
been clarification of a number of issues in OMV's Part A offer.
<P>

 ......
<P>

The court decided the relevant information in OMV's possession did not need to
be disclosed in the Part A statement. The information
remains confidential
until it has been fully considered by the Joint Venture participants. Cultus
expects to be authorised to disclose
the information in its Part B statement
following discussions with the other Joint Venture participants."
<P>

11	I expressed concern to-day that the first quotation is hardly consistent in
its suggestion of merely seeking <i>clarification</i> of issues raised by the
Part A, when the evident purpose of the proceedings was to obtain a final
injunction preventing the dispatch
of OMVA's offer altogether. It is true the
Plaintiff put its case then on alternative bases that would have permitted
dispatch, if
supplemented by the alleged confidential information. But clearly
enough the Plaintiff's primary submission was that the Part A offer
could never
be dispatched for so long as the relevant information remained confidential.
<P>

12	There was no suggestion that the Plaintiff would itself release the relevant
information in the absence of a valid Part A offer.
Indeed to the contrary, it
was asserted by Plaintiff's Counsel on the first day of the hearing that the
relevant information would,
or could, be included in a Part B response only
upon receipt of a valid Part A offer but then it would be released.
<P>

13	That leads to my concern about the second of the quoted paragraphs from the
Press Release. The second sentence, probably unintentionally,
may suggest that
the court decided what the second sentence says, when in fact that was not said
anywhere in my judgment. Of particular
concern though is that it clearly
implies that authorisation of the joint venture participants is legally
required before Cultus
<i>could</i> disclose the information in its Part B
statement, though it "expects to be authorised". That supposed need for
authorisation was
not mentioned by way of qualification when the statements in
12 above were made in Court. Indeed it could not have been, because
the joint
venture would then clearly permit such inclusion in the Part B, where Cultus is
required by applicable law, namely s750
of the <i>Corporations Law</i> to
include such information, though confidential, drawing upon its additional
knowledge from the joint venture, where it is 
<P>

(a)  material, and 
<P>

(b)  can be substantiated so not misleading. 
<P>

14	It is for Cultus to ensure that any statements it issues both accurately
state the effect of the Court's decision and in a way
that is not capable of
being misleading. Similarly Cultus must accurately state, without being
misleading, the position concerning
the ultimate release of the relevant
information in its Part B statement. It is important that any misleading
impression be corrected.
For present purposes it is simply appropriate that I
note that the press release is, at the least, not inconsistent with the
ulterior
purpose to which I have earlier made reference.
<P>

15	It follows that in the circumstances of this case the exceptional
jurisdiction of the Court to award indemnity costs should be
exercised. It is
important that the courts give a clear signal that tactics reflected in that
ulterior purpose are not to be rewarded
by merely putting at risk party and
party costs. I should add that the vice does not lie in the litigation being
tactical -- litigation
often is. Rather the vice lies in the lack of bona fides
or legitimacy reflected in the delay in presenting what was undoubtedly
a weak
case, knowing that shareholders could thereby be deprived of a bid or have it
delayed by the litigation. This was a bid that
currently maintained the share
price of Cultus and was the basis of trading in its stock. In <i>Huntsman
Chemical</i>, though concluding that an indemnity cost order was not warranted,
Kirby P (at 246) recognised the appropriateness of indemnity cost
orders as
conveying a salutary message:
<P>

	"An indemnity cost order would send a salutary message as a consequence of its
being made in a case such as the present. That message
would be that litigants,
at least in commercial cases such as the present, run the risk, in hopeless
appeals, that the full commercial
costs of their litigious adventure will be
transferred, by order of the court, to the party or parties bringing such a
hopeless appeal
(or an appeal on grounds which are hopeless). The Court is
entitled, in modern circumstances of enlarged attention to the efficient
administration of justice, to keep in mind the consequence of an indemnity
costs order not only for the particular parties before
it but for the signal
which it sends about the due administration of justice in like cases: cf
<i>Milosevic v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31
NSWLR 323</a> at 328."
<P>

16	I should add that abandonment of unwinable appeals or points, while not to
be discouraged by indemnity cost orders as Kirby P
said in Huntsman Chemical
(supra) at 247, nonetheless may, with other circumstances present here, point
to a weak case or an ulterior
purpose, or both.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

17	I order that the Plaintiff pay the Defendant's costs on the Summons and
Cross-claim on an indemnity basis such costs to be assessed
forthwith.
