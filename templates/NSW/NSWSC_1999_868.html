<b>Monday, 30 August 1999</b>
<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1    	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  The plaintiff, Robert John
Worthington, has brought proceedings in this Court against two doctors and two
hospitals seeking damages
for negligence.  The claim against the first
defendant, Dr Nabeel Ibrahim, relates to surgery he performed upon the
plaintiff for
an hiatus hernia which resulted in the perforation of the
plaintiff's oesophagus.  The plaintiff issued a subpoena directed to the
Heath
Care Complaints Commission to produce various documents, including documents
relating to any complaint (other than that relating
to the plaintiff himself)
received by the Commission alleging negligence on Dr Ibrahim's part during
operative procedures. 
<P>

2    	In response to the subpoena, the Commission produced
a volume of material and did not claim public interest immunity in respect
of
any of it.  However, objection was taken to the parties being given access to
two of the files.  Registrar Irwin declined to grant
access to those files and
his decision was affirmed upon review by Master Malpass.  The plaintiff has
appealed against the Master's
decision.  Access is not now pressed in respect
of one of the files.  Accordingly, the appeal relates only to the remaining
file,
which answers the description of a complaint of negligence on the part of
Dr Ibrahim during operative procedures. 
<P>

3    	Master Malpass did not inspect the file.  He was
informed  that the complaint arose from operative treatment for a hernia,
but
by a procedure different from that performed upon the plaintiff.  It was argued
for the plaintiff that he was entitled to access
to it in an effort to "build
up an evidentiary mosaic", the expression used by Rolfe J in <i>Lakatoi
Universal Pty Ltd v Walker</i> (Rolfe J, unreported, 6 November 1998).  In
particular, it was asserted that the file might assist in cross-examination,
lead to
further inquiry and, possibly, to amendment of the pleadings.  Master
Malpass was unpersuaded by this argument, saying that he was
not satisfied that
the file had "apparent relevance" to the proceedings: <i>National Employers'
Mutual General v Waind and Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NSWLR 372</a>, per Moffitt P at
385.
<P>

4    	That was sufficient to dispose of the matter, but the
Master found further support for his decision in other considerations.
 He
referred to the complainant's interest in privacy, given the personal nature of
the information necessarily contained in the
file.  He referred also to the
fact that the Commission is a public body having statutory responsibilities,
and the Act which governs
it contains the usual provision prohibiting
disclosure of information obtained by it except in certain circumstances: s37
of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hcca1993204/" class="autolink_findacts">Health Care Complaints Act</a></i>,<i> </i>1993.  (Under that section
disclosure may be made with "lawful excuse" which, of course, includes
production of records in answer
to a subpoena.)
<P>

5    	With respect, it appears to me that the Master has
measured apparent relevance by too narrow a test.  True it is the file
does not
relate to the surgery performed upon the plaintiff.  However, it could lead to
further inquiry and, possibly, provide material
admissible as tendency evidence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">s97</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, 1995.  Equally, it might be a source of
material for use in cross-examination.  To adopt the words of Waddell J in
<i>Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20921" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 921</a> at 927,
"...it is reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the
relevant evidence in the case."
<P>

6    	For more abundant caution, I have inspected the file
and I should say that the Master's description of the medical condition
of the
complainant is not entirely accurate.  That said, my inspection has done
nothing to change my view.
<P>

7    	I am conscious of the sensitivity of a file of this
kind and the need to have regard to the interests of the complainant:
cf
<i>Waind and Hill</i> at 383.  In accordance with common practice, the
complainant's name and address have been obliterated from the file prior to
production
to the Court.  The file discloses a source through whom the
complainant might be contacted, but that contact would be possible only
if he
or she were willing to communicate with the plaintiff's legal advisers.  In the
circumstances, it appears to me that the privacy
of that person is adequately
protected.
<P>

8    	Before me counsel for the Commission, whose
submissions were adopted by counsel for Dr Ibrahim, argued that access should
be refused as a matter of public policy.  In addition to s37 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hcca1993204/" class="autolink_findacts">Health
Care Complaints Act</a></i>, he referred to the beneficial objects of the Act set
out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hcca1993204/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s3</a>, which include facilitation of "the maintenance of standards of
health services in New South Wales".  He argued that the risk of
disclosure of
the Commission's records in the course of litigation might inhibit citizens
from making complaints and might affect
the candour with which doctors
responded to them.  This really is a claim for public interest immunity, which
should have been made
prior to or at the time of production and have been
supported by evidence.  In any event, the privacy of complainants would
normally
be protected by the obliteration of their names and any other
information which might tend to identify them.  Equally, given the
disciplinary
powers conferred by the Act, it is not apparent to me how the candour of a
doctor's response to a complaint might be
affected by the risk of its being
used in litigation.
<P>

9    	Accordingly, I am satisfied that Master Malpass fell
into error in his approach to the matter, both as to the apparent relevance
of
the material and as to the other considerations which were raised.  I am
unpersuaded by an argument before me that the plaintiff's
interest in the
matter would be met by discovery and interrogatories.  The appeal should be
allowed and the parties should have access
to the relevant file (94/1279).
Before formally granting access, I shall hear counsel as to whether any further
material should be
edited from it and as to conditions, if any, upon which
access should be permitted.  I shall hear the parties on costs.
