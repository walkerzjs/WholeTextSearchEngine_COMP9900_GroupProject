MASTER MALPASS
<P>

WEDNESDAY 13 OCTOBER 1999
<P>

<u>11609/1994</u>	<u>CBFC LIMITED v KENNETH JAMES AUSTIN &amp; DIANE CHRISTINA
AUSTIN</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced in 1994.  The plaintiff's case
is as pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim filed on 4 March
1996.  The
defendants both defend the plaintiff's claim and bring their own Cross-claim.
The pleading relied on at the trial is the
Further Amended Defence and
Cross-claim filed on 4 May 1995.  It was filed by solicitors who had acted for
the defendants earlier
in the proceedings.
<P>

2  	The hearing commenced on 16 August 1999.  It concluded on 20
September 1999 (at the end of about six hearing days).  The plaintiff
has been
represented by counsel.  Both defendants are unrepresented.  They are husband
and wife.  The second defendant (being the
wife) has authorised the first
defendant (being the husband) to conduct the case on her behalf.  Without
objection, the first defendant
has in fact put the case on behalf of both
defendants.  This course was not without its problems.  I shall return to one
aspect in
due course.
<P>

3  	In presenting its case in chief, the plaintiff has relied on two
affidavits.  The first was sworn by Mr Huggins and the second
was sworn by Mr
Akhurst.  Both deponents have been cross-examined.
<P>

4  	The defendants have relied on a number of affidavits.  These
affidavits were relied on in support of both their Defence and
the Cross-claim.
Both defendants were cross-examined.
<P>

5  	The parties have placed a formidable body of documentation before
the court.  In due course, I will make express reference to
some of this
material.
<P>

6  	By way of reply and defence to the Cross-claim, the plaintiff
relied on affidavits sworn by Messrs Barton, Jongeneelen and Moody.
 All of
these deponents were cross-examined at length.
<P>

7  	The defendants have been directors of Australian Padding Company
Pty Limited (APC) and other corporations.  They were shareholders
in APC.  In
about October 1987, it had acquired the business and assets of Australian
Cotton Manufacturing Company Limited for $2,000,000.
 On 20 November 1987 APC
granted a Mortgage Debenture in favour of the Australia &amp; New Zealand
Banking Group Limited (ANZ). 
APC then needed finance to acquire the business
and assets of "Upholstery &amp; Wadding Supplies".  Westpac, who had been the
banker
for APC, was unresponsive to a request for a loan facility for this
purpose.  ANZ then became its banker.
<P>

8  	On 31 January 1991, APC and Gelman Sciences Pty Ltd (Gelman)
entered into an Asset Sale And Purchase Agreement (which the first
defendant
describes as the purchase of a non-woven production plant).  The price was
$792,000.  Mr Moody was engaged to obtain finance
for APC.  He was a director
of Moody Kiddell &amp; Partners Pty limited (Lease, Finance and Mortgage
Brokers). An approach was made
to the plaintiff.  A formal offer to provide
finance made by the plaintiff was accepted (a resolution was passed at a
meeting of
directors held on 15 March 1991).  The financial arrangements
involved inter alia the defendants giving both a personal guarantee
and a
mortgage over a property now known as 51 Cummins Road Menangle Park (the
property) to secure that guarantee.  APC was to enter
into a Hire Purchase
Agreement.
<P>

9  	At a meeting of directors held on 2 April 1991, it was resolved
that the Hire Purchase Agreement be signed under the Common
Seal.  The Common
Seal was affixed and it was signed by the defendants at the meeting.  The
guarantee (Exhibit A) was executed on
the same day.  On 5 April 1991 the
mortgage was executed.  The Asset Sale And Purchase Agreement was completed on
9 April 1991. 
The plant acquired from Gelman was located at Lot 2, Stonney
Batter Road, Minto and APC operated a leased factory on those premises.
<P>

10  	On 30 September 1992, ANZ appointed Mr Royal as Receiver to
APC's assets and undertakings.  On 9 October 1992, APC failed to
make an
instalment under the Hire Purchase Agreement.  On 9 November 1992, APC failed
to make a further instalment under the Hire
Purchase Agreement.  The Hire
Purchase Agreement was terminated on 25 November 1992.  (by then it had paid 17
of the 59 monthly instalments).
 Subsequently, APC went into liquidation.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff sold encumbered plant and equipment to Insulco Pty
Limited (Insulco).  The net proceeds of the sale left a shortfall.
 On 25 June
1993, demand was made under the guarantee.  On 28 March 1994, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> (2) (b)
notices under the provisions of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</u> 1900</a> were served.
The plaintiff's claim has been recently the subject of an estimate in the order
of $543,000.  However, this is subject
to a credit adjustment which the
plaintiff (without conceding that the defendants have an entitlement to such
adjustment) is prepared
to allow.  A judgment in the order of $493,000 is now
sought.  No payment has been made by the defendants.  They take the view that
if certain things had been done there would not have been any debt owed to the
plaintiff.
<P>

12  	I closely observed the demeanour of witnesses during the giving
of oral evidence.  In assessing credibility I have had regard
to both evidence
and demeanour.
<P>

13  	The evidence given by Messrs Huggins and Akhurst was largely
formal.  An attack was made on the credibility of each of Messrs
Barton,
Jongeneelen and Moody.  Largely, their evidence was unshaken.  Mr Barton is a
chartered accountant now employed by Pioneer
USA Inc.  He is now based
overseas. He was required to return to Australia to give evidence in this case.
I shall return to his evidence
later in this judgment.  Both Messrs Jongeneelen
(a former employee of APC) and Moody were impressive witnesses.  I accept them
as
credible and reliable witnesses.  In particular, Mr Moody's evidence
demolished many of the red herrings which the defendants had
sought to raise
throughout the hearing.  The defendants devoted much time to propounding the
assertion that Mr Moody had been engaged
by and was the agent of the plaintiff.
This assertion was completely unfounded.  There was overwhelming evidence to
the contrary.
 Further there was evidence that he had acted in a similar
capacity on previous occasions.
<P>

14  	The first defendant was disposed at times to take an aggressive
stance.  He was accustomed to the role of Chairman of the Board
of Directors
and Managing Director.  His wife says that he "has always had a dominant
personality".  There is conflict between his
evidence and that given by others.
At times, his evidence was inaccurate.  He was disposed to persist with
assertions which must
have been known to him to be untrue.  He appeared to be
concerned to throw up as much doubt and confusion as possible without directing
his mind to the crucial consideration of whether or not the attack really
assisted the defendants' cause.  He has given evidence
that I do not accept.
<P>

15  	The defendants were married in 1985.  The second defendant says
that since the marriage, she has been guided and advised by
her husband.  She
has worked in various clerical and stenographic jobs (including with APC).  Her
employment was terminated by the
Receiver in November 1992.  She was a director
of APC until 3 December 1992.
<P>

16  	There was a lengthy cross-examination of the second defendant.
Unfortunately, she presented as an evasive witness who persisted
with a
reluctance to give responsive answers to questions.  This characteristic
necessitated a repetition of questioning (sometimes
it was necessary to ask the
same or a similar question on a number of occasions).  She has given evidence
that I do not accept.
<P>

17  	Her evidence in chief is to be found principally in the
affidavit sworn on 20 June 1995.  Largely, it deposes to matters relied
on in
support of a claim made pursuant to the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</u> 1980</a> (the
Act).  It seeks to present a picture of a wife who did what she was instructed
to do by her husband.  The affidavit contained
inter alia the following:-
<P>

"On the business side of things, my husband instructed me to sign various lease
agreements, hire purchase agreements and mortgages.
 My husband always told me
to make myself available at a specified time and date to sign any such
documents.  I recall questioning
this at some early stage, but I was told `If
you don't sign them, then I'll get someone who will.'  In order to keep the
peace within
both my business life and my married life, I simply did as I was
told and signed as instructed.  It was always just a formality.
 I understood
business was good, and prospects were good and never in my wildest dreams did I
ever envisage that any one of these
guarantees would ever be called up and I
would be reduced to the sorry state I am in today.  As a result, a number of
guarantees
were signed with my husband, Kenneth James Austin, and the parent,
Glenora, when APC purchased cars, trucks and forklifts over a
period of about
five years from about July 1987 to some time before the 30 September 1992.
Some of these were hire purchase agreements
and some were leasing agreements.
I do not have the details or records of these."
<P>

18  	At this point, it is convenient to briefly digress to deal with
a related matter.  This affidavit material threw up a potential
conflict
between her position and that of her husband (who was acting on her written
authority to present her case).  Further, this
evidence cast doubt on the
authority.  She was made aware of the position and given an opportunity to seek
independent legal advice.
 She declined that opportunity and informed the court
that she wanted to proceed with the existing arrangements.
<P>

19  	As both defendants have advanced a claim for relief under the
Act, at this stage it is convenient to deal with those claims.
 I shall first
deal with the wife's claim.
<P>

20  	There is no doubt that she knew that she had signed both a
mortgage over the property and a personal guarantee.  She had participated
in
the conduct of the meetings during which execution had taken place.
<P>

21  	The contents of the affidavit do not suggest that she did not
understand the effect of the documents signed by her (including
documents such
as mortgages and personal guarantees).  It does reveal that previously she had
been a party to various security documents
(including mortgages and personal
guarantees).  A mortgage had been given to ANZ to enable the purchase of the
property.  A further
mortgage had been given to ANZ over their home at Minto
Heights.  This was part of the collateral security given to ANZ for advances
provided by it.
<P>

22  	Initially in her cross-examination, she appeared to give the
impression that she lacked understanding of the documents signed
by her.  Later
she appeared to have moved to the position where she accepted that she did have
understanding of documents signed
by her.  Even later she gave expression to a
belief or understanding which differed from the actual effect of the security
documents
(a belief or understanding that the plaintiff should first pursue its
rights against APC).  This evidence was not impressive and
I do not accept it.
Further, it should be added that it was not said that the plaintiff bore any
responsibility for her having such
a belief or understanding.  I am not
satisfied that she lacked understanding as to the effect of the documents
signed by her.
<P>

23  	She had been a director of various companies (including APC and
Glenora).  It appears that the minutes of meetings of directors
were not mere
formalities but in fact recorded what actually happened at each meeting.  She
took notes during the meetings and prepared
the minutes for signature by her
husband (including the relevant meetings at which consideration was given to
the matters of the
mortgage and guarantee).  There was a procedure which was
followed where the execution of documents was to take place.  Documents
were
either executed during or after the holding of the meeting.
<P>

24  	In cross-examination, she conceded that she was prepared to
leave it to her husband to make business decisions for both of
them, and that
she was content to do whatever he wanted her to do.  She conceded that she
would not do anything that she did not
want to do.  Also, she said that she
signed documents because she saw it as being in her best interests to do so.
<P>

25  	It appears that Mr Elvy of Henry Davis York had acted for both
the Austin family and the companies over many years.  He was
employed in
relation to the Gelman transaction.  He was available to give any advice that
may have been required by the Austins.
 If they did not get any advice from him
concerning the transaction, it may well be that this was because they did not
consider that
any advice was necessary.
<P>

26  	The property is not the home of the defendants.  It was regarded
as an investment.  The first defendant had referred to it
as their
"Superannuation Fund".
<P>

27  	The relevant documentation was in standard form.  Reference has
been made to certain provisions (including Memorandum R361020).
 I am not
satisfied that any of these provisions gave rise to injustice.
<P>

28  	Whilst the challenge to this documentation occupied some
considerable hearing time, the real thrust of the defendants' complaints
seemed
to be largely directed at the aftermath of default and what was done by the
plaintiff and ANZ in realising security.  This
aspect of the case generated the
attack made in relation to the Hire Purchase Agreement.
<P>

29  	The reasons for default being made both to ANZ and to the
plaintiff appear to relate to poor business performance on the part
of APC in
circumstances where it became financially over-committed.  It operated a number
of factories both in NSW and Victoria.
 One of them (the factory located at
Minto) had been operating at a loss for some time.  It is not suggested that
the default arose
because of anything done by the plaintiff.
<P>

30  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> of the Act confers a discretion on the court to grant
any one or more of the heads of relief identified therein where it finds that
certain threshold requirements have been satisfied (inter alia, where it finds
a contract to have been unjust in the circumstances
relating to it at the time
it was made).  See <u>Nguyen v Taylor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 48</a> at 55-57 and 71-72
and <u>Younan &amp; Anor v Beneficial Finance Corporation Limited</u> (Court of
Appeal, unreported, 21 November 1994).  It may grant relief if it considers it
just to do so and for the purpose of avoiding
as far as practicable an unjust
consequence or result.  
<P>

31  	I have had regard to all of the material advanced on behalf of
the second defendant.  In my view, she falls well short of satisfying
the
relevant threshold requirements and/or demonstrating an entitlement to
relief.
<P>

32  	The claim advanced on behalf of the first defendant is clearly
hopeless.  Largely, this was recognised by him during the conduct
of the case.
He was an experienced businessman who had been involved in a number of large
transactions.  He had been engaged in the
raising of finance on previous
occasions.  He had been a party to many security documents.  I am satisfied
that he understood the
nature and effect of both a mortgage and personal
guarantee.  Such evidence as he may have given to the contrary, I do not
accept.
 In the course of the presentation of the case, he unwittingly
described himself as "an experienced company director" (Transcript
p 216).  He
had access to legal advice.  He entered into the purchase from Gelman for what
he regarded as very good business reasons
("it was like winning Lotto").
<P>

33  	I shall now deal with one of the other areas of Defence and/or
Cross-claim. It is a discrete matter.  It has been referred
to as the
"longfall" claim.  It involves what was done in relation to three other Hire
Purchase Agreements.  These agreements dealt
with the hiring of several
forklifts and trucks.  Mr Royal as Receiver for ANZ exercised the rights of the
hirer under the agreements
(rights of election pursuant to clause 5).  The
amounts owing to the plaintiff under each of the agreements were paid out and
title
to the assets passed to APC.  APC subsequently sold the assets.  The sale
was said to produce a profit or surplus of $133,972.
<P>

34  	The defendants contend that the amount of the surplus should be
set-off against any amounts then owing by APC to the plaintiff
under the
subject Hire Purchase Agreement.  At one stage of the proceedings, it was said
that this argument was founded on the principle
of marshalling.  It was never
really explained how the principle had application in the circumstances of this
case.  In my view,
this contention is misconceived and should be rejected.
<P>

35  	I shall now move to other areas of complaint which appear to
emerge largely from the pleadings and were the subject of submissions.
 Other
areas of complaint were raised from time to time during the hearing.  However,
these matters were not pleaded and/or the subject
of supporting evidence.  In
any event, they did not give rise to any good Defence or Cross-claim.
<P>

36  	One of the matters fervently agitated at length by the
defendants during the hearing related to the execution and content of
the Hire
Purchase Agreement.  The plaintiff has contended that the original is the
document which is Exhibit C.  The defendants propounded
a contrary view.  It
was said that this document was suspect and not genuine.  In endeavouring to
establish that view the authenticity
of the document was sought to be
challenged in a variety of ways.  For reasons I shall shortly give, it was not
an exercise which
could have assisted the defence of the plaintiff's claim.
<P>

37  	The case for the defendants rested largely on a document which
was said to come into their possession at a time well after
2 April 1991.  The
defendants look to this document as being the Hire Purchase Agreement.  This
was really a pointless exercise,
as the description of goods in all of the
versions of the agreement (including the description contained in this
document) were substantially
similar.  None of them included the spare parts.
A copy of the document is Annexure A to the affidavit sworn by the first
defendant
on 4 November 1994.  The defendants never did give a satisfactory
account of how the document came into their possession.  Initially
the first
defendant said that it came into his possession when a request was made to the
plaintiff for a copy of the Hire Purchase
Agreement.  He later changed his
stance and said that it was provided to him by Mr Moody.  Mr Moody vigorously
denies that suggestion
and I accept his evidence on that matter.  In the course
of his evidence, Mr Moody provided an explanation for the coming into being
of
that document (an unexplained combination which came from various of the
documents).  The explanation was persuasive.
<P>

38  	I now mention some of the ways in which the defendants sought to
cast doubt on the authenticity of Exhibit C.  The defendants
have raised doubt
as to whether or not their signatures appear on Exhibit C.  The evidence given
to that effect was unimpressive.
 It was not supported by any expert evidence.
It was contrary to the evidence given by Mr Moody.  The defendants raised doubt
concerning
the signature of Mr Staras (the Company Secretary at the time).
There is evidence which suggests that Mr Staras was available to
give evidence
if required to do so.  He was not called by the defendants to deal with this
question.  The minutes of the meeting
of directors have been signed by the
first defendant.  Those minutes record that Mr Staras was present at the
meeting.  The defendants
sought to make much of other minor discrepancies in
form in the various versions.  In my view these discrepancies have been
explained
and do not assist the defendants.
<P>

39  	I may add that it seems absurd to suggest that the plaintiff
engaged in an exercise of creating a document which in fact had
the effect of
giving it less security than it could have otherwise had (security over the
spare parts as well).  In my view, the
suggestions made by the defendants are
of no substance and lack significance.
<P>

40  	I accept the evidence given by Mr Moody relating to the Hire
Purchase Agreement.  It was a document that he had prepared. 
There were in
fact two originals (one of which was Exhibit C).  He was present when execution
took place at a meeting of directors
of APC.  He took the documents from the
meeting and gave them to the plaintiff.  He made a photocopy of one of the
originals (Exhibit
F).
<P>

41  	The subject matter of the Asset Sale And Purchase Agreement
included both equipment and spare parts.  The plant and equipment
was
identified by schedules to the agreement.
<P>

42  	The Hire Purchase Agreement had a schedule attached (Schedule
B).  There was no Schedule A (Mr Moody had prepared a Schedule
A but it became
the Schedule to an Authority to Complete).  The Hire Purchase Agreement was in
the standard form used by the plaintiff.
 The standard form did not contemplate
the use of a schedule to describe the subject goods.  Schedule B was similar to
Schedule 2
to the Asset Sale And Purchase Agreement.  In essence, it described
the plant and equipment which has been described as the "non-woven
production
line".  Those items were part of the subject matter of a valuation prepared by
Hymans.  Schedule B did not contain the
spare parts described in Schedule 3 to
the Asset Sale And Purchase Agreement.
<P>

43  	The defendants seek to mount a claim in relation to the spare
parts.  Both the nature of the claim itself and the basis upon
which it was put
was somewhat clouded.  This aspect of the defendants' case was referred to as
the Misallocated Goods Claim.
<P>

44  	It may be that it was sought to put a contention that the spare
parts were "goods" within the meaning of the Hire Purchase
Agreement.  If that
was the position, it was not a case that was pleaded.  For a reason that was
not made clear, it was said that
they should have been made the subject of that
agreement (and as a consequence the plaintiff gave away assets).  There was a
contention
that there was negligence on the part of the plaintiff in failing to
list them in the schedule.
<P>

45  	If this ultimate contention is founded on the premise of a duty
owed to a guarantor, the authorities make it clear that only
a wilful act or
neglect can absolve the surety (<u>Modderno v ANZ Bank</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA 13).</a>
The presence of these ingredients was not demonstrated in this case.
<P>

46  	The spare parts were sold by the Receiver to Insulco and the
proceeds of the sale applied to satisfy the indebtedness of ANZ.
 The
defendants say that they should have had the benefit of those proceeds and that
they should have been set off against the plaintiff's
claim.
<P>

47  	Whilst the various contentions involved in this part of the
defendants' case were not the subject of any real argument, I am
satisfied that
there is no substance in any of them. I am satisfied that Exhibit C is an
original of the Hire Purchase Agreement
executed on 2 April 1991.  Whatever may
have brought about the situation, I am satisfied that the Hire Purchase
Agreement did not
cover the spare parts.  Accordingly, the spare parts were not
the subject of any security held by the plaintiff.  I am not satisfied
that
there is any basis for the court reaching a view that they should have formed
part of the encumbered goods.  I am not satisfied
that there was any breach of
a duty of care.  In my view, the Misallocated Goods Claim fails.
<P>

48  	The defendants also claim that the plant and equipment (which
was the subject of the Hire Purchase Agreement) was sold at an
undervalue.
Leaving aside any other considerations, this claim was doomed to failure by
reason of evidentiary deficiencies.
<P>

49  	The sale to Insulco had two distinct aspects.  Firstly, there
was the sale of the encumbered plant and equipment by the plaintiff
(this was
listed in Schedule 2 to the agreement and was largely the goods in the Hire
Purchase Agreement (subject to a small discrepancy
relating to 3 specific
items) ).  This property was sold for the sum of $405,000.  Secondly, there was
a sale by APC (by the Receiver)
of balance plant, equipment etc (including the
spare parts) which was listed in Schedule 1.  This property was disposed of for
a
separate consideration ($195,000).
<P>

50  	The steps taken to effect the sale (such as extensive
advertising) may be found in the affidavit sworn by Mr Barton (who was
an
employee of Mr Royal).  The affidavit is redolent with detail and it is not
necessary to repeat it in this judgment.  In cross-examination
this evidence
was not the subject of any real challenge.  I accept his evidence on these
matters.
<P>

51  	I should digress to mention that the defendants complain that
they were not allowed sufficient involvement in the sale process.
 They were
permitted some involvement.  However, it was clearly well below what the
defendants required.
<P>

52  	Be that as it may, there was no obligation to permit the
defendants to have the conduct of the sale or even be involved in
it.  I am not
satisfied that this complaint in any way advances the defendants' case.
<P>

53  	Evidence of value may be found in a valuation made by Grey
Eisdell Timms Pty Limited (GET) dated 6 October 1992.  This valuation
had been
obtained by Mr Barton.  GET valued the goods on two bases.  One was referred to
as a "going concern" basis.  The other was
referred to as an "auction value".
The goods were valued on a "going concern" basis at $541,300.  The goods were
valued on an "auction
value" basis at $89,150.
<P>

54  	The substance of the defendants' complaint seems to be  that the
goods were sold at a price below the "going concern" basis.
 The problem for
the defendants is that the goods were not sold on that basis.  Mr Barton had
formed the view that the Minto operations
were not a viable going concern and
were not capable of being sold on such a basis in the light of the past poor
financial performance.
 In his view a sale as a complete unit (without
substantial removal expenses and auctioneer's costs) would realise a higher
value
than GET's auction valuation.  Mr Royal concurred with a recommendation
to that effect.  This was the basis of the subsequent sale
(which was completed
on 26 November 1992).  The price realised was in fact substantially above the
auction value.
<P>

55  	At the time of the sale, the obligations imposed at law upon the
owner under a Hire Purchase Agreement was that it was obliged
to act in good
faith and was not to wilfully or recklessly sacrifice the interest of the hirer
(see inter alia <u>Lacey v Bank of New Zealand</u> (Court of Appeal,
unreported, 5 December 1997) ).  Under clause 3 of the Hire Purchase Agreement,
the plaintiff's entitlement is
calculated by reference to a formula.  One
component of that formula is "the value of goods" which is defined as "the best
price
that could reasonably be obtained .............at the date of
termination".  For the purposes of these proceedings, the plaintiff
accepts
that it is obliged to give credit to the defendants for an amount equal to such
"best price".
<P>

56  	In relation to this aspect of the defendants' case, they bear
the relevant onus.  I am not satisfied that this onus has been
discharged.  In
my view, Mr Barton did get the best price that could reasonably be obtained in
the sense required by the Hire Purchase
Agreement.  There was no wilful or
reckless sacrifice or lack of good faith.  Accordingly, the complaint as to a
sale at an undervalue
also fails.
<P>

57  	This aspect of the defendants' case did generate other
contentions.  It was contended that duties of care were owed by the
plaintiff
and that there had been breach of those duties.  The matter of the existence of
any such duties was not really argued.
 It involves questions that need not be
pursued in this case.  Largely, the alleged duties were similar to the
obligations accepted
by the plaintiff.
<P>

58  	There was a challenge to the calculation of the amount of rebate
for credit charges.  The evidence as to calculation was provided
by Mr Akhurst.
Unfortunately for the defendants, I am of the view that this challenge is also
unsuccessful.  It was founded on certain
misconceptions (including an erroneous
assumption as to termination date).
<P>

59  	In my view, the various matters raised by the defendants either
by way of Defence or Cross-claim have failed.  The plaintiff
has established a
case for judgment both for possession and in a monetary sum.  The plaintiff is
entitled to an order for the costs
of the proceedings.  The exhibits may be
returned.
<P>

60  	The plaintiff seeks leave for the issue of a Writ of Possession.
This may be the subject of further argument and can be dealt
with at a
convenient time.
<P>

61  	The plaintiff is to prepare Short Minutes of Order.
