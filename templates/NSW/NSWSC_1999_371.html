<P>

<b>			TRIBUNAL &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Quash orders of Consumer Claims Tribunal;</b>
<P>

<b>  Denial of natural justice)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By amended summons filed 3 July 1998 the plaintiff seeks to
appeal against the decision of Mr Gilson a Referee of the Consumer Claims
Tribunal made on 22 April 1998.  The plaintiff relied on his affidavits sworn
19 May 1998, 3 August 1998 and 12 October 1998 and
affidavits of Joan
Bernadette Talbot sworn 10 August 1998 and Amanda Jane Mulligan sworn 10 August
1998.  The second defendant relied
on his affidavit sworn 2 October 1998 and on
the affidavit of Kerry Cowell sworn 2 October 1998.
<P>

2	The plaintiff was the respondent in proceedings in the Consumer Claims
Tribunal.  The second defendant was the claimant in the
proceedings in the
Consumer Claims Tribunal.  The first defendant has filed a submitting
appearance.
<P>

3	The issue to be determined is whether the appellant was denied natural
justice in the proceedings before Referee Gilson in the
Consumer Claims
Tribunal. 
<P>

4	The dispute before the Referee was whether the plaintiff, who was the
proprietor of Wauchope Mini Storage, disposed of the goods
that were stored in
his storage sheds in contravention of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uga1995179/" class="autolink_findacts">Uncollected Goods Act</a></b> 1995,
what were those goods and how much compensation should be awarded.  The
defendant was seeking compensation.  The Referee in
his reasons decided that he
preferred the corroborated evidence of the defendant as to the contents of the
storage shed.  As the
goods were over a certain value, the Referee held that
the plaintiff was required to dispose of the goods in accordance with the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uga1995179/" class="autolink_findacts">Uncollected Goods Act</a></b> 1995.  After he had looked at the defendant's list
of documents and his estimates of their "sale value" and replacement value, he
determined a fair and equitable measure of the defendant's loss as $6,500.  He
made orders accordingly.
<P>

5	I observed both the plaintiff and defendant both giving evidence and being
cross examined.  The plaintiff was not an impressive
witness.  Although he was
astute, he did not answer questions in a frank and convincing manner.  At times
he was evasive.  There
were a number of inconsistencies in his evidence
particularly in relation to the topics of receipt of the brochure from the
Consumer
Claims Tribunal, the clearing of the shed, whether he sent one or two
letters to the defendant, advertising and whether he was permitted
to make a
telephone call during the course of the Consumer Claims Tribunal proceedings.
I shall refer to these topics in more detail
shortly.  
<P>

6	The plaintiff had received a claim form which he read.  It is clear on the
form that the defendant stated that the value of the
claim was $14,000.  An
example of the plaintiff's evasiveness during cross examination is as
follows.
<P>

7	At t 6.25-55:
<P>

<b>"Q.	And you were aware it was a large claim he was bringing against
you?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	I had no idea how he arrived at this figure."</b>
<P>

8	At t 8.25:
<P>

<b>"Q.	You were aware before you went to the tribunal hearing that you had to
be ready to meet a claim for $14,000?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	No.  The amount was in dispute.</b>
<P>

<b>Q.	You read the claim form and you saw Mr Doherty was claiming $14,000 for
many items which he said were missing from the storage
unit and you said were
not?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	That's correct."</b>
<P>

9	Later at t 13.25:
<P>

<b>"Q.	When you went to the hearing what did you think Mr Hancock was claiming
that would amount in value to $14,000?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	I had no idea, to be honest."</b>
<P>

10	Another example of the plaintiff's evasive answering of a question appears
at t 21.35-55 and t 22.5:
<P>

<b>"Q.	This affidavit was sworn in August 1998, wasn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	If it says so.</b>
<P>

<b>Q.	Some months after the hearing before the tribunal?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	Yes.</b>
<P>

<b>Q.	Would you look at p 9 now.  Here you give an account of what was said at
the hearing and you say, at par 26, the referee said `I
am disturbed by the
fact you did not advertise for Mr Hancock in the paper' and you say `The
licence agreement says I do not have
to advertise.'  The referee said, `The
legislation says you have to advertise.'  That conversation record (sic) in
that affidavit
is pure fantasy, isn't it?</b>
<P>

<b>A.	Which affidavit are we talking about now?"</b>
<P>

11	I turn to some of the inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence.  In
relation to the brochure, in his affidavit the plaintiff
made no mention of
receiving a brochure which accompanied a claim form together with a covering
letter.  In cross examination the
plaintiff conceded that he probably received
the brochure with the claim form.  He said that he recalled receiving a little
green
brochure.  In his answer to the next question he retreated from that
stance and said he did not recall receiving the brochure and
he did not know if
he received the brochure (t 5).  He then conceded that he may have read some of
the brochure.
<P>

12	In relation to the clearing of the shed, at the hearing before the Referee
the plaintiff stated "then I got someone in to clean
it out."  The defendant in
his statement tendered to the Referee recalled that during a conversation
between the plaintiff and himself
where he (defendant) asked for the location
of various items that were stored in the shed, the plaintiff replied that he
could not
tell the defendant, and he would have to ring the bloke who cleaned
the defendant's bay out.  This statement is also reflected in
the Referee's
notes and the Referee in his reasons when determining a just and equitable
amount of damages stated that the plaintiff
had no record whatsoever of the
goods he removed from the shed.  In the plaintiff's affidavit (sworn 3 August
1998) the plaintiff
stated that after he had cleaned out Unit No 74 he observed
that the items that were removed were of little or no value.  At the
hearing
before me under cross examination the plaintiff said that he engaged someone
"to assist him" (t 11.45).  In his affidavit
he stated that someone else did
start clearing the shed but he took the goods in the truck to the tip.  In
other words he was saying
to the court that he had knowledge as to the contents
of the shed.
<P>

13	In relation to advertising, the defendant told Ms Cowell that he had put
advertisements in the paper.  At the hearing before
the Referee the plaintiff
maintained that an advertisement had been placed in the local paper although he
had no details with him
to support his allegation.  During cross examination,
the plaintiff said that he was aware that he had to advertise (t 9.32).  The
plaintiff agreed he told the Referee that an advertisement was placed in the
local paper in about the end of August 1997 when 6 or
7 were placed on the same
day.  The defendant's version of what the plaintiff told the Referee is that
the plaintiff thought his
wife had advertised and she had a receipt somewhere.
The defendant does not recall the plaintiff responding to the Referee's
question
of when the plaintiff actually advertised.  During cross examination,
the plaintiff stated that he was unable to produce any advertisement
at the
Tribunal hearing as the defendant's name was not on the list (t 17).  He
admitted that he was aware that a subpoena had been
served on the newspaper and
they were unable to produce these advertisements (t 17-18).  Finally, the
plaintiff conceded that he
did not place an advertisement in the newspaper with
the defendant's name on it (t 18.7).
<P>

14	The plaintiff claims to have sent two letters to the defendant informing him
that his rent payments were in arrears and he intended
to dispose of the
contents.  At the hearing before the Referee, the plaintiff only produced one
letter.  At the hearing before me
he produced a second letter which was
apparently dated 3 August 1997.  It was suggested during cross examination that
he manufactured
this letter after the Tribunal hearing.  His explanation as to
why he did not produce the earlier letter purportedly sent in June
(which also
contains no addressee, address or date and was not received by the defendant)
to the Referee was because "it was in a
different section of the computer" (t
9-10).  The defendant did not receive either letter.  The plaintiff had further
difficulties
with his computer which meant he was unable to produce all of the
rent receipts in relation to the bay used by the defendant in the
storage shed.
According to the plaintiff, there had been a computer malfunction prior to
January and March 1997 and it was difficult
to check up on about 30,000 receipt
books (t 16).
<P>

15	With regard to the plaintiff's request to make a telephone call during the
hearing before the Referee, there is no evidence of
this request being made
either in the Referee's notes or the Referee's reasons.  Nor is there any
mention of such a request in the
plaintiff's affidavits.  The first mention of
this purported request was raised by the plaintiff during cross examination at
the
hearing before me.  He said that he had asked the Referee if he could make
a telephone call to his brother to confirm the prices
of tools and that this
request had been denied by the Referee.  The plaintiff was unable to explain
why he had not referred to this
incident in his affidavit.  The defendant gave
evidence that he did not recall the plaintiff requesting permission to make a
telephone
call.  Rather he did recall the plaintiff's mobile ringing during the
course of the hearing when the Referee asked the plaintiff
to turn it off or
leave the room.  I shall refer to this incident again later in this
judgment.
<P>

16	The defendant was asked only a few questions.  He appears to be mistaken on
one matter, namely whether or not his statement dated
12 October 1998 was
annexed to his claim form.  He said it was but conceded that he could be
mistaken  The claim form was lodged
on 23 February 1998 and it is more likely
the defendant filed this statement with the Consumer Claims Tribunal after he
lodged his
claim but prior to the hearing.  I accept the plaintiff did not see
a copy of this statement prior to the hearing.  This mistake
was a genuine
error by the defendant.  It was my view that the defendant was a truthful
witness.  His mistake did not cause me to
doubt the rest of his evidence.  His
evidence contained in his statement, affidavit and before the court was
consistent.  Both the
plaintiff and defendant gave conflicting evidence before
the Tribunal and this court.  The parties' credibility was in issue.  I
have
outlined some difficulties with the plaintiff's evidence above and I prefer the
defendant's evidence to that of the plaintiff.
<P>

17	The brief facts leading up to the hearing in the Consumer Claims Tribunal
are as follows.
<P>

(1)	That prior to 11 October 1997 the goods were removed from Unit 74 within
the storage shed complex as the defendant had fallen
into arrears with his
rental payments  Some of the goods were put on consignment in the second hand
store next door to the storage
shed complex.  Goods that were considered
worthless were taken to the tip.
<P>

(2)	On 11 October  1997 the defendant attempted to take possession of the goods
he had stored with the plaintiff.  Subsequently
some goods were returned to the
defendant.  However, the defendant alleged that some of the items, personal
possessions and papers
were not returned.  The plaintiff and defendant had a
conversation.  It is agreed that the defendant prepared a list of the missing
goods and later that day gave it to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff's evidence is
that the list contained only 5 or 6 items, whereas
the defendant's evidence is
that the list contained more than 6 items but less than the number that
appeared in a schedule that he
prepared for the hearing. (Ex 1 p 22b).  The
plaintiff's evidence is that he lost this list prior to the hearing.
<P>

(3)	The defendant lodged a complaint with the Department of Fair Trading at
Port Macquarie.  On 4 February 1998 the plaintiff had
a conversation with an
officer of that department who informed him that they had received a complaint
from Mr Hancock in relation
to the way in which he had dealt with some of the
goods belonging to Mr Hancock in a shed within the storage complex.  The
plaintiff
was informed that he had not dealt with the goods in accordance with
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uga1995179/" class="autolink_findacts">Uncollected Goods Act</a></b>.  The defendant replied that he had a written
agreement that specifically stated that he could do as he pleased.  The
conversation
ended when the officer requested the plaintiff fax a copy of the
Licence Agreement and that his supervisor would get back to the
plaintiff.
<P>

(4)	On 10 March 1998 the plaintiff telephoned Ms Cowell who was the office
manager.  Once again Ms Cowell informed the plaintiff
that there were strict
methods under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uga1995179/" class="autolink_findacts">Uncollected Goods Act</a></b> which required certain notices
and steps to be taken.  The plaintiff says that he told Ms Kerry Cowell that he
had sent notices and
queried how the defendant could claim $10,000 against him.
The plaintiff said that he had returned most of the goods to the defendant
and
the items that he did not have he threw out because they were rubbish and of no
value and that if they had been of any value
he would have sold them and
applied it to the outstanding rent.  According to the plaintiff Ms Cowell
replied "Well I am under an
obligation to tell Mr Hancock that he can lodge a
claim with the Consumer Claims Tribunal should he wish to do so".  The
plaintiff
replied "I'll defend any claim he makes because the goods that are
missing are not worth $10,000, they would be worth a couple of
hundred dollars
at the most".  
<P>

(5)	Ms Cowell's version of events is contained in a contemporaneous file note.
The note states that the plaintiff had rung and was
most upset about receiving
this claim.  He had tried to contact the defendant over monies the defendant
owed him but he had moved.
 The plaintiff had advertised in the paper and all.
Ms Cowell explained that if a person wished to lodge a claim that under the Act
the office had to take it.  The plaintiff said that the Act should be changed.
He was told he could contact his local member if he
wished to discuss changing
the Act.  Ms Cowell explained that the matter would be listed for hearing at
Port Macquarie and the onus
was on the defendant to prove the claim and it
would be the defendant's chance to provide evidence for his side.  He was told
to
bring all his documents in relation to the matter and that the hearing would
be either April or May.  The note concluded by saying
that the plaintiff had
calmed down by the end of the conversation.  The plaintiff admits that he was
told that he had to attend the
hearing.
<P>

(6)	On 23 February 1998 the defendant lodged a claim form with the Consumer
Claims Tribunal.  On 10 March 1998 the plaintiff received
a letter from the
Consumer Claims Tribunal enclosing a copy of the claim form.  In cross
examination the plaintiff was asked whether
or not he received the brochure
enclosed and the covering letter.  The covering letter referred to the claim
and  attached a copy
of it.  Also enclosed was a brochure entitled "Information
about Consumer Claims Tribunals and Building Disputes Tribunals".  The
letter
covering referred to the brochure which explains the operation of the
Tribunals.  The covering letter also advised the plaintiff
that the matter
would be listed for hearing as soon as a date became available.  At the foot of
the document a note appears (in bold
letters) marked "<b>*IMPORTANT*</b>".
Underneath the plaintiff is directed to read the brochure enclosed.  This
brochure contained advice as to whether or not a party
can have an interpreter
or a lawyer present, what happens if a party cannot attend a hearing and also
explains what the Tribunal
does.  There is paragraph headed "What Happens at
the Hearing?" which states as follows:
<P>

<b>"*	You must present your own case.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	You bring any documents such as contracts, quotes, receipts, drawings,
plans, cheque books or letters and any other information
or material you think
will help you prove your case (Photographs are often very helpful).</b>
<P>

<b>  *	If you bring documents etc. to a hearing, please bring a copy to be
retained as part of the Tribunal record.  Otherwise originals
MAY be retained
by the Tribunal.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	If you have other evidence, e.g. the opinion of a relevant expert or
witness, they must give evidence on affidavit or statutory
declaration or
attend the Hearing and give evidence under oath.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	The hearing is informal and is headed by a Referee.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	At the hearing if you think you are at a disadvantage you can ask the
Referee if someone can speak for you.</b>
<P>

<b>	This is only allowed in certain circumstances.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	The Referee encourages each side to settle the problem.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	If you have not settled your problems the Referee listens to each
side.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	The person who made the claim goes first and tells their side and gives
their evidence.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	The other person then answers the claim and tells their side and gives
their evidence.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	If you still cannot reach an agreement yourself, the Referee makes an
order that is fair to each side.</b>
<P>

<b>  *	The Tribunal's orders are final.</b>
<P>

<b>	You must obey the Tribunal's order."</b>
<P>

(7)	As previously stated, the plaintiff initially gave evidence under cross
examination that he had probably read the brochure and
then after further
questions said that he could not recall.  However, he does not deny that he
would have received this brochure
through the mail with the letter.  He
conceded that he may have read the brochure.  
<P>

(8)	It is more likely than not that the plaintiff knew that he had read the
brochure.  The plaintiff gave evidence that he knew
he had to turn up at the
hearing and had to prepare his claim and get his matter ready for the hearing.
He admitted that he was aware
that the defendant was claiming $14,000 but he
was not aware of how that amount was made up.  The plaintiff agreed that the
document
contained some helpful suggestions such as bringing documents and
witnesses to the hearing.  He said that he was aware that Ms Talbot
the owner
of the second hand goods store next door was an important witness.
<P>

(9)	On 7 April 1998 the plaintiff received a letter from the Consumer Claims
Tribunal advising him that the claim had been listed
for hearing in Port
Macquarie on 22 April 1998 at 9.30 am for one hour.  At the foot of the
document it stated:
<P>

	<b>"YOU ARE NOTIFIED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF EITHER PARTY THE CASE MAY BE
DETERMINED BY THE TRIBUNAL AND AN ORDER MADE ON THE EVIDENCE
AVAILABLE.  EVEN
IF YOU HAVE ATTENDED AN INITIAL HEARING, IT IS ALWAYS IN YOUR INTERESTS TO
ATTEND ANY SUBSEQUENT RELISTING OF A
CLAIM."</b>
<P>

(10)	At the hearing on 22 April 1998, the plaintiff, defendant and Mr Morrison
attended the hearing before the Referee.  It is common
ground that on 22 April
1998 the matter took 2 hours having previously been estimated to take 1 hour.
The Referee introduced himself
to both the parties and informed the parties
that his decision was final and he was going to ask them to swear an oath.  Mr
Hancock
was accompanied by Mr Morrison who later gave evidence.  It is also
common ground that the Referee spoke generally about the case
in the context of
the claim form.  The Referee invited the defendant to put his case.  The
defendant handed to the Referee a statement
of a list of goods that he said had
not been recovered out of the shed.  This list contains 32 items.  Although the
plaintiff had
not previously received a copy of this list he was given an
opportunity to examine it.  He commented upon items that were in the
storage
unit and what they were worth (t 20).  It is the defendant's version of events
that this list contained most of the items
that he had earlier written on the
back of an envelope and given to the plaintiff.  As previously stated, the
plaintiff lost this
list.
<P>

(11)	The defendant handed to the Referee numerous quotes from a hardware store
which refer to the replacement value of the goods
he alleged were not returned
to him.  A copy of these quotes was provided to the plaintiff.  However
although he denied ever seeing
only one of them from Hulberts Hardware.  The
plaintiff agreed that he was given the opportunity to go through the list and
comment
on the prices.  He took 5 to 10 minutes to go through the list.
According to the plaintiff he told the Referee the prices were not
fair and he
commented on what they were worth.  The plaintiff stated that he knew that a
mechanic tool kit was not worth $3,500 (t
20).
<P>

(12)	After the defendant had put his case the Referee invited the plaintiff to
put his case.  The plaintiff handed to the Referee
a copy of the licence
agreement.  The Referee raised the issue of advertising and what had happened
to the goods that were removed.
 The plaintiff defended the proceedings on two
bases, namely that para G of the contract gave him permission to dispose of the
goods
in the manner he saw fit and secondly that with the exception of 6 items,
all the goods that were in the shed were returned.  It
is curious that the
plaintiff used the defence that he was entitled to dispose of the goods
pursuant to the contract when he had
previously been advised on two occasions
that he was not entitled to do so due to the provisions of the <b>Unclaimed
Goods Act</b> which were applicable.  Even though the plaintiff asserted that
he was entitled to dispose of the goods, his alternative position
was that he
sent a reminder notice about one month earlier.  This notice is undated and the
defendant's name and address do not appear
on the letter and he received no
reply.  A copy of this letter was produced.  He also advertised in the local
paper but no copy of
the advertisement was produced.
<P>

The defendant told the Referee that he could not produce records to the Referee
at the hearing of what was sent to the second hand
shop although he did not
believe any were sold.  According to the defendant at the end of the hearing
the plaintiff told the Referee
that he had a brief look in the shed and thought
it contained mainly junk but no reference to this appears in the Referee's
notes
 He affirmed that another person moved the items out.
<P>

(13)	The Referee once again explored whether the parties were able to settle
the proceedings.  When settlement negotiations failed
the Referee adjourned for
20 minutes to consider his decision.  He called the parties in and read out his
decision to them.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

18	The plaintiff relied on s 12(2)(b)(ii) of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal
Act</b> 1987 which gives this court the jurisdiction to grant relief in
relation to the hearing or determination of the claim if a party
has been
denied natural justice.  No appeal lies to this court where errors of fact or
law have occurred.  
<P>

19	At the outset, it is helpful to set out some of the provisions of the
<b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987.  The Tribunal is not constrained by
the rigour of the court room.  In a sense, its function is to mete out rough
justice or
at least a less than perfect form of justice in an economical way
appropriate for disputes within the limits of its jurisdiction.
 Evidence
before the Tribunal must be relevant to the determination of a claim (s 23(1)
of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987 as amended) and must be given
on oath or statutory declaration (s 23(2) - s 23(3)) but the Tribunal is not
bound by the rules
or practice of evidence and the Tribunal may inform itself
on any matter in such manner as it considers appropriate (s 23(4) - see
also s
29(4)).  The Tribunal must conform to the rules of natural justice but, broadly
speaking, has control of and responsibility
for its own procedures (s 17(1)).
Its business is conducted in private (s 22(1)).  There is no requirement that
Referees constituting
the Tribunal be legally qualified.  The orders of the
Tribunal must, in its opinion, be "fair and equitable" (s 31(1)).  The tribunal
has no power to award costs (s 28).  Pursuant to s 29 of the <b>Act</b> the
Tribunal is obliged to use its best endeavours to bring the parties to a
settlement before making any order.

Limited v The Registrar CCT &amp; Ors</u></b> (NSWSC, Graham AJ, 16 December
1997, unreported).
<P>

21	In <b><u>Hutley</u></b>, Rolfe J referred to the often quoted and if I may
respectfully say so the helpful comments of Hunt J (as he then was) in
<b><u>Singer v Statutory and Other Officers Remuneration Tribunal</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 633</a> and those of Simpson J in <b><u>Archcom Pty Limited v
Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Ors</u></b> (NSWSC, 29 September 1995,
unreported) which deal with the nature of the proceedings in the Consumer
Claims Tribunal.  
<P>

22	The Tribunal has been established to deal with small claims in a relatively
informal and expeditious manner.  As Hunt J said
in <b><u>Singer</u></b> at p
635:
<P>

	<b>"The Consumer Tribunal Act 1974 has set up a system for the speedy and
inexpensive disposal of certain claims, limited in amount,
arising out of
contracts for the supply of goods or the provision of services by a person
carrying on (or holding himself out as
carrying on) the business of supplying
such goods or providing such services.  The tribunal hearing such claims is
constituted by
a referee, who need not have (and who in many cases does not
have) legal qualification."</b>
<P>

23	As Simpson J said in <b><u>Archcom</u></b> at p 12 after referring to the
remarks of Hunt J:
<P>

<u>	</u><b>"Those remarks were made in the context of the predecessor of the
Act, a 1974 Act by the same title, but they apply equally to the
Act.
Underpinning the Act is a policy of providing expeditious access to an
inexpensive and informal process for the resolution of
consumer disputes
involving relatively small amounts of money.  Speed and economy are to be
accompanied and (it is hoped) often achieved,
by informality."</b>
<P>

24	Her Honour continued, at pp 13-14:
<P>

	<b>"The intention of the legislature, in creating these tribunals as a forum
for the resolution of disputes involving relatively small
amounts of money was
the achievement of expeditious and inexpensive justice between the parties
while maintaining a proper regard
for, and protection of, the rights of the
parties to the dispute.  The difficulty, as I see it, lies in striking the
correct balance
between those two goals.  Speedy and inexpensive solutions may
be inimicable to the protection of rights.  There is no necessary
relationship
between the factual or legal complexity and the quantum of a claim but legal
rights and obligations remain at the heart
of the tribunal's jurisdiction.
Although a tribunal is enjoined to make such orders as will, in its opinion, be
fair and equitable
to all parties to the claim (s 31(1)), those orders must be
grounded in legal liability."</b>
<P>

25	Her Honour thus stressed the need for "justice" and the "protection of
rights".
<P>

26	In <b><u>Barnes</u></b>, a decision of the Commonwealth Industrial Court,
the central issue of the case was whether Mr Oliver had been since 22 January
1970
the duly appointed branch secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the
Australian  Workers Union.
<P>

27	Mr Oliver attended a meeting on 17 January 1970 when the vice president read
out a report which he (Oliver) had not previously
seen.  The scope, charges and
breadth of the matters set out in the report involved the consideration of
numerous aspects of branch
activities which extended over many years.  Mr
Oliver was not given a fair chance to deal with the charges.  A motion was
passed
that Mr Oliver be immediately removed as branch secretary.
<P>

28	Sweeney J stated (at p 390) that the question to be decided turned on the
construction of r 67 of the <b>Conciliation and Arbitration Act</b> 1904-1969.
His Honour referred to the words of Professor S A de Smith, <b>Judicial Review
of Administrative Act</b>, 2nd ed., pp 180-181 which are reproduced below. 
<P>

	<b>"Natural justice generally required that persons liable to be directly
affected by proposed administrative acts, decisions or proceedings
be given
adequate notice of what is proposed, so that they may be in a position:  (a) to
make representations on their own behalf;
 or (b) to appear at a hearing or
inquiry (if one is to be held);  and (c) effectively to prepare their own case
and to answer the
case (if any) they have to meet."</b>
<P>

29	His Honour held that the notice given to Mr Oliver by the reading of the
report was not adequate and it was no answer to say
that Mr Oliver did not seek
an adjournment.  Sweeney J held that a branch executive seeking to exercise a
power conferred by r 67
of the <b>Act</b> was obliged to give adequate notice
and proffer natural justice.  His Honour concluded that a party confronted as
Oliver was, after
long and silent preparation by his accusers, with a report
containing allegations and purported findings of neglect of his official
duty
extending over a long period, should not be placed in a position where,
although vigorously protesting his innocence, he can
finally be deprived of the
benefits of natural justice unless he demands an adjournment.
<P>

30	In <b><u>Kioa</u></b>  the High Court held that the duty to accord natural
justice is a duty to act fairly.  In the normal course, a party to judicial
proceedings (as are those in a tribunal) could expect to be apprised of the
nature of the case sought to be made against it, and
of the date and time fixed
for hearing such as to give it a reasonable opportunity to meet that case and
to advance its own.  These
statements are similar to those expressed by
Professor de Smith and referred to earlier.  Brennan J (as he then was) at p
628 stated:
<P>

	<b>"A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power
must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters
adverse to his
interest which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in
deciding upon its exercise."</b>
<P>

31	In relation to procedural fairness, Mason J stated in <b><u>Kioa</u></b>
that the law had now developed to a point where it may be accepted that there
is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of
according procedural
fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which affect the rights,
interests and legitimate expectations,
subject only to the clear manifestation
of a contrary statutory intention.  Procedural fairness is a notion of a
flexible obligation
to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted
to the circumstances of the particular case (pp 454 and 455).
<P>

32	In <b><u>Fletcher</u></b> the applicant taxpayers had claimed certain
deductions in respect of elaborate arrangements into which they had entered
respecting
certain annuities.  The respondent Commissioner had rejected their
claims for deductions and, subsequently, had disallowed their
objections in
respect of his decision to reject their claims.  The Administrative Appeals
Tribunal had confirmed the Commissioner's
disallowance of the taxpayers'
objections but in doing so the Tribunal had purported to exercise the
discretion conferred upon the
Commissioner by s 177F(1) of the <b>Income Tax
Assessment Act</b> 1936 (Cth).  The court held that the failure of the Tribunal
to give notice to the taxpayers of the possibility of a determination
under s
177F(1) in the circumstances constituted a denial of procedural fairness and
remitted the matter to the Tribunal for further
hearing.  I did not find this
case useful.
<P>

33	The most relevant case is that of Kearney J of the Supreme Court of the
Northern Territory in <b><u>Bayram &amp; Ors v Chris Benton</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/NTSC/1994/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] NTSC 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20117%20FLR%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 117
FLR 414.</a>  It was cited with approval by Rolfe J in <b><u>Hutley</u></b>.  In
<b><u>Bayram</u></b> the issue before His Honour was whether the appellants had
been denied natural justice in that they had not been afforded a reasonable
opportunity to present their case, in all the circumstances;  and that this
denial of natural justice meant that the Tribunal's decision
was wrong in law,
or, alternatively, established that the conduct of the proceedings was unfair
(p 417).  Kearney J referred to the
decision in <b><u>Sullivan v Department of
Transport</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2020%20ALR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 20 ALR 323</a> and quoted from a passage in the judgment
of Deane J at p 343, where His Honour said:
<P>

	<b>"A refusal to grant an adjournment can constitute a failure to give a party
to proceedings the opportunity of adequately presenting
his case.  If the
tribunal had, in the present matter, refused an application by the appellant
for an adjournment to enable him to
procure Dr Evans' attendance as a witness,
that refusal may well have constituted such a failure.  No such application for
an adjournment
was, however, made ...  The absence of any application for an
adjournment does not, however, necessarily conclude the issue adversely
to the
appellant.  The failure of a tribunal which is under a duty to act judicially
to adjourn a matter may, conceivably, constitute
a failure to allow a party the
opportunity of properly presenting his case even though the party in question
has not expressly sought
an adjournment (see <i>Priddle v Fisher &amp; Sons</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%201478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 WLR 1478</a> ...).  In this regard, however, it is important to remember
that the relevant duty of the tribunal is to ensure that a party is given
a
reasonable <i>opportunity</i>  to present his case.  Neither the Act nor the
common law imposes upon the tribunal the impossible task of ensuring that a
party
takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is
entitled."</b>
<P>

34	In <b><u>Hutley</u></b> the claimant before the Building Disputes Tribunal
indicated that he needed time to prepare a response to the Scott schedule and
was given a short break during a recess of about 30 minutes to review the list
and telephone his solicitor.  Upon returning to the
hearing room he indicated
he was unable to properly address the items raised without a visual inspection
of the site and opportunity
to engage an independent expert.  Rolfe J held that
the plaintiff had been denied natural justice when a referee refused an
adjournment
of a hearing when requested to do so, after the respondent at the
hearing handed to the referee a Scott schedule listing defects
and
rectification works of four pages in length and listing 47 items each
attributed with a probable cost.
<P>

35	The plaintiff has made a number of complaints concerning the hearing before
the Referee which he submitted amounted to a denial
of natural justice.  They
are, firstly that the Referee should have advised him of the availability of an
adjournment particularly
when he allegedly sought permission during the
proceedings to make a telephone call;  secondly he did not know what role Mr
Morrison
was to play at the hearing;  thirdly all paperwork and documents used
by the defendant in his submissions were typed on the letterhead
of Garrett
&amp; Walmsley, solicitors of Port Macquarie;  fourthly Mr Hancock did not
possess receipts for the original purchase
of the goods allegedly in the shed
and relied upon valuations for new goods;  fifthly the plaintiff did not bring
any witnesses to
the hearing because he did not think he needed these people at
the hearing; sixthly he was not given a copy of the list of goods
and their
values claimed by Mr Hancock and seventhly nor was he invited to review the
list prior to it being handed to the Referee.
 
<P>

36	In relation to the first complaint that the Referee should have advised him
of an adjournment, the plaintiff's evidence was that
he did not know that he
could request an adjournment.  However the plaintiff claimed for the first time
at the end of his cross examination
that he requested the Referee's permission
to make a telephone call.  The defendant denies that the plaintiff made this
request and
the Referee's notes and decision do not make any mention of it. I
am not satisfied that on the balance of probabilities this request
was made.
However, it does indicate that the plaintiff was aware that he could ask for an
adjournment at least for a few minutes.
 I do not accept the plaintiff's
evidence that he was unaware that he could ask for an adjournment.  As was
stated in <b><u>Sullivan</u></b>, the Referee had a duty to ensure that the
plaintiff was given a reasonable opportunity to present his case.  Even if the
plaintiff
had sought and obtained a short adjournment to confirm with his
brother that the prices referred to in the quotes from the hardware
store it
would have served little purpose as the plaintiff already knew they were
outrageous and went on to make submissions on this
topic.  The plaintiff had
previously received the claim form and a list of goods that were in the shed.
That list contained items
that had not been returned.  The list may not have
been as complete as the one handed to the Referee by the defendant at the
Tribunal
hearing.  The Referee does not have to ensure that the plaintiff took
the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is entitled.
 The Referee was
aware that the plaintiff had some documents to support his case.  The plaintiff
was able to give his version of
events and gave an alternative submission when
the plaintiff thought it expedient to do so.  In short, the plaintiff did not
draw
to the Referee's attention that he was unable to meet the defendant's
invoices.  There is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff
made such a
complaint to indicate he could not meet the defendant's case or that the
Referee would have been able to discern that
the plaintiff was not in a
position to meet the defendant's case.
<P>

37	In relation to the second complaint, that the plaintiff said he did not know
the role that Mr Morrison played, that would have
become evident during the
proceedings.  If he was unsure at the commencement of the proceedings he could
have asked the Referee.
 According to the plaintiff it was two on one and Mr
Morrison was bolstering Mr Hancock's argument despite the fact that the
comments
were in relation to issues that Mr Morrison could have known nothing
about.  Another complaint was that Mr Morrison was not asked
to wait outside
until he had been called into the room.  The rules of evidence do not apply at
a Tribunal hearing and proceedings
are informal.  However, during the course of
the tribunal proceedings it became apparent to the plaintiff that Mr Morrison
was appearing
in his role of witness.  Although he looked different in a suit
and tie, the plaintiff conceded that he recognised that it was Mr
Morrison who
went with the defendant to recover the goods from the storage shed on 11
October 1997.  A statement made by Mr Morrison
was tendered to the Referee and
Mr Morrison gave short evidence.  
<P>

38	The third complaint is that all the paperwork and documents the defendant
used in his submissions were typed on solicitors' letterhead.
 The plaintiff
submitted that the defendant should not have been allowed to use the
solicitor's submission because he knew that solicitors
were not allowed to be
involved in the hearing.  The defendant's evidence is that he may have had
documents with him at the tribunal
with solicitors' letterhead, but he did not
rely on these documents, nor were they his submissions.  None of the
correspondence on
the Consumer Claims Tribunal file is on solicitor's
letterhead.  In any event the defendant was entitled to seek the assistance of
solicitors in the preparation of his case and he availed himself of this
opportunity.
<P>

39	In relation to the fourth complaint namely that the defendant did not
produce receipts for the goods stored in the shed but rather
relied on
valuation of new goods, according to the defendant all documents of this nature
were in the storage shed.  They were disposed
of by the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff denied there were personal papers in the storage shed and thought
that the plaintiff's assertion
was "convenient".  I prefer the defendant's
evidence.  However it is more likely that some but not all of the original
receipts were
in the storage shed.  In any case, these valuations were
estimates that gave the Referee some indication as to the value of the goods
that had been stored in the shed.  It is clear from the Referee's notes and
decision that he had taken into consideration the sale
and replacement value.
He awarded less than half the amount claimed by the defendant.
<P>

40	In relation to the fifth and sixth complaints that he did not bring any
witnesses, when the plaintiff was asked in cross examination
whether he made a
decision not to call Ms Talbot at the hearing before the Referee he made a
telling statement.  He replied "I was
unaware that I was up against any other
witnesses."  That is the plaintiff made a tactical mistake and did not
anticipate that the
defendant would bring his witness.
<P>

41	The plaintiff submitted that he could have called the witnesses if he had
understood the nature of the hearing but the form that
was sent to him gave no
indication of whether or not he needed witnesses.  He had previously been
involved in a court hearing and
at the hearing the names of the witnesses had
to be disclosed otherwise they could not attend.  As the plaintiff had not been
advised
by Mr Hancock or the Tribunal of any of Mr Hancock's witnesses he
assumed that Mr Hancock had none and did not bring any of his own.
 He could
have called his brother and his father-in-law who came into the shed before he
cleared it out to advise him if there was
anything of any value in respect of
the car parts that were there;  Mrs Joan Talbot, who runs the second hand shop
as she was there
when things were cleared out and she advised him as to whether
anything was of any value to sell.  Those items that were of value
were given
to Mrs Talbot to sell, and were subsequently returned to Mr Hancock as they had
not been sold and the person who helped
him clear the shed out.  In this
regard, the defendant has filed affidavit evidence which deposes to the value
of the goods in storage.
 Ms Mulligan who assisted Mr Hancock when he placed
the goods in the storage shed has filed an affidavit and itemised the list of
goods that were placed in the storage shed in October 1996.  The parties agreed
that the evidence of Ms Talbot and Ms Mulligan are
in issue as they both attest
to the value of goods in the shed.
<P>

42	I do not accept that the plaintiff was unaware that he should have brought
witnesses to the hearing despite his evidence to the
contrary. Ms Cowell told
the plaintiff that it was his chance to produce evidence for his side at the
tribunal.  The plaintiff received
a brochure telling him "If you have other
evidence, eg., the opinion of a relevant expert or witness, they must give
evidence on
affidavit or statutory declaration or attend the hearing and give
evidence under oath."  The plaintiff conceded that he probably
read this
brochure.  Therefore he would have been aware that if he had any witnesses he
should have brought them to the tribunal
but chose not to do so.
<P>

43	In relation to the plaintiff's sixth complaint that he was not give a copy
of the list of goods, in evidence he said that he
had the opportunity to look
at it and make comments on it and he did so.
<P>

44	The plaintiff was however given a copy of the invoices regarding the tools
and it had a very broad descriptions regarding the
various items.  The
plaintiff firstly indicated his position to the Referee that the invoices were
irrelevant as these goods were
not in the shed.  He also admitted that he
commented that the prices were not fair and commented on what they were worth.
He spent
5 to 10 minutes in the following manner examining the quotes.  In
relation to the list, I accept that the defendant had previously
furnished a
list on the back of an envelope which contained most of the items that appeared
in the typed list.  The plaintiff lost
the original list.
<P>

45	It is my view that the plaintiff chose to present his case that the contract
stipulated that he could dispose of the goods, he
attempted to contact the
defendant about the arrears and inform the defendant of his intention to
dispose of the goods, he advertised
before disposal and the goods in the shed
were mostly junk.  He got all but 6 items back from the second hand goods shop
and what
was not returned was worthless.  The plaintiff elected not to properly
prepare for the hearing and is now seeking a second chance.
 Taking all of the
plaintiff's complaints into account, it is my view that the plaintiff appeared
at the hearing, had the opportunity
to make representations on his own behalf
and to prepare his case and to answer the case he had to meet.  The onus was on
the plaintiff
to show that there had been denial of natural justice and he had
not done so.  The Referee ensured that the plaintiff was given a
reasonable
opportunity to meet the defendant's case.  As the plaintiff adopted the
position that the goods in the shed were junk
and alternatively submitted that
the goods were not worth as much as quoted in the invoices and made comment as
to how much they
were worth the Referee was not obliged to afford the plaintiff
an opportunity to ask for an adjournment.  In any event, the Referee
substantially reduced the amount claimed by the defendant and allowed less than
half the amount he claimed.
<P>

46	The plaintiff submitted that the Referee could have treated the hearing on
22 April 1998 as an initial hearing and adjourned
the hearing to another day.
Claims in the Consumer Claims Tribunal are to be dealt with in a speedy and
inexpensive way. The Referee
would not have had any reason to believe that the
plaintiff was at a disadvantage such that he required an adjournment.  It would
seem that unless a case is unduly complex, an initial hearing would be avoided
as it would add to the cost and duration of the dispute.
<P>

47	I dismiss the summons.  Costs should follow the event.  The plaintiff is to
pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

48	The court orders that:
<P>

(1)	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.
