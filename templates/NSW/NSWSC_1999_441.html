<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (On objection by counsel for the Defendant to certain questions in
re-examination - T1463)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  At a point in the re-examination of Mr Potter principally
dealing with the various components of exhibit G, the question,
in short form,
has been asked:  in the light of the experience gained in investigating D1 to
D6, how long does Mr Potter think it
will take to carry out the investigations
in relation to D18 to D25?
<P>

2	The length of time of any adjournment for the purpose of investigating or
preparing the plaintiff's case in relation to any allowed
amendment will, no
doubt, be the subject of submissions.  
<P>

3	I appreciate that between the time Mr Potter commenced his evidence and was
re-called to continue it and today, there have been
developments constituted,
obviously enough, by both his cross-examination and the admission into evidence
of exhibit 12.  
<P>

4	Mr Potter, in relation to one component (the City Plaza Hotel), was allowed
to give an estimate of six months.  I do not question,
for one moment, Mr
Potter's capacity to answer the question.  The defendant however is put in an
awkward position in terms of that
answer being tested, it not having discretely
been raised in chief or otherwise than I have allowed it.  I propose to allow
the subject
matter of the question to be freely considered during submissions
based on all the evidence I have received, but I disallow the question.
<P>
