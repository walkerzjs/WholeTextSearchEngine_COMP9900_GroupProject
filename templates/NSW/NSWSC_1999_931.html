Revised  15 September 1999
<P>

<b>50121/98 - SARWAT McGUID TRADING AS ABS GULF  v  OFFICE DE COMMERCIALISATION
ET D'EXPORTATION &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  There is before the Court a notice of motion
filed on 6 April 1999 pursuant to which the first defendant, Office
De
Commercialisation Et D' Exportation ["OCE"], seeks for the proceedings to be
permanently stayed.
<P>

2   	The parties to the proceedings are Sarwat McGuid trading as
ABS Gulf ["Gulf"], OCE, National Australia Bank Limited ["the Bank]
as second
defendant and Export Finance Insurance Corporation ["EFIC"] as third
defendant.
<P>

3   	The further amended summons was filed on 12 July 1999.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff is a resident of New South Wales trading from
premises at 12 Lily Street, Croydon Park, and is a Cost Accountant
and Licensed
Meat and Livestock Exporter.  The first defendant is an entity formed and
existing under the laws of the Kingdom of
Morocco.  The Bank is an Australian
corporation.  EFIC is an Australian corporation.
<P>

5   	The amended summons identifies the claims pursued against
OCE, against the Bank and EFIC.
<P>

6   	In so far as the plaintiff's proceedings concern its claims
against OCE, the notice of contentions makes fairly plain that
the dispute is
essentially contractually based.  There is, however, also a representational
case and an unjust enrichment case.
<P>

7   	The dispute arises in relation to the April 1998 issue by
OCE of a request for tenders to supply frozen bovine meat as specified.
<P>

8   	Following a tender submitted by Gulf, Gulf and OCE are
alleged to have agreed that Gulf would supply meat to OCE on particular
terms
and conditions recorded in a document accepted by the parties as having been
signed by them in Casablanca on or about 22 May
1998.  I understand there to be
no contention but that following further negotiations between Gulf and OCE, the
terms and conditions
were added to and varied and agreed as recorded in a
document signed by the parties, this time in Sydney, on or about 11 June
1998.
<P>

9   	It is common ground that the contract provided that Gulf
would deliver two thousand metric tonnes of meat at a price of 1,970
per metric
tonne in store to Agadir in Morocco.
<P>

10   	Article IV of the contract provided that payment would be
in US dollars by irrevocable and confirmed letter of credit opened
by the buyer
in favour of the seller in sufficient time to allow the delivery schedule
stipulated in the contract to be met by the
seller.  Apparently it is common
ground that on or about 10 June 1998, OCE through its agent Banque Marocaine Du
Commerce Exterieur,
Casablanca, ["BMCE"], purported to issue a letter of credit
complying with its obligations under the contract.
<P>

11   	Gulf's claim is that the letter of credit did not comply
with the contract for several reasons specified in para 9 of the
notice of
contentions, including that it was unconfirmed and so drawn that no bank was
likely to confirm it according to banking
practices and usages.
<P>

12   	Gulf alleges that it required OCE to open a confirmable
letter of credit in conformity with the contract and that thereafter,
on or
about 22 June 1998, OCE through its agent BMCE purported to issue a further
letter of credit pursuant to the contract.  The
further letter of credit is
said by Gulf to have also been in breach of the contract for the same reasons
as were set out in relation
to the earlier letter of credit.
<P>

13   	Gulf's case is that, despite further communications from
the plaintiff and several further amendments to the proffered letter
of credit,
OCE failed, neglected or refused to open a confirmable or confirmed letter of
credit which complied with the contract.
<P>

14   	Gulf therefore alleges that OCE had breached and
repudiated the contract thereby discharging Gulf from its obligation to
perform.
 In mitigation of its damages, Gulf asserts that it declined to ship
any meat to Morocco.
<P>

15   	Para 15 of the contentions then alleges the plaintiff's
damage in detail, including lost opportunity to make profits in performing
the
contract and other damages.
<P>

16   	The above description from paras 1 to 15 inclusive of the
notice of contentions may broadly be regarded as the first of Gulf's
counts
against OCE by way of breach and repudiation of contract.
<P>

17   	Clearly enough the issues which arise under that count are
contractual issues which, to my mind, squarely arise out of the
terms of the
supply agreement, by which description I shall refer to the 22 May 1998 and 11
June 1998 agreement earlier referred
to.
<P>

18   	Paras 16 through to 25 inclusive of the contentions then
allege matters going to the plaintiff's conduct by way, on the plaintiff's
allegations, of its, at the request of OCE, having procured BMCE to provide to
OCE a surety in the sum of $US120,000 by banker's
letter - the description of
this agreement in para 16 of the notice of contentions being "the surety
agreement".
<P>

19   	It is unnecessary in this judgment to set out the
particulars to para 16 which are self-explanatory.
<P>

20   	Paras 17, 18 and 19 of the contentions then allege a
number of implied terms of the so-called surety agreement imposing, it
is
suggested, obligations upon OCE.
<P>

21   	Para 20 of the contentions then alleges OCE's breaches of
implied terms of the surety agreement.
<P>

22   	Para 21 of the contentions asserts that OCE's failure to
provide the letter of credit "discharged the plaintiff from any obligation
to
further perform the supply contract on its behalf as a matter of common law or
by reason of the operation of paragraph 577 of
the Moroccan Civil Code".
<P>

23   	Para 22 of the contentions asserts that OCE's failure to
provide the letter of credit was a repudiatory breach of the supply
contract by
OCE which Gulf accepted by not shipping or delivering the goods the subject to
the contract.
<P>

24   	Para 23 of the contention seems to me to be particularly
important.  It alleges:
<P>

<i>"The repudiation and acceptance of repudiation of the supply agreement
brought the surety agreement to an end as to all the rights
and liabilities
under it".</i>
<P>

25   	Plainly enough the plaintiff seeks in that paragraph to
tie to the extancy of the surety agreement, the questions going to
the
termination or alleged termination following repudiation and acceptance of
repudiation, of the supply agreement.
<P>

26   	Paras 24 and 25 of the contentions do not require to be
repeated.
<P>

27   	Paras 26 through to 28 inclusive of the contentions then
deal with the plaintiff's allegations of wrongful claims by OCE from
BMCE
allegedly made in breach of the surety agreement.  It is again unnecessary to
repeat those paragraphs which are self-explanatory.
<P>

28   	Para 29A is a money had and received count dealing again
with the case as between plaintiff and first defendant.
<P>

29   	The particulars to Para 29B commence detail of the
misrepresentation case.  It broadly pleads that the benefit of the surety
contract was obtained by OCE upon representations that OCE presently intended
to perform the contractual obligations imposed on it
by the supply contract
according to its terms and in particular to provide a confirmable irrevocable
letter of credit for the amount
of the purchase price.  The representations are
said to have been made either with reckless indifference to truth or falsity,
or
negligently.  In the alternative allegations are made in relation to
representations as to future performance.
<P>

30   	Para 30 is the unjust enrichment count in relation to the
first defendant and it is self-explanatory.
<P>

31   	The claims made against the Bank are to be found in the
contentions paras 31 to 34 inclusive.  They relate to the provision
by Gulf
through the Bank by way of stand-by letter of credit in favour of BMCE in the
sum of $US120,000 of the bank security required
by the contract in favour of
OCE.  The claim here is that in breach of contract and without valid claim of
right, OCE on or about
13 October caused the claim to be made on the Bank for
it to make payment of the bank security to BMCE.
<P>

32   	It is common ground that in earlier interlocutory steps in
these proceedings injunctive relief was granted restraining the
Bank from
making such payment of the bank security.  My understanding is that that
injunctive relief continues until further order.
<P>

33   	The claim made against the third defendant is pleaded in
paras 35 to 39 of the contentions.  The plaintiff asserts that it
entered into
what is known as an `unfair call policy', namely a contract of insurance with
EFIC to indemnify 95 per cent of its loss
arising from a call being made for
payment of the performance bond.  The first defendant is said to have made a
call on the performance
bond which is said to have been an `unfair call' within
the meaning of the policy.  The claim is that by reason of the unfair call
the
plaintiff has suffered loss in that it is liable to indemnify the Bank in
respect of any sum it may be liable to pay to BMCE
in consequence of the call.
It is common ground that EFIC has failed or refused to indemnify Gulf pursuant
to the unfair call policy.
 The claims against the third defendant are then
pursued in respect of the plaintiff's alleged contractual rights against the
third
defendant.
<P>

34   	There are broadly three areas or substantive issues or
groups of issues which have been the subject of submissions from the
parties on
the stay application.
<P>

35   	The first deals with the proper construction of article VI
of the supply agreement and the question of whether or not, upon
the proper
construction of that article, the contract conferred exclusive jurisdiction
upon the courts of Casablanca in respect of
disputes.
<P>

36   	The second concerns what may be referred to as the reach
of article VI.  In short, does article VI extend to cover disputes
which the
supply contract "called up";  does article VI extend to those contractual
instruments brought into existence pursuant to
obligations said to have been
imposed upon Gulf or alternatively OCE, by reason of the terms of the supply
agreement or by reason
of terms implicit as between the plaintiff and the first
defendant?
<P>

37   	The third issue goes to the discretionary considerations
which it is common ground are to be taken into account by the Court
in
determining the fate of the notice of motion.
<P>

38   	It seems convenient to deal with the three issues seriatim
although from time to time factors relevant to each of the issues
carry over
with some effect to other of the issues.
<P>

39   	I turn first then to the proper construction of article
VI.
<P>

40   	The contract entered into by Gulf and OCE as I have said
was a written contract for the supply of meat to Morocco.  It was,
it is common
ground, entered into in Casablanca on 22 May 1998 and is written in French.
OCE submits that the contract contains a
clause which in the event of any
dispute confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the courts of Casablanca.
<P>

41   	The second of the documents which I have referred to, that
dated 11 June 1998, is a document by which the parties made further
provision
in relation to specifications for quality, delivery and hygiene of the meat.
It is common ground that this document does
not refer to dispute resolution,
jurisdiction, governing law of the contract or the competence of the courts of
Morocco or Australia.
<P>

42   	A question has been raised in the submissions of counsel
and in the affidavits and statements read on the hearing of the stay
application as to the proper translation of the relevant provision in the 22
May 1998 document.  That document provides as follows:-
<P>

<i>`. . . tout differend decoulant du present contrat sera tranche a l'amiable
et, a defaut, par les Tribunaux de CASABLANCA	dont les
deux parties
reconnaissent la competence pour le reglement de tous les litiges dans
l'application des dispositions du present contrat.'</i>
<P>

43   	During the course of the application for interlocutory
relief in the proceedings an affidavit was read made by Mr McGuid on
17
September 1998.  That affidavit annexed as annexure D what was said to be a
true translation from the French into the English
language of the 22 May 1998
document.  That translation was by Mr R J M Colinard described as "translator
accredited with NAATI to
translate from the French language into the English
language".
<P>

44   	Relevantly the translation of articles V and VI was as
follows:
<P>

<i>"Article V:  Security.</i>
<P>

<i>The seller undertakes to deliver to OCE as a warranty of performance, a bank
security issued by a Moroccan Bank and amounting to 3
per cent of the value of
the present contract, that is to say $US120,000 which will be refunded him 30
days after total and complete
delivery of the goods to Agadir.</i>
<P>

<i>Article VI:  Dispute.</i>
<P>

<i>Any dispute relating to the present contract will be resolved amicably and,
if not, by the courts in Casablanca, the jurisdiction
of which is acknowledged
by both parties, for the resolution of all disputes regarding the performance
of the stipulations of the
present contract".</i>
<P>

45   	In an affidavit then made on 6 April 1999 by Mr Brian
Hillman, solicitor for OCE, Mr Hillman annexed as annexure D a translation
which he had had effected by a qualified interpreter and again being a
translation, so it was alleged, of the relevant provisions
of the supply
agreement.  It is unnecessary to return to the translations of article V
because they were not in issue and the translation
taken from Mr McGuid's
affidavit and above set out may be accepted as the translation which the
parties are content be treated as
correct.
<P>

46   	Mr Hillman, however, as annexure D to his affidavit of 6
April 1999 annexed a translation by Ms Narelle Fletcher described
as `NAATI
Level 3 accredited translator'.  This translation of article VI read as
follows:
<P>

<i>"Article VI:  Dispute.</i>
<P>

<i>Any dispute ensuing from the present contract will be settled amicably.
Failing this, it will be settled by the courts of Casablanca
whose competence
is recognised by the two parties for settling all litigations in applying the
provisions of the present contract".</i>
<P>

47   	Mr Hillman's affidavit was then followed by an affidavit
this time made by Mr Colinard on 19 April 1999.  Mr Colinard there
deposes that
he is a solicitor practising under the style Colinard &amp; Co Solicitors and
has the carriage of the proceedings on
behalf of the plaintiff.  In paras 14 to
23 of Mr Colinard's 19 April 1999 affidavit he refers to the affidavit of Mr
Hillman and
treats with his further consideration of the meanings of a number
of the words used in the 22 May 1998 contract.  
<P>

<i>'14.	I have observed that there is a difference in the translation of
Article VI of the contract dated 22 May 1998 in the French language
annexed as
Annexure "C" of the Affidavit of the Plaintiff sworn on 17 September 1998 and
which is Annexure "B" to the Affidavit of
Brian Hillman, solicitors for the
First Defendant sworn on 6 April 1999.  I revisited the translation in order to
determine what
is the most accurate translation of that Article into the
English language.</i>
<P>

<i>15.	I refer to the affidavit sworn on 17 September 1998 of the Plaintiff and
to Annexure "D" thereof.  Article VI was translated as
follows by me:</i>
<P>

<i>	"ARTICLE VI:  DISPUTE.</i>
<P>

<i>	"Any dispute, relating to the present contract will be resolved amicably
and, if not, by the Courts in CASABLANCA, the jurisdiction
of which is
acknowledged by both parties, for the resolution of all disputes, regarding the
performance of the stipulations of the
present contract."</i>
<P>

<i>16.	I refer to the Affidavit of Mr Brian Hillman, solicitor for the First
Defendant sworn on 6 April 1999, and to Annexure "D" thereof.
 Article VI was
translated as follows by Narelle Fletcher:</i>
<P>

<i>	"ARTICLE VI:  DISPUTE</i>
<P>

<i>	"Any dispute ensuing from the present contract will be settled amicably.
Failing this, it will be settled by the Courts of CASABLANCA
whose competence
is recognised by the two parties for settling all litigations in applying the
provisions of the present contract".</i>
<P>

<i>17.	I have considered further the meanings of the French words "sera",
"competence" and "litige" in the present context and in the
following French
dictionaries:</i>
<P>

<i>1.  Dictionnaire National de la Langue Francaise by M. Bescherelle snr. 1857
Edition;</i>
<P>

<i>2.  Nouveau Dictionnaire Encyclopedique Larousse by Claude Auge, 1910
Edition;</i>
<P>

<i>3.  Dictonnaire Alphabetique et Analogique de la Langue Francaise by Paul
Robert, 1972 Edition;</i>
<P>

<i>4.  Harrap's New Standard French and English Dictionary by J.E. Manson 1980
Edition;</i>
<P>

<i>18.	I have noted the slow evolution of the word "litige" which in 1857 was
considered technically to mean litigation and popularly
to mean any dispute
through 1910 where "litige" meant a justiciable dispute but generally
understood to be a dispute to 1972 where
the meaning appears to mean dispute
generally, some of which are justiciable and others not.</i>
<P>

<i>19.	The meaning of "competence" in all authorities seems to refer to
"jurisdiction", "aptitude", "attributes" and "capacity" and "power".</i>
<P>

<i>20.	The word "jurisdiction" would seem too of narrow and legalistic a
translation of "competence".  The "word" "capacity" in my opinion
encompasses
all the various connotations of the word "competence".</i>
<P>

<i>21.	The word "sera" is the future third person singular of the verb "etre"
("to be" i.e. "Will be" in English).  "Sera" is a reference
to a future time
and does not indicate in addition to a future time, a compulsion or an
obligation.  If a compulsion mandatorily
is intended the words "devra etre"
("must be") should have been used, which indicate both an obligation from the
verb "devoir" ("to
have a duty to" i.e. "must") and "etre" (to be) which taken
together give the meaning of "must be".  The verb "sera" is stated once
and
governs both the possibility of resolving the dispute amicably and on failing
this before the Courts in Casablanca.  The capacity
of which Courts to hear the
dispute or to resolve the dispute is acknowledged.</i>
<P>

<i>22.	I am accredited by the national Accreditation Authority for Translators
and Interpreters ("NAATI") as a translator from French
into English at and have
been since 1989.  French is my native tongue and I use it daily both socially
and professionally with other
French speakers.</i>
<P>

<i>23.	In my opinion, the most accurate translation of Article VI from the
French language into English taking into consideration the
text referred to and
having considered the translation given by Narelle Fletcher, is as
follows:</i>
<P>

<i>"Any dispute flowing from the present contract will be resolved amicably and
failing this by the Courts in Casablanca, the capacity
of which is acknowledged
by both parties, for the resolution of all disputes, regarding the performance
of the provisions of the
present contract.".</i>
<P>

48   	OCE has submitted that if it is necessary to determine as
between the various translations which is the correct translation,
the Court
should prefer either the first translation of Mr Colinard or the translation of
Ms Fletcher.  OCE submits that Mr Colinard
is far from an impartial expert
witness as not only is he the plaintiff's solicitor but he is also said to be a
material witness
of fact and appears as a principal in events deposed to in a
number of paragraphs of Mr McGuid's affidavit of 17 September 1998 and
in Mr
McGuid's second affidavit of 14 October 1998.  Mr Colinard acknowledges that he
may be called as a witness of fact.
<P>

49   	Counsel have referred the Court to a number of authorities
dealing with the construction of exclusive jurisdiction clauses
including, of
recency, the judgment of Giles CJ Commercial Division in <i>FAI General
Insurance v Ocean Marine</i><b> </b><i>Mutual</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 117</a> and the
decision of Rolfe J in <i>Gem Plastics Pty</i><b> </b><i>Limited v Satrex
Maritime Pty Limited</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 9 June
1995).  The two clauses considered in those cases were "This reinsurance is
subject to English jurisdiction" and "This insurance is subject to South
African jurisdiction".  In each case the clauses were held
to amount to
exclusive jurisdiction clauses.
<P>

50   	I accept OCE's submissions that a number of matters are
clear from the authorities.  These are:
<P>

(a)	that no fixed rules can be applied in the determination of the construction
of clauses claimed to be exclusive jurisdiction
clauses;  instead every clause
must be construed in the light of its particular wording and the other terms in
the particular contract:
<P>

<i>"Whether a jurisdiction clause is an exclusive jurisdiction clause is a
question of construction of the particular contract, with
such regard to the
circumstances surrounding the entry into the contract as is permissible" -
</i>per Giles CJ Commercial Division<i> FAI v Ocean Marine </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20NSWLR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 NSWLR 117</a> at
126
<P>

(b)	a clause may be an exclusive jurisdiction clause even though the word
"exclusive" has not been used:
<P>

<i>"The word &#180;exclusive' is not determinative, and a clause may be held to
be an exclusive jurisdiction clause notwithstanding the
absence of that or a
similar word or phrase:  as was said in Continental Bank NA v AEAKOS Compagnia
Naviera SA (at 594), it would
be a surrender to formalism to require a
jurisdiction clause to provide in express terms that the chosen court is to be
the exclusive
forum" - per Giles CJ Commercial Division (1997) FAI v Ocean
Marine  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20NSWLR%20117" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 NSWLR 117</a> at 126</i>
<P>

(c)	the use of the word "shall" is capable of being "apposite to create the
language of obligation";
<P>

(d)	the fact that it would not have been necessary to agree that a country's
court should have non-exclusive jurisdiction means
that by expressly so
agreeing, the parties must be taken to have intended to agree that the country
would have exclusive jurisdiction:
<P>

<i>"If the courts of the relevant jurisdiction would have jurisdiction in the
absence of the clause, that may indicate that the clause
was intended to confer
exclusive jurisdiction . . .  Sohio Supply Co v Gatoil.  It will not always be
so, as the clause may have

<i>	`(c)	Although mutuality, in the sense that both parties agree to the
relevant jurisdiction, has been thought to point to exclusive
jurisdiction, I
have some difficulty seeing why that should be so.  Lack of mutuality is likely
to tell against exclusive jurisdiction
(Continental Bank NA v Aeakos Compania
Naviera SA), but mutuality is consistent with no more than submission to the
jurisdiction.
 However, when taken with other matters mutuality may assist in
finding a contractual intention that disputes shall be submitted
only to the
courts of the relevant jurisdiction:  British Aerospace Plc v Dee Howard Co;
Austrian Lloyd Steamship Co v Gresham Life

<P>

<i>(d)	Other language in the clause or the nature of the contract may point
towards that contractual intention, for example "under the
jurisdiction of the
English courts" and the assumed desire for certainty in Sohio Supply Co v

language as in Austrian Lloyd
Steamship Co v Gresham Life Assurance Society, Ltd, British Aerospace Plc v Dee

<i>The criterion familiar in relation to a stay of proceedings on forum non

forum (see
Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 538), is displaced or
modified when there is a submission to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts
of another country.  In such circumstances the starting point is that the
parties should be held to their
bargain, and while this Court retains its

of Appeal and the High Court, and in my opinion I should apply them.  They
are:</i>
<P>

<i>"(1)	Where plaintiffs sue in England in breach of an agreement to refer
disputes to a foreign court, and the defendants apply for
a stay, the English
court, assuming the claim to be otherwise within its jurisdiction, is not bound
to grant a stay but has a discretion
whether to do so or not.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	The discretion should be exercised by granting a stay unless strong
cause for not doing so is shown.</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	The burden of proving such a strong cause is on the plaintiffs.</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	In exercising its discretion the court should take into account all the
circumstances of the particular case."</i>
<P>

52   	Mr Cotman SC for the plaintiff has submitted that there
being no exclusive jurisdiction clause in the surety contract and
the surety
contract being, on his submissions, a compound arrangement involving domestic
Australian transactions, international transactions
and domestic Moroccan
transactions, there is no presumption in favour of Morocco as the proper forum
for the determination of issues
arising under that contract.
<P>

53   	Mr Cotman's submissions further are that the only
significance of an exclusive jurisdiction clause is that it creates a
contractual
obligations-based presumption in favour of a stay of proceedings.
His submissions accept that the contractual onus excludes forum
non conveniens
issues as the determinant.  His submissions accept that while the Court claims
a discretion to hear and determine
the matter before it, the onus is on the
plaintiff to show compelling reasons why the stay should not be granted to the
defendant.
<P>

54   	In para 14 of the plaintiff's submissions of 16 July 1999
it is suggested that the only issue that can sensibly arise in relation
to the
supply agreement is whether the particular documents proffered by OCE as its
letters of credit in performance of contract,
or any of them, were confirmed
irrevocable letters of credit referred to in the supply contract.  The
submission is then that this
is not an issue that arises under Moroccan law.
The submission is then as follows:
<P>

<i>`That is not an issue that arises under Moroccan law.  Whether a letter of
credit is confirmed or irrevocable, or whether the document
is a letter of
credit, is a matter which, in international trade, falls to be determined by
reference to principles that must transcend
the domestic law of one of the
contracting parties.  In particular, because this is a matter that deals not
only with the purchase
price, but also has broader financial implications for
the vendor, such as the ability to use the instrument as security, the issues
have almost nothing to do with the domestic law of the purchaser.</i>
<P>

<i>Indeed, as appears from the documents issued by BMCE at the request of OCE,
they purported to be issued in accordance with the "credits
documentaires
version revised 1993 No. 500 of the CCI":  see affidavit of Sarwat McGuid of 17
September 1998 Annexure `G', page 10,
and as to the translation, see the
translation of Braid sequence No. 909 which provides the translation "this
credit is subject to
RUU relating to documentary credits revised version of
1993 BR No. 500 of the CCI".  The ICC, or CCI is the International Chamber
of
Commerce and UCP 500 is a publication of the ICC's commission on banking
technique and practice published by the ICC and approved
by the Banking
Commission on 10 March 1993, effective from 1 January 1994 as "Uniformed
Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits
- 1993 Revision".  Far from being
an issue of domestic Moroccan law, OCE's banker for the purpose of issuing a
letter of credit to
satisfy its obligations under the contract, being BMCE,
expressly embraced the international standard as the applicable standard
in
relation to whether the documents it was issuing were letters of credit and
whether they would be accepted for confirmation by
another bank.  As to the
significance of confirmation, see Article 9 of UCP 500 which replaced Article
10 of UCP 400.  As to the
significance of confirmation of a letter of credit in
International trade transactions, see Lord Denning's judgment in Trans Trust
S.P.R.L The Danubian Trading Co Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%202%20QB%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 2 QB 297</a> at 304ff.  As His
Lordship points out the significance of a confirmation letter of credit is not
confined merely to the payment of
the price or the securing of the payment of
the price to the vendor, it also constitutes a financial instrument which, as
His Lordship
notices, in the case of a trader permits, in whole or in part, the
financing of the trade transaction.</i>
<P>

<i>There is no sensible reason why contractual engagements called for in a
Supply Contract that may be expressly or implicitly the subject
of the law of a
particular jurisdiction ought themselves be the subject of the law of the same
jurisdiction.  Indeed, in international
trade transactions there may be a
substantial matrix of contracts each with a different implicit or nominated
choice of law and choice
of jurisdiction attaching to them, for example
insurance contracts and shipping contracts.</i>
<P>

<i>In the instant case, the First Defendant relies on the provisions of the
Supply Contract as providing an amnibus basis for a stay
because it is said
that the Supply Contract contains a contractual stipulation for exclusive
jurisdiction in the Courts of Morocco.'</i>
<P>

55   	I return then to the first question, namely the proper
construction of article VI.  It is important, it seems to me, to recognise
that
albeit that there are a number of different versions of the appropriate
translation of the article contended for, there is a
degree of real commonality
notwithstanding the differences.
<P>

56   	Each of the respective translations begins with the word
"any".
<P>

57   	To my mind there is no material difference between use in
the article, depending as one looks at the different translations,
of the words
"relating to", as opposed to the words, "ensuing from".
<P>

58   	Subject to the matters referred to in para 21 of Mr
Colinard's affidavit of 19 April 1999, each of the alternative translations
use
the word "will".
<P>

59   	Nor do I see any material difference as between the
different translations between, on the one hand, use of the words "regarding
the performance of the stipulations of the present contract" and on the other
hand the words "in applying the provisions of the present
contract".
<P>

60   	To my mind the matters referred to in para 21 of Mr
Colinard's affidavit do not detract from the proper construction of article
VI
which in my view ought be read as similar in the extreme, to the clauses under
consideration in both <i>Gem Plastics</i> and in <i>FAI General</i><b>
</b><i>Insurance.</i>
<P>

61   	Dr Birch, who appears for OCE, has drawn the Court's
attention to <i>Austrian Lloyd</i><b> </b><i>Steamship Co v Gresham Life
Assurance Society Limited</i> (1903) 1 King's Bench 249.  For present purposes
the discussion of that case which appears in<i> FAI v Ocean Marine</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20NSWLR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 NSWLR
121</a> suffices:
<P>

<i>"The insured sued in England upon a policy of life insurance.  The insurer
applied for a stay on the ground that the policy provided
for submission of
disputes to the courts of Budapest.  The clause was in the terms:  &#180;For
all disputes which may arise out of
the contract of insurance, all the parties
interested expressly agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of
Budapest having
jurisdiction in such matters (at 249)".</i>
<P>

<i>It as held that the parties had agreed not only to submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts of Budapest, but also that they were obliged
to
refer disputes to those courts.  This was said to follow from the language of
the clause, it seems largely because the submission
to jurisdiction was
mutual".</i>
<P>

62   	In <i>AKAI Pty Limited v Peoples Insurance Co Limited</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20188%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 188 CLR 418</a>, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 444 cited the following
passage from a decision of Fullager J in <i>Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes
v Wilson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/62.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 62</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2094%20CLR%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 94 CLR 577</a> at 587:
<P>

<i>"When parties to a contract say - &#180;all disputes between us shall be
determined by such and such a tribunal', they are saying
that, if a dispute
arises between them, the claimant will seek a determination of it by the
designated tribunal, and that the other
party will not object to the
jurisdiction of that tribunal.  But they are also saying that, as between them,
no other tribunal shall
have jurisdiction to determine disputes".</i>
<P>

63   	Dr Birch has referred the Court in relation to the
decision in <i>Austrian Lloyd Steamship</i> to the following passage which
appears in the judgment of Lord Justice Romer:-
<P>

<i>"This is a simple point;  and, though I can understand that different
persons might take different views of it, I must say that to
my mind the
meaning of condition 24 is that contended for by the defendant.  The question
is this:  does the condition merely mean
that, if one of the parties to the
contract is sued by the other in the Court of Budapest, he will not take any
objection to its
jurisdiction;  or, does it mean that the parties mutually
agree that, if any dispute arises under the contract it shall be determined
by
the Court in Budapest? Having regard to the nature of the contract and its
language, I am of opinion that the latter construction
is the correct one".
[(1903) 1 KB at 251-252.]</i>
<P>

64   	To my mind article VI is an exclusive jurisdiction clause
properly construed.  
<P>

65   	I turn then to the second of the questions referred to
above, namely the reach of article VI.
<P>

66   	The plaintiff emphasises its submission that in this case
the supply contract, by calling for a performance bond, called up
a series of
contracts extending from ABS Gulf through NAB to BMCE to OCE to provide the
guarantee itself and a contract ensuring
loss under that guarantee between ABS
and EFIC.
<P>

67   	In <i>IBM Australia v National Distribution Services
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 466</a> the Court had occasion to deal with an
arbitration clause in an agreement governed by the laws of New South Wales
which was expressed
to govern "any controversy or claim arising out of or
related to this agreement or the breach thereof".
<P>

68   	Clarke JA at 483 said:
<P>

<i>"The phrases &#180;in relation to' or &#180;related to' are of the widest
import and should not, in the absence of compelling reasons
to the contrary, be
read down".</i>
<P>

69   	To my mind that construction is appropriate to be given to
the words in article VI, "any dispute <u>relating to</u> the present contract"
or "any dispute <u>ensuing from</u> the present contract".
<P>

70   	A number of submissions have been addressed to the
question of the nature of parties to and terms of the agreement alleged
in
paragraphs 16 through to 19 of the contentions.
<P>

71   	During submissions directed to the question of whether or
not there was in existence what he referred to as a tripartite agreement,
Mr
Dubler of counsel, who appears for EFIC, submitted that on no basis could an
exclusive jurisdiction clause be read into an agreement
which he asserted was
alleged to exist between Gulf, OCE and BMCE.  For one thing, on Mr Dubler's
submissions, BMCE was simply not
a party to the supply agreement.
<P>

72   	Dr Birch in turn submitted that the suggestion of a
tripartite agreement was misconceived.  On his submissions the supply
agreement
bound Gulf and OCE.  Arguably, pursuant to that agreement, there had come into
existence the provision of a letter of credit
by BMCE to OCE.  On Dr Birch's
submissions there is a third agreement which binds the Bank and was entered
into between the Bank
and BMCE when the Bank provided a stand-by letter of
credit in favour of BMCE, being the back to back letter of credit.
<P>

73   	It is necessary to return, it seems to me, to the way in
which the matter is pleaded in the contentions in order to treat
with the
argument which was to the effect that there was pleaded and in existence an
agreement between parties additional to Gulf
and OCE, which agreement the Court
would be required to look to in order to find or negate the proposition that
the terms pleaded
in paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 of the amended summons were to be
implied.
<P>

74   	I return to the reach of article VI in the contract and in
particular the words "any dispute relating to the present contract"
or "any
dispute ensuing from the present contract" or "any dispute flowing from the
present contract".  To my mind any of those formulations
embrace disputes as to
existence of implied terms whereunder OCE is said to have been obliged to only
call on BMCE to pay to it the
sum of $US120,000 or any part of it in the event
that Gulf wrongfully failed to perform some material contractual obligation
arising
under the supply contract or an obligation occasioning some loss or
damage to OCE;  or whereunder OCE is said to have been obliged
not so to
conduct itself in relation to Gulf as to cause a breach of the supply contract
by Gulf, or whereunder OCE is said to have
been obliged not to call on BMCE to
pay all or any part of the $US120,000 to it in respect of any act or omission
of Gulf caused
or occasioned by the conduct of OCE.
<P>

[See the terms of paras 17, 18 and 19 of the contentions]
<P>

75   	To my mind also so embraced are questions of breach of
such suggested terms and plainly enough, it seems to me, the questions
raised
by clause  23 of the contentions which makes very plain that questions of the
repudiation and acceptance of repudiation of
the supply agreement are
intimately and necessarily connected with questions of when and if and with
what legal consequences, the
surety agreement was brought to an end as to all
rights and liabilities under it.
<P>

76   	To do justice to the arguments put by Mr Dubler in support
of Mr Cotman's submissions, and as I understand it accepted by
Mr Cotman in the
same regard, those submissions seek to separate out as different contracts the
supply agreement and the suggested
agreement to which Gulf, OCE, BMCE and/or
the Bank were parties.  The submission was that the mere existence, should the
Court so
hold, of an exclusive jurisdiction clause within the supply agreement,
could not possibly, on any basis, be said to extend to other
agreements albeit
entered into by the plaintiff and OCE, if also party to those other agreements,
were third parties, namely here
BMCE and/or National Bank.
<P>

77   	To my mind the submissions of Dr Birch on this area are of
substance.  His submissions are that the materials before the Court
do not
suggest there to have been any tripartite agreement nor any agreement between
all four parties.  On his submissions the dominant
and operative question for
present purposes is simply whether OCE acted wrongfully against Gulf when
making its demand of BMCE, which
in turn of course carried through when BMCE
made a demand on the Bank.  On Dr Birch's submissions the answer to that
question can
only be given by reference to the terms and conditions express and
implied of the supply agreement.
<P>

78   	To my mind it is plain that any of the implied terms
sought to be propounded by Gulf in paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 of the contentions
can only be imported by reference to the express terms and conditions of the
supply agreement, going outside those terms only by
applying usual principles
dealing with implied terms.  See <i>Codelfa.</i>
<P>

79   	I turn next to the discretionary considerations which are
the subject of submissions.
<P>

80   	It is common ground, as I understand it, that the Court
having held that article VI is an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the
forum non
conveniens test is not applied and the Court commences from the position that
the parties should be held to their bargain.
 The proper approach is that taken
in <i>FAI v Ocean Marine</i> 41 NSWLR at 569 and in particular in the passage
earlier referred to under the heading "The exercise of jurisdiction".
<P>

81   	In short, a stay should be granted unless strong cause for
not doing so is shown by Gulf.  Has then the plaintiff discharged
the burden of
proving strong cause for the Court not exercising its jurisdictions by granting
a stay?
<P>

82   	The plaintiff's submissions seeking to discharge this
burden of proof involve the following matters.
<P>

83   	The plaintiff suggests that there was certainly a central
issue which arose as between the plaintiff and the first defendant,
namely
whether the particular documents proffered by OCE as its letters of credit in
purported performance of the contract, or any
of them, were confirmed
irrevocable letters of credit referred to in the supply contract.  The
plaintiff's submissions in this regard
followed submissions as to a number of
suggested clear non-issues in the proceedings.
<P>

84   	The submissions' structure was, firstly, to identify that
the proceedings were brought pursuant to the supply agreement Gulf
and OCE -
claim for damages;  secondly, the surety contract Gulf - OCE for restitution or
damages;  thirdly, the alleged surety contract
Gulf - NAB - BMCE - OCE - for an
injunction to restrain payment by NAB to BMCE;  and fourthly, the insurance
contract ABS - EFIC
- the claim for indemnity in relation to the loss for
wrongful call by OCE on BMCE under the surety contract.
<P>

85   	Mr Cotman's submissions then were that there is no issue
but that OCE called on BMCE to pay the surety bond to it as a result
of Gulf's
failure to deliver the meat called for under the supply agreement.  The
submissions were further that the terms of the
supply agreement were not in
issue.  Of course it goes without saying it would seem that the proper
construction of those terms may
well be in issue.
<P>

86   	I interpolate that unless and until the defences of the
three defendants are before the Court it will not be possible to be
entirely
clear as to precisely what the issues to be raised by any or all of them are.
Plainly enough the first defendant has not
yet filed a defence.
<P>

87   	Mr Cotman's submissions then include that there is no
issue but that the only matter raised by Gulf as discharging it from
its
obligation to deliver the meat is the failure by OCE to put in place a letter
of credit complying with the contractual requirements
of the supply
agreement.
<P>

88   	A further suggested non-issue is put by the plaintiff in
terms of the supply agreement as having required OCE to procure the
irrevocable
confirmed letter of credit in time for shipment to be made in conformity with
the supply contract, it then being submitted
that there is no issue but that
OCE purported to issue the documentary letters of credit in conformity with the
contract.
<P>

89   	As to the suggested central issue, paragraphs 15 to 18
inclusive of the plaintiff's submissions have already been set out.
 The
plaintiffs further submitted as follows:
<P>

<i>`It is submitted that one reason the Court would not grant a stay is that if
the contract that contains the exclusive jurisdiction
clause itself calls for a
matrix of other contractual arrangements, some of which will not be connected
to the jurisdiction nominated
in the contract, the Defendant cannot complain if
the Plaintiff seeks to litigate those issues in another jurisdiction.  That is
the case here where the Supply Contract, by calling for a Performance Bond,
calls up a series of contracts extending from ABS Gulf
through NAB to BMCE top
OCE to provide the guarantee itself and a contract ensuring loss under that
guarantee between ABS Gulf and
EFIC.</i>
<P>

<i>In fact, the only issue in the case that is to be litigated wholly within
the four corners of the Supply Agreement, is the claim for
damages for breach
of the Supply Agreement ABS Gulf against OCE.</i>
<P>

<i>All other issues in the case fall to be litigated under or in relation to
the Surety Agreement.  While the obligation to produce a
surety arises under
the Supply Agreement, the Surety Agreement itself does not.  The Surety
Agreement is a four party arrangement
between ABS Gulf, NAB, MBCE and OCE.
Under that contract NAB at the request of ABS Gulf requested BMCE to go surety
to OCE.  BMCE
did so by the correspondence annexed and translated in the
affidavit of Mr Colinard of 26 May 1999, see Annexures `A', `B' and `C'
to that
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>A relevant issue is whether there are domestic Australian proceedings
raising the same issues as the proceedings that it is sought
to stay:  see LEP
International Pty Limited v LAN Traffic Expressed Service Inc  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR
614</a> at 620.</i>
<P>

<i>If the analysis of the issues of the case set out above is correct, there is
no domestic Moroccan evidentiary issue that can concern
the various people
listed in Mr Hilmer's affidavit.  That is because the only issue in contest is
whether OCE produced an irrevocable
confirmed letter of credit in satisfaction
of its contractual obligations.  It is common ground that no letter of credit
was ever
confirmed.  Therefore the issue can only be whether what was supplied
by OCE, via BMCE, to ABS Gulf was confirmable but was not confirmed
for some
reason unrelated to the position of OCE and BMCE.  It is for that reason that
Mr Colinard deposes that it is anticipated
the principle evidentiary issue will
be whether what was received by ABS Gulf could have been confirmed.  As the
Plaintiff would
understand it, that is a matter for bankers other than BMCE.
It is conspicuous that the BMCE expectation was of confirmation by an
Australian Bank in that it requested that ANZ to confirm the documents in
favour of ABS Gulf, which ANZ declined to do:  see affidavit
of McGuid, 14
October 1998, Annexure `B' being ANZ letter of 19 September 1998 and McGuid
affidavit of 17 September 1998 Annexure
`D' being ANZ letter of 28 August 1998
and the same affidavit Annexure `I' being ANZ letter of 9 September 1998, each
of which letters
notifies ABS Gulf that ANZ declines to confirm the documents
notwithstanding the request of BMCE.  Prima facia the relevant population
of
bankers for the purposes of ascertaining whether the letters of credit were
confirmable, though not confirmed, is Australian bankers.</i>
<P>

<i>In relation to the proceedings concerning the surety sum and the insurance
thereof, the most convenient forum for determination of
those issues is
Australia.</i>
<P>

<i>As to the elements relevant for consideration in relation to forum
non-conveniens the following matters are submitted to be relevant:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	There is no issue of fact as to the only matter contended to be a breach
of the Supply Contract that would justify seizure of
the deposit being, the
Plaintiffs' failure to deliver meat in conformity with the time schedules
provided for in the Contract.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	On the other hand, there is no issue that the contract provided for the
First Defendant to supply a confirmable irrevocable letter
of credit to the
Plaintiff in sufficient time to allow shipment to Morocco in conformity with
the contractual time stipulations in
the Supply Contract.  The only evidence
before the Court is that while a great many documents were submitted by the
First Defendant
to the Plaintiff as letters of credit satisfying its
contractual obligations no banker, including BMCE at its Paris branch, or ANZ
in Australia (BMCE's local correspondent) would confirm the documents.</i>
<P>

<i>In the absence of a Defence it is impossible to know whether OCE:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	disputes that it was in breach of its obligation to supply a confirmable
irrevocable letter of credit but contends that it was
nonetheless entitled to
seize the Performance Bond;  or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	asserts that what it supplied was a confirmable irrevocable letter of
credit conforming to the contract, so that the Plaintiff
was in breach of
contract in failing to deliver.</i>
<P>

<i>On either of the positions the Defendant might adopt there is no "Moroccan"
issue.  The first of the contentions must simply arise
on a construction of the
Supply Contract in order to determine whether the Plaintiff could be in breach
of the contract by non-delivery
notwithstanding that it had not been provided
with a confirmable irrevocable letter of credit.  On the second issue, that
what was
provided by OCE as a confirmable irrevocable letter of credit was such
notwithstanding the Plaintiffs' failure to obtain confirmation
of the document
from any bank, that is an issue to be resolved according to the law and
practices of bankers outside Morocco because
it is to bankers in the exporters
country that one would first look for confirmation and finance based on that
confirmation.</i>
<P>

<i>In short, it appearing from the affidavit of Mr Collinard that the law of
Morocco is the same as the law of England and Australia
as to the
interdependent nature of the obligation to pay and the obligation to deliver
goods under a contract for supply and the
nature of the payment called for
under the contract being described in uncontroversial and unambiguous terms,
the only issue is whether
there is some answer to the experience of the
Plaintiff that the documents proffered by the First Defendant did not answer to
contractual
description in that no bank would confirm them.</i>
<P>

<i>In short, in relation to the present claim in relation to the wrongful
appropriation of the Performance Bond there is simply no pressing
reason why
that issue would not be determined in Australia.</i>
<P>

<i>The determination of that issue will also affect two pieces of litigation
which are wholly domestic:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the injunction against National Australia Bank paying the monies called
for under the Performance Bond;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	proceedings against Export Finance Insurance Corporation, the
Plaintiffs' insurer under a "unfair call" policy in relation to
the Bond.'
</i>
<P>

90   	Mr Dubler, in adding to those discretionary considerations
and by and large supporting Mr Cotman's submissions, submitted
that a further
discretionary consideration which weighed strongly against the Court here
staying the proceedings, involved the fact
that the parties have taken as a
given that the proceedings in so far as issues between the plaintiff and EFIC
are concerned can
on no conceivable basis be otherwise than dealt with by this
Court.  In those circumstances Mr Dubler raises a spectre, should these
proceedings in so far as they involve the plaintiff, the first defendant and
the National Bank be stayed.  There is, it is submitted,
a possibility that the
courts of Morocco may find one way on the question of whether or not the letter
of credit proffered complied
with article VI, only to find that the very same
issue but with other witnesses and evidence might have to be determined again
in
this jurisdiction, when and if the plaintiff's proceedings against the third
defendant would be pursued.
<P>

91   	To my mind, and having taken into account all of those
discretionary considerations, the position on the evidence is that
the
plaintiff has not shown strong cause for the Court not to exercise its
jurisdiction by granting a stay.
<P>

92   	Whilst it is clear that the submissions opposing the grant
of a stay seek to rely upon the several sets of issues now raised,
there having
been brought into existence following the supply agreement the so-called
ancillary agreements or arrangements, the most
significant matter is simply
that the parties have solemnly and in writing, regardless of which of the
translations be preferred,
by article VI in the supply agreement clearly stated
their mutual agreement that disputes arising from, ensuing from or relating
to
the supply agreement, are to be determined by the courts of Casablanca.
<P>

93   	I am by no means satisfied that any of the discretionary
factors put forward by Mr Cotman or Mr Dubler are sufficient to require
the
Court's discretion to be exercised otherwise than by granting a stay of the
proceedings.  It is common ground, as I have understood
it, that the courts in
Casablanca are competent to hear the proceedings in so far as the respective
rights and obligations of Gulf
and OCE are concerned.  The position in so far
as other parties are concerned and the contractual relationships between other
parties
are, subject to the question of EFIC, likely to be determined when the
courts of Casablanca determine the issues of fact and law
which separate Gulf
from OCE.
<P>

94   	There are a number of discretionary considerations which
plainly, it seems to me, favour the courts in Casablanca hearing
the matters
which separate OCE and Gulf.  Importantly of course the contract was written in
French.  French is a language regularly
used in the courts of Morocco.  The
Laws of Morocco and the codes, civil code, commercial code and criminal code
are published both
in Arabic and French.  Contracts under Moroccan Law may be
written either in French or Arabic to be valid.  The civil and commercial
codes
are either those codes established in Morocco during the French Protectorate or
those which are drawn on essentially French
sources.  To the best of the
knowledge of the Moroccan Consul there are no Moroccan lawyers in Australia nor
any Australian lawyers
with any expertise in Moroccan law.  [See affidavit of
B. Hillman of 13 May 1999, paragraphs 1-12].
<P>

95   	There is then as a discretionary consideration also, the
question of what is the proper law of the supply contract.
<P>

96   	The question of whether or not the proper law of the
supply contract is the law of Morocco, I accept, may be reached in the
first
instance by inference from the form of the contract and its terms - this occurs
where there is no express choice of law clause,
as opposed to a choice of
jurisdiction clause.  I accept that the appropriate test is to ask whether in
the contract:
<P>

<i>". . . the parties have by its express terms or by necessary implication
from the language used evinced a common intention as to the
system of law by
reference to which their mutual rights and obligations under it are to be
ascertained" -</i> see<i> Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation v Kuwait Insurance
Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20AC%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) AC 50</a> at 61.
<P>

97   	I accept that, if no inference can be drawn as to the
unexpressed intention of the parties, then the proper law of the contract
is to
be determined as that system of law "with which the transaction has its closest
and most real connection", re <i>United Railways of Havana v Regla Warehouses
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20Ch%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) Ch 52</a> at 91 and see Conflict of Laws in Australia, 6th edition
by P E Nygh pp 292-301.
<P>

98   	The principle is that where the parties to the contract
have expressly chosen a foreign court or tribunal for the determination
of
disputes under the contract, then while not conclusive, this will usually raise
a strong presumption that  the proper law of the
contract is the law of that
foreign court or tribunal (see<b> </b><i>John Kaldor Fabric Maker v Mitchell
Cotts Freight (Aust) Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 172</a> at 187:
<P>

<i>"Prior to the decisions in James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth
Street Estates and Compagnie d'Armement Maritime SA v Compagnie
Tunisienne, it
was generally thought that an express provision in a contract referring
disputes under the contract to arbitration
in a particular country, or to
resolution by reference to the laws of a particular country justified the
conclusion that the law
of that country was the proper law of the contract,
either on the basis that the appropriate inference was that that was the actual
intention of the parties, or on the basis that that provision justified the
imputation to the parties of that intention:  see Hamlyn
(at 207-208, 212-213,
215 and 216);  Spurrier v La Cloche  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%20AC%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] AC 446</a> at 450;  NV Kwik Hoo Tong
Handel Maatschappij v James Finlay and Co Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%20AC%20604" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927] AC 604</a> at 608 and 609-610
and Tzortzis v Monark Line A/B  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 WLR 406</a> at 414;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20All%20ER%20949" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] 1 All ER 949</a> at
954.</i>
<P>

<i>However, since the decisions in James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth
Street Estates and Compagnie d'Armement Maritime SA v
Compagnie Tunisienne, it
has been accepted in England (see, eg, Astro Venturoso Compania Naviera v
Hellenic Shipyards SA (The "Mariannina")
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 12</a> at 14) that
the effect of those decisions is to reduce the importance of an arbitration
clause.  As Lord Wilberforce put it in Compagnie
d'Armament Maritime SA v
Compagnie Tunisienne (at 600):</i>
<P>

<i>"My Lords, for the reasons given I am of opinion that this language is too
strong, too absolute.  Neither authority nor commercial
reality supports the
necessity for so rigid a rule.  An arbitration clause must be  treated as an
indication, to be considered together
with the rest of the contract and
relevant surrounding facts.  Always it will be a strong indication;  often,
especially where there
are parties of different nationality or a variety of
transactions which may arise under the contract, it will be the only clear
indication.
 But in some cases it must give way where other indications are
clear."'</i>
<P>

99   	To my mind the proper law of the supply contract is the
law of Morocco.  That the proper law of the supply contract is the
law of
Morocco is of course of relevance as a discretionary consideration.
<P>

100   	Since French is a language regularly used in Moroccan
courts, plainly enough there would not in Moroccan courts be the same
requirements concerning interpretation of the contract as would have to occur
in Australia through translators.  An example of the
difficulties in different
translations has already been referred to in relation to the proper
construction of article VI.
<P>

101   	The contract, namely the supply contract, the written
contract of 22 May 1998, was entered into in Morocco.  The principal
place I
accept, of performance of the contract, is Morocco.  BMCE is a Moroccan
corporation, OCE is a Moroccan corporation.  	A further
discretionary
consideration is that proceedings on the contract in Morocco are able to be
conducted in the language of the contract.
<P>

102   	Returning briefly to the implied terms upon which the
plaintiff founds earlier referred to.
<P>

103   	Dr Birch submitted that effectively the plaintiff, in
seeking to make good its implied terms case, is seeking to read into
article V
after the words "Moroccan Bank" on the second line, words to the effect "and
that OCE will not call upon the bank under
the instrument unless there has been
a breach by the supplier of the terms of the contract".  It seems to me that
that is a submission
of substance.  In short, the undertaking of Gulf to
deliver to OCE referred to in article V is, and its proper construction and any
implications to be imported in relation to that matter are, the essential
gravamen and basis of the matters put in para 17 to 19
of the amended
summons.
<P>

104   	It is necessary then to deal with two particular further
topics and costs.  The first relates to the position which is to
obtain in
relation to the existing interlocutory regime in place by the injunctions
against the bank.  The second relates to the
discrete question of the way
forward as between the plaintiff and EFIC.
<P>

105   	Following the reasons above given, it will be apparent
that the Court is disposed to stay the proceedings permanently in
so far as the
plaintiff's proceedings against the first defendant is concerned.
<P>

106   	I have no doubt but that the injunctions presently extant
against the bank require to be continued until further order, the
spirit and
intent of the short minutes of order being that those injunctions will continue
up to a point in time when there is an
application to discharge the
injunctions, again depending as the Moroccan proceedings are determined one way
or the other.
<P>

107   	I will hear from the parties in a moment on the subject
of costs but the question which counsel can see I have had some requirement
for
assistance on your submissions is the formal order as far as the proceedings
against the National Australia Bank are concerned.
<P>

[Following further submissions, orders were made on 30 July 1999 staying the
proceedings against the first defendant permanently
and dealing with costs and
related ancillary matters.]
