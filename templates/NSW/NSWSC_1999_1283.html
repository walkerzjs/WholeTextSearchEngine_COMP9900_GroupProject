<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	This dispute arises out of the Defendant's termination of a
contract for the sale to the Plaintiff of an industrial commercial
property
("the Gogard Contract").  
<P>

2   	The property is at 156 to 158 Parramatta Road, Camperdown
("the property).  It consists of two parcels of land, namely, that
land in Auto
Consol 154549-22 and that in Folio Identifier 12/79120 being Lot 12 in
Deposited Plan 79120.  The vendor was Satnaq
Pty Limited ("the Defendant").

<P>

3   	The vendor's agent was an entity trading as Taylor
Nicholas.  The sale was handled by Mr Nick Spasevski.
<P>

4   	The property was, at all material times and until 18 March
1998, owned by the Defendant.  The Defendant is a trustee company,
its
principals and directors being Mr Donald Arthur Carruthers and Mr Allen Barry
Wickham.
<P>

5   	Gogard Pty Limited ("the Plaintiff") is also a trustee
company.  The principal on behalf of the Plaintiff is Mr Graeme Hayes.
<P>

6   	Mr Graeme Hayes also provided consulting services to
Carbest Pty Limited and Yengrin Pty Limited.
<P>

<b> Overview of Matters in Dispute</b>
<P>

7   	The dispute in this case arises primarily over the deposit
paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant under the Gogard contract
for the sale
of the property and the damage said to arise to the Plaintiff from the loss of
a discount on the market price which
occurred when the contract to sell the
property to the Plaintiff was terminated.
<P>

8   	The Defendant terminated the Gogard contract because of an
alleged failure on behalf of the Plaintiff  to complete the contract
according
to its terms.
<P>

9   	The property was sold to a third party while the deposit
paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant under the supposedly terminated
first
contract for sale has been retained by the agent of the Defendant.
<P>

10   	The Plaintiff seeks return of the deposit and damages for
wrongful termination of the contract of sale.  The Defendant, in
cross-claim,
seeks reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the failed sale.
<P>

<b>Factual Background</b>
<P>

11   	In 1997 Mr Spasevski listed the property for sale.  The
property was offered to the Plaintiff through October and November
 and until 4
December 1997.  During that time there were some discussions between the
parties about the terms of the Gogard contract.
 The topics discussed included
the time for completion of the contract and the amount of the deposit to be
paid.
<P>

12   	The Plaintiff pursued the purchase of the property in
order to provide for the goals of a joint venture agreement to which
it was a
party.  The joint venture was between the Plaintiff company and another
company, Lassgol Pty Limited.  The Plaintiff, at
all material times, had been
the registered proprietor of a property at 180 Salisbury Road, Camperdown ("the
Salisbury Road property").
 The Plaintiff's course of action was to be as
follows.  The Plaintiff would purchase the property from the Defendant.  The
lessor
of the Salisbury Road property at that time would move its operations to
the property.  The Salisbury Road property would then be
used for the purpose
of a residential development undertaken by the joint venture between the
Plaintiff and Lassgol Pty Limited.
<P>

13   	The funds required for the Plaintiff company's purchase of
the property was to be raised from the sale of a property at 41-57
Mallet
Street, Camperdown ("the Mallet Street property") by Carbest Pty Limited
("Carbest").  Carbest was, in 1997 the owner of the
Mallet Street property.
Carbest intended, at that time, to sell the Mallet Street property subject to a
development application being
approved by the South Sydney Council.  It was the
intention of Carbest to provide monies out of the proceeds of sale of the
Mallet
Street property to Gogard Pty Limited for the purposes of purchasing the
property the subject of these proceedings.
<P>

14   	On 2 October1997, Mr Spasevski, Mr Hayes and Mr Wickham
met and inspected the property.  At that meeting, they had a conversation,
to
the following effect about a lease over that property:
<P>

HAYES:	"How long has the O'Briens lease to run?"
<P>

WICKHAM: 	"Four years"
<P>

HAYES:	"What are O'Brien's doing?"
<P>

WICKHAM:	"I'm not sure, they may sub-let.  We have the right to sub-let, they
are doing a strategic plan.  This is their most profitable
outlet and they have
about 120 all over the country.  Don looks after that side and he is doing the
negotiating with them".
<P>

HAYES:	"I would like to retain the air conditioning and the office partitions.
The condition of the building is not of concern,
we intend to put a building
envelope within the building for the factory.  We will open the windows down
the Mallett Street side
so passers-by can see the chocolates in production and
we intend to put a coffee shop in the front where the present office space
is.
You should be able to get a good pay out for the surrender of the O'Brien's
lease.(Wickham affidavit 29 May 1998 para 2)
<P>

15   	There is conflicting evidence as to the balance of the
conversation.  However, it is not necessary at this stage to adopt
a view on
the reliability of the various accounts (see Hayes affidavit 14 May 1998 para
6). 
<P>

16   	On 14 October1997 Mr Hayes of the Plaintiff met with Mr
Spasevski, Mr Wickham and Mr Carruthers.  At that meeting, a conversation
to
the following effect took place:
<P>

HAYES:	"Would vacant possession be by the end of February?"
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"We are talking to O'Brien Glass the tenant on the terms of
vacating the premises."
<P>

HAYES:	"I have already sold a property and I require the premises to relocate
my chocolate factory.  I am concerned that you will
not be able to get O'Brien
Glass out by that time."
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"O'Briens have indicated that they will be out by January, no later
than February."
<P>

HAYES:	"What's happening about the air conditioning plant and partitions?"
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"If O'Brien Glass leaves them there do you want them?"
<P>

HAYES:	"Yes.  I'm not worried about the condition of the building inside
because I have to build a new thermal skin for the manufacture
and storage of
chocolates.  I would like to have the settlement in April 1998 as I have a sale
which will be completed at that time."
<P>

WICKHAM:	"No way, I won't accept a settlement in April."
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"I also agree that settlement cannot take place in April.  The end
of February is the latest."
<P>

HAYES:	"I'll have to think about that and come back to the agents". (Carruthers
affidavit 12 May 1998  para 11  also see Wickham
affidavit 12 May 1998 para
11)
<P>

17   	At a date between 17 and 24 November1997, the Defendant's
solicitor, Mr Robert Minter, sent a draft contract to the Plaintiff's
solicitor, Mr Lindsay Parker of L.G Parker &amp; Co. solicitors. 
<P>

18   	The purchase price of the property was agreed at
$1,347,500.
<P>

19   	A telephone conversation took place between Mr Hayes and
Mr Carruthers on 6 November1997:
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"What's the problem?"
<P>

HAYES:	"I am concerned that O'Briens will not be able to vacate the property in
time."
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"I have a meeting with O'Briens tomorrow to negotiate the date for
them to vacate and I will get back to you"
<P>

HAYES:	"I would like to have an April settlement"
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"The settlement date is end of February.  I have told you this
before.  If you're having trouble with the settlement,
Nick has another
prospective buyer so you will need to let me know what you are doing."
<P>

HAYES:	"No, its not necessary to talk to another party, I require the building
for my chocolate manufacturing and will proceed subject
to vacant
possession."
<P>

CARRUTHERS:	"I will ring you tomorrow after the meeting with O'Brien Glass with
a definite date as to settlement" (Carruthers affidavit
12 May 1998 para 13)
<P>

20   	The next day, Mr Carruthers confirmed a settlement date at
the end of February with Mr Hayes.  Mr Hayes represented that he
wanted to
proceed with the sale (Carruthers affidavit 12 May 1998 para 14).
<P>

21   	On 28 November1997, Mr Parker, solicitor for the
Plaintiffs telephoned Mr Minter, solicitor to the Plaintiffs and a conversation
took place to the following effect:
<P>

PARKER:	"I have received your contract.  My client will require vacant
possession in two to three months.  Will that be possible?"
<P>

MINTER:	"I believe it will be.  My client has negotiated for the tenant to
vacate and I will send you a copy of a further special
condition for your
approval."
<P>

PARKER:	"My client understands that there is air-conditioning in the premises
and wants it included in the sale."
<P>

MINTER:	"I am not aware of any air-conditioning.  I believe there is some owned
by the tenant.  I will check with my client."
<P>

PARKER:	"Is there a survey?"
<P>

 MINTER:	"No.
<P>

PARKER:	"My client requires the penalty interest rate of 12% specified in
Special Condition 35 to be reduced to 8%"
<P>

MINTER:	"I believe that this will be OK; I will check with my client".
<P>

PARKER:	"My client requires you to remove the Section 172 Building Certificate
clause referred to in Special Condition 29.1"
<P>

MINTER:	"My client will not agree to that.  I will confirm what we have
discussed by telephone once I have obtained instructions".
(Minter affidavit 12
May 1998, para 7)
<P>

22   	The parties exchanged contracts on 4 December1997.  On
that date the Plaintiff paid the Defendant's agent a deposit of $134,750
("the
deposit").  The agent continues to hold the deposit.
<P>

23   	No survey was attached to the contract of sale.  Clause 8
of the contract contained the vendor's right to rescind the contract
and read
as follows:
<P>

"<b>Clause 8	Vendor's right to rescind</b>
<P>

The vendor can rescind if -
<P>

8.1	the vendor is, on reasonable grounds, unable or unwilling to comply with a
requisition;
<P>

8.2	the vendor serves a notice of intention to rescind that specifies the
requisition and those grounds; and
<P>

8.3	the purchaser does not serve a notice waiving the requisition within 14
days after that service." [PX5 5]
<P>

24   	The deposit is agreed in clause 9 of the contract:
<P>

"<b>9	Purchaser's default</b>
<P>

If the purchaser does not comply with this contract (or a notice under or
relating to it) in an essential respect, the vendor can
terminate by serving a
notice and after the termination - 
<P>

9.1	keep or recover the deposit (to a maximum of 10% of the price);
<P>

9.2	hold any other money paid by the purchaser under this contract as security
for anything recoverable under the clause -
<P>

9.2.1	for 12 months after the termination; or
<P>

9.2.2.	if the vendor commences proceedings under this clause within 12 months,
until those proceedings are concluded; and
<P>

9.3	sue the purchaser either -
<P>

9.3.1	where the vendor has resold the property under a contract made within 12
months after the termination, to recover -
<P>

&#183;	the deficiency on resale (with credit for any of the deposit kept or
recovered and after allowance for any capital gains
tax payable on anything
recovered under this clause); and
<P>

&#183;	the reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the purchaser's
non-compliance with this contract or the notice and of resale
and any attempted
resale; or
<P>

9.3.2	to recover damages for breach of the contract." [PX5 5]
<P>

25   	The completion date is mentioned in clause 15:
<P>

"<b>15	Completion date</b>
<P>

The parties must complete by the completion date and, if they do not, a party
can serve a notice to complete if that party is otherwise
entitled to do so."
[PX5 6]
<P>

26   	Clause 30 of the contract read:
<P>

"<b>Clause 30	Purchaser's acknowledgments</b>
<P>

The purchaser agrees that:
<P>

30.1	no reliance has been made on any warranty or representation by the vendor
or any person on its behalf except as expressly provided
in this contract;
<P>

30.2	this contract constitutes the whole contract between the parties;
<P>

30.3	it has relied entirely on its own enquires relating to, and inspection of,
the property, all improvements and any inclusions
referred to in the contract
and the use to which the property maybe put.
<P>

30.4	it is purchasing the property in its present state of repair and condition
and must not make any objection, requisition or
claim for compensation
concerning the state of repair or condition of or any latent or patent defect
in quality in the property."
[PX5 11-2]
<P>

27   	Clause 33 of the contract for sale provided that the
completion date was not later than 27 February 1998.  Clause 33 reads:
<P>

"<b>Clause 33 	Completion</b>
<P>

33.	The completion date is not later than 27 February 1998.  The property
shall, on the completion date be delivered to the purchaser
in a clean and tidy
condition." [PX5 12]
<P>

28   	The contract was subject to a further special condition in
clause 37:
<P>

"<b>37	Conditional contract</b>
<P>

This contract is conditional on the purchaser obtaining vacant possession of
the property under registered lease No. 3126056 to
O'Brien Glass Industries
Limited by the date herein prescribed for settlement.  In the event of the
vendor not obtaining vacant possession
of the property by the said date the
purchaser may give written notice of rescission to the vendor whereupon this
contract shall
be at an end and the provisions of Clause 19 of this contract
shall apply AND in the event that this contract shall not have been
rescinded
and vacant possession as aforesaid shall not have been attained within a
further two (2) months then either party may after
that time rescind this
contract by notice in writing to the other." [PX5 13]
<P>

29   	As at 4 December1997 the premises were occupied by a firm
trading as O'Brien's Glass Industries Pty Limited ("O'Brien's Glass").
<P>

30   	O'Brien's Glass vacated the premises sometime in late
December1997 or early January 1998.
<P>

31   	On 18 December1997, the Defendant's solicitor received a
letter enclosing Requisitions on Title of the property from the Plaintiff's
solicitors.  The Defendant's solicitors replied to the Requisitions by letter
dated 14 January 1998.  Point 11 of the requisitions
document reads:
<P>

"11.(a)	Is the Vendor in possession of a Survey Report in respect of the
subject property, and, if so, is he prepared to hand it
over at settlement?
<P>

(b)	Subject to Contract Survey should result satisfactorily and show that the
whole of the land is available to the Purchaser and
that there is no
encroachment by or upon the subject property." [PX5 45]
<P>

32   	The answer given to 11(a) was "No" and to 11(b) was
"Noted" [PX5 48].
<P>

33   	Paragraph  28 of the requisitions reads:
<P>

"28.	The Purchaser reserves the right to make such further requisitions and
observations as may arise from examination of the relevant
Certificate of Title
or out of searches survey or your replies hereto." [PX5 46]
<P>

34   	The vendor responded "Such an alleged right is not
admitted" and "Not applicable" [PX5 49].
<P>

35   	Further, requisition 32 reads:
<P>

"32.	Is/are the vendor/s aware of any matters which may detrimentally affect
the value or amenity of the property or the purchaser's
use or enjoyment
thereof including but without restriction, any notices from any person or
government body or any proposals to build
upon or carry out any works or
conduct any activities upon any surrounding properties (including any formal
development or building
applications relating to such surrounding properties)
or any other physical defects in the subject property?" [PX5 47]
<P>

36   	The answer given to this requisition was "No" [PX5 49].
<P>

37   	On 20 February the Defendant's solicitor sent a letter to
the Plaintiff's solicitors, which relevantly stated:
<P>

"The contract provides for settlement of this matter on 27 February next.
Settlement will take place at the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia at a time
convenient both to yourself and the Bank.  The Bank has requested a four days
advance notice of a settlement
time and your cooperation in this respect will
be appreciated." [Minter affidavit 12 May 1998 annexure "L" p 30)
<P>

38   	On 23 February 1998 at telephone conversation took place
between the respective solicitors of the Defendant and the Plaintiff.
 The
Plaintiff's solicitors explained that the Plaintiff could not settle on the
"prescribed date as its finance has fallen through".
 According to the
Defendant's solicitor the conversation included the words:
<P>

MR PARKER (Solicitor for the Plaintiff's):	"My client is selling a property in
Camperdown which sale is subject to development approval
and we expect to
obtain approval in mid to late March.  We seek your client's agreement whether
it would defer completion until that
time and, if so, for what consideration."
(Minter affidavit 12 May 1998 para 17)
<P>

39   	At that time the solicitor for the Defendant did not
extend the time for settlement.  In a letter of 24 February 1998, the
Defendant's solicitor confirmed that the Defendant was unwilling to provide for
an extension of time within which to complete. The
letter explained that if
settlement did not occur on 27 February 1998 then the Defendant would issue a
notice to complete under Special
Condition 34 of the contract (Minter affidavit
12 May 1998 annexure "N" p. 32).
<P>

40   	The Plaintiff's solicitors telephoned the Defendant's
solicitors on 25 February 1998 to again request an extension of time
within
which to complete.
<P>

41   	A letter of 25 February 1998 from the solicitors of the
Plaintiff to the solicitors of the Defendant read, relevantly:
<P>

"We acknowledge your client's refusal to consider our request for an extension
of time to complete and in this regard are instructed
to request that your
client re-consider its position.
<P>

In this regard as advised by telephone our client has a reliable arrangement to
fund this purchase which is dependant on the approval
by Council of another
property due to be given by Council on the 3 March 1998.  Our client's request
in the spirit of commercial
reality is based on our client accepting your
client's property with some significant defects: -
<P>

Firstly in relation to the condition the property has been left by the
departing tenants; and
<P>

Secondly in relation to the several matters of non-compliance disclosed in the
recent survey report obtained by our client (copy
enclosed) [the survey of 16
February 1998]" [PX5 65]
<P>

42   	The Survey report referred to was made by Souter &amp;
Associates, a firm of consulting surveyors and planners on 16 February
1998.
The findings of the survey report were:
<P>

"1.	Upon the land stands a two storey brick building with a corrugated metal
roof known as 156-158 Parramatta Road, Camperdown.
<P>

2.	Part of the eastern wall of the building stands over the eastern boundary of
the land by up to 205 mm.  An Easement for Support
for this part of the wall
has been created by Transfer No. J198678 and as shown on DP 217155.
<P>

3.	Part of the eastern boundary of the land passes through a 355mm wide brick
party wall and a 240 mm wide brick party wall.  This
party wall is common with
the adjacent shop, No. 154 Parramatta Roads, is also shown on Lot 1 of
Deposited Plan 538241.
<P>

4.	A street awning overhangs Parramatta Road and Mallett Street.  This awning
is behind the 3.66 metre kerb line of both streets.
 An external air
conditioning unit is situated on top of the Mallett Street awning.
<P>

5.	Minor measurement discrepancies exist once all the title survey plans are
compiled together.  Prior to any redevelopment of the
site we advise that the
land, or at least lots 4, 13, 16 and 17 be consolidated by a plan of survey and
registered at the Land Titles
Office.
<P>

6.	The land is partly fenced as shown on the sketch plan overleaf." [PX5 52]
<P>

43   	The report said further that "Apart from fencing
irregularities or as stated or shown on the sketch overleaf, there are no
other
visible encroachments by or upon the said land." [PX5 52]
<P>

44   	The Plaintiff relies on the matters at points 3 and 4 of
the surveyors report. 
<P>

45   	In response to the letter of 25 February 1998 and the
attached survey report, the Defendant's solicitors sent a letter on
27
February.  That letter read, in part:
<P>

"You [the Plaintiff's solicitor] also mentioned that there were certain matters
relating to survey and the state in which the tenant
left the property which
require my client's attention.  Without admitting that you are still within
time to make requisitions, please
identify the specific survey and tenancy
matters concerning your client so that those issues may be considered.
<P>

Notwithstanding the above, this matter was to be settled today.  As it was not,
I enclose a notice to complete."[PX5 55]
<P>

46   	The Defendant served a notice to complete dated 27
February 1998 [PX5 56].  The contract provided for the issuing of a notice
to
complete in Special Condition 34 in the following terms:
<P>

<b>"34	Notice to complete</b>
<P>

If this contract is not completed under clause 15 the party not in default may
serve written notice (including a notice served after
3:30 PM on the completion
date) requiring the other party:
<P>

34.1	if the notice is served on a Monday, to complete this contract within a
period of time which expires at or after 1:00 PM on
the second Friday after the
notice is served; or
<P>

34.2	if the notice is served on any other day, to complete this contract within
a period of at least 13 days after the service of
the notice,
<P>

34.3 	making time an essential condition of this contract in this respect both
at law and in equity,
<P>

and any such notice may be withdrawn at any time." [PX5 12]
<P>

47   	A letter was sent by the Defendant's solicitors to the
Plaintiff's solicitors on 3 March 1998.  That letter contained the
following:
<P>

"Notwithstanding prior correspondence and issue of my Notice to Complete, your
client has approached my client through the agent
to request further time
within which to complete this matter.  Your client also indicated to the agent
that he did not expect to
be in a position to complete within the two week
period nominated in my Notice to Complete.
<P>

I informed you that my client has made certain financial commitments in
reliance of completion taking place in accordance with the
terms of the
contract.  Despite the fact that the settlement period prescribed in the
contract was longer than the usual six weeks
your client only indicated to my
client that it might not be in a position to complete  a few days before the
prescribed completion
date.  One of the shareholders of the vendor company is
relying on funds to continue a building project.  If funds are not available
it
is possible that a breach of contract may occur with the builder.  The other
shareholder of the vendor company has entered into
an option.  If that option
cannot be exercised shortly my client has estimated that a lost opportunity in
the vicinity of $250,000.00
may occur.
<P>

I therefore wish to confirm that my client cannot grant a further extension of
time and that your client should urgently make financing
arrangements if indeed
this is not presently occurring." (Minter 12 May 1998 affidavit annexure "T" p.
42)
<P>

48   	On 12 March Mr Parker telephoned Mr Minter and a
conversation to the following effect took place:
<P>

PARKER:	"My client has applied for finance and shortly expects to give us
details."
<P>

MINTER:	"We would need something concrete if we are to consider anything.  You
will need to move extremely fast as my instructions
at this stage are that the
matter must be settled in accordance with the notice.  At the very least we
will require something very
specific indicating a clear possibility that the
matter will be settled shortly."
<P>

PARKER:	"I have told you that unless you are prepared to co-operate, we will be
forced to bring the Council out to the property."
<P>

MINTER:	"You still have not told me what is wrong with the property."
<P>

PARKER:	"Well for starter there is the awning which encroaches."
<P>

MINTER:	"If you telephone the South Sydney City Council they will tell you that
the awning has been approved and as late as 1995
the Council approved signage
of the awning."
<P>

PARKER:	"There is also the air-conditioner which encroaches"
<P>

MINTER:	"That is only a very small encroachment and you will remember that your
client asked for it to be thrown in just before
exchange as the tenant didn't
want to take it with it.  In any event, the air-conditioner is easily moved
without affecting its operability
or damaging it." (Minter affidavit 12 May
para 25)
<P>

49   	On 13 March Mr Hayes, through Carbest Pty Ltd received a
letter from Mercantile Mutual Funds Management Limited with respect
to a loan
application.  The application was to request a loan of a further $1.2 million
to Carbest in return for a mortgage over
the Mallet Street property.  It was
acknowledged in the letter from Mercantile Mutual Funds Management Limited
that:
<P>

"The purpose of the loan is to provide bridging finance for the acquisition of
the property at 156-168 Parramatta Road Camperdown
[the property at the heart
of these proceedings] until the present security property at Mallet Street is
sold.  A caveat is to be
lodged over the property at 156-158 Parramatta Road
Camperdown noting an interest as mortgagee for Terrace Guardians Limited.  A
mortgage will be taken over this property as well, in the unlikely event of the
sale of the Mallet Street security not proceedings."
(Hayes, affidavit 6 May
1998, annexure p 48)
<P>

50   	In a further letter dated 16 March 1998, the Defendant's
solicitors warned the Plaintiffs that if they did not comply with
the terms of
the Notice to Complete that the Defendant would issue a Notice of Termination.

<P>

51   	At no time before 16 March 1998 was the Plaintiff in a
financial position in which it could settle the Gogard contract.  At
that time
the final approval by Mercantile Mutual of the bridging finance arrangement had
not yet been given.
<P>

52   	On the afternoon of 16 March 1998 a telephone conversation
took place between the respective solicitors of the Plaintiff and
the
Defendant.  The conversation was, in part, to the following effect:
<P>

PARKER (Plaintiff's solicitor):	"Was not the loan approval on Friday
adequate?"
<P>

MINTER (Defendant's solicitor): "No. My clients would think it was three weeks
if not eight weeks late."
<P>

PARKER:	"You know why it was late, we had been attempting to put to you another
proposition regarding the other Camperdown development
which was subject to
Council approval."
<P>

MINTER:	"We all know the vagaries of Council approvals and you should not have
been relying solely on such an uncertain situation
to solve your problems. I
have told you on numerous occasions that if you have a proposition to put to
us, it should have been specific
as to details and certain as to time and
reasonably should be in writing. We have constantly received general statements
from you
regarding the efforts your client is making and against that
background my client would be circumspect about granting indulgences
at this
late state."
<P>

PARKER:	"But what is wrong with the loan approval?"
<P>

MINTER:	"I shouldn't have to tell you these things. The loan approval was
subject to a number of conditions and both of us know
that there are a great
many steps required before a full completion such as whether Land Tax has been
paid"
<P>

PARKER:	"No."
<P>

MINTER:	"Have all necessary enquires been sent out and received, what is the
Mercantile Mutual Credit Committee that needs to meet,
did a valuation of the
property have to be made, how long would it take?  All these sorts of questions
would need to be answered
if there was to be any certainty." (Minter 12 May
1998 affidavit para 27)
<P>

53   	The Defendant served a Notice of Termination dated 17
March 1998.
<P>

54   	On that day, the Plaintiff's solicitors, having received
the Notice of Termination, telephoned the Defendant's solicitor and
a
conversation took place, part of which was to the following effect:
<P>

PARKER	(Plaintiff's solicitor): "My client took a gamble in not having finance
ready but when they struck problems and we were not
prepared to extend the
settlement time, my client immediately organized its finances.  We now have a
conditional approval."
<P>

MINTER	(Defendant's solicitor): "None of this is our concern."
<P>

55   	54 Later in that conversation, the following exchange
occurred:
<P>

PARKER: 	"The finance approval represented certainty and settlement would take
place at the worst at the end of next week and at
best say, Monday"
<P>

MINTER: 	"This is not certainty.  We have no reason to know this will be the
case"
<P>

PARKER:	"Please let us know what your client wants."
<P>

MINTER:	"It is not for us to tell you what we want; at this stage the contract
must be considered terminated."
<P>

56   	The property was sold on or around 18 March 1998, for a
price of $1,500,000 to a third party.  The contract for that sale
was completed
on 15 June 1998.
<P>

57   	Mercantile Mutual Funds Management Limited approved the
bridging finance arrangement with Carbest Pty Ltd on 25 March 1998
[Hayes,
affidavit, 6 May 1998 annexure p 52].
<P>

58   	On or around 27 March 1998 Mr Hayes had a conversation
with Mr Wickham.  Mr Hayes contends that, at that meeting, Mr Wickham
represented to Mr Hayes that the deposit paid by the Plaintiff would be
returned.  Mr Wickham denies that any such representation
was made (Wickham
affidavit 29 May 1998 para 5).
<P>

59   	The Plaintiff's seek the return of the monies paid as
deposit on the purchase of the property to the Defendant. 
<P>

<b>The Legal Questions</b>
<P>

60   	The issues arising in this case can be stated as
follows:
<P>

1.	What was the completion date of the contract for sale of land executed by
the Plaintiff and the Defendant on the 4 December 1997?
<P>

2.	Was the Defendant entitled to issue a notice to complete on 27 February
1998?
<P>

3.	Was the Defendant entitled to terminate the contract?
<P>

4.	Is the Plaintiff entitled to be paid damages by the Defendant for breach of
the contract for the sale of the property?
<P>

5.	Is the Plaintiff entitled to a return of the deposit paid under the contract
of sale to the Defendant?
<P>

6.	Is the Defendant entitled to reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the
attempted sale?
<P>

61   	The Plaintiff argues that a completion date of 27 February
1997 was never a term of the Gogard contract.  Rather, it is contended
that the
term concluded by the parties was to the effect that the contract was to be
completed on a date that the parties agreed
on, but that the contract was to
include a nominal date for completion of 27 February 1997.
<P>

62   	The Plaintiff seeks rectification of the Gogard contract
in order to reflect the contended real agreement between the parties
that
completion would occur on a date agreed by them.
<P>

63   	As to the Notice to Complete, the Plaintiff contends that
the Defendant, according to clause 15 and clause 33 of the contract
for sale of
the property was never entitled to issue a Notice to Complete.  Any Notice to
Complete issued, therefore is said to be
ineffective.
<P>

64   	If as the Plaintiff contends, the Defendant was never
entitled to issue a Notice to Complete, a Notice of Termination could
never be
effective.
<P>

65   	In the circumstances, then, the Plaintiff says that it is
entitled to relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act </i>1919</a> and that the
deposit paid under the contract should be returned to the Plaintiff.
<P>

66   	Further, the Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant is not
entitled to its "reasonable costs and expenses" because the Gogard
contract
does not entitle it to such relief.
<P>

67   	In reply, the Defendant argues that the Gogard contract
accurately reflected discussions between the parties in respect of
the
completion date, namely that the contract was to be completed 27 February 1998.
This was a nominal date leaving completion for
whatever date was later agreed.
The Plaintiff failed to complete the contract on 27 February 1998 and the
Defendant is thus entitled
to issue a notice to complete on 27 February
1998.
<P>

68   	The Defendant also asserts that, by reason of the
Plaintiff's failure to comply within the time specified in the notice to
complete, the Defendant was entitled to serve a notice of termination on 17
March 1999.
<P>

69   	Further in reply, the Defendant argues that, pursuant to
clause 9 of the contract, the Defendant is entitled to retain the
deposit paid
under the contract together with its reasonable costs and expenses.
<P>

<b>Credit and Opinion Evidence</b>
<P>

70   	Before I deal with the issues of substantive argument, I
must address the credit of Mr Carruthers, Mr Wickham and Mr Hayes
and the
relevance and admissibility of the evidence given by Mr Williams.
<P>

<b><i>The Credit of Mr Carruthers</i></b>
<P>

71   	Counsel for the Plaintiff was given leave to make written
submissions with respect to the evidence given by Mr Carruthers,
Mr Wickham and
Mr Williams (T, 150/151.40).   The Plaintiff's written submissions in reply
outlines a number of reasons proffered
to the court in support of the
proposition that the evidence of those witnesses should not be accepted.
<P>

72   	There were four reasons given by the Plaintiff as to why
Mr Carruthers should not be believed. 
<P>

<b>Reason One</b>
<P>

73   	The Plaintiff first asserts that Mr Carruthers falsely
claimed to have relied on certain "telephone records" and "computer
records" in
the preparation of his affidavit of 12 May 1998. 
<P>

74   	The Plaintiff asserts that Mr Carruther's reference to his
practice of keeping file notes of telephone conversations "on most
occasions"
in paragraph 3 of his affidavit gives rise to only one possible inference,
namely, that the file notes were the only relevant
record he relied upon in
giving evidence.  But it is evident that Mr Carruthers did not solely rely on
the file notes in giving his
evidence and that he relied on his memory to a
degree.  That aside, the Plaintiff asserts that Mr Carruthers, in the course of
his
evidence, attempted to bolster his evidence by claiming to have relied on
two other forms of documentation and that in so claiming
was committing a
"blatant lie" (Plaintiff's written submissions in reply paras 4.1.4 &amp;
4.1.6).
<P>

75   	The first set of documents were "telephone records".
During the Plaintiff's cross-examination of Mr Carruthers, the following
exchange took place:
<P>

Q.	In your affidavit you say in paragraph 3 that you made file notes of
conversations as a director of Satnaq?
<P>

A.	That's correct.
<P>

Q.	Do you have any independent recollection of the events that transpired with
the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff's representative
in October, November, December
and through until March 1998?
<P>

A.	Yes I do.
<P>

Q.	So have you relied only on your file notes when you have reconstructed or
given your evidence of conversations that occurred
with Mr Spasevski, Mr Hayes
and Mr Wickham?
<P>

A.	I had made diary notes.  Also, all my telephone calls are logged, because I
am leaving the country and they are STD and they
have a time and also a date
when those calls are made and also on fax documentation. [T, 94:30]
<P>

76   	The STD records therein referred to by Mr Carruthers were
not annexed or referred to in his affidavit.  That those documents
were not so
annexed, however, does not give rise to the inference that they do not exist.
Furthermore, that they were not referred
to in paragraph 3 of Mr Carruther's
affidavit only suggests that it was not part of his practice so to log his STD
telephone calls.
<P>

77   	While it was asserted by the Plaintiff that the "telephone
records" were not cited in discovery, nor produced at any time,
the court has
before it no evidence in relation to the discovery nor of any notice to
produce.  Furthermore, the Plaintiff's assertion
that the issue was raised
earlier in the cross-examination and the existence of the "telephone records"
was not, at that point, referred
to is groundless (the Plaintiff refers to T,
92.5).  The matter was not sufficiently raised earlier in the
cross-examination.
<P>

78   	The Plaintiff's assertions cannot, therefore support the
inference that Mr Carruthers was lying in this respect.  This is
especially so
given that it was never put to Mr Carruthers that the telephone records did not
exist or that he did not rely on such
records.
<P>

79   	The second set of documents were "computer records".
During the cross-examination of Mr Carruthers, the following exchange
took
place:
<P>

Q.	Can you recall meeting with Mr Hayes, Mr Wickham and Mr Spasevski on 14
October?
<P>

A.	yes, I do.
<P>

Q.	That meeting is recorded in annexure D and also in your affidavit at
paragraph 11?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	I suggest to you that on this day you said to Mr Hayes the time is not a
problem with this sale, the contract will include a
provision for completion to
take place on 27 February 1998.  We can accommodate you for whatever time you
need to complete the purchase?
<P>

A.	That's not correct.
<P>

Q.	The only reference at annexure D, which is your diary note of 4 October, to
this meeting is the entry, I think, starts at 1:30
pm; do you see that?
<P>

A.	Yes, I see that.
<P>

Q.	You have recorded none of the event that you say transpired at that
meeting?
<P>

A.	No, I would have made notes when I went home.
<P>

Q.	Where are those notes?
<P>

A.	They would be at home on my computer because if you see down below I was
flying out at 3:05 on Qantas flight back to Armidale.
 I don't carry the
computer with me I take things home and put them straight on the computer.
<P>

Q.	When this affidavit was prepared and you swore it, you had been asked at the
time or shortly before it, to produce whatever records
you had of meetings you
referred to in the affidavit?
<P>

A.	Yes, that is correct.
<P>

Q.	Did you produce this record of the meeting from your computer?
<P>

A.	I gave a transcript of all my conversations and meetings, including
telephone bills which gave time, date and place to Robert
C Minter.
<P>

Q.	Are you saying you gave a copy of the computer record of this meeting to Mr
Minter?
<P>

A.	I did.
<P>

Q.	I put to you that there is no such record?
<P>

A.	I am sorry there is.
<P>

...
<P>

HIS HONOUR:	..."I think what counsel is asking you is when you put down  that
paragraph certain events, do you rely upon, for example,
this computer record
to assist your memory?
<P>

A.	Yes, I do.
<P>

Q.	In paragraph 3 [of your affidavit of 12 May 1998] there is no reference
there to reliance or a reliance upon computer records
in the preparing of this
affidavit or as a practice that you undertook as a director of Satnaq?
<P>

A.	I make all my references to my whole company on my computer.
<P>

Q.	Is there a lot of information, say, included on your computer or in files on
your computer that hasn't found its way to this
affidavit?
<P>

A.	No. (T, 101-2)
<P>

80   	No reference was made to the computer records in Mr
Carruthers' affidavit of 12 May 1998.  Mr Carruthers did rely on the computer
records to assist his memory of events.  The extent to which he did so is,
however, unclear.
<P>

81   	As previously mentioned, the court has no evidence before
it of what documents were cited in discovery nor of any notice to
produce.
Again, questions posed by counsel for the Plaintiff earlier in the
cross-examination (the Plaintiff relies on the question
at t, 92.5) did not
sufficiently raise the issue of computer records so as to make it relevant in
the current determination.
<P>

82   	The contentions on the Plaintiffs are far from sufficient
to support the assertion that Mr Carruthers lied with regard to
the existence
of the "computer records".
<P>

<b>Reason Two</b>
<P>

83   	The second reason to disbelieve the evidence of Mr
Carruthers proffered by the Plaintiff arises out of an inconsistency in
the
evidence given by Mr Carruthers and Mr Wickham:
<P>

"Mr Carruthers alleged during cross-examination that the Defendant had to "make
good" the property after the tenant (O'Briens Glass)
vacated on or around 24
December1997 and that this took a period of 20 to 40 days (t 101.10).
<P>

Mr Wickham refuted this and he gave evidence that making good required no great
effort on the Defendant's part and little or no
money  (T, 106.1)
<P>

Mr Carruthers acknowledge that Mr Wickham handled the finance (T, 89.55 &amp;
93.10), so it is to be presumed that Mr Wickham was
in a position to know what
the correct position was." [Plaintiff's written submissions in reply para
4.2]
<P>

84   	While this inconsistency goes to the weight or Mr
Carruthers' evidence on this point, it is not sufficient to support the
inference that Mr Carruthers deliberately lied about the matter.  The
inconsistency, then, does not effect the credit of Mr Carruthers.
<P>

<b>Reason Three</b>
<P>

85   	The third reason proffered by the Plaintiff going to the
credit of Mr Carruthers relates to the absence of Mr Spasevski during
the
hearing.  The Plaintiff asserts that Mr Spasevski, being the agent responsible
for selling the property to the Plaintiff on the
Defendant's behalf, could have
corroborated Mr Carruthers' evidence about:
<P>

4.3.2.1.	What offers he relayed to Mr Carruthers.
<P>

4.3.2.2.	What Mr Carruthers' instructions were and whether he (Spasevski) was
informed that an April 1998 settlement was not acceptable
(Carruthers affidavit
of 12/5/98 para 10); and
<P>

4.3.2.3.	Confirmed that the meeting held on 14 October1998 agreed that
settlement would occur in February 1998 (Carruthers affidavit
of 12/5/98 para
11)" [Plaintiff's written submissions in reply para 4.3.2]
<P>

86   	The Plaintiff submits that since Mr Spasevski did not give
evidence, "it must be presumed that his evidence would not have
assisted the
Defendant".
<P>

87   	The principle in <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 101 CLR 298</a>
is that where a party does not call a particular witness, generally an
inference may be drawn that the evidence, if called, would
not have assisted
the party's case.  Menzies J laid out the following principles with respect to
a person that has not been called:
<P>

1.	the absence of the person as a witness cannot be used to make up any
deficiency in the evidence.
<P>

2.	evidence which might have been contradicted by the witness can be accepted
more readily if the person fails to give evidence.
<P>

3.	where an inference is open from facts proved by direct evidence and the
question is whether it should be drawn, the circumstance
that the Defendant
disputing it might have proved the contrary had he chosen to give evidence is
properly to be taken into account
as a circumstance in favour of drawing the
inference: see <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> at 312 per Menzies J.
<P>

88   	For the principles in <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> to apply in
the present case, it must, then be shown that:
<P>

1.	If an inference is open from the facts proved;
<P>

2.	a party disputes the inference being drawn; and
<P>

3.	the party so disputing might have proved to the contrary by calling
evidence;
<P>

4.	the failure by that party to call the evidence can be taken into account in
favour of drawing the inference.
<P>

89   	The Defendant maintains that the conditions underlying the
principle in <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> have not been satisfied.
<P>

90   	It is correct to say that the "failure to call the
evidence does not of itself give rise to the inference" (see Defendant's
written submissions in reply para 12).  The Plaintiff does not elucidate the
inference or inferences which it is said can be drawn
from the established
facts.  While the Plaintiff's counsel have provided a list of matters upon
which Mr Sapveski could have, if
called, given evidence they do clarify the
inference sought.  It seems that the inference could be either that Mr
Carruthers was
lacking in credibility or that the evidence given by Mr
Carruthers was incorrect in respect of the matters to which Mr Spaveski could
give evidence.
<P>

91   	From the Plaintiff's written submissions it can be assumed
that the inference that the Plaintiff seeks to prove is that the
evidence of Mr
Carruthers should not be believed, especially in respect of three matters.  In
the alternative, the Plaintiff seeks
to infer that:
<P>

1.	certain offers were relayed to Mr Carruthers.
<P>

2.	That an April 1998 settlement was acceptable [see Carruthers affidavit 12
May 1998 para 10]
<P>

3.	That it was agreed at a meeting of 14 October1998 that settlement would
occur in February 1998 [see Carruthers affidavit 12 May
1998 para 11]
<P>

92   	The first inference is too vague to be `drawn' from the
evidence.  The Plaintiff has, however, adduced evidence to the court
with
respect to the date of settlement and meetings in which that date was
negotiated.
<P>

93   	If, then, there is some inference to be drawn from the
evidence it is clear that the Defendant wholeheartedly disputes the
inference
sought by the Plaintiffs.  Moreover it is in contradiction to the wording of
the contract.
<P>

94   	The third condition precedent to the application of the
principle in <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> is that Mr Spaveski would have, if called,
been able to shed light on the disputed inferences.  
<P>

95   	While this may or may not have been the case, the
Defendant correctly points out that if it were the case, there is no reason
proffered by the Plaintiff why Mr Spaveski could not have been called as a
witness by either party.  He was not in either "camp".
 I accept the
Defendant's submission that:
<P>

"There is no evidence that Mr Spaveski was under the control of the Defendant
at the time of the trial.  He was not and is not an
employee or consultant of
the Defendant."
<P>

96   	Mr Spaveski was acting as the agent for the vendor and
could have been called by either party.  The remaining question, then,
is
whether the `neutrality' of Mr Spaveski negates the role of the principle in
<i>Jones v Dunkel</i> in the present case.
<P>

97   	In <i>Payne v Parker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%201%20NSWLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 1 NSWLR 191</a>, the NSW Court
of Appeal was required to decide whether the trial judge in that case was in
error for not giving a <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> direction to the jury.  The case
involved an action in tort for damages arising out of the negligence of a
general practitioner said
to have occurred during an operation on the
Plaintiff's husband who, it was argued, died as a result of its negligent
execution.
 After the original operation and at the request of the general
practitioner, a specialist surgeon carried out three further operations
upon
the deceased.  Neither the general practitioner (being the Defendant) nor the
widow of the deceased (being the Plaintiff) called
the specialist surgeon as a
witness.  During the trial each counsel asked for a direction favourable to
their client in terms of
<i>Jones v Dunkel</i>.  The trial judge declined to
make any direction to the jury.
<P>

98   	Hutley JA wrote:
<P>

"A <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> direction should not be given, unless there is actual
evidence before the jury that the witness whose absence is to be the subject
of
comment is not available to the party seeking the benefit of inferences from
his absence.  Otherwise the opportunities for grave
injustice will be open.
There is a great difference in directing the jury, where a party, or a person
clearly under the control of
a party, is not called, and where the only basis
for inferring that a witness is not equally available is a jury's supposed
judicial
knowledge.  This, in many cases involving professions, merely gives
prejudice and suspicion full play".
<P>

99   	On the strength of this authority, the Defendant in the
present case maintains that the <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> principle is "not
applicable unless there is actual evidence that the witness whose absence is to
be the subject of comment is not
available to the party seeking the benefit  of
the inference" (Defendant's written submissions in reply para 12).  I agree the
failure
by the Defendant to call the evidence of Mr Spaveski cannot be taken
into account in favour of drawing the inference sought by the
Plaintiffs.
<P>

100   	Nor does the failure to call Mr Spaveski affect the
credit or reliability of the evidence given by Mr Carruthers.
<P>

<b>Reason Four</b>
<P>

101   	The Plaintiff finally mentions that Mr Carruthers has a
motive to lie:
<P>

"he receives a $300,000 bonus from doing so (i.e. the deposit of $134,750 plus
an enhanced purchase price of $152,500)" (Plaintiff's
written submissions in
reply, para 4.4)
<P>

102   	With respect to this assertion, I accept the submission
in reply made by counsel for the Defendant:
<P>

"The submission seems to be based on a premise that all parties have a motive
to lie, namely, in order to succeed in litigation."
(Defendant's written
submissions in reply para 13)
<P>

103   	I find the submission by the Plaintiff, therefore, not to
affect the weight of Mr Carruther's evidence.  I found him in fact
to be a
convincing witness and have no reason to doubt his evidence.
<P>

<b><i>The Credit of Mr Wickham</i></b>
<P>

104   	The Plaintiff's written submissions in reply suggested
seven reasons to reject "Mr Wickham's evidence".  While the Plaintiff
did not
specify what part of Mr Wickham's evidence should be rejected, it can be
assumed that the Plaintiff firstly means to raise
the issue of Mr Wickham's
credit generally and then the reliability of specific pieces of evidence that
form the subject of the seven
reasons proffered.
<P>

<b>Reason 1</b>
<P>

105   	The Plaintiff, by written submission, asserts that Mr
Wickham made a fraudulent claim with respect to money borrowed by the
Defendant
purportedly as a result of the Plaintiff's delay.  
<P>

106   	In his affidavit of 12 May 1998, Mr Wickham stated the
following:
<P>

"As completion of the Gogard Contract did not take place on 27 February 1998 it
has been necessary for Satnaq to extend and increase
the commercial bill
facility. ...  It was necessary for Satnaq to increase the commercial bill
facility as it has no income with
which to pay interest, land tax, water and
Council rates and other outgoings." (Wickham affidavit 12 May 1998 para 16)
<P>

107   	Counsel for the Plaintiff's asserts that Mr Wickham's
claim amounted to a "fraudulent claim" (Plaintiff's written submissions
in
reply para 5.1.4).  This assertion is made on flimsy grounds of alleged
inconsistencies between Mr Wickham's affidavit evidence
and other evidence at
trial.
<P>

108   	During cross-examination, Mr Wickham said that the reason
it was necessary to borrow the further $50,000 was that:
<P>

"we had distributed - we were distributing the money that was in there and to
be certain that we had the money there to cover outgoing
expenses, it was
prudent to do that because we weren't getting any more income from the rent."
(T, 105.20)
<P>

109   	The Plaintiff asserts that this evidence was inconsistent
with that given by Mr Carruthers during cross-examination.  As
to the further
$50,000 borrowed by Satnaq, Mr Carruthers said:
<P>

A.	Mr Wickham asked me and it would be in my diary, requesting that he could go
to the bank and request a further advance of $50,000
on the house that he was
redeveloping, or remodelling.
<P>

Q.	But that extra advance had nothing to do with the Plaintiff's failure to
settle on 16 March, is that right?
<P>

A.	Oh yes it did.
<P>

Q.	Why is that?
<P>

A.	Because he didn't have the money to pay off the loan he had and also to do
the remodelling. (T, 94.8-20)
<P>

110   	The inconsistency contended for by the Plaintiff does not
arise to a sufficient degree to suggest any impropriety on the
part of Mr
Wickham in his deposition.  While the documentary evidence does suggest that
between March 1998 and May 1998 there was
more than $50,000 dispersed from the
accounts of Satnaq, that is not germane to the credit of Mr Carruthers since he
at no time makes
an assertion otherwise.
<P>

111   	That the costs and expenses arising from the late sale of
the property may now no longer sought by the Defendants in cross-claim
does not
affect the credit of Mr Wickham.  That the Defendant no longer seeks those
amounts as due to it as a matter of legal right
cannot indicate that the facts
asserted by the Defendant are false in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
Furthermore, the allegation
of fraud was never directly put to Mr Wickham
during cross-examination.  
<P>

112   	In the circumstances, it is not appropriate to disbelieve
Mr Wickham's evidence on the strength of the first reason.
<P>

<b>Reason 2</b>
<P>

113   	The Plaintiff asserts that Mr Wickham made two false
claims with respect to the `reasonable costs and expenses'.  The false
claims
alleged were:
<P>

"5.2.2.1.	A claim for interest of $4,566.15 - interest that this was alleged to
have been incurred from 17 March 1998 to on or about
16 May 1998.  This
interest was paid on 16 March 1998 (affidavit of Allan Wickham of 16/6/98.
annexure "B").  The claim for interest
was based upon a bill facility of
$350,000 which was an inflated debt figure for the reasons set forward
above.
<P>

5.2.2.2.	A claim for legal costs of $2,092.63 that were allegedly incurred in
selling the Parramatta Road property.  The evidence
supporting this claim was
led by Mr Minter in an affidavit sworn on 16 July 1999 (annexure "B").
However, annexure "B" is titled
"Sale to Isabella Street Investments Pty
Limited" and it details Mr Minter's costs for the period between 16 March 1998
and 29 May
1998.  Clearly, this bill for legal fees had no connection
whatsoever with the Plaintiff's failure to complete the contract and would
have
been incurred in any event." (Plaintiff's written submissions in reply para
5.2).
<P>

114   	The claims referred to by the Plaintiff are contained in
the Defendant's Further Amended Cross-Claim.  Without here deciding
that the
Defendant is or is not entitled to the amounts claimed, that is not sufficient
evidence to suggest that the Defendant and
in particular Mr Wickham was
dishonest or engaging in deliberate falsehoods so to claim.  
<P>

<b>Reason 3</b>
<P>

115   	The third matter that the Plaintiff asks the court to
consider is that :
<P>

"Mr Wickham was allegedly an accountant and a lawyer (tp p 109.55).  However,
he was obviously not a person who bothered about detail
because he did not read
the contract for sale of land (tp p 117.15-35) and he could not remember what
the building sold for (tp p
118.45)." (Plaintiff's written submissions in reply
para 5.3.1)
<P>

116   	With respect to the contents and effect of the contract
for the sale of land, Mr Wickham did indicate that he retained a
conveyancing
solicitor (being Mr Minter) for the purpose of understanding the contract (T,
117.31).  That Mr Wickham himself did
or did not read the contract is of little
weight.  
<P>

117   	Further, although the transcript reveals that Mr Wickham
did misstate the price of the Gogard contract on one occasion (T,
119,.40), he
earlier did reasonable accurately recall the price (t, 118.40).  The
discrepancy between the two occasions is not such
as to raise doubts about Mr
Wickham's credit.  Furthermore, while Mr Wickham could not name the exact price
of the contract, in the
circumstances (namely, whereby Mr Carruthers was the
person primarily involved in negotiating the contract), the error is not such
as to cast doubt upon the Mr Wickham's evidence generally.
<P>

<b>Reason 4</b>
<P>

118   	The fourth reason why it is submitted by the Plaintiff
that the evidence of Mr Wickham not be accepted arises out of the
cross-examination of Mr Wickham, during which the following exchange
occurred:
<P>

"Q:	Did you keep any diary notes of things that happened in your business?
<P>

A:	Yes
<P>

Q.	Did you provide those diary notes to your solicitor to assist him in the
preparation of any of your affidavits?
<P>

A.	In reference to the assisting and preparing that affidavit, that is the way
I used them.  I didn't provide them to my solicitor.
<P>

Q.	Would you agree with me that you haven't referred to those notes or records
in any of your affidavits?
<P>

A.	These affidavits are mostly memory because I would in my diary strike a
meeting with so and so at a certain time.  I wouldn't
sit down and write a
transcript of what occurred at that meeting only in the event that I thought it
was contentious.
<P>

Q.	If you used these notes in paragraph 11 of [your affidavit of] 12 May, you
weren't able to say with certainty when the meeting
hat you referred to
occurred?
<P>

A.	Well, I don't believe I even put a note down for that date.  I had a note
down for the 12th but I believe, I understand that
the first day we were going
to have a meeting, that was cancelled for some reason or it was postponed so I
had to put an about date
down.
<P>

Q.	Do you have any of those notes now?
<P>

A.	I do.
<P>

Q. 	Where are they?
<P>

A.	They would be home.
<P>

Q.	You didn't think to bring them to Court?
<P>

 ...
<P>

Q.	You have had no need to refer to those notes since this case commenced on
Tuesday?
<P>

A.	What notes?
<P>

Q.	The notes you kept at meetings?
<P>

A.	I didn't keep notes of meeting unless it was a contentious issue and this
was a very preliminary meeting with a prospective purchaser.
<P>

Q.	What do you understand the word "contentious" to mean?
<P>

A.	In effect a problem of one sort or another. (T, 110)
<P>

119   	The Plaintiff asserts that there were a number of
contentious matters that were not the subject of written notes.  It was
never
put to Mr Wickham that he kept no notes at all and the fact that Mr Wickham
kept notes of some conversations and not others
does not necessarily infer that
no notes at all were kept.  Furthermore, that the contentious nature of the
conversations said by
the Plaintiff to necessarily be the subject of notes is
disputed by Mr Wickham (for example T, 110.48).
<P>

120   	In these circumstances it cannot sensibly be inferred
that Mr Wickham did not, in fact, keep any notes at all of any conversations
nor that he did not refer to notes in the preparation of his affidavit.
<P>

<b>Reason 5</b>
<P>

121   	The fifth reason allegedly going to the credit of Mr
Wickham is identical to the fourth reason put forward as against Mr
Carruthers
and warrants the same response.
<P>

<b>Reason 6</b>
<P>

122   	The Plaintiff alleges that:
<P>

"Mr Wickham has his "nose out of joint" when the building sold to the Defendant
for $1.347 million, because he thought that the
Plaintiff was getting "a very
good bargain" (T, 122.18).  However, his difficulty about the price was
relieved when the building
as sold for $1.5 million, as he regarded this as a
better price (T, 122.50)."
<P>

123   	This proposition was never put to Mr Wickham in
cross-examination.  Furthermore, the evidence does not suggest that Mr Wickham
did not agree to the price of $1.347 million.  That he believed Mr Hayes was
getting a "very good bargain" is no sufficient basis
for inferring that Mr
Wickham had a sufficient motive to be untruthful or that he did, in fact, give
a less than candid account of
what occurred.
<P>

<b>Reason 7</b>
<P>

124   	The seventh reason proffered by the Plaintiff in support
of the notion that Mr Wickham's evidence should not be believed
is the same in
substance to the third reason proffered as against the evidence of Mr
Carruthers and warrants the same response. 
It is not appropriate to infer that
the evidence of Mr Spaveski would not have assisted the Defendant's case.  The
<i>absence</i> of Mr Spaveski has no effect upon the credit of Mr Wickham or
the reliability of his evidence.
<P>

125   	I decline on any of these bases to discard the whole of
Mr Wickham's evidence.  Again I found him a convincing witness.
<P>

<b><i>The Evidence of Mr Williams</i></b>
<P>

126   	The comments made in the Plaintiff's Written Submissions
in Reply reveals the following alternative complaints:
<P>

1.	Mr Williams' evidence should not be admitted on the grounds that he had no
expertise or experience upon which he could base his
opinion evidence; or
<P>

2.	The evidence of Mr Williams has no relevance to the proceedings.
<P>

127   	The evidence in chief of Mr Williams was contained in his
affidavit of 22 September 1999.   Three paragraphs of that affidavit
were
objected to upon the Defendant seeking to adduce the evidence.  The Defendant
chose not to read one of the paragraphs subject
to objection.  The other
paragraphs the subject of objections were allowed into evidence on the basis
that the Defendant could deal
with the objection (which went to the form of the
paragraphs) in an oral examination in chief of Mr Williams.
<P>

128   	Mr Williams expressed an opinion in his affidavit about
the action that the Council would or would not (as he deposes) take
with
respect to the awning.  Mr Williams based his opinion on the fact that a
registered surveyor's report of 19 July 1956 showed
an awning of 3.66 metres
wide was sent to the council as part of an application to "cut back" the awning
and that the subsequent
plan of 16 February 1998 showed an awning of 3.1 metres
wide.  He also asserted that there was an unwritten "awning standard" with
which the awning, at around 3.1 metres wide, complied.  The Court was not
presented with any argument or evidence in support of an
argument that Mr
William's evidence as to the existence of an informal `awning standard' should
be disbelieved.  On the basis of
the facts available to Mr Williams, then, and
on the basis of his expertise as a District Building Assessor, evidence of Mr
William's
opinion as to whether the awning would have needed to be altered or
removed is not excluded by the opinion evidence rule. 
<P>

129   	As to relevance, Mr Williams does not represent the
position of South Sydney Council and could not purport to do so.  His
opinion,
based on his expertise, is capable, however of rationally affecting the
assessment of the probability of the existence of
facts in issue in the
proceeding and is therefore relevant.  The facts in issue are firstly, whether
the awning constituted a matter
that comes within paragraph 32 of the
Plaintiff's requisitions on title of 18 December1997.  The evidence also goes
to whether the
awning constituted a defect in title so as to be capable of
being the subject of a requisition on title.  These issues are discussed
below.

<P>

130   	Mr William's evidence is admissible.
<P>

<b><i>The Evidence of Mr Hayes</i></b>
<P>

131   	Mr Hayes was called by the Plaintiff.  The Defendant
contends that two pieces of evidence given by Mr Hayes should not be
accepted.
<P>

<b>Conversation with Mr Carruthers and Mr Wickham</b>
<P>

132   	At page 6 of his affidavit of 6 May 1998, Mr Hayes
attests that at a meeting of 10 October 1997 (this error was corrected
later in
the same affidavit), Mr Carruthers said:
<P>

Carruthers:	"We don't know what we have to do to the building once O'Brien's
are out. They may clean it.  We will negotiate with
them before we can commit.
Time is not a problem with this sale.  The contract will include a provision
that completion is to take
place on 27 February 1998.  We can accommodate you
for whatever time you need to complete the purchase."
<P>

Hayes:	"Good, that will suit the purchaser.  On that basis, the purchaser
should be able to exchange soon". (Hayes affidavit 6 May
1998 para 6)
<P>

133   	Mr Carruthers and Mr Wickham, who were also at the
meeting deny that any representation was made or conduct of the parties
capable
of grounding an inference that a settlement date later than 27 February 1998
was acceptable.  Mr Hayes could not point to
any documentary evidence to
support his claim.
<P>

134   	I find the evidence of Mr Hayes unconvincing on this
point.  In any case, as I decide below, the evidence is not enough to
support
the propositions of the Plaintiff that seek to rely on it.
<P>

<b>Conversation with Mr Parker</b>
<P>

135   	Mr Hayes maintains in his affidavit of 6 May that, in a
conversation with Mr Parker his solicitor on or around 19 November
1997, words
to the following effect were spoken:
<P>

Parker:	"Graham, I have received a contract for sale of the property at
Camperdown.  the contract provides that the completion date
is not to be later
than 27 February 1998.  Is this what you have negotiated."
<P>

Hayes:	"Don't worry about that.  The vendor has agreed that the time to
complete the contract will not be a problem." (Hayes affidavit
6 May 1998 para
8)
<P>

136   	This paragraph of Mr Hayes evidence was objected to by
the Defendant on the grounds that it was hearsay and not otherwise
relevant (T,
66.25).  The evidence was admitted on the basis that it was relevant for a
non-hearsay purpose, namely, that it went
to the state of mind of Mr Hayes
before the execution of the contract.
<P>

137   	The Defendant further submitted, in closing, that the
court should be cautious in accepting that the conversation ever took
place.
This contention is supported, the Defendant says, by two matters.  First, it
was conceded by the Plaintiff that Mr Parker,
the solicitor, did not make a
file note of the conversation.  It is contended that such an omission on the
part of a solicitor would
have been a serious oversight.  Secondly, Mr Parker,
although available to the Plaintiff as a witness was not called to give
evidence
in support of Mr Hayes' assertion.   It is proper here to draw the
<i>Jones v Dunkel</i> inference that Mr Parker's evidence on this point would
not have assisted the Plaintiff in seeking to convince the court that it
was
the intention of the parties to settle at some date other than 27 February
1998.
<P>

138   	In these circumstances, it is appropriate for court to
give little weight to the evidence of Mr Hayes in paragraph 8 of his
affidavit
of 6 May 1998 and certainly not such as to substantiate the inferences for
which the Plaintiff contends as against the
plain language of clauses 15 and 33
of the contract.  It is to that I now turn.
<P>

<b>Question One:  The Date of Completion</b>
<P>

139   	The first question to be dealt with is whether the
contract for sale should be rectified in order to reflect a completion
date now
contended for by the Plaintiffs.  The basis of the Plaintiff's claim for
rectification is that the contract executed on
4 December1997 does not
accurately reflect the agreement of the parties at that time.  No unilateral
mistake induced by unconscionable
behaviour on the part of the Defendant, nor
any other recognised ground for rectification has been argued.  The clause
sought to
be rectified is Special Condition 33 of the contract.
<P>

140   	Clause 15 and Special Condition 33 of the contract deal
with the completion date.  Clause 15 states:
<P>

<b>"15	Completion date</b>
<P>

The parties must complete by the completion date and, if they do not, a party
can serve a notice to complete if that party is otherwise
entitled to do so."
[PX5 6]
<P>

141   	Special Condition 33 of the contract for sale provided
that the completion date was not later than 27 February 1998.  Special
Condition 33 reads:
<P>

<b>"Clause 33 	Completion</b>
<P>

33.	The completion date is not later than 27 February 1998.  The property
shall, on the completion date be delivered to the purchaser
in a clean and tidy
condition." [PX5 12]
<P>

142   	The rectification contended for by the Plaintiff was set
out in the first prayer of the summons.
<P>

143   	The clause contended for initially by the Plaintiff was
to the effect that the completion date would be 27 February 1998
or, in the
alternative, a date that was agreed by the parties.  However, since it was
evident that no agreement had been reached
between the parties as to an
alternative completion date, the rectification contended for did not help the
Plaintiff.
<P>

144   	After being given leave to amend its summons, the
Plaintiff reformulated the rectification sought.  The rectification now
contended for is contained in the first prayer of the Further Amended Summons.
It is argued that Special Consideration 33 should
read:
<P>

"The contract is to be completed on a date agreed by the parties.  A nominal
date for completion is 27 February 1998 but if the
contract is not completed by
this date, it is to be completed within a reasonable time of this date, which
date is to be convenient
and suitable to both parties."
<P>

145   	The Defendant contends, in opposition to the
rectification that the rectification sought by the Plaintiff is uncertain in
its terms and should therefore not be allowed.
<P>

146   	The factual matters going to the matter of rectification
are as follows.
<P>

147   	Mr Hayes, a consultant and principal to the Plaintiff
took part in discussions with Mr Wickham and Mr Carruthers of the Defendant
in
late 1997 with respect to the prospective sale of the property.
<P>

148   	By 30 September 1997 Mr Carruthers of the Defendant had
turned his mind to the completion date.  A diary note of that date
notes that a
suggestion for settlement in April as "too long". [Carruthers affidavit 12 May
1998 annexure C, p 15]
<P>

149   	On 14 October1997, Mr Hayes met with Mr Carruthers and Mr
Wickham to discuss the contract of sale.  Mr Hayes maintains that,
at that
meeting, it was agreed that the date of completion was "able to be later than
27 February 1998" (T, 74.25).  He deposes that
the content of that discussion
included a conversation to the following effect:
<P>

"Hayes:	"The Plaintiff will not be able to settle the sale until at least the
end of April 1998."
<P>

Carruthers:	"We need to settle earlier than that.  O'Brien's Glass will be out
at the end of January, maybe February.  Can you pay
rent until settlement?"
<P>

Hayes:	"I don't think that is appropriate?"
<P>

Carruthers:	"What about the end of February?"
<P>

Hayes:	"May be.  It depends on other settlements.  Gogard probably needs until
the end of March, at least?"
<P>

Carruthers:	"We don't know what we have to do to the building once O'Brien's
are out.  They may clean it.  We will negotiate with
them before we can commit.
Time is not a problem with this sale.  The contract will include a provision
that completion is to take
place on 27 February 1998.  We can accommodate you
for whatever time you need to complete the purchase."
<P>

Hayes:	"Good, that will suit the purchaser.  On that basis, the purchaser
should be able to exchange soon"." (Hayes, affidavit 6
May 1998, para 6)
<P>

150   	Mr Hayes could not point to any documentary evidence to
support his claim (T, 74.55).  Mr Carruthers and Mr Wickham deny
that there was
any agreement to complete on a date other than 27 February 1998.
<P>

151   	Mr Hayes also recalls a conversation with his solicitor,
Mr Parker on or around 19 November1997 to the following effect:
<P>

PARKER:	"Graham, I have received a contract for sale of the property at
Camperdown.  The contract provides that the completion date
is not to be later
than 27 February 1998.  Is this what you have negotiated?"
<P>

HAYES:	"Don't worry about that.  The vendor has agreed that the time to
complete the contract will not be a problem".[Hayes affidavit,
6 May 1999 para
8]
<P>

152   	While as I have said this statement was subject to an
objection on the basis of hearsay, it was admitted into evidence on
the grounds
that it could be used for a non-hearsay purpose.  That purpose, in this
instance, is to demonstrate that it was the belief
on behalf of Mr Hayes that
the completion date was somewhat flexible.  The solicitor, Mr Parker did not
make a file note of this
conversation and he was not called to give that
evidence himself.  It should be given no weight in the circumstances.
<P>

153   	Evidence from Mr Minter, the Defendant's solicitor
suggests rather that there was no agreement as contended for by Mr Hayes
and
the Plaintiff.  A letter of 14 November1997 from Mr Carruthers to Mr Minter
outlining the salient points of the draft contract
for sale of the property
names the settlement date as 27 February 1998 [Minter affidavit 12 May 1999
annexure A, p12A].  Further,
a file note of a conversation between Mr Minter
and Mr Parker of 14 November1997 does not mention any agreement to the effect
that
the date of settlement could be some other date convenient to the parties
as asserted by the Plaintiff [Minter affidavit 12 May 1998
annexure A1, p12B].
A conversation of 28 November1997 between the Plaintiff's solicitor and the
Defendant's solicitor similarly contained
no discussion as to a variation of
the settlement date earlier canvassed (Minter affidavit 12 May 1998 para 7).
<P>

154   	Mr Hayes admitted that the solicitor to the vendor had
nominated 27 February 1998 as the date of completion and that there
was a real
need to complete the contract before that date (T, 76.30-40).  For example, the
letter of 25 February 1998 from the Plaintiff's
solicitor to the Defendant's
solicitor contains the words:
<P>

"We acknowledge your client's refusal to consider our request for an extension
of time to complete and in this regard are instructed
to request that your
client re-consider its position". (Minter affidavit 12 May 1998 annexure "O"
p.34)
<P>

155   	Nowhere in that letter is asserted a contractual right on
the part of the Plaintiff or even an informal mutual understanding
to complete
after 27 February 1998.  While it may be true to say that the Plaintiff never
expressly represented that it would be
in a position to complete as at 27
February 1998 (see Plaintiff's written submissions in reply para 11.1.1 p. 9),
the absence of
such a representation does not speak to the intention of the
parties being anything other than what is recorded in the express words
of the
contract.
<P>

156   	A final matter going to rectification is the content of
Special Condition 35.  That clause reads:
<P>

<b>35	Interest for late completion</b>
<P>

Without limiting any other right of the vendor, if completion of this contract
takes place after the Completion date it is an essential
term of this contract
that, on completion, the purchaser must pay interest to the vendor calculated
on the unpaid balance of the
price at the rate of 8% per annum on a daily basis
from but not including the Completion date and including the date on which this
contract is completed.  The purchaser need not pay interest for any period
where the delay in completing is caused by the vendor.
 [PX5 13]
<P>

157   	Special Condition 35 does contemplate completion after
the Completion date.  This is not, however, relevant to deciding that
there was
a date prescribed for completion or that the Defendant (the vendor) was
entitled (assuming it had otherwise complied with
the contract) to complete on
or after 27 February 1998.  Of particular importance in reaching this
conclusion are the words "without
limiting any right of the vendor".
<P>

158   	Rectification is the process by which the Court reforms
an instrument in which the parties have `mistakenly' recorded their
agreement.
Courts "rectify instruments purporting to have been made in pursuance of the
terms of contracts.": <i>McKenzie v Coulson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281869%29%20LR%208%20Eq%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1869) LR 8 Eq 368</a> at 375 per
James V-C. Courts do not rectify underlying agreements that are expressed in
documentary form save as set out below: 

<P>

159   	In the present case it is necessary for the Plaintiff to
prove that the underlying agreement between the parties was not
accurately
recorded in the contract instrument on the date that it was executed, namely,
on 4 December1997.  The question before
the court, then, is whether, at the
time the contract document was executed, the intention of the parties was
accurately recorded
in that contract or alternatively whether their intentions
conformed with the words of the rectification contended for.
<P>

160   	In an attempt to delineate the various categories of
case, Dr Spry puts the position thus (Spry, I.C.F., "The Principles
of
Equitable Remedies", 5th edition, (LBC Information Services, 1997), 611-2:
<P>

"The simplest cases in which a mistake arises are found where a provision that
is intended to be included is inadvertently omitted
or where there is an
inadvertent inclusion of an unintended provision or where a provision is
inadvertently mis-expressed.  In all
of these cases rectification may, where
appropriate, be ordered.
<P>

.....
<P>

A more difficult case arises where the parties are aware of the precise terms
of the relevant part of the document but misapprehend
their effect.  Here it
appears to be necessary to distinguish between two positions.  The first
position occurs where the concurrent
intention, that is, the intention that the
document is desired to effectuate remains the dominant and governing intention.
In this
event it should not matter that the precise terms of the document have
been seen by the parties, and rectification, where otherwise
appropriate,
should be ordered.  So it has been said by Brightman J., "Furthermore,
rectification is available not only in a case
where particular words have been
added, omitted or wrongly written as a result of careless copying or the like.
It is also available
where the words of the document were purposely used but it
was mistakenly considered that they bore a different meaning from their
correct
meaning as a matter of true construction" : In re Butlin's Settlement Trusts
[1976] Ch.251 at 260 per Brightman J.  The second
position arises where the
parties, whatever their previous intention may have been, have ceased to retain
that intention as their
governing intention and have formed instead an
intention to be bound by the precise terms of the document in question,
regardless
of possible discrepancies between its provisions and prior or other
intentions on their part.  In this event rectification is not
appropriate":
Spry, Equitable Remedies 1997, p. 611-2
<P>

161   	Were the Plaintiff's contention correct, this case would
only fall within Spry's `more difficult' category of cases.  The
conversations
of 14 October1997, 14 November and 19 November 1997 and the admissions of Mr
Hayes (T, 76.30-40), without more and
in the absence of assertion otherwise,
lead to the conclusion that the principals of the Plaintiff were aware that a
term in the
contract of 4 December nominated 27 February 1998 as the completion
date.  Furthermore, the letter of 14 November 1997 from Mr Carruthers
to Mr
Minter reveals the Defendant's knowledge of that contract would state that it
be completed on 27 February 1998.  The Plaintiff's
case in rectification, then,
rests at its highest on the argument that at the time the written contract was
executed, the parties
shared a common intention that the agreement would
operate in a manner at odds with the express terms of the instrument purporting
to express that agreement.
<P>

162   	In <i>Westland Savings Bank v Hancock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%202%20NZLR%2021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 2 NZLR
21</a>, Tipping J followed accepted authority to decide that, for a Court to
rectify a written instrument, it must be established that the
parties held a
single corresponding intention on  the point in question right up to the moment
of execution of the instrument: at
26.  His Honour, after considering the
Australian position, considered that outward expression of that common
intention is not necessary
before rectification can be contemplated.  Tipping J
(at 30) decided that:
<P>

"... before rectification can be ordered the Court must be satisfied that the
following points are established: [30]
<P>

(1)	That, whether there is an antecedent agreement or not, the parties formed
and continued to hold a single corresponding intention
on the point in
question.
<P>

(2)	That such intention continued to exist in the minds of both or all parties
right up to the moment of execution of the formal
instrument of which
rectification is sought.
<P>

(3)	That while there need be no formal communication of the common intention by
each party to the other or outward expression of
accord, it must be objectively
apparent from the words or actions of each party that each party held and
continued to hold an intention
on the point in question corresponding with the
same intention held by each other party.
<P>

(4)	That the document sought to be rectified does not reflect that matching
intention   but would do so if rectified in the manner
requested": <i>Westland
Savings Bank v Hancock</i> at.29-30 per Tipping J
<P>

163   	Tipping J quotes Street J in <i>Australasian Performing
Rights Association Limited v Austarama Television Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 NSWLR
467</a> (approved by Menzies J in <i>Hooker Town Developments Pty Ltd v Director of
War Service Homes</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2047%20ALJR%20320" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 47 ALJR 320</a>, 323-324):
<P>

"It seems rather that the true principle involves finding an identical
corresponding contractual intention on each side, manifested
by some act or
conduct from which one can see that the contractual intention of each party met
and satisfied that of the other. 
On such facts there may be seen to exist
objectively a consensual relationship between the parties" :  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 NSWLR 467</a>
at 473.
<P>

164   	The Plaintiff, on the strength of this authority, argues
that since the doctrine of rectification requires no outward expression
of the
accord antecedent to the written agreement, rectification is appropriate in
this case.  The Plaintiff has, however failed
to establish on the balance of
probabilities nor to the level of "convincing proof" (see <i>Joscelyne v
Nissen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%202%20QB%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 2 QB 86</a> at 98) that the common intention of the parties as at
4 December1997 was anything other than that recorded in the written contract
executed on that date.  In <i>Westland Savings Bank v Hancock</i> (supra), the
evidence suggested that the parties shared a common intention even in the
absence of outward expression:
<P>

"While there may not have been any formal communication by each to the other of
such intention, the [Plaintiff] clearly demonstrated
such intention by the
terms of the loan offer and its actions subsequent to the signing of the
mortgage.  The [Defendants] demonstrated
their identical intention by taking
the loan offer to their solicitor and instructing him to proceed in terms of
it": <i>Westland Savings Bank v Hancock</i> at.30
<P>

165   	No similar factual scenario exists in the current case.
To the contrary, it can be firmly stated that the vendor at no time
"acted as
if the document stood in the form into which it is sought to be rectified":
compare <i>Westland Savings Bank v Hancock</i> at 31.
<P>

166   	The Plaintiff's case for rectification is not made out;
issues of uncertainty do not arise.
<P>

<b>Question Two:  The Notice to Complete</b>
<P>

167   	The Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the notice to
complete issued on 27 February 1998 is not valid.  The notice was issued
in
purported pursuance of Clause 15 and Special Condition 34 the contract of sale
which I have earlier quoted.
<P>

168   	Having decided that date for completion of the contract
was 27 February 1998, it is not in dispute that the contract was
not completed
in accordance with clause 15.  While it is disputed by the Plaintiff that the
Defendant was free of relevant default
when giving the notice and that the
Defendant was able, ready and willing to proceed to completion, no argument is
made as to the
reasonableness of the time fixed by the notice.  In the absence
of any argument on behalf of the Plaintiff to that effect, I find
that the date
nominated by the notice to complete, being 16 March 1998 did provide the
Plaintiff with reasonable time in which to
complete the contract.  Furthermore,
the valid form of the notice is not in dispute.
<P>

169   	The notice to complete is not, therefore, challenged
except on the following grounds:
<P>

1.	that the Defendant vendor was not free of relevant default when giving the
notice;
<P>

2.	that the Defendant vendor was not able ready and willing to proceed to
completion at the time the notice was issued.
<P>

170   	It is the Plaintiff's case that there were, existing at
the time that the contract was to be settled, encroachments onto
adjoining
lands.  The encroachments alleged are a party wall, an external air
conditioning unit and an awning extending over a public
footpath.  The
encroachments were not, it is alleged, disclosed in the express terms of the
contract.
<P>

171   	The Plaintiff argues that the "non-disclosed
encroachments" amounted to breaches of contract and disentitled the Defendant
to issue a notice to complete under clause 15 of the contract.  
<P>

172   	It is the Defendant's position that the mere fact there
may be a possible defect in title does not mean there is a breach
of contract
disabling the Defendant from completion (T, 163.30).  The Plaintiff's case can
only succeed, it is argued, if there is
established a failure on the part of
the vendor to answer requisitions properly issued by the purchaser.
<P>

173   	The questions to be answered with respect to the notice
to complete, then, are:
<P>

1.	Was there any failure on the part of the Defendant to answer properly issued
requisitions?
<P>

2.	If the answer to the first question is "No", is there any other matter, such
as a defect in title or non-compliance with the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lga182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a></i> as
would disqualify the Defendant from issuing a notice to complete?
<P>

174   	If the questions are both answered in the negative, the
conclusion must be that the notice to complete was validly issued
by the
Defendant.
<P>

<b>That the vendor was in default:  failure to answer requisitions</b>
<P>

175   	Regardless of whether failure to properly answer
requisitions on the part of the vendor constitutes a breach of the contract
for
the sale of land, it is generally the case that a vendor cannot issue a notice
to complete unless it has fulfilled its obligations
with regard to any
properly-issued requisitions:  <i>Neeta (Epping) Pty Limited v Phillips</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20131%20CLR%20286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 131 CLR 286.</a>
<P>

176   	There were two sets of `requisitions' issued by the
purchaser.  The first set was issued on 18 December1997.  These requisitions
were answered by the vendor on 14 January 1998.  The second set of
`requisitions' was issued on 25 February 1998.  The 25 February
`requisitions'
were never answered by the vendor.  The vendor Defendant, however, argues,
firstly, that the 25 February `requisitions'
were made out of time according to
the terms of the contract; and secondly, that they did not otherwise constitute
valid requisitions
according to the terms of the contract.  I start with the
first test.
<P>

<b>Requisitions of 18 December1997</b>
<P>

177   	On 18 December1997 the Plaintiff's solicitors sent a list
of requisitions to the Defendant's solicitors.  The 18 December1997
requisitions were answered on 14 January 1998.  The Plaintiff contends that the
answers to the 18 December requisitions were not
sufficient so as to discharge
the vendor's duty arising from the contract of sale.  It is thus contended that
the 18 December requisitions
were not properly answered and that, therefore the
Defendant was not entitled to issue the notice to complete.  
<P>

178   	The vendor's duty to answer requisitions is summarised
thus:
<P>

"... the vendor, by settled conveyancing practice, is bound, within [some]
limits..., to answer not only requisitions and objections
to title but also all
relevant questions put to him by the purchaser in respect of the subject
property or the title thereto": Stonham,
The Law of Vendor and Purchaser para
1009, at 507
<P>

179   	The limits mentioned by Stonham are as follows.
Questions are "relevant" when they concern 
<P>

(a)	the ability of the vendor to carry out its obligations under the contract;

<P>

(b)	matters which, having regard to the terms of the contract, must be dealt
with on completion of the transaction; 
<P>

(c)	information as to the rights apart from matters of title, which the
purchase may or will acquire and as to the obligations to
which it may or will
become subject, on becoming the owner of the property sold (including rights in
respect of party walls); 
<P>

(d)	matters affecting the nature, quality, use or value of the property; or 
<P>

(e)	any other matters which might be a ground for equitable relief (for
example, as a defence to a suit for specific performance):
at para 110, p.507.

<P>

As to the nature of the answer that must be given by the vendor:
<P>

"... the vendor is only bound to answer such general inquiries as to his own
knowledge or as to matters within his knowledge or
from documents or records
within his possession, or that of his servants or agents; and he is not bound
to inquire elsewhere for
the purposes of furnishing the purchaser with
information.  Where the vendor has no such knowledge, the proper answer to such
an
inquiry is that the vendor is not aware, and it may be appropriate, in some
circumstances, to add that the purchaser ought to make
further inquiries on his
own behalf; but it is not appropriate to answer that the purchaser must rely
upon his own inquiries where
the vendor has some knowledge because the
purchaser is entitled to an answer, within the limits already mentioned.":
Stonham, The
Law of Vendor and Purchaser Sydney: LBC 1964  1011, p. 508
<P>

180   	Then there is the use to which the vendor's
representations in answer to requisitions may be put:
<P>

"The vendor must answer even though the answer confers no rights under the
contract upon the purchaser; but it must not be supposed,
because an answer
discloses something, which is or may be detrimental to the purchaser, by reason
of exposing him to some obligation
or claim, that the purchaser is necessarily
entitled to compel the vendor to remove the detriment or to some other
relief... He has
no remedy unless the matter is something which <b>relates to
title</b>, or <b>some other matter for which the vendor is liable by the terms
of the contract</b>, or confers <b>some right or remedy upon the purchaser in
accordance with equitable principles</b> relating to the enforcement of
contracts for the sale of land and the adjustment of rights between the
parties.": Stonham, "The Law
of Vendor and Purchaser", para 1011, p. 508-9 [my
emphasis]
<P>

181   	It is clear that a vendor has an obligation to answer
requisitions properly issued to the extent of the vendor's knowledge.
 With
respect to the requisitions of 18 December1997, there is no dispute that they
were properly to be called requisitions and were
otherwise validly issued by
the Plaintiff.  I will deal with each of the contentious requisitions in turn
in determining whether
the Defendant vendor has discharged such duty.
<P>

182   	Paragraph 11 of the 18 December1997 requisitions
states:
<P>

"11.(a)	Is the Vendor in possession of a Survey Report in respect of the
subject property, and, if so, is he prepared to hand it
over at settlement?
<P>

(b)	Subject to Contract Survey should result satisfactorily and show that the
whole of the land is available to the Purchaser and
that there is no
encroachment by or upon the subject property." [PX5 45]
<P>

183   	The Plaintiff contends that the "Survey" referred to in
requisition 11(b) refers to any survey carried out over the subject
land.  It
is not restricted, the Plaintiff says, to the survey referred to in 11(a).  The
Plaintiff argues, then that the answer
given to requisition 11(b), being
"noted", opens the door to any future survey revealing an encroachment upon the
property to be
considered part of the original requisition.  It was put to the
Plaintiff that the capital "S" in "Survey" as written in requisition
11(b)
suggested that it referred to the same survey as was mentioned in requisition
11(a).  The Plaintiff submitted that while the
use of a capital "C" in
"Contract" used in the requisition was employed in order to refer to the
contract for the sale of the subject
property, the use of a capital "S" in
"Survey" was not employed to refer to any specific survey.  That submission is
internally inconsistent.
 
<P>

184   	The use of capital letters in the phrase "Contract
Survey" suggests to the reader that the requisition is referring to a
specific
survey, namely, the survey referred to in paragraph (a) of that requisition.
Having answered "No" to paragraph (a), the
Defendant need not answer paragraph
(b) in a definitive manner.  
<P>

185   	The answer given to the requisition at clause 11 is,
therefore, sufficient and does not constitute a breach of contract on
the part
of the Defendant.
<P>

186   	Requisition 12(b) of the requisitions of 16 December1997
reads:
<P>

"Are there any <b>building or other restrictions or any easement or other
similar rights</b> (including rights-of-way, drainage, light, air etc.)
affecting or appurtenant to the property sold <b>not disclosed by the
particulars of sale, the abstract of particulars of title or the replies to the
above requisitions</b>?  If so, please give particulars. [PX5 45] [emphasis is
mine]
<P>

187   	The answer given to this requisition was "No" [PX5 48].
While it is not made clear by the Plaintiff, it appears that the
Plaintiff
contends that an easement for support existed and was not disclosed "by the
particulars of sale, the abstract of particulars
of title or the replies to the
above requisitions".  The easement was not disclosed in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act</i> 1979</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s149(2)</a> certificate attached to the
contract of sale.  However, the existence of a registered easement for support
was disclosed by the Defendant
in the 14 January answers to the requisitions in
the answer to clause 21 of the requisitions.  The use of the word "above" in
paragraph
12(b) does not dissuade me from the view that the easement was
disclosed to the purchaser.
<P>

188   	The requisition at clause 12(b) was, therefore,
sufficiently answered.
<P>

189   	Requisition 32 reads:
<P>

"32.	Is/are the vendor/s aware of <b>any matters which may detrimentally affect
the value or amenity of the property</b> or the purchaser's use or enjoyment
thereof including but without restriction, any notices from any person or
government body or
any proposals to build upon or carry out any works or
conduct any activities upon any surrounding properties (including any formal
development or building applications relating to such surrounding properties)
or any other physical defects in the subject property?
[my emphasis] [PX5
47]
<P>

190   	The answer given to this requisition was "No" [PX5 49].

<P>

191   	The Plaintiff maintains that the party wall, the air
conditioning unit and the awning were all physical defects of the subject
property.  It is argued, however, that the `defects' complained of do not have
any detrimental effect on the value or amenity of
the property.  
<P>

192   	The question to ask, according to the terms of the
requisition is not whether the contested encroachments constitute defects
in
title. Rather, it is whether they "detrimentally affect the value or amenity of
the property".  Physical defects in title, or
other matters referred to in
paragraph 32 are not the subject of the requisition unless they detrimentally
affect the value or amenity
of the property.
<P>

193   	With respect to the party wall, it is clear from the
survey documents that there are encroachments by the wall on either
side of the
boundary line.  Any latent claim attaching to the subject property on the part
of the adjoining land holder could be
offset by a corresponding claim against
the holder of that adjoining land balancing each other out.  There thus can be
no relevant
affectation of the value or amenity of the property. 
<P>

194   	It is also clear that even were the party wall
encroachment a `defect' potentially within paragraph 32, it would have been
readily curable after sale by means which refute any detrimental affectation to
value or amenity.  That is, in fact, what appears
to have occurred.  The third
party purchasers of the property have since registered a plan showing the
encroachment complained of
and have, by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88bb.html" class="autolink_findacts">s88BB</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act</i> 1919</a> (NSW), thus created an easement, curing any defect caused by the
encroachment (Souter, affidavit 16 September 1999 para 20). The
plan was
registered on 22 April 1999.
<P>

195   	The party wall, therefore, does not come within the words
of requisition 32.
<P>

196   	Similarly, the encroachment by the air conditioning unit
could have been cured without detrimental affectation to value or
amenity by
removing the unit from the wall and placing it inside the building.  As of 27
February this had not occurred.  However,
while the air conditioning unit may
be capable of being described as an encroachment according to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/eoba235/" class="autolink_findacts">Encroachment of Buildings Act</a></i>, it cannot reasonably be said to
detrimentally affect the value or amenity of the property.
<P>

197   	With regard to the awning, it is necessary to have
reference to the evidence of Mr Williams.  I have dealt with the admissibility
of Mr William's evidence above.  
<P>

198   	It was given in evidence by Mr Williams that the council,
at the time of completion would not have required the owner of
the property to
remove or otherwise alter the awning [Williams affidavit 22 September 1999 para
6].  The evidence of Mr Williams
suggests that even though, at the time of
sale, there may not have been any infringement of council policy arising from
the awning,
the policy that determined infringement could be changed by the
council at any time [T, 161.30].  
<P>

199   	Further to Mr William's evidence, a certificate issued
pursuant to s172 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</i> 1993</a> was issued on 4 May
1998.  The document certifies that the Council will not take proceedings in
relation to any encroachment by the
building or part onto land vested in or
under the control of the Council (such as the awning).
<P>

200   	The point raised by the Plaintiff is that, while the
Defendant has proved that after 4 May 1998 the awning could not properly
be
said to come within paragraph 32, nonetheless at any time until the issue of
the s172 certificate, the awning remained a matter
"which may detrimentally
affect the value or amenity of the property".
<P>

201   	The situation that we are faced with, then, is the
following.  The Defendant has answered "No" to a requisition while not
having
the requisite knowledge so to answer.  That is, there has been no evidence to
suggest that the Defendant inquired of the council
their attitude to the awning
before issuing the notice to complete.  As it turns out, however, on the
evidence, the Defendant's answer
has been vindicated by subsequent events.
Without the evidence of Mr Williams, then, it is unlikely that "No" would have
constituted
a proper answer to the requisition.  The evidence of Mr Williams,
however, changes the matter.  On the basis of Mr Williams' opinion
evidence, it
can be said that it was, at all material times, the case that the awning did
not constitute a matter "which may detrimentally
affect the value or amenity of
the property".  Does the fact that it was possible that the situation could
change, due to Council
minute or ordinance, any time until 4 May 1998 make the
answer "No" an insufficient one?
<P>

202   	It was at least true to say that no notice pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s124.html" class="autolink_findacts">s124</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act </i>1993</a> had been issued by South Sydney
Council requiring that the awning be altered or removed.  Was it the duty of
the vendor to alert
the purchaser, then, that such a notice <i>may</i> be
issued in the future?  The use of the word "may" in paragraph 32 of the
requisitions does make the requisition one of some breadth.
 But it is not
rendered of such scope as to bring with its ambit speculative consequences of
no demonstrated likelihood.  The requisition
could not validly require of the
vendor in answer, to speculate as to what may, in the future affect the value
of the property. 
It is conceivable that all manner of things could then come
within the scope of the requisition at paragraph 32.  I therefore find
that the
answer "no" to the requisition at paragraph 32 was sufficient and proper with
respect to the awning.
<P>

203   	Requisition 32 was, then, properly answered.
<P>

<b><i>The Submission Ruled Inadmissible</i></b>
<P>

204   	During final oral submissions, the court was referred to
paragraph 21 of the requisitions of 18 December1997.  The submission
was
objected to on the grounds that it was not revealed as a ground for complaint
by the Summons, the opening submissions or subsequently
in the trial until that
point.  This court ruled at that time that the final submission with respect to
paragraph 21 was inadmissible.
<P>

205   	In the Plaintiff's Written Submissions in Reply, counsel
for the Plaintiff seeks to re-agitate the issue.  The Plaintiff
cites in
support of this application, "Halsbury's Laws Of England" 3rd ed Vol 3 at
69:
<P>

"The object of the opening address is to give the jury a general notion of what
will be given in evidence.  Counsel in opening states
the facts of the case,
the substance of the evidence he has to adduce and its effect on proving his
case and remarks upon any point
of law involved".
<P>

206   	The Plaintiff maintains that this supports the assertion
that there is no legal basis to prevent evidence that was not specifically
identified in an opening from being led and then raised in submissions.
Further, the contention is made by the Plaintiff, that what
cannot be referred
to in submissions is a matter that has not been properly introduced into
evidence.
<P>

207   	The paragraph of Halsbury's Laws cited by the Plaintiff
does not help its case at this point.  It is not material that the
evidence
necessary for the Plaintiff to prove its submission had been admitted as
relevant to other points raised in the summons
and the opening.  It is in the
interests of fairness and the orderly conduct of trials that the ruling made by
the court during final
submissions not be altered.  The submission with regard
to paragraph 21 of the requisitions of 18 December1997 is not admissible.
<P>

208   	But were that ruling incorrect or otherwise, I am
satisfied that paragraph 21 of the requisition of 18 December1997 provides
no
grounds for the Plaintiff to launch a successful argument.  The requisition was
answered correctly by the Defendant.  Paragraph
21 reads (in part):
<P>

(b)	Are there any party walls?
<P>

(c) 	If the answer to (b) is "Yes" specify what rights are held in respect of
each party wall. [PX5 46]
<P>

209   	The answer provided by the Defendant was:
<P>

"(b)	Yes.  See easement for support J198678." [PX5 48]
<P>

210   	The Defendant does not represent that the easement
J198678 ran the entire length of the party wall. Even if admissible, then,
the
Plaintiffs' submission based on paragraph 21 of the requisitions of 18
December1997 fails.
<P>

211   	The answer provided for paragraph 21 was sufficient to
discharge any obligation on the vendor with regard to that requisition.
<P>

212   	The requisitions of 18 December1997 were, therefore,
properly answered.  They form no basis for disqualifying the Defendant
from
being able to issue a Notice to Complete on 27 February 1998.
<P>

<b>The Further Requisitions</b>
<P>

213   	The Plaintiff maintains that further requisitions were
sent in February of 1998.  The Plaintiff's solicitors, in a fax dated
25
February 1998 made known to the Defendants their position; being that the
property was subject to certain defects.  That fax read
(in part):
<P>

"We acknowledge your client's refusal to consider our request for an extension
of time to complete and in this regard are instructed
to request that your
client re-consider its position.
<P>

In this regard as advised by telephone our client has a reliable arrangement to
fund this purchase which is dependent on the approval
by Council of another
property due to be given by Council on the 3 March 1998.  Our client's request
in the spirit of commercial
reality is based on our client <b>accepting your
client's property with some significant defects</b>:-
<P>

<b>Firstly in relation to the condition the property has been left by the
departing tenants; and</b>
<P>

<b>Secondly in relation to the several matters of non-compliance disclosed in
the recent survey report obtained by our client</b>"
<P>

214   	The Plaintiff asserts that the letter of 25 February 1998
constituted a requisition and that the Defendant had an obligation
to answer or
comply with it accordingly.  No answer was ever issued by the Defendant.
<P>

215   	The Defendant contends that the letter placed no
obligation upon it to reply or to carry out any remedial action.  The letter
is
said not to fall within the definition of a requisition for the purpose of the
contract of sale and in any case that it is out
of time. 
<P>

216   	<b><i>Nature of requisitions</i></b>
<P>

217   	The first matter to deal with then, is whether the
correspondence of 25 February constituted a requisition.
<P>

218   	The Plaintiffs say that the letter of 25 February 1998
was a formal requisition according to the terms of clause 6 of the
<i>Conveyancing Regulations</i>.  The Defendant contends that the letter of 25
February 1998 was not a proper requisition and that it was under no obligation
to
respond to it.
<P>

219   	While Clause 5 of the contract provides for certain time
limits to be applied to different types of requisitions, it does
not otherwise
confine the right of the purchaser to make requisitions.  I will, then, look to
the general law of requisitions.  Clause
6 of the <i>Conveyancing (Sale of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation</i> 1995</a> requires the following term to be implied into
contracts for the sale of land:
<P>

"Objections and requisitions
<P>

Nothing in this contract or any other agreement prevents the purchaser,
expressly or by implication, from making any objection requisition
or claim
that the purchaser would otherwise be entitled to make in respect of:
<P>

(a)	<b>any encroachment onto any adjoining land by any building or structure on
the land</b>, other than a dividing fence as defined in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dfa1991137/" class="autolink_findacts">Dividing Fences
Act </i>1991</a>; or
<P>

(b)	<b>any encroachment onto the land by any building or structure on any
adjoining land</b>, other than a dividing fence as defined in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dfa1991137/" class="autolink_findacts">Dividing
Fences Act</i> 1991</a>; or
<P>

(c)	any <b>non-compliance with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act 1993</a>, or any regulation
under that Act</b>, in respect of any building or structure on the land,
<P>

unless the encroachment or non-compliance is disclosed and clearly described in
this contract and the contract contains an express
term precluding the
purchaser from making such an objection, requisition or claim.": Schedule 2,
<i>Conveyancing (Sale of Land) Regulations</i> 1995 (NSW) [my emphasis] 
<P>

220   	A definition of "requisition" is provided in the contract
of sale at clause 1 as:
<P>

"an objection, question or requisition (but the term does not include a
claim)"
<P>

221   	The contractual definition means that the term
"requisition" should be understood to be wide in scope, encompassing pure
`requisitions' as well as "objections" and "questions".  Helpfully, a claim is
excluded from the definition.  The broad contractual
definition reflects
standard conveyancing practice:
<P>

"The expression "requisitions on title" is often used rather loosely in
conveyancing practice and, frequently, is intended to cover
not only
requisitions on title, strictly so called, but also matters of objection to
title or conveyance and inquiries for information
in relation to the property
of the vendor":  Stonham, "The Law of Vendor and Purchaser" para 1005.
<P>

222   	A requisition on title is helpfully defined by Stonham
as:
<P>

"... a demand by the purchaser, on the vendor, for something to be done in
respect of some matter shown on the abstract of title,
and arising out of some
defect appearing therefrom or from the evidence of title shown in the
abstract.": Stonham "The Law of Vendor
and Purchaser" para 1006 p.505 
<P>

223   	An objection on title is defined as:
<P>

"an objection to the title, as shown on the abstract or particulars of title,
as compared with the title promised by the contract,
as being defective in some
particular; and objection to title ought to be accompanied by a demand, or
requisition, for the remedying
of the effect where it is remediable, or may
point out what is required to complete the abstract or perfect the title.":
Stonham
"The Law of Vendor and Purchaser" para 1007 p.505-6
<P>

224   	The contractual definition of "requisition" encompasses
both a "requisition" on title and an "objection" to title.
<P>

225   	As already mentioned above (see paragraph 180),
requisitions, properly called, can cover a wide range of subjects.  Further
requirements of a valid requisition are as follows (see Stonham para
1014ff):
<P>

226   	Requisitions firstly should be specific:  A requisition
should not constitute a general interrogatory or "catch-all":  <i>Re Ford and
Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%2010%20Ch%20D%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 10 Ch D 365</a> per James LJ at 369 and see Butt, "The Standard
Contract for Sale of Land in New South Wales" para 5.15 at 266.
<P>

227   	Requisitions secondly should not insinuate a failure on
the part of the vendor to include a matter in the particulars of
title which
the vendor knows to be material to the title: <i>Re Ford and Hill</i>.  While
this requirement might, for example, go against a `requisition' alleging an
omission or misdescription capable of fulfilling
the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s183.html" class="autolink_findacts">s183</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a> (NSW), it does not prevent a purchaser from
inquiring as to matters that do not appear in the particulars of title or from
asserting
that the title as particularised is deficient nor does it prevent
requisitions concerning matters affecting the title discovered
outside the
particulars provided by the vendor with the contract of sale: Butt (supra) para
5.15 at 266
<P>

228   	Requisitions thirdly should be clearly framed.  A
requisition ought to be framed so as to explain its materiality if otherwise
the materiality of the requisition is not obvious.
<P>

229   	Finally, requisitions must be made in time.  Subject to
the terms of the particular contract for sale of land, requisitions
may be made
at any reasonable time up until the time for completion.  In the present case,
the contract nominates the point from
which time is to run as the execution of
the contract for sale.
<P>

230   	Requisitions (which are included in the salient
definition of "requisition": see clause 1 of the contract) are of four broad
types, as identified by Barwick CJ in <i>Godfrey Constructions Pty Limited v
Kanagra Park Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1972/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%20128%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 128 CLR 529</a> at 536 (omitting footnotes):
<P>

"... it is possible to maintain the distinction between an objection to title
and an objection to conveyancing in respect of land
held under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a></i>.  An objection to title involves and assertion that there is a
defect in the vendor's title to the estate in the land which he has
sold.  An
objection or requisition as to conveyance is an objection or requirement as to
the form of the memorandum of transfer as,
for example, the absence of or the
need for parties to join in the transfer.  But solicitors are accustomed, it
seems to me, to make
both demands and inquiries which cannot be fitted into
either of these categories.  Some of these requisitions may relate to
structures
on the land or to physical features connected with it which may not
accord with the contractual terms as, for example, the connexion
of water or
sewerage services through common facilities.  These are, in my opinion, truly
requisitions demanding something of or
some action on the part of the vendor.
Other "requisitions" are merely inquiries for information.  Some of this
information the purchaser
might have been able to ascertain by his own
endeavours:  perhaps he really seeks the vendor's admission of the facts.
Then, it seems
to me, that there are other so-called "requisitions" which are
not more than reminders to the vendor of his obligations under the
contract.
Paragraphs 2 and 33 of the appellant's requisition in this case, in my opinion,
form a good example of this class of so-called
"requisitions".  The are not
objections to title nor demands as to the form of conveyance, nor do they
related to the physical condition
of the land or the structure thereon. They do
no more than remind the vendor of what is expected of him according to the
terms of
the contract as a performance of his obligations.  The respondent's
answers to requisitions so treated them."
<P>

231   	The distinction between different types of requisition
becomes material when determining whether the requisitions or objection
has
been made in time according to the contract.  I deal with that aspect below.
<P>

232   	The requisition in dispute can be restated in the
following terms:
<P>

The property has "some significant defects":
<P>

1.	"the condition the property has been left by the departing tenants"; and
<P>

2.	"several matters of non-compliance disclosed in the recent survey report
obtained by our client"
<P>

233   	The requisition was contained in a letter of 25 February
1998.  The overall effect of that letter was in terms of a compromise.
 The
Plaintiff purchaser was offering to take the property with the alleged defects
if the Defendant vendor would extend the time
for completion of the
contract.
<P>

234   	I will deal with each point of the requisition
separately.  The question to be asked in each case is whether the purported
requisition is such as to create in the vendor an obligation to answer the
requisition or rectify the problem therein objected to.
<P>

235   	The "objection" as to the state of the property cannot be
said to be an objection going to title nor an objection going to
conveyance.
If it is truly a requisition, it is one in the nature of a reminder to the
vendor of the vendor's obligations under the
contract.  It certainly does not
ask for an answer  --  save as to the compromise sought.
<P>

236   	But in any event, there is evidence to show that the
state of the property was generally agreed as between the parties in
the sense
they were aware of a vacating tenant (see paras 14 and 16 above).  
<P>

237   	Furthermore, Clause 10.1 of the contract reads:
<P>

10	Restrictions on the rights of purchaser
<P>

10.1	The purchase cannot make a claim or requisition ... in respect of --
<P>

10.1.4	any change in the property due to fair wear and tear before
completion;
<P>

238   	Furthermore, Special Condition 30 reads:
<P>

<b>30	Purchaser's Acknowledgments</b>
<P>

The purchaser agrees that:
<P>

30.4	it is purchasing the property in its present state of repair and condition
and must not make any objection, requisition or
claim for compensation
concerning the state of repair or condition of or any latent or patent defect
in quality in the property.
<P>

239   	These contractual provisions point to consequential
agreement that the Plaintiff purchaser would take the property in the
state in
which it was left by the departing tenants of whose existence they were well
aware from the outset.  That allows the conclusion
to be drawn that the first
objection made is more in the nature of a reminder of what is <i>claimed</i> to
be the vendor's obligations under the contract than a valid requisition.  But
the vendor either had no obligation in this respect
or had sufficiently
discharged that obligation.
<P>

240   	The first objection cannot be said to fall within the
class of requisitions that can be said to be general inquiries.  The
objection
seeks to oblige the vendor to improve the quality of the property where there
was no such obligation arising otherwise
under the contract or in the general
law (for example, the vendor was not required to clean the property in order to
allow for the
transfer of the title described in the contract for sale).
<P>

241   	The first objection, therefore, is not a valid
requisition when regard is had to the terms of the contract.  The Defendant
was
not under any obligation to reply or to engage in any positive action in
respect of the first objection.
<P>

242   	As to the second objection, there a reference is made to
the accompanying survey report.  That survey report, dated 16 February
1998
contained what purport to be two significant points relied upon by the
Plaintiff as evidencing "non-compliance".  I assume here
that the
`non-compliance' referred to is in reference to some non-compliance with the
contract.  The Plaintiff maintains that the
survey report discloses three
otherwise undisclosed encroachments.  The Plaintiff further contends that the
undisclosed encroachments
constituted defects in title that required to be
corrected before the Defendant could issue a notice to complete.  I will deal
with
each of the `encroachments' in turn.
<P>

243   	First, there is the matter of the party wall.  Paragraph
3  survey report read:
<P>

3.	Part of the eastern boundary of the land passes through a 355mm wide brick
party wall and a 240 mm wide brick party wall.  This
party wall is common with
the adjacent shop, No. 154 Parramatta Road, is also shown on Lot 1 of Deposited
Plan 538241.
<P>

244   	Part of the eastern wall, being a part approximately 12.3
metres in length was subject to an easement for support created
by Transfer No.
J198678 [Souter, affidavit 16 September 1999 para 3.1].  The remainder of the
wall of approximately 18.3 metres in
length was between 240mm wide and 355mm
wide and stood over the eastern boundary of the land [Souter affidavit 6
September 1999 para
3.2].
<P>

245   	The Defendant argues that a proper reading of paragraph 3
reveals no encroachment and, therefore, no non-compliance with
the contract is
identified.
<P>

246   	The first point is that the encroachment of the party
wall was subject to an easement for a portion of its length.  It was
only the
original wall, making up some 60% of the length of the party wall that
encroached upon the property in question.  That does
not negate the validity of
any requisition relating thereto.
<P>

247   	The second matter relates to the way in which the
boundary and the alleged encroachment are measured.  The party wall in
question
was constructed some time before September 1898.  The surveyor gave evidence to
the following effect:
<P>

Q.	Indeed, can I suggest to you that it is a notorious fact that party walls
constructed in the last century are invariably not
precisely on the boundary
line?
<P>

A	Quite often the boundary passes through the centre of the party walls.  The
walls are - actually become the monument.  We have
in surveying - it is the
monument over the measurement because measurements have got more accurate in
recent times. It  does not
make any difference if it is twenty feet between two
party walls or ten feet, the party walls are still the boundary as shown on
the
original plan. [T, 130:50]
<P>

248   	Later, however, Mr Souter said the following:
<P>

Q.	Is the upshot of this, Mr Souter, is that part of the wall which is not the
subject of the easement had been constructed not
precisely along the boundary,
that is, the eastern boundary?
<P>

A.	It was not constructed along it, no.
<P>

Q.	Again, I suggest that it was quite common for party walls constructed in the
1800's not to have been constructed precisely along
the boundary, in your
experience?
<P>

A.	I don't know if it is that common.  Quite often the system of land title
back then was old system and when a primary building
was done the land was
brought under Torrens title.  The boundaries were moved to be along the centre
of the walls with easements
for support on either side.
<P>

Q.	In your own experience, it is not uncommon for party walls constructed in
the 1800's not to have been done so precisely along
the subject boundary?
<P>

A.	Yes, that did happen, yeah.[T, 131.45]
<P>

249   	While this evidence does suggest that it may have been in
the knowledge of the Plaintiff before the signing of the contract
that the
party wall was an encroachment , it does not suggest that the contract
disclosed the encroachment or that it was the subject
of an agreement between
the parties.
<P>

250   	Thirdly, the Defendant maintains that there is nothing in
the survey that identifies an encroachment of any kind by the party
wall.  The
survey report, including the attached sketch, the Defendant contends, merely
identifies the characteristics of the party
wall and does not expressly mention
encroachment.  It says, therefore, that the survey does not indicate any defect
in the title
of the property in relation to the party wall.
<P>

251   	The survey report refers to the party wall in paragraphs
two and three of that report:
<P>

"2.	Part of the eastern wall of the building stands over the eastern boundary
of the land by up to 205mm.  An Easement for Support
for this part of the wall
has been created by Transfer No. J198678 and as shown on DP217155.
<P>

3.	Part of the eastern boundary of the land passes though a 355 mm wide brick
party wall and a 240mm wide brick party wall.  The
party wall is common with
the adjacent shop, No. 154 Parramatta Road, is also shown on Lot 1 of Deposited
Plan 538241.
<P>

...
<P>

Apart from fencing irregularities or as stated or shown on the sketch overleaf,
there are no other visible encroachments by or upon
the said land". [PX5 52]
<P>

252   	The question is, then, whether the `requisition' was
clear enough in its terms so as to be valid.  
<P>

253   	The report was accompanied by a survey sketch.  The
survey sketch had marked upon it "party wall" and "easement" for the
appropriate parts of the property.   The survey sketch does not have marked
upon the word "encroachment" to indicate the defect complained
of.  On its own,
the survey sketch cannot be said to reveal the alleged encroachment.  
<P>

254   	An important matter going to this question is that the
requisition is in the form of a demand (as opposed to a requisition
at common
law or a general inquiry).  It is not that the Plaintiff purchaser is asking
the Defendant vendor to disclose information,
such as the existence of
encroachments by the party wall or otherwise.  Rather, the Plaintiff seeks to
have the survey and report
construed as a demand on title.  The demand must be
clear enough to have enabled the Defendant vendor to identify the matter
complained
of to an extent that the vendor could take steps to rectify the
contended defect.
<P>

255   	The survey report does not indicate the extent of the
alleged encroachment and, as stated above, the survey sketch was not
sufficient
to disclose the extent or nature of the encroachment.  The encroachment is not
sufficiently disclosed by the letter of
25 February, the survey report or the
accompanying survey sketch to amount to a valid demand on title.  
<P>

256   	I conclude there is no valid requisition with respect to
the party wall.
<P>

257   	The survey report then referred to the awning and the
air-conditioning unit.
<P>

258   	The awnings were referred to in the surveyors report of
16 February 1998 at point 4 in the following terms:
<P>

"4.	A street awning overhangs Parramatta Road and Mallett Street.  This awning
is behind the 3.66 metre kerb line of both streets."
<P>

259   	The Defendant claims never to have had a requisition in
relation to awnings on the building.  In the alternative the Defendant
contends
that approval was given by the Council in respect of the building, including
the awnings on 4 May 1998 and that, in any
case, at any time before the notice
to complete, the awnings did not constitute a defect in title.  
<P>

260   	The questions before me, then, are firstly whether, in
its terms, the letter and survey report amounted to a requisition
with respect
to the awning and secondly whether the encroachment, in the case of the awning,
amounted to a defect in title to which
the Defendant vendor could attend.
<P>

261   	Dealing with the first question, the words of the survey
report are clear enough to amount to a demand on title in respect
of the
awning.  The awning was not "disclosed and clearly described" in the contract
nor did the contract contain "an express term
precluding the purchaser from
making" the objection: <i>Conveyancing (Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation</i> 1995</a>,
Schedule 2 (see cl. 6).  
<P>

262   	As to the second question, a Building Certificate was
issued by the Council pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</i> 1993</a> dated 4
May 1998.  Relevantly, the certificate reads:
<P>

<b>The Council certifies that</b> in relation to the building or part
identified below the Council:-
<P>

a)	by virtue of anything existing or occurring before the date of issue in this
certificate; or
<P>

...
<P>

<b>must not -</b>
<P>

...
<P>

d)	take proceedings for an order or injunction requiring the demolition,
alteration, addition or rebuilding of or to the building
or part; or
<P>

e)	take proceedings in relation to any encroachment by the building or part
onto land vested in or under the control of the Council.
<P>

263   	The Plaintiff's response is that the relevant date is not
4 May 1998 but 27 February 1998.  The survey prepared on behalf
of the
Plaintiff and served upon the Defendant's solicitors before 27 February 1998
clearly showed the encroachments the subject
of the requisition.
<P>

264   	It is evident that many, if not, the majority of
properties along Parramatta Road in the vicinity of the property in question
have awnings of the type present on the building.  It would be highly unlikely,
therefore, that Council approval would not have been
either in de facto
existence at the time of settlement or that the Council would not have approved
the awning upon application being
made for it so to do.  The Defendants rely on
evidence of Garry Raymond Williams, an employee of South Sydney City Council to
assert
that the awning was, even before 4 May 1998, in compliance with the
general policy of the Council and that it would not need to be
altered or
removed to comply with the Council regulations (see Williams affidavit 22
September 1999 paras 4-7).
<P>

265   	While, as discussed above (see paragraph 196), the awning
did not constitute a matter detrimental to the value of the property,
it cannot
be similarly said that the awning did not constitute an encroachment not
disclosed in the contract.  As an encroachment
not disclosed in the contract,
the awning amounted to a defect in title and could be the subject of a valid
demand on title.  In
<i>Svanosio v McNamara</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2096%20CLR%20186" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 96 CLR 186</a>, the High
Court stated that:
<P>

"If the contract states that certain premises are erected on the land sold,
that is a representation that the vendor will make title
to land on which those
premises are erected... If the premises are not erected wholly on the land sold
the vendor will fail to fulfil
the promise or in other words will fail to make
a good title to the whole of the land described in the contract. ... When the
purchaser
discovers that part of the building is not on the land he should
object to the title.  Such a misdescription is an objection to the
title": at
205 per McTiernan, Williams &amp; Webb JJ.   
<P>

266   	This proposition is supported by Hamilton J in
<i>Suburban Constructions Pty Limited v Mancan Pty Limited</i> (1997) 8 BPR
15,529 (NSWSC, 18 April 1997).  In that case he found that if the description
of the property in the contract extends
to a building on the premises, then it
should be taken to be intended that the purchaser should get the whole of the
building.  The
principle emerging from that case is that if what is described
in the contract for the sale of the property encroaches onto adjoining
lands
then there is a defect in title.  In the present case the contract discloses
the improvements to the property as "Commercial
premises".  Applying the
principle, then, if any part of the Commercial premises, including, for present
purposes, the awning, encroaches
on neighbouring lands, there is a defect in
title.
<P>

267   	With respect to the air-conditioning unit, the
air-conditioning unit is disclosed in the contract as an inclusion [PX5 2].
The evidence also suggests that there was an agreement to leave the
air-conditioning unit in place.  Since the survey report and
letter is not in
the nature of a request and no demand can validly be made to `rectify'
something that has already been disclosed
in the contract and does not
otherwise constitute a defect in title, the `requisition' with regard to the
air-conditioning unit is
not a valid one.
<P>

268   	The "requisitions" of 25 February 1998 are, save as with
respect to the awning, not proper requisitions and have no bearing
on the
Defendant's ability to issue a notice to complete.  With regard to the awning,
it is necessary to determine whether the requisitions
were made in time
according to the contract.  Made outside the time limits prescribed by the
contract, a requisition cannot have
any effect.
<P>

<b><i>Time of requisition</i></b>
<P>

269   	Clause 5 of the contract states:
<P>

<b>5	Requisitions</b>
<P>

If the purchaser is or become entitled to make a requisition, the purchaser can
make it only by serving it -
<P>

5.1	if it arises out of this contract (apart from clause 13) or it is a general
question about the property or the title - within
21 days after the date of
this contract;
<P>

5.2	if it arises out of anything served by the vendor - within 21 days after
the later of the date of this contract and that service
; and
<P>

5.3	in any other case - within a reasonable time [PX5 5]
<P>

270   	The first matter, then, is to determine the nature of
valid requisitions.  The requisition, being a demand that the Defendant
rectify
the unauthorised encroachment amounted to by the awning, is a demand on title
(see paragraph 263).  The requisition then
arises out of the contract and is in
relation to title.  The relevant time limit to apply is the limit in clause 5.1
of 21 days.
<P>

271   	The 21 day time limit expired on 25 December1997.  This
was raised by the Defendant's solicitors in a letter to the Plaintiff's
solicitors of 17 March 1998, which contained the following:
<P>

1.	<b>Survey matters</b> - The time for raising requisitions has long since
expired.  In any event, enquires with South Sydney City Council will reveal
that
consent to the awning over the footpath has been granted and that as late
as 1995 the Council's consent to signage on the awning
was also granted.  Any
encroachment by the air conditioning unit is not a matter which would entitle
your client to withhold completion.
 The air conditioner is in any event
removable without affecting its operability or otherwise.
<P>

272   	The rules governing the time for making of requisitions,
including clause 5 of the Standard Contract for Sale of Land (the
terms of
which are employed in this case), are subject to a judicial "gloss": see Butt,
The Standard Contract for Sale of Land para
5.2 at 257.  Where the gloss
applies, the purchase may raise objections or requisitions at any time up until
completion.  Butt identifies
four types of objections or requisitions to which
the gloss may be applied (see Butt, "The Standard Contract for the Sale of Land
in New South Wales" at para 5.26 at 272):
<P>

(1)	objections or requisitions as to conveyance;
<P>

(2)	reminders to the vendor of the vendor's obligations under the contract;
<P>

(3)	objections going to the root of the title; and
<P>

(4)	objections or requisitions arising "aliunde" (from elsewhere).
<P>

273   	The requisition here does not fall within the first three
categories.  With respect to the fourth, that is, objections or
requisitions
arising <i>aliunde</i>, it is unlikely that the Defendant can enjoy the benefit
of the gloss.
<P>

274   	It is settled law that, in the case of an assignment of
Old System title, requisitions or objections arising out of matters
<i>aliunde</i>, that is matters arising from inquiries elsewhere and not shown
on the abstract of title, are not subject to contractual time limits
of the
type in clause 5.1 and 5.2:  see Stonham, "The Law of Vendor and Purchaser"
para 1025 at 515;  Butt, "The Standard Contract
for the Sale of Land in New
South Wales" para 5.36 at 280-1.  With regard to Old System title then:
<P>

"... notwithstanding the expiration of the time fixed by such a clause (such as
the common clause) for making requisitions, it is
still open to the purchaser
to show, if he can, from searches or inquiries or by obtaining information from
any other quarters, that
there are defects in the title, not disclosed in the
abstract or particulars of title, whether arising before, during or subsequent
to the period in which the vendor is bound to prove his title; and a defect so
discovered, at any time before completion, may be
relied on: see Re Lemon &amp;
Davies Contract <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1919/68.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1919] VicLawRp 68</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281919%29%20VLR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1919) VLR 481":</a>  Stonham, para 1025 at 515
<P>

275   	The position with respect to Torrens title, as is
relevant in the present case, is different.  There is no settled position
in
Australian law with respect to the gloss in these circumstances: Butt (supra).
I do not, however, need to decide the issue here.
<P>

276   	Where the gloss applies, the rule is that the requisition
or demand must be made within a reasonable time of the purchaser
becoming aware
of the alleged defect.  
<P>

277   	The reasonableness of the time for requisition depends,
in part, upon the conclusion reached as to the agreed completion
date.  It
seems unavoidable that if one concludes that the completion date was agreed as
27 February 1998 then the issuing of a requisition
some two days prior to that
date could not be said to have occurred within a `reasonable time' from the
exchange of contracts.
<P>

278   	As I have decided above, the completion date of the
contract was 27 February 1998.  The demand in respect of the awning was
not,
therefore served within a reasonable time of the exchange of contracts.
<P>

279   	If I am incorrect in saying that the requisition can only
fall within the terms of clause 5.1, then the only other appropriate
time limit
is that provided for in clause 5.3.  Since I have concluded that the
requisition would not have been made within a reasonable
time if the Plaintiff
had been relying on the <i>aliunde</i> rule, I must also conclude that the
requisition was not made within a reasonable time according to clause 5.3.
<P>

280   	The terms of Schedule 2 of the <i>Conveyancing (Sale of
Land) Regulations</i> 1995 has no effect on the time in which requisitions can
be made.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

281   	There are no validly issued requisitions that have not
been sufficiently and properly answered by the Defendant vendor. 
The Defendant
is not in default of the contract and is not, on that basis, disqualified from
issuing a notice to complete.
<P>

<b>That the defendant vendor was not able, ready and willing to proceed to
completion:  defects in title</b>
<P>

282   	While there were no valid requisitions issued that
remained unanswered by the Defendant, that is not to say that there were
no
defects in title at the time the notice to complete was issued.  For example,
the awning, which as I have already concluded, amounted
to a defect in title
and remained so as at 27 February 1998.  Similarly, although it cannot be said
that a valid requisition was
issued with respect to the encroaching party wall,
that encroachment did still amount to a defect in title (although an extremely
minor one).  The air-conditioning unit, on the other hand, could not be said to
amount to a defect in title (see above).
<P>

283   	The argument is put by the Plaintiff that the
non-disclosed encroachments constitute defects in title and that the defects
in
title constitute breaches of the contract for the sale of the subject property.
The Plaintiff claims that the vendor was not "willing
and ready to complete the
contract" [PX5 56] for sale as the Defendant so claimed in the notice to
complete dated 27 February 1998.
 It is well established that a notice to
complete can only be valid if the party issuing the notice is ready, willing
and able to
proceed to completion at the time he give notice to the other party
to complete: <i>Abraham v Mallon </i>(1975) 1 BPR 9157 at 9160 per Holland J;
see <i>Re Barr's Contract</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20Ch%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] Ch 551</a> at 556.
<P>

284   	In the English case of <i>Johns v Deacan</i> (English CA,
, 23 January 1985, unreported) discussed in <i>Clowes Developments (UK) Limited
v Mulchinock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20WLR%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 WLR 42</a> at 49-50), the vendor had issued a notice to
complete in circumstances where there was a misdescription contained in the
contract
for sale.  The particulars included reference to a stable block.
After exchange of contracts the parties discovered that the stable
block had
been removed and could not be replaced.  The contract for sale contained a
clause similar in terms to clause 6 of the present
contract that a
misdescription should not annul the sale but should entitle the purchaser to
compensation.  Browne-Wilkinson LJ said
in that case:
<P>

"A valid notice to complete could not be served... since the vendor at that
stage was not able and willing to complete. He could
not complete on the terms
that he was to receive the full &#163;100,000, because, by reason of the
misdescription provisions, that
no longer was the full purchase price payable.
The purchase price payable was &#163;100,000 less the compensation.  Unless and
until
that reduction in the purchase price had been agreed, he could neither
make title to the whole of the property contract to be sold
not make title to
the lesser amount, being the property less the stable block.  Accordingly, he
was in no position to say at that
stage that he was able and willing to
complete ... the contract": cited in <i>Clowes Development Limited v
Mulchinock</i> at 50
<P>

285   	The decision of Browne-Wilkinson LJ was interpreted by
Carnwath J as follows:
<P>

"The language of that judgment could perhaps be taken as implying that,
whenever there is a potential compensation claim, there
cannot be a valid
notice to complete until that compensation has been settled.  I doubt, however,
if it was intended to express the
matter so widely.  On the facts of that case,
it was not simply a matter of misdescription of the subject matter of the sale.
The
vendor was unable to convey that which he had contracted to sell, which
included the stable block.  Thus, if one asks the question...
"Could the
vendors carry out their contract?"  the answer was "No, they could not.":
<i>Clowes Development Limited v Mulchinock</i> at 50
<P>

286   	The Australian authorities point out that for the
principles in the paragraphs quoted to apply, the claim for compensation
must
have been made before the notice to complete was issued.  In <i>Abraham v
Mallon</i> (1975) 1 BPR 9157 the purchasers claimed that the vendors were not
entitled to issue a notice to complete since, inter alia, at the
time of the
notice, the vendors were not "able" to complete in that they did not have title
to all subject matter of the sale as
two outbuildings described in the contract
did not stand wholly upon the land to which the vendors did have title.  The
minor encroachments
were identified by a survey report made through the
purchaser's efforts.  In circumstances similar, though not identical, to the
present case, Holland J applied the principles summarised in the judgment of
Menzies J in <i>Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd v Vlattas</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 1</a> at
27-28:
<P>

"At common law, any difference, however trivial, between the land described in
the contract and the land produced constituted a
defect which entitled the
purchaser to rescind.
<P>

"Where there was only a slight difference, the Courts of Equity began to
interfere and introduced the principle of compensation
for deficiency: see
Erskin L.C. in <i>Halsey v Grant</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1806/290.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1806] EngR 290</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281806%29%2013%20Ves%20Jr%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1806) 13 Ves. Jun. 73</a> at pp. 76-79.
Unless the [28] deficiency was so substantial as to give the purchaser
something entirely different from what he had
contracted, equity would order
specific performance on giving compensation for the deficiency.
<P>

"Also to avoid the harsh effect of the common law, it became the practice to
insert in contracts a clause stating that a difference
from the description of
the subject matter would not annul the sale.  These clauses were of two types:
those which allowed compensation
to the purchaser for a deficiency, and those
which did not.  The right to compensation under a clause in the contract was
independent
of the right to compensation in a claim for specific
performance.
<P>

"However, where there was a clause in the contract preventing the sale from
being annulled even if the purchaser had the right to
compensation for a
misdescription, equity would still permit the purchaser to rescind if the
misdescription was a substantial one:
see <i>Flight v Booth</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1834/1087.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1834] EngR 1087</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281834%29%201%20Bing%20NC%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1834) 1 Bing

<P>

287   	In <i>Abraham v Mallon</i>, Holland J concluded that so
long as the purchaser had not made a claim for compensation, the vendor was
entitled to give a notice
to complete.  This conclusion was reached by first
reasoning that, on the basis of the equitable rule, the vendor would have been
entitled to compel completion if he offered compensation for the insubstantial
defect in title.  Secondly, a clause in the following
terms (similar to the
terms of clause 6 in the present contract) was included in the contract:
<P>

"No error or misdescription of the property shall annul the sale but
compensation if demanded in writing before completion but not
otherwise shall
be made or given as the case may require,..."
<P>

288   	The operation of this clause allowed the notice to
complete to be issued without offering compensation where such compensation
had
not already been claimed.  Holland J wrote at 9167:
<P>

"In my opinion, the vendors are entitled to rely upon the fact that cl 5 says
that the error or misdescription is not to annul the
sale and upon the words"
but compensation if demanded in writing before completion but not otherwise
shall be made or given", to
say that until compensation is demanded by the
purchasers, the purchasers remain bound to complete without it and to accept on
completion
a conveyance of such title as the vendor has.  Full force, must, I
think, be given to the words which I have just quoted.  And this
is given by
saying that the purchasers remain bound to complete notwithstanding an error or
misdescription for which compensation
is payable under cl 5 without such
compensation so long as they fail to demand it.  If this were not the case, a
vendor in a case
to which cl 5 applied would be blocked from requiring
completion in accordance with the terms of the contract as long as a purchaser,
aware of a defect for which compensation could be demanded, chose to remain
silent.  In my opinion, as the purchasers remained silent
throughout the
relevant period in the present case, the vendors were entitled at the time of
giving their notice to complete and
up to the date of rescission to require the
purchasers to complete the contract by accepting a conveyance of the title
which the
vendors had and paying for it the full amount of the purchase money
without deduction by way of compensation because to do so was
fully in
accordance with the requirements of the contract and, accordingly, it could not
validly be said that because at the relevant
times they were not able to
complete in accordance with those requirements the vendors were disabled from
giving a notice to complete
and rescinding for non-compliance with it."
<P>

289   	Similarly, I find in the present case, that the
encroachments amounted to by the party wall and the awning were not substantial
defects.  They were only those insubstantial defects of the type where the
equitable rule would still allow specific performance
upon the proffering of
compensation. 
<P>

290   	As to the party wall, a document that does identify an
encroachment is DP 1001633 [PX7 last page].  DP 1001633 shows that
the relevant
portion of the wall is 18.3 meters in length.  (The balance of the wall is
subject to cross-easements for support as
discussed above).  Of the 18.3m, a
length of 6.13 m has a width of 240mm.  Of the 240mm, 130mm is located on the
subject property
and 110mm is located on the adjoining property.  This amounts
to an encroachment by this part of the wall on the subject property
of 10mm.
<P>

291   	DP 1001633 discloses that the remaining 12.17m of the
party wall is 355mm in width.  According to the plan, 135mm is located
on the
subject property and 220mm is located on the adjoining property.  Consequently,
this equates to an encroachment on the adjoining
property of 43mm.  The
encroachment of the party wall is, then, on any view an insubstantial defect in
title.  This is supported
by the fact that the creation of cross-easements for
the wall could be achieved at very little cost in relation to the value of the
property (see <i>Abraham v Mallon</i> at 9163).
<P>

292   	With regards to the awning, the encroachment is an
insubstantial defect in title.  The size of the awning here is not conclusive.
The prevalence of such awnings on buildings in the vicinity of the subject
property, the evidence of Mr Williams and the subsequent
s.174 certificate
obtained by the Defendant vendor indicate  that the defect constituted by the
awning was insubstantial.
<P>

293   	In the words of Kearney J in <i>Mayer v Vitale</i> (1981)
2 BPR 9162 at 9168 it "could not be said that the Plaintiffs are not getting
substantially what they bargained for and it
could not be said that the
property with this minor encroachment [by] it is different from the property
the subject of the contract
so as to justify rescission of the contract on the
basis of a substantial defect in title".  There is no substantial defect in
title
arising from or constituting an error or misdescription or otherwise that
would invalidate the notice to complete.
<P>

294   	By adopting reasoning similar to that of Holland J, I
also find that the terms of the contract made the proffering of compensation
by
the vendor without demand so to do unnecessary.  Clause 6 in the present
contract for sale is in the following terms:
<P>

<b>"6	Error or misdescription</b>
<P>

The purchaser can (but only before completion) claim compensation for an error
or misdescription in this contract (as to the property,
the title or anything
else and whether substantial or not".
<P>

295   	Since there was no demand for compensation by the
Plaintiff purchasers during the time of the notice to complete or before
that
time and as it cannot be said that the demands on title purported to be made by
the letter of 25 February 1998 constituted demands
for compensation for the
encroachments therein allegedly described, I find, in a way similar to Holland
J in <i>Abraham v Mallon</i> (also see <i>Mayer v Vitale</i> (1981) 2 BPR 9162
at 9169), that the vendor was ready, willing and able to complete the contract
at the time the notice to complete
was issued.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

296   	The notice to complete issued by the Defendant vendor on
27 February 1998 is, therefore, valid.
<P>

<b>Question Three:  Termination</b>
<P>

297   	Having concluded that the notice to complete was validly
issued by the Defendant, the matter remaining for resolution is
whether the
contract was validly terminated by the Defendant vendor.  
<P>

298   	The notice to complete issued by the Defendant on 27
February 1998 nominated 16 March 1998 as the date for settlement.  Settlement
did not take place on that day.  On 17 March 1998, the Defendant's solicitors
sent a letter to the Plaintiff's solicitors attaching
a notice of
termination.
<P>

299   	The Plaintiff makes its argument in the following
terms:
<P>

1.	A "completion date is not the date that a contract must be concluded by,
unless time is an essential term of the contract" [Plaintiff's
written
submissions in reply para 11.1.2 at 9]
<P>

2.	Time was not an essential term of the contract since Clause 35 of the
contract allowed for interest to accrue on the amount payable
under the
contract if settlement did not occur at 27 February 1998 [Plaintiff's written
submissions in reply para 11.1.3 at 9]
<P>

300   	In <i>Neeta (Epping) Pty Limited v Phillips</i> (supra),
the leading judges decided that:
<P>

"In cases where the contract contains a stipulation as to time but that
stipulation is not an essential term then before a notice
can be given fixing a
time of performance, not only must one party be in breach or guilty of
unreasonable delay, but also the party
giving the notice must himself be free
of default by way of breach or antecedent relevant delay.  Only then may a
notice be given
fixing a day a reasonable time ahead of performance and making
that time of the essence of the contract": at p 299 per Barwick CJ
and Jacobs
J.
<P>

301   	As discussed above, those conditions for the issuing of a
notice to complete have been met.  Paragraph 5 and 6 of the notice
to complete
issued by the Defendant read:
<P>

5.	The vendor requires the purchaser to complete the contract by Monday, 16
March 1998 and in this respect the vendor makes time
of the essence of the
contract both at law and in equity.
<P>

6.	If the purchaser does not comply strictly with this notice the vendor will
be entitled to exercise all of the vendor's rights
under the contract and the
general law in respect of a breach of an essential condition of the contract.
[PX5 56]
<P>

302   	The effect of the notice to complete is then to make the
time nominated in the notice "of the essence of the contract". 
In reply to the
Plaintiff's first submission, it is sufficient to point out that the breach of
the time stipulation in the contract,
which occurred when the contract was not
completed by 27 February 1998, does not itself need to be construed as a breach
of an essential
term of the contract.  Breach of the Completion Date as
contained in the contract will not, alone, give rise to a right in the vendor
to rescind the contract.  Breach of the time for completion in the contract is
enough, however, to enable the vendor, while the vendor
is not in default and
is ready, willing and able to proceed towards completion, to issue a notice to
complete.  Once the notice to
complete is issued, time does become an essential
aspect of the contract.  
<P>

303   	This accords with the position in equity as described by
Glass JA in <i>Ciavarella v Balmer</i> [1983] 2 NSWLR 439 at 450, in the New
South Wales Court of Appeal:
<P>

"...the promise to complete is essential and that which equity treats as not of
the essence is the failure to perform it strictly
in time.  A non-performance
before any notice is given amounts to no more than a slight breach sounding
only in damages.  Non-compliance
with a valid notice to complete, however, is a
serious breach and liable to be treated as fundamental.  I would prefer to
describe
the ground of rescission in this manner rather than as a renunciation
since the recipient who unsuccessfully disputes the reasonableness
of the time
limited by the notice will be exposed to rescission no matter how anxious he
may be to maintain the contract."
<P>

304   	Note also that pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act</i> 1919</a>, stipulations as to time which would not have been of the essence
in equity are not of the essence at common law.  At the High Court,
<i>Ciavarella v Balmer</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20153%20CLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 153 CLR 438</a>, the Court affirmed the findings
of Glass JA:
<P>

"We agree with the view expressed by Glass JA in the Court of Appeal that the
effect of a valid notice to complete, once the purchaser
fails to comply, is to
establish the existence of an essential breach, the breach which preceded the
giving of the notice being non-essential.
 The function of the notice is to fix
a reasonable time for completion so that non-compliance with its requirements
evidences a fundamental
breach or renunciation.  The effect of the notice is
not to convert a non-essential term into an essential term.  In this respect
what is important for present purposes is that the notice requires completion
of the contract, notwithstanding that the object of
the party issuing the
notice is to place himself in a  position in which he can terminate the
contract in the event of non-compliance
with the requirements of the notice,
should he choose so to do... The point is that it is the failure of the party
in breach to complete
in accordance with the innocent party's insistence on
completion as expressed in his valid notice to complete that brings into
existence
the innocent party's right to terminate the contract.": at 448
<P>

305   	Deane J in <i>Braidotti v Queensland City Properties
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172 CLR 293</a> at 307 described the default giving rise to a
right in the vendor to rescind as a failure to participate, on behalf of the
purchaser,
in the completion process:
<P>

"A general notice to complete a contract for sale of land requires the
participation of the recipient of the notice in the process
of completion to
the extent necessary on the part of the recipient to complete or execute the
contract.  In a case such as the present
where the recipient of the notice to
complete simply refuses or fails to participate in the essential steps of the
completion process,
rescission consequent upon that refusal or failure is not
based upon default in the performance of a particular term of the contract.
Its basis is that the refusal or failure of the other party to participate in
the essential steps of the completion process constitutes
a repudiation or
renunciation by that party of the contract as a whole."
<P>

306   	The time stipulation that must be complied with is that
nominated in the notice to complete.  No argument was put to this
Court that
the time stipulation in the notice to complete was unreasonable.
<P>

307   	In respect of the second point of argument raised by the
Plaintiff, Special Condition 35 of the contract states:
<P>

<b>"35 	Interest for late completion</b>
<P>

Without limiting any other right of the vendor, if completion of this contract
takes place after the Completion date it is in an
essential term of this
contract, on completion, the purchaser must pay interest to the vendor
calculated on the unpaid balance of
the price at the rate of 8% per annum on a
daily basis from but not including the Completion date and including the date
on which
this contract is completed.  The purchaser need not pay interest for
any period where the delay in completing is caused by the vendor."
[PX5 13]
<P>

308   	This paragraph is not to be construed as an agreement by
the parties not to be bound to complete on the date of settlement
nominated in
any notice to complete.  Rather, Special Condition 35 operates in any situation
where the completion occurred after
the Completion date of 27 February 1998.
The clause cannot have any effect on the vendor's competence to issue a notice
of termination
arising out of a breach of an essential term of the contract or
notices validly issued under the contract by the purchaser.  
<P>

309   	Given that the notice to complete was validly issued by
the Defendant and was operative to make time the essence of the contract,
the
validity of the termination by the Defendant for non-compliance with the notice
to complete on behalf of the Plaintiff cannot
be resisted.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

310   	The contract was validly terminated by the Defendant.
<P>

<b>Question Four:  Damages</b>
<P>

311   	As I have concluded that the contract was validly
terminated by the Defendant, it follows that the Plaintiff cannot be entitled
to any damages or compensation arising from that termination where is was not
unconscionable of the Defendant so to terminate the
contract.
<P>

<b>Question Five:  Retention of the Deposit</b>
<P>

312   	While the Plaintiff is not entitled to any damages
arising out of any act or omission of the Defendant in relation to the
termination of the contract, there remains the question of whether the
Plaintiff is entitled to the return of deposit monies paid
to the Defendant's
agent.
<P>

313   	A deposit of $134,750 was paid to the Defendant's agent
by the Plaintiff on 4 December 1997. 
<P>

314   	The Plaintiff bases its claim on sub-sections (1), (2)
and (2a) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a> (NSW). 
<P>

315   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a> reads,
relevantly:
<P>

<b>"Right of purchaser to recover deposit etc</b>
<P>

55	(1)	In every case where specific performance of a contract would not be
enforced against the purchaser by the court by reason
of a defect in the
vendor's title, but the purchaser is not entitled to rescind the contract, the
purchaser shall nevertheless be
entitled to recover his deposit and any
instalments of purchase money he has paid, and to be relieved from all
liability under the
contract whether at law or in equity, unless the contract
discloses such defect and contains a stipulation precluding the purchaser
from
objecting thereto.
<P>

(2)	If such undisclosed defect is one which is known or ought to have been
known to the vendor at the date of the contract the purchaser
shall in addition
be entitled to recover his expense of investigating the title.
<P>

(2A)	In every case where the court refuses to grant specific performance of a
contract, or in any proceeding for the return of a
deposit, the court may, if
it thinks fit, order the repayment of any deposit with or without interest
thereon.
<P>

(3)	On the application of the purchaser the court may order payment under this
section and declare and enforce a lien in respect
thereof on the property the
subject of the contract"
<P>

I will deal with each subsection in turn.  I will then deal with the effect of
clause 9 of the contract.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55(1)</a></b>
<P>

316   	The rationale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> was explained by Long Innes J in
<i>Bennett v Stuart</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1927/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1927] NSWStRp 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281927%29%2027%20SR%28NSW%29%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1927) 27 SR(NSW) 317</a> at 327:
<P>

"As I understand it, the object of the section was to enable a purchaser to
recover his deposit in a case in which, though he had
contracted to accept such
title as the vendor had, or had otherwise precluded himself from relying upon a
defect in the vendor's
title, the Court of Equity would not "by reason of a
defect in the vendor's title" have enforced specific performance of the
contract
against the purchaser.  It consequently has no application to a case
where the Court finds in fact that there is no defect in the
vendor's title;
nor, as it seems to me, to a case in which the Court of Equity would refuse to
decree specific performance because
the title was too doubtful".
<P>

317   	Thus, for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> to operate so as to require the vendor
to return the deposit paid by the purchaser, the Court must be satisfied
that:
<P>

1.	There is a defect in title; and
<P>

2.	the contract does not disclose the defect or [inclusive "or"] the contract
does not contain a stipulation precluding the purchaser
from objecting to the
defect in title; and
<P>

3.	the Court would not enforce specific performance of the contract; and
<P>

4.	the purchaser is not entitled to rescind the contract (e.g. through
fundamental breach on the part of the vendor)
<P>

318   	If the fourth condition is not met, then although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a>
has no operation, the purchaser will normally be able to recover the deposit
monies in an action against the vendor for breach of
contract.  
<P>

<b><i>Defects in Title</i></b>
<P>

319   	The Plaintiff alleges three defects in title, namely, the
air conditioning unit, the awning and the party wall as identified
in the
surveyors report of 16 February 1998.
<P>

320   	As discussed above (see paragraph 280), the awning and
the encroaching party wall did constitute defects in title.
<P>

<b><i>Disclosure of Defect</i></b>
<P>

321   	The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff purchaser was
aware of the presence of the air conditioning unit at all material
times and
that, therefore, the contract did not need to disclose its existence.  As
discussed above, the presence of the air-conditioning
unit cannot be said to
have given rise to a defect in title.
<P>

322   	With respect to the awning and the party wall, neither
encroachment (which in this case also constituted a defect in title)
was
disclosed in the contract for sale.  The inclusion of clause 10 in the contract
[PX5 6] is, then, of no relevance at this point.
<P>

<b><i>Specific Performance</i></b>
<P>

323   	Having concluded, therefore, that there were in existence
at the time of termination of the contract, defects in title that
were not
disclosed in the contract, the Plaintiff must establish that the court would
not, on the basis of those defects, have awarded
specific performance of the
contract as against the purchaser.
<P>

324   	The Defendant argues that, on the evidence, the Court
could not refuse an order that the purchaser specifically perform the
contract
if that had been prosecuted at the appropriate time.  The Defendant puts it in
their outline of submissions thus:
<P>

The matters relied upon by the Plaintiff in respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> are not defects
that would prevent an order for an order for specific performance and therefore
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> does not apply.  At most they amount to claims for compensation which
are not the subject of these proceedings.  Consequently a court
would in the
circumstances, make an order for specific performance.
<P>

325   	The encroachment of the party wall and the awning onto
adjoining lands in this case reveals a misdescription of the property
by the
contract.  These encroachments do not constitute defects in title so as to make
the title too doubtful to be the subject of
a specifically enforceable
contract.  Mere defects in title do not prohibit an order for specific
performance.  Spry writes:
<P>

"A further situation where specific performance is sometimes granted, although
the contract in question cannot be enforced at law
by the Plaintiff, arises
where there is a contract for the sale of an interest in land and there is an
error in description or a
deficiency in title.": Equitable Remedies  at 289
<P>

326   	With respect to the party wall the encroachments
identified by DP 1001633 are so small as not to form any basis upon which
a
court would refuse an order for specific performance of the contract for sale
if petitioned by the vendor.  The misdescription
with respect to the party wall
is an insubstantial one.
<P>

327   	With respect to the awning, as I have found above (see
paragraph 290), the nature and circumstances of the awning make the
misdescription insubstantial and insufficient thereby to convince the Court
that an order of specific performance could not be made.
<P>

328   	With respect to the air-conditioning unit, if in any case
the unit could be described as a defect in title, this Court would
still have
ordered specific performance of the contract notwithstanding.  It would be
unconscionable for the Plaintiff to represent
that the air-conditioning unit
should be retained (see above, paragraphs 13 and 15) and, subsequently, to
rescind the contract on
the basis that the unit constituted a breach on the
part of the vendor.  The air-conditioning unit cannot, therefore, in any event,
form the basis for refusing to grant specific performance.
<P>

329   	In this case, then, specific performance would not be
refused on the grounds that there existed defects in the title of the
property
so as to mean that the contract contained a misdescription of the property for
sale.  It is not the case here that the property
for sale "by reason of a
departure from the terms of the contract, is so materially altered in character
as to be in substance a
different thing from that contracted for": <i>Torr v
Harpur</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1940/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] NSWStRp 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2040%20SR%28NSW%29%20585" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 40 SR(NSW) 585</a> at 594 per Williams J.  Even if specific
performance were granted it is clear by the words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> that the grant of
specific performance and the alleged defect in title have to be causally
connected.  No such causal connection
can be found in the present
circumstances.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

330   	The Plaintiffs, therefore fail in their petition for
return of the deposit on the basis of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1).</a>
<P>

<b><i>Purchaser not entitled to rescind the contract</i></b>
<P>

331   	In accordance to that which I have already decided (see
above, paragraphs 166 to 309), namely, that the notice of termination
issued by
the Defendant was validly issued and did not constitute a repudiation of the
contract on the part of the Defendant, the
Plaintiff is not entitled to rescind
the contract.
<P>

332   	As I have concluded that it would not have been
inappropriate for the court at the suit of the Defendant vendor to order
specific performance of the contract for the sale of the property, my finding
as to this final point on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(1)</a> may not greatly matter.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55(2)</a></b>
<P>

333   	Since no relief is available to the Plaintiff under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 1</a> of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a>, it follows that no
relief is due under subsection 2.  The inclusion of the word "such" in
subsection 2 gives rise to the requirement
that not only must there be defects
in title not disclosed by the contract of sale, those defects must also be
capable of forming
the basis of a defence to an order for specific performance
of the contract for the sale of land.  I have earlier reached the conclusion
that the defects in title were not such as to persuade this court that it would
not have ordered specific performance of the contract,
at the suit of the
vendor if that had been sought. 
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55(2A)</a></b>
<P>

334   	Subsection 2A of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a>
is in much wider terms.  According to the terms of the subsection the court
may, if it thinks fit, order the repayment of any deposit
with or without
interest in every case where specific performance is not granted or in any
proceeding for the return of a deposit.
 This Court may order return of the
deposit notwithstanding the conclusion made above that this would have been a
case in which a
court could have ordered specific performance of the contract
as against the purchaser.  In the present case, the Plaintiff seeks
return of
the deposit in the further amended summons filed in court on 1 September 1999:
see <i>Huber v Conroy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20NSWLR%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 NSWLR 143</a> per Holland J at 149,151.  
<P>

335   	The subsection gives this Court a wide discretion to
grant the order sought if it is so minded.  The subsection can operate
even
where the contract for sale provides for the retention of a deposit where the
purchaser is in breach of an essential term of
the contract or any notice
issued under it, as does the contract in the present case (see clause 9 of the
contract [PX5 6]).  As
I wrote in <i>Terry v Permanent Trustee Australia
Limited</i> (1995) 6 BPR 14,091 at 14,105:
<P>

"This provision has been liberally interpreted.  It is not necessary that the
court find inequitable conduct on the part of the
vendor.  Rather, in  the
exercise of its broad discretion, the court should look at whether in all the
circumstances it could be
said that it is unjust an inequitable to permit the
vendor to retain the deposit forfeited on termination". 
<P>

336   	The onus lies on the purchaser to show that it is unjust
and inequitable for the vendor to retain the deposit: <i>Clarke v

82 WN(NSW) 326</a> Hardie J made an order for the return of a deposit under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A)</a>
in circumstances where, although the Plaintiff had not established that a
material and irremediable defect in title existed, the
court was still
unwilling to force the title on an unwilling purchaser. His Honour said of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A):</a>
<P>

"The language of the subsection,...., is appropriate to confer a wide
discretion in the court to order a refund of the deposit.
 It is clearly
available in cases in which the vendor's contractual right to forfeit the
deposit is otherwise completely unassailable":
at 335
<P>

338   	His Honour in that case reached the conclusion that
return of the deposit was appropriate on the basis that that the defects
in
title could only be proved or rectified in a "lengthy equity suit, and
accordingly that specific performance would not have been
ordered against the
purchaser": at 336. 
<P>

339   	A similar approach was taken in <i>Wilson v Kingsgate
Mining Industries</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%202%20NSWLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 2 NSWLR 713</a>, in which Wootten J decided that an
order should be made for the return of the deposit on the basis that it was
inequitable, in all
the circumstances of the case, that the vendor should
retain the deposit as against a willing and able purchaser.  In that case the
Plaintiff purchaser had failed in its application for specific performance of
the contract for sale of the property.  Wootten J referred
to the need to take
into account the reason for a deposit to be paid at all under the contract:
<P>

"The purpose of a deposit is that, in addition to being a part payment, it is
also an earnest to bind the bargain so entered into,

its forfeiture, a motive in the payer to perform the rest of the contract...

<P>

It is no doubt important that the court should not adopt an attitude in
ordering the return of deposits under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A)</a> which would weaken the proper
function of a deposit in providing a sanction for purchasers treating the
making and completion of
a contract with due seriousness and good faith.  On
the other hand there seems every reason to exercise the discretion in favour
of
a purchaser who was willing and anxious to complete, but lost his opportunity
through the temporary inadvertence of those he had
properly employed to act for
him.": p.735
<P>

340   	The effect of subsection 2A on the vendors right to
forfeiture of the deposit was further explained by Street CJ in <i>Lucas &amp;
Tait (Investments) Pty Limited v Victoria Securities Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%202%20NSWLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 2 NSWLR
268</a> at 272-3:
<P>

"The section was designed to provide relief to a purchaser against an unjust
and inequitable consequence of forfeiture of a deposit.
 It is clear enough
that at law a vendor's right to forfeit a deposit to himself in the event of a
purchaser's default bears no necessary
relation to the damages actually
suffered by a vendor.  At law a forfeited deposit could result in a vendor
making a profit which
in justice and equity he ought not to be permitted to
enjoy at the purchaser's expense.  In a complementary sense, an order for the
return of the deposit does not necessarily affect the vendor's right to sue a
defaulting purchaser at law and recover against him
such damages as the vendor
can prove.  The jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A)</a> does not give to a court an overall
discretionary supervision of monetary adjustments between parties to a contract
under which a
deposit was paid but which had been terminated.  A vendor who
forfeits a deposit in strict enforcement of his legal rights is not
to be
deprived of it under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A)</a> unless it is unjust and inequitable to permit him
to retain it".
<P>

341   	The question to ask, then, in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A)</a> is
whether the court is satisfied that there are special or exceptional
circumstances where it would be unjust or inequitable for
the vendor to retain
the deposit: <i>Terry v Permanent Trustee Australia Limited</i> (1995) 6 BPR
14,091; <i>Mearns v Parras Holdings Pty Ltd</i> (1994) NSW ConvR 60,025 per
Santow J at 60,033; also see <i>Lucas &amp; Tait (Investments) Pty Limited v

<P>

342   	From the authorities one is able to ascertain that the
court looks to matters such as "the conduct of the parties, especially
the
applicant, the circumstances which brought about the termination and
forfeiture, and the amounts at stake": <i>Terry v Permanent Trustee Australia
Limited</i> at 14,105.  The court considers matters connected with the contract
as well as the conscionability of the conduct of the parties
after contracts
are exchanged: see <i>Pratt v Hawkins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2032%20NSWLR%20319" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 32 NSWLR 319</a> at 324.
<P>

343   	For example, in <i>Mayer v Vitale</i>, a case in similar
circumstances to the present litigation, Kearney J wrote:
<P>

"This was a case of a purchaser refusing to complete by deliberate reliance on
grounds which I have held to be invalid.  In all
the circumstances it does not
seem to me that it is unconscionable on the part of the Defendants to exercise
heir right of forfeiture
of the deposit having regard to the circumstances
referred to in <i>McLaren v Lucas &amp; Tait Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%202%20NSWLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 2 NSWLR 268</a>
and other relevant authorities.  In my opinion the Plaintiffs' claim for return
of the deposit should not be granted": at 9172
<P>

344   	In the present case I am minded not to order that the
deposit be returned to the Plaintiff.  I have reached that conclusion
for the
following reasons.
<P>

345   	First, there has been no evidence before this court that
the Defendant vendor acted unconscionably in the circumstances of
the case.
The Defendant was willing and able to complete the contract at the time due for
performance.  In this regard, the present
case is not dissimilar to
<i>Socratous &amp; Anor. v Koo &amp; Anor</i> (1993) NSW ConvR 59,914, a case
in which McLelland CJ in Eq. wrote:
<P>

"There is no evidence or suggestion of any default, misconduct or unfair
dealing on the part of the Plaintiffs.  There is no evidence
that they acted
otherwise than in perfect good faith in their dealings with the Defendants.
The position is that the Defendants,
for their own reasons, deliberately took a
substantial risk, which on any objective view was a foolish one and against the
consequences
of which, at least so far as the Plaintiffs are concerned, there
is no basis for affording them discretionary relief.": at 59,918
<P>

346   	I find the absence of unconscionable behaviour on the
part of the Defendant to be a factor strongly against granting the
Plaintiff
relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A).</a>  
<P>

347   	Second, the "risk" that the Plaintiff took was to
structure their financial dealings in such a way that at the point in time
when
completion was to occur, the Plaintiff was unable to finance the purchase.
<P>

348   	As mentioned above (see paragraph 12), the funds
necessary for the purchase of the Parramatta road property were to be raised
out of the sale of a property at Mallet Street Camperdown by Carbest Pty
Limited.  It is evident that the sale of the Mallet Street
property did not
occur in time to provide finance to Gogard Pty Limited.  The sale of the
Camperdown property was subject to building
approval which, as of 23 February
1998 was not expected to be finalised until March 1998 [Minter affidavit 12 May
1998 para 17; PX5
65] (see paragraph 37).
<P>

349   	Carbest Pty Limited did attempt to arrange for bridging
finance after the notice to complete was issued.  Mercantile Mutual
informed Mr
Hayes that it had provisionally accepted the application for further loan
monies on 13 March 1998 [Hayes' affidavit 6
May 1998 annexure C page 45].
<P>

350   	However, at no time before 16 March 1998 did the
Plaintiff have the necessary finance arrangements in place to purchase the
Parramatta Road property.
<P>

351   	On 17 March 1998 Mr Parker and Mr Minter had a telephone
conversation.  In the course of that conversation, Mr Parker said
words to the
following effect:
<P>

PARKER:	"My client took a gamble in not having finance ready but when they
struck problems and we were not prepared to extend the
settlement time, my
client immediately organised its finances.  We now have a conditional
approval". (Minter affidavit 12 May 1998
para 30)
<P>

352   	The approval was, however, subject to approval by the
credit committee of the Mercantile Mutual AJ Mortgage Trust.  The mortgage
proposal was not approved by that that committee until 25 March 1998 [PX5 52].
By that time the contract for the sale of the Parramatta
property had been
validly terminated by the Defendant.
<P>

353   	Even though the result in <i>Pratt v Hawkins</i> (supra),
in which Young J cited the fact that the contract failed "because the purchaser
did not have enough money to complete it"(at
327) can be distinguished because
of other conduct of the purchaser arising in that case, it does stand as
authority for the proposition
that the financial readiness of the purchaser to
complete the contract on the date so agreed is a matter going to the discretion
of the court.  The present case is one in which "forfeiture of the deposit was
a contractual outcome the possibility of which the
purchaser incurred open-eyed
and as a matter of business in an arrangement in which each party incurred
risks": per Bryson J in <i>Smilie Pty Limited v Bruce</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d841" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) NSW ConvR
55-841</a> at 56,598.
<P>

354   	Third, whether the risk assumed by the Plaintiff was or
was not in the nature of a "gamble", it is at least clear from the
facts of
this case that it is not of a type similar to that of <i>Blacktown City Council
v Fitzgerald and Ors</i> (1990) NSW ConvR 59,032.  In that case Cohen J ordered
the return of a deposit in circumstances where "the Plaintiff had done all
that
it could to ensure that completion took place".  The Plaintiff in that case had
"forwarded the balance of the purchase price
to its solicitors upon being
advised that completion was to take place... The Plaintiff failed to complete
not because of any decision
to that effect, nor for any inability, but only
because of an omission on the part of its solicitors which turned out to have a
most
drastic result": at 59,038.
<P>

355   	In the present case, it cannot be said that the
Plaintiff's default was due to a mere administrative error.   While the
purchaser
may have been mistaken about the effect of the date of completion
contained in the contract, that cannot be a mistake that could
be said to have
lead to the failure of the Plaintiff to comply with the contract and especially
could not have said to have effected
the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the
notice to complete. 
<P>

356   	In <i>Clurstock Pty Ltd v Timanu Pty Ltd</i> at 57,831,
Young J wrote:
<P>

"...where the purchaser has been caught up in a situation through little fault
of his own or perhaps because of the fault of his
solicitor and has endeavoured
to do the decent thing, the Court will very often exercise its discretion in
his favour, notwithstanding
that this will have the effect of depriving the
vendor of the right to forfeit the deposit and notwithstanding that the making
of
such an order will lessen the importance of a deposit as an earnest that the
contract will be fulfilled.  However, merely because
a large amount of money is
involved and situations have arisen which were not contemplated by the
purchaser and make it inexpedient
for the purchaser to pursue the contract will
not usually be thought to be a sufficient reason why the parties' respective
rights
at law should not continue to apply"
<P>

357   	In the present case, then, the failure of the contract
was due to the Plaintiff's default and could not be said to have resulted
from
its unilateral mistake as to the effect of the inclusion of a date of
completion in the contract.
<P>

358   	Fourth, as has been found above, the Plaintiff purchaser
would not have had a defence to specific performance if an order
requiring such
were sought by the Defendant vendor.  In <i>Lucas &amp; Tait (Investments)</i>,
Street CJ decided that:
<P>

"If the court would not, in its discretion, specifically enforce the contract
[273] against the purchaser, then it may follow that
it would be unjust and
inequitable to allow the vendor to retain the deposit": at 272-273
<P>

359   	While the proposition does not automatically hold that
since specific performance of the contract would have been granted
therefore
the vendor is entitled to forfeiture of the deposit (that would be to ignore
the second limb of subsection 2A), it certainly
is a matter in favour of this
court declining to exercise its discretion to order that the deposit be
returned.
<P>

360   	Fifth, the deposit in this case is not in the nature of a
penalty: see <i>Lucas &amp; Tait</i> at 273;  <i>Terry v Permanent Trustee
Australia Limited</i> at 14,107.  In <i>Smilie Pty Limited v Bruce</i> (supra)
at 55-842, Bryson J wrote:
<P>

"Forfeiture of a deposit of a reasonable amount is not a penalty, and the
deposit of 10% was at the reasonable and customary rate
from which parties to
real estate contracts in New South Wales rarely depart".
<P>

361   	Sixth, it is evident that the Defendant has, subsequent
to issuing the notice of termination, resold the property for a higher
price
than that agreed under the then validly terminated contract with the Plaintiff.
This is a factor that weighs in favour of granting
the Plaintiff relief in
respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A):</a>  <i>Florencio Delgado v Walker Developments Pty Limited</i>
(Bryson J, NSWSC, 18 July 1989, unreported); also see <i>Terry v Permanent
Trustee Australia Limited</i> at 14,107.  However, in the words of Young J in
<i>Clurstock Pty Limited v Timanu Pty Limited</i> at 57,826, "the cases
indicate that that mere fact is not enough because of the twofold nature of the
deposit, one purpose of it
being to make sure the contract is binding": at
57,831.  It cannot be said, in the present circumstances, that the Defendant
sought,
by the resale, to make a windfall profit at the expense of an innocent
purchaser.  In that case, the profit made by the Defendant
from the resale of
the property is not enough to offset the considerations I have earlier noted;
see <i>Terry v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd</i> at 14,107-8 for a discussion
of the principles applicable in such cases.
<P>

362   	In all the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied
that this is not a situation where considerations of justice and fairness
render it appropriate to order a return of the deposit under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A).</a>  I reason
here as I did in <i>Terry v Permanent Trustee Australia Limited</i>: "In the
circumstance it was not unjust and inequitable for the Defendant to insist upon
the due performance of the contract and,
on the default of the Plaintiff, to
forfeit the deposit.  As the vendor was not seeking to make a windfall profit
at the expense
of an innocent purchaser, the financial benefit to the vendor
was not in the circumstances sufficient to justify an order for the
return of
the deposit".  I therefore decline to make the orders sought by the Plaintiff
in respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55(2A).</a>
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

363   	The Defendant is entitle to forfeiture of the deposit.
<P>

<b>Question Six:  The Cross-Claim for Damages, Reasonable Costs and
Expenses</b>
<P>

364   	By cross-claim contained in the Further Amended
Cross-Claim filed 9 July 1999, the Defendant claims to be due reasonable
costs
and expenses as provided for in clause 9.3.1 of the contract and otherwise
arising out of the Plaintiff's (Cross-Defendant's)
failure to complete the
contract.  The cross-claim also seeks damages against the Plaintiff.
<P>

365   	Clause 9 of the contract allows only one of the forms of
relief sought by the Defendant (Cross-Claimant).  Clause 9.3 allows
either
relief by way of recovery of deficiency on resale and reasonable costs and
expenses or damages for breach of contract.  It
seems clear that the Defendant
must elect to pursue one or the other form of relief: Butt at 482-3.
Furthermore, Butt observes that
"having elected to pursue one right, the vendor
cannot resile from the election and choose the other if it eventuates that the
course
 chosen is the less advantageous one";  at 482.  No submissions were
made on behalf of the Defendant Cross-Claimant in respect of
a claim for
unliquidated damages.  Although not expressly made, it appears that the
Defendant Cross-Claimant has elected to pursue
relief under clause 9.3.1:  see
<i>Jampco Pty Limited v Camerson (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20391" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 391</a> (a case where
the opposite conclusion was made).  In those circumstances I can dismiss the
claim for unliquidated damages by virtue
of the doctrine of election.  In any
event, since the Defendant obtained a higher price on resale of the property,
and since the
basic principle is that the measure of damages is the difference
between the contract price and the value of the property at the
date of the
breach (see <i>Rossco Developments</i> at 6), the Defendant would not be
entitled to such damages.  Furthermore, no evidence was proffered  as to any
consequential damage
suffered by the Defendant.
<P>

366   	The decision of this court to allow the Defendant to
retain the deposit cannot affect the Defendant's rights to sue under
the
contract:
<P>

"... it will still remain open to the vendor to sue the defaulting purchaser
and recover against him whatever damages may be due
to the vendor at law in the
event of the contract having gone off through the purchaser's breach.  The
ordinary principles of contract
law and of damages stand untouched by this
section except in so far as it operates to qualify the ordinary right of a
vendor to forfeit
and retain a deposit": <i>Lucas &amp; Tait</i> at 273 per
Street CJ.
<P>

367   	Furthermore, there was no evidence before me to suggest
that the Defendant would not have been entitled to resell the property
at
general law.  Since the notice of termination was validly issued and there are
not other circumstances that would offend the conscience
of this court, the
decision to resell was within the rights of the Defendant.
<P>

<b>The contractual right to resell and to claim reasonable expenses</b>
<P>

368   	Clause 9.3 of the contract reads:
<P>

<b>"9	Purchaser's default</b>
<P>

If the purchaser does not comply with this contract (or a notice under or
relating to it) in an essential respect, the vendor can
terminate by serving a
notice and after the termination - 
<P>

...
<P>

9.3	sue the purchaser either -
<P>

9.3.1	where the vendor has resold the property under a contract made within 12
months after the termination, to recover -
<P>

&#183;	the deficiency on resale (with credit for any of the deposit kept or
recovered and after allowance for any capital gains
tax payable on anything
recovered under this clause); and
<P>

&#183;	the reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the purchaser's
non-compliance with this contract or the notice and of resale
and any attempted
resale; or
<P>

9.3.2	to recover damages for breach of the contract."
<P>

369   	The Defendant in the present case has "resold the
property under a contract within twelve months after the termination" of
the
Gogard Contract.  The only claim made by the Defendant is in respect of the
second limb of clause 9.3.1, namely, the "reasonable
costs and expenses arising
out of the purchaser's non-compliance with this contract or the notice and of
resale and any attempted
resale".  
<P>

370   	The "purchaser's non-compliance with this contract or the
notice" refers to the opening words of clause 9 being a non-compliance
with
"this contract (or a notice under or relating to it) in an essential respect".
I have earlier decided that the Plaintiff did
not comply with the notice to
complete in an essential respect and that the Defendant validly terminated the
contract.
<P>

371   	The sub-clause, then, provides for the recovery of costs
incurred arising out of:
<P>

1.	the purchaser's non-compliance with the contract; and
<P>

2.	the purchaser's non-compliance with the notice; and
<P>

3.	the resale; and
<P>

4.	any attempted resale.
<P>

372   	The amounts claimed in the Further Amended Cross-Claim
pursuant to clause 9.3.1 of the contract included sums expended on
legal costs,
financial costs, council rates, water rates, land tax and risk insurance
[Further Amended Cross-Claim, 9 July 1999].
 The Defendant subsequently
accepted that all expenses other than legal expenses incurred by the Defendant
cannot be claimed as reasonable
costs and expenses.  The Defendant thus admits
that the expenses claim amounts only to $4,886.63 being:
<P>

(a)	$2,794 for legal costs incurred under the failed sale to the Plaintiff;
<P>

(b)	$2,092.63 for legal costs incurred by the Defendant in reselling the
property.
<P>

373   	As to the other claims, while formally pressed by the
Defendant Cross-Claimant, the Defendant acknowledges that the principles
in
<i>Rossco Developments Pty Limited v O'Halloran and Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2029%20ACTR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 29 ACTR 1</a>
allow only the legal expenses in this case to be claimed under clause 9.3.1.

<P>

374   	In that case, Blackburn CJ, obiter, considered a clause
that provided for the recovery of "all expenses on of and incidental
to any"
resale of the property as liquidated damages.  Out of a raft of claims made by
the vendor in that case, only those costs
arising out of the retainer of a land
agent in connection with the advertisement and exhibition of the property for
resale and the
legal costs associated with the resale were said to be "of and
incidental to the resale".
<P>

375   	Following the principles in <i>Rossco Developments</i>,
only the amount of $2,092.63, being legal costs arising from the resale can be
claimed by the Cross-Claimant as costs arising from
the resale of the
property.
<P>

376   	Clause 9.3.1 is wider than the clause under consideration
in Rossco Developments.  The second paragraph of clause 9.3.1 allows
the vendor
to claim costs arising out of the non-compliance with the original contract for
sale or notices issued under it.  It is
clear, then that the amount of $2,794,
being legal costs arising out of the Cross-Defendant's non-compliance with the
contract is
also validly claimed by the Cross-Claimant.  As to the other
expenses claimed, it cannot be said that these arise out of the
Cross-Defendant's
non-compliance and cannot be said to be payable to the
Cross-Claimant in this case.
<P>

377   	As to costs arising out of any attempted resale, since
there was in this case no attempted and subsequently aborted resale,
no issue
in the present case.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

378   	The costs and expenses then due to the Cross-Claimant
amount to $4886.63 .
<P>

<b>Set-off as against the forfeited deposit</b>
<P>

379   	Since I have decided that the vendor is entitled to
forfeiture of the deposit, a question arises as to whether the purchaser
should
further be required to settle the vendor's costs and expenses recoverable under
clause 9 of the contract and recover those
in addition.  If that were the case,
the vendor would be able to retain the deposit monies and in addition would be
able to recover
an amount for reasonable costs and expenses.  The alternative
is that the reasonable costs and expenses of the vendor be satisfied
out of the
deposit monies.  In that case, the purchaser would be required to compensate
the vendor only to the extent that the reasonable
costs and expenses outweighed
any forfeited deposit monies.
<P>

380   	In <i>Carpenter v McGrath</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 39</a>, Clarke
JA wrote at 44-45 (also see Sheller JA at 63):
<P>

"The general principle which applies to the awarding of damages for the breach
by a purchaser of a contract of sale of real estate
is that the injured party
is to be place in the same situation, so far as money can do, as if the
contract had been performed...
 For this reason it has long been accepted that
if the deposit is forfeited it must be set-off against any damages claimed.
That
rule does not simply apply to a deficiency on re-sale of the property but
applies to all general damages allowed pursuant to the
principle in <i>Hadley v
Baxendale</i>"
<P>

381   	In cases such as the present, where the claim for damages
under clause 9.3.1 is directly connected with the purchaser's failure
to
complete, the damages must be set off as against the forfeited deposit monies.
To the extent that the amount of the deposit exceeds
the amount of the damages,
the purchaser is not required to pay more than the forfeited deposit: see also
"The Standard Contract
for the Sale of Land in New South Wales", para 9.177 at
499.
<P>

<b>Set-off against profit on the resale</b>
<P>

382   	The Plaintiffs argue that, since the property has been
resold (that is, on 18 March 1998) and that since there was no deficiency
on
resale (rather that it was resold for a price some $152,500 more than the
original asking price), the Defendants are not entitled
to costs and
expenses.
<P>

383   	The Defendant admits that there is some divergence on the
authorities as to whether the vendor is entitled to reasonable
expenses in
circumstances such as the present.  The issue is whether, where there has been
a surplus on resale, the profit gained
from the resale should be taken into
account in ascertaining whether there has been any expense incurred by the
vendor.  The question
raised is whether the court should set off the profit
made under the resale as against the expenses incurred by the vendor in the
first unsuccessful sale.
<P>

384   	There is conflicting authority on this point.  In
<i>Mallet v Jones</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1959/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] VicRp 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%20VR%20122" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] VR 122</a> the Full Court of the Victorian Court of
Appeal found that the profit was to be set off as against the expenses of the
failed sale.
 On the other hand, in <i>Rossco Developments</i>, Blackburn CJ of
the A.C.T. Supreme Court allowed the vendor to recover reasonable expenses in
addition to the profit from any resale.
<P>

385   	It is unnecessary here for me to choose between the
divergent authorities.  Since I have decided that the costs and expenses
are to
be set off against the forfeited deposit, it is unnecessary for me to decide
whether, in any case, the costs and expenses
should be set off as against the
profit on resale.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

386   	The issues in this case have been resolved as follows:
<P>

(1)	The completion date was that date contained in the express terms of the
contract.  There are no grounds for rectification in
this case.
<P>

(2)	The Defendant's entitlement to issue a notice to complete making time of
the essence arose out of the breach on behalf of the
Plaintiff of a
non-essential term of the contract as to time, namely, the date of completion.
The Defendant was otherwise entitled
to issue a notice to complete since it was
not in breach of the contract at the time that the notice was so issued and was
not otherwise
disqualified from so issuing the notice.
<P>

(3)	Non-compliance with the notice to complete on the part of the Plaintiff
entitled the Defendant to issue a notice of termination.
 The contract was
validly terminated by the Defendant.
<P>

(4)	The Plaintiff was not, therefore, entitled to any damages for wrongful
termination or breach on the part of the Defendant.
<P>

(5)	The Defendant is entitled to forfeiture of the deposit according to clause
9 of the contract.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55(1)</a>,(2) and (2a) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i>
1919</a> do not avail the Plaintiff.
<P>

(6)	The Defendant is entitled to reasonable costs and expenses pursuant to
clause 9.3.1 of the contract.  Those damages are, however,
to be satisfied out
of the deposit monies. 
<P>
