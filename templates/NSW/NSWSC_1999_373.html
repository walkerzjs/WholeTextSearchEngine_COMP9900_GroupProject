<b>1293 of 1999		LAND AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT </b>
<P>

<b>CORPORATION PTY LTD -v- </b>
<P>

<b>TATEBROOK PTY LTD</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER</b>:  By summons filed on 8 February 1999, the
plaintiff Land and National Development Corporation Pty Ltd (referred to in
these proceedings
as "Land") seeks an order that the statutory demand dated 19
January 1999, served upon it by the defendant Tatebrook Pty Ltd (to
which I
shall refer to as "Tatebrook") be set aside, pursuant to the provisions of
S459G(1) of the <i>Corporation Law</i>, or alternatively pursuant to the
provisions of S459J of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2  	That statutory demand seeks payment by the plaintiff to the
defendant of the amount of $1,739,758.56, being the amount of the
debt
described in the schedule.
<P>

3  	The schedule contains the following description of the amount of
that debt: 
<P>

<b>The moneys outstanding as at 17 September 1997 under a loan and shareholders
agreement between the company, the creditor and others,
dated 13 January 1995,
being $2,339,758.56 less an amount of $600,000 of that debt, which has been
assigned by the creditor to Idogear
Pty Ltd ACM 008592434.</b>
<P>

4  	The loan and shareholders agreement entered into between the
parties on 13 January 1995 provided for the loan by the defendant
to the
plaintiff to be repaid by 18 November 1997. However, on 17 September 1997,
there was entered into between the parties a further
deed described as
"Tatebrook Deed of Release."  Clause 3 of that deed provides:
<P>

<b>On and from the date of, but subject to completion of, the Lidoform Share
Sale Agreement, Tatebrook releases Land from its obligations
to pay to
Tatebrook the amount in Item 2 of the schedule release.</b>
<P>

5  	Also on 17 September 1997, the parties and others entered into a
deed described as "Deed of Acknowledgment", which contained
provision in clause
13.3 concerning the Lidoform Share sale Agreement.  That clause provides,
"Notwithstanding any provision of the
Lidoform share sale agreement to the
contrary, completion of the Lidoform Share Sale Agreement is conditional on and
subject to"
- and there then follow six subparagraphs, of which those relevant
to the proceedings before me are the following:
<P>

<b>(a)	completion of the first stage by the first stage  completion date,
including the release of the land debt to Viebell.</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	compromise of the tax claims in an amount and on terms satisfactory to
contractors by the second stage completion date.</b>
<P>

6  	Various of the phrases used in those subparagraphs are the
subject of definition in the interpretation provisions contained
in clause 1 of
the Deed of Acknowledgment of 17 September 1997.
<P>

7  	There have been a number of facts agreed to between the parties
to the proceedings, set forth in a document headed "Statement
of Agreed Facts",
which will be admitted into evidence as an exhibit in the present
proceedings.
<P>

8  	Amongst those agreed facts are the acknowledgment of the loan and
the provision for its repayment (to which I have already referred)
the release
contained in clause 3 of the Tatebrook Deed of Release (which I have set forth)
and the fact that completion of the Lidoform
Share Sale Agreement was
conditional on, and subject to, the satisfaction of each of the six conditions
contained in clause 13.3
of the Deed of Acknowledgment.
<P>

9  	Item 4 of the Statement of Agreed Facts is as follows: 
<P>

<b>The only basis on which it is said that there is a genuine dispute between
the parties in relation to the debt the subject of the
statutory demand, is in
relation to the effectiveness of the release.  In these proceedings Tatebrook
contends that conditions (a)
and (e) of the six conditions in the Deed of
Acknowledgment.</b>
<P>

<b>Have not been satisfied, with the consequence that Land's debt to Tatebrook
was not released, and remains payable as alleged in the
Statutory Demand.  Land
contends that conditions (a) and (e) have been satisfied, or that any breach
has been waived.</b>
<P>

10  	It will be appreciated that in the present proceedings it is
necessary for the plaintiff only to satisfy the Court that there
is a genuine
dispute between it and the defendant about the existence or the amount of the
debt to which the demand relates.  It
is not necessary for the plaintiff to
satisfy the Court that it must of necessity be successful in ultimately
resisting the claim
of the plaintiff for the amount of the debt.
<P>

11  	I would here interpolate that the proceedings have been
conducted upon the basis that the entitlement of the plaintiff to have
the
demand set aside is grounded upon the existence of such a genuine dispute, and
that the plaintiff has not, at the hearing of
the summons, sought to rely upon
the provisions of S459J of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, which relates to the
setting aside of a statutory demand if the court is satisfied that, because of
a defect in the demand, substantial
injustice will be caused unless the demand
is set aside, or that there is some other reason why the demand should be set
aside. 
The plaintiff grounds its present claim for relief exclusively upon the
existence of a genuine dispute as to its indebtedness to
the defendant.
<P>

12  	Accordingly, it becomes necessary to consider whether  the
plaintiff has established that the release of the debt has taken
effect, or
whether there are grounds upon which it can be genuinely argued that that
release has taken effect.
<P>

13  	Unless each of the six conditions set forth in the Deed of
Acknowledgment has been satisfied, then it is conceded by the plaintiff,
under
the terms of the Statement of Agreed Facts, that the release does not take
effect.
<P>

14  	There is no dispute as to the satisfaction of four of those
conditions.  It is submitted however, on the part of the defendant,
that
conditions (a) and (e) of those six conditions have not been fulfilled.  If
that be so, then the release has not taken effect,
and there is no genuine
dispute as to the indebtedness of the plaintiff.  It becomes necessary
therefore to proceed to consideration
of conditions (a) and (e) in clause 3.3
of the Deed of Acknowledgment.
<P>

15  	The first of the conditions in subparagraph (a) refers to
completion of the first stage by the first stage completion date.
 I have
already referred to the fact that those phrases are defined in the
interpretation provisions of the deed contained in clause
1.  The first stage
completion date as so defined was 31 October 1997.
<P>

16  	The sale of certain shops, known as the Gordon shops, was one of
the matters comprised in the first stage.  It is common ground
between the
parties that the sale of the Gordon shops did not occur until after 31 October
1997.  Indeed, it did not occur until
3 December 1997.
<P>

17  	On its face, therefore, the requirement of condition (a) has not
been satisfied.  However, it is submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff that there
has been a waiver in respect to that requirement.  That is, the plaintiff
submits that the defendant has waived
compliance by the plaintiff with the
requirement of condition (a).
<P>

18  	The argument concerning such a waiver is a somewhat complicated
and technical one.  It relates to the completion of the Idogear
Deed of
Assignment.  Clause 3 of that Deed of Assignment is said to have taken place,
even though the requirement relating to the
completion of the Gordon shops had
not been fulfilled.
<P>

19  	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the two
requirements were inter-related, being the requirement of the completion
of the
Gordon shops by a specified date, and the assignment under clause 3 of the
Idogear Deed of Assignment.
<P>

20  	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the defendant
has allowed the completion of the Idogear Deed of Assignment,
and by doing so
has effected a waiver of the fulfilment of condition (a) of the Deed of
Acknowledgment.
<P>

21  	The evidence upon which the plaintiff relies to support the
assertion that the Idogear deed has been completed - a completion
which it is
submitted would otherwise have been impossible without the waiver by the
plaintiff of condition (a) - is grounded upon
the letter dated 18 November 1998
from Woden Contractors Pty Ltd to the defendant.
<P>

22  	That letter is on the letterhead of Woden Contractors Pty Ltd.
It is signed by one Doug Fryer, described as director  - presumably
a
"director" of Woden Contractors Pty Ltd.  It is addressed to a number of
companies, and headed "Attention Alex Brinkmyer."  (It
should here be recorded
that  Mr Brinkmyer appears to be the principal of the plaintiff company, and he
has sworn the chief affidavits
on behalf of the plaintiff in the present
proceedings.)
<P>

23  	It refers to a without prejudice meeting on 13 October 1998, and
includes in the penultimate paragraph the following:
<P>

<b>We summarise the current status of transactions contemplated by the Deed of
Acknowledgment and associated documents, using the headings
and defined terms
used in the Deed of Acknowledgment for convenience on the attachment to this
letter.</b>
<P>

24  	The attachment is headed "Attachment, Deed of Acknowledgment;
Summary of Current Status."  It includes in Item 12 of the attachment
under the
heading "Land Loan Deed of Release" the following; "The release in the Land
Loan Deed of Release is conditional upon completion
of the Lidoform Share Sale
Agreement."  It contains in Item 4 the following under the heading "Land Group
Shares in Lidoform":
<P>

<b>4.1	Land AWB and JB entered into the Lidoform Share Sale Agreement as
vendors in favour of contractors or its nominee as purchaser
on 17 September
1997.  In relation to that agreement:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	Conditions precedent 13.3, (a), (c) (e) and (f) of the Deed of
Acknowledgment have not been satisfied.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	The conditions precedent in completion of the Lidoform Share Sale
Agreement set out in clause 13.3 (a) (c) and (e) of the Deed
of Acknowledgment
can no longer be satisfied, as timing requirements relating to those conditions
precedent are not capable of being
satisfied.</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	The release in clause 13.4 of the Deed of Acknowledgment has not taken
effect.</b>
<P>

25  	The letter to which that document is an attachment, concludes by
saying, "This letter and the attachment do not waive, limit
or vary any rights
Wodens may have under the Deed of Acknowledgment, or any other document
referred to in or contemplated by it".
<P>

26  	It should be here observed that that letter is not a letter from
the defendant.  An attempt has been made on the part of the
plaintiff to
establish some close relationship between the defendant and Woden Contractors
Pty Ltd, which company which was a party
to a number of the deeds to which I
have already referred, and which is the entity referred to in those deeds as
"Contractors".
<P>

27  	Even if the letter and its attachments could be relied upon as
somehow binding the defendant, it seems to me that the express
terms of the
letter and the attachments clearly reveal that there was no waiver by either
Contractors, or, if Contractors could speak
for the defendant, by the
defendant.
<P>

28  	I have been taken to abundant authority concerning the law of
waiver.  What is absolutely clear is that waiver is an intentional
act, and
cannot arise in the face of express opposition by the alleged waiving party to
the effecting of such a waiver.  
<P>

29  	It is quite apparent that there has been no waiver by the
defendant of compliance by the plaintiff with the  condition (a),
an essential
condition to the release that the plaintiff asserts has taken place.
<P>

30  	That conclusion of itself is sufficient to dispose of the
present proceedings.  However, for the sake of completeness I should
also refer
to condition (e).
<P>

31  	It is common ground between the parties that the tax claims have
not been compromised at all, let alone to the satisfaction
of Contractors.
However, it is submitted on the part of the plaintiff that condition (e) either
ceased to be operative or, if it
were operative, compliance with it was waived.
The basis of that submission is that the defendant failed to use reasonable
endeavours
to achieve a compromise with the Australian Tax Office.
<P>

32  	There has been placed in evidence versions, asserted by
deponents on behalf of the plaintiff, and disputed by a deponent on
behalf of
the defendant, concerning what are said to have been the attempts or efforts
made either by the plaintiff or by the defendant
to achieve some compromise
with the Australian Taxation Office.
<P>

33  	It does not seem to me however, that those disputed
conversations are determinative of whether there has been a waiver by the
plaintiff of compliance with the condition (e), which has not been
fulfilled.
<P>

34  	Once again, waiver must be an intentional act on the part of the
party or entity which is asserted to have waived, as here,
compliance with an
express provision in a contract. The conversations which are asserted by one
deponent, and disputed by the other
deponent, do not of course constitute any
evidence that there has been a waiver by the defendant of compliance with
condition (e).
<P>

35  	Indeed, it seems to me that, to the extent that there was an
obligation upon anyone to be the moving party in attempting to
achieve a
compromise of the tax claims, the obligation rested primarily upon the taxpayer
itself.  That the taxpayer undertook that
obligation, emerges from the items of
correspondence in that regard, which have been placed in evidence in the
present proceedings.
<P>

36  	It also appears that the original offer put by the taxpayer was
for payment of $200,000, whilst the Australian Taxation Office
countered with a
requirement for payment of $1,665,847.10.
<P>

37  	Having regard to the great divergence between those amounts, it
does not seem to me that the failure of a compromise to be
reached can be in
any practical sense placed at the door of the defendant, even if, as the
plaintiff asserts, the defendant was responsible
for not pursuing negotiations
with the Taxation Office, or for discouraging the plaintiff from pursuing those
negotiations.
<P>

38  	The taxpayer itself, being neither the plaintiff nor the
defendant, was of course the entity which had the primary obligation,
if it
wanted to compromise the tax claims, to continue its negotiations with the
Australian Taxation Office.
<P>

39  	I not satisfied that the plaintiff has established that the
conduct of the defendant in regard to the tax claims had the result
which the
plaintiff submits, of constituting a waiver of the requirement contained in
condition (e).  As I have already observed,
for the plaintiff to succeed in
establishing that the release took effect, the plaintiff must establish that it
is somehow absolved
from compliance with both of conditions (a) and (e).
<P>

40  	In my conclusion, it has not established in the case of either
of those conditions, that it is absolved from compliance.  That
being so, the
release has not taken effect.
<P>

41  	It follows therefore that there is, and can be, no genuine
dispute as to the liability of the plaintiff to pay the amount in
the statutory
demand.  A accordingly I propose to dismiss the summons.
<P>

(Mr Simpkins requested that it be noted that there were some arguments which he
put in relation to clause 13.3 (E); they being questions
of constructions of
the agreements, the question of the separate contact of 21 October, and the
inability of the party to rely upon
its own wrongful conduct.)
<P>

 
<P>

(Mr Simpkins indicated that he wished to make application pursuant to S419 F
for six weeks extended time for compliance.)
<P>

 
<P>

(Mr Leeming indicated that he would be consenting to the application to extend
time by six weeks, provided that the plaintiff gave
an undertaking not to
dissipate any of its assets during that period.  Discussion ensued.  Mr
Simpkins gave no undertaking.)
<P>

 
<P>

42  	<b>MASTER</b>:  I make the following orders:  
<P>

1.	I order that the summons be dismissed.  
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.  
<P>

43  	Mr Simpkins, your client will have seven days.
