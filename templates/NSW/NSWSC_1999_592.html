<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter the prisoner was indicted
before me on Monday last for the murder of one Cuong Van Dao (hereafter
referred to by me as the deceased) who died on 28 June 1994 at Bankstown.  When
indicted he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty
to manslaughter.  The Crown
accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment and the learned Crown
Prosecutor indicated
the basis of the acceptance of the plea was on the basis
of an unlawful and dangerous act.  The act relied upon was a hitting of
the
deceased by the prisoner with a baseball bat.  The deceased, it appears, died
some days later from complications received as
a result of a series of assaults
on him by the prisoner and other persons in a fight that took place in the
precincts of the Bankstown
RSL Club after a concert which a number of
Vietnamese attended.  This was on 28 May 1994.  The deceased was conveyed to
hospital
but died on 28 June 1994 from pneumonia which was caused by the
injuries received in the assaults.  Dr Ellis, the pathologist, has
stated in
his report that the antecedent cause of death was a severe head injury.  The
basis of the Crown case against the prisoner
was that he with others was
engaged in a common criminal enterprise to assault and attack the deceased.
<P>

2   	Historically the prisoner and the Co-accused were tried
before Finnane AJ and a jury between 23 June 1997 and 31 July 1997
and he was
convicted by the jury of murder but the jury could not agree in respect to the
Co-accused, Tuan Le.  The prisoner appealed
against his conviction and that was
upheld by the Court of Appeal on 1 October 1998 and a new trial was ordered.
His Co-accused,
apparently, was later re-tried and found not guilty.
<P>

3   	The prisoner was arrested in respect of this matter on 15
June 1994 and was bail refused until 3 March 1995 when he was granted
conditional bail.  He was again bail refused on 10 July 1997 to 16 October 1998
when he was again given conditional bail and he has
been on bail since that
time.  Consequently there is a period of custody of one year and eleven months
and twenty-six days that has
to be considered in any sentence that I impose.
<P>

4   	The facts in this case are very much in dispute and
consequently it is necessary for me to determine beyond reasonable doubt
the
facts on which I propose to sentence the prisoner and I should say it is by no
means an easy task because of certain conflicting
evidence.
<P>

5   	There are, however, some undisputed facts.  On the evening
of 28 May 1994 it appears some hundreds of people, mostly of Vietnamese
origin,
attended a concert at the Bankstown RSL Club.  The prisoner who gave evidence
before me on this plea described this as a
<i>"special night" </i>and he had
bought a ticket some time earlier.  The entertainment was provided by artists
including some from overseas and I accept
the evidence that this was a
legitimate well-conducted evening until the series of events occurred.
<P>

6   	The deceased, I should state, from the post-mortem
photographs and from his weight, was a very small man weighing only 37 kilos.
He attended with his de facto wife Lucy (known as Lucky) Ahovelo and his nieces
Kim Linh Le and Kim Lien Le together with a group
of friends.  The prisoner was
present at some stage with his girlfriend and later, it appears, in the company
of young people including
his Co-accused.  It appears during the concert when
dancing was being undertaken someone from the group with which the prisoner was
associated approached the young Kim Linh Le, then a fifteen-year old girl, and
asked her to dance, which she did.  Although, when
spoken to, she initially
denied to police that she did in fact dance.  The deceased, on seeing this
occurring, told the young man
not to dance with her again and this caused some
annoyance on the part of the young Vietnamese man.
<P>

7   	It appears as the concert was ending the deceased suddenly
was struck by a chair by one of the guests at the function which
caused him to
fall down and bleed.  The evidence of the identity of that person is very much
in dispute.  Shortly after the deceased
left the concert, having been assisted
by other friends to the carpark, where he was attacked by a group of young men
who apparently
kicked and punched him and the prisoner who struck him on the
head with a baseball bat.  Things got out of control completely, it
would
appear, because shots were fired and another person was killed and one was
wounded.  The Crown concedes there is no association
of the prisoner with those
incidents.  A short time later a Suzuki Vitara motor vehicle driven by the
prisoner was seen speeding
off by an off-duty officer on the Hume Highway,
Yagoona and, apparently, went through a red light.
<P>

8   	When first spoken to by the police on the morning of 30 May
and thereafter on other occasions, the prisoner denied he was present
when the
shooting occurred and when the deceased was assaulted.  He was taken to the
police station where he was questioned and he
continued to deny any complicity
in the offence.  The investigation continued as did his denials.
<P>

9   	Eventually on 15 June 1994 the police attended at the home
of the parents of the prisoner where he was, in fact, residing at
the time,
with a search warrant.  After searching the premises he was then taken to the
Bass Hill police station.  He was asked by
police what he did at the concert
and amongst other things he said he had one schooner of Fosters.  He conceded
that he had a dark
jacket with patches.  He was then questioned extensively
about his movements and he continued to deny being present when the incident
occurred continually asserting that he had left before it happened.  He was
then told by the police that there were traces of blood
on the driver's side
door of the Suzuki vehicle and then he said that the man who went to the
hospital hit him.  He said, <i>"I walking past and he hit me, I went to hit him
back but there were too many people."</i>
<P>

10   	He then said that he went to the carpark and he <i>"was
looking for the man who hit me, I saw people fighting, I saw them kicking each
other".</i>  He then said he went looking for something to hit him with and
<i>"I found a baseball bat on grass in the street".</i>  He said that he
grabbed it and he went back and hit him, that is the deceased.  He said, <i>"I
hit him once, I kept trying to hit him but I miss, someone pull me off".</i>
He said he then went to the car and drove off with one of his friends and that
he threw the bat away when he was asked what he did
with the bat.
<P>

11   	He was further questioned about this and then he conceded
that he had obtained it from his car and didn't throw it away but,
in fact,
burned it.  He was then subjected to a record of interview in which he made
certain admissions.  It is those admissions
that are pressed on me by Mr Zahra,
his counsel, as a version I should accept.
<P>

12   	In the light of his denial of any involvement in the
matter originally and his deception to the police, one cannot approach
his
evidence with any great degree of confidence.  I sought from the learned Crown
Prosecutor what the Crown relied upon in respect
of this charge and she
informed me that the major Crown witness was the wife of the deceased, Lucy
Ahovelo.  She has provided the
police with a number of statements.  I have not
had the advantage of observing her under examination-in-chief or
cross-examination
and consequently it is difficult for me to determine the
issue as to whether she is to be accepted on the question on the finding
of
facts or whether I should accept the version of the prisoner or accept a
version that I determine as the facts.  I must emphasise,
of course, that it is
necessary for me in circumstances such as this to determine the facts upon
which I sentence the prisoner beyond
reasonable doubt.
<P>

13   	Lucy, as I shall refer to her, gave evidence of the
deceased telling the young Vietnamese man not to dance with his niece
and that
seems to be a common fact.  He said that his niece was not to dance as she was
only fifteen years of age.
<P>

14   	Apparently over the next hour after that minor incident
she said they continued to enjoy themselves.  In her first statement
she then
said she saw the Vietnamese boy, as I understand it, the one that her husband
had spoken to earlier, who was not the prisoner,
pick up a chair, lift it above
his shoulders and hit the deceased on the right side of his forehead, knocking
the deceased down.
 She said some of his friends, that is the deceased's
friends, started to fight with the boy and three other men who were sitting
with the boy stood up and entered the fray.  She described the first man as
being Vietnamese, wearing a black and white jacket with
two patches on each
sleeve made of imitation leather which, it appears, was the jacket being worn
by the prisoner on that night.
<P>

15   	She alleges, as I understand her evidence, that it was
that person who picked up a beer glass with a handle on it and hit
a man named
Hai, a friend of the deceased, on the head with that glass.  She said they all
started to fight and the bouncers came
and ordered everyone out.  Shortly
after, she said, they then decided to go home and they apparently left with a
number of other
Vietnamese friends, leaving the auditorium and entering the
carpark where she saw three of the Vietnamese boys that had been involved
in
the fight inside including the person who had hit the deceased with the chair
and she again identified that person as wearing
a jacket with black and white
patches and the one who had used the beer bottle which she earlier described as
a beer glass.
<P>

16   	She noticed that that individual was holding a baseball
bat in his right hand with some of it hidden up his sleeve.  She also
saw some
other individuals nearby.  She alleges then that the boy who was holding the
bat said to the deceased <i>"Fuck you, I'm going to kill you".  </i>
<P>

17   	He then held the baseball bat with two hands and hit the
deceased in the back of the neck with the bat.  She then jumped in
and punched
into them and swore at them and told them to leave the deceased alone.  In the
general melee it appears that a further
incident occurred, which I have
referred to earlier, where other persons were shot and wounded and she said she
was threatened. 
She then observed the deceased was on the ground and there
were seven Vietnamese standing over him and taking it in turns to kick
him and
the person she described as wearing the jacket that the prisoner says he was
wearing picked up the baseball bat, held it
in his right hand and hit the
deceased twice on the right side of his forehead whilst the deceased was lying
on the ground.  She
said the boys then ran away.  Her husband was unconscious
and bleeding from the head.  She said she believed she would be able to
recognise these persons.
<P>

18   	In relation to the statement in respect to the
identification of the prisoner, he was identified, it appears, by the clothing
he was wearing but in relation to the initial statement that she gave to the
police it was clear, as I understand the statement,
that the identification of
the person by the clothing he was wearing would lead to the conclusion from her
statement at that time
that it was not the prisoner who hit the deceased with
the chair but she apparently changed that later.
<P>

19   	A record of interview was then conducted with Lucy by the
police when she alleged that the man in the black and white jacket
with patches
picked up the chair and hit him over the head (p.4 of that record) and that, as
I understand the evidence, was contrary
to the material in her first statement.
She also alleged that the person said that he was going to kill her, contrary
also to what
she said earlier, alleging this occurred because she had thrown a
punch at him.
<P>

20   	When they went outside she said the man in the black and
white jacket picked up the baseball bat with both hands and smacked
it over the
deceased's head on the right side of the skull.  She was then shown some
computerised images, numbered FA 00153 question
198, and she said she
recognised the scars on the face.  She agreed it was the first image she did
the previous night and first of
all she said he was the man with the bat.  Then
she apparently became unsure of that and she answered question 206 that she was
trying
to think if that person in the image had the gun or the bat.  She was
then shown another image, number FA 00154, and she then said
he was the one
with the bat stating that she was quite positive and then she became quite
positive that FA 00153 was the man with
the gun.
<P>

21   	She made a further statement on 14 June 1994, which is
document 7 in the material tendered before me by the learned Crown
Prosecutor,
and she referred to her two other statements.  She referred to para 7 of that
statement and said that what was contained
therein was incorrect, that is the
first statement she made, as it was the person with the jacket with the patches
on the sleeves
who hit the deceased over the head with the chair.  She also
corrected her description of the person holding the gun which she said
had a
cream jacket.  She said this was not correct as the person with the gun was
wearing a dark jacket, not a cream one.  Then she
described her mistakes as
resulting from her suffering from shock as to what happened to her de facto and
his friends saying that
everything was happening too fast.
<P>

22   	The young niece Kim Linh Le provided a number of
statements to the police.  She confirmed in her statement of 29 May that
a man
she described as Cuong asked her for a dance and she said no.  As I have said
earlier, she said she didn't have a dance with
him but it turned out she in
fact did.  She said when the young man Cuong approached and asked her to dance
the deceased told him
to leave her alone.  She saw a fight break out.  She
didn't see how it started and she didn't see how her uncle was injured.  She
said outside later she saw a man with a baseball bat.  She was able to describe
him but the rest of the statement did not, in my
view, assist in the
identification of individuals responsible for these acts.  I think I should say
she was unable to describe him
adequately.
<P>

23   	In her second statement of 9 June 1994 she was then shown
certain people in a video.  Apparently some video had been taken
of the evening
in regard to this matter which the police obtained and she looked at the video
and really could not identify anyone
with certainty.  There was a line-up and I
think again she was unable to identify anyone and I do not think her evidence
carried
the matter any further.
<P>

24   	Tendered by consent were two further statements which
became Ex 3.  The first one from Branko Milosevic, who was a casual
bar
attendant who from an area in the building saw a commotion in the carpark and
together with another friend, John Seeto, walked
to the top of the alleyway to
the entrance to the carpark where he saw a blonde woman involved in a verbal
argument.  I take it this
was Lucy, although she was not specifically
identified.  He said she appeared to be with five people and the man she was
arguing
with was with about eight people.  He said the argument moved towards
Kitchener Parade which was on the boundary of the carpark.
 The blonde woman
was near the gate at the carpark.  She then went running back to the security
staff standing in the alleyway and
he said the group was just fighting and a
man was knocked to the ground and a man moved with a baseball  bat and looked
as though
he had come from Kitchener Parade and was swinging it at all and
sundry and he hit someone.
<P>

25   	A further statement was obtained from Do Lam.  He said
that when he and his girlfriend left the club having attended the concert
she
saw a Vietnamese man and his blonde girlfriend pushing and shoving three
Vietnamese men.  The blonde person swore at them and
a fight began.  He then
saw a man running from Kitchener Parade and saw a man hit a man causing the man
to fall to the ground and
he was kicked whilst there by the persons around him.
Then he saw another different man running back with a baseball bat hitting
him
on the head.  It appears by his observations that there were two persons
carrying a bat.  
<P>

26   	I have spent some time evaluating that evidence and, as
one would expect in such circumstances, the evidence was confused
and to some
extent contradictory.  As I said, the prisoner gave evidence before me but in
the light of his deception to the police
in attempting to disguise his being in
attendance at the time of that incident, leads me to treat his evidence with
considerable
reserve.  Putting his case at its highest he said a fight broke
out of which he had no part.  As he walked past the guy accidentally
hit him
(transcript p 4).  The guy is identified as the deceased.  He said that by that
time he had had a few drinks at the party
and when he was hit he got angry and
tried to hit him back.  He wasn't sure of how much he had had to drink, about a
few glasses,
he said.  He said he had drunk a few glasses before he went to the
concert and he said in his record of interview that he had had
a couple of
Fosters but he could not remember how many and he was drinking schooners.  I
note that in his statement to the police
after the incident he said he had only
had one schooner of Fosters that night.  
<P>

27   	He was interviewed by a psychologist, Mr Taylor, and he
told him he had only had three or four glasses of beer over a number
of hours
and that led Mr Taylor to conclude that there was no evidence he was
significantly intoxicated.  It is impossible on the
material before me to
determine with any degree of accuracy the amount of alcohol this man consumed
that night.  I am satisfied,
however, that he was not drunk as he would have me
believe in his evidence as justifying what he did.  I am satisfied that he may
well have been affected by liquor to some extent but I do not accept he was
significantly intoxicated.
<P>

28   	He told Mr Taylor the man hit him on his head with a fist.
He said he felt shocked and hurt and denied any knowledge of the
fight that
took place with the deceased in the auditorium and the reason for it and he
also denied hitting the deceased with the
chair.  I should add in the
circumstances I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that he was the
person responsible for hitting
the deceased on the head with the chair,
although there is evidence to suggest he was, which I will refer to.  He said
that when
he left the club he went and obtained the baseball bat which was
conveniently in the back of his motor vehicle, went back, saw them
fighting and
then he ran, he said he ran into the deceased and hit him.  He was holding the
bat two-handed and hitting him but denied
raising it above his head, alleging
when he swung it it was level with his chest.  At the time he said when he
struck the blow the
deceased was sitting on the ground and he believed he had
hit him somewhere on the head and he tried to hit him again but he missed.
When he was asked how he was feeling at this time he said, "That time I get
drunk, I don't know I am doing this".  He agreed that
he was very mad.  As I
have said, I do not accept for a moment that at the time he was drunk and he
did not know what he was doing.
 This was, I believe, a very deliberate act and
a determined act on his part.
<P>

29   	When first spoken to by the police he did not inform them
that he had this bat in the car for his own safety, rather, he said
he went
looking for a weapon and conveniently found it on the grass and disposed of it
as he was driving home.  That, of course,
all turned out to be untruthful.
When I sought from the Crown if the Crown disputed that he had got hit on the
way out, Madam Crown
said that she was not in a position to dispute this
version.
<P>

30   	In his evidence here he was asked about his conceding that
he drove off fast.  Mr Zahra submitted to me that his answer that
he told the
police he drove off fast goes to show that he was being truthful in his answers
because at the time of the record of
interview it was submitted he did not know
he had been observed driving fast by an off-duty police officer. I have
problems in accepting
that submission because he certainly knew before his
record of interview was taken that his driving had been observed when he had
gone through a red light.  He would have inferred from that that he had been
driving fast as he apparently was.
<P>

31   	When he was asked by Mr Zahra, <i>"What do you now wish to
tell the court about why you did this?"</i> his answer was, <i>"At the time I
was drunk and I didn't know anything about what I was doing, I was struck so I
just wanted to get back and hit the
guy back".</i>  As I have made it clear, I
reject that explanation.
<P>

32   	He agreed in cross-examination by the learned Crown that
that night he was wearing a very striking battle jacket with various
patches on
it and he agreed it met the description Lucy had given of the individual she
identified.  He said he had left with Tuan
Le and he did not see the deceased
hit over the head with the chair.  He said when he was struck the person was
arguing and fighting
with other people.  He agreed here that it was an
accidental punch but at the time he said he did not know if it was accidental
or
intentional.  He denied also that he hit anyone with a beer glass and he
alleged he did not know what they were fighting about.
<P>

33   	The evidence presented in this case is confusing.  If I
were to accept the evidence of Lucy then the prisoner's part of the
deceased's
death takes on a more sinister overtone than the prisoner alleges.  Indeed, if
one accepts her evidence he was the initial
aggressor, hitting the deceased
over the head with the chair,  but I have taken some time to refer to some of
the unsatisfactory
evidence of Lucy in her descriptions of the various
individuals who assaulted her husband that night.
<P>

34   	This was a very confused situation.  There were a number
of individuals involved in various activities.  It was night time,
everything
happened very quickly and even Lucy conceded she was shocked and hers is the
only identification that can be relied upon
other than the concession made by
the prisoner.  She was mistaken, apparently, in some aspects of her
identification and she gave
an explanation for that and I can understand it.
<P>

35   	This is a case, should it have gone to the jury, where
more extensive and careful directions would have to be given on the
question of
identification.  I bear those matters in mind and I have regard, particularly,
to <b>ss 115 and 116 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> and cases such as <b>Domican v The
Queen</b> and other authorities that are well known and established.  The
authorities require a very careful exposition of the problems of
identification
and I have regard, amongst other matters, to the fact that she was attempting
to recognise strangers, all young men
of Vietnamese appearance.  It is not
clear, as she was described as a blonde, that she herself was of Vietnamese
background.  It
was night time and I have no evidence as to the degree of
lighting in the carpark.  I have not seen her and I have not heard her
cross-examined.  I point out, of course, there are discrepancies between the
statements of the witnesses.  Despite misgivings I am
driven to conclude beyond
reasonable doubt that I should accept with modifications the version of facts
given by the prisoner.  I
do not accept, as I have said earlier, that he was
drunk but I accept that he consumed some alcohol which may have affected him to
some extent and caused him to lose his temper.  Furthermore and not without
some reservation, I accept that something happened to
him to lose his cool and
I accept for the purposes of sentence that he was struck accidentally as the
fight was taking place.  For
some reason not satisfactorily explained he
apparently lost his temper and, I would emphasise, without any real
justification in
the circumstances even if he was hit in the manner in which he
said he was.
<P>

36   	I find, however, without justification he determined to
hit the deceased with the baseball bat which he had conveniently in
the back
seat of his vehicle.  This necessitated him leaving the auditorium, crossing
the RSL carpark to where his car was parked
on the other side of Kitchener
Parade and obtaining from that vehicle the baseball bat.  He did not, in my
view, give a satisfactory
explanation of why he had it in his car.  He said it
was for his safety.  In using it as he did on this night it could hardly be
said he used it for his safety.  He, having obtained the bat, then deliberately
returned to the scene when the unfortunate deceased,
I find as a fact, was on
his knees having been seriously assaulted by the other individuals and then,
swinging the baseball bat,
hit him hard over the head.  Whether or not he
struck the deceased more than once as deposed to by Lucy, it was agreed by the
Crown
and Mr Zahra on behalf of the prisoner, that the pathologist who
conducted the post-mortem was not able to determine how many blows
were struck
to the head of the deceased and whether the injuries received were all the
result of being struck by the baseball bat
or could have resulted from being
hit by fists or boots.  Thus there is not sufficient credible evidence as to
whether he struck
the deceased more than once but even on his own version he
attempted to do so, whether or not he raised the baseball bat above his
head or
not I am satisfied that the blow he struck was one with considerable force with
the obvious intention of inflicting violence
on the deceased.
<P>

37   	The Crown, having accepted the plea of manslaughter, did
not submit he intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm at
the time.  In
any event, this is not a case when a person is hit in the heat of the moment
and then immediately retaliates, which
is often the case in circumstances such
as this.  Rather, it was in circumstances of a cold-blooded and deliberate act,
perpetrated
on a man who was already serious injured, on his knees and
defenceless and I have no doubt that it in some way contributed to his
death.
He also, by his flight from the scene, evidences, in my view, his own knowledge
of the unlawful act which he had perpetrated
and sought to escape detection and
he burnt the baseball bat so it could not be found.
<P>

38   	In pleading guilty, of course, he has conceded that the
act of hitting the deceased was unlawful and exposed the deceased
to a
significant risk of injury.  In my view there was absolutely no justification
for this activity and it has been in some sense
responsible, together with the
other assaults, for a death and calls for, in my view, severe punishment for
such a cowardly attack
on a defenceless man and, as I have said, a very small
defenceless man.
<P>

39   	Turning to the subjective facts: it is conceded by the
Crown that he was a man of good character, having no criminal convictions
and I
must have regard to that good character in any sentence I wish to impose.  It
is a man to see a man hitherto of good character
and background standing for
sentence for this offence.  I should say there is nothing in his background to
suggest that he is given
to violent acts and I have regard to the fact that
this act must be considered as an aberration and out of character.  Whilst it
is a tragedy for this prisoner, one must always bear in mind that it was a far
greater tragedy for the deceased who is now dead.
<P>

40   	It appears that at the time of this incident he had a
girlfriend and he was living in a residence with his parents and was
working.
It was said that he was a dutiful son and, indeed, he is at present living with
his parents with his de facto wife who now
has his child.  He appears to have
had a reasonable employment background and is working at the present time for
his brother in a
bakery at Dee Why.  There is no evidence that would suggest
that prior to or since this incident that he mixes with any gangs or
bad
company and I accept he is a moderate social drinker.
<P>

41   	His father gave evidence.  He said he was one of four sons
who came from Vietnam.  The prisoner, apparently, was born in Vietnam
and his
father said he was the most gentle of the members of the family.  He said he
appears to have been depressed and little wonder;
it would be surprising if
someone ... not to be depressed.  His father is of the view that he is contrite
and regrets what he has
done.  He believes it all happened because he was drunk
and he cannot do anything to help the family.  I am not satisfied that the
prisoner is contrite in the sense that he regrets having killed or having
contributed to the death of the deceased as he would have
me believe.  He was
asked about how he felt about what he had done and he said, <i>"I regret it
very much and this has been dragging on and hanging over my head for a long
time and I can't do anything to help my family
at the moment</i>".  It is to be
noted that in that answer there is no regret as to the death of the deceased.
Mr Zahra, no doubt perceiving the gap
in that answer, said this, "<i>How do you
feel about the person that has died?"</i> and the prisoner answered, <i>"I
regret it very much that he died and I'm so sorry that he died, I did not know
him at all."</i>  He then went on to say that he "<i>felt sorry and sympathy
for his wife and children, just as I would be going to gaol and leaving my wife
and children".</i>
<P>

42   	The regret that he has, in my view, results in the main
from the predicament in which he finds himself.
<P>

43   	I also have to take into account his plea of guilty.
Everyone who pleads guilty is entitled to have that matter considered
in
respect to the penalty to be imposed.  Pleas of guilty are to be encouraged and
judges are required to give due allowance for
such pleas.  It is important that
persons charged with criminal offences plead to those offences and be given an
appropriate allowance
for that.  Having said that, however, the amount of
allowance must depend on the particular circumstances in each case.  In this
case the prisoner admittedly was charged with murder initially and it was not
until a few days before his retrial was due to commence
that he was offered a
plea of manslaughter.  It is said, to his credit, that he immediately accepted
the offer of the plea.
<P>

44   	In assessing that matter one must bear in mind that he had
in fact been convicted of murder and in his mind would be a possibility
of that
occurring again.  In that respect the amount of allowance for the plea, in my
view, is somewhat marginal but I do make allowance
in that regard.  I do note
further that the trial in which he had been charged earlier took a number of
weeks and he is entitled
to discount because of the fact that he saved the
Crown the expense of a long and costly trial and I  make allowance for that.
<P>

45   	I also bear in mind that he has had this matter hanging
over his head for a number of years.
<P>

46   	It has been argued before me by Mr Zahra that I should
find special circumstances because this is the prisoner's first prison
sentence. That fact, of course, can amount to a special circumstance.  In this
case, of course, he has spent almost two years in
gaol so he is not going there
cold, so to speak, as would a person being convicted for the first time.  I
have considered that question.
 Having regard to the background of the prisoner
I do not believe there are any other bases for the application of special
circumstances.
 In my view, having regard to the sentence I propose to impose
on him as in relation to the additional term he will have more than
adequate
time to readjust into the community.  He has his family support.
<P>

47   	Concluding, I should say I do not find in the
circumstances special circumstances.
<P>

48   	The question of sentencing for manslaughter is extremely
difficult.  There is a wide divergence of facts that constitute the
offence of
manslaughter.  Whatever may be said about it, nevertheless it is one of the
most serious crimes in the criminal calendar
and the legislation has provided a
maximum sentence of twenty-five years penal servitude.
<P>

49   	I have had regard to statistics supplied by the Judicial
Commission in respect to manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous
act.  I
observed that in the sampling of 148 cases 84 per cent of those cases result in
a prison sentence.  Of a sample of 124 cases
the sentences range from eighteen
months to twenty years plus.  In respect to minimum terms, 69 per cent range
from three years to
eight years.  Whilst I have regard to them they give some
guidance but in the main little assistance because each case must be determined
on its own facts.
<P>

50   	The prisoner took part in what can be best described as a
gang attack on a defenceless man in a deliberate fashion and such
conduct will
not be tolerated by the courts.  It seems to be an offence that is becoming
quite common and persons who indulge in
such activity must realise that very
severe punishment will follow.  The question of public deterrence must loom
large in this case.
<P>

51   	The total sentence for this offence, in my view, bearing
in mind all the circumstances including his strong subjective facts,
lead me to
sentence you to penal servitude for six years.  I note the prisoner has, in
fact, spent two years in prison and I make
allowance for that fact.  The
sentence I propose is a term of four years to date from 31 May 1999.  It is to
consist of a minimum
term of three years to commence on 31 May 1999 and to
conclude on 30 May 2002 at which time he may be admitted to parole.  I have
imposed an additional term of one year to date from 31 May 2002 and I note that
I have in this sentence had regard to the fact of
pre-sentence custody of two
years.
