<P>

<b>4471/98	ADVANCED WASTE MANAGEMENT PTY LIMITED  -v-   JEFFREY FLETCHER</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>By summons filed on 30 October 1998 the
plaintiff Advance Waste, Management Pty Limited, seeks an order that the
Statutory Demand
served upon it by the defendant be set aside. That Statutory
Demand, which was served on 13 October 1998, seeks payment by the plaintiff
to
the defendant, Jeffrey Fletcher, of the sum of $5,129.93. That amount is
described in the schedule to the Demand as comprising
"refund of moneys paid
under agreement"  $5,000, and two items of interest, giving a total amount of
$5,129.93. 
<P>

2   	There were, in fact, two agreements entered into between
the plaintiff and the defendant. No point is taken, however, by the
plaintiff,
that the Demand refers only to one amount and one agreement.
<P>

3   	The defendant claims a refund of $2500 in respect of each
of the two agreements, each of which was dated 19 December 1997.
The scheme of
each of those agreements was that the defendant (described in the agreement as
"the grower") paid to the plaintiff
under each agreement the sum of $2,500. The
defendant was then to supply to the plaintiff a certain quantity of worms.
There was
an obligation placed upon the plaintiff to purchase worms and an
obligation placed upon the defendant to supply worms.
<P>

4   	The agreement -- I am speaking of a single agreement
because the two are in identical terms --- contains in clause 1 a definition
of
"commencement date",  which is said to be the date of first delivery of worms
to the depot, which was a date in the future not
less than 20 weeks from the
date of this agreement or otherwise as stated in writing by the company.  The
plaintiff is described
in the agreement as "the company".  
<P>

5   	Clause 6 A provides: 
<P>

The company agrees to purchase from the grower during the first term of this
agreement worms to the value of $15,000 based on the
fair market price of not
less than $30 per kilogram of marketable quality worms.
<P>

6   	Clause 9.3, provides, 
<P>

The grower guarantees to supply to the company regular deliveries of marketable
worms of a minimum value of $600 per kilo during
the term. If default of supply
occurs during the duration of the term, the company may serve upon the grower
notice to rectify the
breach within 28 days of that notice.  Failure to rectify
such breach within the 28 day period will permit the company to terminate
and
discontinue this agreement.  Allowance will be placed upon continuation of the
business, however it is the grower's responsibility
to notify the company of
such drawbacks to the growers placing if such an event did occur. 
<P>

7   	Clause 11, which is headed Default by the Company, is in
the following terms:  
<P>

In the event that the company breaches any of the its obligations under this
agreement and provided that an event of default has
occurred to purchase
marketable worms the grower may serve written notice upon the company requiring
the company to remedy the breach
within 28 days of the company's receipt of
such notice.  If the company fails to rectify the breach within the 28 day
period then
the company shall be liable to refund the moneys paid by the grower
to the company for the purchase of the worm farm less any amount
which has been
paid by the company to the grower or equipment supplied under the terms of this
agreement in full and final settlement
of any claim the grower has at that time
or may have in the future against the company arising out of any breach by the
company of
the terms of this agreement.
<P>

8   	Each of the two agreements bears upon the front page
thereof an endorsement placed there by the plaintiff company in the following
terms: "First delivery date as per contract 18 April 1998."
<P>

9   	The company did not place any order for the purchase of
worms with the defendant requiring delivery on 18 April 1998. Indeed,
it did
not place any order with the defendant for the purchase of worms throughout the
first five months of 1988. On 10 June 1998,
after the defendant had had a
number of conversations with Mr Kevin Joseph Murphy, the director of the
Plaintiff, in apparently the
latter part of March, April and May, Mr Fletcher
sent to the plaintiff a letter dated 10 June 1998. That letter purports to
constitute
notice of the nature contemplated by clause 11 of the agreement,
requiring the plaintiff company to rectify a breach of the agreement
and giving
28 days for such rectification. The letter contains the following:  
<P>

Please be advised that I hereby wish to serve notice upon your company
regarding the breach of our contracts dated 19 December 1997.
As no orders for
my worm stock have been forthcoming to date, I believe you, the company, have
defaulted on our agreement and I now
issue you with 28 days to rectify that
situation as stated in the contract. If at the expiry of 28 days you have not
issued me with
an order for our agreed 20 kilos of worms I will require a
refund of all moneys paid to you by myself, this being in the order of
$5,000.
Your nonwillingness to abide by your contract has left me disappointed and very
out of the pocket.  I hope that you will
now fulfill your obligation under the
contract and refund to me my up front costs.
<P>

10   	Subsequently a letter was sent by the solicitors for the
defendant to the plaintiff, dated 4 September 1998, requesting refund
of the
$5,000 paid by the defendant to the plaintiff and giving notice of an intention
to serve a Statutory Demand in the event that
that amount were not paid.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff, on 28 September 1998, sent a letter
apparently to all its growers (that is, to all the persons with whom it
had
entered into an agreement of the nature of that with the defendant), inviting
their attendance at a meeting to be held on 10
October 1998, and seeking to
have each of  those growers release the plaintiff from what is described in the
letter as the "contingent
liability" which the plaintiff considered had arisen
as a result of the effect of clause 11 of the agreement.
<P>

12   	On 9 December 1998 Mr Murphy left a recorded message on
the defendant's telephone answering machine. The following day the
defendant
sent a letter to the plaintiff referring to that telephone message. It would
appear that, although there were a number
of conversations between the
defendant and Mr Murphy, on behalf of the plaintiff, they were all telephone
conversations and that
those two gentlemen had never actually met in person.
<P>

13   	The Statutory Demand claims a refund of the totality of
the two amounts of $2,500 paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.
That refund
is sought by the defendant pursuant to the terms of clause 11 of the contract,
the defendant asserting that, in consequence
of a breach by the plaintiff and
the notice given by the defendant by the letter of 10 June 1998 and the
nonrectification of that
breach, the provisions of clause 11 are brought into
operation, and that, as a result, the plaintiff is obligated to repay to the
defendant the moneys paid by the defendant totalling $5,000.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff, however, submits that no breach of the
agreement has occurred which can call into operation the provisions
of clause
11. It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the obligation upon
the defendant, as the grower, is to provide
to the plaintiff a minimum quantity
of $600 worth of worms per month during the term of the agreement, but that the
obligation upon
the plaintiff company is merely to purchase, within the first
term of the agreement, worms to the value of $15,000, and that despite
the
clear intention of the plaintiff not to place any orders for the purchase of
worms, up to and including 10 June 1999, and despite
the clear fact, fully
conceded by Mr Murray in the witness box today, that the plaintiff was not in a
position to purchase any worms
up to that date, no breach of the agreement had
occurred.
<P>

15   	The construction of the agreement that the plaintiff
submits should be adopted by the Court is a construction which in effect
places
an obligation upon the grower to have ready each month and to offer for
purchase by the company a minimum quantity of $600
worth of worms, but does not
place upon the company any obligation either to purchase those, or any, worms
until the termination
of the first term of the agreement (which is 12 months
from the commencement date). That is, on the construction submitted by the
plaintiff, there is no default by the plaintiff unless within 12 months of a
date which the plaintiff itself led the defendant to
believe would be the date
of the first order for worms (that is, 18 April 1998), the plaintiff did not
purchase $15,000 worth of
worms. Upon such a construction the plaintiff would
not be in default of the agreement if, on 18 April 1999 --- that is a month
from
now --- it purchased $15,000 worth of worms from the defendant.
<P>

16   	In an application of the nature of that before the Court
for the setting aside of the statutory demand, the Court must consider
whether
there is a genuine dispute between the plaintiff company and the defendant
about the existence or  the amount of the debt.
 In the instant case the
plaintiff company says that there is a genuine dispute as to the existence of
the debt, in that there was
no default by the company under the terms of the
agreement; therefore, the defendant was not entitled to give the notice of 10
June
1998, and in consequence the plaintiff is not under an obligation to repay
the amounts totalling $5,000 which have been paid by the
defendant to the
plaintiff.
<P>

17   	It has been submitted, on behalf of the defendant, that
the construction placed upon the literal terms of the agreement do
not reflect
the business arrangement that existed between the two parties to the agreement,
and that there was an implied obligation
upon the plaintiff firstly to place
orders for worms, at least before the expiry of the 12 months, being the first
term of the agreement;
and then to accept any worms provided to it after an
order had been placed. It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff and
the
defendant both contemplated that there should in fact be orders placed by the
plaintiff at least before 18 April 1999. The entirety
of the conversations
between Mr Murphy and Mr Fletcher makes that manifestly clear.
<P>

18   	The evidence reveals that the plaintiff did not have the
facility to accept any worms that might have been provided for it
by the
defendant in accordance with the obligation placed upon the defendant under
clause 9 (3)  for the provision and supply of
regular monthly deliveries of
worms.
<P>

19   	The plaintiff cannot derive any comfort from the
suggestion that the defendant was now in breach of its obligation under clause
9.3 of the agreement. The plaintiff clearly did not want the worms to be
delivered to it on a monthly basis. It had no facilities
for them. In the
various conversations it was indicated to Mr Fletcher that the plaintiff was
not in a position to take any supplies
throughout the months of March, April
and May of 1998.
<P>

20   	The principles relating to the addition of terms to a
written document have been referred to in many decided cases. The <i>locus
classicus </i>is the judgment of the Bowen LJ in <i>The Moorcock </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20PD%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 14
PD 64</a> at 68.  As recently as 1977, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
in <i>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd  v  Shire of Hastings </i>(1977) 180
CLR 266 at 283 reaffirms the principle set forth in the judgment of Bowen LJ.
The Judicial Committee also quoted with approval
passages from the judgment of
Scrutton LJ in the English Court of Appeal in <i>Reigate  v  Union
Manufacturing Company</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1918%5d%201%20KB%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1918] 1 KB 592</a> at 605 and of Mackinnon LJ in
<i>Shirlaw  v  Southern Foundries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%202%20KB%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 2 KB 206</a> at 227.
<P>

21   	I have no doubt whatsoever that the parties in the instant
case contemplated that the plaintiff would place with the defendant
orders for
the delivery of worms long before the end of the first term of the contract.
Further, that the only reason why the plaintiff
did not abide by the terms of
what it clearly understood to be its obligation was its own inability to accept
the supply of worms
which the defendant was obliged to provide.
<P>

22   	In order to give business efficacy to the arrangement
between the parties there must essentially be implied a term which would
allow
the defendant to give the notice which he gave on 10 June 1998. That notice
having not  been complied with, I consider that
the plaintiff is in default and
that the provisions of clause 11 have been called into operation, and thus that
the plaintiff is
under an obligation to repay to the defendant the total amount
of $5,000 sought in the Statutory Demand.  There is no entitlement
in the
defendant to any interest on that amount, and I propose to make an order
varying the amount from the amount claimed in the
Demand to $5,000.
<P>

23   	I make the following orders: 
<P>

(1)	I order that the Summons be dismissed. 
<P>

(2)	I order that the Statutory Demand served by the defendant upon the
plaintiff dated 13 October 1998 be varied by reducing the
amount of the debt
referred to therein to $5,000.  
<P>

(3) 	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.
