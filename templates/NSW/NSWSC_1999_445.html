<P>

<b> COLIN ARTHUR SAGGERS &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	This judgment relates to the question of costs which remained reserved
following the judgments of His Honour Acting Justice Donovan
of 24 April and 29
April 1998 in defamation proceedings brought by Vernon Charles Howlett and
Daphne Pearson against Colin Arthur
Saggers and Keith Raymond Jones.
<P>

2	The substantive proceedings had been heard by his Honour with, as to the two
questions of whether the imputations pleaded arose
and whether they were
defamatory, a jury.  Publication had been admitted.
<P>

3	His Honour recorded the result of the jury's deliberations in his judgment of
24 April 1998 at p.4 as follows:-
<P>

	"The jury found that the first imputation arose and that it was defamatory.
They found the second imputation arose but was not
defamatory.  They found the
third imputation, that is the one concerning Mrs. Pearson, did not arise.  This
meant that after the
jury returned their answers, the trial proceeded pursuant
to s.7A before me only in relation to the first imputation and the first
plaintiff.  I record now that there will be a verdict for the defendants in
relation to the claim by the second plaintiff."
<P>

4	His Honour, in accordance with that then newly inserted provision of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.7A)</a>, heard the balance of the proceedings.  In the
result, after about two weeks of evidence and later, two days of submissions,
his
Honour found a verdict for the first plaintiff jointly against both
defendants in the sum of $13,500 and a verdict for the defendants
against the
second plaintiff, reserving costs.
<P>

5	Prior to his Honour hearing and deciding the question of costs, application
was made that he disqualify himself from hearing that
question.  After some
quite complex manoeuvring, his Honour held that neither actual nor ostensible
bias existed, and declined to
disqualify himself.  However, in the upshot, both
parties objected to his further proceeding with the matter of costs, and for
that
reason, he acceded to those submissions and recused himself.  He set out
the circumstances in his judgment of 24 April.
<P>

6	Notwithstanding this contretemps was caused by the plaintiffs' solicitors
apparently attempting to deliver a brief to his Honour
in anticipation of his
return to the bar and the then foreshadowing of the application, made before
me, that the plaintiffs' solicitors
should pay the costs thrown away by reason
of that decision, since the defendants lost on the basis they put for his
Honour stepping
down, it is clear that his Honour held that the solicitors'
actions were not causative of the result.  His Honour said he only took
the
course he did at the instance of both parties, thus neither party was
particularly responsible.  His Honour evidently saw no
basis for the
application of s.76C of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> nor for any exercise, to similar
effect, of  inherent or common law power or any power under s.76 or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> of
the Rules.  Neither do I.
<P>

7	In consequence of his Honour's recusancy, the matter was re-listed, before
me, on 28 October 1998.  Acutely aware of the parties'
sensibilities from the
history of the matter, I raised the fact that when I was at the bar prior to my
appointment, I had acted for
one of the parties and had done so in
circumstances where I had been made aware of, at least, to a limited extent,
matters which
may have underlain one or more of the imputations.
Notwithstanding this, all the parties sought that I deal with the costs
question.
 I recorded in a short note on that day the parties' consent to my
determining the matter.
<P>

8	In these unusual circumstances, I determined I should proceed, accepting that
it was clear that I had power to, and indeed should,
determine the question of
costs by exercising such discretions as would necessarily be exercised, for
myself, without having had
the advantage of being the trial judge.
Nonetheless, in doing so, I considered it would be necessary for me to have
regard to the
verdicts, judgments and findings of the trial judge and the views
expressed by him, since the parties are at issue, except in respect
of the
asserted necessity for and acceptance of an order for the general costs of her
action against Mrs. Pearson, as to the events
of the trial and particularly
their significance for costs, as to the appropriate principles and rules of
court and have expatiated
upon their differences in their submissions.
<P>

9	Oral hearings occurred on 28 October 1998 and on 17 February 1999.
Thereafter, eschewing any further oral hearing, the parties
exchanged and
provided to me written submissions until I put a stop to the process.  I had
the parties advised that in the absence
of anything further, at the close of 14
days, I would proceed to judgment, and I now do so.
<P>

10	It is regrettable that the climate and detail of argument in this matter,
even in the written submissions, has developed to the
point where undignified
and ascerbic aspersions are cast by counsel on each other and their respective
competencies.  The transcript
reveals the development of these attitudes during
the case.  This culture has infected the proceedings and prolonged them well
beyond
what the issues deserved.  Regrettably, his Honour's stepping down means
that another judge, unfamiliar with the events and the proceedings,
must
attempt, from the transcript and written submissions, which are affected by
those attitudes, to distil the critical matter on
which to found a
dispassionate determination.
<P>

11	The legal practitioners have each attributed to the other the responsibility
for various of the events of the trial and the submissions
have descended, in
support of contentions as to which party should have the costs advantage of
success on particular issues, to the
attempted allocation of blame as to such
matters as:  those giving rise to Donovan, AJ.'s stepping down;  counsels'
comments to the
jury;  and the resulting extended discharge application (see
judgment of 6 March 1998);  counsels' mode of cross-examination and
mode of
address leading to an application to re-open (judgments of 10 March 1998 and 25
March 1998);  and the late filing and amendment
of defences (as to this last,
Donovan, AJ. expressly reserved the costs).
<P>

12	It is the applicability of the appropriate rule of court and the principles
underlying it for the exercise of the discretion
in awarding costs and the
question of whether the costs occasioned on the determination of particular
issues should be offset or
awarded that have been the principal focus of the
disputes before me.
<P>

13	Section 76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> and Parts 52 and 52A of the Supreme
Court Rules deal generally with costs.  The proceedings having commenced after
1 July 1994, Part
52A would, in the absence of my otherwise ordering under Part
52 Rule 1, be the appropriate Part.  I see no basis to "otherwise order".
<P>

14	Section 76(1)(a) and (b) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> provide as follows:-
<P>

	"(1)	Subject  to this Act and the rules and subject to any other Act:-
<P>

	(a)	costs shall be in the discretion of the court;
<P>

	(b)	the court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent
costs are to be paid; ..."
<P>

15	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> regulates the exercise of that discretion and provides the
particular exemplification of the principles that enable the discretion
to be
exercised judicially.
<P>

16	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a>, Rule 4(1) provides for the powers and discretions of the court
under s.76 to be exercised subject to and in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A.</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 11</a>
provides:-
<P>

	"If the court makes any order as to costs, the court shall, subject to this
Part, order that the costs follow the event, except
where it appears to the
court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the
costs."
<P>

17	That Rule reflects the general position at common law that the successful
party should have the costs of obtaining vindication.
<P>

18	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33</a> reads:-
<P>

	"...
<P>

	(1)	This rule:-
<P>

	(a)	applies to proceedings in the Common Law Division or entered into the
Commercial List on a claim for debt, damages or other
money;
<P>

	...
<P>

	(2)	Where:-
<P>

	...
<P>

	(e)	in proceedings commenced after 30 June 1993, but on or before 1 October
1997, a plaintiff recovers a sum not more than $75,000;
<P>

	...
<P>

	the plaintiff shall not be entitled to payment of his or her costs of the
proceedings unless, it appearing to the court that the
plaintiff had sufficient
reason for commencing or continuing proceedings in the court, the court makes
an order for payment."
<P>

19	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33(3)</a> provides:-
<P>

	"Without limiting the generality of subrule (2), it shall be taken to be a
sufficient reason if the plaintiff had reasonable grounds
at the relevant time
for expecting that he would recover an amount in excess of the amount
prescribed by that subrule."
<P>

20	Rules 33(4) and (5) provide:-
<P>

	"Subject to subrule (5) where, by or under the rules or any order of the
court, the plaintiff is entitled to his or her costs of
any proceedings to
which this rule applies, the amount of costs payable to him or her shall:-
<P>

	...
<P>

	(e)	in respect of proceedings commenced after 30 June 1993, but on or before 1
October 1997, where he or she recovers a sum more
than $75,000 but not more
than $150,000, be only a half of the whole amount;
<P>

	...
<P>

	(5)	In a case to which subrule (5) applies, if it appears to the court that
the plaintiff had sufficient reason for commencing
or continuing proceedings in
the court, the court may order that the amount of costs payable to the
plaintiff be some greater part
or the whole of the amount which would be
payable to him or her apart from that subrule."
<P>

21	Subrule (7) provides that where under the Rules or any order, costs are
payable to the plaintiff and the proceedings had commenced
at the time at which
these did, and had resulted in a recovery by the plaintiff of less than
$150,000, the costs of more than one
counsel shall not be allowed unless
otherwise ordered.
<P>

22	The action, the first or one of the first under the new provisions of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> also, unsurprisingly, was beset by questions of admissibility
under the then, recent <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  The hearing of the action was prolonged
and bitterly fought, notwithstanding that the defamation found by the jury was
held by
his Honour to be of a private nature of limited circulation, of
transient significance for the plaintiffs' reputation, not a serious
defamation
with significant but not substantial aggravation.  There was no claim for
special damage nor for general loss nor loss
of business and not only no
apology but confirmation in a subsequent publication.  His Honour noted that
there were special circumstances
which considerably confirmed the damage.
<P>

23	I have referred to publication having been admitted and the jury
determinations.  The trial judge had held that all the imputations
pleaded were
capable of arising and of being defamatory.  Counsel for the defendants did not
submit otherwise.  The real issues were
as to the defences (particularly the
"innocent distributor defence") and damages.  The main time consuming questions
appeared to
relate to the events I have above referred to, the innocent
distributor defence and defence contentions, to some extent successful,
particularly in the context of the new s.46A, to some extent artificial,
seeking to limit damages so that the figure awarded would
be much lower than
that which might otherwise be expected.  Whilst the action had been commenced
after the amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> had come into effect, the full
impact of them, even though they were designed to diminish general damages in
defamation, was still
to be ascertained.
<P>

24	The action could have been brought in the District Court.  It might have
been transferred to the District Court.  The novelty
and complexity of the
legal issues might have mitigated against such a course.  But since it was
brought and maintained in this court
and the verdict was below $75,000, the
defendant submits that, by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33(2)</a> the plaintiff should
be deprived of his costs.  The plaintiff claims that because of the reasonable
expectation of a sufficient verdict
and for other reasons he should have his
costs.
<P>

25	I do not consider the plaintiff has established such reasonable grounds as
are referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33(3)</a> in the light of the trial judge's findings.
Prima facie these defamations as alleged and particularised were unlikely to
require
an award fairly proportionate to their injury so large as would be
necessary to satisfy the Rule.  No unforeseeable event occurred
to diminish
what otherwise might have been the reasonably expected level of damages.  The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> amendments occurred nine months before filing of the statement
of claim. It was notorious they were expected to lower damages awards.
 I turn
to whether there is any other basis on which the prima facie effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33</a>
might be displaced.
<P>

26	His Honour noted that this "may also be one of the few cases of this type to
be heard in the Supreme Court in view of the potential
limitations under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.46A</a>
and the increased jurisdiction of the District Court to $750,000" (judgment of
24 April 1998, at p.67).  At various points his Honour
notes the novelty and
complexity of the legal propositions he had to consider and published a number
of judgments, that of 24 April
being most extensive.
<P>

27	His Honour had reserved the costs of the amendment application.  He refers
specifically to costs but only in general terms, in
the context of his
declining to decide the question of costs at p.3 of his judgment of 29 April
1998 as follows:-
<P>

	"It is possible that the costs decision in this matter may not be an easy
decision.  There are provisions in the rules for reduced
costs to a plaintiff
where a verdict is below a certain amount but, of course, other factors such as
the complexity of the case may
lead to either a full costs order or something
more than the order in the rules.  Some cases of a similar type but until the
pre-1994
amendments as this case have led to special or reduced costs orders
(see, for example, <b>Toomey v. John Fairfax &amp; Sons</b> (Hunt, J.,
unreported 22 May 1995, noted in Ritchie's Supreme Court Practice at
para.13035)."
<P>

28	He had earlier, in his judgment on 24 April 1998 (at pp.51-52), said:-
<P>

	"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 7A</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s46a.html" class="autolink_findacts">46A</a> introduce the new approaches to defamation law.  In most
areas of our tort law the general duty of care has become the yardstick
for
civil liability.  Such a general duty may find its way into the ancient rules
of libel and slander as we approach the next millennium,
but not in this
decision.
<P>

	Although this it (sic) is not part of my function in this trial to consider
the balance in determining the appropriate damages
it has seemed to me that the
law as it stands is not adequately equipped to deal with the type of defamation
which has taken 12 days
of hearing time in this Supreme Court.  The financial
effect on one or other (and perhaps both) parties will be utterly catastrophic.
The costs will be overwhelming.  No litigant (be they plaintiff or defendant)
should be exposed to such costs in a matter of this
type.  Mr. Howlett is of
course entitled to have his reputation vindicated.  It should not be through a
duel and nor should it be
through someone's financial ruin.  Even though there
are costs rules in the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 24</a>, which may be applied in
some circumstances to relieve a defendant's costs burden, it still means the
plaintiff is left with the
costs burden and even if the whole of these
proceedings had been heard in the District Court, while there would have been
some costs
savings, the totality of the costs would still have been
overwhelming for private individuals.  This raises a question whether the
time
has come for a re-examination of the whole law of defamation which might be
subject to that general duty of care propounded
by Lord Atkin in <b>Donoghue v.
Stevenson</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 100</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC 562</a>, which little by little in increments, has been
established as an overriding duty to be applied in most tortious circumstances.
This
is not the place to reflect further on that question."
<P>

29	While one can appreciate these sentiments, they are of little assistance in
the task I must perform.
<P>

30	Alternatively, to their primary submissions both parties have sought costs
be resolved issue by issue.  Although both parties
have contributed to the
prolongation of the present proceedings, it does not seem to me that in any
particular respect the conduct
of either has been such, on balance and overall,
as to require dissection of the dispute instead of dealing with the matter more
generally.  
<P>

31	Thus, as and between the successful plaintiff and the defendants,
notwithstanding the multiple issues to which the parties refer
in their
submissions, I consider that this is not a matter where it is appropriate to
seek to balance and offset success or failure
on particular forensic issues or
to turn to some elaborate time costing, in the light of the conduct of the
matter by the parties
and their legal representatives, to which I have referred
above.
<P>

32	In particular, as the matter went to trial on the three imputations,
notwithstanding that they constitute under the Act separate
causes of action,
and the defendants succeeded as against one plaintiff on one imputation and as
against the other on one imputation,
I would not be minded to consider that,
thereby, there should be some offsetting of success on one imputation against
failure on
another.  I am concerned with the costs of the proceedings not as to
individual causes of action in the proceedings where the evidence
and argument
are anything but compartmentalised.  Particularly is this so, since part of the
successful imputation upon which Mr.
Howlett sued reflected the unsuccessful
imputation and this gave rise to an entirely artificial argument which occupied
much time
concerning damages.  Similarly, I am not minded, considering the
foreshadowing of the defences, to make any special order by way
of costs or in
recognition of some offset principle for the amended defences, or, bearing in
mind the way both parties conducted
the proceedings, the discharge application,
one way or the other, notwithstanding which party enjoyed the eventual success
on such
matter.
<P>

33	Appreciating, as I do, that the general approach would be to award the
costs, at least as to the general costs of the action,
to the successful party,
taking the view I do I consider that no costs should be awarded against Mrs.
Pearson, in particular, following
the rejection of the imputation upon which
she sued by the jury except as are involved in the formal entry of judgment
consequent
thereon.
<P>

34	I now turn to whether under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33</a> the successful plaintiff should have his
costs and if so, to what extent.
<P>

35	The purpose of the applicable Rules is to encourage litigants to commence or
maintain their proceedings in the court which has
an appropriate extent of
jurisdiction such as to ensure that the cases which remain in this court are of
appropriate importance,
complexity or nature suitable to be decided in this
court rather than the District Court.  The rules seek to achieve this result
by
requiring the satisfaction of the flexible but objective criteria posed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part
52A</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 33(2)</a> before costs are ordered even for a successful party and by
diminishing those costs unless otherwise ordered proportionately to the
range
in which the verdict is placed.
<P>

36	Where the issues are legally complex and novel, where because of that, the
argument is sophisticated and vigorous and the resolution
of the issues likely
to produce valuable procedural or substantive precedents, a matter might be
maintained in this court and consistently
with authority, costs might be
awarded in the sound exercise of discretion, giving full regard to what was
said in <b>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited v. Palmer</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 297</a> and
<b>Toomey v. John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited</b> (Hunt, CJ. at CL., unreported
22 May 1995) and in the cases cited therein.  Notwithstanding the changes in
the Rules, the principles
applicable to the making of exceptional orders,
remain of great importance.
<P>

37	Here, the defence vigorously fought all issues and required the exploration
of novel, complex and sophisticated concepts to dispose
of the matters raised,
as his Honour's judgments show.  It hardly lies in the defence mouth to submit
as it has that it was a simple
case.  The otherwise limited factual ambit and
importance of the case as shown by the evidence and verdicts do not reflect the
matters
of great difficulty and legal importance which, by reason of the way
the parties fought the case had to be resolved.  There were
decisions on the
application of new procedures, new legislation and new damages concepts and
which were assisted by extensive argument
resulting in detailed judgments on
matters of important principle for future litigation in defamation in this  and
other courts.
<P>

38	In my view, this was an appropriate matter to be maintained in the Supreme
Court once the application to amend and the necessity
to explore new procedures
to accommodate the new legislation arose.  The damages issues followed as a
consequence.
<P>

39	The very level of debate persuades me that this is also a matter in which
the plaintiff should have his full costs of the action
until verdict and
judgment.  Thereafter, since what occurred was on the application of both
parties, the costs of his Honour's stepping
down and of the costs argument
before me should not fall otherwise than on the parties incurring them.
<P>

40	I order that the second plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of her action
limited as I have said and that the defendants pay
the first plaintiff's costs
of his action up to Donovan, AJ. retiring from the matter.  Thereafter each
party is to pay their own
costs.
