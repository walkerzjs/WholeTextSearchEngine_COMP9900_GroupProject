EQUITY DIVISION

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Tuesday, 2 February 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2638 of 1997	FLETT   -v-   BROUGH</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> Concerning the matter of costs, I consider that the costs to
which the plaintiff should be entitled would be the general costs of
the
proceedings discounted by a proportion reflecting the purported application of
the plaintiff under the <i>Child Support Assessment Act</i>, 1989.
<P>

2	In a judgment delivered by me on the first day of the hearing, 19 August
1998, I ultimately held that that purported application
made by the plaintiff
on 11 August 1998 was not an application and was not properly before the Court.
It was not subject to and could
not be subject to any orders and directions.
Accordingly it was not then and is not now open to me to make any order for
costs in
favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff in respect to that
purported application.  Nevertheless, several hours of the first
day of the
hearing were taken up with legal argument concerning whether that application
was properly before the Court.
<P>

3	However until I delivered my judgment at the conclusion of the submissions
concerning that purported application it was necessary
for the defendant in its
preparation of the present proceedings to be alert to the fact that the
plaintiff was purporting to make
such an application and to be prepared to
resist such an application. Since the plaintiff was substantially successful in
her claim
under the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>, had the proceedings
consisted only of that claim, she would have been entitled to the entirety of
the costs. Nevertheless, on account
of the purported application to which I
have referred, the costs of the plaintiff should in my view be discounted.
<P>

4	I have reached the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to receive from
the defendant three-quarters of her costs of the
proceedings.  Accordingly I
have emended order 7 in the short minutes of orders which have been prepared by
the plaintiff now to
read as follows:
<P>

5	That the defendant pay three-quarters of the plaintiff's costs of and
incidental to these proceedings in a sum to be agreed between
the parties or,
failing agreement, as assessed.
<P>

6	I make the following orders:
<P>

1. 	I make orders as in paragraphs 1 to 7 in the short minutes of order
initialled by me and filed in Court this day.
<P>

2. 	I note paragraph 8 in the short minutes.
<P>

<i>I certify that this and the preceding</i>
<P>

<i>pages are a true copy of the reasons for</i>
<P>

<i>judgment of Master McLaughlin</i>
<P>

<i>Dated:</i>	2 February 1999
