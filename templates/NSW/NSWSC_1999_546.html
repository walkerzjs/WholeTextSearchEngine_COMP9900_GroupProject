<P>

<center> <u>JUDGMENT</u></center>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:   These proceedings seek judicial review of an order of the
Consumer Claims Tribunal (NSW) made on 28 May 1998 under
section 30 of the
Consumer Claims Tribunal Act 1987 (NSW) ("the Act") that the plaintiff, Mr
Samir Batshon, and a Mr Johnson, pay
the sum of $20,175 to Mr and Mrs Elias,
the first and second defendants.
<P>

	Section 12 of the Act permits judicial review proceedings to be brought in
relation to such an order to be brought on the ground
that the Tribunal had no
jurisdiction to make the order, or that in relation to the hearing or
determination a party to the claim
was denied natural justice. The ground now
relied upon in these proceedings is that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to
make the
order, other grounds not having not been pursued. 
<P>

	Under s 10(1) of the Act, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine
consumer claims which are defined in section 3 to
include claims by a consumer
for the payment of a specified sum of money. Section 12A defines a building
claim to include inter alia:

<P>

"<i>(a) the payment of a specified sum of money, or</i>
<P>

<i>.....</i>
<P>

<i>(c) relief from payment of a specified sum of money,</i>
<P>

<i>.....</i>
<P>

<i>that arises from a supply of building goods or services, whether under a
contract or not, or that arises under a contract that is
collateral to a
contract for the supply of building goods or services.</i>"
<P>

The term "building goods and services" is also defined and includes goods or
services supplied for or in connection with the carrying
out of residential
building work. Section 12B provides inter alia that a building claim is to be
considered to be a consumer claim.
Section 32 of the Act imposes a limitation
upon the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and provides inter alia:
<P>

"<i>(1) A tribunal has no jurisdiction to make in respect of a particular
consumer claim an order or orders in favour of the claimant
or, where there are
2 or more claimant, in favour of those claimants if the total of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the amount or amounts (if any) of money to be paid,</i>
<P>

<i>.....</i>
<P>

<i>under or by virtue of the order or orders would exceed the prescribed
amount.</i>"
<P>

The amount prescribed for the purposes of s 32 by  the Consumer Claims Tribunal
Regulations is specified in reg 6(1) as $25,000.
  
<P>

	Wide and general words are used in the definition of "consumer claim" and of
"building claim". It is therefore not surprising that
the words "a specific sum
of money" which appear in those definitions have been given a wide reading. In
<i>WD &amp; HO Wills Australia Limited v Consumer Claims Tribunal (NSW) &amp;
Anor</i> (unreported, Court of Appeal, 23 July 1998), the term was held to
encompass a claim for a specified, that is, nominated sum, notwithstanding
that
the amount was claimed by way of unliquidated damages. Similarly in<b>
</b><i>Hales v Consumer Claims</i><b> </b><i>Tribunal &amp; Anor</i><b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20ASC%2055%2d985" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) ASC 55-985</a> and in <i>Sandford v Marjen Building Contractors Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20ASC%2056%2d148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) ASC 56-148</a> the term was held to encompass a net sum due after
taking into account items on both sides of the ledger.
<P>

	It matters not that the quantum of the various issues to be considered exceeds
the jurisdictional limit of the Tribunal, $25,000,
provided that the sum that
is sought in the claim is within the jurisdictional limit. This was made clear
by Allen J in <i>Hales</i> when his Honour said at 58,855:
<P>

<i> "It is apparent, therefore, that the jurisdiction is related to the nature
of the relief sought by the consumer rather than the cause
of action upon which
that claim was founded."</i>
<P>

 	In<b> </b><i>Sandford</i> Grove J said at page 57,451:
<P>

<i>  "The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is, as the provisions I have set out
show, limited by the order it can make not by the value of
the ingredients of
the dispute from which proceedings originated."</i>
<P>

 	It follows that a claim must specify a sum which is within the jurisdictional
limit of the Tribunal;  but it matters not that
the value of the elements
making up the claim may exceed the jurisdictional limit of $25,000, if that sum
is within the jurisdictional
limit. As Stein JA, with whom Mason P and Meagher
JA agreed, in <i>Wills</i> said at page 8:
<P>

<i> "It [the claim] has to be for the payment of a specified sum of money. The
requirement is satisfied if a sum of money is specified
in the claim and is
within the jurisdictional limit of the Tribunal."</i>
<P>

 	In<b> </b><i>Archom Ltd v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Ors</i><b>,
</b>(unreported, Administrative Law Division, 29/9/95) Simpson J made the same
point when her Honour said at page 16:
<P>

<i> "Whether jurisdiction exists must be determined by reference to the 'claim'
made by the claimant....'Claim' is to be equated with
what is asserted by the
claimant; that is what the claimant, rightly or wrongly asserts. Jurisdiction
depends upon the correct analysis
of the assertion made by the claimant in the
claim form."</i>
<P>

Provided that a claim asserts on its face a building claim as defined, and
provided that the sum specified in the claim is within
the jurisdictional
limit,  the Tribunal will have jurisdiction. 
<P>

	In the present case, the plaintiff and Mr Johnson had entered into a contract
to undertake residential building works for the defendants,
Mr and Mrs Elias.
Disputes arose towards the end of the construction.  The plaintiff and Mr
Johnson ultimately lodged with the Tribunal
a claim for the balance of monies
alleged to be due under the building contract. For reasons which I need not
mention, that claim
was withdrawn.
<P>

	On the advice of the referee dealing with that first claim, Mr and Mrs Elias,
on 21 November 1997, lodged their own claim with
the Tribunal. On its face the
claim lodged was a building claim as defined. The claim specified "cost of
incompleted works including
major defects caused by unqualified tradesmen and
lack of proper supervision of the respondent". The claim sought a money order
for
$25,000.  As the claim expressed itself to be a cross-claim requested by
the referee, and as it referred to the claim lodged by the
plaintiff and Mr
Johnson, it could be inferred that items on both sides of the ledger would have
to be taken into account in the
determination of the claim.
<P>

	The hearing before the Tribunal proceeded on that footing.  Ultimately an
order was made on 28 May 1998 that the plaintiff and
Mr Johnson pay $23,175 to
Mr and Mrs Elias on or before 28 July 1998. The reasons for the decision show
that the referee took into
account both monies agreed to be paid by Mr and Mrs
Elias under the building contract and sums held to be due to Mr and Mrs Elias
for poor and defective work performed and like matters. Subsequently on 10 July
1998 at the request of the plaintiff under s 33 of
the Act, the order was
reduced to $20,175 to take account of certain variations to the works which the
referee had failed to take
into account. 
<P>

	It is not in dispute that were those the only relevant facts the Tribunal
would have had jurisdiction to make its order that the
plaintiff and Mr Johnson
pay the sum of $20,175 to Mr and Mrs Elias.
<P>

	The challenge to the jurisdiction has arisen from a circumstance which
occurred at the first hearing of the claim on 28 January
1998. At that hearing,
Mr and Mrs Elias tendered a statutory declaration by an independent expert Mr T
W Dessaix, which specified
items for defective and incomplete work and like
matters totalling $40,518.75.
<P>

	Handwritten notes of the referee made on that day record: 
<P>

<i>"Explained to C [claimant] - jurisdiction restricted...to  $25,000 ... C
decided to amend claim to full damage alleged &amp; submit
to $25,000
jurisdiction."</i>
<P>

	The referee made a formal order for amendment. The typed order as issued,
reads: 
<P>

<i>"The Tribunal allows the claimants to amend their claim as follows:  Money
order sought $45,000.75 being $40,518.75 for defective
building and unfinished
work; $750.00 for damage to washing machine and $3,739 for damage to carpet."
</i>
<P>

	The plaintiff has given oral evidence in these  proceedings that at that
conference it was stated clearly that the Tribunal could
only award $25,000 but
would hear the claim for $45,007.75. In the course of the hearing on that day
the claim form lodged with the
Tribunal was amended by crossing out the $25,000
specified as the sum for which a money order was sought and by substituting for
that sum the sum of $45,007.75. The signatures of the plaintiff and Mr Elias
appear next to the amendment. 
<P>

	The plaintiff's counsel Mr D Re has submitted that the claim was transformed
by this amendment into a claim for $45,007.75, and
that once that had occurred,
the Tribunal no longer had jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Counsel for
the defendant, Mrs M Gilmour,
has submitted, however, that it was always clear
that the money order sought by Mr and Mrs Elias was limited to $25,000.  
<P>

	Although in form Mr and Mrs Elias appeared to make a claim for $45,007.75, I
am satisfied that is not the substance of what occurred.
It is plain from the
referee's notes, and from the evidence given by the plaintiff, that Mr and Mrs
Elias at all times restricted
the monetary sum for which an order was sought to
$25,000. Indeed, the referee did not have power to allow Mr and Mrs Elias to
amend
their claim so as to claim any sum in excess of $25,000, as the referee
well knew.
<P>

	All that occurred, in substance, was that the expert's report was treated as
setting out particulars of the items which Mr and
Mrs Elias claimed as falling
on their side of the ledger. Notwithstanding that the sum specified in the
formal claim form was amended,
Mr and Mrs Elias made it plain to the plaintiff
and to the referee that they submitted to the $25,000 jurisdictional limit,
that
is to say that the money that order they sought was that sum of $25,000.
In my opinion, the substance of the claim was not altered
by the inelegantly
expressed order of the referee. All the parties and the referee were aware that
the claim for a money order was
limited to $25,000.
<P>

	In these circumstances, the Tribunal did not lack jurisdiction to hear and
determine the claim and to make the order which it did
on 28 May 1998 and on 10
July 1998. For these reasons, the application to the Court must be dismissed
with costs.
