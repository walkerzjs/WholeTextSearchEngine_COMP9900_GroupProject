<b><u>30073/98 - State Transit Authority v Peter Eric Sloey &amp;
Anor</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>HEADNOTE</u></b>
<P>

	An employee bus driver was diagnosed as suffering from blockage of a coronary
artery and underwent coronary artery graft surgery.
 Although he was
symptom-free the employer did not have him medically examined but certified him
unfit to return to his former job.
 It offered him, and he accepted, a lesser
job at lower pay.  The employer justified its action in purported reliance on
the terms
of a set of guidelines or standards issued by the National Road
Transport Commission and the Federal Office of Road Safety, asserting
that all
employees who had undergone coronary artery graft surgery presented an
increased risk of symptoms for a further twelve months
after surgery.  The
employer was obliged under ss 15, 16 Occupational Health and Safety Act to
ensure the health, safety and welfare
of its employees, to maintain safe plant
and systems of work and working environment and to ensure that persons not in
the employer's
employment were not exposed to risks to their health or safety
arising from the conduct of the employer's undertaking while they
were at the
employer's place of work.  The employer asserted that in order to meet its
obligation under the Occupational Health and
Safety Act it was necessary for it
to apply the guidelines or standards, treating the employee as a member of a
category of persons
presenting an increased risk of symptoms and without
reference to his individual medical condition, and certify him unfit to drive
a
bus.
<P>

	The Equal Opportunity Tribunal found that the employer had discriminated
against the employee in his work on the ground of disability
in that it
discriminated against him on the ground of a characteristic that appertains
generally to persons who have that disability.
 The Tribunal concluded that it
was a characteristic that appertained generally to persons suffering from
blockage of a coronary
artery that they often undergo coronary artery graft
surgery.  The Tribunal held that the employer was not entitled to certify the
driver unfit to drive merely because he fell into a category of persons who
presented an increased risk of symptoms, but was obliged
to consider his
individual circumstances.  Accordingly the Tribunal found for the employee and
made an award of damages.
<P>

	The employer appealed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.  It argued
first that the Tribunal was wrong in concluding that
it may be a characteristic
which appertains generally to persons suffering from blockage of a coronary
artery that they often undergo
coronary artery graft surgery and, even if it
may be, that the Tribunal was not entitled without evidence to conclude that it
is
a characteristic of such persons that they often undergo such surgery.
Secondly, it submitted that the Tribunal erred in concluding
that there was no
defence of necessity.
<P>

	It was held that on the ordinary meaning of the word "characteristic" the
Tribunal was entitled to hold that it may be a characteristic
of persons
suffering from such a disability that they often undergo such surgery, and that
the Tribunal was entitled to find, without
evidence, that it is a
characteristic of persons suffering from such a disability that they often
undergo such surgery, that being
a matter of common knowledge.
<P>

	It was further held that the Tribunal was correct in concluding that it was
not necessary in order for the employer to meet its
obligations under the
Occupational Health and Safety Act to certify the employee unfit to drive a bus
by treating him merely as a
member of a category of persons who presented an
increased risk of symptoms without having him medically examined and
considering
his individual state of health.

<b>Friday, 12 March 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>30073/98 - State Transit Authority v Peter Eric Sloey &amp;
Anor</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1<b>	HIS HONOUR:</b>  By its summons the plaintiff, State Transit Authority
("STA"), seeks orders setting aside and otherwise relating to a decision of
the
second defendant, the Equal Opportunity Tribunal of New South Wales ("the
Tribunal") in proceedings between the first defendant,
Peter Eric Sloey, and
STA.  The Tribunal submits to the orders of the Court other than any order for
costs.
<P>

2	Mr Sloey was a bus driver employed by STA.  Late in 1995 he was diagnosed as
suffering from angina and certified unfit for work.
 In January 1996 blockages
of a coronary artery were diagnosed.  There was no infarction.  On 29 January
1996 Dr Brady, a surgeon,
carried out coronary artery graft surgery.  Mr Sloey
had kept STA informed about what was happening, and on 22 February 1996 saw
Dr
Garvan as required by STA.  Dr Garvan is a consultant occupational physician.
He did not examine Mr Sloey but told him that he
would not be allowed to drive
a bus until 12 months after the operation.  Dr Garvan was relying on the
contents of a document dated
November 1994 entitled "Medical Examinations of
Commercial Vehicle Drivers", prepared for and apparently issued by the National
Road
Transport Commission and the Federal Office of Road Safety.  At the
subsequent hearing this document was variously referred to by
counsel as
"guidelines" and "standards".  I shall call it "the standards".
<P>

3	The standards is a lengthy document and it will be sufficient to extract a
few passages from it.  The foreword includes these
passages -
<P>

			... health standards for commercial vehicle drivers  are especially
important because the community expects drivers of public
passenger vehicles
... to meet higher standards that the general driving population.  At the same
time, any regime wherein a person's
right to drive may be denied or restricted
on health or any other grounds needs sensitive treatment.  Decisions must be
based on
the best available evidence.
<P>

		...
<P>

			The Standards have been prepared to assist medical practitioners throughout
the country in providing expert advice about a driver's
medical eligibility for
a Commercial Driver's Licence.
<P>

			Given the rapid advances in medical knowledge and technology, the Standards
will be reviewed in the future to ensure that they
incorporate any relevant
medical advances.
<P>

4	These passages are taken from the body of the document.  Under the heading
<b>Purpose of Standards</b> appears the following -
<P>

		These standards are intended to assist medical practitioners who are
conducting medical examinations of commercial drivers on
behalf of driver
licensing authorities.  The licensing authorities require clear, non-technical
medical advice regard a person's
fitness to drive commercial vehicles so as to
ensure public safety.  The final decision on certification rests with licensing
authorities.
<P>

5	Under the heading <b>Legal Disclaimer</b> appears the following -
<P>

			Whilst all reasonable care has been taken in compiling the standards and
criteria, the authors and the Australasian Faculty of
Occupational Medicine
accept no responsibility for any consequences arising from their
application.
<P>

			In addition, it is expected that doctors will keep themselves appraised of
major changes in medical knowledge which may influence
their assessment of
drivers.
<P>

6	Under the heading <b>Evaluation and Review</b> is stated -
<P>

			It is proposed to periodically revise these standards and procedures.
<P>

7	The greater part of the document goes under the general heading <b>Medical
Standards</b> and contains these passages -
<P>

			This part provides information on medical conditions which may affect
driving.  The criteria for assessment are set down, i.e.
whether applicants
meet the standards for a commercial vehicle driver's licence; whether a
conditional licence would be appropriate;
or whether further testing and
monitoring is required.
<P>

			...
<P>

			The important principle is that the evaluation of individual medical fitness
and safety to drive depends on comprehensive medical
assessment of overall
health and informed medical judgment about the impact of single or multiple
conditions on whole person function.
<P>

8	This appears under the sub-heading <b>Cardiovascular Conditions</b> -
<P>

		(c)	After confirmed myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting or
coronary angioplasty
<P>

		The criteria are NOT met:
<P>

		*	if the person has had confirmed myocardial infarction, coronary artery
bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty.  Efforts should
be directed at
retraining and redeployment of such drivers rather than adopting a `wait and
see' policy which depends on the individual
`passing' a future medical test.
<P>

		The person may be reviewed if no symptoms of coronary artery disease have
occurred for 12 months.
<P>

		The criteria are NOT met:
<P>

		*	in most circumstances where coronary artery disease has occurred.
<P>

		A conditional licence may be considered by an approved specialist:
<P>

		*	if a person has been asymptomatic for a minimum of 12 months, has good
control of risk factors and does not require medication
for control of
symptoms.  The results of both non-invasive tests and coronary angiography will
be required for review by an approved
specialist.  The specialist may suggest
re-licensing subject to period assessment (both non-invasive and invasive).
<P>

9	Annexed to the document is a model health assessment form, containing a
section for a medical practitioner to complete after examining
the driver the
subject of any inquiry.
<P>

10	On 22 February 1996 Dr Garvan wrote to Dr Brady asking for written
confirmation that Dr Brady had done the surgical operation.
 Dr Brady replied
in a letter dated 18 March 1996 and said -
<P>

		Thank you for your letter regarding Mr Peter Slowey (sic).  This gentleman
underwent coronary bypass surgery at North Shore Hospital
on the 29th January
1996.  At operation three grafts were performed.  Mr Slowey's postoperative
course was uncomplicated and at the
time of discharge he was being treated for
pre-existing hypertension with Metoprolol and Renitec.  He had been taking this
medication
for quite some time, the indication for this gentleman's surgery was
Class 3 angina, ventricular function was within normal limits.
<P>

		On review today Mr Slowey is in excellent condition following his surgery,
blood pressure was 150/80.  His pulse rate is 60 consistent
with beta blockade.
His wounds have healed satisfactorily and his chest is clear.  He has no
persistent symptoms of ischaemia and
he has a good exercise tolerance.
<P>

		With regard to his employment I could see no reason why this gentleman would
not be ready to return to full time work after three
months recuperation.  I
have asked Mr Slowey to make an appointment to return to see his Cardiologist,
Dr Wilkes, for review also.
<P>

11	Having received the confirmation, Dr Garvan did not examine Mr Sloey but
applied the statement in the standards that the criteria
were not met because
the first defendant had had coronary artery bypass grafting within the last 12
months.  He certified him unfit
to drive a bus.
<P>

12	On 25 March 1996 Dr Wilkes also certified him fit to return to work as a bus
driver on 1 May 1996.
<P>

13	Mr Sloey gave those certificates to STA's controlling officer at his work
depot.  He also informed the Department of Transport
and the Roads and Traffic
Authority about his operation and his certification of fitness to return to
work.  Neither of those bodies
took any action to restrict the terms of his
driving licence.
<P>

14	Mr Sloey returned to work on 1 May 1996 and on the following day saw Dr
Garvan a second time as required by STA.  As on the first
occasion, Dr Garvan
had with him the standards.  He told Mr Sloey that according to its contents he
would be unable to work as a
driver for 12 months.  He did not examine him.
<P>

15	Mr Sloey found himself obliged to accept the offer of a light duty position
as a bus cleaner at a lower rate of pay, and that
is the work that he did until
STA permitted him to drive a bus again in January 1997.  He complained to the
Anti-Discrimination Board
of New South Wales and the President of the Board
eventually referred the complaint to the Tribunal under the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 94</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act 1977</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>").
<P>

16	In order to succeed in his action Mr Sloey had to show that STA had
unlawfully discriminated against him in his work on the ground
of disability.
The relevant sections of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are as follows -
<P>

		<b>49D	Discrimination against ... employees</b>

... 
<P>

					...
<P>

				(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1) (a), something is done on the ground

<P>

(1)	In this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise
indicates or requires:

<P>

				...
<P>

17	The Tribunal heard evidence and argument on 2 December 1997 and reserved its
decision.  One of the three members of the Tribunal
unfortunately died and
there was a delay in the delivery of the judgment and reasons, which were given
in writing on 18 June 1998.
 The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> contains provision for the decision of the
Tribunal to be by majority, and no point is taken about those matters.
<P>

18	The Tribunal found that the first defendant had proved his case and made an
award of damages.
<P>

19	By s 118 an appeal lies to this Court on a question of law.  Subs (3)
requires the Court to hear and determine the question of
law arising on the
appeal and either to remit the decision of the Court to the Tribunal's
successor, the Administrative Decisions
Tribunal, or make such other order in
relation to the appeal as seems fit.
<P>

20	Before the Tribunal STA argued that Mr Sloey had no disability and that it
had not discriminated against him by reference to
persons appropriate for
comparison.  Those arguments were lost and may be taken no further.  However,
STA argued alternatively that
if it had discriminated against Mr Sloey it had
not done so on the ground of disability.  Counsel put the case to the Tribunal
in
the following way -
<P>

		What is pleaded to be a disability is single vessel coronary disease.  Now
whatever actions were taken about the complainant's
employment were not taken
on account of single vessel coronary disease.  It ... will become clear from
the evidence that the decision
that the complainant could not drive a STA bus
for 12 months after the graft surgery ... was ... based on the assessed
propensity
of the complainant to have a potentially disabling heart episode
within 12 months of that surgery.  It's the surgery that's the touchstone,
that's quite clear when one looks at the standards ...
<P>

		... the reason that the complainant was not permitted to drive a bus was that
the standards say that he's not to drive a bus within
12 months of having the
piece of surgery.  The surgery isn't ... pleaded as a disability ... The
linkage is between the surgery and
the decision not to permit him to drive.
That being so, the decision not to permit him to drive which is complained of
as discriminatory
didn't spring from what he's pleaded to be a disability
...
<P>

21	Counsel's reference to things pleaded or not pleaded was to Mr Sloey's
Points of Claim filed in the Tribunal.  Paragraphs 6,
28 and 29 of this
document show how Mr Sloey pleaded his case.  They are as follows -
<P>

		6.		On a date unknown to the Complainant the Respondent adopted as its policy
guidelines contained in the document "Medical Examinations
of Commercial
Vehicle Drivers" prepared for the National Road Transport Commission and the
Federal Office of Road Safety by the Australasian
Faculty of Occupational
Medicine dated November 1994 ("the guidelines").
<P>

		28.	By reason of the guidelines referred to in paragraph 6 of these Points of
Claim, the Respondent discriminated against the
Complainant on the basis of his
disability within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec 49B(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> by treating him less
than favourably than it would have treated a person without the disability in
the same circumstances or in circumstances
which were not materially
different.
<P>

		29.	The discriminatory treatment referred to above and further particularised
in the Statement of Complainant filed in these proceedings
is unlawful under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49d.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec 49D(2)(d)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> in that the Respondent discriminated against the
Complainant on the basis of his disability by subjecting him to a detriment,
that
is by refusing to all him to continue as a bus driver after he had been
certified fit to resume his normal bus driving duties without
carrying out a
medical assessment of the Complainant and by applying the guidelines without
any regard to the Complainant's condition
and the reports of his treating
medical practitioners.
<P>

22	In its Points of Defence, STA admitted paragraph 6 and denied paragraphs 28
and 29.  The Points of Defence introduced no new
fact or subject matter except
that in the final paragraph a defence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54</a> was set up.
<P>

23	The Tribunal is not a court of strict pleading and Mr Sloey was entitled by
any proper means to prove discrimination on the ground
of disability.  It was
obvious that he had a disability, namely coronary artery disease, and, as will
appear, that STA's discrimination
was grounded on that disability.  Shortly
before counsel for STA addressed the Tribunal in the manner I have indicated,
counsel for
Mr Sloey had said this in part -
<P>

		The issues in this case are going to be whether or not what it was that Mr
Sloey suffered was a disability under the terms of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a>;
whether the application was reasonable to these guidelines given that there was
no individual consideration by the STA of Mr Sloey's
medical condition and
thirdly, whether or not as I understand my friend's position will be that under
the Occupational Health &amp;
Safety <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and I think a couple of other acts,
the State Transit Authority has certain obligations and these guidelines are a
manifestation
of those obligations.  (sic)
<P>

24	The first two grounds argued in this Court were that the Tribunal erred in
law -
<P>

		(ii)	in holding that coronary graft heart surgery was, within the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 49B(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-discrimination Act</a>, a characteristic that
appertained generally to persons who had single vessel coronary disease;
<P>

		(iii)	in holding that coronary graft heart surgery was, within the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 49B(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-discrimination Act</a>, a characteristic that
appertained generally to persons who had single vessel coronary disease in the
absence of evidence, or against
the weight of the evidence, to that effect;
<P>

25	In its reasons for judgment the Tribunal said this -
<P>

		The Complainant relies on the direct discrimination provisions of this
section.  It is clear that the STA treated Mr Sloey less
favourably by not
allowing him to drive buses for 12 months after his bypass surgery.  this
restriction was not applied to other
drivers without Mr Sloey's disability,
i.e. to people in the same circumstances as Mr Sloey.  The question is whether
this action
by the STA was on the ground of Mr Sloey's disability.
<P>

26	The Tribunal then set out the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 49B(2)</a> and continued -
<P>

		The action of the STA was on the ground that Mr Sloey had had bypass surgery.
Mr Sloey's disability was a heart condition, and
he argued that a
characteristic appertaining to people who have such conditions is that they
have bypass surgery.  Whilst this does
not, of course, apply to all people who
have a heart condition, it is certainly a remedy sought by many.  In his
evidence Dr Garvan
agreed that bypass surgery was a common treatment for Mr
Sloey's disability.  The Tribunal accepts the Complainant's argument that
bypass surgery would, for a person with a heart condition, fall into the
purview of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 2</a> of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 49B.</a>
<P>

27	STA first submitted in this Court that Mr Sloey did not dispute in the
Tribunal that STA's decision was based on the fact that
coronary artery bypass
surgery had recently been performed and that the Tribunal itself appears to
have accepted the argument.
<P>

28	Counsel for Mr Sloey before the Tribunal was in no position, of course, to
determine how STA might put its case, but there is
nothing in the transcript
that bears out STA's submission that Mr Sloey there accepted the proffered
reason as the actual reason.
 There is a passage in the reasons for judgment
which I have quoted, namely the reference to the argument on behalf of Mr Sloey
that
a characteristic appertaining to relevant people is that they have bypass
surgery, but the transcript shows and counsel are agreed
that no such argument
was put forward on behalf of Mr Sloey.
<P>

29	It appears clear that Mr Sloey's case before the Tribunal was that he had a
disability, namely a past disability consisting of
blockage of a coronary
artery, and that STA had discriminated against him in his work on the ground of
that disability.  He had no
need to resort to characteristics of persons having
that disability or generally imputed to persons who have that disability for
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 49B(2).</a>
<P>

30	The direct attack on the Tribunal's finding under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 49B(2)</a> was in two parts.
First it was submitted that on the ordinary meaning of the word characteristic,
bypass surgery is not a characteristic
of persons who have blockage of the
coronary artery.
<P>

31	Counsel referred to the Macquarie Dictionary definition of the word as "a
distinguishing feature or quality", to the Shorter
Oxford Dictionary definition
of "serves to indicate character; distinctive; typical ... as a distinctive
mark; a distinguishing peculiarity
or quality" and to the adoption of that
definition in <b><u>Bear v Norwood Private Nursing Home</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20EOC%2092%2d109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) EOC
 92-109</a>, in which it was held that the word "characteristic" in South
Australian legislation meant "a character which is distinguishing peculiarity
or quality".
<P>

32	I think that this submission puts the matter slightly inaccurately, because,
however STA put its case, it is clear that Dr Garvan
relied not on coronary
artery graft surgery in general or in the abstract but on the fact that Mr
Sloey had undergone that surgery.
 That being so, I think that if it was
appropriate for the Tribunal to consider whether STA discriminated on the
ground of a characteristic
that appertained generally to persons who had the
disability rather than on the ground of the disability itself, the proper
question
for the Tribunal to answer was whether it was a distinguishing
peculiarity or quality of persons suffering blockage of a coronary
artery that
they often underwent coronary artery graft surgery.  It seems to me that any
tendency of such patients to undergo such
surgery may be described, without
straining the ordinary meaning of the words, as a characteristic or a
distinguishing peculiarity
or quality that they have.
<P>

33	The second submission was that there was no evidence that such people resort
to such surgery and that this was not a matter of
which the Tribunal was
entitled to take notice.  I should observe that the passage in the Tribunal's
reasons for judgment referring
to the evidence of Dr Garvan was agreed by
counsel to be mistaken.  Dr Garvan was not asked whether bypass surgery was a
common treatment
for persons with Mr Sloey's disability.
<P>

34	Although the Tribunal might not be entitled without evidence to conclude
that a particular person might or is likely to undergo
coronary artery graft
surgery because of a condition, it seems a different thing to say that it is
common knowledge that persons
having blockage of a coronary artery often resort
to coronary artery graft surgery.  I think that it is a matter of common
knowledge
that persons in that category have that distinguishing feature.  That
is a conclusion of fact that the Tribunal could have come to
without evidence.
I do not accept the arguments of the STA on the two grounds that I have dealt
with.
<P>

35	That is not the only answer to STA's argument, however, because the passage
of the judgment which I have quoted and STA's attack
on it have really raised a
false issue.  As I have explained, Mr Sloey's case in the Tribunal was that he
had a disability and that
it was because of that disability that STA had
discriminated against him.  The Tribunal found the disability proved.  It was a
past
disability, namely coronary artery disease, manifesting itself in the
blockage of a coronary artery.  Because, for the reasons I
have explained, Mr
Sloey did not need to resort to the definitions of "characteristic" for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s49b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 49B(2)</a>, it seems to me that the Tribunal's reference to those
supposed arguments in the passage of the judgment which I have quoted do not
accurately state the issues which were before it for determination.
<P>

36	If I were to conclude that in misconstruing Mr Sloey's case and stating its
reasons accordingly the Tribunal made an error of
law, it would become
necessary to consider whether a declaration should be made to that effect and
the matter remitted to the successor
to the Tribunal to be dealt with according
to law.  If that were done there could be only one result.  Notwithstanding
what STA submitted
to the Tribunal and to this Court, its real reason for
acting as it did was not that Mr Sloey had had surgery.  Although that was
the
event which excited consideration of his fitness for work by reference to the
standards, that did not mean that the surgery was
the reason why Mr Sloey was
considered unfit for work.  The evidence shows that he was considered unfit
because he had a disability
and, notwithstanding surgery, presented a greater
risk of the occurrence of symptoms than a driver who did not have that
disability.
 This appears from the evidence of Dr Garvan in the following
passages -
<P>

		Q.	If you were to assess an employee of the State Transit Authority for his
ability to return to his occupation as a bus driver,
would it not be that your
medical assessment, as you call it, involved getting sufficient reports from
either the employees own doctors
or a report from an independent specialist as
to that person's condition?
<P>

		A.	In this case, no.
<P>

		Q.	Why in this case is that not the case?
<P>

		A.	The only report I required in this case was the first one.  The one from
Dr Brady dated--
<P>

		Q.	18 March I think that might be.  Is that right?
<P>

		A.	Yes, 18 March.
<P>

		Q.	That's the one that's annexed to your statement:
<P>

		A.	That's the only one I absolutely require is that one.
<P>

		Q.	And why was that the only one that you required?
<P>

		A.	Because my task was to match up what had happened to him with the national
standard under which we operated.
<P>

		Q.	Is there anything other than the national standards that you have regard
to when you're assessing the employees?
<P>

		A.	No.
<P>

		Q.	So your own assessment or the assessment of an employee's treating doctors
as to a person's ability or capacity to do the work,
that doesn't form any part
of your assessment?
<P>

		A.	Not when a condition quite clearly falls within - or falls under one of
the articles in the national standard.  When it quite
clearly falls within that
purview of that article, no, there's no need to obtain any other advice.
<P>

		...
<P>

		Q.	When you said Mr Sloey is not fit to drive a bus, you did that solely on
the basis that the condition that he suffering from
is set out within these
standards and you looked at the standards relating to his particular condition
and said "Mr Sloey is not
fit to drive a bus"?
<P>

		A.	Yes, as per--
<P>

		Q.	Notwithstanding the fact that Dr Brady had said directly to you, "In my
opinion he will be fit to return to normal duties within
three months of his
operation".  Notwithstanding that Mr Sloey was also consulting a cardiologist
from whom you could've obtained
a report as to his medical condition"
<P>

		A.	You're quite right, notwithstanding both of those things.
<P>

		Q.	You still said "because the standards tell me that Mr Sloey suffers from
angina and as a consequence has had some surgery to
relieve him of that, he is
not fit to drive a bus for 12 months"?
<P>

		A.	Quite.  It was primarily because he'd undergone the surgery.  He was not
fit to be considered to drive a bus for 12 months.
 At 12 months he could be
reviewed and reconsidered, which is what happened.  But in answer to your
question, yes, despite the fact
that I'd had that advice from one specialist
and could've no doubt got the same advice on the other.
<P>

		...
<P>

		Q.	Can I split it up and ask the same question but twice.  What is it about
angina that puts a person at a greater risk than another
person who doesn't
have angina for example?
<P>

		A.	Well a person with angina has heart disease and the clinical pattern of
that sort of heart disease which is due to disease
of the arteries, coronary
arteries, is such that these people are at increased risk of having both a
heart attack, a myocardial infarct
or even sudden death.  So we're not talking
about a healthy person now, we're talking about some one who has a diseased
state and
that can aversely effect them whilst driving a bus compared with
somebody who does not have that diseased state.
<P>

		Q.	A person having an angina attack, what is it about their condition, their
state that also creates a risk?
<P>

		A.	Well it's a painful condition and it's also a condition that's described
as causing a good deal of anxiety in people who suffer
from it and it distracts
them.  Like all painful conditions it's distracting and distraction is one
thing you shouldn't have bus
drivers undergoing.
<P>

		Q.	What about the difficulties that are associated with somebody who has had
bypass surgery?
<P>

		A.	Well I understand and I repeat I'm not an expert in the academiology of
coronary disease or post operative coronary - or persons
who've had coronary
surgery but I am led to believe that these people are still - despite the fact
they've had surgery are still
at increased risk compared with the non diseased
population of having -
<P>

		CHAIRPERSON:  A.  I'm sorry Doctor I missed that.  These people are still at
-
<P>

		A.	Despite the fact that they've had the surgery they are still at increased
risk of having a coronary episode, heart attack or
sudden death because they
still have an underlying disease condition.
<P>

37	STA's argument on the first two grounds accordingly fails.
<P>

38	I shall deal together with the two other grounds that were argued.  They
assert that the Tribunal erred in law -
<P>

		(iv)	in holding that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 54</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a> and Section 16
of the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act 1983, did not operate to render any
action by the Plaintiff not in breach

<P>

standards published in the document Medical Examinations of Commercial Vehicle
Drivers published by the National Road Transport
Commission and the Federal

not in breach of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-discrimination Act</a>;
<P>

39	STA was obliged to comply with the provisions of the Occupational Health and
Safety Act 1983.  Relevantly, ss 15 and 16 are as
follows -
<P>

		<b>15	Employers to ensure health, safety and welfare of their
employees</b>
<P>

			(1)	Every employer shall ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of
all the employer's employees.
<P>

			(2)	Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an employer
contravenes that subsection if the employer fails:
<P>

				(a)	to provide or maintain plant and systems of work that are safe and
without risks to health, 
<P>

				...
<P>

				(e)	to provide or maintain a working environment for the employer's
employees that is safe and without risks to health and adequate
as regards
facilities for their welfare at work, or
<P>

employment are not exposed to risks to their health or safety
arising from the
conduct of the employer's undertaking while they are at the employer's place of
work.
<P>

			...
<P>

40	The Tribunal was told that STA had "formally adopted" the standards in early
1995.  The exact nature of the "adoption" was not
explained.  It was not
submitted that any statute or statutory rule in terms compelled STA to apply
the standards and it was not
submitted in this Court that the Tribunal was
wrong in concluding that the standards do not have the force of a law.  STA
contended
in the Tribunal that the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the
standards combined to produce the necessity to certify unfit
to drive a bus
persons who had suffered from coronary artery disease as a result of which they
had had coronary artery graft surgery
within the last 12 months.  Its case
seems to have been that its voluntary adoption and application of the standards
was a means
by which it met its obligations under the Occupational Health and
Safety Act.
<P>

41	In its reasons for judgment the Tribunal said this -
<P>

		There is no doubt that the STA is mandated to protect wherever possible
public safety.  This obligation not only exists in occupational
health and
safety legislation but in the authority's own governing legislation.  However,
the Tribunal is not satisfied that the
rigorous and inflexible interpretation
of the relevant guidelines, with no consideration for the individual
circumstances of Mr Sloey's
case, is a mandatory duty pursuant to either of
these pieces of legislation, and therefore covered by the exception in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
45(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a>.
<P>

		The Standards do not have the force of a law.  They are developed by medical
practitioners, experienced in the relevant areas
of medicine, to provide
guidance for those making decisions regarding the granting of drivers licences.
It is a most appropriate
practice for the STA to adopt such standards, but such
adoption gives them no greater force.  They have not been put before the
Parliament,
and are simply a code of practice adopted by a statutory authority.
As such the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 54</a> exception does not apply to them directly.
<P>

		Rigorous compliance with the standards must therefore be assessed in the
context of the STA's more general duties under its legislation
and occupational
health and safety legislation.  The sections of the standards quoted in the
evidence make it clear that they are
to be used as guidelines, and that the
individual circumstances of each case should be considered.  Dr Garvan did not
take this course.
 He did not physically examine Mr Sloey, he did not ask for a
report from his cardiologist.  In fact, it was clear from Dr Garvan's
evidence
that Mr Sloey fell into a category described by the standards and that was the
end of the matter.  Whilst the protection
of the public must weigh heavily on
the mind of the STA it is not so onerous as to allow the standards to achieve a
mandatory status
for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 54</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination
Act</a>.
<P>

42	STA submitted that this was a misdirection and that STA's obligations under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> Occupational Health and Safety Act required the literal
application of the standards which in turn required any bus driver to be
certified unfit to drive during the 12-month period immediately after coronary
artery graft surgery.  Such certification being necessary,
STA had a defence
under s 54 of the Act.  Although ground (iv) would appear to put the case more
widely, STA did not argue in the
Tribunal or in this Court that the necessity
to discriminate arose other than by the application of the standards.
<P>

43	STA's submissions incorporate two propositions: first, that the need to
comply with ss 15 and 16 Occupational Health and Safety
Act obliged STA to
apply literally the provisions of the standards and secondly that the necessary
result of the literal application
of the standards was that all employees must
be certified unfit to drive a bus within 12 months after coronary artery graft
surgery.
<P>

44	It was submitted that the obligations of an employer under s 15 are onerous.
"Ensure" means "guarantee", "secure" or "make certain".
 <b><u>Carrington
Slipways Pty Limited v Callaghan</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2011%20IR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 11 IR 467.</a>
<P>

45	Section 16 imposes upon every employer an obligation not to expose members
of the public to risks to their health or safety arising
from the conduct of
its undertaking while they are at the employer's place of work.
<P>

46	Failure to comply with the provisions of these sections attracts heavy
penalties.
<P>

47	It was submitted that their effect was to require STA to take whatever
action might be possible to guard against risks to safety.
<P>

48	The argument was put in the following way.  The standards, which were not
challenged below, established that drivers in Mr Sloey's
condition were more
likely than other drivers to suffer symptoms.  Sometimes no warning occurs
before the onset of symptoms, including
heart attack.  Symptoms may be
misinterpreted or ignored.  Serious injury or death to passengers, other
drivers and pedestrians may
follow.  Although medical and surgical treatment of
ischaemic heart disease may lead to the alleviation of symptoms and improved
life expectancy, coronary arteriosclerosis is a progressive process and the
risk of heart attack, collapse and sudden loss of consciousness
is greater in
people who suffer from that disease than in people that do not.
<P>

49	The stated object of the standards was to promote uniform or consistent road
transport policies and practices throughout the
country in order to enhance
road safety.
<P>

50	The drivers of buses operated by STA work eight to nine-hour shifts.  Their
buses carry up to 80 passengers at a time.  If the
driver of a bus collapsed it
would be very difficult for anyone else to get control of the vehicle.  Buses
are not equipped with
automatic locks or brakes.  If a driver lost control of a
moving bus, the safety of other drivers, pedestrians and passengers would
be
put at risk.  STA's obligation under ss 15 and 16 was to remove that risk.
<P>

51	Ss 15 and 16 create offences of absolute liability, and consequently no
<i>mens rea</i> need be proved and there is no "defence" of honest and
reasonable mistake.  <b><u>Shannon v Comalco Aluminium Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2019%20IR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)

207.</a>
<P>

52	A defendant employer prosecuted for an offence under s 15 or s 16 may set up
the defence under s 53 of the same Act to the effect
that it was not reasonably
practicable to comply with the relevant statutory provision or that the
commission of the offence was
due to causes over which the employer had no
control and against the happening of which it was impracticable to make
provision. 
However, the Tribunal has held that such defences are to be
disregarded in proceedings in which an employer pleads necessity under
s 54 of
the Act in an action based upon its discrimination against an employee.
<b><u>Kitt v Tourism Commission</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20EOC%2092%2d196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) EOC  92-196</a>; <b><u>Bugden v

of that principle was not challenged in the hearing before this Court.
<P>

53	The burden of proving necessity for the purposes of s 54 lay on STA.
Although it was entitled to point to the heavy duty resting
upon it because of
ss 15 and 16 Occupational Health and Safety Act I think that in order to
establish the defence of necessity it
had to do more than prove that Mr Sloey
fell into a category of drivers who epidemiologically presented an increased
risk of symptoms.
 In my opinion STA had to show that it was necessary to
certify Mr Sloey himself unfit to drive a bus.  That is to say, STA was obliged
to consider the risks that Mr Sloey presented as an individual.
<P>

54	There is authority for this approach.  In <b><u>Kitt v Tourism
Commission</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20EOC%2092%2d196" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) EOC  92-196</a> an employee suffered from epilepsy
and his employer discriminated against him because of what was said to be his
proneness to suffer
seizures, either because it was a characteristic which
appertained generally to persons suffering from epilepsy or one which was
generally imputed to such persons.  The Tribunal took the view that it was
insufficient merely to look at the risks that might be
presented by a person in
a category but necessary to consider the circumstances of the employee himself.
The Tribunal said this at
76,886-7:
<P>

	The respondent's argument, put shortly is this.  If Mr Kitt were to suffer an
epileptic seizure while working as a caves guide,
then the safety of visitors
to the caves and, possibly, other employees, would be threatened.  Accordingly,
his employment as a guide
was inconsistent with the employer's obligations
under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.  It was therefore necessary that
his
employment be terminated in order to comply with that Act.
<P>

	By virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec. 109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a>, the burden of
establishing this defence lies upon the respondent.  It must be affirmatively
proved that the respondent's obligations
under the Occupational Health and
Safety Act required that Mr Kitt be dismissed from his employment as a guide;
or to put it another
way, that the continued employment of Mr Kitt constituted
such a risk to the safety of other persons within the caves that the employer
was obliged to dismiss him in order to comply with the legislation..
<P>

	There is no concept of reasonableness imported here.  The question is not one
of what the employer believed, nor of whether any
such belief was reasonably
held or based upon adequate grounds.  The sole question is whether, from an
objective point of view, Mr
Kitt's employment constituted a risk to the safety
of other persons, within the meaning of sec. 15(1) and 16(1) of the
Occupational
Health and Safety Act.
<P>

	From a practical point of view, no issue would be likely to arise under this
legislation unless Mr Kitt actually suffered a major
seizure while at work for
it is the consequences of such a seizure which are regarded by the employer as
constituting a risk to the
safety of caves visitors or other employees.
Accordingly, in determining whether this defence is made out, it is necessary
to consider
two factual matters: first, the likelihood of Mr Kitt suffering a
seizure while at work; and secondly, the likely consequences if
he did so.
<P>

55	In <b><u>Bugden v State Rail Authority of NSW</u></b> it was held similarly
that it was necessary in order to consider the defence under s 54 of the Act to
look at the personal circumstances
of the employee.
<P>

56	In <b><u>Clinch v Commissioner of Police</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20EOC%2092%2d203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) EOC  92-203</a> a
defence of necessity failed and discrimination was held to have been unlawful
because the applicant was rejected on the ground
of his impairment alone,
without regard to his individual capabilities.
<P>

57	Counsel for STA relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal, Victoria in
<b><u>H J Heinz Co Australia Limited v Turner</u></b>, 1 July 1998 unreported.
The appellant discriminated against the respondent, applying a blanket policy
of denying overtime because
he fell into a category of persons classified fit
only for restricted duties.  The decision to do so was made without assessment
of his individual capabilities.  The respondent brought proceedings in the
Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, Victoria and the appellant
set up a defence under
s 21(4) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/eoa1984250/" class="autolink_findacts">Equal Opportunity Act 1984</a> (Victoria), which excluded from the
purview of the Act discrimination which was authorised or required by or under
any law, including
a law of Victoria.  The law relied on by the appellant was s
21 Occupational Health and Safety Act which provided that an employer
should
"provide and maintain so far as is practicable for employees a working
environment that is safe and without risks to health."
 The burden of proving
that the appellant's action was not authorised or required by that section lay
on the respondent.
<P>

58	It seems to me that the defence under s 21(4) of the Victorian Act and that
under s 54 are unalike.  To say that the application
in a particular way of a
blanket policy is authorised by an Act is one thing.  It is quite a different
thing to say that it is necessary
for an employer to act in a particular way in
order to comply with a requirement of another Act or statutory instrument.  I
find
the case of no assistance.
<P>

59	In my opinion the Tribunal was correct in concluding that it was not
necessary for STA, in order to comply with the requirements
of ss 15 and 16
Occupational Health and Safety Act to apply the standards without regard to the
individual capabilities of Mr Sloey.
<P>

60	In any case, an examination of the standards themselves shows that they are
not intended to be applied unquestioningly without
regard to the circumstances
of the individual person against whom a licensing authority or employer is
considering discriminating.
 On the contrary, the standards promote a flexible,
informed approach.  They begin by advocating sensitive treatment and the making
of decisions on the best available evidence.  They acknowledge the existence of
rapid advances of medical knowledge and the consequent
need for the review of
standards.  As though to illustrate this point, the Tribunal was informed that
a later edition of the standards
had substituted three months for 12 months as
the period during which drivers who had undergone coronary artery graft surgery
present
epidemiologically or statistically an increased risk of the occurrence
of symptoms.
<P>

61	Next, the standards are intended to assist medical practitioners who are
conducting medical examinations.  That implies that
those medical practitioners
are to give weight not only to the standards generally but to the results of
the examinations of particular
drivers.  And that seems to be only common
sense.  Drivers falling into Mr Sloey's category may be expected to have a wide
range
of conditions and symptoms.  Some will have suffered myocardial
infarction and some not; some will have sustained heart damage and
some not;
some will have symptoms and some not; some will perform satisfactorily in
medical examinations and some not.  If techniques
exist which can measure the
degree of risk presented by individual drivers who are shown only statistically
to be in a category of
drivers who present a higher risk of symptoms, it seems
to me that the standards expect them to be used.
<P>

62	These conclusions are supported by the requirements of the standards that
the final decision whether to certify rests with the
licensing authorities
(which must be taken here to refer to any employer making similar decisions)
and that examining medical officers
are expected to keep themselves appraised
of major changes in medical knowledge which may influence their assessment of
drivers.
<P>

63	In my opinion the Tribunal was correct in observing that the standards show
themselves as intended to be used only as guidelines.
<P>

64	Of course, as the Tribunal found, the STA made no attempt to apply the
standards.  There was no medical officer appraised of
changes in medical
knowledge, no medical examination of Mr Sloey and no informed judgment, using
the terms of the standards, "about
the impact of single or multiple conditions
on the whole person function" of Mr Sloey.  On the contrary, as soon as Dr
Garvan obtained
confirmation from Dr Brady that surgery had been carried out he
regarded the matter as closed.
<P>

65	The fourth and fifth grounds are not made out.
<P>

66	The summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff must pay the first defendant's
costs in an amount to be agreed or assessed.
