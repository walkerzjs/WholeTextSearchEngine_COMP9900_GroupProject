<b><u>11419/98  -  GEMTAF PTY LTD &amp; ORS  v  TRADEBANC INTERNATIONAL PTY
LIMITED [No 1]</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT  (re Sufficiency of Stated Case)</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   In this matter, an issue has arisen
concerning the sufficiency of the stated case which is before the Court.
Certain matters in
the course of argument were stated from the bar table by Mr
Bellanto QC, appearing for the respondents to the stated case, Tradebanc
International Pty. Limited. Those matters appear to me potentially material to
one of the issues raised by Mr Knaggs on behalf of
the appellants.
<P>

 
<P>

2  	In these circumstances, an application was made on behalf of
Tradebanc International Pty. Ltd to call evidence to deal with
that matter.
Part 32, rule 7 deals with the circumstance where a stated case is said to be
insufficient. It provides that, where
it appears to the Court that a stated
case does not state the facts and document sufficiently to enable the Court to
decide the questions
arising, or otherwise hear and determine the proceedings
on the stated case, the Court may  receive evidence, make findings of fact,
and
add to the stated case in accordance with the findings of fact of the Court.
<P>

 
<P>

3  	That power may not be exercised in criminal proceedings.  The
submission has been made that the power is confined to material
which was
before the Magistrate.  It is not open to the respondent, therefore, to
supplement that material by matters which were
not canvassed before the
Magistrate.
<P>

 
<P>

4  	However, the rule does not say that, nor do I believe it arises
through any necessary implication.  Matters may occur to the
appellate Court,
in this case, the Supreme Court, which were not canvassed in the Court below,
but which are necessary to deal with
the issues.
<P>

 
<P>

5  	In those circumstances, I believe there is a general power to
supplement the stated case in any way thought relevant to the
resolution of the
real issues which separate the parties. Therefore, I believe there exists in
this case a need to do so and I will
permit Mr Bellanto, therefore, to call
such evidence.
<P>

 
<P>

6  	If it should transpire that the particular matter is material to
the ultimate resolution of the dispute, then that may have
an impact upon the
costs which are payable in the action.
<P>

 
<P>

7  	I should also indicate the particular issue in respect to which
there appears to me to be some deficiency in the material within
the stated
case is the way in which the system operated by Tradebanc International Pty Ltd
deals with money which it requires a member
to repay in order to reduce the
level of the indebtedness from a particular level to a level which is within
the credit limit determined
by Tradebanc.
