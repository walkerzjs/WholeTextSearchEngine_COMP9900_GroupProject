<P>

Plaintiff
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>20 December 1999</b>
<P>

1   	It remains for me to give brief reasons in relation to the
orders I have earlier made approving the scheme of arrangement whereby
GIO
Australia Holdings Limited ("GIO") will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AMP
Insurance Investment Holdings Pty Limited ("AMP").
 The consideration will be
provided by a company in the AMP group conveniently referred to as AMPII, being
AMP Group Finance Services
Limited.  It is not necessary that I recite the key
features of the scheme for present purposes, as that is sufficiently set forth
in the scheme documents.
<P>

2   	The scheme meetings have taken place and the result is an
overwhelming majority in favour of the scheme.  By number of shares,
the
percentage in favour is 97.27% of those present and voting and by number of
shareholders 95.75% of those present and voting.
 Furthermore, there has been a
substantial participation of shareholders in that the shares voted represent
51.28% of the minority
shares on issue.  The other necessary formalities to
enable the scheme to be approved have been the subject of extensive affidavit
material and based on that material can be taken to have been satisfied. 
<P>

3   	The holder of some 2.5% of the total issued capital, GPG
Australia Nominees Limited ("GPG"), has attended Court to-day having
previously
foreshadowed opposition to the Scheme.  No vote was cast in respect of these
shares at the relevant scheme meetings either
for or against.  Whilst through
Counsel GPG stated that it was not satisfied in relation to many of its
concerns, and as to unspecified
conduct of AMP and GIO in the course of
implementing the scheme proposal which it considered not justified and possibly
illegal,
GPG expressly confirmed two things.  First was that it did not wish to
deprive other minority shareholders of realising the shares
under the only
practicable and sensible alternative.  Second, that none of their concerns were
such as should be put to this Court
as going to the fairness of the Scheme for
the purpose of its approval to-day.  
<P>

4   	The Scheme has been the subject of a letter from ASIC dated
17 December 1999 in the usual terms indicating no objection to
the Scheme.  I
am satisfied that such letter is in accordance with s411(17)(b) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> such that I do not need to consider whether s411(17)(a)
would in the circumstances preclude this Court approving the Scheme.  That
of
course does not remove the Court's discretion insofar as it arises in
considering whether or not to approve the Scheme pursuant
to s411(6) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

5   	Prior to to-day's hearing affidavit material was provided
to the Court both by GIO and AMP from the relevant responsible officers
as to
the circumstances in which the announced original terms of the Scheme were
varied downwards so as to become the Scheme presently
before me.  GPG disavowed
any submission that that material or any other matter bearing on the downward
variation should, in the
circumstances, have led either to the earlier
revocation of my orders convening the scheme meetings or now to denial of
approval
to the scheme at this hearing.  That affidavit material is part of the
Court file and was also made available at the request of GPG
to GPG.  No
submission was put to me that the terms upon which it was made available were
in any way objectionable.  Certain of that
material was only made available to
Counsel and Solicitors for GPG under obligations of confidentiality.
<P>

6   	In order to allay any concern that GPG may have been placed
in any preferred position, I have asked and this has been agreed,
that such
material be made available for inspection to any other shareholder of GIO via
the solicitors for GIO and AMP, upon a similar
basis mutatis mutandis as
applied to GPG.  
<P>

7   	One particular feature of this Scheme has been that the
financial situation of GIO particularly as regards its reinsurance
business,
has not remained static.  It has varied but only adversely from that set out in
the Scheme documents, though it is fair
to say that the Scheme documents had
foreshadowed that possibility quite explicitly.
<P>

8   	Under the arrangements set out in the Merger Implementation
Agreement with AMP and reflected in conditions of the Scheme itself,
AMP has
been engaged in a continuing due diligence exercise in relation to GIO having
regard to its capacity to terminate its involvement
if certain specified
trigger events occur.  (In the events that happened, the relevant termination
was not triggered.)
<P>

9   	That circumstances of a foreshadowed prospect of an adverse
change of circumstances in relation to GIO poses this question.
 What steps if
any should the Court take in the approval process to ensure that shareholders
are properly informed of matters material
to the members' decision, in terms of
Schedule 8 of the Regulations to the <i>Corporations Law</i>;  compare
<i>Cleary &amp; Anor v Australian Co-opertive Foods Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2052%20ACSR%20701" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 52 ACSR
701</a> per Austin J.
<P>

10   	Clearly participants in a scheme of arrangement should not
be placed in a worse position as regards disclosure than offerees
under a
conventional takeover offer within the broad notion of materiality.
<P>

11   	In order to meet these concerns, whilst recognising the
intrinsic confidentiality of some of this information (though I was
assured not
such as to  require to be disclosed under the ASX continuing disclosure
obligations) both GIO and AMP through the relevant
responsible officers have
agreed to provide by way of further affidavit the following confirmation.  That
confirmation covers two
matters:
<P>

(a)	that the material inspected by AMP is not such as would give rise to a more
favourable picture of GIO's position than that disclosed
in the Scheme
documents and subsequent disclosure (namely the letters of 2 and 8 December
1999 and the ASX announcement of 8 and
10 December 1999); and.  
<P>

(b)	that there is no other information material to a shareholder making a
decision in relation to the Scheme that has not been so
disclosed, within the
knowledge of the responsible officer concerned (being, in the case of the GIO,
the Chairman Mr Mazoudier).

<P>

12   	Given that assurance and the earlier disclosure, no
further action is deemed necessary.  These later adverse events in relation
to
GIO could only induce acceptance, not deter it.  This is not a case where
adjourning the meeting with the opportunity to revoke
or alter any proxy by
reason of subsequent events would have been justified.  This is more especially
as that would have left shareholders
at continued risk from the consequences of
any further GIO financial deterioration and from AMP termination in
consequence, were
termination events thereby triggered.
<P>

13   	It remains to deal briefly with some matters raised by one
of the GIO shareholders, Mr Cachia.  The most fundamental matter
he raised is
whether such a scheme could validly expropriate the shareholder's shares in
light of the decision of the High Court
in <i>Gambotto v WCP Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
182 CLR 432.</a>  The short answer to that is to be found in the majority judgment
at 446 where it is clear that the High Court did not intend to
preclude such
compulsory acquisition as is provided for under schemes of arrangement or other
such statutory regimes where fairness
is appraised, though takeovers
masquerading as selective reductions of capital without the safeguards of an
associated scheme remain
for future consideration.  That of course assumes that
this scheme of arrangement satisfies the relevant statutory requirements.
<P>

14   	Mr Cachia raised various concerns about the disclosure in
the scheme documents which are recorded in the transcript.  I am
satisfied on
the material before me that there is no basis for treating the expert as other
than independent or to conclude that
the disclosure was other than adequate.
Necessarily there are limits to the degree to which the Court is able to probe
into the accuracy
or completeness of scheme documents.  In so doing it is
prompted by the matters revealed by the documentation itself or otherwise
drawn
to its attention, in what is usually not an adversarial process unless the
Scheme is contested.  This scheme was not.  The
Court must do what it
practically can, aided by the fact that ASIC scrutinises schemes and can be
expected to draw matters to the
Court's attention that have not been
satisfactorily dealt with.  None were drawn to the Court's attention and those
matters the Court
raised were dealt with before the Scheme documents were
despatched. Ultimately both the Court and even ASIC rely upon the scheme
proponents doing that which they are obliged to do by way of accurate, complete
and not misleading disclosure of all material information.
That is ultimately
sanctioned by civil penalties and civil liability. 
<P>

15   	I A Renard and J G Santamaria in "Takeovers and
Reconstructions in Australia" at 15,061 (footnotes abbreviated), accurately
and
conveniently state the nature of the Court's task in exercising its discretion
whether or not to approve the scheme, pursuant
to s411(6).  It is to be
remembered that it is not for the Court to usurp the shareholders' decision, by
attempting to intrude its
own commercial judgment, where there has been
adequate disclosure, compliance otherwise with legal requirements and the
scheme is
on its face sufficiently fair as to be capable of being put to the
shareholders for their approval or rejection.
<P>

"... the court will determine:  (1)  whether all the conditions required by
CLs411 have been complied with;  (2)  whether the majority
of members or
creditors, though acting regularly, have acted in good faith and not in pursuit
of some illegitimate purpose;  and
(3)  whether the proposal was `at least so
far fair and reasonable, as that an intelligent and honest man, who is a member
of that
class, and acting alone in respect of his interest as such member,
might approve it'.10  Fundamentally, the jurisdiction is supervisory;
 the
court is concerned to be satisfied that there has been an absence of oppression
and that the compromise or arrangement is one
which is capable of being
accepted:  see <i>Re Dorman Long &amp; Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1934%5d%20Ch%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1934] Ch 635</a>;  <i>Scottish
Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1949/1949_SC_HL_90.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%20AC%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] AC 462</a> at 486.

<P>

10	Per Fry LJ in <i>Re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railway
Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%201%20Ch%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 1 Ch 213</a> at 247.  
<P>

16   	I am on the material before me satisfied as to these three
matters.  Accordingly the Scheme has been approved.
