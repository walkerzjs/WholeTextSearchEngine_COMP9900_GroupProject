<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>22 June 1999</b>
<P>

<b>THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE</b>
<P>

1   	This is a case about costs; is a supporting creditor who
played a fairly passive role in the eventual winding up of a company
to be
allowed costs and, if so, to what extent and with what priority?
<P>

<b>BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

2   	On 26 May 1999 I gave judgment allowing a short adjournment
for a winding up application, doing so pursuant to 440A(2) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>. When the matter subsequently came back before me
creditors and the Court had the benefit of a report from the administrator. The
Administrator made clear that he had no confidence in the accuracy of the books
and records of Local Government Recycling Co-operative
Limited ("the Company")
as would enable any reliable decision as to its salvageability. Winding up
inevitably followed.
<P>

3   	The Applicant for the winding up was Waste Recycling and
Processing Services of NSW ("the Applicant"). However, throughout
the
proceedings SMS Municipal Services Pty Ltd ("SMS") were present as a supporting
creditor save for one day where, though present,
SMS determined that its
position would now become neutral. This was on the basis that Mr Star had
resigned as Administrator in favour
of an Administrator of whom it could not be
said there was any prior association. That took one day of neutrality out of
four hearing
days plus the further hearing day when the matter came back before
me -- more accurately for about 1 hour on that last day.
<P>

4   	The question before me is whether costs should be awarded
to SMS and, if so, the priority to be granted to any costs order.
The former
question is concededly a matter wholly within the discretion of the trial
judge; <i>FAI Workers Compensation v Philkor Builders</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 323</a>
per McLaughlin M. The latter question is affected by statute, but I have a
limited discretion, as I explain.
<P>

5   	The Liquidator has taken the position that while a cost
order is within power having regard to s556(1)(b) of the <i>Corporations
Law</i> and the decision of Bryson J in <i>Signature Resorts Pty Ltd &amp; Anor
v DHD Constructions Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2018%20ACSR%20627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 18 ACSR 627</a> at 633-4, my discretion
should be exercised having regard to s485(3) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
Section 485(3) provides:
<P>

<b>485(3) [Payment of costs where property insufficient]</b>  The Court may, in
the event of the property being insufficient to satisfy the liabilities, make
an order as to the payment out of
the property of the costs, charges and
expenses incurred in the winding up in such order of priority as the Court
thinks just."
<P>

That is, it should be exercised by, at the least, denying SMS any priority in
the liquidation of the Company for such cost order
as is made. The Liquidator
is faced with an undoubted deficiency of assets and with circumstances where
the Applicant was able, without
the necessity for support, to secure the
winding up. Naturally the Liquidator is concerned to minimise the effect on
creditors of
a generous cost order in favour of SMS.
<P>

6   	The role SMS played was a relatively passive one, though in
saying that I acknowledge that a more active role would have in
fact added to
costs and prolonged the proceedings to no good purpose. The justification for
SMS's presence is best found in its concern
that the attack upon the
Applicant's debt might have succeeded leaving SMS to fill the breach, though a
similar attack was levelled
at it. No doubt SMS was there also to protect its
own interests given that attack.
<P>

7   	The authorities are clear that the usual practice is that,
having awarded costs on a priority basis to the successful applicant,
supporting creditors as a class share in the one set of costs; see <i>Re Humber
Ironworks Company</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1866%5d%202%20LREQ%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1866] 2 LR(Eq) 15</a> per Lord Romilly at 18:
<P>

"Where the Court grants the prayer of the Petition, of course it will give no
costs to persons who appear to oppose the Petition;
because in that case the
Court makes an order against them: it gives the costs of the Petitioner and
those of the company out of
the estate; and if a number of persons, whether
shareholders or creditors, appear to ask for an order to wind up the company,
in
that case I am of the opinion that the Court ought to allow, out of the
estate, one set of costs amongst them all, and they must
arrange between
themselves in what manner they are entitled to such costs. I will not allow a
series of costs to them.
<P>

... Where the Court makes the order to wind up, and the shareholders and
creditors, together or separately, appear to support the
Petition one set of
costs is to be given amongst them, and only one. In this case there are four or
five parties who appear for that
purpose, and they must arrange between them
how the costs are to be distributed."
<P>

8   	This approach, in respect of supporting creditors who have
given notice of their intention to appear, is stated to be the "usual
practice"
where a winding up application is granted in "McPherson, Law of Company
Liquidation" (3rd Ed) at 93. (See also 1994 Student
Edition of McPherson;
current "Laws of Australia" at 4.7.49 [49]. See also <i>Brinds Ltd v Offshore
Oil NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20ACLC%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 ACLC 89</a> at 95 where <i>Re Humber</i> (supra) was considered
in relation to the issue of an opposing party's costs.
<P>

9   	The approach in <i>Re Humber</i> to costs where a petition
was granted was expressly endorsed in <i>Re European Banking Co.</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1866%5d%202%20LREQ%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1866] 2
LR(Eq) 521</a> by Kindersley VC, who stated at 523:
<P>

"Where a petition is presented, and shareholders and creditors appear to
support the petition, and an order for winding up is made
thereon, then the
shareholders who support the petition ought not to have separate sets of costs,
but all are to have one set of
costs only among them, and likewise all the
creditors who appear to support the petition are to have but one set of costs
among them."
<P>

Kindersley VC did not follow <i>Re Humber</i> in relation to costs of opposing
creditors and contributories where a petition failed.
<P>

10   	The concern in both these cases, so far as they concerned
supporting creditors, appeared to be whether separate orders for
costs should
be made in favour of each supporting creditor. They appear to presume that the
awarding of costs in favour of a supporting
creditor will follow the event of a
winding up application being made.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION AND ORDERS</b>
<P>

11   	In all the circumstances, I consider that the proper
course, drawing so far as necessary not only upon the undoubted discretion
of
the trial judge in cost orders generally, but also upon s485(3) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> to do as the Court thinks just as regards order of
priority, I award to SMS the costs of two days of the hearing being the first
two days, these to be as costs enjoying the priority accorded by s556(1)(b) of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>. In doing so I recognise that precision in these
matters is not possible but that approximate justice best serves the realities
of
the present situation. This is one where SMS could have played a lesser role
in terms of attendance by some informal arrangement
with those attending,
without real prejudice to the winding up application.
