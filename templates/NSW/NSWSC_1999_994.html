<i>Wednesday, 29 September 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3416 of 1997	JAMES GODFREY STROUD   -v-   VIOLET GRACE
SIMPSON-PHILLIPS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i>De Facto
Relationships Act </i>1984 (which is now known as the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1984298/" class="autolink_findacts">Property
(Relationships) Act</i> 1984</a>).
<P>

2   	By statement of claim filed on 31 July 1997 the plaintiff,
James Godfrey Stroud, claims orders adjusting the interests of himself
and the
defendant, Violet Grace Simpson-Phillips, in property, pursuant to section 20
of the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>. 
<P>

3   	It was not in issue that the parties had been in a de facto
relationship. However, the period of that relationship was disputed.
The
parties commenced co-habitation at 53 Topping Avenue, Sale, in Victoria. The
parties were in agreement that that cohabitation
commenced in January 1986, and
continued, after they moved to Sydney, in January 1987. On 2 July 1987 there
was born to the parties
a daughter, Chanelle Jaimi Violet La Tour-Stroud (who
is now aged eleven).
<P>

4   	According to the plaintiff (but denied by the defendant)
the parties ceased co-habitation in March 1989, although, for a period,
they
continued to reside in the same house. 
<P>

5   	It was the assertion of the plaintiff that the parties
resumed co-habitation in March 1992. 
<P>

6   	The defendant did not agree with those dates. Although in
her cross-claim the defendant asserted that the first period of the
relationship came to an end in January 1991, she said in her oral evidence in
chief that there appeared to be some mistake in that
regard, and that the
separation between the parties was from May 1990 to December 1991. Accordingly,
I have accepted that it is now
the case for the plaintiff that she asserts that
the first period of the relationship came to an end in May 1990, and that the
second
period of the relationship commenced in December 1991. Ultimately,
however, the defendant agreed that she had received a pension
(as a sole
parent) from the Department of Social Security from March 1989. She also agreed
under cross-examination that she had no
independent recollection of when the
separation between the parties commenced. 
<P>

7   	The final separation and the termination of the
relationship was on 28 January 1996.
<P>

8   	In the light of the foregoing concessions by the defendant
under cross-examination, and in the light of the defendant's income
tax return
for the year ended 30 June 1989 (including a statement of pension from the
Department of Social Security for disclosing
payment of a sole parent's pension
for the period 3 May 1989 to 30 June 1989) I am satisfied that the evidence of
the plaintiff that
the first period of the relationship terminated in March
1989 should be accepted. Although the plaintiff in his oral evidence said
that
he did not regard the defendant as his spouse during the period of separation,
his income tax returns for the period 1990 -
1992 disclose the defendant as
being identified as his spouse at least throughout the relevant taxation
years.
<P>

9   	The plaintiff was born on 10 October 1946, and is now aged
52 years; the defendant was born on 22 March 1948, and is now aged
51 years.
<P>

10   	At the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff's
assets consisted of investments of $10,000, furniture and personal
effects of
$5,000, and a superannuation entitlement of $82,000. The defendant owned
furniture and personal effects (including some
jewellery) having a value of
about $7,500. She owned a 1983 Mustang motor vehicle, and, according to her,
had a one half interest
in land in the United States of America. She also was
liable for repayment of a loan of $2,800.
<P>

11   	In 1987 (according to the defendant, in December of that
year) the parties purchased as joint tenants a house property situate
at and
known as 1 Narraburra Close, Mount Colah, for a purchase price of $148,000.
That purchase was funded by a mortgage from Citibank
in the sum of $63,000, a
loan from Esso (which was the plaintiff's employer at that time) in the sum of
$75,000, and the balance
of $10,000 from savings of the plaintiff. 
<P>

12   	At the time of the termination of the relationship the
assets of the parties consisted of the following:
<P>

House property at 1 Narraburra Close, Mount Colah - $215,000 (subject to
mortgage of $28,000 to St George Bank and to a further
mortgage of $10,000 to
St. George Bank).
<P>

Contents - $5,000
<P>

Holden motor vehicle - $5,500
<P>

Plaintiff's shareholdings and investments - $20,000
<P>

Plaintiff's superannuation entitlement - $264,000.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff is a computer programmer by occupation.
Apart from two relatively small periods, of a few months on each occasion,
the
plaintiff was in full-time (and relatively well-paid) employment throughout the
entirety of the relationship. The defendant was
not in full-time, and usually
not even in part-time, employment throughout the relationship. Certainly after
the birth of their daughter
Chanelle the defendant did not choose to be in
employment. 
<P>

14   	It was agreed between the parties that the present value
of the house property at Mount Colah (which is the substantial item
in dispute
in the present proceedings) is $265,000. It was further agreed that the value
of that house property at the time of the
termination of the relationship was
$215,000. 
<P>

15   	The defendant by her defence (filed on 23 October 1997)
opposed the relief sought by the plaintiff. By a cross-claim (also
filed on 23
October 1997) the defendant sought, <i>inter alia, </i>orders that the Mount
Colah property be transferred to her, that the plaintiff discharge the two
mortgages over that property, and
that the plaintiff pay the private school
fees of Chanelle at the Pymble Ladies College (although at the conclusion of
the hearing
that last claim for relief was expressly abandoned by the
defendant).
<P>

16   	Pursuant to the provisions of section 18 of the <i>De
Facto Relationships Act</i>, the defendant requires an appropriate order for
the extension of time in respect to any claim made by her concerning the first
period
of the relationship (from January 1986 until, according to the
plaintiff, March 1989, or, according to the defendant, May 1990) since,
whichever of the asserted dates be accepted as the date of termination of the
first period of the relationship, the present proceedings
were not instituted
within two years of that termination. At the outset of the hearing the
defendant filed a notice of motion seeking
such an extension of time. The
plaintiff does not consent to that extension of time. 
<P>

17   	The plaintiff seeks an order that the house property at
Mount Colah should be sold and the net proceeds of sale be divided
equally
between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant, on the other hand,
whilst agreeable to the sale of the house property,
claims the entirety of the
net proceeds of sale.
<P>

18   	A considerable part of the hearing was devoted to the
assertions of the plaintiff (which were vehemently denied by the defendant)
concerning an alleged gambling addiction of the defendant. 
<P>

19   	I am entirely satisfied that those assertions were true
and accurate, and that the defendant indulged in gambling at least
to the
extent asserted by the plaintiff.
<P>

20   	Throughout the entirety of each period of the relationship
the plaintiff was the principal breadwinner. It was his earnings
which
maintained the household and the family consisting of himself, the defendant
and, after her birth on 2 July 1987, their daughter
Chanelle.
<P>

21   	During the period of separation, from March 1989 until
March 1992 (throughout most of which period the plaintiff was not residing
in
the Mount Colah property), the plaintiff continued to make all the payments on
the housing loans in respect to the house property.
At various times throughout
the relationship the plaintiff paid the credit card liabilities of the
defendant.
<P>

22   	The defendant made little, if any, financial contribution
towards the household or towards the family unit. Indeed, to a very
large
extent (at least to an amount exceeding $14,000) the defendant expended money
on gambling, and was largely supported in that
activity by monetary advances
from the plaintiff. 
<P>

23   	To the extent that it is necessary for me to do so, I
express the view that I preferred the evidence of the plaintiff to that
of the
defendant. The plaintiff's evidence, especially concerning financial matters,
and advances by him to the defendant, was supported
by documentary material.
Where the evidence consisted of assertions made by one party and denied by the
other, and with no independent
or documentary material to support the evidence
of one or other of the parties, I prefer the evidence of the plaintiff to that
of
the defendant. 
<P>

24   	I have already referred to the notice of motion filed by
the defendant on 9 April 1999 seeking an extension of time in respect
to her
cross-claim. In the light of my ultimate conclusions, it is not necessary for
me to grant such an extension of time, since
whether or not I extend time,
there would be no practical difference in the outcome of the present
proceedings. Accordingly, I propose
to dismiss that notice of motion.
<P>

25   	In 1994 the plaintiff's employment with Esso was made
redundant. He received a total amount of $156,000 in redundancy payments
from
that employer. That amount was disbursed as follows:
<P>

Payment upon mortgage on house property - $91,000
<P>

Motor vehicle - $9,000
<P>

Expenditure on living expenses - $46,000
<P>

Investments - $10,000
<P>

26   	Attempts were made on behalf of the defendant to adduce
evidence concerning her present financial and material circumstances,
and in
particular, concerning what was alleged to be her present need. All that
material was totally irrelevant to any matter which
I must determine in the
present proceedings, which relate to an order for the adjustment of the rights
of parties in property, pursuant
to section 20 of the <i>De Facto Relationships
Act</i>. (See <i>Evans v Marmont</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a> per Gleeson CJ and
McLelland CJ in Eq.)
<P>

27   	The only contributions made by the defendant to the
relationship were in her roles as homemaker and mother. I do not consider
that
she devoted a great deal of her time or energy to fulfilling those roles.
Indeed, for very substantial parts of each of the
two periods of the
relationship it was the plaintiff who fulfilled the principal roles as
homemaker and as parent to Chanelle, since
the defendant was very frequently
absent from home, indulging her gambling addiction at various clubs and gaming
rooms.
<P>

28   	The plaintiff, as I have already recorded, seeks that the
house property should be sold and the net proceeds of sale divided
equally
between the parties. Counsel for the plaintiff emphasised that that relief was
what the plaintiff regarded as being fair
in all the circumstances. Were it not
for that attitude adopted by the plaintiff, I would have been disposed to make
an order giving
to the plaintiff considerably more than one half of the net
proceeds of sale. 
<P>

29   	Since the plaintiff seeks no more that one half of the net
proceeds of sale, I propose to make an order to that effect. Such
an order will
reflect a total success to the plaintiff in the proceedings. It would follow,
therefore, that he should have an order
that the defendant pay his costs.
However, since I have not heard any submissions concerning costs, I shall allow
to the defendant
an opportunity to be heard on costs, if she so desires.
Accordingly, unless within a period of seven days from the date hereof either
party arranges with my Associate to have the matter listed for argument as to
costs, the order will be that the defendant pay the
costs of the plaintiff.
<P>

30   	Since a number of items of relief sought by the parties
(especially those relating to the chattels and contents of the house
property,
and relating to the funds in the account described as "Chanelle's Trust") have
not been the subject of submissions, I propose
to stand the matter over to a
date to be fixed, for the bringing in of short minutes of order, to reflect my
foregoing conclusions.
Those short minutes should also include an order for
dismissal of the notice of motion filed by the defendant on 9 April 1999.
<P>

31   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I stand the matter over to a date to be fixed, for the bringing in of short
minutes of order.
<P>

2.	Unless within a period of seven days from the date hereof either party
arranges with my Associate to have the matter listed for
argument as to costs,
the short minutes will include an order that the defendant pay the costs of the
plaintiff.
