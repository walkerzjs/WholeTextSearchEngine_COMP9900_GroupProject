<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR.	</b>This is an application by Norman Howard
Wilson pursuant to s 13A of the <b><i>Sentencing Act 1987</i></b> for
re-determination of the life sentence imposed on him by Finlay J on 29 June
1990 following his conviction on 21 May 1990 for
the murder of his 18 year old
son, Dean Edward Wilson, at Nullamanna, near Inverell, on 1 September 1989.
The Crown does not oppose
the application.
<P>

2   	The applicant was born on 20 September 1944 and at the time
of the offence was aged 44 years and living in Inverell.  He and
his wife
Janelle had five children and his wife had another child from a previous
relationship.  The deceased was the second youngest
of the applicant's
children.
<P>

3   	On 19 June 1989 some three months before the offence, Mrs
Wilson left the family home, apparently as a result of continuing
marital
discord, the cause of which she attributed to the applicant, and moved to
Victoria leaving the applicant, his son Dean, then
aged 18 and their daughter
Melissa, then aged 14, living together at Inverell.
<P>

4   	On 3 August 1989, Craig Wilson, another son, purchased a
.22 magnum bolt action rifle from an Inverell sports store and a couple
of
weeks later had a discussion about the rifle with his father at Craig's home in
Bennett Street, Inverell.
<P>

5   	Late in August, Dean was successful in his application to
join the New South Wales Police Service which, according to the applicant's
wife and several of his children, displeased the applicant; but the applicant
claims he was in fact pleased and had encouraged his
son in his application.
<P>

6   	On Wednesday 30 August 1989 the applicant stole Craig's
rifle from where it was kept in the spare bedroom of the Bennett Street
house.
Late in the afternoon of the next day, the day before the murder, he placed the
rifle in his car.  The evidence at the trial
did not disclose when the rifle
was loaded.
<P>

7   	At 10 am on 1 September 1989, the applicant, by a ruse,
induced his son Dean, to accompany him on a drive to a dirt track off
the
Nullamanna Road, some 13 kilometres from Inverell.  During the drive the two
men argued, apparently about Mrs Wilson leaving
home.  The applicant told his
son to get out of the car and leave.  After his son left the car the applicant
also got out carrying
Craig's rifle.  With the men standing some four to five
feet apart the applicant shot Dean, the bullet penetrating his upper left
arm.
However, the  gunshot wound was not fatal and the applicant thereupon killed
his son with sustained acts of violence including
smashing his head with a
rock.  The applicant stated in his record of interview:
<P>

"I just went bang and when I seen blood I just went mad, I couldn't stop.  I
just kept going and hitting him, hitting him with anything
I could get my hands
on, with the rifle a rock, anything".
<P>

He then dragged the body some ten metres off the roadway and covered it with
vegetation.
<P>

8   	The applicant claimed that on his return journey to
Inverell he threw Dean's shoes and Craig's rifle out of the right hand
side of
the vehicle.  He later disposed of the bloodstained clothing he had been
wearing during the offence at the dump and that
afternoon went shopping at
Inverell with his daughter Melissa.
<P>

9   	He reported Dean missing to Inverell police the next day,
and two days later checked with police as to whether there was any
information
regarding his son's whereabouts.  On Wednesday 6 September, police searched the
applicant's Inverell residence.  After
the search, the applicant accompanied
police to Inverell Police Station.  The applicant appeared to break down and
agreed to take
police to the location of his son's body, which he did, and
pointed out Dean's body which was under a mound of branches, leaves and
grass.
<P>

10   	The deceased, who was lying on his back, had sustained
injures to his face and head, and in the crook of his right elbow between
his
arm and body was a large blood stained basalt rock.
<P>

11   	Whilst at the scene, the applicant admitted to the
detectives that he had killed Dean by shooting him with a .22 rifle.  He
then
went on to say, "I should have shot myself instead, I was going to and that's
when he grabbed the gun.  He tried to stop me
but the gun went off."
<P>

12   	On the return journey to Inverell the applicant indicated
to detectives the places where he claimed to have thrown the rifle
and Dean's
shoes from the car.
<P>

13   	At the police station the applicant took part in a signed
record of interview which contained admissions to the above effect.
<P>

14   	The next day he agreed to accompany detectives on a tour
of the area where he said he had disposed of the rifle, shoes and
other items,
but only one of the shoes was found and the rifle has never been located.
<P>

15   	The post-mortem examination disclosed a bullet in the
muscle above the left elbow and a number of compound comminuted fractures
of
the skull which the pathologist, Dr Hall, deposed at the trial were consistent
with having been inflicted with at least four or
five major blows with the very
heavy basalt rock found at the murder scene.  His opinion was the cause of
death was massive brain
injury associated with multiple compound fractures to
the skull.
<P>

16   	A motive for the crime has never been established,
although the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had been
significantly
depressed by his wife leaving him.
<P>

17   	Four days before the trial was due to commence Detective
Ferguson received a copy of an affidavit sworn by the applicant,
and dated the
previous day, in which he nominated three other persons as being responsible
for Dean's murder and stated that his
oldest son Craig was in some way involved
in the offence.  He subsequently took part in a further record of interview,
denying that
he was responsible in any way for his son's death, and at the
trial gave sworn evidence consistent with the affidavit and such further
record
of interview.  This version was obviously false and by its verdict of guilty
the jury clearly rejected it.
<P>

18   	In proceedings before me, the applicant claimed that
although he now accepts that he was responsible for his son's death and
that
the original version he gave the police must have been correct, he says he has
no recollection of the events and he accepts
responsibility on the basis of
what he has read.  If this is so, and was so, the second version shortly before
and at his trial,
must have been false because he had no memory of the event.
If, on the other hand, at the time, he did in fact remember what had
happened,
the second version was also false.  He is not, of course, to be punished for
telling lies, but the fact that he initially
furnished two different versions
created a number of difficulties for the sentencing judge and for the
psychiatrist who examined
him prior to the trial and sentencing.
<P>

19   	Dr Lucire examined the applicant before the trial on
behalf of the Crown and expressed the opinion that on the information
available
there was no evidence of any mental illness but considerable evidence of former
sociopathic traits and she went on:
<P>

"As the information he gives me is not reliable, I am unable to form an opinion
regarding, for example, the role of alcohol in his
marital break down and the
role alcohol might have played in the involvement in the act to which he
confessed.  As I am still unsure
of his alcohol use history, I cannot also say
whether alcohol played a part in his delaying reporting of the homicide. 
<P>

My impression is he is a simple man with a family and employment back ground
where a great deal of heavy drinking occurs with resultant
changes in
temperament and personality, and that he is not telling me the whole truth.
Indeed, I suspect if his wife complained,
she might have had something to
complain about.  
<P>

The case should be based purely on its legal merits.  There is no psychiatric
defence here."
<P>

20   	Dr Greenway had examined the applicant, prior to the
trial, on instructions from his solicitors.  His opinion was:
<P>

"At the moment Mr Wilson does not appear to be suffering from any psychiatric
disorder.  It does appear likely that he was significantly
depressed following
his wife's leaving.  He gives two entirely different accounts of his son's
death at least one of these is untrue.
 It is impossible to know from Mr
Wilson's evidence alone which one that is."
<P>

21   	Following his conviction but before sentencing, reports
were obtained from Mr Wayne Reid, psychologist, and Dr Jolly, psychiatrist.
 Mr
Reid said:
<P>

"I do not feel there is sufficient evidence to suggest an acquired organic
disorder, based on the information gained from my neuropsychological
assessment.  It is however my clinical opinion, based on Mr Wilson's complaints
of auditory hallucinations, and his presenting symptoms
of severe depression,
that he does have a significant psychiatric disorder (? a psychosis) that
requires further investigation."
<P>

22   	Dr Jolly said there was evidence of an alcohol induced
amnesia, and raised the possibility that the applicant was suffering
from a
condition called alcoholic hallucinosis, a condition similar to delirium
tremens.  He was also of the opinion that he suffered
a form of depressive
illness which flowed on primarily from his wife's leaving him and said he was
clinically depressed before the
subject incident, and it was severe depression,
a major psychiatric illness.  At the time the applicant had made at least two
serious
attempts at suicide.
<P>

23   	At the time he stood for sentence, s 19 of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></i></b> provided that a life sentence was mandatory
"unless it appears to the judge that the person's culpability for the crime is
significantly
diminished by mitigating circumstances whether disclosed by the
evidence in the trial or otherwise."  The provision had been considered
in
<b><i>R v Burke</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20NSWLR%2092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] NSWLR 92</a> and <b><i>R v Bell</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2
NSWLR 466</a>, and in effect it was held that the proviso referred to culpability
or blame worthiness relating to the offence itself, and not to
subjective
features such as might have been relevant on sentencing for any other
offence.
<P>

24   	Finlay J, whilst accepting that the prisoner was depressed
following his wife's leaving, and indeed had what may be called
a significant
depression in this regard, was far from satisfied that the crime was
significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances,
and accordingly the
proviso was not applied, and he sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for
life.
<P>

25   	Doctor Jolly has furnished a further report for the
purpose of these proceedings and given oral evidence before me in which
he
elaborated on that report.  In effect he is of the same opinion now as he was
then, namely, that the applicant, at the time of
committing the offence, was
suffering a major depressive illness and possibly had alcoholic hallucinosis.
It was submitted, therefore,
that I should find to that effect, thereby
mitigating the objective seriousness of the crime and resulting in a reduced
sentence
by way of minimum and additional terms than would otherwise have been
the case.
<P>

26   	Section 13A (10A) provides that on the re-determination of
a life sentence the Court must have regard to, and give substantial
weight to,
the observations and comments of the original sentencing court, or to the
extent that it declines to adopt or give effect
to such matters, state its
reasons for doing so.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that I am not bound by the
findings of the sentencing
judge if there are good reasons for departing from
them:  <b><i>R v Cox</i></b> (CCA - Unreported - 19 June 1997).
<P>

27   	Apart from the fact that Dr Lucire, after sentence was
passed, considered alcoholic hallucinosis as a possibility, but did
not do so
beforehand, there really is no relevant fresh evidence on the issue.
Diminished responsibility was not raised as a defence
at the trial; and in the
light of the evidence then available could not have been raised.  It is not
open to me, on these resentencing
proceedings, to make a finding based on Dr
Jolly's evidence that the applicant's responsibility was diminished to a
significant degree
and sentence him on that basis, as that would amount to
sentencing him for manslaughter and not for murder.  Doctor Jolly really
only
reaffirms the opinion he had at the time, that he was clinically depressed as a
result of his wife's leaving.  Finlay J accepted
that he was significantly
depressed at the time as a result of his wife's leaving, and so do I; but such
evidence as there is on
the subject shows that his wife left because of his
excessive drinking and violence towards her over a lengthy period.  As that was
what caused her to leave, which in turn led to his depression, it does not
reduce his culpability for the murder of his son.
<P>

28   	The applicant is now 55 years old and is in poor health.
He had a stroke a number of years ago which disabled the right side
of his body
from which he has almost completely recovered, but currently he is suffering
from emphysema which he says, and I accept,
affects him very badly. He has
trouble sleeping and has to sit bolt upright to sleep.  He cannot walk far, has
difficulty breathing
and has sprays to assist his breathing.
<P>

29   	He was born and grew up in Inverell.  His father was a
pound keeper and he is the youngest son having five brothers and one
sister.
His mother died when he was about 4 or 5 years old.  At the age of 11 or 12 he
was badly burnt whilst filling a cigarette
lighter which resulted in
hospitalisation for some 18 months and his schooling was thereby interrupted,
leaving him with significant
scars about which he was quite sensitive.  At the
time of his arrest, he did have low literacy skills but he has improved these
whilst
in custody. 
<P>

30   	His prior criminal record shows a number of stealing,
break and enter, and such like offences dating back to when he was a
juvenile
which I would not regard as significant in the context of this offence.  He
also had a conviction for driving under the
influence of alcohol in 1974 which
may be taken as indicative of his drinking, but standing by itself does not
show much.  Of more
concern are convictions in Inverell in 1966 for possession
of a firearm and discharging a firearm near a public street.  The evidence
discloses that the firearm was discharged not only near a public street but in
close proximity to his wife at a time when he was
affected by alcohol to a
significant degree.
<P>

31   	Upon sentence his Honour directed that the applicant be
returned to the prison hospital where he was being kept at the time
because of
his suicide tendencies. In December 1990 he was transferred to Lithgow
Correctional Centre with an A2 classification.
 On 4 March 1996 he was
transferred to Bathurst Correctional Centre where he remains with a B
classification. He has no misconduct
whatsoever recorded on his prison file and
has been a model prisoner, consistently receiving good reports and has
excellent work
records.  He has completed a number of courses whilst in
custody. He has had psychological counselling on a more or less regular
basis
and has attended a number of D and A courses.
<P>

32   	I do not intend to go through the various reports from the
Serious Offenders Review Board except to say that they are all
good reports and
clearly the description of the applicant as a model prisoner is justified.
<P>

33   	The Serious Offenders Review Council also reports that if
the sentence is redetermined it will develop a plan for his management
during
the remainder of any minimum term, and hopefully he will be progressively
reduced in security during his imprisonment in preparation
for his eventual
return to the community.
<P>

34   	One matter that has been of concern is that in 1991,
shortly after his conviction, he wrote a letter to his wife blaming her
and his
stepdaughter, Sheryn, for his problem and stating that he hoped all the hate
was out of his system before he got out and
went on: 
<P>

"Maybe one day you and her will pay for what you have done to me."
<P>

There was also evidence of reports by police of other threats that they had
heard around the town of Inverell.  This latter evidence
was objected to and I
rejected it as the sources of the rumours were not identified.
<P>

35   	He now says that whatever his feelings were then he does
not bear any ill will towards his former wife or children.  He has
had no
contact with them since he has been in gaol and does not intend to seek them
out if and when released.
<P>

36   	He also conceded in evidence that he had been violent
towards his ex-wife during the course of the marriage.  He said he does
not
know where his ex-wife and the children live, but he feels sorry for the hurt
he has caused them and he has no intention of having
anything to do with them.
He maintains contact with one brother and a sister.  He further stated he did
not think there would be
a chance in the world that he would ever reoffend, and
no way he would ever touch alcohol again.
<P>

37   	Dr Jolly in his report expressed the view that the
applicant seems to now accept full and proper responsibility for his actions
and he carries a classical burden of guilt as well as having major health
problems.  He did not regard him as a threat or risk to
members of his family.
He reaffirmed this view in his oral evidence and said that he did not consider
the applicant was likely to
offend again and gave as his reasons for that
opinion: (a) that he now genuinely believes that he did kill his son; (b) his
physical
health is such that he cannot move quickly and people with emphysema,
are not generally aggressive, and; (c) there is nothing in
his conduct which
would indicate a tendency to that sort of conduct.
<P>

38   	I accept Dr Jolly's opinion in that regard and am
satisfied that there is only a very slight risk of him reoffending, and
virtually no risk of him reoffending if he can keep away from the alcohol.  He
is determined to keep away from alcohol, but that
may be easier said than done
when he is ultimately released into the community.
<P>

39   	He is aged 55, been in custody for ten years and in view
of his condition is unlikely to be able to work when he is released.
 In my
view, the fact that the victim was his son aggravated the offence, particularly
as no motive has ever been disclosed, and
the applicant still says he does not
know why he did it.  On the other hand, his age, ill health and his excellent
record whilst
in custody are subjective features in his favour, and I have
taken them all into account.
<P>

40   	Norman Howard Wilson, for the murder of your son Dean
Edward Wilson I re-sentence you to penal servitude for a minimum term
of 15
years which shall be deemed to have commenced on 6 September 1989.  I fix an
additional term of 5 years.  The earliest date
on which you will be eligible to
be released on parole will be 5 September 2004.
