<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  <u>The Proceedings</u>:  By further amended summons
filed 20 June 1997 Miodrag Djordjevic, the plaintiff, claims, in effect, to be
entitled to recover from
Aleksandar Djordjevic, the first defendant, his son,
an amount of $120,000 paid by the plaintiff to the first defendant by way of
two payments by cheque, namely, a first payment of $50,000, being part of a
payment by cheque of $57,000, and a second, later, payment
by cheque of
$70,000.
<P>

2  	The further amended summons claims a declaration that the first
defendant holds the amount of $120,000 standing to the credit
of the first
defendant's account with Advance Bank Australia Limited, the second defendant,
and known as IBD Account No. 337.025115
upon trust for the plaintiff, and
further, and in the alternative, a declaration that that amount in that account
is the property
of the plaintiff.  Further, and in the alternative, the further
amended summons claims a declaration that the first defendant holds
the amount
of $120,000 upon trust for the plaintiff.
<P>

3  	The alleged factual basis for the plaintiff's claim is that the
plaintiff paid the said moneys to the first defendant to enable
the first
defendant to bid at auction on behalf of the plaintiff, and to pay, on behalf
of the plaintiff, a deposit in respect of
the purchase by the plaintiff of any
property in respect of which the first defendant was the successful bidder on
behalf of the
plaintiff, pursuant to arrangements made between the plaintiff
and the first defendant, during the time when the plaintiff was, or
was
anticipated to be, away from Australia and in Yugoslavia.  In the events which
happened, the first defendant did not make any
bid at any auction on behalf of
the plaintiff and, accordingly, no occasion arose for the payment of any
deposit by the first defendant
on behalf of the plaintiff.
<P>

4  	Counsel for the plaintiff in the "Short Outline of Submissions"
filed on behalf of the plaintiff submitted that the resolution
of the issues in
the proceedings involved "an interplay of two equitable principles" being "the
presumption of a resulting trust
in favour of the plaintiff as the source of
the $120,000 deposited in the IBI) Account where the plaintiff's son, the first
defendant,
holds the $120,000 on trust for the plaintiff" and the
"countervailing presumption of advancement to the plaintiff's son".
<P>

5  	In my opinion, however, the resolution of the present proceedings
does not depend upon the interplay of any presumptions because,
in my opinion,
the evidence is sufficiently detailed and clear to enable the Court to
determine the actual intention of the parties
which, of course, displaces any
presumptions which might otherwise be applicable.
<P>

6  	Although not embodied in any formal "defence" document, the
affidavits filed on behalf of the first defendant make it clear
that the first
defendant resists the claims of the plaintiff upon the basis that the first
payment to him by the plaintiff of $50,000
(part of the sum of $57,000) was a
payment by way of gift from the plaintiff to the first defendant to enable the
first defendant
to pay a deposit in respect of the purchase by him of a home
unit to be selected by him, whilst the payment by the plaintiff to the
first
defendant of the further sum of $70,000 was a payment by way of gift from the
plaintiff to the first defendant to enable the
first defendant to pay the
balance of purchase money in respect of a home unit to be purchased by him, to
the intent that the total
sum of $120,000 given by the plaintiff to the first
defendant would be used by the first defendant to pay the purchase price in
full
of a home unit to be purchased by the first defendant.
<P>

<u>The Facts: </u>
<P>

7  	The "Short Outline of Submissions" filed on behalf of the
plaintiff sets out certain "Facts in Brief' which it would appear
are not in
dispute.  Those "Facts in Brief" as set out in the "Short Outline of
Submissions" are as follows:-
<P>

<i>"1.	On 31 July 1996 the Plaintiff became entitled to receive a retirement
package of approximately $356,000.  That amount was paid
by the Plaintiff's
former employer, IBM Australia Limited, in three instalments, namely:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	$70,789.42 on 1 August 1996;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	$226,193.92 on 12 August 1996; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	$60, 000 on 14 November 1996.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The payments referred to above were deposited into the Plaintiff's bank
account with Intech Credit Union.  After the deposit of
the $226,193.92 on 12
August 1996 the following events occurred:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	on 13 August 1996 the Plaintiff drew a cheque in the amount of $57,000
to his son Aleksandar, the first Defendant in these proceedings;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	on 14 August 1996 the Plaintiff's son opened an IBD Account number
337025115 with the Advance Bank Australia Limited, the Second
Defendant in
these proceedings (the `IBD Account');</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	on 14 August 1996 the Plaintiff's son deposited the $57,000 cheque from
the Plaintiff into the IBD Account;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	in early September 1996 the Plaintiff made out another cheque to his son
in the amount of $70,000 which was deposited by the Plaintiff's
son into the
IBD Account on 13 September 1996;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	on 14 October 1996 the Plaintiff deposited $60,000 into the IBD Account
and on the same date became a signatory to the IBD Account;</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	on 11 November 1996, the Plaintiff's son cancelled the Plaintiff's
authority to operate the IBD Account;</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	on 14 November 1996 the Plaintiff's son withdrew $60,000 from the IBD
Account and gave a cheque for this amount to the Plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	the Plaintiff's son purported to retain the balance of $120,000 in the
IBD Account and refused to return the money to the Plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	on 22 November 1996 this Honourable Court made interim orders
restraining the Plaintiff's son and the Second Defendant from dealing
with the
IBD Account until further order.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	The cheques drawn in favour of the Plaintiff's son of $57,000 and $70,000
were drawn on the Plaintiff's bank account with Intech
Credit Union Limited.
The S60,000 deposited by the Plaintiff with IBD Account on 14 October 1996 was
also drawn on the Plaintiff's
bank account with Intech Credit Union Limited.
As the Plaintiff apprehends the evidence, the Plaintiff's son does not deny the
events
set out above in paragraphs 2(a)-() inclusive.</i>"
<P>

<u>The First Defendant's Evidence</u>
<P>

8  	In his affidavit sworn 27 November 1996 the first defendant,
whose evidence generally I accept, and whose evidence was not,
relevantly,
shaken in cross-examination, stated that when the plaintiff handed him the
cheque for $57,000 on or about 13 August 1996,
the plaintiff said in the
Serbian language "I am giving you $50,000 to buy yourself a flat."
<P>

9  	In the same affidavit the first defendant gave evidence that he
and the plaintiff attended at the Advance Bank a few days later
and saw a loans
officer in relation to the first defendant obtaining a loan of $60,000 (which
would be required, in addition to the
gift of $50,000, for the purchase of a
unit by the first defendant).  The first defendant further stated in this
affidavit that "on
this occasion the loans officer said to my father words to
the effect. What are the conditions on the $50,000 which you gave your
son.
Does it have to be repaid?  My father replied 'No. It is absolutely a gift.  I
gave it to him so he could buy a flat.  I want
to help my son.&#180;"
<P>

10  	In this affidavit the first defendant also stated that the
plaintiff had been living with him since about May 1996 and that
when the
plaintiff moved in with the first defendant, the plaintiff said words to the
effect "Nada (meaning his third wife) has kicked
me out and I have no place to
live.  I am broke until my money comes through."
<P>

11  	The reference to money coming through was a reference to the
superannuation moneys payable at a future time to the plaintiff
from his former
employer, IBM.
<P>

12  	In the same affidavit the first defendant stated that he and his
father had been estranged for some years but that, in fact,
their formerly poor
relationship improved greatly after the plaintiff moved in.
<P>

13  	The first defendant also stated in this affidavit that, at this
time, he was a second year university student enrolled with
the University of
Newcastle studying for the degree of Bachelor of Commerce through the Central
Coast Campus of the University. 
At that time, as well as attending university
two or three days per week, he also had two other jobs, one at the D'Albora
Marina,
Rushcutters Bay, where he worked during university semester time about
two or three days per week, and about six days during university
vacations.  He
also worked at Arthur's Pizza in Oxford Street from about 6pm until about 2am
on either six or seven nights per week.
 Accordingly, he regularly worked in
excess of sixty hours per week at the two jobs mentioned above, as well as
attending university.
<P>

14  	The first defendant stated that after the plaintiff moved in
with him (in about May 1996) the plaintiff would frequently say
to him words to
the effect.  "You are such a hard worker, I am very proud of you" or 'I would
like you to not have to work so hard
and spend more time on university
work."
<P>

15  	The first defendant also stated in this affidavit that on
numerous occasions the plaintiff said words to him to the effect:
 "When I get
my money I am going to do something to help you.  I am going to give you some
money to help you buy a flat.  You are
such a hard worker and I am proud of
you."
<P>

16  	The first defendant also stated that the plaintiff also said
words to the effect "You are wasting money paying rent.  You are
just paying
off someone else's investment.  You should buy your own flat and pay it off.  I
will give you some money."
<P>

17  	The first defendant also stated in this affidavit that a week or
so after the visit to the Advance Bank the plaintiff said
to him words to the
effect 'I would like you not to have to work so hard.  If you have a loan to
pay off you will still be working
just as hard as you are now, so 1 will give
you an extra $70,000 so you can spend more time at university."
<P>

18  	Shortly after that the plaintiff handed the second defendant the
second cheque in the sum of $70,000.
<P>

19  	The first defendant also stated that during this period the
plaintiff and the first defendant had many discussions about the
first
defendant buying a flat, and about the type of cheap one bedroom bachelor unit
which the first defendant could get for $120,000.
  The first defendant stated
that in all of those conversations the plaintiff consistently said words such
as "The flat will be yours.
 The money is a gift.  I am proud of you for being
such a hard worker, but now you will not have to work so hard and you can
concentrate
on University."
<P>

20  	The first defendant also stated that the plaintiff spoke about
the first defendant's sister who had to return to Yugoslavia
because she was
experiencing certain problems in Australia.  According to the first defendant
the plaintiff said words to the effect
that the first defendant had helped his
sister.
<P>

21  	The first defendant also stated that he was present on a number
of occasions when the plaintiff was speaking to other persons
and heard the
plaintiff say words to the effect.  "I am buying my son a flat or "I have given
my son the money to buy a flat."
<P>

22  	In the same affidavit the first defendant stated that the
plaintiff went to Yugoslavia in 1996 for approximately two weeks
and that
following his return the plaintiff "began" to say to the first defendant words
to the effect:  It would be better if we
bought a flat together.  We should
look for a two bedroom flat and buy<b> </b>it together and live together."
<P>

23  	The plaintiff then said "I will put another $60,000 into the
Advance Bank."
<P>

24  	According to the first defendant, following that conversation
the plaintiff and the first defendant inspected a number of flats
but could not
find anything they could agree upon and they subsequently argued.  The first
defendant stated that he had now returned
the sum of $60,000 to the
plaintiff.
<P>

25  	In the same affidavit the first defendant denied various
conversations and facts alleged in the affidavit of the plaintiff
sworn 22
November 1996.
<P>

26  	In his further affidavit sworn 21 July 1998 the first defendant
stated that the circumstances in which the plaintiff left the
defendant's
rented unit on 25 November 1996 were that on that day the first defendant
returned home to find many items missing from
the lounge room including the
lounge suite, the video machine, paintings, a bookcase and books.  The
plaintiff was present and had
a trolley with him. The television was packed in
bubble paper as if awaiting transportation.  The plaintiff and the first
defendant
then had an argument and the first defendant called the police.  The
police subsequently attended by which time the plaintiff had
returned to the
premises and was at that time playing solitaire on the computer.  After
discussion, the police asked the first defendant
to produce the lease, which
the first defendant apparently did, after which the police told the plaintiff
to leave the premises.
 The plaintiff then left the premises.
<P>

27  	In the same affidavit the first defendant stated that no
properties were inspected by him or by him and the plaintiff until
after the
plaintiff had given the first defendant the cheque for $57,000 and after the
plaintiff and the first defendant had attended
upon the Advance Bank to inquire
about a loan.  The first defendant stated that at the time the plaintiff gave
him the cheque for
$57,000 the plaintiff said words to the effect "I've added
an extra $7,000 because you gave me $5,000 for the car and you've given
me
other money through the time I've been here, so I've added another $2,000 to
the $5,000."
<P>

28  	The first defendant also stated that at the time the plaintiff
gave the first defendant a cheque for $60,000 on 14 October
1996 the plaintiff
said words to the effect "I should take the money out of the Credit Union (the
plaintiffs account) and put it
in an interest-bearing deposit with the Advance
Bank because they have a better interest rate."
<P>

29  	The plaintiff then accompanied the first defendant to the
Advance Bank where the sum of $60,000 was deposited in the account
of the first
defendant with the Advance Bank at which time the plaintiff said to the first
defendant words to the effect "As my money
is going into this account, I should
have authority to operate that account."
<P>

30  	The first defendant also stated that at no time did the
plaintiff state to him that the purpose of depositing any moneys in
the Advance
Bank was to allow the first defendant to have access to funds during the
plaintiffs absence overseas.  The first defendant
stated that there was, at the
time the plaintiff went overseas, no particular property which was listed for
auction during the period
the plaintiff was anticipated to be absent from
Australia.
<P>

31  	The first defendant stated that he did cancel the plaintiffs
authority to operate the first defendant's Advance Bank account
on 11 November
1996 being the time at which the first defendant sought to withdraw the sum of
$60,000 to repay to the plaintiff.
 However, the first defendant was unable to
withdraw that amount on that day as the interest bearing deposit had not
matured, but
a few days later he arranged for a bank cheque for that amount to
be drawn in favour of the plaintiff which later that day he handed
to the
plaintiff.
<P>

32  	The first defendant also stated that in November 1996 the
plaintiff and the first defendant drove to Lane Cove and looked at
three
properties.  One property which was for sale at about $155,000 was small and
had only two bedrooms. The largest of those properties
had three to four
bedrooms.  On the way back from Lane Cove in the car the plaintiff said words
to the effect that he would like
to buy the larger unit and that "We'll have to
borrow money and, as I don't have any income and I'm too old, nobody will lend
me
the money.  We'll have to buy it in your name but we'll really buy it
together."
<P>

33  	The first defendant replied in words to the effect "But I don't
want to buy the property with you and I'm not going to put
my money into us
buying a property together."  The plaintiff said words to the effect 'Well I'm
going to sign the contract (for the
smaller unit) anyway."  The first defendant
replied with words to the effect "You can do what you want."  According to the
first
defendant the conversation became "more heated and the plaintiff said to
the first defendant words to the effect "I want my money
back."
<P>

34  	The following Monday morning, 11 November 1996, the plaintiff
went to the Advance Bank and cancelled the plaintiffs authority
to operate the
account and shortly afterwards gave the plaintiff a cheque for $60,000 in the
circumstances mentioned earlier.
<P>

35  	According to the first defendant, the first defendant
subsequently said to the plaintiff words to the effect "I have spoken
to V1ad's
father-in-law who is a lawyer, and he told me that if you gave me a gift,
you're not entitled to get it back."  The plaintiff
replied "You have to go
down to the (Surry Hills) police station.  I've been to see them.  They said
that if you don't go down by
6 o'clock they'll come tomorrow and arrest you."
The first defendant said "Why?"  The plaintiff said "Because you've stolen my
money."
<P>

36  	The first defendant went to the Surry Hills police station where
he was told by a police officer words to the effect "I was
here when your
father came in ... I heard your father being told that it was nothing to do
with the police.  It was a civil matter."
 I said words to the effect "What's
going to happen now?"  The police officer said "Nothing, go home."
<P>

37  	In evidence in chief reply the first defendant repeated in
substance the conversation which took place between the first defendant,
the
plaintiff and the Advance Bank loans officer as related by him in his
affidavits but with some elaboration.  The first defendant
said that he told
the loans officer that he had funds of $50,000 to pay for a deposit on a home
unit and asked what size loan could
he get on that basis.  The first defendant
said that he told the loans officer that he was looking for a one bedroom or
studio apartment
in the range of $120,000.  According to the first defendant
the loans officer said he could borrow $60,000 and gave certain details
as to
repayments in respect of terms for repayment of 10, 15 and 20 years.
<P>

38  	According to the first defendant the loans officer asked where
the first defendant got the $50,000 from to which the first
defendant replied
that it was a gift from his father and in respect of which the plaintiff said
that it did not have to be repaid.
 The Bank officer stated that he would need
a "gift letter" from the plaintiff whereupon the plaintiff said words to the
effect 'No
problem".  The first defendant said that he would be more
comfortable with a 15 year term and the bank officer gave the first defendant
printed figures for fortnightly and monthly payments as well as informing the
plaintiff and the first defendant of extra costs such
as valuation fees, stamp
duty, legal costs and the like.  The meeting concluded with the production by
the bank officer of the letter
dated 16 August 1996 containing a reference to
"gift letter from your father" in the customer's "to do" list.  The bank
officer said
that the parties should come back when they had found a unit
together with the names of the solicitors they intended to use and the
gift
letter from the plaintiff.
<P>

39  	The first defendant also confirmed that during a conversation at
the first defendant's rented unit at Centennial Park, before
the plaintiff
received his superannuation entitlement from IBM, the plaintiff said to the
first defendant words to the effect that
he (the first defendant) was working
too much and not concentrating on his studies enough, that he had been at uni
for too long and
should work less and concentrate more on his studies.  The
first defendant stated that the plaintiff said that he was proud with
how the
first defendant was dealing with life because he hadn't lived with his father
since he was sixteen years and had been on
his own, so that he was proud how
the first defendant had finished school and got into the university and that he
took care of his
(the first defendant's) sister when he (the plaintiff) refused
to do so, and that he (the plaintiff) had "done wrong" by the first
defendant
and his sister and that he now felt that he could help the first defendant out
to start off his life by purchasing a unit.
 According to the first defendant
the plaintiff also said that he (the first defendant) was paying too much rent,
that it was ridiculous
paying off someone else's investment and that he should
start paying off his own unit and that he (the plaintiff) would provide (the
first defendant) with a deposit for it.  To which the plaintiff replied in
words to the effect "Thank you, Dad, I would like that."
<P>

40  	Later the plaintiff told the first defendant that he was going
to give the first defendant $50,000 for a deposit to buy himself
a home unit.
The plaintiff in fact gave the first defendant a cheque for $57,000 as to which
the plaintiff said that $50,000 was
for the deposit on the purchase of a home
unit whilst the $7,000 was a repayment of an informal loan comprising $5,000
that was loaned
for a car and an extra $2,000 just as a repayment of nothing in
particular, but for giving him (the plaintiff) money on a number
of occasions
and providing him with rent free accommodation, and paying his bills in the
period until his superannuation entitlements
were received.
<P>

41  	The first defendant also gave evidence that on or about 9
November the plaintiff asked the first defendant to accompany him
to Lane Cove
to inspect some properties in the course of which they inspected a number of
units and during the course of the day
the plaintiff suggested that he and the
first defendant should purchase "the big unit' together saying 'We can buy a
big unit if
you obtain a loan and with the money that I have and you have we
can buy it together in your name but actually we will be buying
it together."
The plaintiff said that he couldn't obtain a loan because he was too old and
no-one would give him a loan at his age.
The first defendant refused, saying
that that was not was agreed and that the first defendant had money of his own
and was looking
for a unit in the Eastern Suburbs and did not wish to live with
the plaintiff or purchase a property with him.  The plaintiff said
that in that
case he was going to purchase another unit and was going to make an offer on
it.  The first defendant replied that the
plaintiff could do whatever he
wanted.  On the way back from Lane Cove the plaintiff was very upset because
the first defendant refused
to buy a unit with him and the plaintiff requested
the first defendant to pay him his money back.  The first defendant understood
this to be a reference to the $60,000 and indicated that he was agreeable, that
that amount, by implication, should be repaid.
<P>

42  	As stated earlier, in due course the first defendant gave the
plaintiff a cheque for $60,000, at which time the plaintiff said
"Right, where
is the other $120,000?"  That, according to the first defendant, was the first
time that it became apparent that the
plaintiff wanted the money back that he
had given to the first defendant.  The first defendant refused and there
followed the events
mentioned earlier in this judgment, including the visit by
the first defendant to the Surry Hills police station.  The first defendant
also repeated certain evidence earlier given and added certain further details
relating to his early life and his early relationship
with the plaintiff.
<P>

43  	The first defendant adhered to this further oral evidence given
by him in the course of cross-examination by the plaintiff.
 In the course of
that cross-examination reference was made to the Advance Bank customer's "to
do" list which is stated to have been
printed on 16 August 1996 at 11.57am.
This list includes, as stated above, an item "gift letter from your father".
<P>

44  	In further cross-examination relating to that item in the list
the first defendant gave evidence to the effect that in the
context of working
out the repayments on the contemplated loan of $60,000, the repayments were
such that the first defendant could
not stop working, by reason whereof the
plaintiff said, according to the first defendant, "No, no, I'll give you extra
money and
you will buy a flat for cash".
<P>

45  	I note in this connection that paragraph 12 of the affidavit of
the first defendant sworn on 27 November 1996 is in the following
terms:-
<P>

<i>"12.	A week or so after the occasion mentioned in paragraph 7 (the visit to
the Advance Bank), my father said to me words to the effect:
-</i>
<P>

<i>'I would like you not to have to work so hard.  If you have a loan to pay
off you will still be working just as hard as you are now,
so I will give you
an extra $70,000 so you can spend more time at university</i>.'
<P>

<i>Shortly after that he gave me the second cheque for $70,000."</i>
<P>

<u>Other Evidence</u>
<P>

46  	Rodney Yeomans, a fellow employee of the first defendant at the
D'Albora Marina at Rushcutters Bay, gave evidence, which I
accept, that on two
occasions the plaintiff came to the Marina office and in his (Mr. Yeomans)
presence had a conversation with the
first defendant about the purchase of a
unit.  He stated that he heard the plaintiff say words to the effect "The unit
that you wanted
I was ready to bid up to the limit that you decided, but the
bidding went past that price and you didn't get it."  The first defendant
said:
"I would have gone to the auction but I had to work here so I asked my father
to go to the auction on my behalf."
<P>

47  	Mr. Yeomans also stated that during the conversation he heard
the units described as "studio units in the Potts Point area",
and that he
further heard discussion to the effect that the studio unit would be solely for
the use of Alex (the first defendant).
 Mr. Yeomans also recalled hearing the
plaintiff discussing the purchase of other premises for his own (the plaintiff
s) occupation.
<P>

48  	Vladimir Vujovic, the proprietor of "Arthur's Pizza Shop" at
which the first defendant worked also gave evidence on behalf
of the first
defendant that the plaintiff often called into the pizza shop to see the first
defendant and that at least on one occasion
the plaintiff said to him (Mr.
Vujovic) "I am going to help Alex to make life easier for him not to work so
hard.  I am going to
buy him a flat."
<P>

49  	Mr. Vujovic also gave evidence to the effect that on an occasion
in 1996 he attended an auction conducted by Vantage Real Estate
with the
plaintiff in the course of which the plaintiff stated to him in the Serbian
language "I am buying a flat for my son."
<P>

50  	In cross-examination Mr. Vujovic agreed that the words spoken by
the plaintiff to him on this occasion in the Serbian language,
as set out in
the Serbian language in paragraph 4 of his affidavit did not mean that the
plaintiff's son would own the unit.  In
cross-examination, however, Mr. Vujovic
also gave evidence that the words used by the plaintiff in the Serbian language
as set out
in paragraph 4 of his affidavit did not exclude the possibility that
the son would own the unit, in other words, that the words used
by the first
plaintiff in the Serbian language as referred to in paragraph 4 did not mean
either that the first defendant would own
the property referred to nor did they
mean that the plaintiff's son would not own the property referred to.  Mr.
Vujovic gave evidence
to the same effect in relation to paragraph 3 of his
affidavit in respect of which he said the words spoken by the plaintiff to him
were spoken in the Serbian language.
<P>

51  	There was also tendered in evidence on behalf of the first
defendant a copy of a faxed letter dated August 7, 1998, addressed
to the
solicitor for the first defendant from Mr. Zoran Veljic, the former consul for
Yugoslavia in Australia.  That faxed letter
was in the following terms:-
<P>

<i>"TO: Mr. Terence JESSOP	FAX. 612-94819403</i>
<P>

<i>Dear Sir,</i>
<P>

<i>Referring to our telephone conversation regarding Mr. Miki Djordjevic and
his son Alex I may confirm that I resided with my family
in Sydney Australia
from March 1991 till May 1997.  We met Mr. Miki Djordjevic and Alex somewhere
in April or May 1991.  Our families
had frequent contacts since then and got
befriended.</i>
<P>

<i>Somewhere in 1995 Mr. Miki Djordjevic started to talk about his retirement.
He was considering different options how to spend money
he was expecting to get
on his retirement.  He was mentioning to buy some small farm out of Sydney area
and to start software consultancy
for small business, to establish a computer
selling company in Sydney, even to buy some restaurant business.  Among those
different
options, at some later stage </i><cite>he mentioned his intention to
buy a studio or an one-room apartment for his son Alex</cite><i>.  He told me
that they were contacting real estate agencies and spending a lot of time in
inspection of different apartments.</i>
<P>

<i>In the last year of our stay in Sydney we did not see much of Mr.
Djordjevic.  We heard from Alex that his father had changed his
mind and that
he no longer wanted to buy an apartment for him and that they were having
numerous quarrels and serious disputes.</i>
<P>

<i>Sincerely yours,</i>
<P>

<i>Zoran Veljic</i>
<P>

<i>(signed)</i>
<P>

<i>Belgrade, August 7, 1998"</i>
<P>

<i>(Underlining supplied).</i>
<P>

52  	The plaintiff was cross-examined in relation to this letter as
follows:-
<P>

<i>"Q. Are you saying that your son was just making up evidence that you had
said to the former Consul of Yugoslavia in New South Wales
words to the effect
that you were buying a property for your son?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Oh, true.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And if the consul of Yugoslavia said that also he would be</i>
<P>

<i>lying too?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is true.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would you have a look at this document I am showing you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you recognise who signed that document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Mr. Zoran Veljic.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is the person referred to as the former Consul of Yugoslavia in New
South Wales.  After looking at that document do you say
that gentleman has told
any lies in that document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, not at all.  Everything he says in here is true."</i>
<P>

53  	I can only assume, although the point was not made in this
connection by the plaintiff, who at this time was appearing on his
own behalf,
that the plaintiff would have said that the relevant sentence underlined in the
quote above should be read and understood
as meaning that he (the plaintiff)
intended to buy a studio or a one- room apartment for his son, Alex, to "live
in rent free".
<P>

54  	Nevertheless, the fact remains that, in my opinion, the relevant
sentence in the fax of August 7, 1998, cannot, on its fair
and true
construction bear any such meaning, without more.
<P>

<u>The Plaintiffs Evidence:</u>
<P>

55  	In his affidavit sworn 21 March 1997 the plaintiff gave evidence
that his superannuation entitlements as referred to above
were deposited by him
into his credit union account with the Intech Credit Union Limited.  He stated
that apart from occasional consultancy
opportunities his retirement package was
his only means of income.  His last consultancy was in approximately July 1996.
The plaintiff
stated that in about April 1995 he remarried and that his new
wife resided in Yugoslavia, and that he was currently awaiting determination
of
her application to migrate to Australia.
<P>

56  	The plaintiff stated that he wanted to balance his retirement
package between purchasing a suitable home for his new wife and
himself and
investing the remaining funds to produce an income by way of investing in
property for rental return or investing in
the business.  The plaintiff stated
that he considered purchasing a residential unit which would eventually house
himself and his
wife and her son and allow the first defendant to live in it
rent free with him in the meantime until his wife's immigration to
Australia.
<P>

57  	The plaintiff stated that from late July 1996 he inspected a
number of properties with potential to serve as a home for him
and his new wife
and her son or for the purpose of investment.  He planned to travel to
Yugoslavia in August 1996 and about that
time had inspected two properties
which were of particular interest to him, namely, a two-bedroom unit at Lane
Cove and a studio
apartment at Potts Point.  The plaintiff stated that "In
order not to lose the opportunity to bid for those properties" he said to
the
first defendant words to the effect "I will be away in Yugoslavia when the
Potts Point and Lane Cove properties come up for auction.
 You go to the
auction for me and bid for the properties.  You should try and purchase the
Lane Cove property.  If you can't then
try to purchase the Potts Point
property."  According to the plaintiff the first defendant agreed.
<P>

58  	In this connection the plaintiff stated that he attempted to
make the first defendant a signatory to his account at Intech
Credit Union but
that the Credit Union would not allow him to do so.  Accordingly, the plaintiff
drew a cheque in the sum of $57,000
in favour of the first defendant and that
when handing it to the first defendant said words to the following effect.
"Here is a cheque
for $57,000. $7,000 is the money that I owe you.  The balance
of $50,000 is for you to bid for me on the Lane Cove and Potts Point
properties.  I don't know how much you need but $50,000 should be enough to
leave a deposit."
<P>

59  	The plaintiff stated that the first defendant agreed and also
stated that<b> </b>the $7,000 referred to in the above conversation was made up
of loans totalling $6,000 that the first defendant had made to him and
$1,000
which the plaintiff gave the first defendant towards rent for the first two
months.
<P>

60  	The plaintiff stated that he did not go to Yugoslavia as planned
in August 1996 but postponed that trip until September 1996
to allow his
daughter, Milica, to travel with him to Yugoslavia during her school holidays.
Before he left for Yugoslavia on 4 September
1996 the plaintiff stated that the
first defendant said to him words to the following effect.  "I will continue to
look for properties
for you while you are away.  You should deposit the rest of
your money in the Advance Bank.  It is more convenient and the interest
rate is
much better than the Credit Union.  I will make arrangements for you to be a
signatory."
<P>

61  	According to the plaintiff it was for these reasons that in
early September 1996 he made out a cheque in favour of the first
defendant for
$70,000 "to allow Aleksandar access to my funds during my absence to purchase
any suitable property on my behalf."
 The plaintiff stated that he made out the
cheque for $70,000 because he kept approximately $124,000 in his Credit Union
account
to pay a debt owed by him to the Child Support Agency of approximately
$46,000 and to have sufficient funds, namely, $60,000, to
set up and
architectural and design business that he was then negotiating with an
architectural acquaintance, Rasim Ruzdic.
<P>

62  	The plaintiff stated that when he returned from Yugoslavia on 19
September 1996 the architectural and design business that
he was negotiating
"did not eventuate" and that "to take advantage of the better interest rates I
deposited a further $60,000 with
the Advance Bank."  The plaintiff also stated
that on or about 15 October 1996 he and the first defendant attended the
Advance Bank
and signed the necessary papers to make the plaintiff a signatory
on the Advance Bank account of the first defendant.
<P>

63  	According to the plaintiff in early November 1996 he inspected a
two-bedroom unit at Lane Cove which he deemed to be suitable
for himself, his
wife and her teenage son from a previous marriage and in which the first
defendant could live with him rent free
until he finished his studies or until
his new wife came to Australia.
<P>

64  	The plaintiff says that he then made an offer to purchase the
unit for $155,000. He stated that a short time after making that
offer he asked
the first defendant to inspect the property and give him the first defendant's
opinion of it.  The plaintiff stated
that on or about 9 November 1996 he and
the first defendant inspected the unit after which the first defendant said "I
don't think
it's a good purchase.  I don't think you should purchase it.  If
you did purchase it, what would happen to the rest of the money?"
 The
plaintiff replied "I will buy an investment property or invest in the business.
I need to have some income for my retirement."
<P>

65  	The first defendant said "What if you go bankrupt.  What will I
inherit?"  The plaintiff said "Whatever is left of my estate
you will inherit a
quarter share along with your other brothers and sisters."  According to the
plaintiff the first defendant did
not reply.
<P>

66  	The plaintiff stated that on 14 November 1996 he attended the
Advance Bank at Oxford Street and attempted to deposit the last
instalment of
his retirement moneys, namely, $60,000, and also to withdraw a sum of $25,000
which he "wanted to use ... for my trip
to Yugoslavia."  The plaintiff stated
that a bank employee informed him that he was unable to withdraw or deposit
moneys from this
account as he did not have the authority to do so.  Later that
day the plaintiff says that he spoke to the first defendant about
this
difficulty but that the first defendant made no comment and left the house.
Later that evening according to the plaintiff the
first defendant handed the
plaintiff a bank cheque for $60,000 in the plaintiffs favour and upon the
plaintiff asking "What is this
for?" the first defendant said that "That's all
you get."  The plaintiff said "What are you talking about?  The rest of the
money
is mine.  That money is not yours.  You have no right to deal with it
like this."  The first defendant said "I have legal advice
from my solicitor
who says you cannot prove it was not a gift.  I claim the money as my own and
you can't do anything about it."
 The plaintiff says that the first defendant
then said "I will go to the police and have you charged" to which the first
defendant
replied "Go to the police or to whoever you want.  Get nicked."  The
plaintiff replied I will give you until tomorrow, (15 November
1996) to return
the money."
<P>

67  	The plaintiff stated that on Monday, 18 November 1996 he went to
Surry Hills police station to make a complaint and was told
that if the first
defendant was charged for a criminal act he would be prosecuted even if he
decided to return the money to which
the plaintiff said "I don't want my son to
have a criminal record." The police officer then said to the plaintiff "I
advise you to
see a lawyer and take civil action."  The plaintiff further
stated that he saw the first defendant on a number of occasions after
that time
asking for his money but that each time the first defendant replied "Nick
off."
<P>

68  	In his affidavit of 8 May 1997 the plaintiff stated that
"Because Aleksandar worked hard in various jobs whilst studying for
his
University Degree, I wanted to make life easier for him and considered
purchasing a studio apartment or a one-bedroom apartment
as a long term
investment for me but to allow Aleksandar to occupy the studio free of rent
until he finished his University studies.
 This was an alternative to me
purchasing a two-bedroom apartment and allowing Aleksandar to live with me rent
free until my new
wife arrived from Yugoslavia."
<P>

69  	The plaintiff denied the evidence of Mr. Vujovic referred to
above and said that what he (the plaintiff) said to Mr. Vujovic
on the
occasions referred to by Mr. Vujovic were words to the following effect: "I
have found a couple of properties, either a one
bedroom or a studio apartment
which will give me a good rental return.  If I buy one of them I will leave
Aleksandar live there rent
free until he finishes his studies.  I want to make
life easier for Aleksandar.  He works so hard and studies at the same time."
<P>

70  	The plaintiff also denied the conversations in respect of which
Mr. Rodney Yeomans gave evidence as referred to above.
<P>

71  	By his affidavit of 10 July 1998 the plaintiff denied ever
giving his son a gift of $50,000 as alleged and stated that he never
said to
his son "I am giving you $50,000 to buy yourself a flat."  He also denied that
he ever gave his son a gift of $70,000 as
alleged.  He also denied various
conversations alleged by the first defendant to have taken place but stated
that he did have conversations
with his sons to the following effect.  "You are
a hard worker.  When I buy a two-bedroom flat I will let you live with me rent
free
until my wife arrives in Australia.  If I decide to invest in a
one-bedroom flat or studio I will let you live there rent free until
you finish
University."
<P>

72  	The plaintiff denied that he ever said to the first defendant
"The flat will be yours.  The money is a gift."  The plaintiff
also denied
saying to other persons "I am buying my son a flat" or "I have given my son the
money to buy a flat".  Various other
conversations and facts were also denied
by the plaintiff in this affidavit.
<P>

73  	By affidavit sworn 6 August 1998 the plaintiff denied various
conversations and facts alleged in the affidavit of the first
defendant sworn
21 July 1998 but also gave certain additional evidence.
<P>

74  	The plaintiff denied that he told his son "I'm giving you
$50,000 to buy yourself a flat."  The plaintiff also stated that
he was
mistaken in saying that he left for Yugoslavia on 4 September 1996 having
ascertained from his passport that he left for Yugoslavia
on 2 September 1996.
The plaintiff also stated that it was the first defendant who initiated the
conversation about interest rates
stating "My interest rates are better than
yours, why don't we put all the money there?"  The plaintiff also stated that
prior to
becoming a signatory to the first defendant's account with the Advance
Bank he was told by telephone by a female employee of the
Intech Credit Union
that it was not possible to make the first defendant a signatory to the
plaintiff s account and that he would
need to open a new account for that
purpose.  
<P>

<u>Other Evidence</u>
<P>

75  	Rasim Ruzdic, a friend of the plaintiff, gave evidence on the
plaintiff's behalf by affidavit in which he stated that in 1996
he had a number
of conversations with the plaintiff in which the plaintiff would often say
words to the following effect.  "I have
to buy a flat for me and with the money
left after buying a flat I want to invest so that I have an income in my
retirement."
<P>

76  	He also gave evidence that during the time that he had known the
plaintiff in Australia, the plaintiff had never mentioned
that he wanted to buy
a flat for his son or give him any money as a gift.
<P>

77  	Although Mr. Ruzdic was cross-examined, it does not appear that
it was put to him that his evidence in relation to what the
plaintiff said to
him as set out in Mr. Ruzdic's affidavit was not said.  However, even accepting
what Mr. Ruzdic said in respect
of these matters at face value, I am of the
opinion that they are not necessarily inconsistent with the first defendant's
version
of relevant facts which, as stated above, I generally accept.
<P>

78  	Both the plaintiff and the first defendant were cross-examined
at some length, and, in addition, the plaintiff personally cross-examined
the
defendant, the plaintiff not being legally represented at that time.  This gave
the Court an opportunity to evaluate the truthfulness
and reliability of these
witnesses in the context of all the circumstances of the case, including, of
course, the circumstances described
in the affidavit evidence.
<P>

79  	The first defendant was, in my opinion, on material issues, a
truthful and reliable witness and accordingly, in general, I
accept his
evidence, as stated above.  The answers given by the first defendant were in
the main, precisely, quietly and carefully
given and were in the main
consistent with the objective facts, and also, in my opinion, with the
probabilities.  His memory was,
in my opinion, generally good and even in
relation to questions, particular answers to which might well have been
favourable to the
plaintiff, the defendant was ready to say without hesitation
and in my opinion, truthfully, that he did not remember.
<P>

80  	In general, in my opinion, the evidence of the first defendant
was, as stated above, more consistent with the objective facts
and the
probabilities as well as being corroborated in material respects by other
witnesses and by the letter from Mr. Veljic.
<P>

81  	On the other hand, I formed the opinion that although the
plaintiff was articulate and his evidence, in general, plausible,
his memory of
what was said on various occasions was not good, as evidenced by his inability
to remember even the substance and effect
of the words said during various
conversations.  The plaintiff was far more comfortable whilst endeavouring to
put various interpretations
on various events without necessarily having a
precise memory as to what was said and what occurred, and often without any
real effort
to remember what actually did occur or what was actually said.  The
plaintiff's questions in cross-examination of the first defendant
also, in my
opinion, reflected these deficiencies.  In addition, many of the answers given
by the plaintiff in the course of cross-examination
were unsatisfactory and
unacceptable and/or inconsistent with other evidence or other answers given by
the plaintiff.  I have in
mind in particular, inter alia, the plaintiff's
evidence in effect denying that he informed the loans officer of the Advance
Bank
that the $50,000 he had given to the first defendant was a gift
(notwithstanding the reference in the customer's "to do" list contained
in the
letter from the Advance Bank dated 16 August 1996) and his evidence in
cross-examination attempting to explain inconsistencies
and inaccuracies in his
affidavits.
<P>

82  	In these circumstances I am unable to regard the plaintiff's
evidence as reliable on material issues in respect of which, as
stated above, I
prefer the evidence of the first defendant as being more reliable, having
regard in particular to his obviously better
memory of the relevant events and
conversations and events as reflected by the quiet, precise and careful manner
in which he gave
his answers, and by his willingness to readily admit that he
had no memory of certain events and conversations when that was the
case.  I
have also had regard, as stated above, to my view that the evidence of the
first defendant was more consistent with the
objective facts and with the
probabilities as well as being corroborated in material respects by other
witnesses as well as by the
letter from Mr. Veljic referred to above.
<P>

83  	Other unsatisfactory or unacceptable evidence given by the
plaintiff in cross-examination is dealt with in the following paragraphs.
<P>

84  	In the course of cross-examination when it was put to the
plaintiff that he had not put certain information in any affidavit
as to which
matter he was now giving evidence he replied:  "You see the way the affidavit
is made is that I tell the whole story
to my lawyers and then they decide what
to put in the affidavit, and if the story is too long they probably, you know,
whatever".
<P>

85  	I note that this approach was taken in relation to various
matters which were put to the first plaintiff in cross-examination
and, in
particular, as to matter in affidavits which, prima facie, gave rise to
inconsistencies.  I was not satisfied, however, that
this was the true
explanation for such inconsistencies, but it is plain that the plaintiff found
this approach a convenient formula
for dealing with various inconsistencies
which were put to him in the course of cross-examination and which it would
have been difficult
for him to deal with in any other way.
<P>

86  	By way of further example the defendant gave the following
answer in cross- examination: "... You asked me questions, very
in-depth
questions and I tried to explain all the details that were not covered by the
affidavit."
<P>

87  	The plaintiff gave evidence in cross-examination that in August
1996 he was serious enough about one unit in Lane Cove and
one in Potts Point
that his son might have to proceed to deal with the purchase in his absence,
the one in Lane Cove being a two
bedroom apartment and the one in Potts Point
being a studio.  He agreed that the studio was where his son would live for the
balance
of his university training so that it would be some years at least
before he would get any income from that property.  The plaintiff
said that
that was correct but he wanted to help his son.  He agreed that it would be
fair to say that in August of 1996 he was very
kindly disposed towards his son,
as he said, "very much".  As to the property the plaintiff was looking at at
Lane Cove he said the
first defendant was supposed to live in it with him until
the first defendant finished his university course because it was planned
that
his wife would come later so the first defendant could live with the plaintiff
until the first defendant finished his study.
 He said the auction was to take
place during the last week of August.
<P>

88  	The plaintiff agreed that he remembered going with the first
defendant to the Advance Bank on which occasion they saw a loans
officer who at
or near the conclusion of the meeting handed to the first defendant a bundle of
forms and documents.
<P>

89  	The plaintiff agreed that during the course of the conversation
between himself, the first defendant and the bank loans officer,
one of the
matters which the bank loans officer referred to was the "gift letter from your
father", meaning the plaintiff.  The plaintiff
agreed that a "gift letter from
your father" was discussed.  However, very shortly thereafter in the course of
cross-examination
when it was put to him that one of the persons present at the
conversation said that the plaintiff was making a gift of moneys to
his son to
be the deposit for the purchase, the plaintiff replied "That was not what was
said."  There followed questions and answers
as follows:-
<P>

<i>"Q.	One of you, your son or yourself, said to the loans officer something to
the effect that you had or would be making a gift to
your son of moneys to be a
deposit on a proposed purchase?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That was not (the) exact wording ...</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The discussion was about the amount of the deposit that is needed for the
different types of loans</i>.
<P>

<i>Q.	And what did you say?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't say anything.  We were talking about - they were talking about
different deposits for the different amounts of loans and
different conditions.
It was a lot of discussion going like that and then the loan officer asked him
about the amount of the deposit
and he said it could be $20,000, it could be
$50, 000, it could be $60, 000.  He said if you can make the different options
let us
find out what is the repayment and what is the interest rate and what is
the relation between interest rate and capital for those
different options, and
the loan officer then asked him 'Where is that $20,000 or $50,000 or $60,000
coming from, and he said, 'Oh
my father gave me that'.   And then </i><cite>the
loan officer turned to me and asked, 'Does he have to repay that to you?  'I
said, 'No.' </cite><i>And then the loan officer turned back to him and
continued the discussion about the conditions and they went through the whole
thing
and they worked out all the papers. </i><cite>That was the only word that
I said during the whole meeting.</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>When you used that word you were telling the loans
officer</cite><i> </i><cite>the truth?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And as at the time of that meeting you had put $50,000 in your
son's account hadn't you?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, that was after we put the money in the bank,
yes</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

(Underlining supplied).
<P>

90  	Later, the following questions and answers appear in the
cross-examination:-
<P>

<i>"Q.	In relation to the conversation you had with the loans officer, what was
it you said your son didn't have to repay?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	We went there to ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	No, what you said?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The reason I said that was ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>What was it that he wasn't going to have to repay?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>The gift, the gift.  The loan officer asked me, `Does he have
to repay you a gift?' and I said `No'.</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>What gift?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>There was no gift, that's the point ...</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>So did you tell the loans officer that there was no
gift</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I didn't</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>But you let the loan officer think there was a
gift</cite><i>.?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That's correct</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you just deceived the loans officer?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>But you let the loan officer think there was a gift?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That's correct</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you just deceived the loans officer?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You were quite prepared to let him think there was a
gift</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I did</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You knew he understood that</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And you say that was a wrong impression</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes it was</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And you were prepared to let him have that wrong
impression?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes. The whole visit to the loan officer was the wrong
impression.  We did not want to take the loan at all.</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	I suggest to you that at that stage there was an intention to take a
loan?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it was the fact gathering mission.  We wanted to find out what was
the best offer we could get on the market, and ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You had heard your son in the meeting say that you had provided
to him a gift to be a deposit on the property, didn't you?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, he didn't say that</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Nothing like that</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Nothing</cite><i>.  He said -</i><cite> the loan officer asked
him about the</cite><i> </i><cite>origin of that money.</cite><i>  I mean he
said that the deposit that you want to make, is that a loan, and because if it
was the loan he would have to repay that
and then the loan officer would have
to assess the whole situation differently, you know, and</i><cite> he said,
'No, my father gave it to me.'</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And you knew the 'it' he was referring to was the
$50,000?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, we were talking about deposit of $20,000,
$50,000</cite><i>, </i><cite>$60,000, different values of properties, you know,
different ..."</cite><i> </i>(Underlining supplied).
<P>

91  	In relation to this part of the cross-examination of the
plaintiff I am of the opinion that the plaintiff was endeavouring
to give an
explanation as to the $50,000 to rebut any suggestion that it was said by the
first defendant at this meeting with the
loans officer that the $50,000 was a
gift to the first defendant from the plaintiff which did not have to be repaid.
I do not accept
this attempted explanation which, in my opinion, the plaintiff
invented when he realised the significance of what he had said earlier
to the
effect that the plaintiff informed the loan officer that the first defendant
did not have to repay the gift of $50,000 which
was to be used by way of
deposit.
<P>

92  	In the final analysis it is my opinion that the probabilities
strongly favour the view that the plaintiff did inform the loans
officer that
the first defendant did not have to repay the sum of $50,000, this sum having
been the subject of a gift by the plaintiff
to the first defendant, and that
this was in accordance with the actual fact.
<P>

93  	In the course of cross-examination of the plaintiff, in relation
to paragraph 11 of his affidavit sworn 22 November 1996, it
was put to the
plaintiff that that paragraph was misleading in that it plainly conveyed that
the plaintiff intended to be overseas
at a particular time during which it was
intended that the first defendant would attend an auction including a two
bedroom unit at
Lane Cove and a studio apartment at Potts Point which the first
defendant was to try to secure in the alternative on behalf of the
plaintiff,
that the first defendant attended such auction while the plaintiff was away but
he (the first defendant) "was unsuccessful
in acquiring either property",
whereas the true facts were that the plaintiff was not absent from Australia at
that time and attended
the auction himself.
<P>

94  	When asked in cross-examination why the plaintiff said what he
said in paragraph 11 the plaintiff replied as follows:-
<P>

<i>"A.	As I explained, I don't know, it just came to my attention.  The way the
affidavits were prepared was that you know, I tell the
whole story to the
solicitor, then they sit and put together in the form that is acceptable by the
Court, and then I just go, take
the points and sign it, and it must be an
admission that I made at the time.  </i><cite>It is the first time that it has
come to my attention, but that sentence is wrong, that is not true, that is
probably a misunderstanding
by Mr. Bilinsky, my solicitor who made (the)
affidavit</cite><i>.  It is not the case 1 was not successful because the price
went over the limit, but just to clarify it further it was never the
situation,
when Alex bidded on my behalf at the auction. ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	He (the first defendant) never bid on your behalf at any auction?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Never ...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you would agree that Mr. Bilinsky who drew this affidavit, would only
know when and when you weren't in Australia if you told
him so.  You cannot
blame Mr. Bilinsky?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am not blaming Mr. Bilinsky at all, it is an omission, I am very sorry
that happened, that sentence is wrong.  If he applies
with an, it is right,
then the whole of the paragraph is right.</i>
<P>

<i>HIS HONOUR:  That is not right, if he just made that change and left
everything else the paragraph is still not right.  According
to your present
evidence, it is the first sentence that says, 'My intention is to enable my son
during my absence to effect a purchase?'</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is right, I was planning to go away on a trip in mid-August and
because it was only a couple of weeks after I got the money,
and actually I got
the first money at the beginning of the second part, a bit later at the end of
the first week, so we had only
a week's time to do that, it was a pretty hectic
time and I was preparing everything, because I was in a hurry to do two things,
one to provide what I had to provide in Australia, and the other in my mind was
about my wife migrating, to have to go there and
assist her because she was in
a bit of a panic, and my intention was to go around and see as many properties
as possible, to make
some decisions too, not only about the properties, but to
buy the property as an investment at all or to do something else.  Another
decision that had to be made was to buy the property with cash and use that as
the equity, to do something else or to buy the apartment
for myself with the
cash and then use that as the equity for a mortgage for buying a property, it
all depend.  I am not an expert
in that, but Alex was explaining all the
details to me, because there are different taxation implications this, those
things, all
those things had to be taken into consideration.  Then there were a
couple of properties that were on the market that were very interesting
investment-wise and that was, one property was for the living, the two-bedroom
apartment was for the purpose of my own living in
it, the one-bedroom studio
was always for the investment, and in this case I was interested in both
properties and the intention
was to allow him to go and buy them while I am
abroad because it was a good opportunity, the price was good.  In the meantime
things
happened and I had to postpone my trip for a couple of weeks, so what
happened is that he didn't go to bid, I went.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>This paragraph 11 was sworn to you by you after all
those</cite><i> </i><cite>things had happened?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, definitely</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>In order for paragraph 11 to be correct it would have to
say</cite><i>, </i><cite>'My original intention was to enable my son during my
absence to effect a purchase, but as it turned out I postponed my trip and was
able to attend the auction myself.'</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, that is the additional information</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>It says nothing like that</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, it doesn't, but it doesn't exclude that as well.</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Of course it excludes it, it is quite misleading I
would</cite><i> </i><cite>suggest to you, in the light of what you now say were
the actual facts, what do you say about that?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>The only thing I can say is that, you know, I don't write
the</cite><i> </i><cite>affidavit myself I tell the whole story, then that
story is probably five times longer than the material that is in the affidavit.
That story is condensed, and put in the form that is appropriate for
affidavits</cite><i>.  I don't know how to put the affidavit, and then I read
that, and I say, 'Yeah, that is okay.'  There are other things, but you
know,
there is probably another occasion to talk about that we were talking about
many things that weren't mentioned in the affidavit.
 If we go word by word
we'll probably find a lot more examples of things, of not being said in
affidavits than things being said
in affidavits, because the story is rather
more complex than you can put in a couple of sentences to be able to be quickly
read in
Court.  </i><cite>So whatever is in the affidavits is pretty well true
as far as I can see.  There is this bad omission here, this omission is
probably
misunderstanding or to check every single word, signing it, these
things just happen."</cite> (Underlining supplied).
<P>

95  	I also find this answer unacceptable insofar as it indicates a
failure on the part of the witness (deponent) to properly read
his affidavits
so as to ensure that they do not convey facts other than the true facts.  The
unacceptability of the plaintiff's approach
to this matter was compounded, in
my opinion, in the following questions and answers to counsel for the
defendant:-
<P>

<i>Q.	In any event, whatever explanation there may be, would you now agree, it
is misleading, paragraph 11?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It doesn't look misleading to me, because I know exactly what is behind
it, and it is difficult for me to put myself aside, I mean,
you know, to
imagine myself as an impartial observer and say 'Yeah if you take that word,
that means that, and that means that you
can interpret the words differently.
I don't know what to answer to that question, it does not look to me.'</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You still don't see it as misleading?</i>
<P>

<i>A.		No, I think it is true, so it cannot be misleading if it's true."</i>
<P>

96  	In cross-examination the plaintiff agreed that according to the
plaintiff, the first two cheques were paid in anticipation
of a purchase having
to occur whilst the plaintiff was away although in point of fact there were no
properties that he had in mind
when he went away on 2 September.
<P>

97  	The plaintiff also gave evidence in cross-examination that he
wanted the first defendant to be a signatory to his account with
the Intech
Credit Union so that the first defendant could make purchases on behalf of the
plaintiff while the plaintiff was overseas,
but was unable to achieve that
result.
<P>

98  	There was, however, ample evidence to the effect that this could
have been done and the plaintiffs evidence that it could not
be done and the
reasons why it could not be done is unacceptable and inconsistent with the
evidence of Mr. Piccles, an officer of
the Intech Credit Union, who made an
affidavit on behalf of the first defendant and was cross-examined by the
plaintiff, which cross-examination
did not, in my opinion, shake Mr. Piccles'
evidence in any way.
<P>

<u>Conclusion. </u>
<P>

99  	In the final analysis, accepting as I do, as I have said, for
the reasons referred to above, the evidence of the first defendant,
and of the
witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the first defendant, in preference to
the evidence of the plaintiff, whose evidence
I am unable to accept in respect
of the principal issues in these proceedings, I am of the opinion that the
plaintiff, out of feelings
of genuine paternal generosity, gave, by way of
gift, a total of $120,000 to his son, the first defendant, by means of the two
payments
described above, for the purpose of enabling the first defendant to
purchase for himself a home unit to that approximate value. 
The purpose of the
gift was to relieve the first defendant of the necessity to work long hours (so
as to be able to pay rent and
otherwise support himself) so that the first
defendant could devote more time to his university studies.  In my opinion,
those gifts
were made at times when the plaintiff was living with the first
defendant in his rented unit and was well disposed to him.
<P>

100  	I am further of the opinion that, subsequent to the making of
these gifts, the plaintiff came to realise that the remaining
balance of his
superannuation moneys, after payment of these amounts and certain other
amounts, would be less than sufficient to
provide for the plaintiff's needs,
which the plaintiff saw as requiring the purchase of a unit in which to live
with his wife who
was to come from Yugoslavia to join him in Australia, as well
as the purchase of another income producing property by way of investment.
<P>

101  	In my opinion, this realisation came not later than the time
when the plaintiff decided that he wished to purchase a home
unit in Lane Cove
for which he did not have sufficient money, and would not, having regard to his
age, be able to borrow moneys to
fund the purchase.  At that time the plaintiff
asked the first defendant to join with him in purchasing the Lane Cove unit and
to
live in the Lane Cove unit with him, at least temporarily, using the money
of the first defendant which had been given to him by
the plaintiff.  In my
opinion, when the first defendant refused to do so in no uncertain terms, the
plaintiff sought to revoke his
gifts to the first defendant by demanding that
the moneys given by the plaintiff to the first defendant be repaid to the
plaintiff.
 This the first defendant refused to do after taking informal legal
advice, following which, after the return of the $60,000 referred
to above, not
being part of the $120,000 gift by the plaintiff to the first defendant, there
was the acrimonious parting of the ways
described above.
<P>

102  	Thereafter, in my opinion, the plaintiff attempted to justify
the two payments by him to the first defendant, by claiming,
contrary to the
fact, that those payments had been made to the first defendant for the purpose
of enabling the first defendant to
bid on behalf of the plaintiff for
properties at auctions which were to take place whilst the plaintiff was away
from Australia,
and also by claiming, contrary to the fact, that statements
that he had made to others to the effect that he was going to purchase
a unit
for the first defendant, should be understood as meaning no more than that the
plaintiff was intending to purchase a unit
in his own name, in which the first
defendant could live rent free for a limited time until he had completed his
university studies.
<P>

103  	It follows, in my opinion, and I so find, that each of the
relevant two cheques was delivered by the plaintiff to the first
defendant with
the intention that they would be gifts by the plaintiff to the first defendant.
There being no issue that the cheques
were paid, it also follows, and I also so
find, that each of the two gifts totalling $120,000 was complete and that the
plaintiff
is not entitled to claim repayment of any part of that sum: cf.
<b><i>In Re Swinburne; Sutton v Featherley</i></b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281926%29%201%20Ch%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1926) 1 Ch 38.</a>
<P>

<u>Order</u>
<P>

104  	Accordingly, the order of the Court is that the existing
injunction be dissolved, that the proceedings be dismissed, and that
the
plaintiff pay the costs of the first and second defendants of the
proceedings.
