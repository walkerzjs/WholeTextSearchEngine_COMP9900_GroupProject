<b>JUDGMENT  (On claim for legal professional privilege in respect of documents
produced by Dr Dent - see T614)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff, by Notice of Motion filed in court today, applies
to the Court for orders in relation to the inspection
of material produced by
Dr Malcolm Dent in answer to a subpoena for production issued by the defendant
on 23 March 1999. Some of
the material produced by Dr Dent has been the subject
of access to and inspection by the defendant.
<P>

2	The plaintiff has claimed privilege in respect to material contained in a
folder RWP 1, being a confidential exhibit to the affidavit
of Richard Williams
Potter, sworn 25 March 1999.
<P>

3	The circumstances giving rise to the issue of the subpoena, briefly, can be
summarised as follows; the plaintiff has made it abundantly
clear that in the
event of the defendant otherwise being entitled to amend its case on
justification, it should, nonetheless be precluded
from doing so by reason of
the severe psychiatric condition of the plaintiff being subject to substantial
damage by reason of what
is said to be the inevitable delay in the trial of his
action that would flow if leave be granted to the defendant, as a substantial
adjournment would be needed for the plaintiff to prepare his case in respect of
the additional material.
<P>

4	The present position is that Dr Dent is to give evidence on Tuesday of next
week on that component of the plaintiff's position
in the defendant's
application and, as I understand it, notice of the case on that issue, to be
constituted by the evidence of Dr
Dent, is comprised in the report dated 1
March 1999.  Also as I understand it, two other reports, one dated 18 May 1998
and one dated
8 September 1998, could be the subject of testimony.
<P>

5	Also, as I understand it, reports have been served by the defendant from Dr
White, particularly on November 1998, and as I understand
it Dr White will be
giving evidence on Tuesday.  The ambit of the claim for privilege is described
adequately in the affidavit of
Mr Potter, and particularly the schedule there
to which describes each document in the grey folder constituting confidential
exhibit
RWB 1, together with assertions of facts supporting the claim for
privilege in relation to the enumerated documents.
<P>

6	I have inspected the material in the folder in the light of what is asserted
by Mr Potter in the schedule to his affidavit and
have come to the view that
the bulk of it is presently protected by legal professional privilege.  I
should make it clear that that
view will continue until any development on
Tuesday, or otherwise, makes further consideration of that question desirable
or necessary.
<P>

7	However, with respect to the report dated 1 March 1998 I am satisfied that
there is material in the grey folder to which it cannot
be said any privilege
further attaches and by going through the documents by reference to their
numbers I will indicate those to
which the defendant should now have access and
the form, where necessary, in which access should be granted.
<P>

8	The last page of document 1 so much of it is as is constituted by handwritten
notes; document 3B in the edited form already produced
to the defendant; the
first page of document 6, and only so much of it as is constituted by the
handwritten notes there on, if practical,
generation of that document in that
form will be enough; and document 8 to which the defendant is also entitled
access.
<P>

9	I rule accordingly.
<P>
