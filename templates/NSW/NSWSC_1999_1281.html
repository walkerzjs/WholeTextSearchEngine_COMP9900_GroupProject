<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	This is an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)(b)(iii)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a> which provides as follows:
<P>

"Where:
<P>

(a) The proceeding (in this subs referred to as the  "relevant proceeding") is
pending in the Supreme Court ...
<P>

 
<P>

(b) it appears to the first court that
<P>

 
<P>

...
<P>

(iii) it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the relevant proceeding
be determined by the Supreme Court of another state
or of a territory
<P>

the first court shall transfer the relevant proceeding to that other Supreme
Court."
<P>

2   	The principal proceedings are constituted by a claim by the
plaintiff on behalf of herself and her two young children under
the Fatal
Accidents Act 1969 of Western Australia which, I am told, is in broadly
equivalent terms to the New South Wales Compensation
to Relatives Act.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff's claim arises from the death of her husband,
Howard Spence, on 21 March 1996 during the course of his employment.
 Mr Spence
was employed by a company then titled Freeze It Cryogenics Pty Ltd, which
company was engaged in work on a lengthy gas
pipeline in Western Australia.
Another employee, Andrew Legg, was injured in the accident that killed Mr
Spence.  As I understand
it, the death and injury were caused by a gas leak
involving liquid nitrogen.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff's proceedings are brought against four
corporate defendants.  It is unnecessary here to state the various bases
of the
claims, although the fact of the four defendants itself is of some significance
in the cross-vesting decision as will shortly
appear.
<P>

5   	Following Mr Spence's death a Coronial inquiry was
conducted in Western Australia.  The plaintiff was there represented by
Perth
based lawyers.  In addition, criminal prosecutions were brought against three
of the present defendants and one other defendant.
 Although the results of the
prosecutions are immaterial to the present decision, it may be noted for
completeness that only the
charge against AJ Lucas Pty Ltd resulted in
conviction.
<P>

6   	The judgment of the Magistrate who heard the prosecution
was placed before me and it is apparent that a considerable body of
evidence
was tendered.  Each defendant in that case was represented by Western
Australian lawyers  and the significance of this is
that those lawyers are
already very familiar with the relevant evidentiary material.  Mr Legg has
commenced proceedings, claiming
damages for personal injury arising out of the
accident, in the District Court of Western Australia.  Each of the present
defendants
is named as a defendant in his proceedings.
<P>

7   	I was advised that the defendants have filed cross-claims
against one another.  The issues of liability raised in Mr Legg's
proceedings
may be taken to be substantially identical to those that will be raised by or
on behalf of the plaintiff, although it
cannot be assumed that both will
conduct their cases in precisely the same manner.
<P>

8   	Certainly it may be assumed that the issues raised by the
litigation of the cross-claims will be identical, or very nearly
so.  I should
add that it may be assumed that, if it has not already happened, the defendants
in the present plaintiff's proceedings
will also file cross-claims against one
another.
<P>

9   	It may further be confidently assumed that both cases on
liability will involve the retention of expert witnesses.  Two such
experts who
gave evidence in the prosecutions are employed by the Western Australian
Department of Minerals and Energy, although
the nature of their expertise does
not appear to exhaust the issues that could be expected to arise in a claim of
the sort here under
consideration.
<P>

10   	The defendant/applicants adduced evidence in this
application that over one hundred boxes of relevant documents in relation
to
the pipeline project generally are in existence and are principally located in
Perth.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff on the other hand asserts that relevant
documentary material, also voluminous, is held in Sydney.
<P>

12   	I may say now that I put to one side any claim of
inconvenience in relation to or arising from the need to transport documents
from one jurisdiction to another.  In these technologically advanced times,
such considerations have all but disappeared.  Indeed
it was, I think, conceded
by both counsel that little weight ought to be given to this aspect of the
evidence.
<P>

13   	The defendants have identified 14 potential witnesses, six
of whom live in Western Australia.  Others live in various states
of Australia
and one in Italy.   Two only live in New South Wales.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff's evidence in resisting the application is
to the following effect:  she lives, and at all relevant times has
lived, with
her two young children aged 6 and 8 in Sydney.  She is unemployed and, should
the proceedings be heard in Western Australia,
it will be necessary for her to
travel with them to that state.  She will accordingly incur accommodation
expenses.  In this regard
I note that no evidence as to her financial position
or any resultant financial hardship was adduced.
<P>

15   	If the proceedings are heard during school term this will
result in the loss of schooling for the two children. She and her
husband at
all times lived in Sydney and all their financial records are held in Sydney.
She has  retained an accountant to investigate
and advise upon the
quantification of her claim in the event that she succeeds in establishing
liability.  All or most of the corporate
defendants have or had their
registered offices in Sydney.
<P>

16   	The defendants accept that the only order I can make under
the relevant statutory proceedings is one transferring the proceedings
to the
Supreme Court of Western Australia which would not have the effect of linking
the proceedings of those brought by Mr Legg,
those proceedings being at present
in the District Court. Recognising the impact of that fact on the weight of
their argument, they
have jointly undertaken to apply in Western Australia for
either the transfer of the plaintiff's proceedings to the District Court
should
they be successful in the present application, or for transfer of Mr Legg's
proceedings to the Supreme Court of that state.
 They have further undertaken
not to seek costs and in discussion I think the parties have agreed that the
order for costs that they
would urge the Western Australian court to make is
that the plaintiff's costs of that application be costs in the cause.
<P>

17   	Another matter that should be mentioned is that it is
agreed that the relevant law to be applied on all issues is that of
Western
Australia.  This is so, not only in relation to the question of liability and
damages, but also in the application of limitation
legislation, and this is
significant because the plaintiff has commenced her proceedings out of time
under Western Australia law
and will have to make an application for
extension.
<P>

18   	It was urged upon me on behalf of the plaintiff that there
is nothing unusual about this Court applying Western Australian
law and this is
undoubtedly so.
<P>

19   	Having regard to all of the matters put before me I have
concluded that the defendants have made out their case.  The factors
that lead
me to this conclusion are: 
<P>

1.  The claim itself has virtually no connection with New South Wales.  In
saying this I recognise that if the plaintiff succeeds
in establishing
liability, the quantification of damages will depend upon her establishing her
financial position and dependency
in New South Wales, but this is not a matter
of great difficulty and does not persuade me that this Court is the preferred
forum.
<P>

 
<P>

2.  The amount of relevant work already done by Western Australian based
lawyers, not only representing the defendants but also
representing the
plaintiff.  This is a matter of some significance.
<P>

 
<P>

3.  The application of Western Australian law.  While, as I said, the plaintiff
argued that this Court regularly applies the law
of other states it seems to
me, other things being equal, where that law is being applied it is better
applied by the courts of that
state.
<P>

 
<P>

4.  There is potential to avoid some of the duplication between the two sets of
proceedings if the liability claims, at least by
the plaintiff and Mr Legg, can
be united or coordinated in some way.  It may  be possible for that to be done
in Western Australia.
 It is not possible for that to be done if the
plaintiff's claim remains in New South Wales.
<P>

 
<P>

5.  The existence of the cross-claims.  These claims should, if possible, be
litigated together, not only to avoid duplication of
costs and court time but
also to avoid the undesirable potential for differing results in those
claims.
<P>

20   	Accordingly, I propose to make an order that the
proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Western Australia.
<P>

21   	Mr Kerr, you will have to bring in short minutes of order
to reflect that determination.  The costs are to be costs in the
cause and that
can be incorporated in the short minutes.
<P>
