<b><u>No.13148/92 - Seamez (Australia) Pty Limited &amp; Ors v Robert J
McLaughlin &amp; Anor</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiffs, Seamez (Australia) Pty Ltd ("Seamez"), Baden John Brown
("Brown")and Geraldine Freeman ("Freeman"), have commenced
proceedings against
the defendants, their former solicitors, Robert McLaughlin ("McLaughlin") and
Richard Buckley ("Buckley"), claiming
damages for breach of contract and breach
of fiduciary duty.  
<P>

2	I hope without disrespect, I will refer to all those involved by their
surnames.
<P>

3	The second and third plaintiffs, Brown and Freeman, are directors of Seamez,
a company which manufactures and sells cleaning chemicals.
<P>

4	The first and second defendants are partners in the law firm McLaughlin
O'Riordan, which acted for Seamez in proceedings it commenced
in the Federal
Court of Australia Ltd against United Systems (Holdings) Pty Limited ("United
Systems"), Ian John Barkley ("Barkley"),
Elizabeth Barkley and Umberdex Pty Ltd
(collectively "the respondents"), being proceedings No. G629 of 1990 ("the
Federal Court proceedings").
<P>

5	Prior to the Federal Court proceedings, in December 1986, United Systems had
commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court, Equity
Division, against Seamez,
Brown and Barkley ("the Equity proceedings").  In the Equity proceedings United
Systems sought an order
restraining Seamez, Brown and Barkley from
manufacturing, offering for sale or selling a product produced by Seamez known
as "Vanish"
and from dealing in any way with the formula and/or manufacturing
instructions for United System's product "MP 2000".  
<P>

6	United Systems alleged that Brown had stolen its formula and manufacturing
instructions for the product "MP2000" whilst he was
employed by a subsidiary
company of United Systems and that Seamez was using the formula and
manufacturing instructions to produce
Vanish.  Barkley was working for Seamez
at the time these proceedings were instituted.
<P>

7	Seamez's defence was that the formula they were using to produce Vanish was
obtained by them from wholesalers, Albright &amp;
Wilson, and was not owned or
developed by United Systems.
<P>

8	In the Federal Court proceedings, which were commenced on 5 November 1991,
Seamez alleged that their employee, Barkley, had stolen
the formulae and
primary data sheets for products developed by Brown, that the formulae were
trade secrets and that Seamez had copyright
in the primary data sheets, that
Barkley provided the formulae to United Systems and that United Systems had
produced and sold products
using those formulae.  The amended statement of
claim sought damages and/or an account of profits for breach of
confidentiality,
breach of copyright, misleading and deceptive conduct under
s42 of the <i>Fair Trading Act</i> and s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>
and breach by Barkley of a restraint of trade covenant in his employment
contract with Seamez.  
<P>

9	The Seamez products, the formulae to which had allegedly been stolen and used
by United Systems, were Heavy Duty Soap Gel, Industrial
Strength Barrier Cream,
Gleam, Emerald, Vitalize, Beer Line Cleaner 1 and 2 and Seamez Concentrate. 
<P>

10	United Systems' defence was that the formulae were not "confidential", being
formulae provided by wholesale suppliers and not
therefore owned by either
Seamez or United Systems, and/or that the formulae were developed by United
Systems and had been stolen
by Brown.
<P>

11	Initially, Stuart &amp; Mills, solicitors, acted on behalf of Seamez in the
Federal Court proceedings.  However, on 24 January
1991, Seamez retained
McLaughlin O'Riordan to act on its behalf.  McLaughlin was the partner with
carriage of the matter (although
from February 1991 until June 1991 an employed
solicitor, Fraser Doak, had day to day conduct of the matter).  Seamez did not
instruct
McLaughlin O'Riordan to act on its behalf in relation to the Equity
proceedings because United Systems was not pressing its claim.
<P>

12	On 5 November 1991, the Federal Court proceedings were fixed for a hearing
of 5-7 days commencing on Monday 23 March 1992 before
his Honour Justice
Sheppard.  The proceedings were to go to trial in the first instance on
liability only, with an account of profits
to be taken at a later time if the
plaintiffs were successful.  On the Friday before the date fixed for hearing,
20 March 1992, the
matter was settled on the basis of a payment by Seamez to
United Systems of $20,000.  The terms of settlement were contained in a
deed of
settlement ("the deed") executed on 20 March 1992 and filed in Court on 23
March 1992.  
<P>

	<b>The present proceedings</b>
<P>

13	In the week following the execution of the deed, Brown instructed Parbury
&amp; Associates to act on behalf of Seamez.  On 16
June 1992, the plaintiffs
commenced proceedings against the defendants by the filing of a statement of
claim.  At the hearing, the
plaintiffs relied on the case as pleaded in an
amended statement of claim filed on 24 July 1997.  In the amended statement of
claim
the plaintiffs sought damages for breach of contract and breach of
fiduciary duty.
<P>

14	Pursuant to an order made by consent on 25 September 1997 by Deputy
Registrar Haggett, determination of the quantum of damages
was postponed.  The
order was in terms of para 1 of a notice of motion dated 5 August 1997, which
was in the following terms:
<P>

	"That pursuant to Part 31 Rule 2 there be determined separately from all other
questions in the proceedings and after the determination
of all other questions
in the proceedings the question of the quantum of the damages, if any,
sustained by the Plaintiffs as a result
of such acts or omissions of the
defendants as may be proved to found any of the causes of action pleaded in the
amended statement
of claim".
<P>

15	On 13 November 1998, I noted counsels' agreement to the following
(Tr.319)-
<P>

	"1.	Issues to be tried are all the issues in the proceedings except the
quantification of damages for any loss or damage suffered
by the plaintiff;
<P>

	
<P>

	2.	The issues to be tried include any actions or events consequent upon any
breach of duty by the defendants;
<P>

	
<P>

	3.	The absence of quantification of damage is not to impede a finding of
breach of duty by the defendants (whether a duty of care,
contractual duty or
fiduciary duty); and
<P>

	
<P>

	4.	Deferral of the issue of quantum of damages does not imply an admission of
loss or damage by the defendants."
<P>

16	The main complaint in these proceedings relates to the defendants' advice on
settlement.  The plaintiffs allege that the settlement
of the Federal Court
proceedings, in effect, amounted to an abandonment of the proceedings and of
other rights, that they settled
in reliance upon negligent and misleading
advice given by McLaughlin, and that as a result they lost the benefit of the
Federal Court
proceedings.
<P>

17	The plaintiffs also claim that the defendants acted in breach of fiduciary
duty.  It is alleged that McLaughlin, due to inadequate
preparation, was not
ready to proceed with the hearing on the date fixed for the trial and that, by
persuading the plaintiffs to
settle on unfavourable terms, concealing that
situation and preferring his own interests to those of his clients.
<P>

18	In the amended statement of claim the plaintiffs seek damages for breach of
contract.  The terms of the contract which they submit
have been breached are
specified as follows:
<P>

	i.	A term and condition that the defendants would at all times advise the
plaintiffs with respect to the litigation and to keep
the plaintiffs fully and
frankly and accurately informed and advised concerning the prospects of success
in the litigation, whether
or not it should be settled or otherwise compromised
and in such case the terms upon which it should be settled or otherwise
compromised
- the plaintiffs argue that this is an express term of the contract
which was agreed to between Brown and McLaughlin in a conversation
they had on
24 January 1991; and
<P>

ii.	A term and condition that the defendants would, or alternatively it was the
duty of the defendants to exercise all reasonable
care skill, diligence and
competence as solicitors in the preparation, conduct and finalisation of the
said litigation and to take
all reasonable and proper care that the litigation
was, inter alia, concluded upon the basis of a skilful, diligent and competent
legal analysis of the respective and relative merits of the parties to the
litigation - this was said to be an implied term of the
agreement.
<P>

19	The defendants deny that these were terms of the contract between themselves
and the plaintiffs and deny that they breached any
such terms.  The defendants
deny that they breached any fiduciary duty.
<P>

20	Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted a schedule of the findings sought by
the plaintiffs as to the acts and omissions which allegedly
constituted breach
of contractual and fiduciary obligation.  The schedule was as follows:
<P>

	i.	Failing to obtain full and proper discovery from the respondents in the
litigation such that the applicants' case was not adequately
prepared on the
issue of documents held by the respondents regarding the chemical formulae of
their products and also regarding profits
made by them from sales of their
products.
<P>

	
<P>

	ii.	(Not pressed.)
<P>

	
<P>

	iii.	Advising the applicants that the litigation should be settled or
compromised only on 19 March 1992, one business day before

the hearing of the litigation or even on 18 March 1992, only two days before
the commencement.

<P>

	
<P>

	vii.	Failing to obtain the advice of counsel concerning the 1986 Equity

<P>

	
<P>

	viii.	Failing to inform the plaintiffs that leading counsel had returned his
brief until the evening of Thursday 19 March 1992
or alternatively on 18 March
1992.
<P>

	
<P>

	ix.	Failing to advise the plaintiffs adequately or at all of the consequences
and circumstances of leading counsel returning his

particularly that of Baden John Brown, prior to
the week before the

<P>

	
<P>

	xi.	Failing to properly obtain and consider the affidavit evidence of  Freeman

adjourn the hearing of the litigation by instructing
Jacobson or Brender of
counsel or by instructing other appropriate counsel.
<P>

	xiv.	Advising the applicants on 20 March 1992 that both their counsel were

to get an adjournment of the hearing of the litigation
and the applicants would
be forced on.
<P>

	
<P>

	xvi.	Failing to take any adequate steps to retain alternative counsel to
Jacobson during the period 18 March 1992 to 20 March 1992.
<P>

	
<P>

	xvii.	Placing the plaintiffs in a position on 20 March 1992 whereby the
plaintiffs had no alternative other than to settle the
litigation on very
disadvantageous terms.
<P>

	
<P>

	xviii.	Representing to the plaintiffs on 20 March 1992 that the respondents to
the litigation had taken out a Mareva injunction
against them and would serve

when to the knowledge
of McLaughlin the respondents had not done so and did not
ever intend to do so.
<P>

	
<P>

	xix.	Representing to the plaintiffs that Mr Robert Fulton had commenced
defamation proceedings against Mr Brown and that the process
for those

of the litigation on 23 March 1992 when
to the knowledge of McLaughlin Mr
Fulton had not done so.
<P>

	
<P>

that they would be required to pay $250,000 in cash
to the respondents by
9:30am on 23 March 1992, prior to the hearing of the litigation, when he had no
reasonable grounds for believing
that to be true.
<P>

	
<P>

	xxi.	(Not pressed).
<P>

<P>

against the respondents to protect their interests in their products.
<P>

	
<P>

	xxiv.	Failing to advise the plaintiffs that under the provisions of the deed

<P>

	
<P>

<P>

<P>

	
<P>

	xxvii.	During the period 17 March to 20 March 1992 failing to advise the
plaintiffs that the litigation was not fully or properly
prepared for
hearing.
<P>

	
<P>

	xxviii.	Failing to advise the plaintiffs as at 16 March 1992 that the
litigation was not ready for hearing as a result of the defendants'
breaches of
duty.
<P>

	
<P>

	xxix.	Advising the plaintiffs to compromise the litigation upon a payment to

of success in the
litigation were better than 50%.
<P>

21	Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted a further schedule, being the findings
sought as to the alleged consequences of such acts
and omissions (cross
referenced to the alleged acts and omissions relied on in each case).  The
second schedule was as follows:
<P>

 
<P>

1.	The plaintiffs would not have signed the deed of 20 March, 1992 to settle
the Federal Court proceedings (breaches ii, iii, xii,
xiii, xiv, xv, xvi, xvii,
xviii, xix, xx, xxi, xxii, xxiii, xxiv, xxvi and xxx)
<P>

2.	The plaintiffs would have continued to conduct the Federal Court proceedings
to judgment (breaches viii, ix, xii, xiii, xv, xvi,
xvii, xviii, xix, xx, xxi,
xxvii, xxviii, xxix and xxx).
<P>

3.	Alternatively to 2, the plaintiffs would have had an opportunity to consider
settlement of the Federal Court proceedings calmly,
in a timely manner, and
with the benefit of considered opinions of their solicitor and senior counsel
(all breaches and/or misrepresentations
alleged except xxii, xxiii, xxiv, xxv
and xxvi).
<P>

4.	The plaintiffs would not have settled the Federal Court proceedings on the
terms that they did (all breaches and/or misrepresentations
alleged).
<P>

5.	The plaintiffs would not have lost the opportunity to have their Federal
Court proceedings determined by a Judge of that Court
(all breaches and/or
misrepresentations alleged).
<P>

6.	Alternatively to 5, the plaintiffs would not have incurred the costs, or
alternatively a significant proportion of the costs,
of the Federal Court
proceedings (breaches ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, x, xi, xii and xiii).
<P>

7.	The plaintiffs would not have incurred the sum of $20,000.00, paid to the
respondents in the Federal Court proceedings (breaches
ii, iii, iv, viii, ix,
xii, xiii, xiv, xv, xvi, xvii, xviii, xix, xx, xxi, xxiii, xxiv, xxvi, xxix and
xxx).
<P>

8.	The plaintiffs would have instructed the defendants in definitive terms to
apply for an adjournment of the Federal Court proceedings
if they had known or
thought that there could be any doubt that their instructions to run the
Federal Court proceedings did not necessarily
include the making of all or any
applications to adjourn them (the Federal Court proceedings would have been
adjourned) (breaches
viii, ix, xii, xiii, xiv, xv, xvi, xvii, xviii, xix, xxi,
xxvii and xxviii).
<P>

9.	The plaintiffs would have had the opportunity overnight or over the weekend
further to reflect upon and to confer about the terms
of the deed of 20 March,
1992 before being required to decide whether or not to sign it (breaches iii,
xvii, xviii, xix, xx, xxi
and xxix).
<P>

10.	The plaintiffs would have instructed the defendants to take all such
further steps as were necessary or sufficient to complete
discovery in the
Federal Court proceedings in the ways referred to in McLaughlin's (unsent)
letter of 20 March, 1992 addressed to
the Solicitors for the Respondents in the
Federal Court proceedings (breaches i, v, x, xii, xxvii, xxviii and xxx).
<P>

11.	The plaintiffs would not have incurred the costs of the present litigation
(breaches ii, iv, xii, xiii, xvi, xvii, xviii, xix,
xx, xxii, xxiii, xxiv, xxix
and xxx).
<P>

	<b>The law</b>
<P>

22	The courts recognise that a solicitor is subject to a range of implied
obligations : <i>Midland Bank v Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch 384</a>;
<i>Hawkins v Clayton</i> (1988) 164 CLR 539, including the obligation to
exercise reasonable care and skill: <i>Nocton v Lord Ashburton</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%20AC%20932" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] AC
932</a>, 956; <i>Hawkins</i> (at 575); <i>Midland Bank v Hett, Stubbs &amp;
Kemp</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20Ch%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] Ch 384</a>; <i>Ashby v Russell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20ANZ%20ConvR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] ANZ ConvR 321</a>,322-3.  
<P>

23	The scope of the contractual duty of care will vary, depending upon the
terms and limits of the retainer; any duty of care must
relate to what the
solicitor is instructed to do: <i>Midland Bank </i>(at 402-403); <i>Hawkins
</i>(at 544 per Mason CJ and Wilson J).  
<P>

24	The courts have recognised that a solicitor's duty of care extends to
his/her explanation of the effect and import of legal documents
which fall
within the retainer : <i>Fox v Everingham</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1983/258.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] FCA 258</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2050%20ALR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 50 ALR 337</a>, 341;
<i>Charlick v Foley Bros Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1916/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1916] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281916%29%2021%20CLR%20249" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1916) 21 CLR 249</a>; <i>Golec v Scott</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20168" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
38 NSWLR 168</a>; <i>Krakowski v Trenorth Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d401" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) Aust Torts Reports
81-401.</a>
<P>

25	In the case of the defendants, they were retained to prepare and conduct the
Federal Court proceedings.  Such a retainer includes,
by implication, in my
view, an obligation to advise in relation to settlement of the proceedings.  In
any event, once a solicitor
assumes the role of adviser in relation to
settlement and the client accepts that role (as occurred in this case), there
is a consensual
extension of the retainer (if that be necessary) to include the
provision of such advice.  The contractual duty of care then attaches
to that
function.
<P>

26	Although the scope of the contractual duty of care varies from the duty of
care in tort, in that the contractual duty is limited
by the terms of the
retainer whereas the duty of care in tort is not (see <i>Hawkins</i> and
<i>Citicorp Australia Ltd v O'Brien</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 398</a>, 412-413), the
standard of care is the same in contract and tort.  In <i>Hawkins,</i> Deane J
said (at 583)-
<P>

	"The content of the solicitor's duty of skill and care under the contractual
term which has traditionally been implied corresponds
with the content of the
ordinary duty of skill and care under the common law of negligence: see eg,
<i>Central Trust Co. v Rafuse</i> (1986) 31 DLR (4th) at 525."
<P>

27	Thus, statements of principle concerning the standard of care owed by a
solicitor in tort are applicable to contract cases. 
The standard of care
imposed is that of an ordinary skilled and reasonably careful practitioner :

264.
<P>

29	A somewhat stricter approach has been adopted against plaintiffs in relation
to claims which pertain to the settlement of a case.
 The courts have taken the
view that because of the public policy interest in encouraging settlement of
disputes "only in a clear
and exceptional case...[can]...the decision of
counsel to recommend settlement...be successfully assailed": <i>Karpenko</i>
supra at 397 per Anderson J; also see <i>Studer v Boettcher</i> supra at 16;
<i>Campbell v Gibson &amp; </i>Gibson supra; <i>Maillet &amp; Pothier v
Haliburton &amp; Comeau</i> (1983) 114 APR 311, 315; <i>Atwell v Michael Perry

is given by a solicitor.  According to these decisions, a solicitor will only
be in
breach of duty in advising in favour of a settlement if the error alleged
to have been made is an egregious one and, in particular,
will not be liable
for "an error of judgment based on an honest opinion as to the facts or on
points of law of doubtful construction
or of new occurrence": <i>Campbell v
Gibson &amp; Gibson</i> supra at 264.  Young J in <i>Studer</i> (supra) at 16
quoted with approval the following passage from the decision in <i>Karpenko</i>
(at 387):
<P>

	"The courts do not interfere unless it can be seen that the view that the
barrister or solicitor took was such that no reasonable
solicitor or barrister
could have come to in the circumstances".
<P>

	
<P>

30	This line of authority relates to a solicitor's exercise of judgment in
advising settlement.  It does not relate to the provision
of information to the
client, known by or readily available to the solicitor, which is relevant to a
decision by the client concerning
settlement.  No such caution is required in
that regard.
<P>

31	In addition to being subject to implied contractual duties, the defendants
as solicitors were also subject to fiduciary obligations.
 Where a conflict
between the interests of the client and those of the solicitor arises,
solicitors must not prefer their own interests
to that of the client:

to that obligation.<i> </i>
<P>

	<b>The plaintiffs' evidence in the present proceedings</b>
<P>

32	The evidence relied upon by the plaintiffs consisted partly of documentary
evidence but primarily of the evidence of witnesses.
 The affidavits of the
main plaintiffs' witnesses were those of Baden John Brown, sworn 13 October
1997, Geraldine Freeman, sworn
13 October 1997 and Michael Anthony Coleman,
sworn 27 February 1997.  These witnesses were cross-examined.  (Coleman was a
mutual
friend of Brown and McLaughlin.)  He introduced the plaintiffs to
McLaughlin.  Other affidavits were read in the plaintiffs' case.
 They were not
relied on in final address.
<P>

33	The evidence as to how the affidavits of Brown, Freeman and Coleman came
into existence is as follows.  Brown claims that his
statement for the present
proceedings was completed by his solicitor, Mr Parbury, by late April 1992.  He
said that he gave his instructions
for the preparation of that statement partly
in oral form and partly in writing, and based on his own independent
recollection of
the events.  In cross-examination he said (at Tr.24) that he
provided to Mr Parbury, for the purpose of drafting his statement, some
typed
and long hand notes which set out his recollection of events.  These were in
evidence.  He also conceded in cross-examination
that he had discussed the case
often with Freeman and that he had discussed what had occurred at the meetings
which took place between
17 and 20 March 1992 with her.  He denied that, for
the purposes of preparing his statement, he had discussed in detail with
Freeman
what she recalled of those meetings.  He also denied that he discussed
these events with Coleman before preparing his affidavit.
 The earliest
affidavit by Brown filed in these proceedings was sworn on 3 March 1997.
<P>

34	Freeman claims that her statement was also completed by late April 1992.
She said that she did not provide any written or typed
notes to Mr Parbury, but
that she gave her instructions for the preparation of her statement to Mr
Parbury orally in conference with
him.  She also admitted in cross-examination
that she and Brown had discussed the events the subject of these proceedings on
numerous
occasions, but she claimed that her affidavit evidence was based
solely on her own independent recollection of events.  She denied
that she
discussed the events with either Brown or Coleman to assist her in the
preparation of her affidavit.  The earliest affidavit
by Freeman filed in these
proceedings was sworn on 3 March 1997.
<P>

35	Coleman claimed that he gave his instructions for the preparation of his
affidavit to Parbury orally in conference with him,
some time in mid-1994.  He
said that his instructions were based solely on his independent recollection of
events.  He denied that
he spoke to either Freeman or Brown about the events to
which he deposed before giving those instructions.  Coleman's draft statement
was prepared on 15 June 1994.  The draft statement was then amended, with
several additional passages being added, and, on 14 September
1994, the amended
statement was signed by Coleman.  The affidavit by Coleman ultimately relied
upon in these proceedings was sworn
by Coleman on 27 February 1997.
<P>

36	The defendants challenged this account of the way the plaintiffs' affidavit
evidence came into existence.  Having regard to a
high degree of similarity in
content, detail, terminology and sequence (particularly in relation to
conversations) between the affidavits
of the three witnesses, I am satisfied
that the affidavits cannot have come into existence without direct or indirect
collaboration.

<P>

37	The defendants' submission was that Brown's affidavit was prepared first,
with the use of the notes typed up by him and that
Freeman and Coleman's
affidavits were then prepared to accord with his affidavit.
<P>

38	My analysis is as follows.  I agree that Brown, Freeman and Coleman have
given such similar accounts, particularly of events
on 19 and 20 March 1992,
that they cannot all be original accounts given according to the respective
witness' genuine recollection.
 Either they are a joint collaboration or only
one is a genuine recollection of the detail of what occurred.  If one account
is truly
based on a genuine recollection of events, the other two are not.  
<P>

39	There is the further implication that, if one is genuine account, the other
two witnesses have given incorrect evidence as to
how their respective accounts
came into existence.  For example, if Brown or Freeman's account is genuine,
that account must have
come into existence before Coleman's.  Coleman's
evidence that he gave an independent account of events at a later time in such
similar
terms would then have to be rejected.  If, on the other hand, Coleman's
account is genuine and came into existence when he said it
did, Brown and
Freeman's evidence of having given independent accounts at an earlier time in
such similar terms would have to be
rejected.  I need not spell out how the
same implications arise as between any two of the three.
<P>

40	Accordingly, acceptance of one of the three accounts of the events on 19 and
20 March 1992 means not only that the other two
are not genuinely recollected,
independent accounts.  It also means that the authors of those other accounts
have misstated the way
in which their respective accounts came into existence,
and seriously so.  The credit of the others would then be worthless.
<P>

41	It is important to recognise that the similarities between the three
accounts does not imply that all three witnesses are discredited.
 One account
may be genuine.  That the other two were copied from that account - a necessary
implication - would not discredit it
at all.
<P>

42	Of the accounts by Brown, Freeman and Coleman it is much more likely that
Coleman's is an original and genuine account than that
Brown's or Freeman's is
an original and genuine account for the following reasons -
<P>

i.	Coleman was, relatively speaking, an independent witness.  He had known
Brown as a personal friend since the 1960s but he had
also known McLaughlin for
in excess of 20 years.  He had no personal interest in the outcome of the
Federal Court proceedings and
had none in the outcome of these proceedings.
<P>

ii.	As a barrister, it is very unlikely that he would allow an affidavit to be
written for him that was not his own genuine recollection,
or participate in
the process.  It is also unlikely that he would lie on oath about how his
affidavit came to be prepared.  I say
this because of the professional
consequences which would flow from such false evidence if he were found out.
And there would have
to be a serious risk of risk of that happening as he, as a
barrister, would appreciate.
<P>

iii.	The fact that the draft statement of Coleman, was written out in long hand
by the plaintiffs' solicitors and the flow of the
draft statement support
Coleman's evidence as to the manner in which he gave his instructions for the
affidavit.  In contrast, the
only draft statements of Brown and Freeman which
were produced by their solicitor under notice to produce were notes for
evidence
typed by Brown.
<P>

43	Accordingly, the approach I intend to take is to select Coleman's account as
the evidentiary vehicle for the plaintiffs' case.
 He did not become actively
involved until 19 March 1992.  However, the implication is that the evidence of
Brown and Freeman on
any contentious matter, whether before or after that date,
must be disregarded as being of no weight.  That is because the implication
of
the selection is not only that Brown and Freeman's account of events on 19 and
20 March 1992 must be copied from Coleman's account
but also because their
evidence of how their respective accounts of those events came into existence
must be seriously incorrect
and their credit must be assumed to be
worthless.
<P>

44	I should stress that this is not a finding that the credit of Brown and
Freeman is worthless, only that it has to be treated
as worthless in view of
the course I am taking.  It is unnecessary for me to make any finding about
their credit and I make none.
<P>

45	Nor, have I made any finding at this stage of my reasoning that Coleman's
account of events is correct.  That falls to be considered
having regard to
other evidence, particularly the evidence of McLaughlin.
<P>

46	As to events prior to 19 March 1992, Coleman has little to say.  Brown and
Freeman have a great deal to say, but I will disregard
their evidence for the
reasons I have given.  My findings in relation to events prior to 17 March
1992, will be based on other evidence,
substantially that of senior and junior
counsel briefed in the Federal Court proceedings, P M Jacobson QC and R
Brender, and, to
some extent, McLaughlin.  
<P>

47	As to events between 17 and 23 March 1992, I have the evidence of Coleman,
McLaughlin, Jacobson, Brender and Buckley and some
documentary evidence.  
<P>

48	
<P>

	<b>Events prior to 17 March 1992</b>
<P>

49	In early 1991, Coleman, on behalf of Brown, asked McLaughlin if he could
recommend a solicitor to take over the conduct of the
Federal Court litigation.
McLaughlin offered to do so himself.
<P>

50	Brown and Freeman met with McLaughlin on 24 January 1991, when they
instructed him to act on behalf of the plaintiffs in the
Federal Court
proceedings.  Senior and junior counsel were briefed to advise in the matter as
early as February 1991.  Jacobson was
briefed as senior counsel and Brender was
briefed as junior counsel.  Both counsel were later briefed to appear at the
hearing.
<P>

51	After arranging the introduction, Brown and McLaughlin spoke to Coleman from
time to time about the Federal Court proceedings.
 Coleman states in his
affidavit that McLaughlin was particularly enthusiastic about the outcome of
the proceedings, saying that
United Systems would have to settle and mentioning
figures in the millions of dollars.
<P>

52	McLaughlin denies that he ever indicated to Brown or Freeman the value of
their claim.  He denies that he gave them any assurance
that the respondents
would settle or that the respondents had no defence.
<P>

53	McLaughlin says he told the plaintiffs they had a good case.  He says that
Brender told him Seamez had good prospects of succeeding,
and that counsel, at
no time prior to 17 March 1992, ever suggested that there were deficiencies in
Seamez's claim.  Jacobson confirms
that, in a conference with Brown and
McLaughlin, he told them that Seamez appeared to have good prospects assuming
the affidavit
evidence proved to be correct.
<P>

54	The difference between Coleman's evidence of what McLaughlin told him about
the prospects of the litigation and McLaughlin's
evidence of what he told Brown
and Freeman is one of degree, but of substantial degree.  Coleman's evidence
and McLaughlin's evidence
in this regard are not consistent.
<P>

55	In the course of the months leading up to the hearing McLaughlin attended to
a number of matters in preparation for the hearing.
 He briefed senior and
junior counsel, he arranged for counsel to draft a number of affidavits which
were sworn and filed in the
proceedings, he retained a number of expert
witnesses to prepare reports and to give evidence in the proceedings, and he
attended
to other matters which were necessary for the preparation of the case.

<P>

<b>56	</b>The plaintiffs claim that McLaughlin's preparation was deficient in
two respects.  Firstly, they complain that McLaughlin failed to
inspect
documents relating to the Equity proceedings within a reasonable time and,
secondly, that he failed to ensure that the respondents
provided proper
discovery.
<P>

	<b>Failure to inspect documents relating to Equity proceedings</b>
<P>

57	McLaughlin said that he was not told about the Equity proceedings until
about mid-June 1991  In cross-examination he conceded
that he may have been
incorrect in this regard (Tr.284) but that he did not receive any papers
relating to the Equity proceedings
until 18 March 1992.  McLaughlin conceded in
cross-examination that he should have inspected the files relating to the
Equity proceedings
earlier than he did (Tr.286-7).  He gave evidence that, in
October 1991, Brender asked him to find out more about the Supreme Court
proceedings.  He admitted that, in mid-October 1991, Brown signed authorities
for the purpose of obtaining access to files related
to those earlier
proceedings, authorising inspection of the Supreme Court file and the file held
by the plaintiffs' former solicitors,
Mannix Enright, who had acted in the
earlier proceedings.  McLaughlin conceded that he did not inspect the Supreme
Court file at
all, and that he inspected only some of the papers held by Mannix
Enright and then not until shortly before the hearing.
<P>

58	When McLaughlin saw documents from the Mannix Enright file, he formed the
view that they contradicted the evidence filed by Brown.
 The relevant
documents were notes prepared by Brown for his former solicitors in relation to
the Equity proceedings and affidavits
sworn by Brown and of Barkley in the
Equity proceedings.  In the notes, Brown wrote-
<P>

	"All of our products were formulated in the 1st instance by obtaining
formulation guidelines from raw material suppliers, such
as, ALBRIGHT &amp;
WILSON etc.  I would telephone the suppliers, make a request and receive the
formulations per post, after which,
BARKLEY produced the products.  BARKLEY
would use this information to assist him in manufacturing a product, although,
he would change
percentages of raw materials or add other cleaning agents,
depending what he considered most necessary, to suit our needs.  In short,
our
products have been formulated with the assistance of guidelines from raw
material suppliers and with adjustments or additives
made at the discretion of
BARKLEY."
<P>

59	McLaughlin was of the view that this contradicted Brown's assertion in the
Federal Court proceedings that it was he, rather than
Barkley, who had
developed the formulae for the products the subject of the Federal Court
proceedings.
<P>

60	Brown said, when confronted with these documents, that they did not
contradict what he had said in the Federal Court proceedings
for the following
reasons: the notes were only rough notes; in an affidavit sworn by Barkley in
the Equity proceedings, Barkley had
confirmed that he prepared products using
Brown's written instructions; and the product which was the subject of the
Equity proceedings
was not one of those which was the subject of the Federal
Court proceedings.  Brown told McLaughlin that Barkley had formulated products
for Seamez in accordance with instructions prepared by Brown.
<P>

61	The relevant affidavit sworn by Brown in the Equity proceedings, being an
affidavit sworn on 26 February 1987,  does not, of
itself, seem to me to
contain anything of serious significance.  In par 8 of that affidavit Brown
stated that the formula for the
Seamez product "Vanish" was derived from a list
of ingredients specified by a wholesaler, Albright &amp; Wilson.  That
observation
does not exclude a degree of originality in the formulation of a
product by Brown in relation to proportions and additives.
<P>

62	In par 18 of an affidavit sworn by Barkley in the Equity proceedings on 26
February 1987, Barkley did in fact assert that he
produced the products for
Seamez using written instructions given to him by Brown.  He stated-
<P>

	"I first mixed up "Vanish" for Seamez in late September or early October 1986.
I simply followed some directions off a sheet of
paper that was given to me by
Baden Brown."
<P>

63	At paragraph 19 of the affidavit he conceded that he had some discretion in
respect of developing formulae for Seamez.  He stated-
<P>

	"Annexed hereto and marked with the letter "B" is a true copy of the sheet
with formulations on it given to me by Baden Brown.
 The handwriting on the
sheet is mine.  I put it on after working for Seamez.  I wanted to lower the
ph. factor to make the liquid
about neutral.  I also made some other changes to
try and develop the product."
<P>

64	It does not seem to me that these affidavits and notes were a serious
embarrassment to the plaintiffs' case in the Federal Court
proceedings.  The
product, the subject of the notes and the affidavits, was not the subject of
the Federal Court proceedings.  The
notes were unlikely to have been in the
possession of the respondents' solicitors or likely to come into their
possession because
they were notes provided by Brown to his former solicitors
for the purposes of the Equity proceedings and, therefore, would have
been
subject to legal professional privilege.  The asserted inconsistency between
the notes and the affidavit evidence was argumentative
rather than being clear
cut.
<P>

	<b>Discovery</b>
<P>

65	Another matter in respect of which the plaintiffs complain was McLaughlin's
failure to ensure that the respondents provided proper
discovery.  McLaughlin,
Jacobson and Brender agreed that the respondents had still not provided
complete discovery by 20 March 1992
and that the documents sought in discovery
related to both quantum and liability.  The documents sought included the
respondents'
batch books, which are books containing the formulae for the
various products and the amount of product made up from each formula.
 The
plaintiffs hoped to use the batch books in support of their case that the
formulae being used by the respondents for the respondents'
products were
identical to Seamez's formulae and that the formulae were developed by
Seamez.
<P>

66	Between May 1991 and 20 March 1992 McLaughlin sent numerous letters to the
respondents' solicitors seeking proper discovery.
 
<P>

67	On 6 November 1991, counsel for the respondents proposed that he and Brender
should attempt to resolve the issue of discovery
by agreement failing which the
matter was to be re-listed on a motion for further and better discovery.
Further documents were discovered
and further correspondence and discussions
between McLaughlin and the respondent's solicitors took place.  
<P>

68	In early March 1992, McLaughlin filed a notice of motion seeking further
discovery.  On 9 March 1992, Shepherd J made an order
for supplementary
discovery and his Honour noted that, in the event that further discovery was
not provided, he might strike out
the defence.  On 18 March 1992, McLaughlin
sent a letter to the respondent's solicitors in which he raised the
deficiencies in discovery
and noted the plaintiffs' intention to raise these
deficiencies with the judge at the hearing on 23 March 1992.  On 20 March 1992,
McLaughlin drafted a further letter which was to be sent to the respondents'
solicitors relating to discovery, but the letter was
not sent.
<P>

69	On 20 March 1992, the Friday before the hearing, the respondents had still
not provided further discovery.  In cross-examination,
counsel for the
plaintiffs asked Brender whether the inadequacy of discovery would have created
difficulties at the hearing if it
had proceeded.  Brender gave the following
response (Tr 339/31-46)-
<P>

	"Well, I'm not sure.  On quantum, I think that possibly was dealt with or
could have been dealt with by leaving that to one side
as an issue.  Now, there
may have been difficulties in the case because we didn't have the documents
that we were perhaps entitled
at the moment, but I mean in a situation where
one party won't give you documents that you say exist, if they ultimately swear
an
affidavit of discovery or in some other way that they don't have the
documents, there is nothing further you can do.  So whilst it's
a problem for
the case, it doesn't mean you are in any better position by waiting or pressing
it any further.  So I'm not sure it's
the situation where you could say there
are X documents and you don't have them and if we get an adjournment or
postpone then in
some way we will have them and it will be different.  I'm not
sure that there were ever going to be any more documents on liability
on
them."
<P>

70	Despite the problems with discovery as of 17 March 1992 there was no
suggestion by Brender that the hearing on 23 March 1992
could not safely
proceed.  There was other evidence tending to establish that the respondent's
products were copies of Seamez's products,
namely, the expert evidence of Dr
Eckhard that United System's products were identical to Seamez's products and
the evidence of Brown
that the formulae for the Seamez products were developed
by him.  
<P>

71	Discovery of documents which showed the extent of sales by the respondents
of the products in question was necessary for an account
of profits but not for
the hearing on liability.
<P>

72	I am not satisfied that there was any breach of duty on the part of
McLaughlin in relation to discovery in view of the lack of
evidence that the
respondents in the Federal Court proceedings had anything further to discover
having the potential to sound in
damages in the present proceedings.
<P>

	<b>Jacobson returns his brief </b>
<P>

73	A major difficulty in relation to the proceedings arose on 17 March 1992.
<P>

74	On 17 March 1992, a conference took place between Jacobson, Brender, Brown
and Erica (an employee of McLaughlin O'Riordan). 
During the conference
Jacobson asked Brown a series of questions about the formulae for Seamez's
products and about how he had developed
the formulae, most of which Brown could
not answer.  Jacobson indicated to Brown that he was unhappy with his
performance.  
<P>

75	As a result of the conference, Jacobson formed the view that Brown could not
have formulated the products himself, that Brown's
main affidavit in the
Federal Court proceedings, sworn on 19 July 1991, was not in substance his own
and that it had been prepared
only with considerable assistance by Freeman.  He
also had concerns about the fact that Freeman, being a witness in the
proceedings,
had been present when Brown had given the instructions for the
preparation of his affidavit.  The former problem was, however, Jacobson's
main
concern.  He did not think he could conscientiously present Brown's affidavit
as being Brown's own evidence in view of the opinion
he had formed about the
true source of what was in it.
<P>

76	Later that evening, 17 March 1992, Jacobson informed Brender and McLaughlin
of his views and of his intention to obtain a ruling
from the president of the
Bar Council as to whether it would be inappropriate for him to return his
brief.  
<P>

77	On the morning of 18 March 1992, Jacobson obtained a ruling from the then
president of the Bar Council.  According to Jacobson,
either at an early
morning conference with McLaughlin and Brender or later that day, he told
McLaughlin of the ruling and of his
decision to return the brief.
<P>

78	McLaughlin says that it was on the evening of 17 March 1992 that he spoke to
Brown about Jacobson's departure from the case and
recommended that Brown
consider settlement.  In his affidavit sworn 16 April 1998, McLaughlin said
that, on the evening of 17 March
1992, he gave Brown the following advice-
<P>

	"We have a problem.  Peter won't run the case.  He says it is obvious from his
conference with you that you don't know the chemistry
and won't be believed
about having developed the formulae.  We will have great difficulty getting an
adjournment - we have no grounds
for one.  If we can't get an adjournment we'll
be forced on and probably lose, from what Peter Jacobson says.  In light of
what he
has said I think you should settle the case.  You are going to be in
too much trouble in cross examination".
<P>

79	In response to this, McLaughlin says that Brown asked him to find an
alternative Queens Counsel and to proceed with the hearing.
 McLaughlin says
that at a conference with Brown on 18 March 1992, McLaughlin repeated the same
advice to him.  
<P>

80	Brown denies that any such advice was given on those dates.
<P>

81	McLaughlin says that on 18 and 19 March 1992, he made several attempts to
find alternative Queens Counsel but was unsuccessful.
<P>

82	Jacobson also gave evidence that Freeman was told on 18 March 1992 of his
decision to withdraw from the case.  He said that at
around noon on 18 March
1992, at a conference with her, Brender and McLaughlin told Freeman his views
about the case and about the
credibility of Brown and he also told her of his
decision to withdraw from the case.
<P>

83	In cross-examination, McLaughlin said that, although his view about the
plaintiff's prospects of success in the Federal Court
proceedings changed as a
result of Jacobson's views and as a result of the documents seen in relation to
the Equity proceedings,
he still - even on 20 March 1992 - believed that the
plaintiffs had a slightly better than 50% chance of succeeding (Tr.272-5).
<P>

84	On this evidence, it is clear at least that, by 18 March 1992, Jacobson was
out of the case and attempts were being made to find
another leader.
<P>

	<b>Meeting between McLaughlin, Coleman and Brown on 19 March 1992</b>
<P>

	<b><i>McLaughlin's account</i></b>
<P>

85	McLaughlin's account of this meeting is as follows.  McLaughlin arranged to
meet with Coleman and Brown at about 11.30am on 19
March 1992.  He states that,
at this meeting, the topics discussed were Jacobson's views about the case and
the documents that McLaughlin
had received from Mannix Enright.  During the
conference McLaughlin says he told Brown the following -
<P>

	"So far I have not been able to get a silk to take on the case.  I don't
recommend that you can let Rodney Brender run it alone.
 He hasn't the
seniority for something as large and complex as this.
<P>

	You can't substantiate what you've said in your affidavit of 19 July 1991 as
to the development of those formulae.  These documents
from the other case
contradict what you say about development of the formulae.
<P>

	Jacobson says you won't be believed.  There is a question about whether you
will be able to rely upon your affidavit anyway because
Jacobson says it was
really not yours but Geraldine's <i>(ie Freeman's)</i>.  Geraldine was present
when Brender took the affidavit.
<P>

	Jacobson says you'll lose the case.  Your alternatives are to run it and
probably lose it or try to settle it now for some lesser
payment to the other
side.  If you run it for two weeks and lose you'll pay their costs as well as
your own - possibly as much as
a quarter of a million dollars all up."
<P>

86	McLaughlin says he then suggested that they try to negotiate a settlement
for the payment of $20-30,000 to the respondents. 
He does not say what Brown's
response was to this suggestion.
<P>

	<b><i>Coleman's account</i></b>
<P>

87	Coleman's account of this meeting is different.  He says that, on 19 March
1992, at McLaughlin's urgent request, he attended
a meeting at McLaughlin's
office with Brown.  
<P>

88	Unlike McLaughlin's account, Coleman says that the meeting was conducted in
a light hearted mood.  He agrees that the matters
discussed at this meeting
were Jacobson's view of the case and the contents of notes that Brown had
prepared for his solicitors in
the Equity proceedings.  
<P>

89	According to Coleman, Brown re-assured McLaughlin that the affidavit was his
own and that he would be ready to give his evidence
at the hearing on the
Monday.  Coleman says he also re-assured McLaughlin that Brown would be ready
to give evidence at the hearing.
<P>

90	McLaughlin then questioned Brown on the contents of the notes that Brown had
prepared for his former solicitors, Mannix Enright,
in relation to the Equity
proceedings and upon which McLaughlin expected that Brown would be
cross-examined.
<P>

91	Coleman says that all these matters were discussed in a jocular fashion.  In
particular, there was no discussion of settlement,
nor any suggestion that the
case could not proceed.  
<P>

	<b>Early morning telephone call between Coleman and McLaughlin</b>
<P>

92	Coleman says that, on Friday morning, 20 March 1992, McLaughlin telephoned
Coleman and asked him to meet him urgently later in
the day.  On the telephone,
McLaughlin told Coleman that the plaintiffs could not win because both
barristers had left the case.
 Coleman says McLaughlin also told him that
Jacobson had left the case because he did not believe Brown and that Brender
had left
because he had breached a bar rule about interviewing two witnesses
together.  Coleman agreed to go to the meeting.
<P>

93	McLaughlin says that he does not recall this telephone conversation with
Coleman and he denies that he ever told Coleman or anyone
else that both
barristers had left the case.
<P>

94	Brender gave evidence that he was always willing to appear at the hearing of
the proceedings but that he did not feel confident
that he could run the case
without senior counsel and that he had conveyed this view to McLaughlin.
<P>

	<b>First meeting on 20 March 1992:  McLaughlin, Brown and Coleman</b>
<P>

	<b><i>McLaughlin's account</i></b>
<P>

95	McLaughlin says that, on 20 March 1992, at some time in the early afternoon,
he met with Coleman and Brown.  In cross-examination,
McLaughlin said that, at
this meeting (Tr.314) he -
<P>

	"explained to Baden <i>(ie Brown)</i> and to Coleman the difficulties
associated with the running of the matter, in that I still had not been able to
get a leader; that
Jacobson had a very firm view that Baden would not do very
well in cross examination and might be in difficulty; that it would be
a matter
for whoever ran the matter as to whether or not Geraldine's affidavit was to be
used or not, and that the down side to it,
if it did not go well, could be a
large amount of money to be paid by Baden".
<P>

96	The meeting ended around 1.30 pm.  
<P>

	<b><i>Coleman's account</i></b>
<P>

97	Coleman says the meeting was at about 11.30am that day.  There was no
jocularity this time.  McLaughlin said that both counsel
had left the case -
Jacobson because he did not believe that Brown's affidavit was his own and
Brender because he had to report himself
to the Bar Association - and that
Seamez had to settle because they could not win.
<P>

98	Coleman's account of the meeting then proceeded as follows.  Coleman asked
whether they could get an adjournment.  McLaughlin
said they would not get away
with that.  He said that the other side wanted to settle on a walkaway basis
and that there was $30,000
in the kitty that would probably cover costs.  Both
sides could then go on their own way in peace.
<P>

99	According to Coleman, Brown's response to this suggestion was one of anger.
McLaughlin repeated his advice that as both counsel
had left the case they
could not go on.  He said he could try to find alternative counsel but they
would only have the weekend to
learn the brief and it would cost $30,000 to
brief them.  (McLaughlin denies that he ever said that it would cost $30,000 to
brief
new counsel).  According to Coleman, Brown requested that McLaughlin
brief new counsel and have them apply for the matter to be adjourned
to a new
date to which McLaughlin replied - 
<P>

	"They [the respondents] are ready to go and they will oppose the application.
The best we could get would be for the Court to give
us another day to prepare
so that it would start Tuesday instead of Monday.  That doesn't help us, and if
they force us on it will
cost you $250,000."
<P>

100	Coleman's evidence is that Brown was very upset at the suggestion of
settlement, and that he asked McLaughlin to apply for an
adjournment and to
find new counsel regardless of the cost involved.  According to Coleman, in
response to Brown's request for new
counsel McLaughlin said-
<P>

	"Baden you can't win, you can't go on, you will lose.  If you settle you will
live again to fight them another day when you can
win.  A settlement won't stop
you taking further proceedings if they continue to sell your products.  Baden,
I'm trying to save you.
 I don't want you putting any more money into this
case."
<P>

101	According to Coleman, towards the end of the meeting, McLaughlin told them
that he was going to contact the other side's solicitors
to see if he could get
them to agree to a lower amount in settlement and he asked Coleman to go away
and speak to Brown about the
situation. 
<P>

	<b>Discussion between Coleman and Brown on the way to the factory</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

102	Coleman and Brown then drove to Seamez's factory.  On the way there,
according to Coleman, they discussed what Brown wanted
to do.  In the course of
this discussion Brown mentioned a settlement offer of $500,000 that McLaughlin
had allegedly told them about
just the previous day and the fact that they had
rejected it.  Coleman advised Brown that he should listen to McLaughlin and
weigh
up what McLaughlin said as sound professional advice.  Brown told him
that he wanted to go on with the case and that his major concern
was to protect
his products from exploitation by United Systems.  That was Coleman's account
of the conversation in the car.
<P>

103	According to Coleman, Brown had not agreed to anything by way of settlement
at this stage, nor suggested that he would.
<P>

	<b>Telephone call between Brown and McLaughlin and between Coleman and
McLaughlin during the afternoon of 20 March 1992</b>
<P>

	<b><i>McLaughlin's account</i></b>
<P>

104	According to McLaughlin, at around 2.00pm, he received a telephone call
from Coleman (although in cross-examination he said
that it was from Brown:
Tr.314) in which he received instructions to settle the case.  In his oral
evidence, McLaughlin stated that
his only recollection of his instructions was
that he was to settle the case for $20,000 or $30,000.  In his affidavit, at
par 106,
he states that he received instructions in the terms set out in a the
facsimile letter written by him to Brown.   The facsimile confirmation
slip
confirms that the letter in question was faxed to Seamez's office at 2.11pm on
20 March 1992.  Brown says that he did not see
the facsimile letter until
Monday, 23 March 1992.  The letter states - 
<P>

	"We confirm our conversation at 2.00 pm today in that your instructions are
for us to settle this matter for payment of up to $30,000.00
to United Systems
and that mutual releases of present and past actions will be given by all
parties to the other parties to the proceedings.
<P>

	We confirm that we are confident that the matter will settle for the payment
of only $20,000.00 and we are hopeful that this will
be achieved today.
<P>

	We confirm Mr Coleman's telephone instructions that we are to include
provision in the deed that the terms of settlement are not
to be disclosed by
any of the parties to any other person.
<P>

	We shall advise you immediately the matter has been settled."
<P>

105	The letter is relied on by McLaughlin as a record of what was said in the
telephone conversation about the terms of a proposed
settlement, in addition to
the settlement figures of $30,000 and $20,000.  In relation to such other
terms, the letter is, however,
very ambiguous.  McLaughlin said in his evidence
that "actions" (in the letter) meant proceedings which would make "present
action(s)"
a reference to the Federal Court proceedings and "past action(s)" a
reference to the Equity Court proceedings.  Because the position
of the
respective parties, as plaintiffs and defendants, was reversed in the two
proceedings, such a release would have been "mutual".
 The releases would be
confined to the claims made in the respective proceedings.  But in what sense
would there be a "release of
(such) actions"?  Did that mean simply
discontinuance of the two proceedings?  Or did it mean that each side would be
released from
whatever claims were made by the other in the respective
proceedings?  That was not clear.  On the other hand, if actions meant conduct,
each side would be releasing the other from liability for anything and
everything done up to the moment of settlement, but would
not be precluded by
the deed from acting as they wished thereafter.  So the letter was ambiguous in
more than one way.
<P>

106	Because of these ambiguities, it is not possible to discern from the letter
what McLaughlin asserted to have been the terms
of the telephone conversation
beyond the settlement figures of $30,000 or $20,000, or to infer from the
letter what was said.
<P>

	<b><i>Coleman's account</i></b>
<P>

107	Coleman's evidence was as follows.  He says that, while he was with Brown
at the factory, McLaughlin telephoned and spoke first
to Brown.  Brown told
Coleman that McLaughlin told him that the other side had agreed to a settlement
of $20,000.  Coleman then spoke
to McLaughlin on the telephone.   Coleman says
that, in this conversation, McLaughlin told him that Fulton (who figured on the
other
side) had taken out a defamation writ for $300,000 against Brown which
the other side was going to serve on him before Court on Monday,
and had also
taken out a Mareva injunction which they would serve at the same time and which
would prevent Brown from dealing with
any assets, so that he would be unable to
continue in business.  On the other hand, if the matter settled the other side
would not
proceed with the writ and the injunction.  (McLaughlin denies that he
said anything about a Mareva injunction or a defamation suit.)
<P>

108	Coleman says he told Brown what McLaughlin had said to him about the writ
and the injunction and then continued to discuss settlement
with McLaughlin.
He said that he told McLaughlin-
<P>

	"..the money doesn't concern Baden, he's more concerned about protecting his
products and stopping the manufacture of them."
<P>

109	McLaughlin asked Coleman to come and see him with Brown and Freeman and to
bring the company seal.
<P>

110	Christopher Herbert Brown ("Chris Brown"), the solicitor acting for the
respondents in the Federal Court proceedings gave evidence
that he had never
told McLaughlin that Fulton or any other party whom he represented had
commenced defamation proceedings nor that
United Systems had taken out a Mareva
injunction against Seamez or Brown.  Defamation proceedings were never in fact
commenced against
Brown and no application for a Mareva injunction against
Seamez or against Brown was ever made.
<P>

	<b><i>Comment on the two accounts</i></b>
<P>

111	The important difference between these two accounts of the telephone
conversation is not whether McLaughlin genuinely understood
from the
conversation that he had instructions to settle for up to $30,000 to be paid by
Seamez.  Plainly that was his understanding.
 The letter makes that clear.
Coleman's account of the conversation is not seriously inconsistent with that.
Coleman acknowledges
that he was told by McLaughlin that the case could be
settled for a payment of $20,000 and that he (Coleman) told McLaughlin that
Brown was not concerned about paying money to settle the case.  That this was
McLaughlin's understanding of his instructions is further
confirmed by the
terms of the draft deed which Mr Chris Brown sent him later that day and which
cannot have appeared out of thin
air.  Further confirmation is to be found in
McLaughlin's request that Brown bring Freeman and the company seal.  As far as
McLaughlin
was concerned, the case was going to settle.
<P>

112	Two things are important about the account of the conversation given by
Coleman:  First, there was the alleged  mention of the
writ and the Mareva
injunction.  (Brown said he was not concerned about the writ, but the Mareva
injunction - as allegedly explained
by McLaughlin - would have been of grave
concern.)  Secondly, there was Brown's insistence on protecting his products
and stopping
United Systems from manufacturing them.  That was going to have to
be accommodated to Brown's satisfaction in the proposed settlement
if Coleman's
account of the conversation is correct.  The letter of 20 March 1992 did not
resolve the question of what, if anything,
was said about these matters in the
telephone conversation.
<P>

	<b>The first draft of the deed</b>
<P>

113	By the time a further meeting took place in McLaughlin's office later in
the day of 20 March 1992, a draft deed had  arrived
from Chris Brown, United
System's solicitor.
<P>

114	By cl 2(i) of the draft deed, the Federal Court proceedings were to be
dismissed by consent.
<P>

115	Clauses 1, 4 and 5 of the draft deed provided, so far as is material, as
follows.  (The "Releasors" were the plaintiffs. The
"Releasees" were United
Systems and its associates.)
<P>

"1(a)	  In this deed including the recitals the following expressions shall
have the following meanings unless inconsistent with
the context.
<P>

<center>...</center>
<P>

`Intellectual Property' includes all computer programmes, formulae, brochures,
labels, marketing, advertising literature, patents,
client lists, sales lists,
price lists and processes used by the Releasees and/or any one or more of them
at any time down to and
including the date of this deed in any business,
employment or other engagement of the Releasees and/or any one or more of them
at
any time down to and including the date of this deed. 
<P>

<center>....</center>
<P>

4.	The Releasors hereby release the Releasees from all actions costs, claims
expenses, interest and demands of each and every kind
whatsoever which the
Releasors and/or any one or more of them now have or could would or might have
upon or against the Releasees
and/or any one or more of them, whether known or
unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with:
<P>

(i)	any act allegedly done or omitted to be done by the Releasees and/or any
one or more of them, the subject of the Proceedings,
or allegedly giving rise
to the relief claimed by the applicant Seamez in the proceedings; and
<P>

(ii)	any act done or omitted to be done by the Releasees and/or any one or more
of them in the course of the business activities
of the Releasees and or any
one or more of the Releasees.
<P>

5(i)	The Releasors and each of them acknowledge and declare that the Releasors
and each of them have no rights or interests whatsoever
in the Intellectual
Property.
<P>

(ii)	The Releasors and each of them will not at any time in the future assert
or make any allegation whatsoever that the Releasors
and/or any one or more of
them have any interest whatsoever in the Intellectual Property."
<P>

116	The meaning and effect of these clauses was, materially, as follows.  By cl
4, the plaintiffs would release United Systems and
its associates from all
claims made in the Federal Court proceedings and from anything done in their
business activities to that
date.
<P>

117	By cl 5, the plaintiffs would be precluded from asserting an interest in
any formula used or product marketed by United Systems
or its associates
(including the Beer Line cleaner product) prior to that date.  This clause
would bar any future proceedings by
Seamez to prevent United Systems from
marketing any product the company had marketed to date (including the Beer Line
cleaner product)
or to claim damages for that, irrespective of whether such
marketing would otherwise have been actionable by Seamez.
<P>

118	Clauses 7 and 9 precluded the plaintiffs from disclosing information about
United Systems and its associates, or the contents
of the deed.
<P>

119	The draft deed contained no release of any kind by United Systems and their
associates.
<P>

120	All the foregoing provisions in the draft deed would be meaningless or not
easily understood by a lay person without explanation,
or at least easily
misunderstood. 
<P>

	<b>Second meeting on 20 March 1992:  McLaughlin, Buckley, Brown, Freeman and
Coleman</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	<i>McLaughlin's and Buckley's account</i></b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

121	McLaughlin says that, following the telephone call to Seamez' office, he
telephoned Chris Brown, solicitor for the other side,
and they agreed in
principle to a settlement by the payment of $20,000 to the respondents and for
the terms of the settlement to
remain confidential.  He says he then arranged
for Brown and Freeman to attend his office with Coleman to execute a deed.  The
draft
deed arrived.
<P>

122	McLaughlin's account of the meeting was as follows. McLaughlin read out to
the plaintiffs the operative parts of the draft deed,
clause by clause, and
some of the definitions in the draft deed.  In particular he said (at para 116
of his affidavit) that he explained
to the plaintiffs that the effect of the
release contained in the draft deed was -
<P>

	"not just in relation to the products which are the subject of the proceeding.
It goes beyond that to release them from liability
for their use of formulae of
any other products which they have used in their business down to the present
time."
<P>

That accorded with the terms of the draft deed.
<P>

123	McLaughlin said he gave Coleman a copy of the draft deed to read.  Coleman
read the draft, and agreed with the explanation that
McLaughlin had given
concerning the effect of the document.
<P>

124	According to McLaughlin, Brown asked him to try and obtain the respondents'
consent to limit the deed to the products the subject
of the proceedings.
McLaughlin says he told Brown that he would try, but that he did not think that
the respondents would agree to
that.  According to McLaughlin, Brown also
raised a concern that Fulton might try and commence defamation proceedings
against him.
 (This was McLaughlin's evidence of how the topic of defamation
proceedings was first raised.)
<P>

125	McLaughlin's oral evidence in these respects conflicts with the evidence he
gave in his affidavit.  In his affidavit, at par
143, McLaughlin stated:
<P>

	"No-one suggested during this conference that the release should be confined
to the respondent's use of product formulae and recipes
up to the date of the
deed.  No-one suggested that the release should leave the applicant free to
commence later proceedings in respect
of any subsequent use of formulae and
recipes, the confidentiality and ownership of which had been in contest in the
proceedings."
<P>

126	In cross-examination, McLaughlin agreed that Brown and Freeman urged him at
this meeting to ensure that the settlement would
not prevent them from taking
action in the future to protect their products (Tr 351).  He said the
respondents refused to agree to
that.
<P>

127	In his affidavit, at par 145, McLaughlin said:
<P>

	"Baden Brown did not instruct me that the Applicant would not give a release
in relation to the Respondents' manufacture of a product
which appeared to be a
copy of Seamez' beer line cleaner, Parts 1 and 2.  Had he suggested that I
would have expressed the view that
there would be no prospect of the
Respondents agreeing to exempt those two products from the release."
<P>

128	However, in cross-examination, McLaughlin admitted that Brown said at this
meeting that he would prefer it if the deed did not
apply to the Beer Line
Cleaner products (Tr 350).  Again, his affidavit evidence conflicted with his
oral evidence.
<P>

129	McLaughlin says he telephoned Chris Brown and asked him to obtain his
clients' instructions as to whether they would agree to
limit the deed to the
products the subject of the proceedings, to give Seamez the same benefits as
were given to the respondents
in cls 6, 7 and 9, and to the inclusion of a
provision protecting Brown from any potential defamation proceedings by Fulton.
According
to McLaughlin, Chris Brown telephoned him back and said that his
clients would agree to the proposed changes with the exception of
limiting the
deed to the products the subject of the proceedings.  McLaughlin says he told
Brown, Freeman and Coleman what Chris
Brown had said to him.
<P>

130	McLaughlin in cross-examination (Tr.280) conceded that the releases in the
draft deed were not mutual, in that Seamez, unlike
United Systems, had no
protection against further suit by its competitor.  McLaughlin said, however,
that he understood this was
acceptable to the plaintiffs because Brown had
assured him that Seamez was not copying any of United Systems' products.
<P>

131	According to McLaughlin, Brown asked him whether the deed took away his
proprietary interest in his products.  McLaughlin says
he told Brown that this
was not the case.  As Brown did not appear to be re-assured by McLaughlin's
explanation about the effect
of the deed, McLaughlin says he asked Buckley to
explain the effect of the deed to him.
<P>

132	McLaughlin was absent from the room when Buckley provided an explanation of
the deed.  In his affidavit, at par 29, Buckley
said that he gave the following
explanation to Brown and Freeman in relation to the deed -
<P>

	"In the deed, both Brown and Seamez are acknowledging that they had no
exclusive proprietary interest in the chemical formulae
referred to in the
definition of intellectual property".
<P>

133	According to Buckley he then read out the definition of intellectual
property and said-
<P>

	"By making this acknowledgment you are giving up any right to assert or
enforce such an exclusive proprietary interest".
<P>

134	In cross-examination, Buckley's evidence as to the explanation given to the
plaintiffs in relation to the deed was substantially
the same as his affidavit
evidence with one important exception.  In cross-examination, he said that he
told the plaintiffs (Tr.410)-
<P>

	"They were foregoing, sorry, they were acknowledging they couldn't assert
their proprietary interest in that intellectual property
up to that date, and
that any further formulae recipes, intellectual property that they acquired,
wasn't affected".
<P>

135	According to Buckley, after giving his explanation of the draft deed, he
then had a brief discussion with Coleman about the
document and returned to his
office.  He conceded that Brown appeared to be upset and that he appeared to be
unhappy about settling.
<P>

136	I have to say that an explanation of the deed in the terms which Buckley
says he used would have meant no more to a lay person
than the terms of the
deed itself, or would have been as easily misunderstood at the least.
<P>

137	McLaughlin then re-entered his office and, according to him, Brown said he
now understood the effect of the draft deed.
<P>

138	A second version of the draft deed was soon after delivered to McLaughlin's
office.  McLaughlin complained to Chris Brown that
it did not incorporate all
the agreed changes.
<P>

139	A third and final version of the deed was sent shortly thereafter. 
<P>

140	The final draft differed from the initial draft only in the following
respect, so far as is material.  It incorporated a new
cl 10 which provided the
plaintiffs with a comprehensive release in relation to anything done by them to
the date of the deed.  That
effectively put an end to the Equity proceedings.

<P>

141	According to McLaughlin, when the third version arrived, he read out the
operative parts of the draft deed to Brown, Freeman
and Coleman explaining the
changes to the draft as he went along.  He says he then went to Buckley's
office where he, in the presence
of Chris Brown, added a cl 13 to the deed in
handwriting.  Clause 13 imposed a similar obligation of confidentiality on
United Systems
and its associates as the earlier drafts had imposed on the
plaintiffs.  The "mutuality" objective had been achieved.
<P>

142	According to McLaughlin, after this further change was made, he showed the
draft to Brown and Freeman, and they executed the
document.  Both he and
Buckley were present when the deed was executed.  He denied that Brown signed
the deed "under protest" (as
Brown asserted he did).
<P>

	<b><i>Coleman's account</i></b>
<P>

143	Coleman's account of this meeting was as follows.  
<P>

144	Brown, Freeman and Coleman met with McLaughlin at his office at around
4.30pm on 20 March 1992.  Coleman told McLaughlin that
Brown was not happy
about settling and would prefer to fight it out in court, but that he was
willing to listen to McLaughlin's advice.
 McLaughlin then repeated his earlier
advice, namely, that they had no counsel, that Brown could not win the case and
that he had
to settle.
<P>

145	A draft deed of settlement was received by McLaughlin shortly after they
arrived.  McLaughlin read the document to himself and
made occasional comments
about it as he did so, but he did not explain its contents or its effect.  
<P>

146	While McLaughlin was reading through the deed, an office girl came into his
office to let him know that Brender was on the phone
wanting to know what was
happening.  McLaughlin told her to tell Brender that he would call him back.
<P>

147	According to Coleman, a copy of the draft deed was given to him while
McLaughlin was out of the room briefly, and Coleman only
had a brief
opportunity to read through it quickly.  Coleman said that he was aghast at
what he read because the terms of the draft
deed amounted, in his view, to a
total surrender on the part of Seamez.  He said that he told the plaintiffs
that they should not
sign the draft deed because it gave away all of Brown's
rights to his products.
<P>

148	When McLaughlin returned to his office, there was a discussion about
changes that should be made to the draft deed.  According
to Coleman, he told
McLaughlin that Brown would never agree to a settlement in which he had to give
up his rights to his products.
 Coleman states in his affidavit that he told
McLaughlin to have the following amendments incorporated into the deed -
<P>

(a)	The deed was to be confined to the 11 products that were the subject of the
proceedings but should exclude the Seamez Beer Line
1 and 2 cleaners.
<P>

(b)	The settlement should apply only up to the date of the deed, so that if the
respondents continued to produce the products in
question after that date Brown
would be able to commence proceedings against them.
<P>

(e)	There should be provision for mutual releases.
<P>

(f)	A clause for non-disclosure of the settlement terms should be included.
<P>

(g)	A clause requiring withdrawal of the Fulton defamation suit and the Mareva
injunction should also be included.
<P>

149	McLaughlin then had several telephone conversations with the respondents'
solicitors in which he discussed the proposed amendments.
<P>

150	Some time later, according to Coleman, Buckley came into McLaughlin's
office to give him a revised draft deed which had arrived.
 McLaughlin asked
Buckley to give him a hand checking the draft deed as he (McLaughlin) had a
plane to catch.  McLaughlin and Buckley
checked the draft together.  McLaughlin
or Buckley would quote a paragraph number and would say "Releasors, Releasees"
and would
write on the draft.  As McLaughlin and Buckley went through the
revised draft deed, McLaughlin said it did not include the proposed
amendments.
McLaughlin then made a phone call to someone and told them to deliver another
deed which did incorporate the proposed
changes.
<P>

151	There was then further discussions about the draft deed.  Brown said that
he wanted the deed to be confined to the eleven products
less the Beer Line
cleaners and this was non-negotiable.  McLaughlin reassured Brown that the
respondents had agreed that the two
Beer Line cleaner products would not be
included in the deed.
<P>

152	Coleman said that the releases should be mutual and not one way.
McLaughlin said that was right and that the other side would
agree to that.
McLaughlin also said that the respondents would agree to withdrawing the
defamation proceedings and the Mareva injunction.
<P>

153	According to Coleman, Brown became very emotional, saying everything was
happening too fast and that he wanted the weekend to
think the matter over.
Coleman says that he and McLaughlin tried to calm Brown down.  Coleman said to
McLaughlin (Coleman affidavit,
para 33)-
<P>

	"Bob, is this what they've agreed to The Beer Line cleaners are out.  He drops
his claim over the other 9 products and lets them
keep the profits they've made
from their sales of those 9 up to now, the date of the agreement.  Baden pays
$20,000 to cover the
costs of the hearing and in return they will not pursue
any other costs and will withdraw the defamation and injunction.  Each side
then goes about its business in peace.  If they keep the peace then everything
is finished for good and everybody is happy, but if
they want to be naughty in
the future, then Baden can use the evidence he has already obtained in starting
fresh proceedings.
<P>

	Bob <i>(ie McLaughlin)</i> said:
<P>

	`Yes that's the agreement they're prepared to sign'"
<P>

154	McLaughlin denies that he represented to the plaintiffs that the deed would
be confined to the products the subject of the proceedings,
that it would not
include the Beer Line Cleaner and that it would preserve the plaintiffs' right
to take proceedings against the
respondents in the future.
<P>

155	According to Coleman, despite McLaughlin's reassurances, Brown still
requested that he be given overnight to think the matter
over.  McLaughlin
asked Buckley whether he could see Brown the following day to finalise the
deed.  Buckley said that the deed had
to be signed that night or the deal was
off.  McLaughlin then said to Buckley (Coleman affidavit, para 35)-
<P>

	"Richard, Baden is worried about the future of his business, will you tell him
if this is right ?  What they are agreeing to is
that they are forgiven for
their sins and escape with what they have got away with in relation to the 9
products.  The Beer Line
cleaners are not part of the agreement.  If they
manufacture any Seamez products from this date, Baden is free to pursue them
using
the same evidence.  If they don't everyone is happy and peace will
reign.
<P>

	Buckley said:
<P>

	`Yes, exactly, in respect of any of your products provided you establish your
proprietary rights.'"
<P>

156	Again, this is not what the current draft deed provided.  It precluded
Seamez from suing in relation to the marketing of any
products which had been
marked by United Systems or its associates to date, and it released United
Systems and its associates from
any liability for past infringements.  Under
the current draft, United Systems could continue to market the products of
which the
plaintiffs complained, including the Beer Line cleaner product, and
would be immune from action against past infringements, including
the Beer Line
cleaner product.
<P>

157	Coleman says he then left to keep another appointment.  So it is common
ground that Coleman had left before the final version
of the deed arrived.
<P>

	<b>Execution of the deed and the settlement</b>
<P>

158	It was after Coleman left that Brown and Freeman executed the deed.
McLaughlin says that, after Coleman left, the third and
final version of the
deed was delivered to his office by Chris Brown.  McLaughlin says that he read
out the operative part of the
deed to Brown and Freeman.  Brown and Freeman
deny that.  Brown says he signed the deed "under protest".  That also is
disputed.
<P>

159	None of this matters.  The deed would have been unintelligible to a lay
person or at least very easily misunderstood.  What
matters is what was said
earlier about the meaning and effect of the deed.  That, as I have indicated,
is in dispute.
<P>

160	Terms of settlement were handed up in court on Monday, 23 March 1992 by
Brender.
<P>

	<b>Coleman's Credibility</b>
<P>

161	As mentioned previously, counsel for the defendants submits that Coleman's
evidence is a reconstruction tailored to support
the account given by Brown in
Brown's typed statements and affidavit.  The following submissions were made
impugning Coleman's credit:
<P>

a.	Coleman did not give his instructions for his affidavit until 15 June 1994,
and it is highly unlikely that he could have genuinely
recalled in such detail
conversations which took place two years earlier.
<P>

b.	There are significant similarities between Coleman's affidavit, on the one
hand, and that of Brown and Freeman, on the other,
concerning the meetings of
19 and 20 March 1992, and no explanation has been advanced to account for these
similarities.
<P>

c.	There are significant differences between the draft statement by Coleman
made on 15 June 1994 and the affidavit he later swore
on 28 February 1997.  The
differences consist of additional evidence not included in the draft statement
and which also appears in
Brown's typed statements which Brown said were
prepared in April 1992.
<P>

162	In support of Coleman's credibility counsel for the plaintiff's advanced
the following arguments-
<P>

a.	He was the only truly independent witness.
<P>

b.	His position as a barrister makes it unlikely that he would lie in an
affidavit or collude with others in the preparation of
an affidavit because of
the possible professional implications of such conduct.
<P>

c.	He was present at the meetings on 19 and 20 March 1992 at the request of
McLaughlin.
<P>

d.	The form of his draft statement supports his evidence as to the manner in
which his affidavit was prepared.
<P>

e.	The differences between Coleman's draft statement and his affidavit sworn 14
September 1997 are explicable on the basis that
his recollection of the events
was enhanced by reading his draft statement and by the solicitor legitimately
taking his mind to topics
for consideration or more detailed consideration.  In
any event, the initial statement includes the more important parts of the
conversations
as recounted in the affidavit.
<P>

	<b>Submissions in relation to the credibility of McLaughlin</b>
<P>

163	Counsel for the plaintiffs impugned McLaughlin's credibility on the
following grounds-
<P>

a.	McLaughlin's version of events which took place on 20 March 1992 is
inherently improbable because it suggests that in the space
of one afternoon
the plaintiffs went from being enthusiastic litigants to being willing to
settle the case on very unfavourable terms.
 
<P>

b.	McLaughlin's evidence is not supported by any independent witnesses or any
documentary evidence.
<P>

c.	McLaughlin recorded no account of the meetings of 19 and 20 March 1992 when,
shortly after the settlement, it was apparent that
the plaintiffs were
disgruntled and had retained another solicitor in relation to the settlement.
Nor did he attempt to obtain a
statement from Coleman at any stage.  It is
submitted that it can be inferred from these omissions that McLaughlin was not
in a position
to record a favourable recollection of events that would support
his case and that he knew Coleman would not support a favourable
version of
events.  The omission to approach Coleman assumes particular significance in
light of the fact that Coleman was a friend
of McLaughlin.
<P>

d.	There were serious discrepancies between McLaughlin's affidavit and his oral
evidence.
<P>

	<b>Conclusions as to credit</b>
<P>

164	I do not accept that Coleman was a truly independent witness.  Although he
had a longstanding and friendly association with
McLaughlin, he had a closer
friendship with Brown.  However, he had no significant personal interest in the
proceedings.  If anything,
having referred Brown to McLaughlin, his personal
interest was to support McLaughlin's handling of the settlement
negotiations.
<P>

165	As to the similarities between Coleman's evidence and that of Brown and
Freeman, these are capable of being explained on the
basis that Brown and
Freeman's evidence was copied from Coleman's statement and affidavit.  I
appreciate that a finding that Coleman
has been truthful in this respect
implies that Brown and Freeman have not, but that does not affect Coleman's
credit.
<P>

166	I found the arguments advanced in support of Coleman's credibility very
persuasive.  I found Coleman's oral evidence in relation
to the meetings on 19
and 20 March 1992 very persuasive as it was being given.  By contrast, I was
not so impressed by McLaughlin's
oral evidence.  He could not recall many
important matters such as the terms of his instructions to settle, the person
who gave him
the instructions to settle and much of the explanation that he
gave in relation to the terms of the deed.  The reliability of his
evidence is
further put in doubt by the fact that he did not swear an affidavit in relation
to these proceedings until 16 April 1998,
six years after the events to which
he deposed.  Then there was the evidence he gave in cross-examination about the
instructions
the plaintiffs gave him on 20 March 1992 conflicting with the
evidence he had given in his affidavit in that regard.  I think the
reliability
of McLaughlin's evidence is also seriously called into question by the fact
that he made no note of what transpired on
19 and 20 March 1992 despite notice
of the plaintiff's dissatisfaction with the settlement, nor any attempt at any
stage to obtain
a statement from Coleman with a view to corroborating his own
version of events.
<P>

167	I accept Coleman's evidence as a truthful account of what took place and
where McLaughlin's account is in conflict with Coleman's
evidence I reject it.

<P>

	<b>My Findings as to the course of events from 17 to 20 March 1992
(inclusive).</b>
<P>

168	I will now record my findings as to the course of events, stated in a way
that comes most easily to me.  I will then turn to
the specific findings sought
by the plaintiff.
<P>

169	Coleman introduced Brown and Freeman to McLaughlin.  McLaughlin and
Buckley's firm, McLaughlin &amp; Riordan, was retained by
the plaintiffs on 24
January 1991 to act in the Federal Court proceedings.  McLaughlin was
enthusiastic about the plaintiff's prospects
in the proceedings.  He told the
plaintiffs they had a good case.
<P>

170	McLaughlin arranged for affidavits by Brown, Freeman and others to be
prepared and filed.  The affidavits were drafted or settled
by counsel.
Documents were obtained on discovery.  The proceedings were set down for
Monday, 23 March 1992. 
<P>

171	In the Federal Court proceedings, it was alleged that United Systems had
used formulae, wrongfully obtained from the plaintiffs,
for the manufacture of
products which it was marketing as its own.  An account of profits was sought.
United System's defence was
that the formulae they were using had been provided
by raw material suppliers and/or developed by United Systems such that the
plaintiffs
had no right or interest in relation to the formulae.  
<P>

172	In earlier proceedings in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court, United
Systems, as plaintiff, made similar assertions against
Seamez and others in
relation to products manufactured and marked by Seamez.  Those proceedings were
dormant. 
<P>

173	McLaughlin did not inspect the Supreme Court file, and inspected some only
of the papers held by the plaintiffs' previous solicitors,
and that not until
19 March 1992.  This delay occurrred notwithstanding that he knew about the
Equity proceedings at least by mid-June
1991, that McLaughlin had been
requested by counsel in October 1991 to find out about them and that, on his
own admission, he should
have done so. 
<P>

174	It was thought that there were deficiencies in the discovery provided by
the respondents in the Federal Court proceedings. 
Complaints culminated in an
order made on 9 March 1992 for supplementary discovery.  Asserted deficiencies
were raised in a letter
written by McLaughlin on 18 March 1992.
<P>

175	At a conference with Jacobson on 17 March 1992, Jacobson formed the view
that Brown's affidavit was not genuinely his own and
that there was a further
problem arising from Brown and Freeman, both of whom were proposed witnesses,
having been present together
when Brown's affidavit was settled.  On the
evening of 17 March 1992, Jacobson informed Brender and McLaughlin of his views
and of
his intention to obtain a ruling from the president of the Bar Council
as to whether it would be inappropriate for him to return
his brief.  
<P>

176	McLaughlin asserts that, on the same evening, he spoke to Brown about
Jacobson's imminent departure from the case and the problems
about the case
mentioned by Jacobson, and recommended in strong terms that Brown settle the
case.  McLaughlin asserts that he repeated
his settlement advice to Brown at a
conference on 18 March 1992.  Brown denies that any such advice was given at
that stage.  McLaughlin
says that Brown's response to the advice was to find an
alternative Queen's Counsel and to proceed with the hearing.  It is common
ground, therefore, that as at 18 March 1992, the plaintiffs wished to proceed
with the hearing rather than settle, irrespective of
whatever problems may have
been brought to their attention at that stage.
<P>

177	Brender did not withdraw from the case at any stage.  However, he indicated
that he did not feel sufficiently experienced to
conduct such a case on his own
without a leader.
<P>

178	McLaughlin set about looking for a replacement for Jacobson and persisted
in that endeavour until 20 March 1992.
<P>

179	Notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned by Jacobson to which I have
referred and the existence of certain notes made by Brown
which had recently
come to light (and which were thought to be at odds with affidavit evidence
filed by Brown in the Equity proceedings),
McLaughlin believed that the
plaintiff had a slightly better than 50% chance of succeeding in the Federal
Court proceedings.
<P>

180	On the morning of 19 March 1992, McLaughlin had a meeting with Brown and
Coleman at his office.  The meeting was conducted in
a light-hearted mood.  In
relation to Jacobson's concern about Brown not being aux fait with the
technical material in his affidavit,
Brown and Coleman assured McLaughlin that
the concern was unfounded and that Brown would be ready for cross-examination
on his affidavit
at the trial.  Brown proffered an explanation for the notes
relating to the Equity proceedings.  There was no discussion of settlement,
nor
any suggestion that the case could not proceed.
<P>

181	On Friday morning 20 March 1992, McLaughlin telephoned Coleman, saying the
plaintiffs could not win because both barristers
had left the case.
<P>

182	Later in the day, a meeting took place at McLaughlin's office attended by
Brown and Coleman.  On this occasion, there was no
jocularity.  McLaughlin
repeated that both barristers had left the case and that Seamez had to settle
because it could not win. 
Coleman asked about the possibility of an
adjournment.  McLaughlin said that was not possible and that the case could be
settled
"on a walkaway basis", with the $30,000, paid into court by Seamez as
security for costs, going to the other side for their costs.
 Brown's response
was one of anger.  McLaughlin said that if he could find other counsel it would
cost $30,000 to brief them over
the weekend.  Brown requested McLaughlin to
obtain new counsel and have them apply for an adjournment.  McLaughlin said
they might
obtain an adjournment but only until the Tuesday which would not
help, and that, if the plaintiffs went on with the case, it would
cost them
$250,000.  (That would have been for the costs of both sides, assuming the
plaintiffs lost).  Brown asked McLaughlin to
apply for an adjournment and to
find new counsel regardless of the cost.  McLaughlin continued to urge
settlement in strong terms,
now adding that the settlement would not stop the
plaintiffs from taking further proceedings if United Systems continued to sell
the products in question.
<P>

183	On the way to Seamez's factory after the meeting, Brown told Coleman that
he wanted to go on with the case and that his major
concern was to protect
Seamez's products from exploitation by United Systems.
<P>

184	At this stage, Brown's state of mind (which I impute to Seamez) was that,
despite the difficulties mentioned by McLaughlin,
he wished to proceed with the
case rather than settle on the terms outlined by McLaughlin.
<P>

185	In the middle of the day, on 20 March 1992, McLaughlin telephoned the
factory and told Brown that the other side had agreed
to a settlement for
$20,000 rather than $30,000.  McLaughlin then told Coleman on the telephone
that a defamation writ for $300,000
had been taken out against Brown and a
Mareva injunction, both of which would be served before court on Monday unless
the matter
was settled.  The Mareva injunction, according to what McLaughlin
told Coleman, would prevent Brown from dealing with any assets
so that he would
be unable to continue in business.  (That was, a considerable overstatement of
the effect of a Mareva injunction.
 Coleman was not familiar with the remedy -
being a criminal lawyer - and was not in a position to know that the effect of
such an
injunction had been overstated.)  
<P>

186	Coleman communicated to Brown what he had been told by McLaughlin.  He then
told McLaughlin (in Brown's presence) that the money
did not concern Brown, and
that Brown was more concerned about protecting his products and stopping United
Systems from manufacturing
them.  
<P>

187	No defamation proceedings of the kind mentioned by McLaughlin had in fact
been instituted, nor had there been any application
for a Mareva injunction
against Seamez or Brown.  
<P>

188	A letter, sent by facsimile transmission at about 2.00 pm on 20 March 1992,
shows that McLaughlin genuinely understood from
his conversation with Brown and
Coleman that he had instructions to settle for up to $30,000.  However, the
letter does not show,
one way or the other, what instructions were given in
relation to further terms for any such settlement, nor even McLaughlin's
understanding
of such instructions.
<P>

189	Following communication between McLaughlin and Chris Brown (solicitor for
United Systems), a draft deed was sent by Chris Brown
to McLaughlin.  At a
second meeting, on 20 March 1992 in Mr McLaughlin's office, attended this time
by Brown, Freeman and Coleman,
the draft deed was discussed.
<P>

190	Materially, the effect of the deed was that United Systems and its
associates were released from any liability for any past
infringements of
Seamez's rights in relation to products marked by United Systems or their
associates to date.  As to the future,
the plaintiffs were precluded from
preventing any future infringement by United Systems or their associates of any
rights which the
plaintiffs might otherwise have had in relation to products
marketed by United Systems or their associates to date.
<P>

191	In these respects, the draft deed ran counter to McLaughlin's statement to
Brown at the first meeting on 20 March 1992 that
a settlement, as urged by
McLaughlin, would not stop the plaintiffs taking further proceedings if United
Systems continued to sell
the plaintiffs' products.  It also ran counter to
Brown's primary concern, communicated to McLaughlin, which was to prevent
United
Systems from manufacturing products which Brown asserted utilised
formulae which were the property of the plaintiffs.  (In these
respects, the
final version of the deed executed by the plaintiffs later on 20 March 1992,
was in materially the same terms.)
<P>

192	The tone of the meeting was set by an opening statement by Coleman that
Brown was not happy about settling and would prefer
to fight it out in court,
but that he was willing to listen to McLaughlin's advice.  McLaughlin repeated
his advice to settle the
case and did so in strong terms.  Coleman then had a
brief opportunity to read through the draft deed.  He told Brown and Freeman
that the draft constituted a total surrender, and they should not sign it
because it gave away Brown's rights to his products.  Coleman
told McLaughlin
that Brown would never agree to a settlement in which he had to give up his
rights to his products.  He said the
deed would have to be confined to the
products which were the subject of the proceedings, but should exclude the Beer
Line 1 and
2 cleaner products altogether; the settlement should apply only up
to the date of the deed, so that Brown would be able to commence
proceedings
against United Systems if they continued to produce the products in question;
there should be mutual releases; and there
should be a clause requiring
withdrawal of the defamation suit and the Mareva injunction.
<P>

193	There was then discussion on the telephone between McLaughlin and the other
side.  Buckley brought in a revised draft deed which
had been received.
McLaughlin told the other side that the second draft was unsatisfactory.
<P>

194	Brown reaffirmed that he wanted the deed confined to the products which
were the subject of the proceedings, and that the Beer
Line cleaner product
should be omitted altogether because it was non-negotiable.  McLaughlin told
Brown that the other side had agreed
that the Beer Line cleaner product would
not be included in the deed.  McLaughlin also said that the other side had
agreed that releases
should be mutual and that the defamation proceedings and
the Mareva injunction should be withdrawn.
<P>

195	Brown then became very emotional and said he wanted the weekend to think
the matter over.  Coleman asked McLaughlin to confirm
that the other side had
agreed to omitting the Beer Line cleaner product, that the plaintiffs would
drop their claim in relation
to the products which were the subject of the
proceedings but only to the date of the agreement, and that the plaintiffs
could start
fresh proceedings against United Systems in the future using the
evidence already obtained.  McLaughlin said that was the agreement
which the
other side was prepared to sign.  
<P>

196	Brown still sought time to consider.  Buckley said the deed had to be
signed that night or the deal was off.
<P>

197	McLaughlin then asked Buckley to confirm to Brown that United Systems were
settling on the basis that they were forgiven for
past infringements concerning
the products specified in the Federal Court proceedings, that the Beer Line
cleaner product was not
part of the agreement, and that, if United Systems
manufactured Seamez's products in the future, the plaintiffs would be free to
pursue them using the same evidence.  Buckley said that was right.  
<P>

198	The current draft of the deed did not so provide.  It did not exempt the
Beer Line cleaner product from the release by the plaintiffs
concerning any
past conduct by the respondents; and it did not preserve the plaintiffs'
capacity to sue United Systems if that company
persisted in marketing products
which it was currently marketing and in which the plaintiffs claimed to have an
interest.  Further
amendment was required to incorporate what it was said
United Systems was prepared to agree to. 
<P>

199	At this point, Coleman left the meeting to keep another appointment.
<P>

200	A final version of the deed arrived from the other side.  McLaughlin
asserts that he read out the operative part of the deed
to Brown and Freeman.
They deny that.  The deed was executed by Brown and Freeman.  Brown says he
signed the deed "under protest".
 That is also disputed.
<P>

201	These last mentioned matters of contention do not matter.  The deed was
unintelligible to a lay person or at least  very easily
misunderstood.  Coleman
and Brown had made it clear what the plaintiffs' requirements were.  The deed,
neither in its draft form
nor in its final form, did not answer those
requirements.  Materially, the Beer Line cleaner product was not exempt from
the release
by the plaintiffs in relation to any infringement of their
interests to date; and the deed did not preserve the plaintiffs' entitlement
to
sue in relation to any future infringement of their interests if the
respondents continued to market any product currently marketed
by them of which
the plaintiffs complained.  Neither McLaughlin nor Buckley assert that before
the deed was executed they informed
Brown and Freeman that the deed in its
final form fell short of the settlement they had said was available in these
respects.  Brown
and Freeman would not have executed the deed but for their
reliance on the statements made by McLaughlin and Buckley as to what the
terms
of the settlement were to be.  Those assurances were not met by the deed which
McLaughlin invited them - and impliedly advised
them - to execute.
<P>

	<b>Findings as to breach of duty sought by the plaintiffs</b>
<P>

202	I now turn to the findings sought by the plaintiffs in relation to breach
of duty.  In ruling on each request for a finding,
I bring to account the
findings I have made as to the course of events between 17 and 20 March
1992.
<P>

<b><i>203	(i)  Failing to obtain full and proper discovery from the respondents
in the litigation such that the applicants' case was not
adequately prepared on
the issue of documents held by the respondents regarding the chemical formulae
of their products and also
regarding profits made by them from sales of their
products.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  It is questionable as to whether the action taken was deficient.
But, it is not shown that more vigorous action would
have had any effect.  The
consequence is speculative.  There might have been no further documents.  The
evidence does not disclose
a serious possibility that there were.  It is not
shown that further documents were necessary for proof of the plaintiffs'
case.
<P>

204	<b>(ii)</b>	(Not pressed).
<P>

<b><i>205	(iii)  Advising the applicants that the litigation should be settled
or compromised only on 19 March 1992, one business day before
the commencement
of the hearing of the litigation or even on 18 March 1992, only two days before
the commencement.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  A view about settlement often emerges during the final stages of
preparation for trial.  I am not satisfied that, in
this case, the lateness of
the advice involved breach of duty in not advancing the preparation programme
in such a way that the same
view about settlement would have emerged
earlier.
<P>

206	<b><i>(iv)	Failing to obtain counsel's advice concerning the appellants'
prospects for success in the litigation</i></b>.
<P>

Rejected.  Generally speaking, there is no obligation to obtain counsel's
advice on settlement.  There was no special reason for
doing so in this
case.
<P>

207	<b>(v)</b>	(Not pressed.)
<P>

<b><i>208	(vi)	Failing to inspect the documents concerning the 1986 Equity
Division proceedings at the time of initial instructions, in
October 1991 or at
any time prior to 18 March 1992.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  I refer to my earlier findings and observations on this matter.
(Whether the breach had any consequence is another matter.)
<P>

209	<b><i>(vii)	Failing to obtain the advice of counsel concerning the 1986
Equity Division proceedings documents</i></b>.
<P>

Rejected.  The solicitor was competent to evaluate them
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>210	(viii)  Failing to inform the plaintiffs that leading counsel had
returned his brief until the evening of Thursday 19 March 1992
or alternatively
on 18 March 1992.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  I am not satisfied there was any material delay.
<P>

<b><i>211	(ix)	Failing to advise the plaintiffs adequately or at all of the
consequences and circumstances of leading counsel returning
his
brief.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  McLaughlin should have advised the plaintiffs that Brender could be
asked to conduct the case despite his misgivings, and
that, if other senior
counsel could not be found in time, the Court was likely to grant an
adjournment which would be sufficient
to enable that to be done (albeit with a
penalty as to costs).
<P>

<b><i>212	(x)  Failing to properly consider and assess the applicants'
affidavit evidence, particularly that of Baden John Brown, prior
to the week
before the commencement of the hearing of the litigation.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  Final preparation in the week before trial was unexceptionable in
this case.  The view formed by Jacobson about difficulties
in the case arose at
that time.  It is not unusual that difficulties are perceived in the course of
final preparation shortly before
the trial.
<P>

<b><i>213	(xi)  Failing to properly obtain and consider the affidavit evidence
of Freeman in good time prior to the commencement of the
litigation.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  See (x).
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>214	(xii)  Failing to apply for an adjournment of the hearing of the
litigation on Wednesday 18 March, Thursday 19 March or Friday
20 March 1992
when instructed by the plaintiffs to do so, or failing to seek instructions to
do so.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  In my view that should have been done; and with good prospects of
success, sufficient to enable other silk to be found
and briefed.
<P>

<b><i>215	</i></b>(<b><i>xiii)  Failing to heed the plaintiffs' instructions to
make an application to adjourn the hearing of the litigation by instructing
Jacobson or Brender of counsel or by instructing other appropriate
counsel.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  See (xii).
<P>

<b><i>216	(xiv)  Advising the applicants on 20 March 1992 that both their
counsel were unable to appear at the hearing of the litigation
when in fact
Brender was available to appear at the hearing of the litigation.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  Brender was available.  McLaughlin told the plaintiffs he was not.
McLaughlin was mistaken.  He should have taken more
care to inform himself
accurately of Brender's position.
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>217	(xv)  Advising Mr Brown on 20 March 1992 that the applicants would
not be able to get an adjournment of the hearing of the litigation
and the
applicants would be forced on.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  See (xii).
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>218	(xvi)  Failing to take any adequate steps to retain alternative
counsel to Jacobson during the period 18 March 1992 to 20 March
1992.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  It is not shown that McLaughlin could have done more than he did in
this respect.
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>219	(xvii)  Placing the plaintiffs in a position on 20 March 1992 whereby
the plaintiffs had no alternative other than to settle the
litigation on very
disadvantageous terms.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  This draft finding is insufficiently specific to warrant a response
from me.
<P>

<b><i>220	(xviii)  Representing to the plaintiffs on 20 March 1992 that the
respondents to the litigation had taken out a Mareva injunction
against them
and would serve the injunction before the commencement of the hearing on Monday
23 March 1992 when to the knowledge
of McLaughlin the respondents had not done
so and did not ever intend to do so.</i></b>
<P>

I do not make this finding but I make a related finding.  Whether McLaughlin
was told a Mareva injunction had been obtained but
not yet activated by
service, or would be applied for is neither here nor there.  The threat would
have been the same.  After the
passage of 8 years, it may be that Chris Brown
told McLaughlin that he intended to apply for such an injunction (in
conjunction with
a proposed defamation suit), and that both men have forgotten
that.  I see nothing, therefore, in the assertion that McLaughlin dishonestly
misrepresented to Coleman that such an injunction was on the way.  What is
material is that McLaughlin told Coleman - who was unfamiliar
with such
injunctions - (to be passed on to the plaintiffs) that the injunction would
have the effect of closing down the plaintiff's
business.  That was not so and
McLaughlin ought to have known it was not so.  This was a serious breach of
duty.  It must have caused
the plaintiffs grave concern about proceeding with
the case.
<P>

<b><i>221	(xix)  Representing to the plaintiffs that Mr Robert Fulton had
commenced defamation proceedings against Mr Brown and that the
process for
those proceedings would be served on Mr Brown before the commencement of the
hearing of the litigation on 23 March 1992
when to the knowledge of McLaughlin
Mr Fulton had not done so. </i></b>
<P>

Rejected. For the same reasons as in (xviii), I see nothing in the assertion
that McLaughlin dishonestly misrepresented to Coleman
that such a writ was on
the way.  In this instance, however, there it ends.  (Further, Brown said he
was not troubled by the threat
of such a defamation action.)
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>222	(xx)  Representing to the plaintiffs that if they did not settle the
litigation that they would be required to pay $250,000 in
cash to the
respondents by 9.30 am on 23 March 1992, prior to the hearing of the
litigation, when he had no reasonable grounds for
believing that to be
true.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  Coleman does not support this finding.  It depends on accepting
evidence I am not taking to be reliable.
<P>

223	<b>(xxi)</b>  Not pressed.
<P>

<b><i>224	(xxii)  Failing to explain at all or in the alternative properly, the
terms of the deed proffered by the respondents to settle
the
litigation.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  The terms of the deed were not explained in the important respects I
have mentioned.
<P>

<b><i>225	(xxiii)  Representing to the plaintiffs that the terms of the deed
did not affect the plaintiffs' rights to commence proceedings
after 20 March
1992 against the respondents to protect their interests in their products.
</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  This is cognate with the point in (xxii).
<P>

<b><i>226	(xxiv)  Failing to advise the plaintiffs that under the provisions of
the deed the respondents obtained a release in relation
to the use of any of
their products at any time. </i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  As for (xxiii).
<P>

227	<b>(xxv)</b>  Not pressed.
<P>

<b><i>228	(xxvi) Failing to advise the plaintiffs that the beer line cleaning
products were not excluded from the settlement.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  As for (xxiii).
<P>

	
<P>

<b><i>229	(xxvii) During the period 17 March to 20 March 1992 failing to advise
the plaintiffs that the litigation was not fully or properly
prepared for
hearing.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  This is a reference to the situation in relation to discovery.  See
(i).
<P>

<b><i>230	(xxviii)  Failing to advise the plaintiffs as at 16 March 1992 that
the litigation was not ready for hearing as a result of the
defendants'
breaches of duty.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  As for (xvii).
<P>

<b><i>231	(xxix)  Advising the plaintiffs to compromise the litigation upon a
payment to the respondents of $20,000.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  It is not shown that such advice was so wrong as to constitute a
breach of duty.  Other terms on which the case was settled
and the absence of
other terms are a different matter.
<P>

<b><i>232	(xxx)Failing to advise the plaintiffs during the period 18 March to
20 March 1992 of McLaughlin's view that the applicants' chances
of success in
the litigation were better than 50%.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.  This was a serious deficiency in McLaughlin's advice concerning
settlement.  McLaughlin's opinion in that regard was a
highly relevant
consideration.  To fail to communicate that view when advising on settlement
was a breach of duty. 
<P>

	<b>My findings as to consequences of breach of duty</b>
<P>

233	The plaintiffs have specified the consequential findings they seek.  I have
upheld some of the findings of breach of duty which
were sought by the
plaintiffs and I have rejected others.
<P>

234	Before coming to the consequential findings sought by the plaintiffs, I
think it would be useful for me to state what I regard
as the consequences of
my findings as to the course of events and of my findings as to breach of
duty.
<P>

235	I find that the plaintiffs were until 20 March 1992 opposed to settlement
altogether.  They wanted the case to be adjourned,
a new silk to be briefed and
the case to proceed.  On 20 March 1992, they were persuaded to settle the case
on certain terms.  Of
the factors which led them to change their mind, some had
to do with asserted difficulties about successfully prosecuting the case.
Others had to do with the terms on which the proceedings could be, would be and
were being settled.
<P>

236	The following considerations led them to decide to settle in porinciple
rather than press on.  Each constituted a breach of
contractual duty on the
part of the present defendants.
<P>

(a)	Statements that the plaintiffs could not win, whereas McLaughlin was of the
view that there was a better than 50:50 chance of
winning.
<P>

(b)	Statements that an application for adjournment would be unsuccessful and/or
futile, whereas an adjournment would very likely
have been granted, sufficient
to enable a new leader to be found and briefed.
<P>

(c)	Statements that both counsel had withdrawn from the case whereas Brender
had not.
<P>

(d)	The statement that a threatened injunction would prevent the plaintiffs
from continuing in business.
<P>

237	The following considerations led the plaintiffs to settle on the terms in
the deed whereas otherwise they would not have done
so.  Again, each
constituted a breach of contractual duty on the part of the present
defendants:
<P>

(a)	Failure to correct or qualify statements that a settlement would include
the two features now mentioned.
<P>

(b)	Statements which specified or implied that the release, given by the
plaintiffs in the deed in relation to any past infringements
by United Systems
or its associates, did not include the Beer Line cleaner product.
<P>

(c)	Statements which specified or implied that the deed would not prevent the
plaintiffs from bringing proceedings against United
Systems and their
associates in relation to future conduct, if United Systems or its associates
continued to market products contrary
to the plaintiffs' claimed rights and
interests.
<P>

238	I have for convenience drawn a distinction between considerations which
induced the plaintiffs to settle at all and considerations
which induced them
to settle on the terms in the deed.  In another sense, the distinction is
artificial.  The deed embodied the terms
on which settlement was available.
McLaughlin had endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to improve those terms.  It may be
assumed that settlement
on more favourable (or less unfavourable) terms was not
available.  It may therefore be concluded - and I so find - that all of the
considerations to which I have referred materially contributed to and caused
the plaintiffs' decision to settle the case as they
did rather than continue
with it.
<P>

239	As a result of the present defendants' breaches of contractual duty, the
plaintiffs thereby lost the benefit of the claims they
made in the Federal
Court proceedings, incurred the obligations they incurred under the deed, and
lost the rights they gave up in
the deed.
<P>

	<b>Consequential findings sought by the plaintiff</b>
<P>

240	I turn now to the schedule of consequential findings sought by the
plaintiffs.  I will deal with each in turn.  I will not include
the references
to specified breaches which were provided and which are recorded earlier in
this judgment.
<P>

241	<b><i>(1) The plaintiffs would not have signed the deed of 20 March 1992 to
settle the Federal Court proceedings</i></b>.
<P>

Upheld.
<P>

242	<b><i>(2) The plaintiffs would have continued to conduct a Federal Court
proceedings to judgment</i></b>.
<P>

Upheld.
<P>

<b><i>243	(3) Alternatively to (2), the plaintiffs would have had an
opportunity to consider settlement of the Federal Court proceedings
calmly, in
a timely manner, and with the benefit of considered opinions of their solicitor
and senior counsel.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  This finding is based on the contention that earlier preparation
would have shown up perceived difficulties in the plaintiffs'
case and would,
accordingly, have resulted in earlier and less pressured consideration of
possible settlement.  For the reasons given
earlier in this judgment, the
premise on which this finding proceeds has not been established.
<P>

<b><i>244	(4)  The plaintiffs would not have settled the Federal Court
proceedings on the terms they did.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.
<P>

<b><i>245	(5)  The plaintiffs would not have lost the opportunity to have their
Federal Court proceedings determined by a judge of that
court.</i></b>
<P>

Upheld.
<P>

246	<b><i>(6)  Alternatively to (5), the plaintiffs would not have incurred the
costs, alternatively, a significant proportion of the costs,
of the Federal
Court proceedings</i></b>.
<P>

Rejected.  I reject this finding on the assumption that it relates to the
plaintiffs' costs.  This finding rests on the same premise
as (3) above.
<P>

247	<b><i>(7)  The plaintiffs would not have incurred the sum of $20,000 paid
to the respondents in the Federal Court proceedings</i></b>.
<P>

Upheld.  I take this draft finding to mean that the plaintiffs would not, as a
term of a settlement at that stage, have agreed to
the payment to the
respondents of that amount out of the moneys paid into court by the plaintiffs
as security for the respondents'
costs.   I make this finding because, but for
breaches of contractual obligation by the respondents, the plaintiffs would not
have
agreed to settle the proceedings at all.  Of course, depending on the
outcome of a hearing of the Federal Court proceedings, the
plaintiffs might
ultimately have become liable for the respondents' costs, including the moneys
paid into court as security for such
costs.
<P>

<b><i>248	(8)  The plaintiffs would have instructed the defendants in
definitive terms to apply for an adjournment of the Federal Court
proceedings
if they had known or thought that there could be any doubt that their
instructions to run the Federal Court proceedings
did not necessarily include
the making of all or any applications to adjourn them (the Federal Court
proceedings would have been
adjourned.)</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  Unravelling this draft finding is not warranted.
<P>

249	(<b><i>9)  The plaintiffs would have had the opportunity overnight or over
the weekend further to reflect upon and to confer about the terms
of the deed
of 20 March 1992 before being required to decide whether or not to sign
it</i></b>.
<P>

Rejected.  I do not find that having the opportunity of considering the
proposed settlement overnight or over the weekend would
have made any
difference to the outcome or might have done.
<P>

<b><i>250	(10)  The plaintiffs would have instructed the defendants to take all
such steps as were necessary or sufficient  to complete
discovery in the
Federal Court proceedings in the ways referred to in McLaughlin's (unsent)
letter of 20 March 1992 addressed to
the solicitors for the respondents in the
Federal Court proceedings.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  For the reasons given earlier in this judgment, it is not
established that there was any remediable deficiency in discovery

<P>

<b><i>251	(11)	The plaintiffs would not have incurred the costs of the present
litigation.</i></b>
<P>

Rejected.  The only possible basis for this finding would be the assertion of
failure to prepare for trial earlier than occurred,
a finding sought and
rejected.
<P>

	<b>Breach of fiduciary duty</b>
<P>

252	It is submitted that, in advising and urging the plaintiffs to settle on
the terms available, McLaughlin preferred his own interests
to those of the
plaintiffs.
<P>

253	The submission depends on an anterior finding that a failure to manage the
case diligently would have been disclosed, to the
defendants' detriment, if the
case was not settled.  The asserted deficiencies in management of the case were
in relation to discovery
and earlier preparation for trial.  I have held that
there is no substance in either of these criticisms.  The foundation for a case
based on breach of fiduciary obligation, therefore falls away.
<P>

254	For these reasons I find no actionable breach of fiduciary obligation.
