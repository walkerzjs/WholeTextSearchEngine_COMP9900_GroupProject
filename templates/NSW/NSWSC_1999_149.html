<b>4106/98 -   LUCIE JANE DAY by her tutor JILL ANNE DAY V PERPETUAL TRUSTEE
COMPANY LIMITED as Executor of the Estate of Valmai Grafton
Marshall
deceased</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   These proceedings are to construe the will of the late
Valmai Marshall, who died on 5 January 1998.
<P>

2	Mrs Marshall made her last will and testament on 4 May 1990.
<P>

3	Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the will are as follows:
<P>

"3.	I GIVE all my furniture, pictures, prints, musical instruments, television
receivers, video recorders, radio receivers, electrical
appliances,
furnishings, jewellery, clothing, ornaments, china, glass, books and other
household effects to my only child, my daughter
JILL ANNE DAY provided that she
shall survive me by more than thirty (30) days.
<P>

4.	I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH the residue of my real and personal estate
whatsoever wheresoever unto my Trustee UPON TRUST to pay
thereout all my debts
funeral and testamentary expenses and all duties and taxes payable in
consequence of my death and I direct
my Trustee TO HOLD the residue thereof
(herein called my "residuary estate") upon the following trusts:
<P>

A.	TO PAY the income arising from three-fifths of my residuary estate to my
said daughter JILL ANNE DAY during her lifetime and
TO HOLD the capital
comprising the said three-fifths of my residuary estate, subject to the said
life interest of my said daughter
UPON TRUST for such of my grandchildren as
shall survive me and attain the age of twenty one (21) years if more than one
in equal
shares absolutely.
<P>

B.	To hold two-fifths of my residuary estate UPON TRUST for such of my
grandchildren as shall survive me and attain the age of twenty
one (21) years,
if more than one, in equal shares absolutely.
<P>

C.	If no grandchild or grandchildren of mine shall survive me and attain the
age of twenty one (21) years my Trustee shall hold
the whole of my residuary
estate UPON TRUST for my said daughter JILL ANNE DAY absolutely provided she
shall have survived me by
more than thirty (30) days and be living at the date
of death of my last surviving grandchild.
<P>

5.	IF neither my said daughter nor any grandchild of mine shall attain a vested
interest in my estate my Trustee shall hold any
residuary estate UPON TRUST for
my great-grandchildren (if any) in equal shares and if I have no
great-grandchildren my Trustee shall
hold my residuary estate UPON TRUST for
the Cancer Research Foundation for research into the causes, treatment and cure
of cancer
in humans.  "
<P>

4	Mrs Marshall had been twice married, the first time, it would appear, to a Mr
Williams, and there were two children of that marriage,
Pamela and Judith.  She
then married Mr Marshall and there was one child of that union, Jill Anne
Day.
<P>

5	The will was made by a well-known and experienced Sydney solicitor. 
<P>

6	The plaintiff is the only child of Jill Anne Day and is now aged seventeen.
She says that on the true construction of the will
she is the only person to
take under clauses 4A and 4B.  The executor put before the Court arguments to
show that all the grandchildren
of the deceased, of whom there are seven, take
the gift given to the "grandchildren".
<P>

7	The first matter that I had to decide during the running of the case was
whether to admit extrinsic evidence.  The extrinsic evidence
was to the effect
that the solicitor who made the will was only aware of one child.  He did not
know the testatrix had been previously
married.  He does not have any papers
that will assist, but he said he could not understand why the will in clause 3
uses the words
"my only child".   In any event he certainly drew the will on
the basis that that was the only advice that the testatrix gave him.
<P>

8	The second piece of evidence was that the testatrix, shortly before she died,
arranged for a new will to be made, in which she
was to leave all her property
to Jill Anne Day and the present plaintiff. Although a draft was prepared, the
testatrix died before
she could sign it.
<P>

9	The rules as to the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in cases of this sort
are quite clear, though there is sometimes difficulty
in applying them to given
facts.  The rules are:
<P>

1.	If there is only one person who exactly answers the description in the will,
no extrinsic evidence is admitted.  (An example
is <b>National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children v Scottish National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1915%5d%20AC%20207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1915] AC 207).</a>
<P>

2.	If no-one exactly answers the description, evidence of surrounding
circumstances will be admissible, but not direct declarations
of intention (eg
<b>Bernasconi v Atkinson </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1853/83.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1853] EngR 83</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281853%29%2010%20Hare%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1853) 10 Hare 345</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=68%20ER%20959" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">68 ER 959).</a>
<P>

3.	If two or more people exactly answer the description, there is an
equivocation and extrinsic evidence including direct declarations
of intention
are receivable (eg <b>Doe d Morgan v Morgan </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1832/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1832] EngR 79</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281832%29%201%20Cr%20%26%20M%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1832) 1 Cr &amp; M 235</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=149%20ER%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">149
ER 387</a>, where the testator left property to his nephew Morgan Morgan, but had
two nephews of that name.  See also as to equivocations <b>Charter v Charter
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%20LR%207%20HL%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) LR 7 HL 364</a> and <b>Re Newman </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1967/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] VicRp 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20VR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] VR 201).</a>
<P>

10	Mr Haffenden, for the executor, says that the extrinsic evidence is not
admissible.  First of all, he says there is no ambiguity
in the word
"grandchild" and, if there is no ambiguity, no extrinsic evidence is admitted.

<P>

11	However, when one sees the words "only child" used in clause 3 and then a
reference to "said daughter" in clause 4A followed
immediately by a gift to
grandchildren, one suspects that the word "grandchildren" may mean issue of
that daughter.   Accordingly,
I thought there was sufficient ambiguity to merit
considering extrinsic evidence.
<P>

12	The next question is, what sort of extrinsic evidence?
<P>

13	Mr Haffenden submitted that if one finds there is an ambiguity, one can let
in what he calls "armchair" evidence, that is, the
facts and circumstances that
were known to the testatrix as she sat in her armchair making out the
instructions for her will.
<P>

14	Mr Thomson, for the plaintiff, says that the matter goes further, that there
is really an equivocation.  He submits that the
word "grandchild" which, in
itself, is unambiguous, in the peculiar circumstances of this will could
equally apply to two or more
persons;  cf <b>Re Hubbuck </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%20P%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] P 129.</a>
<P>

15	Mr Haffenden says this cannot be a case of equivocation because <b>Theobald
on Wills </b>14th ed (Stevens &amp; Sons, London, 1982) p 215 rightly says that
there are three requirements for  an equivocation to exist one
of which is
that:
<P>

"The will, when construed as a whole with the aid of any extrinsic evidence
admissible under the armchair principle, does not show
to which of the persons
or things the testator was referring."
<P>

He says the will did not get to that state.  
<P>

16	I think it probably does, because one does not know, just sitting in the
testatrix's armchair, whether she meant the children
of Jill Anne Day or the
children of all her children, even after one looks at the extrinsic evidence
admitted under the armchair
principle.
<P>

17	I thus admitted the evidence in the affidavits which are the subject of
genuine objection to the evidence by Mr Haffenden and
the particular objections
which he made in the document MIO1 and which have been left with the papers.
<P>

18	It seems to me that, even with that evidence, there is not sufficient here
to enable the plaintiff to succeed.
<P>

19	Normally the word "grandchild" means all the children of a testatrix's
children.  
<P>

20	Secondly, one can see that the testatrix did have in mind that she may be
benefiting grandchildren that were yet to be born and
by definition, at the
time she made her will, of whom she did not know.
<P>

21	Mr Thomson refers to <b>Harris v Ashdown</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 193.</a>  I thank
him for the reference, but I do not think it takes the matter very much
further.
<P>

22	I see nothing in the scheme of the will which is of assistance.  Indeed, it
is a strange will because there does not appear to
be any rhyme nor reason for
splitting the estate into a 60 per cent share and a 40 per cent share under
clauses 4A and 4B.  
<P>

23	I thought for a while that perhaps the plaintiff took under clause 4A but
not 4B.  But it would be almost impossible to say that
the word "grandchildren"
was used in a different sense in the two parts of clause 4.  
<P>

24	One can see how under clause 4A it would be natural for the grandchildren
who descended from Jill Anne Day to take after their
mother's death, but there
is no such case applicable to clause 4B.  
<P>

25	Really, the only argument of strength is that the testatrix was proceeding
on the basis that, insofar as she was concerned, she
only had one child and
that was Jill Anne Day.  
<P>

26	Then when one passes to clause 4A the testatrix refers to "that child" and
so on the basis that she only has one child the descendants
of that child must
be her grandchildren. 
<P>

27	However, there are other possible scenarios.  It is clear that the testatrix
did not think in 1990 that her only child was a
person to whom she should give
the whole of her estate.  It would seem that there were some difficulties in
that relationship.  She,
accordingly, thought, as a lot of testators tend to
think, that if they have problems with their relationships with their children
somehow or other their grandchildren will be better.  That sort of thought fits
in equally with the possibility that the descendants
of all her children were
to be the subject of her benefaction as the thought that only those descendants
of her named child should
take. 
<P>

28	One must add to the general circumstances of the width of the word
"grandchild" the consideration that if it was intended that
Jill Anne Day would
take 60 per cent of the estate for life and the descendants of Jill Anne Day
would take the residue, so much
now and so much on the death of the mother,
surely the testatrix would just have said so instead of expressing herself in
such a
convoluted way.  
<P>

29	Thus, in my view the persons who take the residue are all the grandchildren
of the testatrix.
<P>

30	Accordingly, the Court declares that upon the true construction of the last
will and testament of Valmai Marshall and in the
circumstances that have
happened, the references to "grandchildren" in clause 4 mean Lucie Jane Day,
Peter Anthony Maguire, Suzanne
Pamela Lockyer, Judy Anne Kenny, Joanne
McLennan, Kristina O'Connor and Scott Andrew McLennan.
<P>

31	I order that the costs of the plaintiff and the costs of the defendant in
each case on the indemnity basis be paid out of the
estate.
<P>

	                             oOo
