<b><u>FEWSON PTY LIMITED v MARTIN DAVID WELLS &amp; ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Issue</b>
<P>

1   	The question to be decided is whether a lease between
Fewson Pty Limited (Fewson) and the defendants, Martin David Wells (Wells)
and
Norman Wright (Wright) of part of property 54 Duffy Avenue, Thornleigh
contained a clause as follows:
<P>

38.	This lease may be terminated at any time by the lessor or the lessee
providing three (3) months notice in writing is given.
<P>

The landlord or its agent (Mr Clark) says the clause was included,  the tenants
say it was not.  The landlord puts in evidence the
original lease with a page
including the clause attached.  The tenants put in evidence what they allege is
a copy of the lease they
signed which does not include the attached page.  One
side has changed the document.  This is the only real issue.  There is now
no
real dispute as to whether one of the two notices of termination was valid if
clause 38 was included in the lease.  It does not
matter which one was valid as
all the landlord seeks is an order for possession.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	Mr Wright managed a commercial storage operation for
Storage Australia (Hornsby) Pty Limited.  That company decided late in
1998 to
close its Hornsby facility.  Mr Wright had come into contact with Mr Wells, who
was a customer of the Hornsby storage facility,
and they agreed to go into
business together, thinking that they would be able to take some of the Storage
Australia customers from
Hornsby with them.  To do this they needed to secure
premises as a matter of urgency and according to Mr Wright, needed security
for
at least twelve months.
<P>

3   	They made contact with Camelle Real Estate Pty Ltd
(Camelle) which company managed the Duffy Avenue property for Fewson.  It
appears this contact came about through Mr Wells inspecting a property at Pound
Road Hornsby, which Camelle had listed for rental
and when that property was
found to be unsatisfactory attention was directed to the Duffy Avenue property
and an inspection arranged
of it.  The defendants dealt through Mr Clark.  It
seems likely that discussions took place on 16 January 1999, but on whatever
date
Clark says that he told Wells and Wright that:
<P>

The lease has a three month demolition clause in it.  You would have to get out
on three months' notice.  You may get three months
in total at the property,
you may get six months or nine, perhaps you'll get twelve months out of it, but
I cannot make any promises.
 The owners are going to demolish the buildings on
the property and I understand the property will be rezoned.
<P>

4   	On 17 January Wells wrote to Camelle for the attention of
Mr Clark making an offer to rent part of the Duffy Avenue property
for $50,000
per annum.  That offer included the following clause:
<P>

We understand that the property is subject to a demolition clause, and that
three months' notice will be given to quit.  A minimum
rental period of twelve
months is offered.
<P>

Wright says that at a meeting on the site Clark said there was a demolition
clause and said:
<P>

You will get a minimum of twelve months with three months notice to quit once
the twelve months is up.  You will probably get to
stay from eighteen months to
two years, because I believe the EPA will object to the development, because of
contamination and the
council has yet to approve the building and rezoning
applications.  I also understand the Westleigh Action Group object to the
development
without widening the roads and improving the rail bridge.
<P>

and
<P>

These are the areas available in the property (indicating the sheds), work out
what area works for you best and then we make a proposal
to the owner.  You
will be here at least eighteen months to two years.  The property would be
demolished at some stage but as far
as I know there is no approval from council
yet.
<P>

Wright said that he then said: 
<P>

As long as we get a minimum twelve months with three months notice we have no
problem with that, what is a reasonable rent?
<P>

Clark denies saying the words attributed to him.
<P>

5   	It is accepted that there was subsequent discussions on 19
January with Mr Clark under which $65,000 was agreed for rent. 
It seems Wells
and Wright were allowed into possession early before signing the lease at least
for the purpose of showing the property
to prospective depositors or
customers.
<P>

6   	According to Mr Clark he instructed a member of the staff
of Camelle to prepare a lease and to re-type certain pro forma clauses
35, 36,
37, 38 and 39 which he had obtained from the plaintiff for insertion in the
lease, and also to insert a typed clause 40 into
the lease.  He says that was
done by the staff member and the lease was returned to him and that the lease
in evidence is that document
as typed after it was signed by Messrs. Wright and
Wells.  Only one copy of the lease was prepared.  The document is dated 28
January,
but it is accepted it was not signed until 29 or 30 January.  Mr Wells
picked up the lease from Camelle on 29 January or perhaps
on 30 January, and
shortly thereafter it was returned to Camelle duly signed by the tenants.  Of
clauses 35 to 39 included on the
separate page, if it were included, clause 35
conflicts with the lease because it assumes a longer term than 12 months.
Clause 36
related to insurance, clause 37 to security and clause 39 to
remediation.  The lease described the premises as "54 Duffy Avenue,
Thornleigh
(area J,K,L as per attached plan)".  The term of the lease was one year from 5
February 1999.  The document which the
landlord propounds as the lease
comprises the four A4 pages commercial lease document, the copyright of which
belongs to the Real
Estate Institute of New South Wales.  Those four pages are
each side of a double A4 page folded over, so that only one piece of paper
comprises the four yellow pages, together with three white sheets of paper, the
first containing clause 35 to 39, the second clause
40, which relates to motor
vehicle parking and the like, and the third being a plan of the Duffy Avenue
property showing various
areas.  Mr Wells said that the lease which he picked
up comprised only the material on the yellow paper, that he read it and took
it
to Mr Wright at Storage Australia, who asked him if he had read it, and he said
"it's what we asked for and it is what we got
with respect to the price and
term."  Wright said that he wanted to read it and he, Wright, took a photocopy
of the lease and Wells
retained the original.
<P>

7   	the defendants say on 1 February that they met at the
premises at Thornleigh with Mr Rorke and signed the lease in the presence
of Mr
Rorke, who witnessed it.  On 2 February Wells returned the lease to Mr Clark.
Mr Rorke, in affidavit evidence, said that the
document, when he witnessed the
signatures, comprised only the yellow pages.  He said that the two typewritten
pages and the plan
were not there.
<P>

8   	It is relevant to state that Mr Clark sent a copy of Mr
Wells' offer dated 17 January 1999 to Messrs. Bosco Seeto and Associates,
who
apparently acted as advisers to Fewson, and that Mr Seeto gave instructions
that a lease should be offered for twelve months
at $65,000, with "three months
notice to vacate for demolition".  He said that the rental agreement should be
prepared "similar to
the one that David Booth did for elsewhere in the same
building."
<P>

9   	On 8 February 1999 Mr Clark sent to Mr Liu, who is
apparently an employee of, or consultant to, Fewson, a fax stating in part
"attached are front and back pages of commercial lease, plus special clauses
you wanted inserted with plans of areas".  He sent copies
of the lease to the
defendants and a lease of part of the same premises to P.T. and J.E. Parker
Holdings Pty Limited.  That lease
to the Parker interests was for "areas F, G
and H as per annexure A."  The term of the lease was expressed to be "six
months (subject
to the conditions contained in clause 38)".  It is clear enough
therefore that so far as the Parker lease was concerned, a plan and
the
additional page of special conditions were included, but little turns on that
as it is not established that Clark was concerned
with the Parker lease.
<P>

10   	On about 19 May, Clark rang Wells and told him that the
owner had instructed him to give three months notice pursuant to the
lease, as
the owner wished to do some demolition at the power room in the premises.  He
said he would come around and give formal
notification and Mr Wells told him to
come, which he did, and then gave a notice dated 19 May 1999 requiring the
premises to be vacated
by 19 August 1999.  He said that Mr Wells did not object
to this but just said OK.  As a result of some correspondence between the
parties or their lawyers disputing the effectiveness of the notice a further
notice was given on 12 July 1999 requiring possession
to be given by 13 October
1999.  As I have said it is not necessary to determine the effectiveness of the
first notice, although
I express the view that it was effective if the three
months clause was a condition of the lease.  In ordinary terms, a period of
three months commencing on 20 May would expire on 19 August.
<P>

11   	Mr Clark said that at the time of serving the notice to
quit and explaining the reason for it and the notice under clause
38, the
demolition clause, Mr Wright said that there was no such clause, Wells said
nothing further and he, Clark, gave them a copy
of the lease.  The parties are
at issue about all the significant conversations, but they are agreed that the
meeting which took
place upon service of the notice was conducted in at least a
polite way, that it was suggested that Clark would assist in trying
to locate
suitable alternative premises, and that Clark gave them a reference as to their
being good tenants.  This is dated 20 May.
 Wells said that what he said (to
Wright) after Clark advised him on the telephone that the lease was to
terminate could be stated
in a court of law, both defendants said that after
the notice to quit was served they telephoned the Law Society to obtain
assistance
in obtaining legal advice and were referred to Mr Wheeler, their
present solicitor.  Mr Wheeler wrote on 30 June 1999 to Fewson,
care of
Camelle, disputing the validity of the notice to quit.  Among other things he
said that there was no entitlement to issue
the notice because the lease was
for twelve months from 5 February 1999 and it had been agreed to give a minimum
of three months
notice after the twelve months term.  He said that was
supported by written evidence, although at least so far as this case is
concerned,
the only evidence is the offer by Mr Wright.  He went on to say that
the extra pages were not part of the original lease, and had
not been seen
previously by his clients nor had they been signed or initialled by them.  That
latter statement may have been made
because the lease itself, at the top of
page four of the yellow pages, states "Special conditions forming part of this
lease are
to signed by both parties and attached."
<P>

12   	The cross-examination of Mr Rorke was rather inconclusive.
He had apparently been asked to make an affidavit and it seems
purchased a form
of statutory declaration and set out some facts on that, but it is not in
evidence.  While his evidence is not very
clear he did state that the lease
agreement was a standard lease agreement from his experience, that he had some
experience with
leases, that as far as he could remember he thought it was
yellow, that there was no mention by anyone when discussing the question
with
him about white pages, and he said in answer to a question:  
<P>

Q:	Do you know what colour it is asserted the annexures were?
<P>

A:	No, all I can remember is just a standard lease.  There was no add on to any
part of the lease that I was a witness to.
<P>

His evidence could not determine the matter, but it certainly supports the case
of the defendants.  
<P>

13   	In consideration of the evidence of the major witnesses,
Mr Clark appeared to be a reasonable witness.  Nevertheless he admitted
the
clauses were not obtained by him from the plaintiff as he had deposed, but were
sent by the plaintiff to someone in the office
of Camelle.  He was not able to
say who had typed out the clauses.  Cross-examination as to statements in an
earlier affidavit got
nowhere.  He said in evidence that the additional three
pages were stapled to the yellow sheet, that he had detached these once only
for the purpose of copying them and had then restapled them to the yellow
sheets.  Counsel for the defendants, in cross-examination
and in submissions,
made something of this, because if that is the position, the restapling
appears, to the naked eye to have gone
through precisely the same holes which
is probably not something which is likely to happen.  A document examiner might
have been
able to give some helpful evidence about this, but none was called.
I do not think the evidence as to the sending of the leases to
Mr Liu assists
the matter one way or the other.  So far as the defendants were concerned, I
thought that Mr Wright was an impressive
witness.  He explained his lack of
apparent anger at the termination of the lease by saying that he was by nature
not an aggressive
man and I accept that.  Mr Wells was not so impressive, but
the case could not be decided by some view that Clark was a more acceptable
witness than the defendants or vice versa.  Wells insisted that the agreement
was for a twelve month lease and thereafter no termination
without three months
notice.  In other words, he insisted that what was agreed was a fifteen month
minimum period.  Wright supported
this.  On that basis it is difficult to
accept the statement of Wells that on reading the lease, he saw that it was
just what had
been agreed, there being nothing in it on his version at all
about three months termination.
<P>

<b>Competing Claims</b>
<P>

14   	The facts which would support the plaintiff's claim are
(a) that a plan was needed to understand whether or not the premises
referred
to in the lease were correct; (b) that Mr Wells had said that the lease was
just what was wanted and Wright read it and
accepted that; and (c) that both
parties expected a demolition clause to be in the lease, if the termination
clause could be called
a demolition clause.  In addition to that the evidence
is that there was a reasonably friendly conversation when the notice to quit
was delivered and the fact that Mr Clark gave a reference to the tenants.  As
against this the matters which support the tenants
are that the evidence of Mr
Rorke did assist their case, although I did not consider him very reliable and
would not give the evidence
much weight; that the employee whom it is claimed
typed the lease conditions did not give evidence; and neither did Mr Booth from
who Mr Clark claimed that he got the wording of the special conditions.  In
addition there is the evidence of the defendants that
upon receipt of the
notice of termination they sought the advice of a solicitor through reference
from the Law Society, and that
the solicitor, albeit about ten days later,
wrote alleging that the three white pages were not in the lease when it was
signed.
<P>

15   	It is difficult to be certain, but in the end I have
concluded that the plaintiff has established its case as it is required
to do,
and that there is more reason to accept its version than the version of the
defendants.  The main reason for this is that,
having regard to the statements
of both defendants that they considered that they were entitled to a minimum of
twelve months and
thereafter three months notice to vacate (which may have been
their intention in their offer letter) there is no basis upon which
it could be
thought the lease was as agreed unless it included the disputed clause.  Clause
35 to some extent supports that finding.
<P>

16   	So far as the notices are concerned, as I have said, I
consider the first was valid, but if it were not there is no doubt
about the
validity of the second notice.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff is entitled to the declaration sought as to
entitlement to possession.  I will hear any argument as to when
possession
should be given.  The defendants must pay the costs of the plaintiff.
