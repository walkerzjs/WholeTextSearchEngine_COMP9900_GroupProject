<b>12016/99 - MATTHEW JOHN WALLACE  v  THE PRESIDENT,</b>
<P>

<b>                     ANTI-DISCRIMINATION BOARD OF NSW AND ORS</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>:
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  1.     By summons the plaintiff Matthew John Wallace ("Wallace")
sought a declaration that the first defendant, the
President of the
Anti-discrimination Board of NSW ("the President") erred in law in concluding
that the President had not received
a written request from Wallace within the
meaning of s91(1) of the <i>Anti-discrimination Act 1997</i> ("the Act"), or
alternatively, a declaration that a letter dated 14 January 1999 from Wallace
to the President constituted notice
in writing, requiring the President to
refer Wallace's complaints to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal ("the
Tribunal") within
the meaning of the Act, and further sought an order that the
President refer Wallace's complaint to the Tribunal.
<P>

2.	These proceedings arise out of a complaint against the second defendant,
Bailey and Gough Real Estate Pty Ltd, and the NSW Police
Service and another
organisation, alleging discrimination against Wallace in the proposed letting
of premises in the Coffs Harbour
area. After some correspondence and
communication of replies to the complaint by the varying parties, the President
determined that
the complaint was lacking in substance in terms of s 90(1) of
the Act.
<P>

 3.	 In a letter dated 16 December 1998 forwarded to Wallace at his home
address the President set out his reasons for his determination,
and advised
Wallace that if he, Wallace, wished his complaint forwarded to the Tribunal:
<P>

"You must write to me and tell me to do this within 21 days of the date of this
letter. If you do not write to me by this date you
will lose your right to take
this matter to the Tribunal and your file will be closed."    
<P>

  
<P>

The letter then set out other information including the address of the
Tribunal.
<P>

4.	Mr Wallace's unchallenged evidence is that about 5pm on 24 December 1998 he
opened the letter dated 16 December 1998 from the
President.   Wallace said in
his affidavit "I do not have a copy of the letters" that he received, there
being two letters in an
envelope.  In evidence before me is a letter which
purports to be a copy of that sent by the President to Wallace, which bears a
date stamp marked "received Coffs Harbour 24 December 1998, Legal Aid".  In
answer to a question from me, counsel for the President
agreed that there was
no issue that the letter was received by Wallace on the same day as the letter
received by Legal Aid, and there
is no issue that Legal Aid received the letter
on 24 December 1988.
<P>

5.	Wallace, by fax dated and transmitted on 14 January 1999, required the
complaints to be referred to the Tribunal.  This was the
twenty-first day from
16 December 1998. The President determined that he had no power to refer the
complaint for hearing since in
his contention the 21 days ran from the date of
the letter from the President, namely 16 December 1998, and therefore the time
for
requiring a referral for hearing expired on 6 January 1999.
<P>

6.	The issue for determination by this Court is the construction of s90 and s91
of Pt 9 Div 2 of the Act dealing with the functions
of the President.
<P>

Section 90 provides:
<P>

	     "<b>President may decline to entertain complaint</b>
<P>

(1)	Where, at any stage of the President's investigation of a complaint, the
President is         satisfied that the complaint is
frivolous, vexatious,
misconceived or lacking in substance,       or that for any other reason the
complaint should  not be entertained,
the President may by
notification in writing addressed to the complainant, decline to entertain the
complaint.
<P>

(2)	The President shall, in a notification under subsection (1), advise the
complainant of:
<P>

(a)	the reason for declining to entertain the complaint, and    
<P>

          	      (b)     where section 91(1) applies to the notification - the
rights of the complainant                			under
that subsection."
<P>

Section 91 provides:
<P>

"<b>Reference of complaint to Tribunal at requirement of complainant</b>
<P>

(1)  Where the President has given a complainant a notification under section
89B(4) or 90(1), the complainant may, within 21 days
after the date of that
notification, by notice in writing served on the President, require the
President to refer the complaint to
the Tribunal.
<P>

(1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a notification in which the President
has given, as a reason for declining to entertain a
complaint, that what has
been alleged in the complaint does not disclose any contravention of this
Act.
<P>

(2)  On receipt of a notice under subsection (1), the President shall refer the
complaint to the Tribunal together with a report
relating to any inquiries made
by the President into the complaint."
<P>

     
<P>

7.	Miss Ronalds, for the President, contends that there is no provision in the
Act for extending the 21 days referred to in s91(1),
and in that respect relies
on <i>Jeffrey Button Sales Pty Ltd v Robson &amp; Anor</i> (Hunt J unreported
12 November 1985) in which his Honour held, in a decision on s118 of the Act
relating to an appeal, that there
was no provision in the Act for an extension
of the period of 21 days and that the Supreme Court does not have the power to
extend
that time.  In effect there is a clear legislative intention that the 21
days is a fixed time and not capable of extension.
<P>

8.	In <i>David v Nunn</i> (unreported 17 October 1995) Dunford J applied that
decision, holding that the 21 days referred to in s118 is mandatory.  A
determination
of the Equal Opportunity Board, referred to the court by Miss
Ronalds for completeness, not as authority, in a case relating to s91(1)
of the
Act, applied the two above unreported decisions as applying to s91, in the same
way as s118 of the Act. 
<P>

9.	I was also referred to <i>Attorney General of NSW v Civic Transport Services
Pty Ltd</i>, a decision on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s101(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>, which reaffirms
the view, particularly as enunciated in that case by Sheller JA, that there
being no extension of time sought within
the 35 days allowed for an application
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s101</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> to state a case, that period is mandatory.
<P>

10.	I can find no possibility of any interpretation of the Act other than as
held above, and agree with the matters put by Miss
Ronalds that the 21 day
period for appeal is mandatory and cannot be varied. This application, however,
is not an application for
an extension of time but seeks a declaration which
requires the interpretation of the meanings of the sections I have set out
above.
<P>

11.	Section 90 of the Act, in examining the complaint, provides that if the
President is satisfied that a complaint is frivolous
and vexatious,
misconceived or lacking in substance, or that for any other reason the
complaint should not be entertained, the President
has a discretion "by
notification in writing addressed to the complainant" to decline to entertain
the complaint.  Section 90 then
prescribes the requirement to set out reasons
for declining the complaint and the rights of the complainant.
<P>

12.	Section 91 gives the complainant a right, within 21 days "after the date of
that notification, by notice in writing served on
the President," to "require
the President to refer the complaint to the Tribunal". Section 91(1) clearly
requires service on or before
the twenty first day from the date of
notification.
<P>

13.	Mr Batley, Solicitor for Wallace, has referred me to the second revision of
the Maquarie Dictionary and the definition of "notification"
which, omitting
technical derivations of the word, provides a primary meaning of "the act of
notify, making known or giving notice",
and a secondary meaning of "a formal
notifying or informing".  The third meaning is "a notice". The various meanings
of "notice"
in that dictionary connote, as does the definition of
"notification", the receipt of knowledge or the bringing to attention of the
recipient. 
<P>

14.	Mr Batley also refers the court to the New Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary Volume 2 published in 1993 which provides as a
primary meaning "the
action or an act of notifying something; intonation, a notice".  The examples,
however, cited in the latter
dictionary, appear to advert to the publication of
notification rather than the fact of receipt of notification.
<P>

15.	It is put by Mr Batley that the Court should give a purposive
interpretation in what is an act protecting the interests of human
rights, and
relies on <i>Kingston v Keprose</i> <i>Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 404</a>, in
particular at page 423:
<P>

	"<b>The purposive approach</b>
<P>

A purposive and not a literal approach is the method of statutory construction
which now prevails: cf <i>Fothergill v Monarch Airlines Ltd </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20AC%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) AC 251</a>
at 272-273, 275, 280, 291.  In most cases the grammatical meaning of a
provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation.
 A search for the
grammatical meaning still constitutes the starting point.  But if the
grammatical meaning of a provision does not
give effect to the purpose of the
legislation, the grammatical meaning cannot prevail.  It must give way to the
construction which
will promote the purpose or object of the Act.  The <i>Acts
Interpretation Act </i>1902 (Cth), s 15AA, and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act
1987</a></i> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a>, both require this approach to statutory construction.
The companies legislation has its own direction to this effect.  The
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/casampa1980708/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
</i>1980</a>, s 5A, enacts:
<P>

`In the interpretation of a provision of a relevant Act, a construction that
would promote the purpose or object underlying the
relevant Act (whether that
purpose or object is expressly stated in the relevant Act or not) shall be
preferred to a construction
that would not promote that purpose or object.'"
<P>

I also refer in that decision to a passage also on page 423: 
<P>

"purposive construction often requires a sophisticated analysis to determine
the legislative purpose and a discriminating judgment
as to where the boundary
of construction ends and legislation begins.  But it is the technique best
calculated to give effect to
the legislative intention and to deal with the
detailed and diverse factual patterns which the legislator cannot always
foresee but
must have intended to deal with if the purpose of the legislation
was to be achieved."  
<P>

     
<P>

16.	I am then referred to the decision in <i>Brofo v the State</i> <i>of
Western Australia and Ors</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=171%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">171 CLR 1</a>, and in particular the majority
decision at page 20: 
<P>

"Indeed, the contemporary approach to statutory construction, with its added
emphasis on legislative purpose (see e.g. Kingston
v Keprose Pty Ltd 118  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987)
11 NSWLR 404</a> at pages 421, 422) and permitted reference to a range of extrinsic
material for the ascertainment of that purpose  ...  has added
an element of
anachronism to a judicial confinement of the permissible basis for discerning a
legislative intent that the Crown be
bound to what is `manifest from the very
terms of the statute'."
<P>

     
<P>

17.	I have also been referred to a decision of the Victoria Federal Court of
<i>Wang v Minister for Immigration and</i> <i>Multicultural Affairs</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 70</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=71%20FCR%20386" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">71 FCR
386.</a>  At page 394, citing <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</i>: 
<P>

"a construction will not be allowed which would enable persons charged with a
statutory power or function to act in such a way as
to truncate or otherwise
modify what the legislature intended."
<P>

 	
<P>

Then:
<P>

"the real point being made is that where a judge concludes that the legislature
could not have intended that a statute could operate
in a manner which defeats
its manifest object or purpose, then an alternative interpretation must be
preferred.  There is a substantial
body of authority that supports that
approach."
<P>

18.	In further aid of interpretation Mr Batley relies on the Hansard debate,
page 343 of Hansard on the second reading speech of
the Premier who introduced
the Bill, where he said that the intention is that the appellant be advised of
the reasons for declining,
and Mr Batley submits that the intention is that the
advice be received.
<P>

19.	In looking at the word "notification" in s 90 one can examine the fact that
the legislature has chosen not to say "by letter"
but says "by notification in
writing", and in  s91 the words used are "given a complainant a notification".
As I have indicated,
I can see no basis for extending the 21 day period, or
there being any power to extend that period. However, the 21 day period is
from
the date of "that notification".  That is referring to the word "notification"
in s91(1) of the Act, which is part of a sentence
which has the words "has
given", the object of that being "a notification". 
<P>

20.	It seems to me that the clear intention of the Act was to prescribe a
specified period for request, but that it must commence
from the actual receipt
of notification. The word "notification" imports the receipt of notice, the
matter being brought to the attention
of the person being notified. The word
"notification" is in the context of the Act intended that the very strict
period commence
from actual notification. In the present proceeding there is no
issue and, therefore, in my view in the terms of the Act the notification
occurred on 24 December 1998 by the receipt of the letter of 16 December 1998
which was addressed to the complainant. 
<P>

21.	Notification, therefore, can occur by personal service, by hand delivery to
the complainant's address, or by the actual receipt
of a letter on a particular
day.  Particularly over the Christmas period where mails may be a little slower
and where there can be
an extended period of public holidays, and at Easter
where delays can create a similar problem, this may well deprive a person of
the opportunity to have 21 days within which to consider and lodge by that
twenty-first day a challenge to the President's determination,
and thereby
request referral of the complaint to the Tribunal. 
<P>

22.	It is in my view not appropriate for someone, by moving home or failing to
go to a letter box for a protracted period, to say
"well I have not received
notification because I didn't open the letter" or "I didn't go to my letter
box" or "mail was not forwarded
to me".  The statute countenances written
notice "addressed to the complainant", meaning "sent to the complainant at a
notified address",
and receipt must be the receipt in effect at the letter box
of the complainant in the normal course.  The <i>Interpretation Act 1997</i>,
which does not here apply because that Act is relevant where an Act prescribes
documents being served by post, provided for service
on the fourth working day
after the letter was posted, which does less than service to a fairly modern
effective postage service
in which service on the next day is more the norm
than the exception.
<P>

23.	It is not open to the President to date a letter which may not be posted
for a couple of days, for administrative reasons, to
deprive a plaintiff of a
rigid fixed 21 day period or part of a fixed 21 day period, and in this respect
I make no complaint against
the President or the Board, since I only refer to
the fact that in any bureaucracy there may be some few days delay.  I am
conscious
that it becomes very easy for a person to allege that a letter was
not received on a particular day in order to gain advantage of
an extended
period, and it is fairly easy even, one has to sadly note, for people to allege
on oath that they did not receive the
document, when in fact they have received
it.
<P>

24.	It seems to me desirable that in order to give effect to the spirit of the
legislation there should be a deeming provision placed
in the Act deeming
service to be, for example, the second business day after postage of a
notification.  However, to give purpose
to an Act which deals with complaints
very often made by unqualified persons, which has a rigid period which cannot
be extended,
it clearly cannot be the legislative effect that the vagaries of
public holidays or some administrative loss of a few days might
deprive a
person of some part of a limited period in which to exercise a referral of a
rejected complaint. 
<P>

25.	I consider, therefore, that the effect of s90 and s91 is that the use of
the words "notification in writing addressed to the
complainant" connotes a
letter being received in the normal course of post or after delivery to that
recorded address, and that the
placing of that letter in the letter box by
either means commences the 21 day period, and that a person cannot elect not to
open
mail, as I have been disturbed to find some people do, or to not take mail
from a letter box, or to not arrange the mail to be collected
during their
holiday period. 
<P>

26.	Notice by mail is a more difficult matter to deal with and could be more
precisely dealt with by the deeming provision which
I have suggested, but in
the absence of such a provision it seems to me that the 21 day period should
not be from the date of the
letter, which clearly if posted, even if received
the next day, provides only 20 days, but that it should be from receipt in the
normal course of post, which is a matter which is provable by evidence but
constitutes an issue of fact. The intention of the Act
is to give a substantive
period, not one which can be arbitrarily shortened. 
<P>

27.	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

	(1)	that the first defendant erred in law in concluding that the first
defendant had not 		received a written request from the
plaintiff within the
meaning of s91(1) of the 			Anti-discrimination Act 1997.
<P>

	(2)  	that the first defendant refer the plaintiff's complaints to the
Administrative 			Decisions Tribunal within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/aa1991204/s91.html" class="autolink_findacts">s91(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/aa1991204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-discrimination Act 1991</a>.
<P>

	(3)  	I order that the first defendant pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

    
<P>

28.	It is clearly desirable that the President have the opportunity to contest
the decision. I grant a stay of that determination
for 21 days.
<P>
