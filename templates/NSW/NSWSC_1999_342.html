MASTER MALPASS
<P>

16 April 1999
<P>

<u>11264/98   -   National Australia Bank Limited v Grewal &amp; Anor</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 21 May 1998.
There are two defendants.  The plaintiff seeks judgment
for possession of the
property known as 4/793-805 South Dowling Street, Redfern (the property).  The
plaintiff's claim is as now
formulated in the Amended Statement of Claim (a
copy of which is annexed to the Amended Notice of Motion filed in Court on 8
April
1999).
<P>

2	The first defendant gave a Mortgage over the property to the plaintiff.  It
was dated 21 May 1996.  Initially, it was given to
secure a guarantee.  Later,
it came to secure, inter alia, the repayment of moneys advanced under a Fixed
Rate Loan Agreement and
an Overdraft Facility.  The Fixed Rate Loan Agreement
came into being following the execution of documentation in August 1996.  The
Overdraft Facility came into being following the execution of documentation in
December 1996.
<P>

3	The plaintiff alleges default under each of these two lending arrangements.
Firstly, it is said that there has been failure to
repay by the agreed expiry
date.  Secondly, it is said that there was the further or alternative default
pleaded in the Amended Statement
of Claim.  Clause 12 of the Fixed Rate Loan
Agreement documentation contained the following event of default:-
<P>

"(a)	if at any relevant time, the debiting of an interest payment, or any other
amount payable hereunder, to the Working Account
by the Bank, would cause the
balance of the Working Account to be placed in debit, or exceed any authorised
credit limit applicable
to the account; or".
<P>

It is alleged that such default took place following the debiting of the
payments of interest for February and March 1998.
<P>

4	The plaintiff now seeks summary judgment as against the first defendant.  The
Court has been informed that relief against the
second defendant has already
been obtained.
<P>

5	The plaintiff has relied on seven affidavits.  The first defendant relies on
two affidavits.  One was sworn by the first defendant
himself.  The other was
sworn by Patricia Bouzanis (the solicitor for the first defendant).
<P>

6	The principles upon which summary relief is granted were not in dispute.  The
Court has a discretionary power to give summary
judgment.  There is abundant
authority for the proposition that summary relief should only be given in what
might be described as
clear cases (see, inter alia, <u>Webster &amp; Anor v
Lampard</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598).</a>  The applicant bears the onus of demonstrating
an entitlement to relief. 
<P>

7	On behalf of the first defendant, two allegedly triable issues have been
identified.  Firstly, there is said to be an issue as
to the agreed expiry
date.  Secondly, there is said to be an issue concerning the alleged further or
alternative default following
the debiting of interest payments.
<P>

8	On behalf of the first defendant, it is accepted that his resistance to the
application must fail if both of the issues are not
regarded as triable.
<P>

9	The first allegedly triable issue is dependent upon material appearing in the
first defendant's affidavit.  He deposes to discussions
had with Mr Di Bernado
(the then business banking manager of the plaintiff at its West Ryde branch).
On his behalf, it is said that
the contractual arrangements comprise both what
was said in discussion and the documentation subsequently executed.  In
particular,
it is contended that this material gave rise to a lending
arrangement for at least three years (the documents show an expiry date
of 31
July 1997 for the Overdraft Facility and of 26 August 1997 for the Fixed Rate
Loan Agreement).  It is not entirely clear when
it is alleged that the relevant
conversations took place.  However, it may be that these were said to take
place prior to or in May
1996.  The first defendant placed reliance on what was
said in <u>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation &amp;
Ors</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">156 CLR 41</a> at 61-62.  It was not contended that the first defendant was
entitled to any relief by way of rectification.
<P>

10	The material contained in the affidavit is inconsistent with the contents of
the subsequent documentation.  The alleged discussion
took place some
considerable time prior to the execution of the Fixed Rate Loan documentation.
It is not said that there was any
prior discussion which related to the
Overdraft Facility.  The plaintiff relies on what was said in <u>Hoyt's
Proprietary Limited v Spencer</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1919] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=27%20CLR%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">27 CLR 133</a> at 139 et seq.  Whilst this
decision has been the subject of some criticism, it remains binding authority
in cases where there is
a distinct collateral agreement.  I mention also that
the documentation contains material suggesting that the writing was to comprise
the contractual arrangements between the parties.
<P>

11	I do not accept the submissions made in relation to the alleged first
triable issue.  In the circumstances of this case, I am
satisfied that there is
no such triable issue.
<P>

12	In support of the alleged second triable issue, the first defendant contends
that the working account was in fact in debit in
a small sum at the time of the
debiting of the relevant interest payment and that on the proper construction
of Clause 12(a), such
an event of default would only be constituted if the
working account was in fact in credit at the time of the debiting of the
relevant
interest payment.
<P>

13	I do not accept either of these submissions.  In my view, these arguments
are neither maintainable on the evidence nor the proper
construction of the
documentation.  I am satisfied that there is no triable issue as alleged.  
<P>

14	For completeness, I should add that the first defendant's own affidavit
contains the admission that "the two loans are presently
in default".
<P>

15	I direct the entry of judgment for possession of the property.  The first
defendant is to pay the costs of the application for
summary judgment.  I
reserve the question of leave to issue a writ of possession.  The exhibits may
be returned.
<P>

	 I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-15 are the reasons for judgment of Master
Malpass.
<P>

	Dated 16 April 1999.		(H D LEWIS)
<P>

	       		 Associate.
