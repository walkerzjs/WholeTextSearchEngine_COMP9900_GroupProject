<b>Friday, 11 June 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>70211/96 - REGINA v James Hepeta TARAWA</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The prisoner, James Hepeta Tarawa, pleaded
guilty to a charge of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act.
<P>

2  	On 7 November 1997, Acting Justice Howie ordered him to perform
200 hours' community service comprising of 150 hours of community
service work
and 50 hours of attendance at the Pendle Hill Attendance Centre.  His Honour
appointed a local court to be the supervising
court.
<P>

3  	The prisoner completed only 39 hours of the work component of the
order, the last on 21 February 1998.  He attended the Pendle
Hill Attendance
Centre for only 23 hours, the last occasion being on 4 May 1998.
<P>

4  	On 17 November 1998 the prisoner was called up for breach of his
Honour's order.  He was arrested and taken before the magistrate
at the
supervising court.  His breach of his Honour's order constituted an offence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/csoa1979292/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/csoa1979292/" class="autolink_findacts">Community Service Orders Act 1979</a>, and the supervising court
convicted him of that offence, and under the provisions under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/csoa1979292/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25(1)(c)</a> of the
Act committed the prisoner to be dealt with by this Court.  The magistrate
allowed him bail.
<P>

5  	On 23 November 1998 the prisoner appeared before me
unrepresented, and I adjourned the matter so that he could obtain legal
advice
and representation.  I ordered his bail to continue.  On the adjourned day, 7
December 1998, he did not appear and I stood
the matter over to 10 December.
He did not appear on that day and I revoked his bail and directed the issue of
a warrant for his
arrest.
<P>

6  	The prisoner was arrested on 2 May 1999 and brought before the
Court on 14 May 1999.  On 14 May 1999 I adjourned the matter
until today and at
the request of his counsel, Mr Hoenig, requested the provision of a
pre-sentence report dealing with the suitability
of the prisoner to serve a
community service order.
<P>

7  	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/csoa1979292/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25(4)</a> of the Act, the powers of this Court are that
<P>

(a)	without prejudice to the continuation in force of the order, impose on the
person a fine not exceeding 2.5 penalty units;
<P>

(b)	deal with the person, for the offence in respect of which the order was
made, in any manner in which the person could have been
dealt with for that
offence by that court if it had not made the order and, unless the order has
ceased to be in force, revoke the
order; or
<P>

(c)	take no action.
<P>

8  	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/csoa1979292/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a>, if this Court imposes a sentence for the offence in
respect of which the community service order was made, it must take into
account
the fact that the order was made and anything done under the order.
<P>

9  	The prisoner's breach of the order was so serious that I consider
it inappropriate for the Court to take no action.  His attention
to his
obligations under the order was sporadic.  Ten letters had to be sent to him
over the period from November 1997 to May 1998,
accompanied by a number of oral
warnings by staff of the attendance centre.
<P>

10  	The prisoner said to the author of the pre-sentence report  that
he failed to complete his obligations under the order because
of his separation
from his de facto wife and a subsequent period of instability in his living
circumstances.  However, he was unable
to explain to the author why he lost
contact with the Probation and Parole Service and why he failed to discuss
these matters with
his community service officer or his community service
attendance co-ordinator.
<P>

11  	Evidence has been given this morning by the prisoner and by his
de facto wife, Miss Saliba, which shows that during the three
month period
beginning some weeks before Christmas 1998 and ending in February or March this
year, the prisoner was absent from his
home, and I accept that the effect of
the stresses of life upon him at that time were such that he could not give
adequate attention
to the ordinary obligations of life, let alone the special
obligations imposed by the order of his Honour.
<P>

12  	The charge of affray for which the prisoner was sentenced by his
Honour arose out of a serious brawl which occurred between
him and friends of
his, and a larger group of young Aboriginal men outside the service station in
suburban Sydney. The brawl led
on to a second more serious incident between the
same groups.  In that incident one man died and another was very badly hurt,
but
as his Honour made clear, the prisoner was not to be sentenced for anything
that happened in the second incident.  The affray with
which his Honour was
concerned occurred when the prisoner and his friends went to a garage to buy
cigarettes.  The prisoner waited
in the car and two of his friends went inside.
Aboriginal young men were there and an altercation took place and an assault.
The
prisoner was not a party to that incident.  All he saw was the continuation
of the altercation and the assault when the parties to
it came outside the
service station to the place where the prisoner was.  When he realised that
there was trouble between the two
groups, the prisoner got out of the car and
joined his friends.
<P>

13  	His Honour found that the prisoner was the first person to use
actual physical violence outside the service station.  Shortly
after he had
struck one of the Aboriginals, a brawl arose which gave rise to the charge of
affray.  The prisoner and about four of
his colleagues were outnumbered by
members of the opposing group. During the brawl, the fighting became heavier
because weapons like
sticks and a garbage can came to be used.  During the
brawl the prisoner went into the service station and asked for something to
arm
himself with.  He was denied such assistance, so he left the service station,
found himself a piece of wood, and returned to
the fray.  He and his colleagues
were overwhelmed and he suffered minor injuries.  That was the end of the
affray, so far as concerned
the criminal responsibility of the prisoner.
<P>

14  	His Honour observed that as a general rule, a person coming
before the Court convicted of conduct of this kind, might expect
to receive a
full time gaol sentence.  However, his Honour took into account a number of
features favouring the prisoner.  Although
he was the first to use actual
violence, he was not responsible for the situation which gave rise to it.
Others in his group started
things going.  Secondly, the prisoner was not
responsible for the use of weapons in the fight.  Although he armed himself, he
did
so only because others had already done so.  Thirdly, he and members of his
group had not visited the garage with the intent to engage
anyone in a fight.
Next, the prisoner had no history of violence.  His Honour accepted that this
was an isolated incident of violence
on his part, and he became involved
because his friends were involved.
<P>

15  	Then there was the plea of guilty.  Although it was offered at a
late stage, after the empanelment of the jury, his Honour
was satisfied that
the prisoner had indicated a long time before that he would plead guilty to
affray.  Up until commencement of
the trial, the Crown had been proceeding
against the prisoner for much more serious charges arising out of the death and
the injury
which occurred in the second incident.
<P>

16  	Next, his Honour took into account the youth of the prisoner,
who was 21 years old at the time of the offence and 23 at the
time of the
sentence.
<P>

17  	His Honour also took into account the prisoner was in a stable
partnership with his partner, and that he accepted responsibility
as a father.
His Honour considered that the prisoner had a settled life.  Subsequent events
show that his Honour was seriously misled
about that.
<P>

18  	Then his Honour took into account some co-operation between the
prisoner and the police.
<P>

19  	In the pre-sentence report dated 17 June 1999 the prisoner's
Probation and Parole officer considers that the prisoner does
not require
supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and that because of his
previous unsatisfactory performance he is unsuitable
to perform a further
community service order.  He is considered suitable for periodic detention.
<P>

20  	The report of Anita Duffy, a consultant psychologist, has been
put before the Court.  Following tests, Miss Duffy concluded
that the
prisoner's psychological profile conformed with most types described by the
designers of tests as -
<P>

... tending under stress to go into a panic reaction which may lead to
aggressive behaviour towards others or to themselves.  They
suffer from an
immature personality and there is a lack of foresight. In a small sample
surveyed, 90% had no further convictions
after four years.
<P>

21  	That summary seems remarkably accurate, considering the activity
of the prisoner and the offence for which he was sentenced,
and in his
subsequent inappropriate reactions to stress, leading to his cessation of
participation in his obligations under the community
service order.
<P>

22  	The report of Miss Duffy continues:
<P>

His main mode of dealing with stress has been to internalise it, until he
reaches  a peak where he "explodes", often doing or saying
things that he
regrets later.  This has led to arguments between himself and his girlfriend,
and separations during this period which
have further destabilised him.  He has
tended to react in a rather immature fashion, metaphorically throwing his hands
in the air
and ceasing his commitments. In this way his behaviours are short
sighted and have repercussions which damage him in the long term.
<P>

23  	Although the prisoner has been assessed as suitable to serve a
period of periodic detention, I think that the author of the
pre-sentence
report might have come to a different view if he had seen the report to which I
have just referred. The problem now
is that the prisoner hopes to go back into
a home situation with his girlfriend, with whom he has reconciled, and their
two children.
Stresses will come upon him again and when they do, they will
affect his attitude to all his obligations, including any obligation
he is put
under by any order of this Court. I do not think, for that reason, and in view
of the history of the matter, that he is
a suitable subject for periodic
detention.  I think the appropriate order to make is a short term of full time
detention.  I note
that the prisoner has been in custody since he was arrested
on 2 May 1999.
<P>

24  	Mr Tarawa, on the charge of affray I revoke the community
service order.  I sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed term of
two months,
commencing on 2 May 1999 and expiring on 1 July 1999.  In imposing sentence, I
take into account that the community service
order was made and the work that
you did under it and the attendances which you made under it.  In relation to
the separate offence
constituted by your breach of the order, I take no
action.
<P>
