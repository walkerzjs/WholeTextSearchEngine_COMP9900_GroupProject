<b><u>70006/99  -  REGINA  v  Denis Allen BRITTAIN</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 21 January 1999, an application was made
by Denis Allen Brittain under s 474D of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.  The application
sought an order under s 474E(1)(b), that the whole of Mr Brittain's case be
dealt with as an appeal, pursuant to
the Court of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a>.
<P>

<b>Mr Brittain's Conviction</b>
<P>

2  	On 4 May 1990, Mr Brittain was charged with the following offence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/" class="autolink_findacts">Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985</a>:
<P>

"For that he between 1 July 1989 and 5 February 1990 at Pilliga State Forest in
the State of New South Wales did knowingly take
part in the cultivation of a
number of prohibited plants, namely cannabis plants, which number was more than
the commercial quantity
applicable to the prohibited plant"
<P>

3  	Mr Brittain stood trial with a co-accused, Mr Christopher
Hasenkamp, before his Honour Judge Hosking and a jury in the District
Court at
Narrabari.  The trial began on 10 May 1993.  Mr Brittain was found guilty (as
was Mr Hasenkamp).  On 2 June 1993, Hosking
DCJ sentenced Mr Brittain to a
minimum term of four years and eight months (expiring on 25 June 1998), and an
additional term of
one year and nine months (expiring on 25 October 1999).
<P>

4  	An appeal was lodged against conviction.  It was heard by the
Court of Criminal Appeal on 15 August 1994 (Meagher JA, Studdert,
Blanch JJ),
and was dismissed.
<P>

<b>The Basis of the Application</b>
<P>

5  	On 5 February 1990 the police discovered three plantations,
containing cannabis, in the Pilliga State Forest.  There were some
five
thousand plants.  The only issue at the trial was whether Mr Brittain, and his
co-accused, were involved in their cultivation.
<P>

6  	There was no direct evidence implicating Mr Brittain.  The case
against him depended upon circumstantial evidence, and lies
said to have been
told by him to two detectives, Cohen and Clout.
<P>

7  	I need not repeat the detail of the circumstantial case relied
upon by the Crown.  It is set out in the judgment of Studdert
J in the Court of
Criminal Appeal (<b><i>R v Brittain </i></b>(CCA, unreported, 15 August 1994)).
It is enough to say that the circumstances included the recovery of certain
property at Mr Brittain's
home in Victoria, upon the execution of a search
warrant.  The items found included documents which unmistakably connected Mr
Brittain
with the Coonabarabran area.  The documents included the following:
<P>

(i)	A driver's licence in his name with the address "12 Hilton Estate, PO Box
114, Coonabarabran".
<P>

(ii)	An empty envelope, being date 28 July 1989, addressed to "Mr D Brittain"
at the same address.
<P>

(iii)	A Telecom account addressed to Mr D A Brittain at the same post office
box number at Coonabarabran bearing date 20 November
1989.
<P>

(iv)	A Commonwealth Bankcard statement addressed to Mr Denis  Brittain
identifying a transaction at Coonabarabran bearing date 14
May 1989.
<P>

8  	The warrant was executed by, amongst others, Detectives Cohen and
Clout.  It is not immediately clear whether any complaint
is made in respect of
the property seized.  That property included certain photographs.  The
photographs depicted Mr Brittain at
a campsite.  The campsite included a tent.
The tent was distinctive, and said to resemble a tent which was found at the
plantation
in the Pilliga State Forest.  Elaborate evidence was given by a
police officer comparing the campsite depicted in the photographs
with the
campsite adjacent to the plantation.
<P>

9  	The application by Mr Brittain under s 474D records the following
matters, in the context of these photographs:
<P>

"Both Detectives gave evidence that when asked about the photographs and told
of the plantation, Mr Brittain said `I went camping
near Mudgee.  I have never
been to Coonabarabran.'"
<P>

10  	The application also includes the following summary of evidence
given by the detectives at the trial:
<P>

"Detectives Cohen and Arahill gave evidence that later on 4 May 1990 Mr
Brittain had participated in an unsigned typed record of
interview.  They both
maintained that Mr Brittain had said the photographs had been taken on a
Victorian camping trip."
<P>

11  	Mr Brittain did not give evidence at the trial.  He did make an
unsworn statement.  He denied having told police that he had
never been to
Coonabarabran.  He stated that the photograph had been taken on a pig hunting
expedition in the Pilliga State Forest.
 Mr Brittain denied having participated
in a record of interview with Detectives Cohen and Arahill.  He denied any
involvement in
the cannabis plantation.
<P>

<b>The Police Royal Commission</b>
<P>

12  	Both Detectives Clout and Cohen came under adverse notice during
the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service.
 The application
under s 474D identifies fifteen matters involving one or other, or both,
detectives, in which it is said that they
acted corruptly.  Such matters do not
include the investigation involving Mr Brittain.  However, they do include the
following:
<P>

(a)	The confiscation of monies by Det Clout and others which were then not
recorded as having been found (on 28.11.89).
<P>

(b)	The receipt of monies by Det Clout and others in order to support an
application for bail.
<P>

(c)	The payment of money to Det Cohen and others in order to avoid being
charged.
<P>

(d)	The confiscation of money found at premises, and then not recorded, shared
between Dets Cohen, Clout and others (19.02.90).
<P>

(e)	The confiscation of money and drugs in the course of a search, which were
then shared between Dets Cohen, Clout and others.
<P>

(f)	On 13.07.91, a person was arrested at premises where several thousand
dollars were found and some heroin.  The detectives, including
Det Clout,
confiscated and shared the money.  They recorded the seizure of only part of
the heroin.  The balance was "put back to
work".
<P>

(g)	Det Clout and another police officer accepted a substantial sum for not
verballing someone, and "going easy" in the record of
interview (30.05.92).
<P>

(h)	Det Clout prepared a "letter of comfort" for a prisoner about to be
sentenced before Viney DCJ in return for money.
<P>

(i)	Det Clout was said to have planted heroin in the overalls of a suspect in
the course of a search (21.09.92).
<P>

(j)	Dets Cohen and Clout on 20.02.92 searched premises at South Penrith,
discovering five cannabis plants, $10,000 cash, and two
pounds of cannabis.
The person was charged simply with the five cannabis plants.  The cash and
cannabis were shared between those
involved in the search, including Dets Clout
and Cohen.
<P>

13  	There are a number of other matters besides.
<P>

<b>Attitude of the Crown</b>
<P>

14  	The matter was referred to the Crown Solicitor's Office, in
accordance with the usual procedure, to prepare submissions on
the application.
There was some delay in the preparation of those submissions.  On 1 June 1999,
a letter was received from the Crown
Solicitor in these terms:
<P>

"<b>Denis Allen Brittain:  Applicaton for Review of Conviction pursuant to s
474 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.</i></b>
<P>

My officer has considered the application lodged on behalf of the abovenamed
dated 21 January 1999 and the material referred to
therein.  Having received
the advice of junior counsel and the Crown Advocate, the Crown does not wish to
file written submissions
in opposition to the course suggested by the applicant
(that is, to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal).
<P>

It is accepted that the fresh material sought to be relied upon by the
applicant is of a character that could satisfy the relevant
test propounded by
s 474E(2), particularly insofar as it relates to the words `a doubt or question
as to ... any part of the evidence
in the case'."
<P>

<b>Determination and Order</b>
<P>

15  	Having considered the application, it appears to me that there
is a doubt or question as to part of the evidence in the case
against Mr
Brittain, namely the evidence given by Dets Clout and Cohan.
<P>

16  	In accordance with s 474E(1)(b), I therefore refer the whole of
the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as
an appeal under
the Court of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/caa1912137/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Appeal Act 1912</a>.
