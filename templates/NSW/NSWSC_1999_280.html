<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY, 26 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>3335/97 - ANNE LIM V TIMOTHY JOHN OVERALL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   These proceedings come before me following  my decision
in 4144/98.  It is now clear that the matter has been settled for $16,000
by
way of acceptance of an offer of compromise.  Accordingly, there must be an
order in these proceedings that the defendant pay
to the plaintiff the sum of
$16,000.  The next question is the question of costs.
<P>

2	An offer of compromise was made on 11 September 1998 and accepted on 28
September 1998.  Part 52A r 22(1) of the Supreme Court
Rules says:
<P>

"Upon the acceptance of an offer of compromise in accordance with Pt 22 r 3(5),
the defendant shall, unless the Court otherwise
orders, pay the costs in
respect of a claim by the plaintiff against the defendant up to and including
the day the offer was accepted."
<P>

3	Mr D Flaherty, for the plaintiff, says that that rule directly applies here.
Mr G Roberts, for the defendant, says that it does
not and he compares and
contrasts the rule with other subrules which make a distinction between the
case where the offer is made
by the defendant and where the offer is made by
the plaintiff.  I appreciate that argument, but it does seem to me that subrule
1
deliberately takes up both sets of offers, so that the rule is applicable.
<P>

4	The next question is whether the court should "otherwise order".  As to this
Mr Roberts says that there is an inconsistency between
subrule 1 and subrule 6
in that the latter focuses on the date of the making of the offer, and the
former the date of acceptance.
 Of course, logically there is no acceptance in
the case covered by subrule 6, but nonetheless there could well be a situation
whereby
considerable costs are built up between the time the offer of
compromise is made and the time when it is accepted.
<P>

5	Mr Roberts puts that it is inappropriate that these costs should be borne by
the defendant.  He says the defendant made an offer
on the 11th, the plaintiff
did nothing until the very last moment, ran up costs and then accepted it, and
that that operates unfairly
to the defendant.
<P>

6	Mr Flaherty puts, on the other hand, that this is a common aspect in
litigation and that it is really for the defendant's solicitors
to make sure
that offers of compromise are made sufficiently early so that the twenty-eight
days, which is the minimum time for which
they can be open under Pt 22 r 3(5),
expires before the hearing.  If defendants do not make offers of compromise
early enough, then
the consequences about which Mr Roberts complains, and which
can be even worse in other cases, are  just part of the ordinary thrust
of
litigation.
<P>

7	After consideration, I think that is right, and that, unless any particular
circumstances are shown, the court should not otherwise
order that the date of
acceptance be the relevant date.
<P>

8	The other matter is the question as to whether I should apply by analogy Pt
52A r 34.  That rule does not directly apply because
the court has not yet made
an order for the amount of $16,000, which is well under the present $40,000
amount prescribed under r
34.  However, the court will be making an order very
shortly to terminate these proceedings in accordance with the settlement.
<P>

9	Mr Roberts says either because the order will be made or, alternatively, by
analogy with r 34, as the plaintiff gets an order
for an amount under $40,000
then she should not be entitled to any costs.
<P>

10	Mr Flaherty, on the other hand, says r 34 does not apply to an offer of
compromise situation; people can compromise proceedings
for a number of
reasons, and that the amounts for which a matter is settled is not necessarily
something that bears any relation
to what the court might give, had the court
heard the matter to finality.
<P>

11	Again, I think the plaintiff's contention is correct. Accordingly, the costs
consequences should flow from Pt 52A r 22, that
is, that it should be recorded
that the plaintiff is entitled to costs of the 
<P>

proceedings up to and including 28 September 1998.  The costs since 2 October
are taken up in the other proceedings.
