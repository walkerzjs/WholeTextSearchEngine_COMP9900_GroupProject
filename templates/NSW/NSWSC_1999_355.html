11076/97	<b>DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
v   BARRY COURT</b>
<P>

11077/97	<b>DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
v   MICHAEL JOHN TAIAROA</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : The Director General of the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture has brought these proceedings against the defendants
Barry Court
and Michael John Taiaroa under the <i>Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction)
Act</i>, 1967, alleging that each defendant has been guilty of offences under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act, </i>1923</a>.  The prosecutions against each defendant
were heard together and Mr Fitzgibbon appeared for both defendants.
<P>

2	The prosecution concerned events that occurred on 7 August 1995 when two tick
infested horses were brought into New South Wales
from Queensland.
<P>

3	Before reviewing the facts it is appropriate to define the offences charged,
which are identical against each defendant.
<P>

4	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i> provides, by sub-s (1):
<P>

	<i>"A person must not introduce stock into the State in contravention of a
provision of a proclamation under this Act."</i>
<P>

5	The prosecutor relies on three provisions of a proclamation which it contends
each defendant has contravened:
<P>

(i)	Proclamation No. 520 made pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i>
provides in Provision 2:
<P>

	<i>"A person must not introduce into New South Wales stock that is infested
with cattle tick."</i>
<P>

Both defendants are alleged to have contravened that provision.
<P>

(ii)	Provision 3 of the same proclamation provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	A person must not introduce stock into New South Wales unless notice
of introduction of the stock has been given in accordance
with this
clause.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	A person who intends to introduce stock into New South Wales must give
notice of his or her intention to do so to the border
inspector at a crossing
place at least forty-eight hours before the introduction of the stock."</i>
<P>

The prosecutor contends that neither defendant gave notice as required by the
above provision.
<P>

(iii)	Provision 5(3) of Proclamation 520 provides:
<P>

	<i>"(3)	A person must not introduce stock into New South Wales without a
permit for the introduction of the stock issued by a border
inspector."</i>
<P>

Once again the prosecutor contends that each defendant offended against the
above provision.
<P>

	<b>The prosecution evidence reviewed</b>
<P>

6	The evidence introduced in the case for the prosecution comprised the
following affidavits:
<P>

(i)	the affidavit of Daryl Llewellyn sworn 27 February 1997;
<P>

(ii)	the affidavit of Graham Kellaway sworn 27 February 1997;
<P>

(iii)	the affidavit of Francis Broughton, again sworn 27 February 1997;
<P>

(iv)	the affidavit of Neil Smith sworn 27 February 1997;
<P>

(v)	the affidavit of Richard Jane sworn 15 March 1999.
<P>

7	Affidavits in reply came from Graham Kellaway, sworn 14 July 1998 and from
Stephen Pont, sworn 3 September 1998.
<P>

8	Mr Kellaway and Mr Pont were required for cross examination, but the factual
issue on these prosecutions was a limited one.  Neither
defendant denied
involvement in bringing the two horses concerned into New South Wales and
neither defendant denied the breach of
any one of the provisions of the
proclamations relied upon.  The only issue of fact on the prosecutions was
whether the defendants
or either of them was aware he was committing any one of
the offences.
<P>

9	In these circumstances the facts relied upon by the prosecution can be fairly
shortly reviewed.
<P>

10	Daryl Llewellyn was at the relevant time a stock inspector employed by the
prosecutor in the course of his duties and on 7 August
1995 he observed on a
monitor provided in conjunction with camera surveillance of traffic a white
Nissan Cabstar ute towing a horse
float.  He saw the vehicle enter New South
Wales from Queensland via the Tweed Heads bypass.  Having done so he pursued
the vehicle
and eventually brought it to a halt.  Mr Llewellyn inspected the
two horses he observed in the horse float which he described as
<i>"paddock
horses in rough condition"</i>.  The defendant Michael Taiaroa identified
himself as the driver of the Nissan and he told Mr Llewellyn that the horses
were being
transported from Kin Kin in Queensland to Taree.  He explained that
he did not own the horses but that he was transporting them for
his friend Mr
Court, who was following him.  The defendant said he was not aware of the
requirements for horses entering New South
Wales from Queensland.  Mr Llewellyn
requested the defendant to turn the vehicle around and to present the horses
for examination
at the Kirra treatment yards.  Mr Taiaroa complied with that
request.
<P>

11	This defendant was interviewed at Kirra and freely answered questions that
were asked of him.  He acknowledged that he had crossed
the border at Tweed
Heads, and that he did not present the horses to the Border Crossing Inspector.
He admitted that he had no crossing
papers, he had given no notice to the
border inspector and he had no permit.  He was asked whether he had seen signs
on the roadway
directing stock to the Kirra yards but he said he had seen no
such signs.
<P>

12	Mr Kellaway was the assistant section manager and he attended at Kirra after
both the defendants had arrived there.  By that
time ticks had been taken from
the horses; they appeared to be cattle ticks.  Mr Kellaway spoke to Mr Court
and he asked both Mr
Court and Mr Taiaroa whether there was any paperwork
accompanying the horses.  He was told there was not.  The defendant Mr Court
asked whether it would help on a prosecution if he pleaded ignorance and was
told it would not.
<P>

13	Francis Broughton is an inspector with the prosecutor and he participated in
the examination of the horses at the Kirra Treatment
Yards.  He said that six
ticks were removed from a brown gelding, being one of the horses, and several
ticks were removed from the
second horse, a black gelding.
<P>

14	It was Neil Smith, another inspector with the prosecutor, who removed the
ticks from the horses, inviting Mr Court to look at
them as he did so.  Mr
Smith spoke to Mr Court and Mr Court said that the horses were his.  Mr Smith
informed Mr Court that the horses
had been introduced into New South Wales
without proper procedure and when the defendant asked what he should have done
he was told
that he should have applied for a travel permit and notified the
inspector at the border crossing.  Again Mr Court appears to have
answered what
he was asked in a forthright fashion.  
<P>

15	The evidence satisfies me that both animals were heavily infested with
cattle ticks.  I accept the description Mr Kellaway gave
in his affidavit of 27
February 1997 as to the ticks observed on examination.  On the brown gelding,
there were approximately forty
larval stage cattle ticks on the animal's neck,
forty-five such ticks on the point of the shoulder, ten on the lower jaw and
thirty-five
on the chest and upper front leg area.  On the black gelding there
were twenty larval stage cattle ticks on the crest of the neck,
fifteen on the
point of the shoulder, five on the lower jaw and ten on the chest and upper
foreleg.
<P>

16	The evidence establishes each of the offences charged against each of the
defendants.  The prosecution has proved that these
two animals were brought
into New South Wales when infested with cattle tick.  The breach of Provision 2
of Proclamation 520 has
accordingly been proved.  The evidence further
establishes that neither defendant gave notice of intention to bring the
animals into
New South Wales as required by Provision 3 of the Stock Diseases
Proclamation 520.  The evidence further establishes that neither
defendant had
a permit for the introduction of the stock as required by Provision 5(3).
<P>

17	Whilst the defendant Mr Taiaroa owned the horse float by means of which the
horses were being introduced into this State and
whilst he drove the vehicle
towing that float, the defendant Mr Court owned the horses and Mr Taiaroa was
bringing the horses to
New South Wales for Mr Court and with his knowledge.
<P>

18	I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved its case against both
defendants and, indeed, Mr Fitzgibbon did not contend to
the contrary.
<P>

	
<P>

<b>The cases for the defendants</b>
<P>

19	The following affidavits were introduced in the cases for the defendants:
<P>

(i)	the affidavit of Barry Court sworn 10 March 1998;
<P>

(ii)	the affidavit of Michael John Taiaroa sworn 9 March 1998;
<P>

(iii)	the affidavit of Susan Marie Court sworn 3 March 1998.
<P>

20	In addition Mrs Anne Taiaroa, the wife of Michael Taiaroa, gave evidence.
<P>

21	Mr Court acknowledged in his affidavit the ownership of the two horses.  He
had acquired them without cost; they were former
trotting animals, and they
were acquired as horses for the Court children to ride.
<P>

22	Mr Court, his wife and his children moved from an address near Taree to Kin
Kin in December 1994.  Mr Court was a tiling contractor
by occupation but he
and his wife had undergone a course of training as remedial therapists and in
December 1994 they went to Queensland
to work in that capacity on a health
farm.  In August 1995, their work in Queensland having come to an end, Mr and
Mrs Court were
on their way back to Taree.  Mr Taiaroa was a friend of Mr
Court, the two having met in Queensland several months before the date
of the
commission of the offences.
<P>

23	Mr Court said he was not aware that there were any regulations governing the
introduction of the horses into New South Wales.
 He was not aware in short
that he was committing any offence in arranging for Mr Taiaroa to transport the
horses but he acknowledged
of course his awareness that Mr Taiaroa was taking
them on his behalf, and indeed Mr and Mrs Court were in a following vehicle.
<P>

24	On the hearing there was concentration in the evidence upon a number of road
signs.  Their location was identified in an affidavit
sworn by Mr Kellaway on
14 July 1998.  There are photographs attached to that affidavit and I am
satisfied on the evidence that those
photographs show signs that were in place
on 7 August 1995.
<P>

25	Prior to the journey being stopped the defendants were of course travelling
in a southerly direction.  Their journey took them
past the airport at
Coolangatta.  At that point there were four lanes for southbound traffic and
some 200 metres south of the airport
there were positioned beside the roadway
two signs, one of which was beside the nearside edge for southbound traffic and
the other
of which was erected on the grass median strip.  Those signs carried
the legend:
<P>

	<i>"Livestock vehicles via Kirra stock yards.  Left lane."</i>
<P>

26	Further on for southbound traffic, at a point some 400 metres south of the
airport, there is a division in the roadway.  What
was previously a four lane
highway for southbound traffic became a two lane highway at the Tweed Heads
bypass which comprised the
right hand fork in the road at that point for
southbound traffic.  The other fork was Coolangatta Road.  Prominently
displayed at
that fork was a sign reading:
<P>

	<i>"Livestock vehicles must exit."</i>
<P>

27	Immediately below those words on the sign was a directional arrow indicating
livestock vehicles were to go into Coolangatta Road.
 The defendants did not do
so.  Proceeding along the Tweed Heads bypass in the direction in which the
defendants proceeded at approximately
1.1  kilometres south of the airport, was
another sign which reads:
<P>

	<i>"Stock and hay vehicles prohibited on Tweed bypass.  Camera
surveillance."</i>
<P>

28	Another 200 metres south there was another sign which reads:
<P>

	<i>"Stock for treatment must go via Kirra Treatment Yards."</i>
<P>

29	Then another 600 metres to the south there is a further sign:
<P>

	<i>"Stock and hay vehicles must exit left."</i>
<P>

30	Mr Court said he did not notice any of these signs but he said that had he
done so it would not have registered with him that
the signs were relevant to
the transport of his two horses.  He said he had travelled this route three or
four times before, but
he was unaware of the signs.
<P>

31	Mr Taiaroa, like Mr Court, expressed his ignorance of any regulatory
requirements governing the movement of these horses.  Mr
Taiaroa is a fruit
farmer by occupation.  He said that he had acquired the horse float in May
1995, because his wife had acquired
some horses, but he had no direct
involvement with stock.  Like Mr Court, Mr Taiaroa said that he did not notice
these signs on the
journey in question nor on any previous journey.
<P>

32	Mrs Court was travelling with her husband on 7 August 1995.  Her evidence
was that she did not observe the signs either and Mrs
Court said that she knew
of no requirements restricting the movement of the horses back into New South
Wales.  Mrs Court made no
inquiries of any public authority about that matter,
although when the Courts were about to move to Queensland at the end of 1994
she did inquire of the Roads and Traffic Authority as to whether there were any
restrictions for the moving of the horses to Queensland
and was informed that
there were not.
<P>

33	Mrs Taiaroa was accompanying her husband on 7 August 1995 but, like her
husband and her friends, Mrs Taiaroa did not observe
the road signs that I have
described.
<P>

34	Each of the defendants was cross examined extensively.  Mrs Court and Mrs
Taiaroa were also cross examined.  I did not form an
unfavourable impression of
any one of these four witnesses.  I do not find that either defendant acted in
deliberate defiance of
the requirements of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i> or the
proclamations thereunder.  It is perhaps surprising that neither of the
defendants nor their wives had learned that there
were controls that governed
the movement of stock into New South Wales.  It is perhaps also surprising that
none of these travellers
on the journey in question or on any previous journey
observed any one of the signs which I am satisfied were quite prominently
displayed.
 However I have regard to the sworn evidence each of these witnesses
gave and I do not find that the evidence I have reviewed was
untruthful.
<P>

35	Video film was tendered to show the signs I described earlier.  The film was
taken using a camera located in a moving vehicle.
 There was also the video
film taken on the day these offences were committed, and the camera captured
the movement of the Nissan
towing the horse float.
<P>

36	Mr Taiaroa went to the trouble of taking further film showing the scene from
a vehicle closely following two removalist vans.
 This video film was presented
with a view to showing how, in close traffic behind large vehicles, a
motorist's view of the notices
I have described might be obstructed.  Be that
as it may, what the camera captured as to the movement of the Nissan towing the
horse
float on the journey in question does not indicate heavy traffic
conditions, and certainly not conditions which would have prevented
a traveller
who was keeping a proper lookout for notices from seeing what was on them.
<P>

37	The only explanation for the defendants travelling on in ignorance of the
signs is that each of them was keeping no lookout for
the presence of these
road signs.  Neither defendant could have been paying any regard for the
presence of signs in the relevant
area.
<P>

38	An affidavit was sworn by Mr Pont.  Mr Pont was working as a traffic
controller with the local council in August 1995 when he
saw Mr Taiaroa's truck
towing the horse float travelling south.  He said that he identified this
vehicle as being a vehicle he had
seen in April 1994 when he was employed by
the prosecutor and was on duty at the Boyd's Bay crossing station.  On that
occasion in
1994 Mr Pont had spoken to one of the occupants of the vehicle who
had told him he was going to Kin Kin and Mr Pont had a conversation
with this
person which would indicate an awareness of relevant permit requirements.
<P>

39	Mr Pont gave evidence before me, and I accept without hesitation that he
gave evidence honestly and to the best of his recollection.
 However I am
satisfied by the evidence which Mr and Mrs Court gave that they did not go to
Queensland in April 1994 and I am further
satisfied that they did not have the
use of Mr Taiaroa's Nissan or his horse float when they did go to Queensland.
I accept that
the Courts did not meet the Taiaroas until a few months before
the journey in August 1995 and I therefore conclude that Mr Pont must
be
honestly mistaken in his recollection.  I have no reason to doubt that Mr Pont
had an encounter such as he described in his affidavit
in April 1994 but I do
not find that that encounter involved either defendant.
<P>

	<b>The gravity of the offences</b>
<P>

40	The prosecutor tendered an affidavit from Mr Richard Jane, veterinary
surgeon.  He is the Chief Veterinary Officer for the prosecutor
in New South
Wales and he manages the cattle tick programme in this State.  An annual budget
of $7.2 million is provided for the
programme committed to the eradication of
cattle tick from New South Wales and the protection of the cattle industry from
incursions
of cattle tick and tick fever.  The greatest area of threat,
according to Mr Jane's affidavit, is the Queensland cattle tick affected
area,
which Mr Jane's affidavit does not define.  Mr Jane's evidence is that cattle
tick have the ability to reproduce rapidly with
each female tick laying up to
3500 eggs.  It was Mr Jane's opinion, and I accept it, that the introduction of
these two horses did
represent a very serious threat to the cattle industry.
Fortunately the intrusion was detected before any harm could be done.
<P>

41	Mr Jane's evidence was not challenged and I am satisfied that these offences
must be regarded as serious.
<P>

42	The scheme of penalties for an offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases
Act</a> </i>is set out in that section.  The maximum penalties have been increased
for offences committed since 1 September 1997 (see <i>Statute Law
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</i>, 1997).  However those most relevant
increases do not apply to these prosecutions, relating as they do to events
that occurred on
7 August 1995.  For present purposes, where stock was
introduced into the State in contravention of a provision of a proclamation
under the Act and at the time of such introduction the stock were actually
diseased, the maximum penalty was 200 penalty units, that
is $20,000.
Fortunately, as I have already observed, the introduction of these horses did
not lead to other stock in New South Wales
becoming actually diseased.  Had it
done so, the maximum penalty provided in respect of each offence would have
been 1000 penalty
units ($100,000), or imprisonment for six months, or both.
Whilst the maximum penalties that would have applied had the introduction
of
these horses caused disease to other stock have no possible application in
respect of the subject offences, I have referred to
them for completion.
<P>

43	Each of these offences committed by each of these defendants is in a
category of offence for which the maximum penalty prescribed
at the relevant
time was $20,000.
<P>

44	What are the subjective features to be considered in the case of each
defendant?
<P>

45	Mr Court has no relevant criminal history and I treat him as being a person
of good character.  It is to be brought into account
in his favour that he
freely admitted his involvement in the commission of the offences and I am
prepared to accept not only that
he did not see the relevant road signs but
that there was no conscious and deliberate offence committed by him.
Nevertheless I accept
Mr Saidi's submission that there was gross carelessness
on his part.  If he did not know of the danger that ticks presented he ought
to
have known and if he did not know of the requirements governing the movement of
stock into New South Wales he ought to have made
it his business to inquire as
to whether there were any such requirements.  Moreover, he should have known
these two horses were
carrying ticks.
<P>

46	Mr Fitzgibbon invited me to consider giving the defendants the benefit of s
556A of the <i>Crimes Act</i>.  I cannot accede to that submission.  I consider
these offences to be too serious to permit of such an approach.
<P>

47	Mr Taiaroa I accept as being a person of good character with no convictions.
Like Mr Court he co-operated freely with the departmental
officers encountered
on 7 August 1995.  I accept in his case, as in the case of Mr Court, that there
was no deliberate disobedience
of the provisions of the statute and the
proclamations, in the sense that he did not know of the requirements which
governed the
introduction of these two horses.  However, again in the case of
Mr Taiaroa, I accept the submission of Mr Saidi that I should regard
Mr Taiaroa
as having been grossly negligent in his participation in the movement of these
horses.  Whilst I accept that he did not
know what was required he ought to
have made it his business to find out before participating in the transport.
Mr Taiaroa should,
like Mr Court, have known these two horses were carrying
ticks.  There is no suggestion that he had no opportunity to inspect the
horses
before he assumed the responsibility of their transportation into this
State.
<P>

48	Should Mr Taiaroa be treated more leniently than Mr Court?  He was not the
owner of the animals and he did what he did as a favour
to his friend.  However
I have concluded that the nature of his participation and involvement is such
that the same penalties ought
to be imposed upon each defendant.
<P>

49	What should the penalties be?
<P>

50	I was informed by counsel that these are the first cases for offences of
this nature in which resort has been had to the <i>Supreme Court (Summary
Jurisdiction) Act</i>.  Previously prosecutions have been pursued in the Local
Courts.
<P>

51	I have been provided with a schedule detailing convictions and penalties
imposed in the Local Courts under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i>, going back as
far as 1988.  Many of these convictions were for offences against <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i>, involving the unlawful introduction of livestock
into this State.  The penalties imposed in the Local Courts varied.  The
largest
penalty recorded on the schedule was for an offence in 1995 when 125
infected sheep were moved contrary to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20C(2)(c).</a>  It is to be observed that
that was not an offence involving the introduction of infected livestock into
New South Wales, but the
movement of infected stock already within this State.
The maximum penalty available in that case was $10,000, as opposed to $20,000
in the present case in respect of each offence.  The penalty in that 1995 case
was $4000.  The schedule otherwise does not disclose
penalties in excess of
$1000 for any one offence.
<P>

52	It is significant that the legislature saw fit to increase the penalties for
offences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20</a> in 1989.  Prior to these increases, the maximum monetary
penalty for any offence under the Act was $2000.  The amending Act, No.
181 of
1989, recast <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> of the statute and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20</a> was amended to its present form.
The increase in penalties was very significant indeed.  I set out in para 42
above the increased
penalty for the introduction of diseased stock; absent
disease, the introduction of stock into New South Wales contrary to a provision
of a proclamation attracted an increased maximum penalty after the 1989
amendments of $10,000.  The Second Reading Speech of the
Minister for
Agriculture and Rural Affairs makes it clear that the penalties before their
increase were regarded by Parliament as
totally inadequate.  One of the cases
which the Minister referred to in that Speech as illustrating the inadequacy of
the regime
of penalties concerned the transportation of calves and hay from a
tick affected area in Queensland into New South Wales.  That introduction
was
causative of very serious tick infestation and the need for an extremely costly
programme of eradication.  Penalties imposed
in the Local Court were
nevertheless reduced on appeal to the District Court in that matter, where the
aggregate penalties for the
various offences charged in consequence of the
introduction totalled only $1100.  Plainly the offences in that case were much
worse
than these with which I am presently concerned, but, of course, those
penalties preceded the 1989 amendments.  Since the offences
concerning the
calves had led to the spread of disease, the offender in that case would, after
the amendments, have been facing a
maximum penalty of $100,000 per offence.
<P>

53	It is relevant to heed the 1989 amendments as evidencing the "public
expression" by Parliament as to the seriousness with which
it views breaches of
the various categories of offences contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20:</a>  see <b><i>R v
H</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%203%20A%20Crim%20R%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 3 A Crim R 53</a> per Moffitt P at 65, and <b><i>Camilleri's Stock
Feeds Pty Limited v EPA</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20683" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 683</a> per Kirby P at 698.
<P>

54	Mr Saidi provided a second schedule detailing penalties imposed for
environmental offences.  The cases in this schedule record
penalties imposed in
the Land and Environment Court for offences against a variety of statutes,
including the <i>Clean Waters Act, </i>the <i>Clean Air Act, </i>the<i> State
Pollution Control Commission Act, </i>and the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/eoapa343/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Offences and
Penalties Act</a></i>.  I have considered that schedule but I have concluded that
it affords very limited guidance in the approach I should take to my
present
task.
<P>

55	Indeed whilst I have considered closely the content of the schedules
produced by Mr Saidi, and in particular the schedule relating
to the penalties
imposed under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i>, I do not find ultimately that I am
greatly assisted by the scheduled penalties, absent more information as to the
various cases
in which the penalties were imposed.  It is also a relevant
consideration when looking at penalties imposed in the Local Court that
for
offences prior to 1 September 1997 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/s20l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 20L(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i>
set a maximum penalty of $10,000 in that court for any offence against the Act
unless the Act specifically imposed a lesser penalty,
in which case that lesser
penalty was to be the maximum penalty:
<P>

	<i>"20L.  (2)  If proceedings are brought in a Local Court, the maximum
pecuniary penalty that the Local Court may impose for the offence
is 100
penalty units or the maximum penalty provided for the offence by this Act or
the regulations, whichever is the lesser."</i>
<P>

56	I must be guided by general sentencing principles.
<P>

57	In determining the penalty to be imposed, it is necessary to assess the
seriousness of the offences against the background of
the possible gravity of
offences for which the maximum penalty has been set.  Here in each case the
maximum penalty is $20,000, but
that penalty is only appropriate for an offence
properly to be regarded as exemplifying the worst kind of breach to which the
penalty
relates.  I respectfully adopt in analysing my task what Kirby P said
in <b><i>Camilleri's Stock Feeds</i></b> at 698:
<P>

	<i>"The task of a court is to assess the relative seriousness of the
offender's particular offence in relation to a worst case for which
the maximum
penalty is provided.  Having determined the relative seriousness of the
offence, the penalty to be imposed is that which
approximately correlates upon
the scale of penalty set by the legislature from zero to the maximum.</i>
<P>

<i>	A maximum penalty is to be imposed where the case falls within the worst
category of cases for which the penalty is prescribed. 
This is to be
determined on the facts of the case:  Ibbs v The Queen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20163%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 163 CLR 447</a> at
452.  However, `that does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it
be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity
can always conjure up a case of
greater heinousness.  A sentence which imposes the maximum penalty offends this
principle only if
the case is recognisably outside the worst category':  Veen v
The Queen [No 2] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 465</a> at 478."</i>
<P>

58	I do not view these cases as belonging to the worst category of cases for
which the penalty of $20,000 has been prescribed. 
Plainly they do not fit such
a category or anywhere near it.  Neither defendant is to be treated as having
deliberately flouted the
provisions of the relevant proclamation, although I
have found that each acted with gross carelessness.  Neither defendant was
introducing
these horses for gain or as part of a business; the defendant
Taiaroa was doing his friend a favour and the defendant Court was,
as it were,
moving house, and in the process was moving his children's horses.
<P>

59	It is fortunate that the introduction of these horses was quickly detected
before any spread of ticks to other animals; of course,
as I observed earlier,
had there been the spread of disease, the offences would have moved into the
gravest category attracting the
much greater maximum penalty of $100,000.
<P>

60	It is proper that I take into account that each of these defendants
co-operated fully with departmental officers following apprehension.
 I take
into account that each defendant freely confessed his involvement in the
transportation, and that the only issue raised by
either defendant in this
Court was the absence of knowledge of the presence of signs and the statutory
requirements which prompted
their erection.  True it is that each defendant
would have faced a powerful case had he conducted his defence differently, but
nevertheless
I should heed the approach in fact taken by each defendant in
arriving at an appropriate penalty.
<P>

61	Each defendant is going to face a substantial burden for the payment of the
costs of the prosecution in this Court, and this
is a factor not to be
ignored.
<P>

62	It would be quite wrong to view each of the three offences charged against
each of the defendants in isolation.  I must heed
the principle of totality,
and this, of course, calls for a broad evaluation overall of all the
contraventions of the proclamation
under the statute.  Those breaches, of
course, all concerned the movement of the same horses on the same day.  The
defendants introduced
horses that were infested with cattle tick, and they did
so without giving the required notice and without obtaining the required
permit.  
<P>

63	I do not consider either of these defendants is likely to contravene the
requirements of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda1923157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stock Diseases Act</a></i> again.  However each defendant
must be punished and the consideration of general deterrence must be
recognised.
<P>

64	Whilst I shall proceed to impose fines for each offence, I intend to impose
penalties which in aggregate I consider to be appropriate
to the particular
circumstances of these two cases.
<P>

65	In determining appropriate penalties I should have regard to the financial
circumstances of each defendant.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/" class="autolink_findacts">Fines Act</i> 1996</a>
provides:
<P>

	<i>"In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine,
the court is required to consider:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably
and practicably available to the court for consideration,
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the
fixing of that amount."</i>
<P>

66	The authorities establish that it would be unjust to impose penalties which
a defendant has no reasonable capacity to pay.
<P>

67	In <b><i>Kaye v Vagg (No 2)</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2011%20A%20Crim%20R%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 11 A Crim R 127</a> Cox J, having
referred to a number of decisions, stated their effect at 129:
<P>

	<i>"They establish, as Cosgrove J says in Devlyn v Lowe (unreported, Supreme
Court of Tasmania, 23 May 1980), that `the imposition of
a fine which is beyond
the offender's reasonable capacity to pay never was just or rational.'"</i>
<P>

68	In <b><i>R v Fraser</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2020%20A%20Crim%20R%204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 20 A Crim R 4</a> Davies, Kelly and Beaumont
JJ in their joint judgment made an extensive review of the authorities on the
relevance of an inability
to pay and said at p 12:
<P>

	<i>"We think some relevant considerations are correctly and succinctly stated
in Hines at pars 9.24 and 9.25:</i>
<P>

<i>	`An offender should not be fined a sum which he has no means of paying...,
and that principle makes it wrong to impose such a fine
on the footing that
some other person will pay... The [Court of Criminal Appeal] in Lewis  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20Crim%20LR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965]
Crim LR 121</a> made it clear, however, that `the court should not be misled into
thinking that present incapacity to pay is conclusive.  There may
be many cases
where a man at the moment may only be able to reveal overdrafts and debts,
whereas somewhere at his beck and call are
to be found resources with which he
can meet the penalty'; moreover, future earning capacity is obviously relevant
provided that
regard is had to current local work prospects."</i>
<P>

69	<b><i>R v Rahme</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2043%20A%20Crim%20R%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 43 A Crim R 81</a> is further authority for the
proposition that an offender's ability to pay is an important consideration in
arriving at a penalty.
 In that case, having regard to the appellant's
disclosed means and capacity to pay, the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced the
penalty
imposed at first instance by more than seventy-five percent.  Finlay J
reviewed the relevant authorities at pp 86-89.
<P>

70	See also <b><i>Smith v The Queen</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 1</a> and in particular
the judgment of Kirby P at 12.
<P>

71	Whilst no evidence was introduced at the hearing on 17 March 1999 as to the
financial resources of either defendant, the parties
have since agreed that I
should consider affidavits subsequently sworn by the defendants which deal with
their financial positions.
<P>

72	The affidavit of Mr Court, which I have identified as Exhibit 9, was sworn
on 15 April 1999.  The prosecutor does not seek to
challenge the content of
that affidavit which discloses that Mr Court is a person of limited means.  He
is a self-employed tiling
contractor conducting his business in partnership
with his wife.  Both are dependent entirely upon the income of that business
although
both Mr and Mrs Court had earlier conducted business in remedial
massage.  They have three children living at home; one is employed
as the
defendant's apprentice but the other children are not earning.  Indeed, the
youngest child is still at school.
<P>

73	Mr Court's affidavit discloses a total taxable income for the partnership
for the year ended 30 June 1997 of $24,098.  The affidavit
discloses much the
same picture for the year ended 30 June 1998 and the nett income for the year
ended 30 June 1999 is expected to
be some $26,000, to be divided equally
between Mr and Mrs Court.
<P>

74	The affidavit discloses that the combined assets of Mr and Mrs Court are
modest.  They own no real estate, they rent their premises
at Wallsend,  and
they have borrowed on the two vehicles that they possess.  Assets have been
valued at under $17,000 and liabilities
in excess of $22,000.
<P>

75	The estimated nett weekly income for the partnership for the year ending 30
June 1999 is $513.  Details of income and expenditure
on an average weekly
basis as set out in the affidavit disclose a modest excess of expenditure over
income.  However I note the defendant's
expressed intention to attempt to
increase his income and to reduce his expenditure to pay the penalties and
costs in this matter.
 Obviously he will have to do both.
<P>

76	I must have regard to the evidence in Mr Court's affidavit in fixing the
penalties to be imposed in his case.
<P>

77	The defendant Mr Taiaroa swore an affidavit on 17 April 1999 and I have
identified that affidavit as Exhibit 10.  Once again
the prosecutor does not
seek to challenge the content of this affidavit.  Mr Taiaroa carries on farming
in partnership with his wife.
 Unlike Mr Court, Mr Taiaroa does have an
interest in property.  He and his wife own their farm, although it is
apparently encumbered.
 The farm with house has a stated value of $180,000, but
that supports a loan advanced by the defendant's mother-in-law in excess
of
$80,000.  This defendant and his wife have liabilities to a bank and a finance
company of approximately $20,000.  The partnership
assets exceed liabilities by
over $100,000, but the surplus is represented by the farm and farming equipment
which, of course, are
essential to produce income.
<P>

78	For the year ended 30 June 1997 the farming business produced for the
partnership a taxable income of under $13,000.  The year
ended 30 June 1998 was
more successful, the business showing a nett profit of $32,000 before tax.  The
defendant expects the current
financial year to produce a partnership income of
$20,000 after tax.  However the defendant said, and I accept, that farming
income
is extremely volatile and difficult to predict.
<P>

79	The defendant and his wife have four children, three of whom are fully
dependent on their parents.  Paragraph 9 discloses an
excess of weekly
expenditure over income.  This defendant stated an intention in his affidavit
to borrow funds to meet his obligation
for penalties imposed and costs.
Obviously he will then have increased expenditure in repaying those loans.
<P>

80	It would seem that Mr Taiaroa has more assets than Mr Court but like Mr
Court his ability to meet penalties in this case is limited.
<P>

81	I have decided that I should reduce the penalties I would otherwise have
imposed in the case of each defendant so as to take
account of his financial
position.  Whilst I recognise such differences as there are in their respective
financial positions, I have
nevertheless decided, as I indicated earlier, that
I should punish each defendant in the same way so that the orders I will make
in each case in respect of penalties are the same.  I propose to impose a
penalty in each case of $2000 in respect of the offence
identified in paragraph
1 of each summons and a penalty of $750 in respect of the offences identified
in paragraphs 2 and 3 thereof.
<P>

82	This brings me to costs.
<P>

83	Correspondence has been forwarded to my associate by agreement between the
prosecutor and the defendants.  I have had that correspondence
identified as
Exhibit E.  Such correspondence records an agreement that the defendants will
pay the prosecutor's legal costs and
disbursements in the sum of $15,000.  It
has been agreed, as that correspondence discloses, that each defendant is to be
responsible
only for $7500 of the prosecutor's total costs.  In the case of Mr
Court it has been further agreed that he will pay his share of
such costs at a
minimum rate of $100 per month.
<P>

84	The agreement I have outlined will be reflected in the orders for costs that
follow.
<P>

85	No application has been made to me by either defendant for time to pay the
penalties I am about to impose nor would any such
application be appropriate,
having regard to the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/" class="autolink_findacts">Fines Act</a></i>, 1996.  The penalties I
impose are to be payable within twenty-eight days, subject to any application
that may be made to the registrar
of this court pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa199669/" class="autolink_findacts">Fines Act</a></i>.
<P>
