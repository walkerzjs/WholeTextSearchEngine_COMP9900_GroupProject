<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Dismiss statement of claim</b>
<P>

<b>					for want of prosecution)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 1 June 1999 the first
defendant seek that the proceedings be dismissed for want of prosecution
pursuant
to Part 33 r 6(2) of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  The first
defendant relied on the affidavit of Benjamin Peter Cran sworn 27 May 1999 and
the plaintiff relied on the affidavit
of William Francis Mason sworn 11 August
1999.
<P>

2  	I turn to the law.  Part 33 r 6(2) provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	...</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or
direction as to the conduct of the proceedings, or does not prosecute
the
proceedings with due despatch, the Court may, on application by any part or of
its own motion, stay or dismiss the proceedings.</b>
<P>

3  	The power of the courts to dismiss an action for default or want
of prosecution should be exercised only where the plaintiff's
default has been
intentional and contumelious or where there has been inordinate and inexcusable
delay on his or his lawyer's part
giving rise to a substantial risk that a fair
trial would not be possible due to serious prejudice to the defendants:
<b><u>Birkett v James</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202%20All%20ER%20801" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2 All ER 801</a>;  AC 297 at 318.  In each
case, a balance must be struck between the plaintiff and the defendant and the
court must decide whether
or not, in all the circumstances, justice requires
that the proceedings should be dismissed:  <b><u>Witten v Lombard Australia
Ltd</u></b> (1968) 88 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 405 at 411;  <b><u>Southern Cross
Exploration NL v Fire &amp; All Risks Insurance Co Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%204%20NSWLR%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 4 NSWLR
491</a>;  <b><u>McKenna v McKenna</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1984/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] VicRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20VR%20665" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] VR 665.</a>
<P>

4  	In <b><u>Stollznow v Calvert</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 749</a> Moffitt P
held that the discretion to dismiss proceedings for want of prosecution is to
be exercised for each case upon its own facts
by deciding whether, on striking
a balance between the plaintiff and the defendant, justice demands that the
action should be dismissed.
 The judgment makes it clear that the discretion is
not confined and that authority does not and cannot establish the weight to be
given to particular classes of facts or circumstances.  
<P>

5  	Applications of this kind recurringly return attention to
particular kinds of considerations, namely that the conduct of a plaintiff
himself and his contribution to delay is considered separately from conduct,
contribution and defaults of his solicitor, but it is
not the law that a
litigant has no involvement in his solicitor's shortcomings or that they are
not relevant.  It is not the responsibility
of a litigant to ensure that his
opponent is adequately represented or to point out steps which his opponent's
representatives ought
to take to advance the claim against him.  In relation to
delay, the longer it continues the more difficult becomes the determination
of
factual issues because dim memories and unavailable witnesses render the
elucidation of the truth more difficult to ascertain.
 Prejudice both actual
and presumed should be considered.
<P>

6  	On 10 June 1994 the plaintiff filed a statement of claim against
the four defendants namely Allan Meares as first defendant,
Western Suburbs
Hospital as second defendant, Dow Corning Australia Pty Limited as third
defendant and Dow Corning Wright as fourth
defendant for negligence arising out
of the insertion and subsequent removal of a breast implant.  In June 1994 a
settlement proposal
was made as part of the global settlement for people
affected by Dow Corning implants but it had to be approved by the American
courts.
 There were difficulties in the global settlement and the plaintiff has
still not received any moneys from that settlement.  The
proceedings remain on
foot as between the plaintiff and the first defendant.
<P>

7  	However, the plaintiff has also been named as a plaintiff in
proceedings against the third and fourth defendants.  On 4 April
1999 the
plaintiff was given leave to discontinue these proceedings against the third
and fourth defendants.  Now there are no longer
duplicate proceedings involving
the third and fourth defendants.  The plaintiff is now in a position to file
Part 33 particulars
and is being medically examined on 7 September 1999.  
<P>

8  	The plaintiff is desirous of bringing her proceedings to
finality.  Although the cause of action arose in 1991 and the statement
of
claim was filed over five years ago her reason for not prosecuting these
proceedings was as she was waiting on the American courts
to approve settlement
of her claim and pending the outcome of those proceedings she may not have
pursued these proceedings.  I take
into account that if this claim is dismissed
the plaintiff still may obtain compensation for the American proceedings
although this
is not certain.  No medical or experts reports have been served
as yet notwithstanding that five years have elapsed since the proceedings
were
instituted.  Particulars were answered after four year delay.  In 1998 the
plaintiff had further surgery and has had a period
of illness.  The defendant
has not shown that it suffers from actual prejudice although I accept that
there is presumptive prejudice.
 Hospital records have been subpoenaed and are
available although it is appreciated these records do not tell the whole story.
While
the plaintiff has not pursued her claim as diligently as she should have
it is my view that justice require that the plaintiff case
not be dismissed.
It should be permitted to go to trial.  
<P>

9  	In relation to costs, in 1998 the first defendant's solicitor was
advised that the plaintiff may not be pursuing this claim.
 On 2 November 1998,
23 February 1999 and 12 April 1999 the first defendant wrote to the plaintiff
and asked whether the plaintiff
wished to continue with these proceedings.  The
plaintiff was advised that if they need no response, this  motion would be
filed.
 The plaintiff's solicitor did not respond to any of these letters.  It
was only after the motion was filed that the plaintiff started
to prepare the
matter for trial and advised the first defendant's solicitor that the plaintiff
wished to pursue these proceedings.
 Costs are discretionary and in these
circumstances it is my view that the plaintiff should pay the costs of the
motion.
<P>

10  	The first and second defendants consent to the matter being
transferred to the District Court.
<P>

11  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The defendant's notice of motion filed 1 June 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the first defendant's costs .
<P>

(3)	The matter is transferred to the District Court Sydney Registry.
