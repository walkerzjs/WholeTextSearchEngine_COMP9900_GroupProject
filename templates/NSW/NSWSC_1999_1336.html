<b>JUDGEMENT on Smyth's Expert Evidence</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:	Objection has been taken to the reading of
certain segments of the statements made by Mr Richard Smyth.  The first
objection raises a question of principle and is thrown up by paragraphs 4.2 and
14.18 of Mr Smyth's statement of 11 February 1999,
by paragraph 3 of Mr Smyth's
statement of 22 April 1999 and by paragraphs 137 through to 140 of Mr Smyth's
statement of 9 September
1999.
<P>

<i>`Prior to the commencement of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, to be admissible the
opinion of an expert needed to satisfy the following tests:</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	the opinion had to be relevant to a fact in issue;</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	there had to be evidence capable of proving the facts upon which the
opinion was based;</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	the witness had to disclose the facts upon which the evidence was
based;</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	there had to be a relevant field of expertise, which was sufficiently
organised or recognised to be accepted as a reliable body
of knowledge or
experience;</i>
<P>

<i>(5)	the witness had to be an expert in that field;</i>
<P>

<i>(6)	the opinion could not be related to a matter of common knowledge;</i>
<P>

<i>(7)	the opinion could not concern the ultimate issue, that is, the expert
was not permitted to give an opinion on the very issue of
fact or law which the
court had to determine.</i>
<P>

2   	The current rules for the admissibility of expert evidence
are:
<P>

<i>(1)	the evidence must be relevant <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 55)</a> and have sufficient probative value
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.135</a> and in criminal proceedings <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.137)</a>;</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	the witness must have specialised knowledge based on training or
experience <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 79)</a>;</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	the opinion expressed by the witness must be based wholly or
substantially on that knowledge <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 79).</a></i>
<P>

3   	It is to be noted absent the making of a limiting order, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
79</a> will apply in terms.  The section provides that 
<P>

<i>"If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study
or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to an
opinion of that person
that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge".</i>
<P>

4   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 79</a> is a direct rejection of the American Frye<i>
</i>Test [<i>Frye v United States</i> -293 F 1013 (1923)].  The Frye test had
required that an expert's opinion be related to a recognised field of expertise
or result
from the application of theories or techniques accepted in that
field.
<P>

5   	It is important to note that an expert witness should not
be allowed to stray outside the witness' area of expertise.  It is
for this
reason that the opinion expressed by the witness must be based wholly or
substantially on the witness' specialised knowledge,
which is in turn
specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience.
<P>

6   	At common law, the field of expertise prerequisite required
a court in determining the admissibility of expert evidence, to
assess the
reliability of the knowledge and experience on which the opinion was based.  A
question may be suggested as arising as
to whether a similar exercise is
required under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.
<P>

7   	The Australian Law Reform Commission did not enter the
difficult field of determining what were the criteria which were required
to be
shown before the field of expertise would be treated as a recognised or
accepted field of expertise.  The Commission recommended
that there be no field
of expertise test.  The Commission's position was that:
<P>

<i>"there will be available the general discretion to exclude evidence when it
might be more prejudicial than probative, or tend to mislead
or confuse the
tribunal of fact.  This could be used to exclude evidence that has not
sufficiently emerged from the experimental
to the demonstrable."  </i>
<P>

[<i>Australian Law Reform Commission, Evidence, </i>ALRC 26 (Interim) Vol.1
(AGPS, Canberra, 1985) at para 743]
<P>

8   	This position is reflected in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></i>, which requires only that the expert have "specialised knowledge", with
the exclusionary rules regarding irrelevant, prejudicial
or misleading evidence
presumably operating to exclude the opinions of specialists in unreliable and
unacceptable fields of expertise.

<P>

9   	It is appropriate then that a trial Judge examine
evidentiary reliability under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s56.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 56</a> and/or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135</a>, and
when doing so, exercise the court's appropriate discretion to ensure that the
manner in which evidence is adduced by an expert
not have a quite often
unforeseen consequence, which by dint of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> and/or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 77</a> of the Act would
otherwise result, namely that evidence which neither party intended to be
evidence of the fact, becomes evidence
of the fact.  That situation can very
easily arise if the court is not astute to limit the precise purpose for which
assumptions
relied upon by experts in their reports or matters stated in those
reports as facts are admitted into evidence.
<P>

10   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> provides as follows
:
<P>

<i>'The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation
that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other
than proof of the
fact intended to be asserted by the representation'.</i>
<P>

11   	Plainly enough the provision does not reflect the common
law.  Under the common law, where evidence of a previous representation
is
admitted for a non-hearsay purpose, it may only be used for that purpose.
<P>

12   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 77</a> repeats the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60</a> formula <i>'evidence
relevant for a purpose other than</i> . . '.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s77.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 77</a> provides as
follows:
<P>

<i>'The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion that is admitted
because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof
of a fact about the
existence of which the opinion was expressed.'</i>
<P>

13   	An opinion may be relevant, for example:
<P>

<i>*	if the conveying of the opinion was a fact in issue</i>
<P>

<i>*	to a person's state of knowledge</i>
<P>

<i>*	to show the basis of other opinion evidence given by an expert</i>
<P>

14   	If the opinion is admitted as relevant for one of these
purposes it can also be used as evidence of the facts about which
it is
expressed.
<P>

15   	Clause 76 in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/eb199390/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Bill 1993</a> was the equivalent
provision to s.77 of the Act expressed in identical terms.  The Bill contained
the following example of the way
in which the provision was intended to
operate:
<P>

<i>'W, who has been fraudulently holding himself out to be a doctor, diagnoses
D to be HIV negative.  D is charged with knowingly transmitting
the virus to V.
At the trial of D, the court admits W's evidence about the diagnosis to show
that it was made.  Despite the Opinion
Rule, that evidence becomes admissible
to prove that the diagnosis was made.'</i>
<P>

16   	The example was not carried over into the Act.
<P>

17   	Justice Beazley has commented :
<P>

<i>"It is of course one thing to provide that hearsay evidence may be used as
evidence of the facts asserted.  It is another matter to
provide that evidence
of an opinion may become evidence of the facts about which it is expressed. . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>It cannot be expected that evidence of this nature will, as a matter of
course, be left unchallenged.  It may be that the legislature,
in its attempts
to smooth the road to admissibility, has created instead a fertile field of
litigation."</i>
<P>

<P>

18   	`In <i>Trust Company of Australia Limited v Perpetual
Trustees WA Limited</i> (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales,
McLelland CJ in Equity, 18 September 1996), his Honour dealt with an objection
to
a report purporting to be an expert's report.  The objection was based
substantially on the ground that the matters in respect of
which the expert
purported to express opinions in his report, comprised or included matters
going beyond a field of expertise in
which the expert had been shown to be
qualified to give opinion evidence.
<P>

19   	McLelland CJ in Equity dealt with the matter as follows:

<P>

<i>(a)	by first defining the extent to which the expert had been shown to have
specialised knowledge based on his training and experience;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	by then identifying, by description, the matters upon which the expert
was qualified to express opinions;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	by holding, in relation to opinions expressed in the report going beyond
those descriptions, that assuming, without deciding,
that they would be
admissible under section 79, they would not be admitted in the exercise of the
Court's power under section 135,
in particular in reliance on sub-paragraph
(c).</i>
<P>

20   	As it was difficult, if not impossible, having regard to
the form of the report, to physically sever the opinions from those
which
should not be admitted, counsel were invited by the court to agree that certain
sections of the report before his Honour should
be admitted, possibly with an
appropriate qualification by way of a section 136 direction.
<P>

21   	His Honour stated that if no such agreement could be
reached it would be necessary for the report to be either recast or for
the
expert to give oral evidence in lieu thereof within the limitations
indicated.
<P>

22   	It is necessary to refer briefly to the plaintiffs' case
which throws up the relevant issues sought to be addressed by Mr
Smyth's
evidence.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff's case is that prior to 23 November 1983 Mr
Walker represented and warranted to Mr Hogarth that Mr Walker was
in a position
to provide political contacts, resources and expertise to secure the rezoning
of the Ensile land to permit its use
for residential development within twelve
months of an agreement being reached for Mr Walker to provide such political
contacts,
resources and expertise.   [para 20]
<P>

24   	Mr Walker would provide political contacts, resources and
expertise to ensure the securing of the rezoning of the Ensile land.
 [para
22(e)]
<P>

25   	The plaintiffs further assert that during October and
November 1993 and prior to 22 November 1993 Mr Walker on behalf of himself
and
Walker Consolidated and/or Walker Corporation made the following further
representations to Mr Hogarth:
<P>

<i>(a)	that in the opinion of Mr Walker and Walker Consolidated the Lady
Carrington Estate was immediately suitable for rezoning for
residential
purposes;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that Walker Consolidated and/or Walker Corporation was a company
experienced in developing broad acre land into residential subdivisions
and
obtaining all the necessary approvals and in developing residential town land
into residential strata unit development;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	that the securing of the rezoning of the lands would be jeopardised if
Mr Hogarth continued to have any involvement in the process
and that Mr Hogarth
must take a back seat in relation to the rezoning process;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	that if Mr Hogarth entered into a joint venture in relation to the
Ensile land neither Mr Walker nor Walker Corporation nor any
of its
subsidiaries or associated companies would during the term of the joint venture
undertake any land development activities
in and around Helensburgh except on
the basis that such lands would form part of the lands to be subject to the
joint venture.  
 </i>[para 31 J]
<P>

<i>(e	he, Mr Hogarth, would not be involved in the processes necessary for
obtaining the rezoning and subdivision of the land and that
in consideration
thereof;</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	Mr Walker and/or Walker Consolidated and/or Walker Corporation would
procure the rezoning of the land promptly.</i>[para 32(b) and (c) J]
<P>

26   	The contentions then assert that Mr Walker and Walker
Consolidated failed to use their best endeavours to procure promptly
or at all
the rezoning of the Ensile land and in particular the Lady Carrington Estate so
as to enable the residential subdivision
thereof as promised.
<P>

<i>(i)	At a Commission of Inquiry over which Dr Mark Carleton presided which
conducted hearings between 5 July 1994 to 15 November 1994,
Walker Corporation
or Walker Consolidated conducted the representation of Rosamond and relied
almost exclusively on material originally
prepared for Lady Carrington Estates
Pty Limited and provided by Lakatoi to Walker Consolidated under the
HUTA.</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	The Commission of Inquiry Report dated December 1994 recommended no
change in existing City of Wollongong LEP zonings until further
studies were
undertaken as to the effectiveness of the water settling ponds proposed by Lady
Carrington Estates Pty Limited to maintain
water quality.</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	Since that date Walker Corporation and Walker Consolidated have done
nothing to establish further studies to establish the effectiveness
of water
settling ponds to maintain water quality or to procure the rezoning of the
Ensile Land.</i>
<P>

27   	Evidence has been adduced in extensive detail in relation
to the dealings between the parties which led in due course to events
in
mid-February 1994 including the formal announcement by the Minister for
Planning, Mr Webster, that there would be a Commission
of Inquiry into the
appropriate land uses and zonings in the vicinity of Helensburgh.
<P>

28   	By letter of 9 February 1994, the Minister for Planning
and Housing wrote to the General Manager of the Wollongong City Council
in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>`I refer to your letter requesting that I make the Council's draft local
environmental plan, for environmental protection zones at
Helensburgh.</i>
<P>

<i>As you are aware, the numerous planning proposals for Helensburgh in recent
years, involving both development and conservation have
generated considerable
controversy.  When the Director of Planning issued the Certificate under
Section 65 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> on 20 May
1992, to enable the draft plan to be publicly exhibited she noted that there
were a number of development proposals under
consideration.  She then urged
your Council to give full and proper consideration to these proposals.  The
Director also noted that,
after the public exhibition of the draft plan, it
might be appropriate to consider holding a Commission of Inquiry to assist in
resolving
the planning issues.</i>
<P>

<i>After considering a report by the Department of Planning, I am of the view
that full and proper consideration has not been given to
the range of planning
proposals at Helensburgh and that a Commission of Inquiry is warranted to
assist me in my decision on the draft
plan.  I have therefore directed under
section 119(1)(a) of the Act that a Commission of Inquiry be held into
appropriate land-uses
and zonings in the vicinity of Helensburgh.</i>
<P>

<i>In view of the long history of planning proposals in Helensburgh and
extensive controversy that debate has generated I am sure that
you will agree
that an inquiry is the most appropriate way of ensuring that all points of view
are heard and considered in an independent
and impartial way.</i>
<P>

<i>When I receive the report of the Commission of Inquiry I shall refer it to
the Council to consider.</i>
<P>

<i>I have given an undertaking to the Lord Mayor that I shall not use my powers
to rezone the lands in Helensburgh against Council's
decision after it
considers the report of the Commission of Inquiry.</i>
<P>

<i>I look forward to the Council's support and cooperation in the
process.'</i>
<P>

[8/58]
<P>

29   	As a result of the sending of this letter, the issues
tendered for determination extend beyond the question of whether, and
if so
how, the Walker Interests by having, as it is submitted they ought to, approach
the preparation and presentation to the Commission
of Inquiry in altogether a
different manner, the Commissioner's recommendations may have been different.
The further issues tendered
for determination is as to whether and if so how,
regardless of what further or other recommendations the Minister may ultimately
have determined to include in his report, those recommendations may
nevertheless have had no material result by reason of the giving
of the
Minister's undertaking to the Lord Mayor of the Wollongong Council, set out in
his letter of 9 February 1994.  In short, the
case includes questions going to
whether and if so, in what ways the types of success before the Commission
which the plaintiffs
contend could have been achieved would or could have led
to a rezoning in circumstances in which the Minister's undertaking had been
given and in circumstances in which focus would require to be addressed to the
lobbying of Wollongong City Council to open the way
for rezoning, had the
Commission recommended in favour of rezoning.
<P>

30   	I turn then to Mr Smyth's situation. It is first necessary
it seems to me to address the extent to which Mr Smyth has been
shown to have
specialised knowledge based on his training and experience.
<P>

31   	Mr Smyth's CV is appended to this judgment.
<P>

32   	Mr Smyth has been shown in [his] CV to have specialised
knowledge based on his training and experience:
<P>

<i>(a)	In relation to the Commission of Inquiry process, including;</i>
<P>

<i>&#183;	the manner in which recommendations may be made to the Minister to
establish Commissions of Inquiry;</i>
<P>

<i>&#183;	the presentation of evidence and to the Commission of Inquiry;</i>
<P>

<i>&#183;	the provision of resources, including political contacts and the
media, to advance their cases before Commissions of Inquiry;</i>
<P>

<i>&#183;	what best practice in the advancement of a "case" before a Commission
of Inquiry would require for optimal results, both in
terms of formal
presentation to the Commission and in terms of utilizing other resources or
avenues to advance the case within the
wider sphere.</i>
<P>

<i>[The word `case' is used advisedly.  Naturally a Commission of Inquiry
differs markedly from a court case heard in an adversary system].</i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	In relation to environmental planning, natural resource management,
environmental protection, environmental impact assessment,
project development
and management of approval processors.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	In relation to public, media and political relations.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	In relation to advice given to Ministers and to Government pertaining to
environmental issues.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	In relation to the development and implementation of Government policies
going to environmental related issues.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	In relation to the processes and procedures available to applicants
seeking a re-zoning of land.</i>
<P>

33   	Mr Smyth is plainly qualified to express opinions on a
wide spectrum of areas falling within his above described specialised
knowledge.  This extends to giving evidence as to:  
<P>

<i>(a)	the operation in practice of Commissions of Inquiry into environmental
issues;  </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the forensic tools available to parties interested in such inquiries;
</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The wider field of the political and media resources available to
parties interested in achieving a particular result from a Commission
of
Inquiry, or through the further processes and procedures of Local Government
and State Government, of which processes and procedures,
the inquiry forms only
one stage.</i>
<P>

34   	In addressing the subject objections and the wider
question of the admissibility of the opinions sought to be expressed by
Mr
Smyth (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>) it is necessary also to bear
in mind the clearly established principle that expert witnesses are not
permitted to express opinions
on the basis of unstated assumptions of fact
which are disputed and are to be determined by the tribunal.  In short,
particular precision
requires to be addressed to making explicit those
assumptions upon which expert witnesses rely for the purpose of expressing
their
opinions.
<P>

35   	It is of course plain that a basic objection to any
evidence which an expert seeks to give, is that such evidence must be
able to
be understood in terms.  If the evidence is, as a matter of form, simply not
able to be understood, then the evidence, for
that reason, requires to be
rejected.
<P>

36   	To my mind Mr Smyth has been shown to have specialised
knowledge based on his training and experience and to be qualified
to express
an opinion as to the prospects of persuading the Commission of Inquiry to hand
down recommendations different in kind
or result or emphasis to those in fact
handed down.  Naturally, in order to express any such opinion, Mr Smyth would
require to identify
with precision, the assumptions upon which the giving of
such opinion rests.  In short Mr Smyth, in order to justify his opinion,
would
require to set out in detail precisely what further or different or other
assumed submissions and/or materials he takes into
account as submissions or
material which could and should in his view have been put before the Commission
of Inquiry.  It would also
be necessary for Mr Smyth with precision to identify
precisely what are the further and additional or other recommendations to which
he is referring as recommendations in respect of which he seeks to opine as
having had any, and if so what, chance of coming forward.
<P>

37   	I come then to whether Mr Smyth is qualified to deal
with:
<P>

<i>(a)	The question of whether and if so to what extent the Minister's
undertaking given to the council would have reduced the prospects
of achieving
a re-zoning within a reasonable timeframe.</i>
<P>

<i> </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The question of the impact of the Minister's undertaking in terms of the
suggested requirement that Wollongong City  Council would
have had to be
lobbied to try and open the way for re-zoning, and could have been lobbied to
achieve that result.</i>
<P>

38   	The difficulties which I have are with Mr Smyth's
endeavour to give opinions which are underpinned by his references to Minister
Webster's undertaking.  That undertaking may be regarded as curious in the
circumstances.  This is of course a matter for final submissions
and possibly
for evidence.  It is important to recall that at the time this interlocutory
judgment is being handed down, the plaintiff's
evidence has not been completed
and the defendants' case has not commenced.  The plaintiffs, I note, submit
that the undertaking
was effectively "writ in water", as it was not possible
for the Minister to fetter his discretion in this way.
<P>

39   	The difficulty is that Mr Smyth's endeavour to express
opinions as to the effect of the undertaking, in terms of the suggested
reduced
chances of achieving a re-zoning within a reasonable timeframe, fail a simple
basic test of the requirement that the expert
make plain what he or she is in
fact wishing to say.  If Mr Smyth's evidence is that taking into account the
existence of that undertaking,
then regardless of what different form of
recommendations may have been forthcoming from the Commissioner, it would have
taken some,
and if so what, effort and some, and if so what, time to persuade
any, and if so which relevant officers within the Wollongong City
Council, to
accept the recommendations, then Mr Smyth it seems to me could give such
evidence.  But when Mr Smyth says that in his
opinion "the Minister's
undertaking reduced the chances of achieving a re-zoning within a reasonable
timeframe to the order of 50
percent", I fail to understand in what sense he is
referring to or seeking to take into account, the Minister's said
undertaking.
<P>

40   	To my mind Mr Smyth has not been shown as qualified within
the parameters laid down by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a> of the Act to give evidence as to the
circumstances in which ministers' undertakings given to local councils are
withdrawn or breached
or successfully challenged in Court proceedings. His
specialised knowledge based on his training, study and experience, even
including
his experiences in the inquiries referred to in Annexure A to his CV,
do not extend to embrace these further parameters on which
he seeks to express
opinions.  The opinions which he seeks to express on those matters to my mind
cannot be said to be wholly or
substantially based on his specialised
knowledge.  
<P>

41   	In the event that I be wrong in this holding and assuming
that Mr Smyth would be entitled to give admissible evidence under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a> in
relation to these questions going to the Minister's undertaking, in my view
opinions of that nature ought to be rejected pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, for the reason that the probative value of that evidence
is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly
prejudicial to the defendants, misleading or confusing or cause or result in
undue waste of time.
<P>

42   	The probative value of evidence is defined in the
dictionary of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> as <i>"the extent to which the evidence
could rationally affect the assessment of the  probability of the existence of
a fact in issue".</i>
<P>

43   	Given the definition of "<i>relevant evidence"</i> in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 55</a> (1) of the Act, <i>"probative value"</i>, in substance, means degree
of relevance.  But there is I accept a potentially significant difference
between the definition of relevance
and the definition of probative value.
<P>

44   	In terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135</a> (a) of the Act, to my mind the
concept <i>of "unfair prejudice"</i> to the defendant which here arises is
because the defendants, against whom the evidence is sought to be tendered,
would be based
forensically in an awkward or impossible situation in terms of
the evidence in the form in which it now appears. The difficulty is
essentially
that the Court is simply unable to cope with evidence of this nature.
<P>

45   	To my mind the reasons earlier given appropriately address
the somewhat difficult parameters where an expert is brought forward
to deal
with areas involving political processes, lobbying, and matters which would not
generally be accepted as appropriately the
subject of expert evidence.
<P>

46   	In the result, the rulings of the Court are as follows:
<P>

47   	The first sentence of paragraph 4.2 is rejected.
<P>

48   	Evidence would be allowed, were this able to be given in
admissible form, as to the chances of achieving different recommendations
from
the Commissioner, provided that the words <i>"reasonable period of time"</i>
and <i>"competently and professionally"</i> were first clarified.  The sentence
in its present form may be admissible by being further addressed in chief if
the witness was
to explain the precise stages which the witness has in mind in
endeavouring to use the word <i>"rezoning". </i> The sentence in its present
form does not make explicit those stages.
<P>

49   	The second sentence in paragraph 4.2 is allowed.
<P>

50   	The third sentence in paragraph 4.2 is rejected.
<P>

51   	So much of the final sentence of paragraph 4.2 as
commences with the words <i>"and increase"</i> is rejected.  The balance of the
final sentence of paragraph 4.2 is allowed.
<P>

52   	As to paragraph 14.18, the first sentence is allowed.  The
second sentence is rejected.  I grant leave to the plaintiffs to
adduce further
evidence-in-chief from Mr Smyth, if he is able to give it in admissible form,
to the effect that if the council had
not recommended such a rezoning to the
Minister following the posited Commissioner's recommendation in favour of the
rezoning, the
Minister would have been justified in taking the necessary action
to have the land rezoned.  It would again be necessary to include
in the
evidence precise detail of the stages said to be taken into when the witness
uses the word <i>"rezoning".</i>
<P>

53   	As to paragraph 14.19, that paragraph is rejected.  I
grant leave to the plaintiffs to adduce further evidence from Mr Smyth
in
chief, if this can be done in an admissible fashion.  The words <i>`by now have
been rezoned"</i> plainly refer to a series of assumed steps and results, and
would require to be stated to make explicit what are the assumptions
taken into
account by the witness, or sought to be taken into account in expressing this
opinion.
<P>

54   	I turn then to paragraph 3 in Mr Smyth's report of 18
April 1999.  That paragraph is rejected.  The reasoning processes of
the
witness are not stated.  The assumptions are not stated.
<P>

55   	I turn then to page 23 and 24 of Mr Smyth's statement in
reply of 9 September 1999.  I reject paragraph 137.
<P>

56   	I reject paragraph 138 up to and including the words
<i>"estimated fees based in short from my accumulated experience"</i>.  The
balance of the paragraph is allowed as evidence of the witness' expertise.
<P>

57   	I reject paragraph 139.  I reject paragraph 140.  I reject
paragraph 141.  To my mind the circumstances sought to be relied
upon by Mr
Smyth in endeavouring to extrapolate from his experiences with Leichhardt
Council cases in the fashion dealt with in these
paragraphs gives insufficient
material to permit such an extrapolation, and does not satisfy the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s79</a>
parameters.  If I am incorrect in this, to my mind that evidence ought be
rejected pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> for the reasons that the
probative value of that evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that
evidence might be unfairly
prejudicial to the defendants, misleading, or
confusing, or finally cause or result in an due waste of time.
<P>

<i>I certify that paragraphs 1 - 57</i>
<P>

<i>are a true copy of the reasons </i>
<P>

<i>for judgment herein of </i>
<P>

<i>the Hon. Justice Einstein </i>
<P>

<i>given on 5 November 1999</i>
<P>

<i>and revised on 12 July 2000</i>
