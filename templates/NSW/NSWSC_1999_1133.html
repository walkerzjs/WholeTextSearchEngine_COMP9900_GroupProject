<b>JUDGMENT (On admissibility of evidence relevant to "<i>shunning</i>" -
T2368)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The direction that the evidence of Mr Puplick
is taking which has given rise to an objection is, as I understand
it, that
after the first telecast in 1995 there was a change in the structure of the
AIDS Trust prior to the telecast.  The structure
included a board of governors,
one of whom was the plaintiff, that is, before the telecast sued upon Mr
Marsden had that role in
the AIDS Trust.
<P>

2   	As a matter of fact, as I understand it, after the telecast
the structure of the AIDS Trust was changed with the result that
Mr Marsden was
not a participant. Apparently the change in structure in the light of the
formulation of the question asked of the
witness was founded upon other reasons
or other factors. By that it is to be understood, and by that it can only be
understood that
the change of structure was not generated by anything in
connection with Mr Marsden.
<P>

3   	I do not understand it to be put that the AIDS Trust
structure was changed because of what was telecast about the plaintiff.
It was
going to be changed for other reasons. What is put is that the circumstance of
the change was availed of or used as the opportunity
for bringing it about that
Mr Marsden played no further role in the AIDS Trust.
<P>

4   	Mr Puplick is in a position in my view to give evidence of
the fact of the structure before, the fact of the structure after,
which no
doubt would include, to put it starkly, the absence of Mr Marsden. That
evidence in my view can be given by the witness,
and is relevant to the issue
of whether or not what happened with the AIDS Trust in the end could be found
to be an example of a
shunning of Mr Marsden.
<P>

5   	Pausing there:  whether in the end such evidence would
establish on the balance of probabilities that proposition, would have
to be a
matter of submission.  I am not however persuaded on the relevance point that
there is a basis for excluding it.
<P>

6   	That being so, I turn my mind to the discretions to exclude
evidence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 135</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">136</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>. Implicit in Mr
Nicholas' submission was reliance really upon two components under each
section:  the unfairly prejudicial component,
which I had dealt with in an
earlier ruling but in  a different context (NSWSC 1120: DLJT: 54); and either
the undue waste of time
or misleading or confusing components referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
135</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 136</a> respectively.
<P>

7   	The foundation for the submissions in both areas is that
without what one might describe as the more extensive formalities
of evidence
to show corporate restructuring, board thinking, or the like, (relevant
documentary records), the defendant is in a position
where its capacity to test
Mr Puplick's testimony is compromised to the point where the section should be
availed of to its benefit.
<P>

8   	When, however, one goes back to the considerations that
give rise to the ruling in favour of relevance and the status of this
witness
to give evidence on the matters affecting the AIDS Trust and its restructuring,
and takes into account that it is proposed
to lay groundwork for the drawing of
some inference, I am not presently persuaded that there is either the unfair
prejudice or the
risk of confusion, or waste of time for the purpose of either
of the discretion sections.  I will allow the question.
