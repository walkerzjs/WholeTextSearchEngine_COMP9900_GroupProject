<P>

<b><u>020466/96  JOSEPH SPITERI-v-COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> This is an application by Mr. Spiteri,
the Plaintiff for leave to commence proceedings against the Commonwealth of
Australia, the
Defendant, out of time in respect to injuries he alleged he
received whilst a member of RAAF at Laverton Air Force Base at Victoria
on 31st
January 1986.  The cause of action is negligence.
<P>

2   	The application is opposed by the Defendant basically on
the grounds that material before me fails to establish any causation
between
the accident and the Plaintiff's condition and as a result of the affluxion of
time together with the  unsatisfactory nature
of the medical material in the
records held by the RAAF there is actual prejudice to the Defendant in
attempting to defend this action.
<P>

3   	A statement of claim was filed by the Plaintiff in this
Court on 10th May 1996, the Defendant in its defence claims the Plaintiff's
action is barred by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/loaa1958226/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation of Actions Act 1958</a> Victoria, the Victorian
Act is applicable because the accident relied upon occurred in Victoria.
<P>

4   	The Plaintiff in his application relies on two affidavits
sworn by him on 24th September 1996 and 19th May 1998 respectively
together
with certain exhibits.  The Defendant relies on an affidavit of Mr. Curtis
sworn on 8th May 1998.  Section 5 of the Victorian
Limitations Act restricts
actions in tort to a period of six years from the date in which the cause of
action arose.  Section 23
A (1) relates to claims of the nature of the
Plaintiff's claims.
<P>

<i>SECTION 23A; </i>
<P>

	(1) This section applies to any action for damages for negligence nuisance or
breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue
of a contract or of a
provision made by or under a statute or independently of any contracts or any
such provision) where the damages
claimed consist of or include damages in
respect of personal injuries to any person.
<P>

(2)  Where an application is made to a court by a person claiming to have a
cause of action to which this section applies, the court,
subject to
sub-section (3) and after hearing such of the persons likely to be affected by
that application as it sees fit, may, if
it decides that it is just and
reasonable so to do, order that the period within which an action on the cause
of action may be brought
to be extended for such period as it determines.
<P>

(3) In exercising the powers conferred on it by sub-section (2) a court shall
have regard to all circumstances of the case including
(without derogating from
the generality of the foregoing) the following-
<P>

(a) the length of and reasons for the delay on the part of the plaintiff;
<P>

(b) the extent to which, having regard to the delay, there is or is likely to
be prejudice to the defendant:
<P>

( c) the extent, if any, to which the defendant had taken steps to make
available to the plaintiff means of ascertaining facts which
were or might be
relevant to the cause of action of the plaintiff against the defendant;
<P>

(d) the duration of any disability of the plaintiff arising on or after the
date of the accrual of the cause of action;
<P>

s.23A	
<P>

(e) the extent to which the plaintiff acted promptly and reasonably once he
knew that the act or omission of the defendant, to which
the injury of the
plaintiff was attributable , might be capable at that time of giving rise to an
action for damages;
<P>

(f) the steps, if any, taken by the plaintiff to obtain medical, legal or other
expert advice and the nature of any such advice
he may have received.
<P>

(4) the powers conferred on a court by sub-section (2) may be exercised at any
time notwithstanding- 
<P>

(a) that more than six years has expired since the cause of the action accrued;
or 
<P>

(b) that an action in respect of such personal injuries has been commenced.
<P>

S23A(5) amended by No 57/1989 s3 (Sch. Item 118.2 (a)(b).
<P>

(5) An application under this section shall be made by summons in the
jurisdiction in which an  action has been or is proposed to
be brought and a
copy of that summons shall be served on each person against whom the claimant
claims to have the cause of action,
provided that the Supreme Court may give
leave to bring an action in any court which seems to be appropriate. 
<P>

5   	The facts so far as they were revealed by the evidence
before me is that the Plaintiff when stationed at Laverton Victoria
on 31st
January 1994 was working on constructing metal shelving systems with two other
employees.  It appears the section of a frame
became unstable and began to
fall, the Plaintiff attempted to secure it but it fell and hit him on the head,
<i>see report of accident, Exhibit C. </i> There is no dispute that this
accident occurred but the sequelae alleged is disputed. 
<P>

6   	In dealing first with section 23A3(3)(d) the section as I
understand it relates to the question of causation of the injuries
claimed in
other words what effect if any the injury had on the Plaintiff's neck and to
his lumbar spine. The Plaintiff in evidence
has claimed that since that time he
has had pain in the neck and the lower back, the neck pain is associated with
shoulder and arm
pain.
<P>

7   	The Plaintiff joined the RAAF as a trainee at the age of 18
and this incident occurred about 3 months later. It is undisputed
that during
the whole of his period of time in the RAAF his total treatment for the
injuries he suffered in the course of his employment
was carried out by the
medical staff employed by the RAAF, and the undisputed evidence discloses that
RAAF personal were not encouraged
to seek treatment from civilian doctors. He
was eventually  referred by his superiors to investigations by civilian doctors
determined
by them and at the time this permission was not always granted.
<P>

8   	The Plaintiff gave evidence before me and was
cross-examined by Mr. Rundle who appeared for the Defendant.  In chief he was
asked by his Counsel about incidents such as falling from a ladder in 1986,
three motor vehicle accidents that had occurred and he
alleged in only one
occasion in one of those motor vehicle accidents did he have pain, he said that
lasted for a short time and then
his condition returned to a normal state of
affairs.  He alleged in his evidence he had neck, left arm and back pain from
the time
of the accident until seen by Dr. Compton in 1995.  He confirmed he
never consulted any medical practitioners outside the RAAF and
he was never
told by them of any problems, in answer to a question by Mr. Rundle, he agreed
he never asked for the results of x-rays.
 In any event, even if he had been
told he would probably not be any the wiser as the x-rays did not disclose
serious abnormalities.
<P>

9   	Whilst he agreed he had initially made no complaints about
his condition, he alleged, however, that he complained, as I understand
his
evidence, from time to time to his supervisors and course instructors.  In
particular in 1989 when he was transferred to number
six squadron he complained
to his Commanding Officer, flight Lieutenant Glynn Johnson, and was allowed to
work at light duties. 
<P>

10   	He was cross-examined about an incident in October 1996
when he had reported he had hurt his elbow whilst boxing, he said
whilst that
was a description given in the report he was not in fact boxing but he was
doing boxing training, he did agree, however,
after this incident he complained
of neck stiffness.
<P>

11   	He was asked about his volunteering to go to Somalia with
the Australian forces and agreed such volunteers had to be at peak
physical
condition.  He was rejected, it appears, after some period because he had
suffered a hamstring problem, he said that was
the official reason but was only
part of the reason why he was rejected, he said he was having problems
attempting five mile runs
when he was required to wear a bullet proof vest and
helmet.  He referred to a comment by the Commanding Officer Lieutenant
Commander
Ellis who specifically requested physical treatment for these
problems if he was to be selected in a second group of volunteers which
as it
turned out were not required.
<P>

12   	The totality of his evidence was to the effect that he had
suffered these disabilities from the time of the accident and there
had been no
change in them until the operation performed by Dr. Compton.
<P>

13   	In his affidavit sworn on 19th May 1998 he swore that he
complained on a number of occasions after the injury of pain which
in
particular he suffered on many occasions as I understand his evidence and that
required him to attend sick parade where he would
be seen by either a nurse or
medical assistant and sometimes referred to an RAAF doctor. It is not clear on
the evidence whether
such attendances were noted. If he was required to see a
doctor during the day permission of his instructor or supervisor at the
time
was required but this permission was not always granted.
<P>

14   	 In his affidavit sworn on 24th September 1996 annexures,
records apparently kept by the RAAF in relation to his complaints
and
treatments and those annexures are extensive from A to U. 
<P>

15   	Annexure A  refers to the patient seeking treatment in
respect to the relevant injury, the notation being; 
<P>

<i>Hit on the head with steel shelving, no loc, complains of headaches and
dizziness." </i>
<P>

16   	He was found to be neurologically normal and was said to
have settled with bed rest and head injury observation was normal,
he was
discharged from the hospital on 3rd February 1986 but was re-admitted on 4th
February 1986, Annexure B, when he was said to
be still suffering from
concussion after a head injury when he was hit on the head by a steel pole.  He
complained of persistent
headaches and nausea, vomited once and blurring of
vision, he was given treatment, he was said to have had a normal neurological
examination and was admitted for bed rest, on 5th February it was noted that
his headache had gone but he was still dizzy. He was
discharged on 6th February
1986 .
<P>

17   	Thereafter annexed to the affidavit are photstat records
of various attendances and investigations carried out in respect
to his neck
and back.  The next reference after January 1986 is October 1986, Annexure C,
when there is a note on 24th October 1986,
neck stiffness and medication was
apparently prescribed, noted on 27th October 1986 that the neck was still
painful on and off especially
nocturnally and on sudden movement, left side
radiated to left shoulder blade, slow onset on Friday. A thoraso lumbar x-ray
was undertaken
on 11th February 1987 because of unresolving back pain, this
x-ray disclosed he had a scoliosis to the left, see Annexure D. On 19th
October
1987 he was noted to have a stiff neck after motor vehicle accident three days
previously, and on 23rd November 1987 he had
painful left shoulder, there was a
reference to touch football/ motor accident, neck problems in past,  Annexure
E. On the 11th November
1988 there was a cervical spine x-ray, which failed to
disclose any abnormalities, Annexure F. On the October 1990 he was complaining
of acute lower back pain and left leg, onset at nine o' clock during lifting,
Annexure G, he was complaining on the 17th October
1990 of lumbar spasm and
paraesthesia, Annexure H, a lumbar sacral investigation was carried out, where
it was noted that he had
upper lumber scoliosis concaved to the right, disc
spaces narrowing at L5 S1, this was brought  about apparently because of lumbar
pain in his left leg, Annexure I. It was noted that he'd been seen by a
specialist on referral and had complained of a stiff sore
neck for about a week
with no precipitating event, 22nd February 1995, and on 6th April 1995 there is
a note form the physiotherapist
stating that he attended twice a week for
several weeks for persistent neck pain, he required repeated mobilising to
cervical 3,4
and 5 6, together with ultrasound and soft tissue damage, Annexure
J. On 19th April 1995, Annexure K, he was presenting with recurring
pain, the
left side of neck, radiating to left shoulder, previous anti-inflammatory
medication and physio with minimal effect and
complaining of pain on flexion
and extension of neck, 20th April he's noted to have a why-neck, on 21st April
1995, Nursing Report
request chit for next 7 days, 27th April 1995 cervical
spine x-rays to hand no gross abnormality, long standing cervical pain and
also
arm and leg pain and tingling, that is Annexure K. A Cervical x-ray report of
20th April 1995 referred  to minor reversal of
the mid to lower cervical
lordosis but no disc narrowing was noted, but there was some minimal lipping at
C/6,C/7 and there was some
restriction of flexion and extension, Annexure L. On
27th April 1995 it was noted there was no set pattern to pain, sometimes has
loss of power in the left arm, query whether he needed a CT  of the cervical
spine and brain scan, also 15th May severe muscle spasm
left trapesise, it was
noted that he was currently under examination by a neurologist, Annexure M is a
CT cervical scan 5th May 1995
was performed to  investigate neck pain and no
evidence of any abnormality in the cervical spine was detected and there was no
sign
of intervertible disc protrusion or spinal stenosis at any level the scan
was said to be normal, Annexure N.  On 14h May he complained
 of  neck and left
shoulder pain and that that pain continued, it was noted that he was seeing a
specialist it was said the pain
had got worse since last night and pain relief
isn't working.  He had a limited range of movement, on 17th May he was noted to
have
been complaining of left neck and arm pain, CT scan, head and neck did not
disclose any abnormality. On the 18th May, no improvement
with pain, not coping
at work and needs admission to Ward 2 for analgesics, Annexure O. On 16th May
1995 the report of a CT scan
was noted but there was no abnormalities detected,
Annexure P.  On the 23rd May 1995 he was examined by a neurosurgeon, for
complaints
of left shoulder and arm pain, CT, left cervical spine disc
protrusion at C5/6, query need for surgery or further investigation,
Annexure
Q. Dr. Compton, a specialist neurosurgeon, said that the MRI certainly was
suggestive that he had a disc prolapse at C5/6,
and Dr. Compton noted a long
history of neck trouble, the doctor believed that the MR undertaken was
suggestive  of a C5/6 prolapse
and because he had not improved with
conservative treatment further investigation was required and surgical options
should be considered,
Annexure R.  A cervical myleogram was undertaken and a
report of that myleogram on 30th May 1995 from the Castlereagh Radiology stated
the findings were consistent with the left  posterior lateral disc protrusion
together with other associated problems, Annexure I.
 He was seen again by Dr.
Compton on 2nd June 1995 when it was noted he had some trouble on the right
side on that occasion, the
main problem was still on the left, he had a disc
and osteryphite problems, on 8th June 1995 surgery was recommended for a
posterior
lateral C5 disc protrusion, a fusion was performed, spinal surgery
was undertaken on 7th June 1995 for a left posterio-lateral disc
protrusion,
Annexure T.
<P>

18   	One of the live  issues in this application is whether
there  is credible evidence to enable the relationship of the neck
problems,
shoulder problems, back problems to be related to  the incident of January
1986. The Plaintiff submits that the totality
of the evidence before me
discloses for the purposes of this application that there is such credible
evidence, the Defendant on the
other hand submits that I would not be so
satisfied, submitting amongst other matters in evidence before me the Plaintiff
exaggerated
his condition and was not frank and truthful in answers to
questions put by Mr. Rundle, the Plaintiff complained before me that he
has had
problems since the accident. There was no dispute he was a fit young man prior
to the accident, the records show, as I have
pointed out, that over the years
although there are gaps there has from time to time been complaints about his
neck pain, arm pain
back pain and complaint  of loss of power would, if
accepted,  suggest some disc involvement. As a starting point it is not
disputed
that the blow to the head in January 1986 was to the frontal parietal
area and I infer it was a severe blow, causing him to suffer
 concussion that
required hospitalisation on two occasions. I note in Dr. Aroney's report,
Annexure B to the affidavit of Mr. Curtis
that  the weight of the object that
hit him was said to be in the vicinity of 30 kilograms. It  is thus  a matter
of common sense
to infer that that is the type of injury that could cause or
could initiate problems in his neck. The neck could then go on over
the years
to degenerate and maybe suffer exacerbations of the underlying condition, if
however, the injury initiated the degeneration
then in my view there is
evidence of causation to the original injury.
<P>

19   	This is not atypical case of an industrial skeletal injury
heard in Courts engaged in  awarding compensation for personal
injuries. There
are many occasions when a condition not  initially disabling initiates a
condition in an otherwise healthy spine
the spine then degenerates over the
period causing serious disabling problems. In such cases the accuracy and
truthfulness of the
Plaintiffs evidence and/or of other witnesses as to the
history of the condition since the accident is vital. 
<P>

20   	Whilst it may be said that the Plaintiff has exaggerated
the degree of symptoms he has suffered the question of his credibility
is one
to be considered by the Trial Judge not by me.  I am of the opinion that it
would not be open to me in the circumstances on
the material before me to
conclude that his evidence was such that could not be accepted by a tribunal of
fact. I point out again
that  the injury to his neck  appeared to be severe. I
am not of course seized with all the evidence that may be called at the
Hearing.
<P>

21   	In addition Exhibit B is from an organisation described as
The Military Compensation and Rehabilitative Service, dated 16th
December 1996,
in respect to the Plaintiff's claim for compensation for a spinal condition.
That document testifies to the fact that
it was found on the available evidence
that the Plaintiff had suffered an injury arising out of the course of his
military service,
namely a C5/6 disc protrusion and chronic lumber spine injury
on 31st January 1986, it was noted that the Defendant had admitted
liability
for that condition. Documentation on that base  was tendered by the Defendant.
It  said that his condition could be considered
as caused by repeated minor
trauma and subsequent degeneration. On the history before me the major trauma
in this case is the injury
that we are dealing with. 
<P>

22   	Dr. Lawson, a very experienced Consultant Physician in a
report of 5th July 1996, Exhibit A, refers in particular to the problems
the
Plaintiff  suffered at work, page 2, he concluded, page 7, that the Plaintiff
had severe and lasting effects from the injury
he sustained in the accident in
January 1986. I should note, also, that Dr. Compton, report 3rd May 1986,
Exhibit A, refers to his
long history of neck trouble.
<P>

23   	 I am therefore of the opinion that there is sufficient
evidence to establish causation of the injury to his disabilities.
In
considering the other matters required to be considered under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a>, 23A(3)(a) it should be emphasised that the Plaintiff was in the hands of
the Defendants medical advisers throughout<b>,</b> and it was not until he had
the fusion operation that he became aware of the serious nature of his
condition.  He thereafter sought
permission to have an MRI test as recommended
by Dr. Compton instead he was ordered by the authorities to undergo
rehabilitation,
see paragraph 11 to 13 of his affidavit, sworn on 19th May
1998, he then sought legal advice on 20th December 1995, the statement
was
filed in Court on 10th May 1996.  Up until the time of operation the evidence
discloses he had no idea he had a disc prolapse
being told he had a pinched
nerve.  In my view in all the circumstances the delay in instituting the
proceedings has been satisfactorily
explained.  
<P>

24   	I am satisfied for the purposes of this application that
when he became aware of the serious nature of his condition he sought
advice,
the delay from June to December in  receiving legal advice in all the
circumstances here is reasonable, see also 23A (3)
(e) I believe is wrapped up
in the answer to Section 23A (3)(a), in respect to 23A (3)( c), the evidence
discloses until the final
diagnoses was made the Defendant took no steps to
make available material to the Plaintiff that might be relevant to his cause of
action.  In relation to 23A (3) (d), it appears he had problems on and off over
the years but did not consider that that they were
serious and was able
generally to carry on his duties in the RAAF. In relation to 23A (3) (f), he
was subject to the advice of the
RAAF. Authorities, in all the circumstances I
am satisfied that that having regard to those matters he has given satisfactory
explanations.
<P>

25   	The last matter submitted by the Defendant was that
pursuant to section 23A (3)(b), that  there is prejudice to the  Defendant
in
defending this action because of the delay in this matter. The evidence on this
matter, relied on by the Defendant is contained
in the annexures to the
affidavit of George Curtis, Solicitor, sworn 8th May 1988., Mr. Curtis in
paragraph 5 asserts that due to
the lengthy delay in the commencement of these
proceedings, the Defendant <cite>"would"</cite> be greatly prejudiced and it
would be extremely difficult for his office to properly investigate the
Plaintiff's initial injuries
and their causal link to the operation in 1995.
There is no evidence of any attempt made by the legal representatives of the
Defendant
to investigate these matters and determine if evidence is available,
the matters relied on do not lead me to the conclusion that
such evidence is
not available. A number of medical reports were tendered to  this affidavit to
establish this prejudice, namely
from Professor R. Mitchell, 29th  April 1998,
Dr. M.Aroney,4th May 1998, Dr. J. Shand 5th May 1998, A B and C<b>.
</b>Annexure D is a letter to the Plaintiff's solicitors, setting out the
material sent to the doctors in question.
<P>

26   	 Professor Mitchell in his report notes it would be
difficult for the Defendant to obtain medical evidence firstly because
of the
delay involved and secondly the multiple Air Force personnel involved in the
case. Mr. De Burg who appears on behalf of the
Plaintiff submits this is an
assertion and there is no evidence to suggest that any such attempts have been
made, as I referred to
earlier. 
<P>

<u>27   	</u>Dr. Aroney in page 3 in his report of 4th May 1998
as have referred to earlier had a history of a 30 kilogram shelf hitting him on
the right frontal parietal area, at page 5 under the heading Discussion he
agrees it is possible the accident did lead to some neck
injury and he agrees
however that because of the passage of time <u>there is some difficulty,
(</u>the emphasis being mine), in being able to properly investigate all
aspects of his medical condition allegedly due to the accident
in 1986. He
refers to the motor vehicle accident in October 1987 as important, he refers to
the lost chance of interviewing him shortly
after the accident,  this assumes
the Plaintiff would have commenced proceedings in that early period, and he
states an examination
closer to the time of the accident could certainly lead
to more accurate opinion, I certainly do not see this material as leading
me to
conclude that it was not possible for the doctor on the evidence contained in
the reports in the Defendants hands and in the
evidence that the Plaintiff
would give in Court to be able to give an opinion. Once again there is a great
deal of speculation in
this report
<P>

28   	Dr. Shand referred to his psychological problems and said
that psychiatry assessment 12 years later by means of relevant documents
can
provide no opportunity and the inability to carry out an up to date examination
makes it difficult to determine the causation.
If the matter proceeds Dr. Shand
will have an opportunity to have an up to date medical examination. Whilst I
concede it would be
more difficult for the Defendants and for that matter the
Plaintiff to run their respective cases, the question posed is whether
from the
Defendants point of view it is not possible to have a fair trial, as I have
said earlier it appears that no attempts have
been made up to the time of the
swearing of the affidavit to investigate the matters in those circumstances
difficult to conclude
there is prejudice in the Defendant or if there is
prejudice that it is significant prejudice.
<P>

29   	The Defendant in its submission relies on the <i>Brisbane
South Regional Authority -v-Taylor, 1996(186)CLR page 541 </i>in  particular
the judgment of McHugh J. In that decision, Toohey_and Gummow JJ, referring to
the discretion in the Queensland legislation
under review concluded in
exercising a discretion to grant leave to commence proceedings out of time, a
material consideration is
whether by reason of the time elapsed a fair trial is
possible.
<P>

30   	In  <i>Sydney City Council -v-Zegarac 1998(43)NSW LR page
195</i> the NSW Court of Appeal considered the approach to be taken in these
circumstances and the ramifications of the finding of prejudice
 in such
applications. The Court there held that proof of actual prejudice even
significant prejudice caused by the delay in bringing
the action outside the
limitation period does not necessarily dictate the rejection of an application
for extension of time, Mason
P. at page 199 in considering the NSW Limitations
Act said: 
<P>

<i>" I would hold that proof of actual prejudice or even significant prejudice
does not dictate the rejection of an application for extension
of time''</i>
<P>

31   	His Honour went on further:
<P>

<i>" all the circumstances of the case must be taken into
consideration."</i>
<P>

32   	He went on to say:
<P>

<i>evidence of actual or significant prejudice may lead to a refusal of the
application on the particular circumstances of the case.</i>
<P>

33   	His Honour concluded his remarks in this respect by saying
in weighing prejudice  its import upon a fair trial is the primary
focus, ,
<i>see also Priestly J A, at page 221</i>, as Powell J A pointed out, the
application will succeed if in the opinion of the Judge it is just and
reasonable to do so.
<P>

34   	In all the circumstances in this matter I am not satisfied
that the material in front of me has  resulted in such  a delay
as to prevent a
fair trial. I am not satisfied that in the circumstances significant prejudice
of such a nature is such in this case
to prevent a fair trial of the issues to
be litigated, there is a considerable volume of medical evidence in the hands
of the Defendant,
indeed, one might say, all the relevant medical evidence.  It
must be borne in mind at all times that he was treated by the Defendants
medical advisers.  The evidence is they did not see fit to inform the Plaintiff
of any medical problems until the Limitation term
expired, indeed it could be
said that the medical investigations carried out until 1995 did not disclose a
serious medical condition
of such a nature that would alert the Plaintiff to
the fact that he should take action for damages. 
<P>

35   	Even if one were to accept prejudice as being established
in my view it is not such that would inhibit a fair trial. The Defendant
has
not placed any material before me as to what investigations they have made by
the evidence, there are obvious lines of inquiry.

<P>

36   	I therefore make order (2) in the Notice of Motion. I
grant leave to the parties to further mention the matter to make any
further
orders sought.
<P>
