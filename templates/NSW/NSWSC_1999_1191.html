<b><u>TOMARA HOLDINGS PTY. LTD.  V.  PONGRASS &amp; ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff Tomara Holdings is the owner of a
property 16 Pearce Street, Double Bay, which adjoins the property
2A Castra
Place, Double Bay, owned by the defendants Mr Pongrass and Mrs Clunes-Pongrass.
The plaintiff's property has the benefit
of a right of way over part of the
defendants' property, giving access from Castra Place to the rear of the
plaintiff's property.
This right of way was created by a transfer in 1961, and
contains certain conditions numbered (a) to (f). The defendants gave the
plaintiff notice pursuant to those conditions on 12 March 1999, indicating an
intention to revoke the right of way unless the notice
was complied with. 
<P>

2  	By its summons in these proceedings, the plaintiff seeks a
declaration that that notice was invalid, and consequential relief,
and also
seeks an order modifying the easement to remove conditions (b) to (d). The
defendants have put on a cross-claim seeking
an order that the plaintiff remove
certain encroachments on the easement, and consequential relief, and also
orders extinguishing
or modifying the easement pursuant to S 89 of the
Conveyancing Act.
<P>

3  	In relation to the s.89 orders sought by the defendants, for
reasons given in a short judgment delivered earlier today that
matter is not
being determined today, but will be dealt with later when further evidence has
been put on by both sides.
<P>

4  	I will briefly outline those facts which are not in dispute.
<P>

5  	The easement which was created by a transfer from the then owner
of 2A Castra Place, was expressed to be subject to the following
conditions:
<P>

<b><i>(a)	That the said Transferees shall at their own cost and expense keep
the said carriage way in repair.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)	The said Transferees shall have the right to remove the existing
dividing fence between the lands of the said Transferor and
Transferees.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)	That if the said Transferees shall remove the existing dividing fence
then the said Transferees shall at their own cost and expense
erect a suitable
dividing fence and gate between the land of the said Transferor and the said
Transferees within one month after
the said Transferor shall give notice in
writing to the said Transferees so to do.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(d)	The existing gate at the entrance to the carriage way from Castra
Place shall not be removed by the said Transferees and shall
be kept in repair
by the said Transferees at their own costs and expense and shall be kept closed
whilst the carriage way is not
being used by the said Transferees.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(e)	The right-of-carriage way hereby granted shall enure so long only as
the preceding conditions are observed and performed by the
said Transferees and
the grant thereof may be revoked by the said Transferor by notice in writing at
any time after the Transferees
have failed to rectify any breach or
non-observance of such conditions within one month after the Transferor shall
have given notice
in writing requiring such breach or non-observance to be
rectified.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(f)	It is hereby agreed and declared that in the preceding clauses (a) to
(e) inclusive the word "Transferees" shall mean Bernard
and Yetta Goldstein of
16 Pearce Street, Double Bay or any other registered proprietor for the time
being of the land comprised in
Registered Certificate of Title Volume 2465
Folio 40 and the word "Transferor" shall mean Leah Pearce of Double Bay or any
other
registered proprietor for the time being of the land comprised in
registered Certificate of Title Volume 1953 Folio 244.</i></b>
<P>

6  	The plaintiff acquired its property in 1969; while the defendants
acquired their property pursuant to a contract dated 27 September
1997, which
was settled on 27 March 1998. It is common ground that at that time there was
no gate in place at the entrance to the
right of way from Castra Place.  There
was a dividing fence between the right of way and the plaintiff's property
consisting of timber
paling, a wire mesh gate and certain wire mesh fencing;
and there was a driveway constructed along the right of way, which was at
a
slightly lower level than the plaintiff's adjoining land. 
<P>

7  	It appears  that in about February 1999, the vehicular crossing
to the right of way was in disrepair, and the defendants arranged
with the
Woollahra Municipal Council to reinstate it at a cost of $1,297.00.  
<P>

8  	The notice which I referred to earlier was given on 12 March
1999, and it was in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>We, </i></b><cite>NICOLAS ANDRU PONGRASS and LEIGH-ANNE
CLUNES-PONGRASS</cite><b><i> being the joint registered proprietors of the
property comprised in Certificate of Title Folio Identifier 111/632155 and
known as
2A Castra Place, Double Bay </i></b><cite>HEREBY GIVE YOU
NOTICE</cite><b><i> that you are in default in failing to comply with the
conditions of the easement created by Memorandum of Transfer H982926 which
dealing creates an easement for right of way over land adjoining our property
owned by your Company comprised in Certificate of Title
10/4412 and known as 16
Pearce Street, Double Bay in that you have failed to comply with paragraph (d)
of the conditions by:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)	failing to agree to reimburse to us the cost of repair of the
entrance driveway, and</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)	failing to undertaking (sic) to reinstate gates as referred to in
paragraph (d) and in respect of which we have provided to you
a quotation to
establish gates which would be acceptable to us.</i></b>
<P>

<cite>NOW YOU ARE FURTHER HEREBY GIVEN NOTICE</cite><b><i> that if you fail to
rectify the non-observance of these conditions within one month after the date
of receipt of this notice then
we will by further notice to your Company revoke
the right of way pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (e)
thereof.</i></b>
<P>

9  	It appears that on the same day, that is 12 March 1999, surveyors
engaged by the defendants attended at the easement, and in
the course of their
work removed some or all of the paling fence dividing the easement from the
plaintiff's property, and took down
the wire mesh gate. It seems that later
that month, the remainder of the wire mesh fence was taken away, though the
evidence is not
entirely clear as to the circumstances in which that happened.

<P>

10  	On 24 March 1999, the plaintiff paid the defendant the $1,297.00
sought by the defendants' notice. 
<P>

11  	These proceedings were commenced on 27 April 1999.
<P>

12  	It appears that there are also proceedings between the plaintiff
and the defendants under the Dividing <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fa67/" class="autolink_findacts">Fences Act</a> at a Local Court, in which the
issue will be the nature of a suitable fence between the easement and the
plaintiff's property.  The
contention of the defendants will be that it should
be a brick fence; while the contention of the plaintiff will be that it should
be a paling fence, and that in substance the plaintiff should have to
contribute to the cost only to the extent of one half of the
cost of a paling
fence.
<P>

13  	The issues debated before me are essentially the present and
continuing effect of the easement in relation to the gate between
Castra Place
and the easement, and the dividing fence between the easement and the
plaintiff's property; and secondly, the encroachments
alleged to exist from the
plaintiff's property on to the easement, and whether any order should be made
in respect of them.
<P>

14  	With respect to the first issue, there is a factual question
concerning the circumstances in which there came to be no gate
between Castra
Place and the easement. 
<P>

15  	There is in evidence a photograph of a gate which, according to
a director of the plaintiff, Tamara Barrientos, existed prior
to 1983. I see no
reason to doubt that this photograph does correctly show a gate existing
between Castra Place and the easement
prior to 1983. 
<P>

16  	Ms Barrientos also gave evidence that in or about 1983, when she
was about 13 years old, she observed work being carried out
on the defendants'
property which included the demolition of a cottage on that property, the
building of a new house, the lowering
of the level of the driveway on that
property, and the removal of the gate. Ms Barrientos gave evidence that she saw
the previous
owner of the defendant's property, Mr Scarf, speaking to the
contractors involved in those operations. She gave evidence that the
plaintiff
was not involved in the removal of the gate.
<P>

17  	Ms Barrientos was cross-examined by Mr Gullotta for the
defendants, and ultimately conceded that the only matter she was certain
about
in relation to the removal of the gate was that it was removed; but in my
opinion that did not remove the basis in her evidence
for the Court accepting
the other matters which I have outlined. In the course of cross-examination, Ms
Barrientos mentioned that
she had spoken to Mr Scarf; and it emerged in
re-examination that this was a recent conversation. I indicated at the time
that I
would not give weight to that evidence, unless I was satisfied that it
arose out of the cross-examination. I have to say that the
position is not
entirely clear in my mind whether it did fairly arise out of cross-examination
or not; and as I am satisfied, for
reasons I will give, from other evidence
that the gate was in fact removed by the defendants' predecessor in title, I
will not rely
on that particular piece of evidence.
<P>

18  	Ms Barrientos' mother was in court and did not give evidence. Ms
Barrientos was asked a reason for this, and said that her
mother would not be
able to readily stand up to giving evidence in this Court. 
<P>

19  	Mr Gullotta submitted that I should not be satisfied by this
evidence that the gate was removed by Mr Scarf. He submitted that
it did not
exclude the possibility that it was removed at the instigation of the
plaintiff, or that the contractors did it of their
own initiative.  He pointed
to a benefit to the plaintiff that could have come from the removal the gate,
namely, easier access,
particularly for tenants who gained access to their part
of the plaintiff's house by a set of stairs adjacent to the right of way.
 Mr
Gullotta submitted it would be uncommon for an owner to remove his own gate. He
also relied on the failure of the witness' mother
to give evidence,
particularly in circumstances where the witness herself was only 13 years old
at the time the events happened.

<P>

20  	Taking into account all those matters, it still seems to me that
I should accept Ms Barrientos' evidence that the gate was
removed by
contractors at a time when Mr Scarf was undertaking extensive work on his own
property, including work on the driveway
and the building of a new house, and
that those contractors were seen talking with Mr Scarf. Accepting that
evidence, I think there
is a clear inference that the court should draw that
the gate was removed as part of this enterprise by Mr Scarf, and I do draw that
inference. 
<P>

21  	I might say Mr Walker also sought to rely on an admission
contained in a letter written by Mr Pongrass. I do not give any weight
to that
admission. It seems to me that that is fairly regarded as responding to an
assertion made on behalf of the plaintiff, in
circumstances where at the time
Mr Pongrass did not know one way or the other what the true situation was.
<P>

22  	The next question is what effect does the easement have in
circumstances where the gate was removed by the defendants' predecessor
in
title. 
<P>

23  	Mr Gullotta, as I understand it, accepted that in those
circumstances the defendant couldn't, by notice, require the plaintiff
to
install a new gate. However he did submit that once a new gate was installed,
the terms of paragraph (d) of the easement would
apply to the new gate, and
that the plaintiff would be obliged to keep that new gate in repair.  He also
submitted that, should I
not be satisfied as to who removed the gate, the terms
of paragraph (d) would apply to require the plaintiff to reinstate the gate.
Because of the finding of fact I have made, that question does not arise; but I
would indicate that in my opinion the obligation
in paragraph (d) upon the
plaintiff to ensure that the "existing gate"  be "kept in repair"  would  not
extend to installing a new
gate if the existing gate was removed by persons
unknown.
<P>

24  	Mr Gullotta provided short written submissions concerning the
construction of paragraph (d), which I will leave with the papers.
He submitted
that "repair" included "restore", and that the intention to be derived from
paragraph (d) was to cast responsibility
for the maintenance of the gate in
situ wholly upon the transferees of the easement and their successors in
title.
<P>

25  	In my opinion paragraph (d) does only apply to the "existing
gate", and that in circumstances where that gate was removed by
the defendants'
predecessor in title, paragraph (d) can have no further application. 
<P>

26  	In relation to paragraphs (b) and (c), Mr Walker submitted that
those paragraphs also had no further application. He submitted
that, even if
the plaintiff was responsible for removing part of the existing fence,
nevertheless the whole matter dealt with by
paragraph (b) and (c) had been
overtaken and subsumed in the dividing fences dispute being dealt with by the
Local Court, and was
really governed by the provisions of the Dividing <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fa67/" class="autolink_findacts">Fences
Act</a>.  
<P>

27  	In my opinion, in circumstances where the Dividing <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fa67/" class="autolink_findacts">Fences Act</a>
proceedings are progressing and where the precise responsibility in relation to
the removal of the existing fence has not, to my
satisfaction, been clarified,
I should not make any finding one way or the other as to whether paragraphs (b)
and (c) have any continuing
application. I would merely remark that, on a
realistic approach, the defendants wished to have a new fence erected, and was
responsible
for at least part of the removal of the existing fence. It seems,
therefore, unlikely that the situation which has actually arisen
is a situation
intended to be dealt with by paragraphs (b) and (c). However, I am not prepared
to either remove (b) and (c) or make
a declaration that they can have no
further application.
<P>

28  	The other main issue in the case concerns the existence of
encroachments, and what if anything should be done about them. 
<P>

29  	There is evidence from the defendants that the original dividing
fence was on the defendants' land, that is upon the easement,
and that the
fence was in part set in a concrete footpath which extends into the easement at
a height greater than the driveway along
the easement. There is also evidence
that there are tree roots from the plaintiff's land encroaching on to the
easement. However,
the survey evidence which has been provided is not clear as
to the extent of the encroachments.  There indeed seems to be some
inconsistencies
between Annexures P4 and P5 to Mr Pongrass' affidavit.
Annexure P4 refers to a  small concrete ramp placed upon the easement and
adjacent to the plaintiff's property, and it is possible that that ramp was
placed there so as to enable the carriageway to be used
for access to the
plaintiff's property notwithstanding the lowering of the level of the
carriageway by the defendants' predecessor
in title. 
<P>

30  	In any event, it seems that the nature and placing of the
dividing fence will have a significant effect upon exactly what is
done at the
boundary between the plaintiff's property and the easement. Furthermore, there
is evidence from Ms Barrientos that the
plaintiff has at all times been ready
willing and able to remove any encroachment but has not received the authority
necessary to
enter on to the defendants' land to do  so, and that the plaintiff
has not been provided with any quote for such work to be done
by the
defendants' contractors.  There is in evidence a letter apparently sent by Mr
Pongrass dated 24 March 1999 dealing with the
question of encroachment; but
having regard to the totality of the state of evidence to which I have referred
and to the impending
dividing fences proceedings, in my opinion a case has not
been made out by the cross-claimants for an injunction requiring the plaintiff
to remove the encroachments.
<P>

31  	For those reasons, what I propose is that I make a declaration
that the notice of 1 March 1999 is invalid in respect of paragraph
(b) of that
notice. I do not see any necessity to restrain the defendants from revoking the
easement:  plainly, in the light of that
declaration and in the light of the
previous payment of $1,297.00, the defendants are not entitled to revoke the
easement. I do not
propose to make any order modifying the easement, but I do
propose to declare that paragraph (d) of the easement has no continuing
effect.
In relation to the cross-claim I would propose dismissing paragraphs 1, 2 and
3, and paragraphs 4A and 4B would be stood
over to a later date.
<P>

32  	In relation to costs, Mr Walker seeks an order for the costs of
proceedings to date, and also seeks an order that at least
some of the costs be
on an indemnity basis. He has referred me to an offer of compromise in relation
to paragraphs 1 to 3 of the
cross-claim, whereby what was offered was that the
plaintiff pay the defendants $560 and that there be no order as to costs.  This
was followed up by a further document on 29 November.
<P>

33  	My decision on paragraphs 1, 2, 3 of the cross-claim has not
been on the basis that the defendants have no rights in relation
to the removal
of the encroachments, or that such rights as they have are of no value or of
any value less than or equal to $560.00.
 It rather is that, in the
circumstances outlined, I did not think a case was made out for the
intervention of the Court to order
the plaintiff to take any particular action
at the moment in relation to those encroachments.  The defendants retains
whatever rights
they have in relation to the encroachments.  For that reason, I
do not think this material impacts significantly on the discretion
as to costs,
and I will not order indemnity costs.
<P>

34  	For the defendants, Mr Gullotta has submitted that a substantial
part of costs have been incurred in relation to the interpretation
and the
continuing effect of a document created by someone other than the defendants,
and that in respect of those matters the defendants
have had some success.
There is some force in that submission, but in my opinion the occasion for
these proceedings is essentially
the notice of 12 March 1999, and in relation
to matters connected with that notice the plaintiff has been entirely
successful. I
don't think the other matters have really added anything
significant to the costs of the proceedings.
<P>

35  	The orders that I will make will only relate to the cost of the
proceedings to date.
<P>

36  	The relief sought in paragraphs 4A and 4B of the amended
cross-claim can still be pursued, and costs in relation to that will
no doubt
follow the event of those claims. However, because of the way in which those
claims came to be adjourned, I do not think
that justifies any diminution in
the costs order in favour of the plaintiff for the proceedings to date. 
<P>

37  	For those reasons, these are the orders I make.
<P>

38  	I declare that the notice of default dated 12 March 1999 by the
defendants to the plaintiff in respect of easement created
by transfer H982926
is invalid as regards paragraph (b) of that notice. 
<P>

39  	I declare that paragraph (d) of the said easement is of no
further effect. 
<P>

40  	Otherwise I dismiss the summons. 
<P>

41  	I dismiss paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the amended cross-claim. 
<P>

42  	I order that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of the
proceedings to date. 
<P>

43  	In relation to paragraphs 4A and 4B, 5, 6 and 7 of the amended
cross-claim, I stand the cross-claim over to 7 December 1999
before the
Registrar.
<P>

44  	The exhibits may be returned.  
<P>

45  	In relation to the documents produced on subpoena by the
Woollahra Municipal Council both parties can have photocopy access
to those.
