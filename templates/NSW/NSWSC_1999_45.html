<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff (AGT) has instituted, by Summons, proceedings against the first
to eighty-eighth defendants (Clayton Utz) and the
eighty-ninth defendant Mr
Buckworth (Assessor).
<P>

2	The relief sought is a Declaration that Clayton Utz failed to comply with
their obligations to the plaintiff and those imposed
by Pt 11 Div 2 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act, 1987</a></i>;  alternatively, a Declaration is sought that
the Costs Agreement dated 21 February, 1995 issued by Clayton Utz to the
plaintiff
is "<i>unjust</i>".  An order is sought remitting the decision made
by the Assessor on 6 December, 1996 to him.  
<P>

3	The Assessor, has filed an appearance submitting to the order of the Court,
save as to costs. 
<P>

4	The plaintiff had retained Clayton Utz to act on its behalf in relation to a
number matters and from time to time the defendants
delivered bills of
costs.
<P>

5	On 12 September, 1996 the plaintiff applied to this Court for an assessment
of those costs pursuant to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s199.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 199</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act, 1987</a></i> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>").  The assessment was referred to the Assessor
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s206.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 206(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  
<P>

6	It appears that during the course of the assessment the plaintiff argued
first, that the defendants had failed to comply with
the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s177.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
177(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> in that the costs agreement entered into between the
plaintiff and the defendants did not contain an estimate of the likely amount
of the costs of legal services to be provided.  Secondly, it was argued that
the Costs Agreement was "<i>unjust"</i> and should be set aside pursuant to the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208D</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  The assessor duly issued a certificate on 14
November, 1996 stating that the submissions on the Costs Agreement being unjust
had
been considered by him and determining that the Costs Agreement was not
"<i>unjust</i>". 
<P>

7	The proceedings in this Court are said to be way of appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> which
provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	A party to an application who is dissatisfied with a decision of a
costs assessor as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine
the application may, in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, appeal
to the Court against the decision.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	After deciding the question the subject of the appeal, the Supreme
Court may, unless it affirms the costs assessor's decision:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs assessor ; or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the
costs assessor to re-determine the application.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)	On a re-determination of an application, fresh evidence, or evidence in
addition to or in substitution for the evidence received
at the original
proceedings, may be given".</i>
<P>

8	Consequent upon the <i>Legal Profession Reform Act, 1993</i> a new regime in
relation to costs as from 1 July, 1994 came into effect.  The Act requires a
solicitor to disclose certain matters
to the client in relation to the costs of
legal services to be provided insofar as it is presently relevant, s 175(2)
requires the
disclosure of the basis of calculating the costs.  
<P>

9	Section 177(1):   <i>"A barrister or solicitor must disclose to a client in
accordance with this Division an estimate of the likely amount of the costs
of
legal services to be provided to the client by the barrister or solicitor, if
the amount of the costs is not disclosed under section
175".</i>
<P>

10	Section 178(1) requires that the relevant disclosures be made before the
solicitor is retained to provide the legal services
concerned subject to
sub-section (2) which is concerned with the circumstances where it is not
reasonably practicable to make the
disclosure prior to the solicitor being
retained. 
<P>

11	Section 184 of the Act provides for the solicitor and client to enter into a
costs agreement which may, in turn, form part of
a contract for the provision
of legal services.  Section 184(6) provides for the making of a costs agreement
by way of a written
offer which is accepted in writing or by conduct.  
<P>

12	Section 179(2) provides that the required disclosures may be made in a costs
agreement.
<P>

13	Section 181 provides for the making of, <i>inter alia</i>, solicitors rules
in relation to the circumstances in which it is or is not reasonably
practicable to make the required disclosures.
 
<P>

14	On 1 July, 1994 solicitors rules made by the Council of the Law Society of
NSW pursuant to s 181 commenced.  These rules provided
that, <i>inter alia</i>:

<P>

	<i>"1.2	For the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s181.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 181</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a>, the
circumstances in which the disclosure of the information required by sections
175 and 177 of the Act will be considered to be
not reasonably practicable,
will include those circumstances in which a practitioner receives instructions
from, or is consulted
by, a person -</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	...</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	...</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	...</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	who seeks the provision of a legal service which can be, or needs to
be, performed immediately or soon after instructions for
it are given;</i>
<P>

<i>	and there is no reasonably practicable opportunity to provide the specified
information in writing before the practitioner has performed
all, or a
significant part, of the legal services required".</i>
<P>

15	On 1 December, 1994 the Council made a further rule providing that:
<P>

	<i>"1.3	For the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s181.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 181</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a>, the
following Rules have effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	1.3.1	Where a practitioner has -</i>
<P>

<i>	1.3.1.1	agreed to provide to a client legal services as they are specified
and required by the client, and charge for them at a declared
rate, or on an
agreed basis; and </i>
<P>

<i>	1.3.1.2	disclose to the client the intended billing arrangements and the
other information required by section 175 of the Act; </i>
<P>

<i>	it will be deemed to be not reasonably practicable for the practitioner to
disclose more information under sections 175 and 177 while
that agreement
continues in force".</i>
<P>

16	It is common ground that there was a costs agreement between the plaintiff
AGT and Clayton Utz which complied with s 175 of the
Act and that various bills
of costs were rendered by Clayton Utz to AGT for legal work performed. 
<P>

17	The plaintiff now claims that the assessor erred in law in rejecting the
contention that Clayton Utz had breached s 177 of the
Act and further he erred
in law in failing to set aside the Costs Agreement as unjust pursuant to s 208D
of the Act. 
<P>

18	For the plaintiff it is submitted that the briefest inspection of the Costs
Agreement reveals that there is no estimate of the
costs likely to be incurred
and that therefore one starts with a prima facie position that s 177 was not
complied with.  Before the
assessor, Clayton Utz sought to justify its failure
to give an estimate by reference to a rule of the Law Society.  
<P>

19	The position begins with s 180, exempts a solicitor from having to make an
estimate where it is not practical to do so.  Section
181 provides that the
solicitors rules may make "<i>provision for or with respect to </i>...<i> the
circumstances in which it is or is not reasonably practicable to make a
disclosure under the Division</i>".
<P>

20	Solicitors Rule 1.3.1 provides:
<P>

	<i>1.3.1	Where a practitioner has -</i>
<P>

<i>	1.3.1.1	agreed to provide to a client legal services as they are specified
and required by the client, and charge for them at a declared
rate, or on an
agreed basis; and </i>
<P>

<i>	1.3.1.2	disclose to the client the intended billing arrangements and the
other information required by section 175 of the Act; </i>
<P>

<i>	it will be deemed to be not reasonably practicable for the practitioner to
disclose more information under sections 175 and 177 while
that agreement
continues in force".</i>
<P>

21	It is contended by Clayton Utz that the fee agreement of 21 February, 1995
is a 1.3.1 fee agreement.  For the plaintiff it is
asserted that it cannot be
doubted that that is what the agreement <i>purports</i> to be.
<P>

22	However the subject matter of the Clayton Utz retainer, it is said, was such
as to make inapplicable Rule 1.3.1.  That rule,
it is submitted, is concerned
with the situation which obtains where a firm of solicitors performs many
sundry items of ongoing business
for a particular client.   The proposition
that a major piece of injunctive litigation in the Federal Court involving the
retaining
of senior counsel can be classified as "<i>sundry"</i> needs only to
be stated to be exposed for its implausibility; there is a world of difference,
it is said, between a chain of unrelated
sundry matters and a significant piece
of commercial litigation.  The plaintiff contends the Clayton Utz's invoking of
Rule 1.3.1.
fails to grapple with that difference.
<P>

23	In the event that Clayton Utz can correctly invoke Rule 1.3.1 in the
circumstances, then it is submitted that 1.3.1 is invalid.
 It is a piece of
delegated legislation under s 181.  A Regulation may not contradict the statute
from which it derives its authority.
 Section 180 exempts a practitioner from
giving an estimate where it is not practicable to do so.  There was nothing in
the circumstances
of this case which made it impracticable to give an estimate.
Rule 1.3.1 does not apply in a case such as the present, if it did
it would be
invalid.  
<P>

24	Thus in those circumstances it is said there was a failure to disclose
contrary to the provision of s 177.
<P>

25	For the defendant it is contended that AGT faces an almost insuperable
hurdle in demonstrating that the assessor erred in law
in relation to the
allegation that Clayton Utz contravened s 177.  The assessor made no such
finding nor are there any reasons for
his determination that the Costs
Agreement was not "<i>unjust</i>".  It is submitted that there is no need for
the assessor to make a finding as to whether s 177 was breached.  It was open
to the
assessor to decide that the Costs Agreement was not unjust irrespective
of whether s 177 was breached or not.
<P>

26	A failure to comply with s 177 does not of itself, it is submitted, amount
to a breach of the Act (s 183). Accordingly, a failure
to comply with s 177
cannot <i>necessarily</i> render a costs agreement unjust.  It follows
therefore that the determination by the assessor that the Costs Agreement was
not unjust
does not of itself demonstrate that the assessor considered that
there was a failure to comply with s 177.  He may have found that
there was a
breach, but one which, in the circumstances of the case, was insufficiently
serious to render the Costs Agreement unjust.
 Alternatively he may have found
that there was no breach of s 177.  The record states nothing.  In either case
however, it is submitted,
AGT can point to no error in point of law to found an
appeal under s 208L which relates to the alleged contravention of s 177.
<P>

27	The defendant contends that there was compliance with the precise terms of
Solicitors Rule 1.3.1 and that this was, in fact,
as is clear from its
submissions, accepted by AGT.  
<P>

28	The defendants perceive AGT's position to be that it contends that the rule
was only concerned with situations where "<i>a firm of solicitors performs many
sundry items of ongoing business for a particular client</i>".  There is
nothing to support such a contention because the rule is clear.  The rule
addresses circumstances where the solicitor
has agreed to provide the client
with legal services as they are specified and required by the client;  the
solicitor has agreed
to charge for those services at a declared rate;  and the
solicitor has disclosed all other matters required to be disclosed by s
175 of
the Act.
<P>

29	It is submitted when a client makes an agreement with a solicitor for the
provision of legal services "<i>as they are specified and required by the
client</i>" the solicitor is not in a position to know whether there will be
many or few occasions when the client will require such services.
 "<i>Many
sundry items of ongoing business</i>" may eventuate;  alternatively, only a few
matters may eventuate.  It cannot be the case that in the event that the client
ultimately
only requests legal service in relation to a single matter, Rule
1.3.1 no longer applies to the solicitor who then becomes obliged
to provide a
s 177 estimate. 
<P>

30	Whether or not the agreement falls within the scope of Rule 1.3.1 must be
determined at the time the agreement is entered into,
and by reference to the
terms of the actual agreement.  It is incorrect, it is submitted, to read into
the rule an implied requirement
for the performance of "<i>many sundry items of
ongoing business</i>" - not merely because there is nothing in the rule to
justify that implication, but also because the question whether the implied
requirement will be satisfied cannot be known at the time the Costs Agreement
was entered into. 
<P>

31	As to the question of validity of Rule 1.3.1:  the Solicitors Rules may make
provision with respect to the circumstances in which
it is reasonably
practicable to make a disclosure (s 181).  What is reasonably practicable is
clearly a sub-class of what is practical:
 <b><i>Marshall v Gotham </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%20AC%20360" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954)
AC 360</a> at 373</b> per Lord Reid:  "<i>there may well be precautions which it is
practical but not reasonably practical to take"; </i> see also 369 per Oaksey
LJ.
<P>

32	In <b><i>The King v Archdall &amp; Roskruge</i></b><i> </i><b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2041%20CLR%20128" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 41 CLR
128</a> at 140</b> Higgins J stated:  "<i>As so often happens in recent
legislation, such an issue as `reasonableness' is left to the tribunal, without
any guidance from the
legislature;  and the tribunal has to weigh all the
circumstances in order to decide the issues for itself in each particular case.
It is not a question of law;  it is rather a question of general social
standards</i>".  (See also per Knox CJ, Isaacs, Gavin Duffy and Powers JJ at
136.)
<P>

33	So in s 181 has left it to the drafters of delegated legislation who are
likely to be aware of the realities of the situation
to specify the
circumstances in which disclosure would not be reasonably practical. 
<P>

34	There is no suggestion that those who drafted the Solicitors Rules did not
hold a bona fide belief that in the circumstances
of Rule 1.3.1 disclosure
would not be reasonably practical.  Moreover there are good reasons for
considering that to be so particularly
in the case of commercial litigation.
Commercial matters, it is said, tend to follow a far more unpredictable course
than conveyancing,
wills and personal injuries litigation.  In this very
matter, for example, agreements passed through multiple drafts.  New questions
arise from time to time.  Unanticipated issues arise in the course of
litigation.  In theses circumstances, the provision of a meaningful
estimate is
extremely difficult.
<P>

35	The rule however ensured that AGT was at all times aware of the basis upon
which the services it required would be charged, and
of its other rights and
obligations in relation to those costs.  
<P>

36	It is submitted that in any event the Court has only limited power to
declare the rule invalid.  Validity will be presumed: 
see <b><i>Gibson v
Mitchell </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2041%20CLR%20275" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 41 CLR 275</a> at 279</b> where Isaacs J stated (on the
question whether a regulation was necessary or convenient for carrying out the
Act):  <i>"primarily (the words necessary or convenient) signify what the
Governor-General may consider necessary or convenient and no court
can overrule
that unless utterly beyond the bounds of reason and so outside the power"</i>.
Similarly in the case of Rule 1.3.1 AGT faces the obstacle of demonstrating
that the drafters of the rule could not reasonably have
considered that the
circumstances which it specifies are circumstances in which disclosure is not
reasonably practicable.
<P>

37	As to the question of whether under s 208D the Costs Agreement should be set
aside the plaintiff contends that there are two
matters which justify that
course.  
<P>

38	First, there was the failure by Clayton Utz to comply with s 177, a
significant matter.  In effect in a case where there was
no reason of
practicality not to give an estimate Clayton Utz escaped giving one.  The
purpose of the amendments to the Act was to
allow informed decisions to be
made.  Not to give an estimate in such a case effectively interfered with that
aim and the breach
was therefore a significant one.
<P>

39	Secondly, the Costs Agreement it is contended was hopelessly misleading.  It
contained the following, it is submitted, curious
passage:
<P>

	<i>"One provision obliges a lawyer to provide an estimate of the costs of a
matter before the lawyer is retained in relation to the matter,
let alone
commence work.  Whilst the provision of the estimate can be deferred in some
circumstances the requirement has proved to
be impracticable in the commercial
arena.  </i><cite>This is particularly so where there is an ongoing
relationship between the lawyer and the client</cite><i>.  </i>
<P>

	<i>Accordingly the regulations have been amended to remove this requirement
where the lawyer has agreed to provide the client with legal
services as they
are specified and required by the client and to charge for them at a declared
rate or on an agreed basis.  </i>
<P>

	<cite>In order to comply with the new requirements</cite><i> it is necessary
for us to vary our existing costs agreement</i>" (emphasis added).
<P>

40	Two things follow, it is said.  At the time the document was written the
plaintiff had retained Clayton Utz for under one month
and in respect of one
matter:  namely, a request to draft a single page letter.  At the time the fee
agreement was sent, Clayton
Utz were not, in fact, retained to do anything.  To
describe a professional relationship which consists solely of the drafting of
a
single page letter as an ongoing relationship does violence to the English
language.  Secondly, the statement that the regulations
"<i>required</i>"
Clayton Utz to amend its agreement is false.  The regulations require no such
thing.  Accordingly, the fee agreement (a) referred
to an ongoing relationship
which did not exist and (b) represented that it was necessitated by a
regulation which necessitated no
such thing.
<P>

41	In those circumstances the Costs Agreement should have been set aside as
being unjust.  
<P>

42	Clayton Utz notes that AGT does not allege that the assessor's decision is
flawed because he failed to take into account a relevant
consideration or
because he took into account an irrelevant consideration.  Indeed, the assessor
expressly took into account the
written submissions made on behalf of AGT of 29
October, 1996 which related to the alleged contravention of s 177 and the
misleading
nature of the Costs Agreement.  It must be taken that in determining
whether or not the Costs Agreement was "<i>unjust</i>" within the meaning of s
208D the assessor had regard to those arguments.
<P>

43	The assessor's determination that the Costs Agreement was not unjust and
should not be set aside is a question of fact not of
law, it is submitted.  It
may be accepted that often the question whether facts have been fully found
fall within the provisions
of a statute properly construed is a question of
law, however:  "<i>special considerations apply when we are confronted with the
statute which on examination is found to use words according to their
common
understanding and the question is whether the facts as found fall within these
words...". </i> <i>The only question raised was whether the appellant's
behaviour was `insulting'.  As it was not unreasonable to hold that his
behaviour
was insulting, the question was one of fact</i>":  <b><i>Hope v
Bathurst City Council </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144 CLR 1</a> at 7</b> per Mason J.
<P>

44	Similarly the only question raised here whether the costs agreement was
"<i>unjust</i>" is also a question of fact.  It therefore follows so, it is
contended, that the appeal is not properly brought under s 208L but
requires
leave.
<P>

45	Moreover, AGT is required to demonstrate that the assessor's determination
was so unreasonable as to permit the Court to interfere
with his discretion:
"<i>the limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative
discretion must constantly be borne in mind.  It is not the
function of the
court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by
exercising a discretion which the legislature
has vested in the administrator.
Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion and a decision
made within those boundaries
cannot be impugned":  <b>Minister for Aboriginal
Affairs v Peko Wallsend </b></i><b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 24</a> at 40-41 </b>per Mason J.
This is said to be another hurdle AGT is unable to surmount.
<P>

46	In any event, even if this Court were exercising again the discretion
conferred on the assessor no different result would follow.
 The letter is not
"<i>hopelessly misleading</i>" as is put by AGT in its submissions.  It appears
that AGT from the perspective of the defendant is advancing two bases to
support
this proposition:  first, it contends that the reference to an ongoing
relationship is misleading.  On a fair reading of the letter,
it is clear that
the letter does not describe the relationship between AGT and Clayton Utz as an
"<i>ongoing relationship</i>" but merely refers to a particular set of
circumstances (an ongoing relationship) which created particularly difficulties
in complying
with the legislation.  Secondly, the inclusion of the words "<i>in
order to comply with the new regulations</i>" is also said to be "<i>hopelessly
misleading</i>".  The suggestion that the regulation required the parties to
enter into a new agreement is, it is submitted, extraordinary.  When
the
sentence is read as part of the letter as a whole, it is clear that the need to
comply with the new regulations arises if and
only if, the parties were willing
to bring themselves within the provisions of the new rule.
<P>

47	AGT was free to reject the Costs Agreement which was offered.  Furthermore,
the Agreement expressly provided that "<i>needless to say, we are happy to
provide you with an estimate of the likely costs involved in a particular
matter on request</i>".  AGT never made any such request.
<P>

48	Finally, even had the assessor been minded to set aside the Costs Agreement
there is no basis for the assertion that the scale
rate should be applied.  The
Act requires the assessor to determine an amount which is <i>"fair and
reasonable" </i>for the legal services provided.  The hourly rate specified in
the Agreement are reasonable rates well within the range of rates for
firms
specialising in commercial work.  
<P>

49	For reasons shortly to be stated, it is unnecessary for the Court to
consider the resolution of the substantive claims for declaratory
relief.
<P>

50	Nonetheless, I do state that the submissions for the defendant Clayton Utz
are persuasive.  I would be inclined to accept the
submission that any failure
to comply with s 177 of the Act would not, of itself, amount to a breach of the
Act (s 183(1)).  Further,
any failure to comply with s 177 would, in my view,
were I in a position to decide it, not bring it about that automatically a
costs
agreement would necessarily be "<i>unjust</i>'.  In any event, I would
not be persuaded that there was non-compliance with s 177 by reason of the
application of r 1.3.1.  Further,
the validity of the rule, I would otherwise
hold to be not impugned for the reasons advanced in the course of argument.

<P>

51	The more difficult area adverted to in the course of submissions is whether
or not the finding by the assessor that the Costs
Agreement was not
"<i>unjust</i>" was a finding of fact or law:  there being an appeal as of
right on a question of law and an appeal by leave otherwise (ss 208L
and 208M).
One would be inclined to the view that a decision by a person who may be acting
either judicially or in the performance
of an administrative function as to
whether an "<i>agreement"</i> between parties is "<i>unjust</i>" could be
characterised as a decision on a matter of law, but one founded upon findings
of fact made in the light of evidence tendered
before the decision maker.  It
is the absence of reasons that makes the resolution of this aspect difficult if
not impossible.
<P>

52	At the conclusion of oral submissions before me on 18 August 1997, counsel
for Clayton Utz drew to my attention a decision of
Sperling J handed down on 1
August 1997 in <b><i>Kennedy Miller Television Pty Limited v J S Lancken &amp;
Anor</i></b> (unreported).  In that decision his Honour held that there was an
obligation upon the assessor to give reasons.  In the instant matter
of course
the assessor did not give reasons nor was he asked to give reasons and, indeed,
made clear his position that he would entertain
no further submissions from the
parties on the issue of the "<i>just/unjust</i>" agreement upon his having
ruled that it was not "<i>unjust</i>".
<P>

53	The decision of Sperling J was the subject of an appeal to the Court of
Appeal and judgment in this matter was deferred pending
the outcome of that
appeal dealing as it did with a critical matter.  The appeal was heard on 25
February 1998 and the judgment of
the Court (Priestley JA, Handley JA, Powell
JA) was delivered on 30 June 1998 and it is now reported  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 729.</a>
The parties to the proceedings before me were invited to provide further
submissions in the light of the judgment of the Court of
Appeal.
<P>

54	The proceedings before Sperling J and indeed before the Court of Appeal,
proceeded on the assumption that the function performed
by the assessor was
administrative in nature.  It was held by the Court of Appeal that there is an
obligation on a Costs Assessor
to give reasons for determinations.  It being
assumed that the Costs Assessors function is administrative, Pt 11 Div 6 of the
Act
provides the kind of "<i>special circumstances"</i> in which statutory
provisions should be construed so as to impose upon the decision-maker an
implied duty to provide reasons.  At
p 735E Priestley JA said:  "... <i>it
seems very clear that unless the Costs Assessors are to be obliged to give
reasons for their determinations, the appeal provisions
are likely to be,
although not completely useless, so close to it as to negate the clear intent
that in regard to questions of law
at any rate a party dissatisfied with the
Costs Assessor's decision should have a real and not largely illusory right of
appeal".</i>
<P>

55	In brief written submissions dated 28 August 1998 it was contended for the
plaintiff that the decision of the Court of Appeal
as to the absence of reasons
provided a basis for allowing the appeal.  In submissions dated 31 August 1998
it was contended for
Clayton Utz that the principles expounded by the Court of
Appeal do not apply as no request for reasons was made of the assessor.
<P>

56	As I have intimated above, the absence of reasons, in my view, precludes a
determination of the substantive declaratory relief
sought.  I am of the view
however, that the decision of the Court of Appeal makes it quite clear that
irrespective of whether or
not a request for reasons is made, an assessor is
obliged to give them, <i>a fortiori</i>, in my view, in respect to a finding
that a costs agreement is not "<i>unjust</i>".  
<P>

57	In these circumstances the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought in
orders 3 of the Summons remitting the matter to the
eighty-ninth defendant, the
Assessor.  In the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal the provision of
reasons as to the Determinations
dated 14 November 1996 (determination that
agreement not urgent) and 6 December 1996 (determination as to quantum) is
required.
<P>

58	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The application for assessment of costs is remitted to the eighty-ninth
defendant for the purpose of his providing reasons for
his Determination dated
14 November 1996 that the Costs Agreement is not unjust;
<P>

2.	That the assessment of the practitioner/client costs dated 6 December 1996
is remitted to the eighty-ninth defendant for the
purpose of his providing
reasons for his Determination.
<P>

3.	The first to eighty-eighth defendants (Clayton Utz) are to pay the costs of
the plaintiff.
<P>

4.	Liberty to apply on 7 days notice.
