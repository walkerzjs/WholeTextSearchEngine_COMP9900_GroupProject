<P>


<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 18 June 1995 police were advised
that a body had been located at the base of the cliffs at Watsons Bay in
Sydney.  The body was
identified as that of Caroline Byrne, who had died from
injuries sustained when she fell from the Gap.  In due course, a coronial
hearing was convened.  After taking evidence, the Senior Deputy State Coroner
(the Coroner) on 11 February 1998 found that Ms Byrne
died on or about 7 June
1995 at Watsons Bay of multiple injuries sustained when she impacted with the
rocks below the Gap but, as
to how she came to impact with those rocks, the
evidence adduced did not enable him to say.  When the Coroner announced these
findings
in open court he added -
<P>

"With an open finding, the police, I can assure you, are still interested -
very interested - in it and will be seeing whether they
can take the matter any
further.  They know that the Coroner is still very interested in it and for
that reason alone will analyse
the evidence and see what more can be done.  If
anything comes out, of course they will follow it up."
<P>

This is not language indicative of a conclusion of an inquest, as distinct from
a hearing or series of hearings.  
<P>

2   	Some time after this, certain information came to the
attention of police who communicated it to the Coroner.  For present
purposes,
what happened is sufficiently stated in a press release issued on 22 October
1998 at the Coroner's direction in the following
terms -
<P>

"The NSW Senior Deputy State Coroner, Mr John Abernethy, today reopened his
inquest into The Death of Caroline Theresa Byrne.  Caroline
Byrne was found at
the foot of "the Gap" Watsons Bay on 8 June 1995.  In February this year the
Coroner recorded an open finding
as to the circumstances of her death.
<P>

"The Coroner today heard evidence of the detail of the ongoing police
investigation which was requested by him at the conclusion
of his inquest into
Caroline Byrne's death.  He heard evidence from a senior police officer
attached to the Homicide and Serial Violent
Crime Agency Crime Agencies NSW
Police Service and formed the opinion that such evidence, and the detail of the
ongoing police investigation
, if placed in the public domain will be likely to
seriously compromise such investigation so as to be likely to adversely affect
the proper administration of justice.  
<P>

"He therefore, on adjourning his inquest generally, ordered pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act 1980</a>, in the following terms -
<P>

That all evidence given this day at inquest into the death of Caroline Theresa
Byrne be not published until further order of the
Court".
<P>

It is clear, and indeed the Coroner himself said so at the reopened inquest,
that he received the further evidence comprising the
statement of the relevant
police officer together with certain annexures at the suggestion of the
officers investigating the matter.
 This material, the Coroner said, was
prepared "in order to make a decision about whether to reopen this inquest".
The Coroner stated
that he was "re-opening my inquest" which was "concluded on
11 February this year" with an "open finding".  He added that when he
brought
in the open finding, he referred the inquest papers to the Crime Agency of the
NSW Police Service because, "I was far from
satisfied that I had been presented
with the entire picture in relation to the circumstances of the death . . ."
and that he had
been "particularly interested in having the evidence reviewed
by experienced homicide investigators with a view to considering and
advising
me whether, in their view, further investigation should take place".  His
Worship said that it was decided to undertake
further investigation which was
ongoing and which had then reached "an extremely sensitive stage".
<P>

3   	The Coroner said that he had been reliably informed that
there was a likelihood that publication was imminent of an article
in the press
"on the essence or nature and details of the continuing investigation".  He
said that, upon receiving and considering
advice from the New South Wales Crown
Solicitor, he determined to re-open the inquest, hear evidence from the police
as to the investigation,
and the likelihood of publication about it and ensure
that the investigation was not compromised by such publication.  His Worship
formed the opinion that "the present investigation on my behalf is extremely
sensitive and that publication of its details and its
nature may be likely to
adversely affect the administration of justice within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a>,
particularly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 5</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">5</a>, of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</i> 1980</a>" (the Act) and
consequently made the suppression order.  The Coroner then adjourned the
inquest.  
<P>

4   	Having regard to what the Coroner himself said and, anyway,
to what actually occurred, it is obvious that the essential reason
for
reconvening the inquest in a public hearing was to make the suppression order.
It is also clear that, so far as the terms of
the order itself are concerned,
no one who was ignorant of the substance of the statement of the officer and
its annexures could
know what the evidence was which was not permitted to the
published.  The Coroner directed the executive officer to forward a press
release to the media liaison officer of the Attorney General's Department, the
New South Wales Police Service media unit and AAP,
and also specifically
mentioned the editor of the Sun Herald.
<P>

5   	Not surprisingly, the plaintiff, which owns the Sun Herald,
wrote to the executive officer on 23 October 1998 asking him to
disclose the
evidence given at the hearing which was suppressed to enable the effect of the
order to be understood.  It is not contested
that no reply was given.  On 22
October 1998 the Sun Herald published a number of statements which, it is
alleged, were in breach
of the non-publication order.  The informations do not,
however, assert that the source of the published information was the evidence
tendered in the coronial hearing on 22 October 1998.  
<P>

6   	For completeness, I should note that, as it happened, the
Coroner convened another hearing on 24 December 1998 from which all
"civilians"
were excluded and all the evidence was again subjected to a non-publication
order.  
<P>

7   	The plaintiff seeks a declaration, in effect, that the
Coroner, in all the circumstances, did not have any power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> of the Act
to make the order to which I have referred.  It is not, however, sought to
litigate before me whether the order is invalid
by virtue of its terms or
whether any offence was committed by the publication of the material
particularised in the informations.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 44</a> of the Act provides -
<P>

"(5)	A coroner holding an inquest or inquiry may, if of the opinion that it
would be in the public interest to do so, order:
<P>

(a)	all or any persons to go and remain outside the room or building in which
the inquest or inquiry is being held, or
<P>

(b)	that any evidence given at the inquest or inquiry being held by the coroner
not be published. 
<P>

(6)	For the purposes of subsection (5), in forming an opinion as to the public
interest, a coroner may, without limitation, have
regard to the administration
of justice, national security or personal security."
<P>

It will be seen that the order that material not be published is confined to
"any evidence given at the inquest . . . being held
by the coroner".  The
jurisdiction, powers and duties of coroners are confined to those conferred or
imposed on them by or under
the Act <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 8)</a> together with all necessary
incidental powers.  The jurisdiction exercised in this case by the Coroner was
conferred on him by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> of the Act, arising as it did in the circumstances
described in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(1)(a)</a> (a violent or unnatural death), (b) (a sudden death the
cause of which is unknown) and/or (c) (dying under suspicious or unusual
circumstances).  The relevant procedures are governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the Act, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
17</a> of which requires the coroner to fix a time and place for the commencement
of the inquest and give particulars of the same to various
persons.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18</a>
requires the inquest to be held before a coroner without a jury subject to
irrelevant exceptions.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19</a> applies where a person has been charged with
an indictable offence or evidence given at the inquest establishes a <i>prima

permits a fresh inquest concerning a death to be held even though a prior

into a death where an application has been made by specified persons and the

however, that this provision does not limit or otherwise affect any other power
of a coroner to hold a fresh inquest. 
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 30</a> requires the room or building

by counsel or a solicitor and to examine and cross-examine any witnesses.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 33</a> provides that a coroner is not bound to observe the rules of
procedure and evidence applicable to proceedings before a court of law
but even

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 34</a> requires a deposition of every witness at an inquest to be recorded.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 35</a> permits the issue by the coroner of a summons for appearance of a

power to a coroner to punish for contempt and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ca1980120/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 44</a>, to which I have
already referred, (amongst other things) permits a coroner holding an inquest
to order persons to leave the hearing
room and order that evidence given at the
inquest be not published.  
<P>

8   	It will be seen from this brief survey of the procedural
structure in which the coroner's jurisdiction is exercised that his
or her
essential function is to conduct a hearing in the presence of interested
persons and of the public with a view to answering
the statutory questions.
The Act does not give the coroner any jurisdiction to conduct an investigation,
as such.  He or she is enjoined
by the Act to hold an inquest.  Insofar as it
may be incidental to the exercise of that jurisdiction, there can be no doubt
that
the coroner has a power to investigate and to request others to make
relevant investigations.  This is in marked contrast to the
coroner's original
functions. Sir James Stephen, in his <i>History of the Criminal Law of
England</i> (McMillan &amp; Co, (1993) Vol I, Ch VII at 217 ff) relates the
history of coronial inquests, pointing out that they comprised the
"earliest
instance that occurs of any set of preliminary inquiry into crimes with a view
to subsequent proceedings".  The investigative
function in respect to
suspicious deaths was fundamental to the Coroner's jurisdiction.  Stephen notes
that the "inquisition of the
coroner always was and still is [as at 1882] a
formal accusation of any person found by it to have committed murder and
manslaughter
. . . and a person may be tried upon such an inquisition without
any further accusation".  The supersession of these duties is adverted
to in
<i>Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Waller</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 1.</a>  The function of
investigating crime as such was emphatically removed from the coronial
jurisdiction in New South Wales by the 1960
Act, and designedly so, as
reference to the Parliamentary debates on the Second Reading, set out in
<i>Attorney-General v Maksimovich</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 300</a> at 305 ff, makes
clear.  The purpose of investigations from the Coroner's point of view, is to
permit the inquest to be conducted
for the purpose specified in s 13 of the Act
and, subject to the considerations in s 44 and the exceptional circumstances
referred
to in s 32 concerning representation, in a public hearing involving
the participation of persons with a sufficient interest in the
subject matter
and relatives of the deceased.  It is necessary to consider carefully the
setting and purpose of ss 44(1) and (5)
of the Act.  Section 44(1) is in the
following terms -
<P>

"(1)	A coroner holding an inquest or inquiry may order:
<P>

(a)	any witness or all of the witnesses to go and remain outside the room or
building in which the inquest or inquiry is being held
until required to give
evidence, or
<P>

(b)	that any evidence given at the inquest or inquiry being held by the coroner
be not published."
<P>

This provision (and s 44(5), set out earlier) overcomes the doubt noted by
Kirby P (as he then was) in <i>Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2
NSWLR 47</a> at 55 ff) as to the general power of the courts (as distinct from
particular matters in limited circumstances) to make orders operating
outside
the court suppressing the publication of anything said open court and, by
extension, anything tendered in open court in documentary
form (cf <i>John
Fairfax &amp; Sons v Police Tribunal</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 456</a> at 471-2).
Although, generally speaking, apparently unqualified powers given by statute to
public officials can only be exercised
to enable that official to appropriately
fulfil his or her function, section 44(5) of the Act is not so limited.  Whilst
the coroner
can only make an order if he or she is satisfied that it would be
in the public interest to do so, ss 44(6) permits the coroner in
forming that
opinion to "without limitation, have regard to the administration of justice,
national security or personal security".
 It seems to me that the effect of
this provision is to permit the coroner to order that evidence given at an
inquest not be published
where the public interest might be adversely affected
in the specified respects, whether or not the course of the inquest itself
might be compromised.  However, such an order can only be made where an inquest
is being held and the exclusive purposes of such
an inquest are (relevantly)
set out in s 13 of the Act, the material provisions of which I have summarised
above.  The submission
made by the plaintiff is correct, therefore, that
holding an inquest for another purpose, namely solely to make an order under s
44 of the Act, is not authorized by the Act and that any orders made in such an
event are without jurisdiction and void.  
<P>

9   	That, however, does not dispose of the question here.  As I
have already mentioned, although the jurisdiction of coroners is
now determined
by the Act, it does not constitute a code and it is necessary to consider the
extent of the incidental powers which
are necessary for the proper
administration of the coronial function:  <i>Maksimovic v Walsh</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20NSWLR%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2
NSWLR 656</a> at 662.  The coroner's involvement in the investigation of a
suspicious death is, in my view, incidental to the exercise of the jurisdiction
to hold an inquest and is not an independent function.  In <i>Mirror Newspapers
v Waller</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 1</a> at 16, Hunt J said - 
<P>

"At least one of the coroner's functions, in particular, would make an
observance of the usual rules of procedure and evidence an
impossibility.  I
refer to the coroner's residual investigatory function.  Historically, the
coroner investigated all cases of sudden
death.  He did so because his duties
originally were fiscal in nature, and the unnatural death of a citizen could
produce revenue
to the Crown.  According to the <i>Statute De Officio
Coronatoris</i>, of 1276, the coroner was obliged to determine where such a
person was slain, who was present and who was guilty.  Since the establishment
of a regular police force, this investigatory function of the coroner has been
largely, but not entirely, superseded.  According
to a report of the Chief
Justice's <i>Law Reform Committee</i>, submitted in 1964 (and published in
Appendix B to the <i>Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Coroners Act,
</i>1960 (LRC 22 1975)) a coroner's inquest is still used as an aid to the
police, in order to afford them an opportunity of furthering
their
investigations by the examination and perhaps cross-examination of witnesses
under oath (par 3 at 88).  That was the nature
of the inquiry which the coroner
was conducting in the present case in the "preliminary part" of the inquest
into the death of Mrs
Watson, and which was the subject of the prohibition
order pursuant to s 44(1)."
<P>

It is worth noting that the views expressed by his Honour about the appropriate
circumstances in which to make a non-publication
order were influenced by the
then statutory requirement to hold the inquest in public, permitting exclusion
from the hearing only
of witnesses, as provided in s 44(1)(a).  Section
44(5)(a) now extends this power to "all or any persons" with the consequence
that,
despite the provisions of s 30 requiring an inquest be open to the
public, where the public interest requires it, the coroner may
proceed in
camera.  The rules adapted from the mode by which the ordinary courts exercised
their power to hear matters in the absence
of the public which was limited to
those circumstances where "the publicity which would be afforded by reports of
those proceedings
by the news media would frustrate or render impracticable the
administration of justice" (<i>ibid</i> (1985) 1 NSWLR at 20) does not apply to
a coroner's court which may also have regard to national or personal security
under s 44(6)
of the Act.  These latter considerations do not, in terms at
least, arise here since the Coroner imposed the order upon the ground
expressly
that publication of material that had been tendered would adversely affect the
administration of justice.  There was, for
obvious reasons, no disclosure by
the Coroner of the ways in which he apprehended the administration of justice
might be adversely
affected.  Having regard to the view that I have formed as
to the jurisdiction to make the order, I do not propose to expose in this
judgment the circumstances that might have led to this conclusion.  Having
regard, however, to the nature of the case, the evidence
given which led to the
open finding and to the particulars in the informations, it is possible to
discern a number of proper bases
from which such a conclusion might properly
have been drawn.  I should point out that the attack mounted by the plaintiff
in this
case is aimed at the existence of the jurisdiction of the Coroner's
Court to make the order in the circumstances rather than any
error of law
causing the exercise of that jurisdiction to miscarry.  Even so, these
questions are not entirely disconnected.

5 NSWLR 465</a> at 476-477, McHugh JA said -
<P>

"The fundamental rule of the common law is that the administration of justice
must take place in open court.  A court can only depart
from this rule where
its observance would frustrate the administration of justice or some other
public interest for whose protection
Parliament has modified the open justice
rule.  The principle of open justice also requires that nothing should be done
to discourage
the making of fair and accurate reports of what occurs in the
courtroom.  Accordingly, an order of a court prohibiting the publication
of
evidence is only valid if it is really necessary to secure the proper
administration of justice in proceedings before it.  Moreover,
an order
prohibiting publication of evidence must be clear in its terms and do no more
than is necessary to achieve the due administration
of justice.  The making of
the order must also be reasonably necessary;  and there must be some material
before the court upon which
it can reasonably reach the conclusion that it is
necessary to make an order prohibiting publication.  Mere belief that the order
is necessary is insufficient.  When the court is an inferior court, the order
must do no more than is "necessary to enable it to
act effectively within" its
jurisdiction.  Courts have no general authority, however, to make orders
binding people in their conduct
outside the courtroom.  Judicial power is
concerned with the determination of disputes and the making of orders
concerning existing
rights, duties and liabilities of persons involved in
proceedings before the courts.  An order made in court is no doubt binding
on
the parties, the witnesses and other persons in the courtroom.  But an order
purporting to operate as a common rule and to bind
people generally is an
exercise of legislative - not judicial - power.  Nevertheless, conduct outside
the courtroom which deliberately
frustrates the effect of an order made to
enable a court to act effectively within its jurisdiction may constitute a
contempt of
court.  But the conduct will be a contempt because the person
involved has intentionally interfered with the proper administration
of justice
and not because he was bound by the order itself.  I think that the above
statement of the applicable principles is in
accordance with the way in which
this branch of the law has developed."

11   	In <i>Mirror Newspapers v Waller</i>, Hunt J pointed out
(at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 25)</a> -

"I am satisfied that the publication by the news media of reports of the
proceedings in this `preliminary part' of the inquest would
constitute a
serious denial of natural justice to those persons named in the proceedings if
they were not represented during those
proceedings.  The publicity to be given
to the allegations to be made during those proceedings would in my view
necessarily require
that the coroner should not have permitted them to be made
without affording natural justice to those persons in the way which I
have
already outlined.  This, it seems to me, would have the inevitable effect of
frustrating or rendering impracticable the very
purpose for which the witnesses
were to be called, which was to enable the police to test their reliability
before deciding whether
to pursue their allegations any further.
<P>

That is my own view.  But, whether I am right or wrong in coming to that
conclusion, it was certainly open to the coroner to come
to the same conclusion
and to decide, upon the basis of that conclusion, that to permit the
publication by the news media of reports
of that part of the proceedings would
frustrate or render impracticable the administration of justice. . ."
<P>

The jurisdiction of the coroner's court to make non-publication orders may be,
at all events, wider than that of the ordinary courts
for reasons independent
of ss 44(1) or (6).  
<P>

Section 44(5) gives the Coroner's Court a specific power to make
non-publication orders binding persons not connected with the proceedings
in
respect of their conduct outside the courtroom, limited only by the requirement
that the power only be exercised where it is in
the public interest to do so,
having regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the administration of justice.  I am of
the view that a proposed or potential publication which would constitute a
contempt by
virtue of its "tendency to interfere with the due administration of
justice in particular proceedings, unless the possibility of
interference is so
remote or theoretical that the principle <i>de minimus no curat lex</i> should
be applied" (<i>Attorney General v Mirror Newspapers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 NSWLR 374</a> at
387) could appropriately be subjected to a non publication order under s 44(5)
so that, for example, "the publication of statements,
by persons likely to be
called as witnesses, about the matters in respect of which they will be likely
to give evidence is, subject
to the <i>de minimus</i> rule", not only contempt
(<i>ibid</i>) but also within the power of the Coroner's Court to prohibit.
The mere fact that a prospective or potential witness has made a statement
outside the Coroner's Court and not to police or other persons officially
connected with the investigation but, say to a reporter,
might well not exclude
a conviction for contempt, not only of the putative witness but also by the
publishing press, if it were published,
for the reasons discussed in <i>Civil
Aviation Authority v ABC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2039%20NSWLR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 39 NSWLR 540</a> at 551 by Kirby P.  
<P>

12   	The plaintiff relies upon the circumstance that, as the
Coroner himself said on 22 October 1998, the inquest into the death
of Caroline
Theresa Byrne had concluded on 11 February of that year with an open finding.
He declared that he was reopening that
inquest.  
<P>

13   	As I have already noted,  the changes brought about by the
1960 Act had the effect of removing the investigation of crime
from the
functions of the coroner insofar as that might have been an object of the
conduct of an inquest.  Thus, if the earlier inquest
had been concluded, the
mere existence of a continuing investigation by police, whether or not the
Coroner was kept informed of its
progress or even recommended its continuance
or direction, could not confer a jurisdiction to make order under ss 44(1) or
(6).
<P>

14   	However, I am far from convinced that the inquest was
concluded in any sense affecting the jurisdiction of the Coroner in
respect of
Ms Byrne's death.  The statutory function of the inquest in this case is to
arrive at findings, if possible, as to the
deceased's identity, the date and
place of that person's death and, except as provided by s 19 relating to
indictable offences, the
manner and cause of the person's death :  s 22(1) of
the Act.  Here, the Coroner made findings as to the identity of the deceased
and the date, place and cause of her death, but not as to its manner.  If it is
relevant to determining the matter in issue, I consider
that what occurred on
22 October 1998 was that the Coroner was not conducting a fresh inquest;
rather, he was reconvening or resuming
the inquest, the hearings of which had
been concluded on 11 February 1998.  Although it might have well been the case
that the inquest,
considered as a hearing, had concluded, I am of the view that
the Coroner's jurisdiction with respect to Ms Bryrne's death had not
been
exhausted since he had not been in a position to make a finding as to the
manner of her death.  It is trite that an inquest
is not a litigation in the
sense that it gives rise to any <i>res judicata</i> and I think, having regard
to the undetermined issue, the Coroner was not <i>functus officio.</i>  
<P>

15   	In <i>R v White</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1860/864.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1860] EngR 864</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281860%29%20121%20ER%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1860) 121 ER 394</a>, the question was
whether the coroner who had held an inquest in which the jury returned a
verdict of "died by the visitation of
God" could hold a second inquest before a
fresh jury to consider new evidence.  The Chief Justice, Lord Cockburn, with
whom the other
members of the Court concurred, said that a coroner cannot hold
a second inquest while the first is existing, pointing out that if
the coroner
were allowed to do so, inconvenience might arise from the inconsistent finding
of the respective juries.  His Lordship
said that, in holding an inquest, "the
coroner performs a judicial duty, and he is <i>functus officio</i> as soon as
the verdict has been returned" (121 ER at 397).  I consider that this
conclusion applies to inquests held under the present
legislation in this
State.  However, as I have pointed out, there was no finding as to the manner
of Ms Bryne's death and I cannot
see, therefore, how the Coroner could be
<i>functus officio</i> in that respect.  I referred earlier in this judgment to
the language used by the Coroner at the conclusion of the hearing on 11
February 1998.  Whether the inquest was then concluded is to be determined by
reference to the statutory functions the Coroner was
exercising.  To my mind,
his use of the term "open finding" and his reference to the continuing
investigations in which "the Coroner
is still very interested", establish that
the inquest had not itself concluded, for all that the evidence then available
had been
adduced and no more hearings were immediately proposed.  That this was
the intention of the Coroner is made clear by his language
(which I have quoted
above) when re-opening the inquest.  The statement on this occasion that "[the]
inquest was concluded on 11
February" does not, when read in context, qualify
this conclusion.  At all events the issue is determined by substance, not
merely
form and the most material consideration is that a substantial
outstanding issue required a finding that had not been made (cf <i>Hoban v
Davey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%201%20NSWLR%2059" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 1 NSWLR 59</a> per Asprey JA at 68-9;  <i>NSW Insurance</i>

the notion of "<i>functus officio</i>" that the relevant function or office has
been discharged or performed "the purpose for which its creation has been
fulfilled" (<i>Leung v Minister for Immigration</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/1313.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 1313</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2079%20FCR%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 79 FCR 400</a> per

Affairs &amp; anor</i>, unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Goldberg J 25

<P>

16   	Even if, under the common law, the Coroner was <i>functus
officio, </i>his jurisdiction was continued or, at least, subject to resumption
by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</i> 1987</a>.
<P>

17   	Whether the Coroner was reopening or resuming the conduct
of the inquest, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13</a> still applied.  Even if the inquest had been relevantly
concluded by the open finding, providing the prerequisites of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(1)</a> were
satisfied, I consider that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> gave jurisdiction to conduct a fresh inquest
into Ms Byrne's death.  In my view, the jurisdiction conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> is not
limited to the circumstances specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 23(1)(a)</a> and (b).  Those events
are mentioned simply to make it clear that the jurisdiction to hold a fresh
inquest is unqualified, which
reading interprets the word "notwithstanding" in
the opening general words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23(1)</a> in its primary sense of "without regard to
or prevention by, not the less for" (see <i>The Australian Concise</i>
<i>Oxford Dictionary</i>, Oxford University Press, (1987) or, more shortly, as
"even where".  Accordingly, the Coroner was, at the time that he made the
non-publication
order holding an inquest, the hearing of which commenced on
that day and for the safeguarding of which he made the order.  I am satisfied
that he convened a hearing on that day either reopening or resuming a hearing
in the inquest previously commenced and not yet completed
or in a fresh inquest
no less because he intended to make the non-publication order so that the
continuation of the inquest would
be safeguarded.  The fact, if it be the fact,
that the Coroner convened the <i>hearing</i> solely to enable the order to be
made under s 44(5) of the Act does not, to my mind, mean that he held or
commenced to <i>hold an inquest</i> for that reason.  I think that the
conclusion that the Coroner was holding the inquest (whether it was continuing
or was fresh under
s 23 of the Act) for the purpose of further inquiring into
the death of Ms Byrne is the proper one on the whole of the evidence and
is to
be distinguished from the reason that led him to convene the hearing on 22
October 1998 which, plainly enough, was instigated
by the impending publication
of material which the Coroner considered should, in the public interest, not be
published.  The Coroner
referred in his reasons to the continuing nature of the
inquiry and regarded the investigation as being carried out on his behalf,
that
is to say, for the purpose of the exercise by the Coroner's Court of its
jurisdiction and indicated that in due course further
hearings would be
convened.  For the reasons that I have already given, the investigation was
only partly conducted on the Coroner's
behalf, the police having an independent
responsibility to investigate crimes and bring offenders to justice but I do
not regard
this as significant.  It appears, I note, that the requirements of s
17 of the Act with regard to giving notice to interested persons
and relatives
was not complied with but, in terms, those requirements relate to the time and
place for the commencement of the inquest
although may be implicit that any
further hearings must be the subject of appropriate notice, by necessary
implication.  Here, however,
the nature of the hearing was not such as to
permit intervention by any relevant person and, even if notice were required,
the failure
to give it did not, to my mind, adversely affect the propriety of
the hearing in the circumstances of this case.  However, I have
not formed a
concluded view as to this matter, this question not having been argued.
<P>

18   	I conclude, therefore, that the Coroner was holding an
inquest within the meaning of s 44(5) of the Act, it is not established
that
the holding of the inquest was for a purpose other than that for which the
jurisdiction was given by the Act, and there was
a sufficient basis for his
exercising his discretion to make the non-publication order complained of in
the public interest.
<P>

19   	Accordingly, the summons must be dismissed with costs.
