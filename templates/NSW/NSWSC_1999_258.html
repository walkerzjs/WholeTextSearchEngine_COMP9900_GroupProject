<b>1746/99		GEORGE THOMAS SHAW v OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

1	It is noted that the plaintiff does not appear although called outside the
Court.  The plaintiff was present in Court yesterday
when the matter was
adjourned to today.  The plaintiff yesterday was represented by his son, Mr
Thomas Shaw, by leave of the Court,
and with the consent of both defendants.  A
further adjournment was sought on the plaintiff's behalf and refused.  Mr
Thomas Shaw
then said he would take no further part in the proceedings and
that, "We are not going to put any arguments and not going to fight
this case".
Although they did not participate further in the proceedings yesterday, he and
his father continued to be present in
Court and were present when the matter
was stood over until today.  Mr George Shaw did not appear when called outside
the Court this
morning.  Mr Thomas Shaw has been present in Court this morning
during the hearing of these proceedings, but has not sought to participate
and
has not participated in them.
<P>

2	The defendants ask for judgment.  I think the appropriate order is that there
be judgment for the defendants on the plaintiff's
claim:  see SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p34" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 34</a> r 5 and
cases collected at [34.5.3] in Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure.  Mr White,
solicitor for the first defendant, asks for
the Official Trustee's costs on an
indemnity basis.  This is on the basis that the present caveat is in identical
form to another
caveat which the Court earlier found baseless.  I understand
the strength of his claim but I think it better in the circumstances
not to
accede to it.  However, both defendants should have their costs of the
proceedings on the ordinary basis.  The orders of the
Court will be:  Judgment
for the defendants on the plaintiff's claim.  I order the plaintiff to pay the
defendants' costs of the
proceedings.
