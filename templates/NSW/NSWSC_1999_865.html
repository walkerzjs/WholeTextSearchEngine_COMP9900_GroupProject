COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<u>12881/1998</u>	<u>YVETTE MICHELLE RYAN (nee Morgan) v RAYMOND LAURENCE
WHITTEN</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The defendant is a solicitor.  He was instructed to act on behalf
of the plaintiff in her professional negligence action against
the Liverpool
Hospital.  Previously, she had been represented by other solicitors.  A Costs
Agreement was made on 17 January 1995.
<P>

2  	An offer to settle the action was made.  On 19 May 1997, there
was a conference in which the offer was discussed.  Both the
plaintiff and her
husband attended the conference.  Instructions were given to accept the offer.
A Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
(for the period 10 November 1994 to 14
May 1997) in the sum of $182,283.55 was given to the plaintiff.  One of the
items appearing
in the memorandum was an estimate to complete the matter in the
sum of $12,500.
<P>

3  	The compromise was implemented and the net moneys payable
pursuant to the settlement ($804,494.40) was received.  These moneys
were paid
into the defendant's trust account.
<P>

4  	In July 1997, the defendant paid certain disbursements from the
trust moneys.  He gave the plaintiff a Memorandum of Costs and
Disbursements
dated 11 July 1997 (for the period up to 30 June 1997) in the sum of
$186,339.73.  The plaintiff signed an authority
which she returned to the
defendant.  She was paid a sum of $618,154.67 from the trust moneys.  The sum
of $96,679.72 was also paid
out of the trust moneys for the defendant's
professional costs.
<P>

5  	Subsequently, certain small sums were paid in respect of
professional costs and disbursements from moneys retained in trust.
<P>

6  	A costs consultant was instructed to prepare a Party/Party Bill
of Costs.  There was some delay in the preparation of that bill.
 It appears
that at least part of the delay was due to difficulty had in obtaining files
from the other solicitors who had previously
acted for  the plaintiff in
respect of her action.  A bill was ultimately prepared.  It was in the order of
$170,000.  It was submitted
to the defendant in the professional negligence
proceedings.  An offer was made to pay costs in the sum of $110,000.  The offer
was
rejected.  An application was made to this Court for assessment of the
bill.
<P>

7  	On 16 June 1998, the plaintiff terminated the defendant's
retainer.  She engaged Mr Cassin as her solicitor.  He sought advice
from
another costs consultant concerning the party/party costs.  The assessment
proceedings were settled on the basis that costs
in the sum of $120,000 would
be accepted and the assessment costs would be split between the parties.
<P>

8  	The question of an assessment of the defendant's solicitor and
client costs was raised in October 1998.  The defendant objected
to any
assessment on the basis that the plaintiff was now out of time to make
application to the court.  Proceedings were brought
in this Court by Summons
filed on 25 November 1998. This process brings the present dispute before the
court.  The assessment stands
in abeyance pending the determination of that
dispute.
<P>

9  	The dispute came on for hearing on 12 August 1999.  The plaintiff
seeks a declaration and order (see paragraphs 1 and 2 of the
Summons).  A
number of affidavits and certain exhibits have been placed before the court.
There are affidavits from both the plaintiff
and her husband.  There is an
affidavit from Mr Cassin.  There is an affidavit from a costs consultant (Paula
Grace Homersham). 
The defendant has sworn an affidavit.  His affidavit is
supported by an affidavit sworn by a former employee (Mr Higginbottom).
<P>

10  	Save for Mr Cassin, all the deponents have been cross-examined.
There is conflict between what has been said on one hand by
the plaintiff and
her husband and on the other hand by the defendant and Mr Higginbottom.
Largely, the conflict relates to what happened
at the conference held on 19 May
1997.  One particular matter in dispute was whether or not the defendant had
given to the plaintiff
a computer print-out relating to his costs up to that
time.
<P>

11  	I have closely observed the demeanour of the witnesses during
the giving of evidence.  In assessing credibility I have had
regard both to
evidence and demeanour.
<P>

12  	It seems to me that this case can be dealt with without
determining questions of credibility.  However, for the assistance
of the
parties, I will express my views on that matter.  Where there is conflict, I
prefer the evidence given by the defendant and
Mr Higginbottom to that given by
the plaintiff and her husband.  In particular  I prefer the evidence of the
defendant and Mr Higginbottom
on the issue of whether or not a computer
printer-out was given to the plaintiff.
<P>

13  	The <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act) together with the
<u>Legal Profession Regulation</u> 1994 (the Regulation) saw the replacement of
the old taxation system by a regime of assessment.  A new scheme was enacted
for the
dealing with disputes as to costs.  One aspect of the scheme entitled a
client to apply for an assessment of costs, even if payment
had been made in
respect of those costs, so long as the application was brought within the
prescribed time limit.
<P>

14  	For present purposes the relevant provisions of the new scheme
are s 199 and reg 25.
<P>

15  	Section 199 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"(1)  A client who is given a bill of costs may apply to the proper officer of
the Supreme Court for an assessment of the whole
of, or any part of, those
costs.
<P>

(2)  An application relating to a bill of costs may be made even if the costs
have been wholly or partly paid.  If the costs have
been wholly or partly paid,
the application is to be made within the period prescribed by the regulations
for the purposes of this
subsection.
<P>

(3)  If any costs have been paid without a bill of costs, the client may
nevertheless apply for an assessment.  For that purpose
the request for payment
by the barrister or solicitor is taken to be the bill of costs.
<P>

(4)  In this section, `client' includes any person who is a party to a costs
agreement relating to legal services for which the
bill of costs is given,
other than the barrister or solicitor who gave the bill or who provided the
services."
<P>

16  	Regulation 25 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"Limitation period for applications by clients for cost 
<P>

assessment where bill paid or part paid
<P>

For the purposes of section 199 (2) of the Act, the prescribed period for
making an application for an assessment of a bill of costs
is the period of 12
months after the bill was given to the client."
<P>

17  	Section 199 has been looked at by the court in a number of
cases.  The cases have seen the expression of some conflicting views.
 The
plaintiff places reliance on <u>Selosse v Whitten</u> (Graham AJ, unreported 26
August 1997).  This is one of the decisions (to the extent that it may be seen
as laying down any relevant
matter of principle) which stands in conflict with
other authority.
<P>

18  	The question of the construction of s 199 arose for
consideration in <u>Hook v Simpsons Solicitors</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/667.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 667.</a>  In that
case, I made the following observations:-
<P>

"Section 199 prescribes the circumstances in which an application for
assessment of costs by a client may be made.  Subsection (1)
enables a client
to apply to the Court for an assessment of costs where the client has been
given a bill of costs.  Subsection (2)
enables an `application relating to a
bill of costs' to be made even if the costs have been wholly or partly paid,
but the application
has to be made within the prescribed period (a period of 12
months after the bill was given).  In cases where there has been payment
without a bill of costs, the section provides that the client may nevertheless
apply for an assessment.  In those circumstances,
the request for payment is
taken to be the bill of costs (subsection 3).
<P>

The intention of the legislature was to impose a prescribed period for the
making of an application in those cases where payment
has been made.  If the
payment has been made prior to the giving of a bill the prescribed period runs
from any request for payment."
<P>

19  	In this case, whilst there is dispute between the parties as to
whether or not the defendant had given a Bill of Costs at the
relevant time, it
seems to me that this is a question that does not need to be resolved.
<P>

20  	Despite the dispute as to various matters, certain matters of
fact are not in dispute.  There is no dispute that the defendant
has made
requests for payment of costs.  There are requests that had been made at least
by July 1997.  There is no dispute that the
defendant was authorised by the
plaintiff to apply part of the trust moneys towards the payment of those costs.
There is no dispute
that payment has been made in respect of those costs.  In
these circumstances, the statutory scheme makes it abundantly clear that
the
time limit for making application for an assessment of those costs had expired
by the time of the filing of the Summons on 25
November 1998 (whether or not it
can be so characterised, the parties have proceeded on the assumption that the
Summons makes an
application for assessment).  Accordingly, the court does not
have jurisdiction to entertain the application for their assessment.
<P>

21  	There is a further problem that confronts the plaintiff.  It
arises by reason of the provisions of s 208C.  This section provides
that a
costs assessor is to decline to assess a Bill of Costs if the requirements of
subsection (1) are satisfied.  Subsection (3)
provides that the section does
not apply to any provisional costs agreement that the costs assessor determines
to be unjust under
s 208D.
<P>

22  	In this case, the plaintiff contends that the Costs Agreement
was unjust.  For present purposes, she relies on the evidence
of the costs
consultant.  Unless she was successful on that question, any costs assessor
appointed by the court would be obliged
to decline to assess the costs.  In the
light of what has been earlier said, it is not necessary to further pursue this
question.
 In any event, it is a decision that is required to be made by the
appointed costs assessor.
<P>

23  	The plaintiff also contends that the court has an inherent power
to order a solicitor to deliver an assessable Bill of Costs.
 Questions
relating to this matter were not fully argued before me.  As I have said,
conflicting views have been expressed in relation
to the matter of the exercise
of inherent jurisdiction.  The balance of authority does not favour the view
that there is relevant
inherent jurisdiction.  In the light of the new
statutory scheme with its imposition of time limitations, I am not satisfied
that
the court does have such an inherent power to order an assessment out of
time.  However, if a different view were to be taken of
the matter, I do not
consider that the evidence discloses a state of affairs in which the court
would be disposed to exercise such
a power in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

24  	I refuse the relief sought in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Summons.
The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the Summons to date.
 The exhibits may be
returned.
