MONDAY 15 MARCH 1999
<P>

<center><b>RICHARD FRANCIS GORMAN v. UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	In these proceedings, the plaintiff, who appears in person, by an amended
summons seeks orders that the first, second, third and
fourth defendants
instruct various faculties of those universities "to cogitate and teach, either
as dogma or as controversy, the
principles and practice of health care which
have been potentially exposed by the discovery that vision improves, in
appropriate
patients, when the spine is manipulated";  that the fifth, sixth
and seventh defendants act to ensure that the discussion and dissemination
of
what is said to be medical information to that effect is fair, unbiased,
unrestricted,  appropriately comprehensive, appropriately
promulgated and
primarily directed to the benefit of the community, and that the defendants
supply the plaintiff with appropriately
competent and expert health care
professionals to facilitate his continuing treatment by spinal manipulation
according to those principles.
 An order is also sought that the defendants act
to address any ignorance of health care professionals on the matter to relieve
the
plaintiff of undue stress in regard to his concern for the health of his
patients.
<P>

2	The defendants seek that the action be dismissed under Part 13 Rule 5 of the
Rules.
<P>

3	The plaintiff has filed in support of the amended summons, two affidavits of
his own and in addition an affidavit by Mr. Bilton.
 They have been read on the
application.
<P>

4	I have been provided with a website extract concerning the Charter of the
University of Sydney, one of the defendants, and on
behalf of the defendants,
Mr. Craddock of counsel who appears for them, has provided me with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uona1989285/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uona1989285/" class="autolink_findacts">University of Newcastle Act 1989</a> as a specimen of the legislation which he
indicates is applicable generally amongst the university defendants concerning
their role
and function.
<P>

5	I have enquired of the parties as to whether, on the question of standing,
the application was brought for relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.65</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.
Mr. Craddock indicated that his real point was that, whether, under that
section or otherwise, the action had no possible substance
whatsoever, even if
Dr. Gorman might add what he wished to the evidence he had already filed.
<P>

6	I enquired of Dr. Gorman as to what additional evidence he might wish to
provide.  He indicated that he wished to provide evidence
of rejection by the
Minister and the universities of the proposed evidence of the seriousness of
his own condition for which spinal
manipulation might be of assistance;  that
tunnel vision was a condition of seriousness from which he suffered and which
could be
relieved by the treatment;  that he had been defamed by a
representative of the University of New South Wales in a television programme;
that certain evidence could be given on his part, that the Medical Tribunal
could have reviewed a condition attached to his registration
which was of long
standing;  that evidence going to, essentially, a refusal on the part of the
Professor of Ophthalmology to countenance
the teaching of the treatment at
university, all could be put on.
<P>

7	I have reviewed all the material in the affidavits and take into account the
evidence that might be put on, in accordance with
what Dr. Gorman has said,.  I
have considered whether the plaintiff may have a special interest or not and
whether he might have
such an interest that might appropriately base relief
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.65.</a>  These were not proceedings by way of cross-action in some
proceedings in which the plaintiff is being sued and wishes to seek indemnity
or contribution, these are proceedings in which the plaintiff appears to be
seeking declarations at least to the general effect or
within the broad ambit
of the orders as sought in the amended summons.  He is unable to point to any
legal duty whatsoever binding
upon the named defendants particularly owed to
him or in which he would have a particular interest in the sense known to the
law
or any principle of the law which would require the defendants to act in
accordance with his wishes.  Neither the evidence already
on nor that which he
indicates might be capable of being put on, in any way discloses some such
cause of action, considering the
material at its highest, that might dispose
the court to grant him the orders sought, even if the discretion to grant a
declaration
might be exercised in his favour.
<P>

8	He does not seem to have standing.  He does not seem to have a particular
entitlement.  There is some evidence to suggest that
he might have the medical
condition such that he might have a particular and personal basis for complaint
about the unavailability
generally of a treatment that he himself prefers.
This is a different thing from that necessary to found a legal basis to require
others to espouse a particular teaching and to disseminate that treatment.
<P>

9	I am unable to find any reasonable cause of action.  In my view the
maintenance of the action is, in that sense, frivolous and
vexatious and an
abuse.  I dismiss the action.
<P>

10	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>
