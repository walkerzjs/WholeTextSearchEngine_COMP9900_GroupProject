MONDAY 5 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>10632/1999</u>	<u>JO-ANNE HOOK v SIMPSONS SOLICITORS</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 18 March
1999.  In substance, the process brings an appeal pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).
<P>

2  	The appeal was heard on 8 June 1999.  An abundance of material
was placed before the Court (including many exhibits).
<P>

3  	The defendant is a firm of solicitors.  The plaintiff is a
resident of Queensland.  In April 1994, she retained the defendant
to act on
her behalf in Federal Court proceedings in the State of Victoria.
<P>

4  	Between May 1994 and 29 August 1997, the defendant sent what have
been described as invoices for professional fees.  The invoices
were rendered
at regular intervals.  They were periodically paid (at least in part) by the
plaintiff.
<P>

5  	By 2 September 1997, the plaintiff had retained Messrs Baker
Johnson to act on her behalf in respect of the proceedings.  At
that time,
invoices for costs and disbursements had been rendered in the total sum of
$64,096.75.  All but $5,000.00 of the total
sum had been paid.  There had been
no dispute as to the costs and disbursements rendered by the defendant.
<P>

6  	The proceedings in the Federal Court were settled in September
1997.  On 6 October 1997, Messrs. Baker Johnson requested an
itemised bill of
costs in taxable form from the defendant.  On 17 October 1997, the defendant
responded with inter alia a document
entitled "Memorandum of Costs in Taxable
Form".  It was dated 20 October 1997.  It was in the sum of $55,857.00.  This
sum comprised
professional costs.  The document did not include any amount for
disbursements.
<P>

7  	On 9 April 1998, the balance owing was paid on the basis that the
plaintiff was then insisting upon an entitlement to have an
itemised bill in
taxable form.
<P>

8  	On 8 May 1998, the defendant responded by advising that an
itemised bill in taxable form had already been given and purported
to supply
another copy of the bill.  This document was entitled "Memorandum of Costs in
Taxable Form" but was dated 30 April 1998
and was in the sum of $64,096.75.
This sum comprised $55,857.00 for professional costs and $8,239.75 for
disbursements.
<P>

9  	Save for the different date and inclusion of the sum for
disbursements, the October 1997 document and the April 1998 document
were
similar.
<P>

10  	On 9 September 1998, the plaintiff applied to this Court for an
assessment of the bill of costs dated 30 April 1998.  The application
was
referred to a Costs Assessor (Mr Hattersley).  The plaintiff provided a Notice
of Objection to this document (it extended to
72 pages).  The defendant made a
response to the objections.  The response raised inter alia a matter of the
competency of the application.
 The Costs Assessor sought submissions from the
plaintiff on this matter.  Messrs Baker Johnson responded with the contention
that
the relevant period for the bringing of the application did not expire
until 17 October 1998.
<P>

11  	On 12 February 1999, the Costs Assessor made a decision in the
application.  He decided that he had "No authority or jurisdiction
to proceed
with the assessment".  This decision was founded on provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s199.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 199</a> (2) of
the Act and Regulation 25 of the Legal Profession Regulation 1994 (the
Regulation).
<P>

12  	Section 208L provides a narrow avenue of appeal.  It is
restricted to a matter of law arising in the assessment proceedings.
 The
appellant bears the onus of satisfying the Court that there is an entitlement
to relief.
<P>

13  	The plaintiff's case is founded on two submissions.  Firstly, it
is contended that the Costs Assessor misconceived or misapplied
the relevant
provisions.  The case is that there was no time bar as the Costs Assessor was
being asked to assess the bill dated 30
April 1998.  Secondly, by way of
alternative submission, it is said that the doctrine of election (or perhaps
estoppel) precludes
any reliance on the time bar.
<P>

14  	It is common ground that the relevant provisions are s 199 and
regulation 25.  Section 199 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"(1)  A client who is given a bill of costs may apply to the proper officer of
the Supreme Court for an assessment of the whole
of, or any part of, those
costs.
<P>

(2)  An application relating to a bill of costs may be made even if the costs
have been wholly or partly paid.  If the costs have
been wholly or partly paid,
the application is to be made within the period prescribed by the regulations
for the purposes of this
subsection.
<P>

(3)  If any costs have been paid without a bill of costs, the client may
nevertheless apply for an assessment.  For that purpose
the request for payment
by the barrister or solicitor is taken to be the bill of costs.
<P>

(4)  In this section, `client' includes any person who is a party to a costs
agreement relating to legal services for which the
bill of costs is given,
other than the barrister or solicitor who gave the bill or who provided the
services."
<P>

15  	Regulation 25 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"Limitation period for applications by clients for cost assessment where bill
paid or part paid
<P>

For the purposes of section 199 (2) of the Act, the prescribed period for
making an application for an assessment of a bill of costs
is the period of 12
months after the bill was given to the client."
<P>

16  	Reference was also made to the unhelpful definition of "bill of
costs" which may be found in s 173.  The section defines it
to mean a bill of
costs for providing legal services and includes a memorandum of fees.  Further,
reference was made to regulation
22A.  It provides the particulars which are to
be included in a bill of costs for the purposes of s 193 (1).  Section 193 is
headed
"Form of bill of costs".  It enables regulations to be made making
provision for or with respect to the form of and the particulars
to be included
in bills of costs.
<P>

17  	There are some differences between the earlier invoices and the
subsequent memoranda.  The memoranda provides additional information
concerning
the person involved in the supply of the legal services.  The memoranda provide
a dollar sum for each item as opposed
to an identification of units (as shown
in the invoices).
<P>

18  	Whilst, the plaintiff contends that none of the documentation
satisfies the requirements of regulation 22A, she further contends
that this
failure is not of significance.
<P>

19  	Section 199 prescribes the circumstances in which an application
for assessment of costs by a client may be made.  Subsection
(1) enables a
client to apply to the Court for an assessment of costs where the client has
been given a bill of costs.  Subsection
(2) enables an "application relating to
a bill of costs" to be made even if the costs have been wholly or partly paid,
but the application
has to be made within the prescribed period (a period of 12
months after the bill was given).  In cases where there has been payment
without a bill of costs, the section provides that the client may nevertheless
apply for an assessment.  In those circumstances,
the request for payment is
taken to be the bill of costs (subsection 3).
<P>

20  	The intention of the legislature was to impose a prescribed
period for the making of an application in those cases where payment
has been
made.  If the payment has been made prior to the giving of a bill the
prescribed period runs from any request for payment.
<P>

21  	This is a case where payment has been made in respect of the
costs.  Accordingly the application has to have been brought within
the
prescribed period.  Payment was made following receipt of invoices sent prior
to September 1997.  The invoices gave rise to a
request for payment in the
sense contemplated by the section.  It is the plaintiff's case that the
invoices cannot be said to constitute
a bill of costs.  In my view, that
contention is correct.  In these circumstances, the prescribed period had
expired prior to 9 September
1998.
<P>

22  	In this case, it would not seem to matter whether the memoranda
(or either of them) can be seen as a bill of costs in the relevant
sense.  In
the event that it may be of significance, I express the view that both
memoranda given in this case fall short of satisfying
the requirements of
regulation 22A.
<P>

23  	The election (or perhaps estoppel) argument was but briefly
pursued and without great enthusiasm.  It had not been agitated
before the
Costs Assessor.  Even if it had been of substance, in the circumstances of this
case, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff
has an entitlement to advance the
argument in this appeal.  In any event, I am not satisfied that it is of
substance.
<P>

24  	Accordingly I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has
demonstrated an error of law which would justify the disturbing of the
decision
of the Costs Assessor.  I am not satisfied that the plaintiff was entitled to
apply to the Court for an assessment of the
costs.
<P>

25  	The Summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of
the Summons.  The exhibits may be returned.
