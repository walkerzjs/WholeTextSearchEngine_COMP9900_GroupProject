<P>

<i>Friday, 7 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4906/98	ELCORP CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED   -v-   LYMORE PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   By summons filed on 4 December 1998 the
plaintiff Elcorp Constructions Pty Ltd seeks an order that the statutory demand
dated 19
November 1998, served upon it by the defendant, Lymore Pty Ltd, be set
aside pursuant to section 459 G of the<i> Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2   	That statutory demand seeks payment by the plaintiff to the
defendant of the amount of $20,250. That amount is described in
the schedule to
the demand as follows: "Amount due by Elcorp Construction Pty Ltd on accounts
relative to construction and building
work from 22 May 1998 to 25 June
1998".
<P>

3   	The plaintiff is a builder.  The plaintiff was involved in
construction of a block of home units at Spencer Street Rose Bay
in 1998. The
plaintiff required building work in relation to formwork and concreting to be
performed on the construction site.  The
plaintiff negotiated with the
defendant, with a view to the defendant performing as a subcontractor to the
plaintiff that formwork
and concreting work.
<P>

4   	The only affidavit evidence placed before the Court is that
of John Paul Elcham, a director for the plaintiff company.  He
sets forth
details of various conversations which he had with a Mr Neville Hewitt the
engineer in the employ of the defendant, who
was apparently responsible for the
defendant's work in relation to the proposed arrangement between the plaintiff
and the defendant.
<P>

5   	It is unnecessary for me to set forth in detail the
evidence in that affidavit concerning the various conversations between
Mr
Elcham and Mr Hewitt and subsequently between Mr Elcham and Mr Raymond Bamausa,
the managing director of the defendant.
<P>

6   	Suffice it to say, however, that the defendant company
performed work in relation to the footings at the construction site,
but did
not perform the concreting work which was also the subject of the
discussions.
<P>

7   	The amount which is claimed in the statutory demand,
$20,250, appears to relate only to formwork.  I would herein interpolate
that
neither party has placed in evidence the accounts upon which the demand is
based, but the plaintiff does not dispute that those
accounts relate to
formwork.
<P>

8   	There is no suggestion that the plaintiff disputes that the
work to which those accounts relate was performed; neither does
the plaintiff
suggest that the amounts claimed in those accounts are excessive for that
work.
<P>

9   	The plaintiff, however, seek to have the statutory demand
set aside upon the ground set forth in subsection (1) of section
459 H, in that
the plaintiff, so it submits, has an offsetting claim.
<P>

10   	The defendant points to the fact that the conversations
which are set forth in Mr Elcham's affidavit between both himself
and Mr Hewitt
and himself and Mr Bamausa clearly contemplate that there would eventually be a
written agreement between the parties
concerning the amount to be paid by the
plaintiff to the defendant for the proposed building work to be performed by
the defendant
and that, in the absence of any such written agreement, no
binding agreement came into existence between the parties.
<P>

11   	The defendant, in that regard, relies upon the classic
decision of the High Court of Australia in<b> </b><i>Masters v Cameron
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 353</a>, in particular the joint judgment of Dixon CJ and
McTiernan and Kitto JJ at 360 to 362.
<P>

12   	The defendant further submits that the work which the
defendant performed in relation to footings was quite separate work
from that
which was envisaged might eventually be performed if a binding contract came
into existence between the parties in relation
to concreting.
<P>

13   	Therefore, so it is submitted by the defendant, there can
be no offsetting claim of the nature asserted by the plaintiff,
since that
offsetting claim relates to work which was not done by the defendant but work
which, so the defendant submits, it was
not in any way obligated to perform
since there was no binding agreement between the parties in that regard.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff, however, submits that what was contemplated
by the parties was that there should be a contract in respect to
the entire
work, both formwork and concreting. Further, that, whilst there was no
concluded agreement concerning the final price
--- indeed there was an original
quotation, and there was a revised quotation --- the parties (who were $20,000
apart in respect
of the revised quotation) agreed that the defendant should
commence work, in the hope apparently that the parties would be able to
reach
agreement on a price somewhere between the amount of the revised quotation and
the highest amount which the plaintiff was prepared
to pay before the work was
completed.
<P>

15   	In proceedings of the nature of that presently before the
Court, it is not appropriate for me to attempt to resolve the question
of
whether the plaintiff will ultimately succeed in its assertion of an offsetting
claim.  It is necessary only that I should be
satisfied that the plaintiff has
a genuine offsetting claim, one which is not doomed to failure. It certainly
appears from the evidence
in Mr Elcham's affidavit that it can genuinely be
argued on the part of the plaintiff that there was an agreement between the
parties
that the defendant would perform the entirety of the work, even though
at the time when the defendant started to perform part of
that (work the
formwork) there was no agreement as to the price for the entirety of the
work.
<P>

16   	I do not express any view as to whether the plaintiff will
ultimately succeed in establishing an offsetting claim based upon
such an
agreement as to the entirety of the work. But it is certainly a claim which I
consider the plaintiff is entitled to have
litigated before an appropriate
tribunal.
<P>

17   	I consider, therefore, that the plaintiff does have an
offsetting claim.  The amount of the offsetting claim is certainly
considerably
in excess of the amount set forth in the statutory demand. It is appropriate,
therefore, that in those circumstances
I should order that the demand be set
aside, which I propose so to do.
<P>

18   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1).	I order that the statutory demand dated 19 November 1998 served by the
defendant upon the plaintiff be set aside.
<P>

(2).	I order that the defendant pay the costs of plaintiff.
<P>

The exhibits, other than exhibit A, may be returned.
