<P>

<b><u>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT - On admissibility of evidence; see
p1143</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  It is appropriate that I give a ruling on two
aspects that have arisen from Mr Hawker's evidence, which have been amplified
by
evidence which he has given, by consent of all parties on the voir dire.
<P>

2  	The problem which arises at the moment flows from the pleas of
justification put on by the defendants, some time ago.  Very
broadly stated, a
critical issue in this case is whether certain charges which the plaintiff
company rendered to clients, including
government departments, were
unreasonable.
<P>

3  	A vast amount of evidence has been put before the Court on the
issue of justification and reasonableness.  It is fair to say
that the parties
have been careful, if not anxious, to confine that evidence, so far as
reasonably possible, to 1992 and 1993.  One
matter that has attracted a great
deal of cross-examination, and some affirmative evidence, is what is involved
in the various processes
which have been itemised on invoices rendered by the
plaintiff company to various clients.  These matters have been the subject of
intensive cross-examination and debate during the course of the hearing thus
far.  There has been video evidence tendered by the
defendants, without
objection, in relation to certain translation and typesetting processes which
goes to the issue of the reasonableness
of the amount of time involved in the
various processes, the subject of the invoices.  However, yesterday the case
took a somewhat
dramatic turn, although perhaps that is an overstatement, in
this respect.
<P>

4  	Evidence was led from Mr Hawker, who is the proprietor, if I can
use that term, of a company only recently set up, which performs
similar types
of functions to the plaintiff company and, as I understand the evidence,
similar, and I am using that term in a general
sense, to functions performed by
the plaintiff company in 1992 and 1993.  The plaintiffs' legal advisers were
unaware that this evidence
was to be led, and a particular objection has been
taken to the fact that the defendants wish to adduce evidence from Mr Hawker as
to 1999 charges by his company in relation to the sort of processes referred to
in the invoices.  Another aspect, which I suppose
could be described as an
anterior aspect, is that objection has been taken to evidence being put before
the jury by Mr Hawker as
to his knowledge of the relevant processes, again
using that term generally, in 1992 and 1993. 
<P>

5  	Having taken evidence on the voir dire, which has been the
subject of evidence-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination,
I have
concluded, within the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</u> 1995</a> that
evidence by Mr Hawker as to his knowledge of what he asserts to be the
processes involved in the descriptions given in the invoices
could rationally
affect, (directly or indirectly), and I stress indirectly, the assessment of
the probability of the existence of
a fact in issue in the proceedings.  One
fact clearly in issue is the time taken in 1992 and 1993 to perform certain, if
not all,
of the relevant processes.  That evidence will be, of course, subject
to cross-examination.
<P>

6  	A point forcefully made by Mr Hughes QC on behalf of the
plaintiffs is that the witness has conceded on the voir dire that he
is not
familiar, and has never been familiar, with the way in which these various
processes are carried out or were carried out within
the plaintiff's
organisation.  That is, however, in my view a matter that could be clearly and
fairly dealt with in cross-examination
and the matter could then be left to the
jury's assessment.  I do not think that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> is relevant on this particular
limb of the objection, because of the nature of the evidence that has already
been given and the availability
of instructions to counsel in relation to these
processes.
<P>

7  	As I understand the evidence, there does not seem to have been a
great variation between the way these processes were conducted,
generally
speaking, within the plaintiff's organisation in 1992 and 1993 and the way in
which they are probably now conducted.  However
I find the question of whether
Mr Hawker can give evidence of the current charges for his organisation in
relation to the subject
work to be difficult.  Mr Littlemore for the defendants
has indicated that he does not intend to seek from Mr Hawker, in evidence,
any
comparison between his company's charges and those of Mr Assaf's company in
1992 and 1993.  What Mr Littlemore seeks to do is
to adduce evidence of the
current charges within Mr Hawker's organisation and invite the jury to
translate those charges back to
the 1992/1993 years and make a comparison on
the basis, I apprehend, that they are so similar, the inference would be
available that
the 1992/1993 charges were unreasonable.
<P>

8  	To me this is basically a question of relevance within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55.</a>  It seems to me that there are so many variables involved in
that exercise that evidence of current charges by Mr Hawker's company
could not
rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of
the existence of the fact in issue, namely,
the reasonableness or otherwise of
the charges by the plaintiff company six or seven years ago.  This would inject
into the jury's
deliberations an element of speculation that would not have
been contemplated by the draftpersons of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55.</a>  It opens up, on the eighteenth
day of the trial, or the seventeenth day of the trial, perhaps to be fairer, a
whole new area of
investigation.  Whether Mr Hughes could or could not get
instructions to deal with it, within the time parameters that jury trials
involve, I leave as an open question.  I have no doubt that that would be an
extraordinarily difficult matter for a number of reasons,
bearing in mind the
diverse factors involved. 
<P>

9  	I do not think that it is necessary to turn to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> to resolve
this second limb of the argument.  In my view it is purely a question of
relevance within the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55.</a> There is insufficient evidence before me to
justify my concluding that the jury could make a rational comparison between
current
charges and 1992/1993 charges.  Accordingly, I will permit the
defendants to lead evidence from Mr Hawker as to his knowledge in
1992 and 1993
of the processes in the invoices as he understands it.  That will, of course,
be the subject of cross-examination,
which no doubt will focus upon his
unfamiliarity with the specific processes conducted within the plaintiff
organisation.  That to
my mind does not render the evidence on that limb
inadmissible.
