<b>3266/99	KELLY CRAWFORD-ELIAS v R &amp; A DEVELOPMENTS PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>His Honour:</b>
<P>

1   	R &amp; A Developments Pty Ltd, the defendant in these
proceedings, is the developer of a home unit development on land at
Rose Bay.
By contract dated 14 April 1999 it sold apartment 9 in that development to the
present plaintiff for the price of $750,000.
 The contract contains a curious
special provision to the effect that, if the contract be completed on time, the
purchase price will
be reduced to $500,000.  There is no evidence before the
Court of the present value of the apartment.  The contract precluded the
plaintiff from having a caveat entered upon the title to the land until the
proposed plan of strata subdivision be registered, ie,
she was precluded from
lodging a caveat which affected the land in globo.  The contract also contains
a provision to the effect that
if, despite the expenditure of due efforts,
registration of the plan of strata subdivision be not effected by 30 September
1999 then
either party may terminate the contract.  That date has not yet been
reached, nor has the plan of subdivision yet been registered.
<P>

2   	At the date of contract the land was, and still is, subject
to a registered first mortgage to Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group
Limited ("the Bank").  After the date of contract, the Bank appointed a Mr Lord
as the receiver and manager of the land exercising
its power under the
mortgage.  That appointment occurred on 10 June 1999.  Correspondence was
entered into between the plaintiff
and the receiver in the course of which Le
Compte Davey, acting as the receiver's solicitors, on 10 July 1999 stated:
<P>

"1	The registered first mortgagee regards the sale price of $750,000.00 as well
below the current market value of the property and
for that reason the
mortgagee is not prepared to release the property from its mortgage.
<P>

 
<P>

2	The alleged sale to your client was not made with the consent of the first
mortgagee nor the Receiver and Manager.
<P>

 
<P>

3	In the circumstances, the Receiver and Manager is unwilling to complete the
alleged Contract for Sale and hereby gives notice
of his repudiation of the
same."
<P>

3   	After further correspondence, the plaintiff's reaction was,
on 21 July 1999, to institute these proceedings seeking specific
performance of
the contract.  That summons was before the Court on 10 August 1999.  On that
day Mr Alex Roth, solicitor, of Le Compte
Davey and Mr Nell, of counsel,
attended at Court on the receiver's instructions.  They negotiated an
adjournment with the plaintiff's
representatives.  When, however, the matter
was called before the Registrar they did not announce an appearance, but
remained at
the back of the Court.  The matter was adjourned by the plaintiff's
representatives in accordance with the agreement.  The defendant's
lawyers'
action in not appearing was explained as arising from the fact that it had not
been decided whether or not an appearance
would be entered on behalf of the
defendant in the proceedings.  Since then, although there has been further
correspondence, it has
been on a number of occasions asserted by Le Compte
Davey that it had been decided by the defendant not to enter an appearance or
participate in the proceedings.  The matter was stood over by me from yesterday
to today.  The defendant was again notified that
the matter was before the
Court today (as it had been in relation to yesterday) and has not appeared.
<P>

4   	It appears to me that none of the grounds assigned in the
letter of 10 July 1999 and set out in [2] was a proper basis for
repudiation of
the contract on the defendant's part. The receiver's consent to the contract
was not needed, as he had not been appointed
as at the date of the contract.
Whatever the situation between the defendant and the Bank as to the necessity
of consent to such
a contract, that, on the evidence in this case, does not
affect the validity of the contract or the rights of the plaintiff.  The
assertion that the sale was at an undervalue cannot justify repudiation.  The
law requires people to carry out, as well as good bargains,
bad bargains,
unless the rules as to unconscionable transactions are breached.  There is an
uncertainty as to whether the Bank will
or will not give such a discharge of
mortgage as would permit the contract to be performed.  I shall say more
concerning the relevance
of that matter a little later in the judgment.  
<P>

5   	In the absence of the defendant, the matter has proceeded
before me as a final hearing upon the summons.  The plaintiff asks
that I make
a declaration that the contract is on foot and that the parties are bound
thereby.  Counsel for the plaintiff has suggested
further orders which ought be
made at this stage by way of limited orders for specific performance.  The
plaintiff has sworn to her
readiness, willingness and ability to carry out the
contract.  One suggestion that has been made is an order requiring the
defendant
to use or continue to use its best endeavours to have the plan of
strata subdivision registered by 30 September 1999.  The difficulty
with this
is that there is no evidence that it is not doing so.  The defendant, whether
acting by its directors or the receiver,
has an obvious motivation to have the
plan of strata subdivision registered.  Furthermore, counsel for the plaintiff
has frankly
and properly stated from the bar table that no material is
available to the plaintiff suggesting that this is not occurring.  It
is
something which the defendant may well be proceeding to do for its own purposes
quite independently of the existence or non existence
of the contract.  Another
suggestion that has been made is that an order ought be made requiring
completion in due course but subject
to the possibility of rescission in the
meantime.  Two difficulties that may be seen in the way of making any order in
the nature
of specific performance are the possibility that the contract may
come to naught through a right of rescission being exercised by
the defendant
after 30 September 1999, or may become impossible of performance by the Bank
refusing to give such a discharge of mortgage
as would permit completion.
Those, however, are both matters for the future, and I do not think that it can
be said at this time
that it is clear that performance of the contract will be
impossible.  Those considerations do not, in my view, preclude appropriate
relief in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

6   	Further, it ought be said that this is not one of those
cases where the plaintiff has selected issues without the presentation
of the
whole picture as at the time the matter comes before the Court, or where the
situation in respect of which relief is sought
by way of declaration can be
said to be hypothetical or the declaration itself advisory in nature:  see

1992) [1924].  This is a case where the defendant has unequivocally repudiated
the contract.  The plaintiff's response is no less unequivocal.  In face of the
repudiation she has elected to treat the contract
as on foot, and brought these
proceedings accordingly.  The subject of the relief that may be given in such
circumstances as the
present is usefully discussed in Dr Spry's work on
Equitable Remedies (5th ed, 1997) 128-129 where the following is stated:
<P>

"But this is not to say that the mere anticipation of possible difficulties
leads to a refusal of relief.  If, on the materials
before the court,
performance may or may not be able to be completed, the various probabilities
will be taken into account in deciding
on the order that is most just in all
the circumstances.  Thus it may be most appropriate to order specific
performance in the ordinary
manner, so that if necessary the defendant may
later approach the court for a modification or variation by reason of
subsequent difficulties
or may rely upon them in any subsequent difficulties or
may rely upon them in any subsequent proceedings in relation to the enforcement
of the order.  Again, if at the time of the original application there is shown
to be a substantial risk that performance will not
be possible, it may be most
appropriate to make a conditional order or else to adjourn the proceedings
until the position becomes
more clear."
<P>

7   	However, the time has not arrived and may not arrive for
completion of this contract and there is no evidence that the  defendant
is not
carrying out, for other purposes, the activity at present most pertinent to the
further performance of the contract, namely,
the achievement of registration of
the strata subdivision plan.  In these circumstances, I do not at the moment
think it appropriate
to make a limited order for specific performance
commanding any particular act on the defendant's part.  I do, however, propose
to
declare not only that the contract is on foot, but that the parties thereto
are bound to carry it out in accordance with its terms,
to make it quite plain
that the Court regards the purported repudiation as ineffective and the
defendant as bound to continue performance
of the contract.  In granting this
limited relief at the present time, the Court envisages that it may be
necessary for the plaintiff
to return to Court if it becomes apparent that due
endeavours are not being made to obtain the registration of the plan of
subdivision
or that other acts necessary to the performance of the contract are
not being duly carried out, so as to place the defendant in breach
of its
obligations.  The declaration that I have outlined will therefore be coupled
with a liberty to the plaintiff to apply, so
that she may return to the Court
for further orders in the present proceedings as the necessity arises, or as
she may be advised.
<P>

8   	I am asked for an order for indemnity costs of the
proceedings to date.  I am of the view that an order for costs on the indemnity
basis is appropriate. The defendant has caused the institution of these
proceedings by a repudiation which appears to be baseless,
and which it has
chosen not to seek to justify before the Court.  It actually sent
representatives to Court to discuss the course
of the proceedings with the
plaintiff's representatives on an earlier occasion, but without instructions to
appear before the Court
on that occasion.  It has given subsequent instructions
to its solicitors not to enter an appearance.  It has declined, or failed,
to
agree with the plaintiff that the contract is still on foot, and to bring the
proceedings by agreement to the end to which they
have now come.  The plaintiff
is clearly entitled to her costs.  It seems to me that the groundless
repudiation and the lack of any
cooperation to save the expenditure of money by
the plaintiff, once the proceedings were brought, are a justification that the
costs
to which the plaintiff is clearly entitled should be on the indemnity
basis.
<P>

9   	The orders that I propose are:
<P>

(1)	I declare that there was and is a binding and enforceable contract between
the plaintiff as purchaser and the defendant as vendor
in terms of the
"Contract for the sale of land - 1996 edition" between the parties dated 14
April 1999 relating to the land in the
schedule hereto and that the parties are
bound to perform and carry the same into effect according to its terms.
<P>

(2)	I grant liberty to the plaintiff to apply on 24 hours' notice.
<P>

(3)	I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings on
the indemnity basis.
