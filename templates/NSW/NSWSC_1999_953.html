<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>(Crown's application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38</a> to cross-examine Mina Park on her statement
of 7 May 1997 - see p.524 of the transcript)</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  In my view notwithstanding the objection, the
application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.78</a> does not preclude the giving of the evidence sought to be
elicited. 
<P>

2  	In cross-examination evidence has been elicited from the witness
as to her beliefs concerning her brother and her knowledge
of her brother from
which she has given evidence of her opinion of her brother's character, at
least in particular respects.  There
has also been elicited from the witness
evidence of her belief that her brother, in the absence of insanity, would not
have killed
his wife and children or, presumably, been party to a killing of
his wife and children (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.78</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s110.html" class="autolink_findacts">110</a>).
<P>

3  	The evidence the Crown now seeks to elicit is of a statement
made, as was pointed out by Mr. Temby in his objection, at an earlier
point of
time to the ascertainment that they were in fact murdered, prior to the finding
of the bodies but after their disappearance.
 That evidence would go to a
number of matters.  Firstly, knowledge on the witness' part that her brother
was lying when he gave
an account that his wife and children had gone to
Brisbane;  secondly, the witness' belief, expressed in the terms, "I am in no
doubt
that he was involved in the disappearance of Susan and the children", and
thirdly, a speculation as to a number of possibilities
as to the way in which
he might have been so involved.
<P>

4  	As to these, it was one possibility that he might have, with his
girlfriend, Demi, taken them far away and threatened that he
and she would do
something to them in order to liquidate the deceased's possessions, to provide
money for he and Demi to go to Korea.
 They did, in fact, the evidence will
show, go to Korea and did seek to obtain her money.
<P>

5  	Another possibility that is raised is that on the way to "dump
them", this being presumably a reference to taking them far away,
the
girlfriend or the accused might have hurt one of the kids or Susan, or one of
them, in the heat of the moment and that Susan
and the kids may be dead or if
any had survived they were too frightened to return to Sydney.
<P>

6  	There were other speculations as to prostitution, that is, that
Susan had been sold off by the accused for the purpose of prostitution
to
compensate for gambling debts and that the accused might have enquired about
putting the children in some charitable institution,
particularly a convent.
<P>

7  	Lastly it is suggested that Susan may have agreed to  have the
accused take them somewhere remote where they had been abandoned,
from which
they may not have wished to return, or she may have returned on her own with
the kids. The various possibilities are all
speculative, but they have a common
feature;  they all speculate on a basis of the involvement of the accused in
the disappearance
of his wife and children.
<P>

8  	Mr. Temby raises objection, firstly, on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.78</a> and, secondly, he
invokes my discretion and, as to the last of the possibilities raised, points
out that the involvement is not there
directly, but proceeds through Susan and
the circumstances in which she found herself, her marriage being at an end and
her husband
being involved with another woman.
<P>

9  	I am of the view that the speculation as to possibilities goes
too far for them to be led, in that matters of such particularity
are referred
to, and hence the prejudice is acute.  But I do not consider that, in the light
of the cross-examination, it would be
proper to restrict the Crown from
ascertaining from this witness that, although she is now of the opinion that,
absent insanity,
her brother would not be involved criminally in the death or
disappearance of the deceased, whether there was a point of time at
which she
held a contrary view.  She is as qualified to give that evidence as she was to
give the evidence in cross-examination.
<P>

10  	I do not consider, however, that it would be open to the Crown
in that regard to seek to obtain from the witness her subjective
opinion that
her brother had been lying in the story that he gave on the Friday, since the
basis for that merely appears to be that
the conversations did not make
sense.
<P>

11  	It follows that on the application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38</a> it is open to
question the witness, by leave, and I so rule, about that prior inconsistent
account, but only to the extent I have
ruled.
<P>
