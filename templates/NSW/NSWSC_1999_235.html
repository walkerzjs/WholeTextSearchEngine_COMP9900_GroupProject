<b>NR600074/90  -  ROBERT LYLE HANNA   v  HERTZ AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : This action is before the Court for assessment of damages only.
It arises out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred
on 4 July 1988.  The
Motor Accidents Act applies.
<P>

2	The plaintiff was at the time engaged in the course of his employment with
what was then known as 'Telecom' and was riding as
a passenger in a vehicle
which came into collision with another, apparently coming in the opposite
direction but crossing onto its
incorrect side of the road.  The driver of the
Telecom vehicle was in fact a Mr Halliday, who gave evidence in these
proceedings.
 He was also injured but apparently not as seriously as the
plaintiff.
<P>

3	The plaintiff was born on 26 January 1952.  So far as is relevant in his
history, he has essentially been employed as a Technical
Officer by Telecom
throughout his life.
<P>

4	A number of his fellow employees and superiors were called to give evidence.
His wife also gave testimony. Prior to the accident
I am satisfied that the
plaintiff was a talented young Technical Officer with good career prospects in
the Telecom organisation.
 He was a man of outside interests.  In particular,
he had gained a flying licence and there is a history given to one doctor by
the plaintiff that he was proceeding towards commercial rating with a possible
view to entering that field.
<P>

5	No claim is made in respect of that interest and I mention it only to
indicate that prior to the accident the plaintiff manifested
wide, varied
interests which required more than usual abilities.
<P>

6	This action has, as is obvious, been a long time in coming to hearing.  There
is no evidence before me concerning the reason for
delay but I made an inquiry
of counsel and was told that the plaintiff was reluctant to bring matters to
finality, particularly as
his employment future was a matter of some
uncertainty.  Given the evidence that I have seen, I find that understandable
and reasonable.
<P>

7	The passage of nearly eleven years has inevitably resulted in the
accumulation by both the representatives of the plaintiff and
the defendant of
a considerable volume of medical and psychological report.  I do not propose
take up time reciting what can be read
in those reports.  I would make some
observations, however.
<P>

8	The bundles of material tendered by the respective parties contain many
reports of psychological testing.  Many medical practitioners
who saw the
plaintiff remarked upon his depressed presentation.  That presentation seemed
to get worse over the years.  Regrettably,
in the entirety of the  accumulated
material there is not a single report from a psychiatrist, with the exception
of Dr Revai, with
whom consultation was arranged by the defendant but for
reasons which were explored in the evidence and are mentioned in Dr Revai's
letter, did not come to completion.  I do not think it is necessary to analyse
the particular events of that intended consultation.
 It is noteworthy that
counsel for the defendant, in the course of submission, said that he accepted
that it was quite likely that
the plaintiff really had no recollection of what
his behaviour was on that occasion.
<P>

9	I turn therefore to the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.  By far the most
immediately obvious and serious injury was the total
loss of his left eye.  He
has had difficulty in finding a satisfactory permanent prosthesis and it will
appear that there will be
a future routine of replacing at approximately two
year intervals.  The reason for this is, no doubt, that his facial structure
was
grossly disturbed by the traumatic incidents of the collision.  The side of
his face remains significantly out of ordinary structure.
<P>

10	In the years since, the plaintiff has noticed that using his remaining eye
there is a permanent black spot which moves in accordance
with his eye focus
and from time to time there are what he describes as blanks in his vision.
These are, in my view, disturbing phenomenon
in the case of a monocular person
as the plaintiff has, as a result of the injury, become.
<P>

11	The exact origin of the symptoms has been the subject of canvass in some of
the medical reports.  I am unable to determine the
exact origin but it suffices
for present purposes to find that the symptoms complained of do exist and on
the probabilities they
will not resolve.
<P>

12	The plaintiff also complains of symptoms to the head, the shoulder, the neck
and the left side of his face.  His problems in
these areas are recited in the
evidence.  There is some differentiation of view between the medical examiners
as to the seriousness
of these matters.  In my view the plaintiff does have
symptoms.  It is probable that they emerged from a combination of physical
aetiology and the plaintiff's emotional situation.
<P>

13	There is considerable discussion in the medical reports about the
possibility of frank brain damage having occurred at the time
of accident.  I
do not think the plaintiff has demonstrated, on the probabilities, that there
is actual brain damage.  A lot of the
opinion emerges from the psychological
testing.  I do not regard any of the psychologists as suitably qualified to
make diagnosis.
 A number of doctors have commented, however, upon the results
of their tests and as I have said, looking at all of the material,
and in
particular the atypical progress of the plaintiff as described, I have come to
the conclusion that frank brain damage is not
demonstrated.
<P>

14	I am, however, satisfied that the symptoms which the plaintiff manifests are
genuine and there is no basis in the evidence for
a conclusion that they will
disappear.
<P>

15	The plaintiff's progress over the past eleven years has, in my judgment,
been a descent into misery.  His emotional situation
is parlous in the extreme.
I was able, myself, to  see his flat affect as he gave evidence and this has
been the subject of comment
by medical practitioner after medical
practitioner.
<P>

16	There is description of his anger.  I am satisfied that he became and
probably remains obsessively angry about his perception
that somehow or other
his employer should have rehabilitated him and has failed to do so.  That is
not a criticism of the plaintiff.
 His personality was such that this was his
response to the culmination of severe injuries. Accordingly, in the ultimate,
the circumstance
that I have found that the origin of a lot of the plaintiff's
problems is not frank brain damage will make no practical difference
to the
assessment of damages to which he is entitled.
<P>

17	I have mentioned that a number of fellow employees and superiors were
called, which includes the plaintiff's wife. I accept their
testimony.  In
particular, I accept their descriptions of the marked change in the plaintiff
on either side of this accident.  He
was described as a man who related well to
his subordinates but after the accident he lost confidence.
<P>

18	As I shall mention later in relation to the claims for economic damage, I am
satisfied that the reality is that for ten years
between 1988 and 1998 the
plaintiff's employer essentially found things for him to occupy himself.  He
was left behind in the rapid
and wide ranging technological changes that were
especially noticeable in the communications industry.  I am satisfied that he
was
left behind because the after effects of injury made him incapable of
keeping up.
<P>

19	It is convenient to mention at this stage one piece of evidence which I
found most telling.  Mr Wallace, who is the Field Technical
Manager for the
north of New South Wales, of what is now called 'Telstra' had known the
plaintiff when they encountered each other
in 1975 at Muswellbrook.  He had
assessed the plaintiff as a technically competent, bright and good worker; a
man who did not require
supervision.
<P>

20	His later encounter post-accident showed this enormous contrast to the
extent that Mr Wallace commented that he, the plaintiff,
did not seem to be
"the same bloke".
<P>

21	The matter to which I seek to pay particular attention, however, is an
observation made by Mr Wallace of the plaintiff seeking
to work with a laptop
personal computer. The evidence demonstrates that the use of such a tool is a
frequent requirement of technical
officers employed by Telstra in the modern
context.
<P>

22	Mr Wallace became extremely concerned about the obvious lack of competence
in the plaintiff to use this tool. It takes little
imagination to understand
the difficulties the plaintiff must have encountered. I do not require
particular evidence to conclude
that looking at a laptop screen is of itself
not an easy task for a binocular person; to try and read a screen on an
extended basis
with a single eye that has a black spot and occasional blanks
must be well nigh impossible.
<P>

23	The concern of Mr Wallace was that it was his responsibility, and the
responsibility of all technical officers, to maintain network
integrity. It was
mentioned that in this area the modern switching exchange at Goonellabah is in
fact the largest in the southern
hemisphere and services 145,000 customers. An
error on the laptop by someone like the plaintiff could jeopardize the entire
integrity
of the system.
<P>

24	The result was that Mr Wallace sent the plaintiff off to the Commonwealth
medical officer. He recommended that his employment
be terminated. The field
manager, Mr Wallace, contacted the plaintiff and simply told him not to come to
work any more.  And that
has been the case since early last year.
<P>

25	The Plaintiff's employment has not in fact been terminated, and the evidence
demonstrates that the reason for this is to be found
in a policy of Telstra
apparently not to dismiss injured employees but to encourage or require them to
submit their resignation,
and to make application for their superannuation
benefit.
<P>

26	That is an unusual posture for an employer to take, but it is relevant for
present purposes to observe that in my view the plaintiff
was totally unfit for
employment as at the time of his ceasing to work and, indeed, in real terms has
not been fit to do what was
required of him since he returned after the
accident, and that he has in effect been sheltered as I earlier mentioned.
<P>

27	It is convenient to turn to the individual ingredients of damage.
<P>

28	The plaintiff claims $22,214 for out of pocket expenses. These are agreed
subject to the absence of concession by the defendant
of an ingredient of
$2,500 included in that sum for travelling expenses to obtain treatment.
Counsel for the plaintiff conceded that
there were no receipts in respect of
these expenses but pointed to a schedule of medical visits totalling
approximately two hundred
and fifty, and computed therefore that the claim
represented an average of $10 per travel. That arithmetic is beguiling, but it
needs
to be observed that the vast majority of consultations in the schedule
were with Dr Banks, who is a local doctor at Casino where
the plaintiff
resides, and I do not imagine that any real expense was incurred in visiting
him. On the other hand, $10 would be in
my view ridiculously low to estimate
the cost of a visit from Casino to Lismore, or Casino to Brisbane or
elsewhere.
<P>

29	The defendant does not suggest through its counsel that no travelling
expenses were incurred. Observing the general pattern of
consultation, and
particularly the journeys that have to be made for consultations concerning
replacement of the prosthetic eye,
I have come to the conclusion that the
figure of $2,500 represents a modest claim and is well justified by the extent
of travel.
<P>

30	Accordingly the first ingredient of damage will be out of pocket expenses of
$22,214.
<P>

31	The next item is a claim for an amount to avoid the detriment identified by
the High Court in<b> Fox v Wood</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 438.</a> The sum claimed is
$17,138. It emerges from information gained by the accountant, Mr Keep, and is
revealed in the material contained
in Exhibit D.  In the ultimate no submission
was made concerning any alternative figure, therefore, that sum will be
included in
the damages.
<P>

32	The plaintiff makes a claim for the future manufacture and fitting of a
prosthetic eye on the basis of replacement  every two
years. A written
submission was advanced on behalf of the plaintiff performing conventional
calculations, allowing for the cost of
the prostheses, travel, accommodation in
Brisbane, (where these fittings need to take place) and reducing it to a weekly
amount.
This was then capitalised on a 5 percent assumed interest rate over the
plaintiff's life expectancy. The resulting sum was $9,681.
No submission was
advanced that that sum should not be included in the damages, and accordingly
it will be so included.
<P>

33	The next items claimed by the plaintiff relate to the costs of future
medical and operative treatment. Again a written schedule
was submitted in
relation to these claims, and I will use it as a reference point for this
judgment. The first claim was for a consultation
with a general practitioner on
a monthly basis, the second claim was for an eye specialist on an annual basis,
and the third for
a consultation with a neurologist on an annual basis.
<P>

34	The evidence shows that an annual review by the latter two specialists is
regarded as reasonably requisite, and I propose to
include the calculated
amounts. The general practitioner has been consulted on an approximate basis of
once per month over a period
of years. For the purpose of establishing this I
have looked at the pattern of visits to Dr Banks, and it so happens that
randomly
selecting 1994 and 1998, in each year there have been exactly twelve
visits to Dr Banks according to the schedule. Thus a monthly
consultation in
the past represents the pattern.
<P>

35	There was a submission on behalf of the defendant in relation to all these
three matters that there was no certainty that these
consultations would take
place. As a matter of certainty the submission is obviously accurate.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that
the pattern is established and by reason of
the long delay in the action coming to hearing there is an unusually large past
pattern
to look at for the purpose of judging future probability. I think it is
more probable than not that the consultations as claimed
will take place, and I
propose, therefore, to include the amounts calculated in the damages.
<P>

36	The fourth item claimed for the plaintiff is for the cost of reconstructive
surgery to the left cheek. The items of operation,
hospital, materials and
anaesthetic are totalled at $7,280.
<P>

37	The plaintiff in cross-examination conceded that he may not in fact have
this surgery in any event. Of course on any view it
is not going to happen
immediately. The plaintiff has not seen fit to undergo this surgery for the
past eleven years. There is a
chance, however, that he will have it in the
future, and I propose to allow $2,500 to cover the chance that he decides to
have this
surgery.
<P>

38	There is a claim for travelling to and from the above medical appointments
of $3,000.  That seems to me to be reasonable given
the likely estimates of
what is required to undertake the various medical appointments. That reference
is of course principally to
the travelling to the eye specialist and the
neurologist  who are not based in Casino.
<P>

39	The final item of future medical or like expenditure claimed by the
plaintiff relates to further treatment by way  of arthroscopy
to the right
shoulder, nerve decompression and like studies to the upper limbs, and
arthroscopy to the left knee. These items total
$12,100.
<P>

40	A challenge is mounted on behalf of the defendant, in particular to the
claims concerning the right shoulder and left knee, on
the specific basis that
no particulars of such claims have been ever presented by the plaintiff to the
defendant. It is noteworthy,
however, that the submission does not go so far as
suggesting that the evidence does not support the claims. I do not regard the
absence of particulars in all the circumstances as requiring a rejection of the
plaintiff's claim, and I propose to include the full
amount.
<P>

41	I should finally observe in respect of all of these matters that the
challenges raised on behalf of the defendant were, as I
have indicated, and no
challenge was made as to the reasonableness of the estimated costs which are
ingredients of the various calculations.
<P>

42	The plaintiff's claim for all of the items totals $33,101. I have of course
rejected the claim for full payment of reconstructive
surgery to the left
cheek. Allowing for the finding that I have made, the total of ingredients is
$28,321, and I include that amount
in the damages.
<P>

43	I turn next to the plaintiff's claim for economic loss to date. The method
of calculation of a claim for $90,447 is set out in
Mr Keep's report, Exhibit
D. The loss is computed on the basis that the plaintiff would have been
promoted to a rank known as Principal
Technical Telecommunications Officer
Grade 2 in September 1994. I recognise that an estimate given by one of the
superiors, a witness
from Telstra, was that he thought the plaintiff might have
come into that grade in about 1995.
<P>

44	There is of course a great deal of approximation involved in these
predictions. The plaintiff did not attain any real promotion,
although in the
course of reconstruction of the Telecom empire people were given different
titles and designations. In my view the
estimate that the plaintiff would have
become what is called a PTTO-2 in about September 1994 is a reasonable
reflection of his probable
progress but for the intervention of the accident
and his consequential injuries.
<P>

45	I should observe that I am fortified in taking that view by the circumstance
that the annexures within Exhibit D show that there
is a further rank of
PTTO-3, and uninjured it is of course possible that the plaintiff's promotion
would not have ceased at PTTO-2,
although I accept that most of the witnesses
who knew him regarded that as his likely level of achievement.
<P>

46	It is convenient to mention now a matter raised on behalf of the defendant
both concerning past and future economic loss, and
that arises out of the
evidence of the plaintiff indicating his unwillingness to move from Casino. It
was said that therefore the
plaintiff himself placed an obstacle to his own
progress and promotion. The submission in my view does not fully recognise the
nature
of the evidence, which was that technical personnel have to be
alternatively willing to relocate or to travel. The plaintiff's personal
history was that prior to the accident he travelled all the time. Indeed,  as I
understand it, at the time of the accident he had
been working for sometime in
the Maitland area, staying there all week and returning home on weekends. As I
understand the evidence
given by the various employees of Telstra, the
technical officers are arranged into teams, and they move into areas where
projects
are undertaken, and I would assume that once the project is completed
they would need to move onto somewhere else; although of course
maintenance
would no doubt be required from time to time. It seems obvious to me, however,
that the entire installation team would
not remain in the one location for the
purpose of maintenance. 
<P>

47	In my view, the plaintiff's acknowledged intention not to move from Casino
did not provide any relevant obstacle in the past
or would it have been likely
in the future so to do in connection with his employment by Telstra.
<P>

48	I return to the ingredient of damage of past economic loss. The plaintiff
has in my view been unfit for any employment since
he ceased to attend at
Telstra. As I have said, I accept the basis of calculation in Exhibit D, and
accordingly I include within
the damages $90,447 computed in accordance with
that exhibit.
<P>

49	I turn next to the claim for interference with economic capacity in the
future. A submission was made on behalf of the defendant
that the capitalised
figure for total economic loss for the balance of the plaintiff's notional
working life of $500,382 does not
compute. Reference was made to the schedule
on page 7 of Exhibit D which showed during the last complete year of wage
earning an
average nett wage of approximately $730 extracted from the annual
figure of $38,002. The plaintiff countered this submission by pointing
out that
the entirety of Exhibit D showed that there had been as a result of industrial
negotiation of a work place agreement two
future wage rises which, had the
plaintiff been in employment, would inevitably have been received pursuant to
that agreement. In
addition, the plaintiff's claim was based upon the
assumption of promotion that I have indicated I accept in relation to his claim
for past economic loss.
<P>

50	The acquisition of this was dependent upon the plaintiff accepting
employment with a corporation described at page 9 of Exhibit
D as NPC Limited,
although I believe from other material that is probably a typing error, and the
corporation should be NDC Limited.
 I gather that this is a corporation which
exists for the purpose of employing Telstra employees. No suggestion was made
that the
acceptance of employment was other than a formal step in one of the
many restructures of what has been known from time to time as
Telecom and
Telstra.
<P>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=51%20Page%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">51	Page 9</a> of exhibit D sets out the arithmetical method by which the sum of
$500,382 was reached. I am satisfied that assuming a 5 percent
discount rate,
that figure represents the loss of total probable income by the plaintiff as an
employee of Telstra or its employment
corporation for the balance of his
notional working life. That figure assumes of course a working life
uninterrupted by any reason
until the plaintiff's retirement at age 65.
<P>

52	Senior counsel for the plaintiff invited a discount of what can be called
the conventional 15 percent in order to allow for any
excess of adverse over
favourable vicissitudes during the period involved. Counsel for the defendant
submitted that there should
be further discount in order to take account of the
plaintiff's residual earning capacity.
<P>

53	That leads me to consider whether the evidence shows that the plaintiff has
such residual capacity. In recent times the plaintiff
has made some inquiry of
Centrelink. But of course he is in receipt of compensation payments from the
employer, and he has not done
anything active about seeking employment. Leaving
aside, but not ignoring, the other disabilities of which the plaintiff
complains,
I find it unlikely that any employer would seek to offer employment
to someone in the situation of the plaintiff, that is to say
monocular, and
with significant disabilities in the eye.
<P>

54	The plaintiff, as I indicated, was a person prior to the accident of many
interests. One matter was that he in fact built his
own home, although as I
understand it he sub-contracted out things like brickwork, plumbing, but
nevertheless his significant contribution
to that work does indicate that he
has the breadth of talent to which I have made reference.
<P>

55	I do not regard those talents as altogether evaporated as a result of the
accident. It seems to me that on balance, and on probability,
the plaintiff may
over the ensuing years earn some money exercising in some way the residual
talents which he has. I regard, however,
the likelihood of permanent employment
as remote. I have determined, therefore, to approach the matter in this
fashion. As I have
indicated, I accept the integrity of the calculation leading
to a capital sum of $500,382.  Discounted for vicissitudes that figure
reduces
to $425,384. That discount being 15 percent as submitted by senior counsel. I
propose then to apply a discount to that figure
of 10 percent to represent
exercise of earning capacity by the plaintiff during the balance of his working
life. That would result
in a lump sum of $382,845. I am conscious of the
arithmetical difference of performing the discounts in two stages  from taking
a
discount of 25 percent, the latter method would reduce the sum by a slightly
larger amount. In my view the approach that I have indicated
is appropriate in
this case. Accordingly, I propose to include $382,845 for future economic loss
in the award of damage.
<P>

56	The final item is an award for non economic loss.  It is agreed that the
figure pertinent to a most extreme case is $259,000.
 Counsel for the plaintiff
submitted that given the age of the plaintiff at the time of accident and given
the extent of his injuries
that applying the statutory duty to proportion I
would conclude that 85 percent was appropriate. I am conscious of course that
the
proportion must be done against a most extreme case, not against the worst
case one could imagine.
<P>

57	These matters are always the result of impression.  I have sought to
indicate that I regard the plaintiff's complaints as genuine.
 In
cross-examination both he and his wife conceded that this case had been the
source of much worry and that they would both be
relieved when it was over. So
far as the plaintiff is concerned, I have no doubt that is true but by the same
token I am unpersuaded
that the relief at the conclusion of litigation is
likely to ameliorate the symptoms from which the plaintiff suffers, whether
sourced
 from physical or emotional bases.  I have come to the conclusion that
the appropriate proportion is 75 percent and I will therefore
include an
ingredient for non economic loss of $194,250. 
<P>

58	I summarise then the ingredients of damage which I have found:
