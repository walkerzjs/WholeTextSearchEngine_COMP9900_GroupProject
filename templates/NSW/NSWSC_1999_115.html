GREG JAMES, J.
<P>

WEDNESDAY 24 FEBRUARY 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. CHRISTIAN MATTHEW GILLETT</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	Christian Matthew Gillett was indicted before me on a charge that on 5 April
1998 at Mona Vale in the State of New South Wales
he did maliciously wound
Keith Gillett, his father.
<P>

2	Although the former Chief Justice has issued Practice Note 98 in respect of
the presentation of indictments in this court in respect
of charges other than
murder, piracy, treason and offences which are required by statute to be
prosecuted in this court, the matter
has proceeded here since the accused was
originally indicted in this court for murder, however the Crown has elected to
proceed only
for malicious wounding, there being some doubt as to whether the
death of Mr. Keith Gillett was occasioned by the acts of the accused.
 The
accused had been arraigned in this court and committed to this court.  The
matter has been listed here and all the evidence
may be conveniently given.
<P>

3	The accused had elected, by a written election of 5 November 1998 signed by
him, for trial by judge alone pursuant to s.32 of
the Criminal Procedure Act.
That election records, as is required by s.32(1)(b), that the accused received
advice from Siobhan Mullany,
solicitor, in relation to the election and that as
required by s.32(3), the prosecutor, T.R. Hoyle, SC., consents to the election
on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The evidence has been
provided to me in documentary form in a convenient volume
by consent.  This
volume is marked Exhibit A.  In all the circumstances I would not in the
exercise of my discretion under s.16A
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act 1986</a>,
reject the indictment.
<P>

4	The matter can conveniently proceed in this court.
<P>

5	The evidence discloses events of a deeply tragic nature affecting the accused
and his father and mother.
<P>

6	Shortly, written admissions under s.184 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> tendered before
me, record that the accused on the advice of his lawyer, Mr. D. Humphreys of
the Legal Aid Commission, admits that
as at 5 April 1998 he resided with his
father, the deceased, at 27 Surf View Road, Mona Vale and was observed shortly
after 10.00
am that day running from that residence.  At 10.18 am, the
ambulance station at Narrabeen received a call to attend to a male who
had been
assaulted at that address and upon the police arriving at 10.22 am, Keith
Gillett, a double amputee, was found lying on
the floor behind his wheelchair
suffering from wounds that had clearly been inflicted by a mattock which was
lying a short distance
away.  He informed the police that he had been attacked
by the accused with the mattock.
<P>

7	Statements show that at 10.05 am on 6 April 1998, after visiting his mother's
place of work, the accused was apprehended by police
and taken to North Sydney
Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview.
At the time of his apprehension,
he appears to have been delusional, as is
evidenced by his statements to the arresting police.
<P>

8	The transcript of the electronically recorded interview has been tendered in
evidence.  Many of the answers contained in it, as
are noted by Dr. Nielssen,
psychiatrist, in his report of 30 November 1998, are indicative of the accused
suffering from mental illness
acutely at that time.  Dr. Nielssen, who gave
oral evidence before me this morning, confirmed this.  The accused denied that
he had
attacked his father.  He appears to have asserted that denial while of
the view that to do such a thing as was alleged to a man he
liked would be
terrible and thus it would have been unlikely for him to have so acted,
although he also claimed a lack of memory
for the relevant period.
<P>

9	Also tendered in evidence is the statement of Natalie Anne Rosa who saw the
accused run from the house shortly prior to the ambulance
arriving (and
therefore shortly after the attack), the statements of the police officers to
whom the accused's father complained
of the attack on him by the accused, the
ambulance officers' statements and those of medical practitioners establishing
the severity
of the wounds to Mr. Gillett and that he died on 15 April 1998
during his recovery from those wounds.
<P>

10	In addition, there was evidence from the accused's mother that from the age
of 14 his behaviour had commenced to change until
it became obvious by his late
teens that the accused was suffering from a psychiatric illness.  Over the
years the police have had
to be called on a number of occasions and the accused
was, in about 1990, admitted to and assessed at the Royal North Shore Hospital,
Cummins Unit.  Whilst at this unit he medicated regularly.
<P>

11	Mrs. Gillett states that on about 6 May 1991, the accused attacked her with
an iron bar, occasioning her severe injuries.  He
was apprehended and whilst
detained at Long Bay Gaol was diagnosed by Dr. Westmore as suffering from
schizophrenia and from that
time on was medicated regularly with Haldol,
complying with a community treatment order administered most recently through
the Mona
Vale Hospital.  She remained in constant contact with Keith and
Christian although living apart from them since the 1991 attack,
the father and
son having continued living together.  She became aware that during the last
six months, the accused had been using
alcohol.
<P>

12	The attack is entirely consistent, in the opinion of the psychiatrists, Dr.
Westmore who provided reports dated 14 April 1998
and 16 November 1998 and Dr.
Nielssen who provided a report dated 30 November 1998 and gave oral evidence
this morning, with that
on the mother and with the accused's condition, as the
psychiatrists diagnosed it.
<P>

13	Their reports disclose that they are both of the view that the accused was,
at the time of the wounding of his father, suffering
acutely from a psychosis,
schizophrenia;  that even if he were aware of the nature and quality of his
act, he would have been deprived,
on the balance of probability, from knowing
that he ought not to do the act.
<P>

14	Dr. Nielssen, who has cared for the accused in the gaol system since shortly
after his arrest, gave evidence and confirmed the
diagnosis that he agreed with
the view of Dr. Westmore.
<P>

15	Dr. Nielssen's report was provided to the Crown, puts the matter as
follows:-
<P>

	"Mr. Gillett has a severe disabling form of mental illness which developed
after a prodromal illness during which there was a marked
disturbance of
conduct, followed by the onset of acute psychotic symptoms of auditory
hallucinations, ideas of reference and persecutory
delusional beliefs."
<P>

16	The doctor went on to characterise the condition as schizophrenia and to
note that the assault on the mother occurred during
an acute episode induced by
taking hallucinogenic trips and that the acute episode which resulted in the
attack on the father was
similarly induced;  these episodes were characterised
by the hallucinations, ideas of reference and persecutory delusional beliefs
referred to:-
<P>

	"The reason Mr. Gillett assaulted his father was that he believed his father
was trying to kill him and he [was] prompted by persuasive
auditory
hallucinations arising from an acute exacerbation of his chronic mental
illness.
<P>

	I believe Mr. Gillett has the defence of mental illness open to him.  He had a
defect of reason in the form of a delusional belief
that his father planned to
kill him, owing to a disease of the mind, an acute exacerbation of chronic
schizophrenia.  He was aware
of the nature and quality of his act but did not
realise that the act was wrong, as he believed that his father was actually
planning
to harm him and he was prompted by persuasive auditory
hallucinations."
<P>

17	On the accused's arrival at the Corrective Services institution following
his arrest, he was diagnosed as floridly psychotic.
 Subsequently he has, on
medication, been restored to his previous level of functioning and has received
treatment with anti-depressant
medication and counselling to help him accept
the loss of his father.  There is no issue but that he was fit to plead, and to
make
the election for trial and the admissions I have referred to above.  There
is plainly sufficient evidence he committed the acts which
would have, except
for the effect of mental illness, constituted the offence.
<P>

18	To Dr. Nielssen he confessed that he had attacked his father in response to
a voice saying "Axe him", although this admission
was made at a time when he
was suffering from disordered thought, his cognitive function being clearly
affected by the presence of
the chronic mental illness.
<P>

19	He had, to Dr. Westmore, on that doctor's initial examination on 11 April
1998, asserted that he wasn't there at the time and
that he was not sure who
had hurt his father.  He had denied any memory of the incident later in the
interview.  He had denied the
attack to Dr. Nielssen at one stage.
<P>

20	Notwithstanding his denials which no doubt proceed from a lucid realisation
of the circumstances of the tragedy and a desire
to reject his role in it, on
considering the whole of the evidence I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused inflicted
the wounds the victim suffered and that those wounds
were inflicted with intent to injure:  <b>Regina v. Stokes &amp; Difford
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2051%20A%20Crim%20R%2025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 51 A. Crim. R. 25.</a>  Subject to the matter to which I will turn
shortly, I am satisfied of all the elements of the offence of which the accused
is charged
beyond reasonable doubt.  The presence of the accused at the scene,
his fleeing the scene, the very nature of the attack and its
consistency with
his mental condition support my conclusion that those elements are made out to
the requisite standard.
<P>

21	There remains however, the matter of mental illness.  It is only necessary
that  this be established on balance of probabilities.
 I am entirely satisfied
that the accused was mentally ill.  The doctors are both of the view that the
accused was, at the relevant
time, psychotic.  Their evidence in this respect
is consistent with previous diagnoses and the relevant events.  Their views are
unanimous and unchallenged.  I accept them.  Therefore I find that at the time
of the commission of the acts, the accused had the
defence provided for those
suffering from mental illness so as not to be responsible according to law for
his actions.  That is to
say he was labouring under such a defect of reason
from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he
was
doing or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was
wrong:  <b>Regina v. M'Naghten</b> (1843) 8 ER 718;  <b>Regina v. Porter</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55 CLR 182</a> at 188;  and s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure)
Act 1900.
<P>

22	Being so satisfied, I return the special verdict required by s.38 of the
Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, that is,
that the accused is not
guilty by reason of mental illness and make the order required by s.39 of that
Act, that is, that he be detained
in such place and in such manner as the court
thinks fit until released by due process of law.
<P>

23	Christian Matthew Gillett, I order that you be detained in strict custody at
the A Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital and thereafter
in such other place
as is determined according to law until you are released by due process of
law.
