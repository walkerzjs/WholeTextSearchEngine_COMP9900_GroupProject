			<b>  Voyager/Melbourne collision)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 8 August
1996 seeks an extension of time within which to commence proceedings pursuant
to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> </b>1969 (NSW) (the Act).  The
plaintiff relied on his affidavits sworn 10 November 1998, 22 March 1999 and 21
May 1999.  The defendant
did not rely on any affidavit evidence.  The defendant
neither consented nor opposed the orders sought.
<P>

2  	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
In doing so, I have taken the plaintiff's case at its highest.
 Should the
matter go to trial some of these facts will be disputed.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 10 June 1945.  He now resides in Victoria.
<P>

(2)	On 2 July 1962 shortly before the plaintiff's 17th birthday he was accepted
for enlistment as a recruit in the Royal Australia
Navy for an engagement of 9
years.  He was in good health both physically and psychologically.  A copy of
the medical examination
record of 7 June 1992 confirms the state of his
health.
<P>

(3)	On 10 February 1964 the plaintiff was a crew member of the aircraft carrier
HMAS Melbourne.  On that day the Melbourne was involved
in joint exercises with
the destroyer HMAS Voyager.
<P>

(4)	On 10 February 1964 at approximately 2056 hours Eastern Standard time a
collision occurred between the aircraft carrier HMAS
Melbourne and the
destroyer HMAS Voyager at sea about 20 miles south east of Jervis Bay (the
collision).  Eighty two men from the
Voyager lost their lives in the
collision.
<P>

(5)	At the time of the collision the plaintiff was on the "Goofa deck" (the
observation deck) behind the Bridge and was watching
"the night flying".  The
Melbourne was looking for wind and after it completed a turn the plaintiff
could see the Voyager from the
starboard side of the Melbourne.  The plaintiff
watched for about two or three minutes knowing that a collision was inevitable.
In
hindsight the plaintiff believes that he could have prevented the collision
by turning on the signal light.  He believed this would
have given the Voyager
sufficient warning of the impending collision.  The plaintiff has later told Dr
Wu (see report 25 February
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1996%20Exch%20DWR1" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1996 Ex DWR1)</a> that he did not do anything because he
was sticking to the Royal Australian Navy regulation of absence of independent
action.  The
plaintiff says that this has played heavily on his mind ever
since.  
<P>

The plaintiff felt the impact of the Voyager on collision and was shocked to
see the aft section scraping along the starboard side.
 There was a great deal
of noise and the sound of scraping metal.  The plaintiff went to action station
4 Alpha near the bow where
the holding cells and the heads (toilets) were
located.  He checked the holding cells and the heads to see if anyone was
there. 
The whole area had been crushed.  The plaintiff secured the area as
best he could then went back to the mess watched survivors come
aboard and was
looking for his mate among the survivors.  The plaintiff subsequently learned
that his mate "Leggie" had perished.
<P>

(6)	Following the sinking of the Voyager and the loss of his friends the
plaintiff suffered from extreme guilt feelings and became
progressively anxious
and stressed.
<P>

(7)	As at 10 February 1970 the plaintiff had no knowledge of the precise cause
or causes of the collision.
<P>

(8)	In June 1970 the plaintiff was diagnosed as having a duodenal ulcer.  The
Navy records in relation to the diagnosis and treatment
he received are
available.
<P>

(9)	On 1 July 1971 the plaintiff was discharged from the Navy.  He was not
asked to stay on and believes that this may have been
because of his medical
problems and lack of motivation.
<P>

(10)	Following the plaintiff's discharge from the Navy he drank and smoked to
excess and continued to suffer from depression and
anxiety.
<P>

(11)	In April 1972 the plaintiff separated from his wife.  They later divorced.
In 1978 the plaintiff remarried.
<P>

(12)	From 1972 to 1980 the plaintiff had various short term jobs.  Since 1980
the plaintiff has been in regular employment and for
the last 10 years he has
been employed by CEM International Pty Limited.  He currently holds the
position of Purchasing Officer.
<P>

(13)	In 1991 Dr Kronborg reported that the plaintiff was diagnosed as having a
ulcerative reflux oesophagitis and duodenitis.  Dr
Kronborg also reported that
the plaintiff consumed alcohol excessively.  The plaintiff was aware that when
he smoked he got increased
levels of pain and the doctor suggested he go on a
Nicorette withdrawal programme.
<P>

(14)	Since the sinking of the Voyager the plaintiff has always found difficulty
coping in work situations.  He has experienced difficulty
handling pressure and
often becomes aggressive and abusive.  The plaintiff says that he was aware
that he had an attitude problem
due to his anxiety, stress and depression.  He
did not seek psychiatric help.  It was in about 1996 that the plaintiff was
advised
that he should seek treatment.  The plaintiff says that until 1996 he
did not understand that the collision and its aftermath caused
or was capable
of causing him psychiatric injury or damage.
<P>

(15)	On 25 February 1996 the plaintiff consulted Dr Wu.  After that
consultation he became aware that he suffered a psychiatric
disorder, namely a
dysthymic disorder.  He understood that the various symptoms he had experienced
in his life since the sinking
of the Voyager were attributable to the
psychiatric disorder.
<P>

(16)	On 8 August 1996 the statement of claim and notice of motion seeking an
extension of the limitation period were filed.
<P>

(17)	In April 1998 the plaintiff suffered chest pain and collapsed while at
home in the shower.  In hospital he was given electric
shock treatment to
revive him.  He was told by a doctor that he had suffered a heart attack.  This
was the first time that he had
any knowledge that he had a heart problem.  
<P>

(18)	On 12 March 1999 the plaintiff was examined by Dr Rosenbaum, a
cardiologist.  It was at this consultation that the plaintiff
first understood
that it was highly likely that his psychiatric condition was a cause of his
heart condition.  Dr Rosenbaum informed
the plaintiff that anxiety and stress
had contributed to his heart condition as had his smoking which was also caused
by stress.
 The plaintiff had no knowledge that the collision had contributed
to his heart condition until Dr Rosenbaum informed him.  Dr Rosenbaum
also
informed the plaintiff that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD).
<P>

(19)	Dr Rosenbaum in his report dated 12 March 1999 (EX DWR5) diagnosed the
plaintiff as suffering from excess cigarette intake,
excess alcohol intake,
mild obesity, elevated cholesterol and chronic peptic ulcer, coronary artery
disease, peripheral vascular
disease and severe anxiety and depression with
associate feelings of guilt.
<P>

	Dr Rosenbaum conceded that the speciality of psychiatry was outside his area
of specialist knowledge.  However he stated that the
plaintiff was subjected to
an enormous amount of emotional stress associated with guilt at the time of the
Voyager incident.  It
seemed highly likely that this had been a cause of
substantive PTSD associated with anxiety and depression.  According to Dr
Rosenbaum
the Voyager diaster can be regarded as a substantive predisposing
factor to the onset of both the cardiac and the peripheral vascular
disease.
<P>

(20)	On 17 March 1999 the plaintiff was interviewed by Dr William Knox,
Consultant Psychiatrist.  During the course of that interview
the doctor
informed the plaintiff that he actually was suffering from PTSD.  This was the
first time the plaintiff was positively
diagnosed as suffering from that
disorder.  Dr Wu in his report dated 25 February 1996 was of the view that the
plaintiff did not
fulfil the criteria necessary to diagnose PTSD.  This
conflicts with the opinion of Dr Knox and whether the plaintiff suffers from
PTSD will be an issue in dispute at the trial.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

3  	The plaintiff relies on s 60G of the Act.  The approach to be
adopted in dealing with applications for the extension of limitation
periods,
is that which has been expounded in recent times in <b><u>Brisbane South
Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a> and
in <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors)</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported, 7 March 1997) and <b><u>The Commonwealth of Australia v
McLean</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 393.</a>  The onus rests with the applicant.  In
relation to ss 60G and 60I(1)(a) as to the satisfying of the relevant threshold
requirements,
it must be shown that it is just and reasonable to make an order.

<P>

4  	I turn now to ss 60G and 60I(1)(a) which are in subdivision (3)
of the Act.  The procedure provided by this group of provisions
is available
for causes of action that accrue after 1 September 1990;  but "also (by the
operation of Schedule 5) for causes of action
that accrued before that date" (s
60F).
<P>

5  	Schedule 5 provides by clause 4(1) that:
<P>

<b>"Section 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued
or would have
accrued before 1 September 1990...";</b>
<P>

6  	and clause 4(4) empowers the court to make an order under s 60G
in respect of such a cause of action:
<P>

<b>"...if an application for such order is made within:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the period of three years referred to in s 60I;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the period of three years commencing 1 September 1990."</b>
<P>

7  	The application to extend time was made on 8 August 1996 which is
outside the time stipulated in clause 4(4)(b).  The application
can only
succeed if that date is shown to be "within the period of three years referred
to in s 60I".
<P>

8  	Section 60G empowers the court to extend the limitation period,
if it is just and reasonable to do so, "for such period as it
determines".
<P>

9  	The relevant provisions of s 60I are as follows:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under s 60G or 60H unless it is satisfied
that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

10  	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of s 60G, the
plaintiff must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at 10 February 1970 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period)
he was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in s 60I(1)(a)(i), (ii)
or (iii).
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in s 60I(1)(a) (or the last of those matters
to become known to him)
earlier than 8 August 1993.
<P>

11  	The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to identify
specifically what fact or facts he claims not to have known as
at 10 February
1970, which lack of knowledge meets the description in one or more of
paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of s 60I(1)(a);
 and to show by (evidence) the
date on which he acquired knowledge thereof (being a date later than 8 August
1993);  or to show that
that fact was or those facts were still unknown to him
on that date.  The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff ought to have
become aware of the matters listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date -
see s 60I(1)(b). 
<P>

12  	The plaintiff relies on s 60I(1)(a)(i) and (ii) in relation to
five disorders namely, firstly, coronary artery disease, secondly,
peripheral
vascular disease, thirdly, psychiatric injury which includes diagnosis
depression, PTSD and dysthymea, fourthly, substance
abuse and fifthly, cardiac
infarction.  The statement of claim will need to be amended to plead these
injuries, some of which have
become known to the plaintiff after the statement
of claim was filed.
<P>

<b> (i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that "did not know that personal
injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

Prior to the expiration of the limitation period, the plaintiff knew that he
suffered from extreme guilt feelings and became progressively
anxious and
stressed.  He knew he had gastric problems.  In 1991 he knew he had an
ulcerative reflux oesophagitis .  After the limitation
period expired the
plaintiff was aware that he drank and smoked to excess and that he suffered
from depression.  It is difficult
to ascertain what the plaintiff meant by
depression.  He may be using the expression to denote nothing more than his
experience of
short periods where he felt unhappy or he may have experienced
symptoms which were far more serious.  There are similar symptomatology
which
will lead to a diagnosis of depression and dysthymic disorder.  However, it was
not until 25 February 1996 that the plaintiff
became aware that he suffered
from a diagnosable psychiatric illness namely dysthymic disorder.  
<P>

13  	Dr Wu based his diagnosis on the criteria described within the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition,
1994 of the
American Psychiatric Association (DSMIV).  There are 4 criteria that need to be
satisfied.  The essential feature of
dysthymic disorder is a chronically
depressed mood that occurs for most of the day more days than not, for at least
2 years.  The
criteria for the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder are similar to
the criteria for a diagnosis of depression.
<P>

14  	In 1998 the plaintiff first became aware that he had a heart
problems and that it was likely that his psychiatric condition
was the cause of
his heart condition.  In March 1999 the plaintiff became aware that the
collision was the cause of his excess cigarette
smoking and alcohol intake and
substantive predisposing factor to the onset of both the cardiac and peripheral
vascular disease.
 The 1999 diagnosis of PTSD does not assist the plaintiff as
in 1996 he was aware that he suffered from a diagnosed psychiatric injury.
 It
is my view that prior to 8 August 1993 the plaintiff knew that he had suffered
a personal injury of depression even though it
had not been diagnosed by a
psychiatrist.  He knew that he had suffered personal injury This falls outside
the period stipulated
by s 60I(1)(b)(i).  The plaintiff has not passed through
the s 60I(1)(a)(i) gateway.  
<P>

<b>(ii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of the nature
and extent of the personal injury suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

15  	The test of knowledge posed by s 60I(1)(a)(ii) requires the
court to look at the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither
the
reasonableness of that awareness nor constructive knowledge is an element of s
60I(1)(a) - (<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186
CLR 1</a> at pp 9 and 10).  <b><u>Harris</u></b> is a case of a disease of gradual
onset.
<P>

16  	The nature and extent of the injury which the plaintiff has
sustained is to be determined as an objective fact as at the date
of the
hearing of the application.  A plaintiff may be held to have been aware of the
nature or extent of his injury within the relevant
period if during that period
he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having upon him and of its
likely future course,
even though he may have been unaware of the precise
pathology or medical diagnosis.  In particular if the applicant was aware that
the injury would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the
injury for the purpose of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) even though the
injury developed
particular consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee.  As long
as the consequences are of a kind
that an applicant expects, the applicant will
be aware of the extent of the injury (<b><u>Harris</u></b> pp 13 and 14).
<P>

17  	As previously stated prior to the expiration of the limitation
period, the plaintiff knew that he suffered from extreme guilt
feelings and
became progressively anxious and stressed.  He knew he had gastric problems.
After the limitation period expired the
plaintiff was aware that he drank and
smoked to excess and that he suffered from depression.  In 1991 he knew he had
an ulcerative
reflux oesophagitis.  However, it was not until 25 February 1996
that the plaintiff became aware that he suffered from a diagnosable
psychiatric
illness namely a dysthymic disorder which was attributable to the sinking of
the Voyager.  In 1998 the plaintiff first
became aware that he had a heart
problem and that it was likely that his psychiatric condition was the cause of
his heart condition.
 In 1998 he became aware he had coronary artery disease
and peripheral vascular disease.  It was not until after February 1996 that
the
plaintiff did become aware he had serious long term medical problems such as
dysthymic disorder, PTSD and heart problems.  It
is my view that the plaintiff
has passed through the 60I(1)(a)(ii) gateway.
<P>

<b><u>Just and reasonable</u></b>
<P>

18  	I turn now to consider whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period.  Firstly, I turn to consider whether
the
plaintiff has a real case to advance.  In relation to s 60G, the applicant
bears an evidentiary and persuasive onus which, in
the absence of concession,
requires material to be adduced which demonstrates that the dilatory plaintiff
has a real case to advance.
 The need for the court to decide that it is just
and reasonable to extend the limitation period must focus attention on the
question
whether there is indeed evidence to establish the plaintiff's cause of
action.  It would rarely be possible to say that it was just
and reasonable to
subject the defendant to litigation otherwise statute barred if it did not
appear that there was evidence available
to the plaintiff to establish her
cause of action.  (See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported
Badgery-Parker J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Ortado v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC,
unreported, Badgery-Parker J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Lewis v Bailey</u></b>
(NSWSC, unreported, Badgery-Parker J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Council of the City
of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (unreported, NSWCA, 26 February 1998) and <b><u>Dow
Corning Australia Pty Ltd v Paton</u></b>, <b><u>Meares v Paton</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported 24 April 1998) and <b><u>Fitzgerald v Bankstown City Council</u></b>
(NSWCA, unreported 6 November 1995)).
<P>

19  	The plaintiff was employed by the defendant.  The defendant as
an employer had a duty of care to the plaintiff.  The foreseeability
of the
plaintiff's damage will be in issue at the trial.  It is the plaintiff's
contention that as a result of his experience of
being on board the Melbourne
when it was hit by the Voyager he suffered firstly, coronary artery disease,
secondly, peripheral vascular
disease, thirdly, psychiatric injury which
includes diagnosis depression, PTSD and dysthymea, fourthly, substance abuse
and fifthly,
cardiac infarction.  There is medical evidence to support that the
plaintiff suffers from these disorders which can be attributed
to the collision
- see <b><u>McLean</u></b>.  There is medical opinion had he not been involved
in the collision he would have progressed with his career in the Navy.  From
1972 to 1980 the plaintiff was in periodical short term employment.  Hence,
there is evidence to establish that the plaintiff has
a real cause of action to
advance.
<P>

20  	I turn now to <b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  In
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J at pages 8 and 9 referred to the effects of delay
in the now often quoted passage which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Secondly, it
is oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought
long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Thirdly,
people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on
the basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

21  	and at page 11:
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.  In such a situation, actual injustice
to
one party must occur.  It seems more in accord with the legislative policy
underlying limitation periods that the plaintiff's
lost right should not be
revived than that the defendant should have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

22  	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

<b>"The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised in
favour of an applicant lies on the applicant.  To discharge
that onus the
applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant
prejudice to the prospective
defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a
limitation period, to allow
the commencement of an action outside that period
is  prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the
benefit
of the limitation."</b>
<P>

23  	McHugh J at p 10 continued:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question.  </b>
<P>

<b>Accordingly, when an applicant seeks an extension of time to commence an
action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has
the positive burden
of demonstrating that the justice of the case requires that extension."</b>
<P>

24  	In <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> the Court of Appeal considered the
effect of <b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to the extension of the limitation
period of a case which falls into subdivision 2 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b>
1969 - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a>.  
<P>

25  	Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  The President quoted the passage by McHugh J
which begins "Legislatures enact" and was of the view that Dawson J agreed with
McHugh J.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that Dawson J and
McHugh J appeared to indicate that it is mandatory
that the applicant negate
"significant prejudice" before the discretion could be exercised in his or her
favour.  Mason P then referred
to the following state by Toohey and Gummow JJ
(in their joint judgment) at page 7:
<P>

<b> "The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair
trial unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the
discretion should not
be exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

26  	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the
notion of "significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances
of a fair trial unlikely".  In determining whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period in this
application I will examine whether the
delay has made "the chances of a fair trial unlikely" or whether the defendants
would suffer
"significant prejudice".
<P>

27  	I accept that with the passing of 35 years, there is the real
possibility that some witnesses may not be available to give
evidence at the
trial.  It can also be expected that memories will have faded with the
effluxion of time.  Indisputably there is
presumptive prejudice. 
<P>

28  	Generally speaking, the lengthy delay may well confront the
defendant with a difficult task in investigating a claim for damages.
 There
are navy records showing that at the time the plaintiff joined the Navy he was
in good physical and psychological health.
 The events surrounding the
collision between the Melbourne and Voyager are well known and there is
documentary evidence available
- see <b><u>McLean;</u></b>  <b><u>Lynch v The
Commonwealth of Australia</u></b> and <b><u>Parici v The Commonwealth of
Australia</u></b> (Master Harrison, NSWSC unreported 16 October 1998 and 14
April 1999 respectively).  There are also decisions in relation to extension
of
time of the limitation period for Voyager/Melbourne claims by Master Malpass.
In the case before me, there are more recent records
of Drs Norton, Kronborg,
Wu, Rosenbaum and Knox which are available.  Nearly all of  these doctors are
available to give evidence
with the exception of Dr Wu who has since died. 
<P>

29  	After I have taken into account all of these matters,  I am not
satisfied that the "chances of the defendant obtaining a fair
trial is
unlikely" nor am I satisfied that the defendant will suffer "significant
prejudice".  The plaintiff has discharged his onus
and satisfied me that it is
just and reasonable that an order be made that the limitation period be
extended.  The parties agreed
that appropriate order for costs is that costs be
costs in the cause.
<P>

30  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings in this court for damages in respect of an
accident which occurred
on 10 February 1964 up to and including 8 August 1996.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to file and serve an amended statement of claim within 21
days.
<P>

(3)	Cost be costs in the cause.
<P>
