<b>3470/98	KONECRANES PTY LIMITED &amp; ANOR   -v-   VAUGHN STEPHENS &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These proceedings were instituted by summons
filed by the first plaintiff, Konecranes Pty Limited, on 7 August 1998.  The
defendants
named in this summons were Vaughn Stephens and Crane Pro Pty
Limited.  Subsequently, on 1 August 1998 an amended summons was filed.
 That
amended summons named an additional plaintiff, KCI Konecranes International
PLC.  The first plaintiff is a subsidiary of the
second plaintiff.
<P>

2   	The substantive proceedings related to confidential
material and information asserted by the plaintiffs to have been taken
from
them and retained by the first defendant, who was a former employee of the
first plaintiff, and to have been used by the first
defendant and by the second
defendant, a company set up by the first defendant, which has been carrying on
business in competition
to the first plaintiff.
<P>

3   	The first plaintiff on 7 August 1998, the date of the
institution of the proceedings, obtained an order of the nature known
as an
Anton Pillar Order.
<P>

4   	Subsequently orders were made by consent of the parties on
12 August 1998 and again on 14 August 1998.  Those orders, which
were made by
consent and without admission, had the ultimate practical effect of bringing to
a conclusion most of the matters which
were in dispute between the parties in
the present litigation.
<P>

5   	There did, however, remain outstanding two aspects of that
dispute.  One was the claim for damages which had been made by the
plaintiffs
in both the summons and the amended summons.  The other was the claim in
respect to certain entitlements relating to the
employment of the first
defendant by the first plaintiff which has subsequently become the subject of
proceedings in the Industrial
Relations Commission of New South Wales.  Those
proceedings were instituted by the first defendant against the first plaintiff
by
a summons for relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/s106.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 106</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ira1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Industrial Relations Act
</i>1996</a>, which was filed on 11 August 1998.
<P>

6   	After the making of the various consent orders, which
included orders for the delivery up by the defendants of the various
pieces of
material referred to in prayer 1 of the amended summons, and various
undertakings for injunctive relief against the defendants
and various orders by
the defendants, the only substantive part of the claim of the plaintiffs still
outstanding was their claim
for damages. 
<P>

7   	The matter in due course was entered into the Masters' list
on 17 December 1998. On 26 May 1999 it was fixed to be heard before
me this
day, 11 June 1999.  When it was fixed for hearing the Court was informed that
the only matter which was to be argued this
day was the question of costs.  The
Court was informed both then and again at today's hearing that the plaintiffs
did not wish to
pursue any claim for damages.
<P>

8   	Today's hearing, as a consequence, is a hearing in respect
to the costs of the proceedings.  
<P>

9   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that they
are entitled to have an order made that the defendants should pay
the costs of
the plaintiffs of the proceedings and that those costs should be on the
indemnity basis.  Essentially, the grounds upon
which the plaintiffs claim
those costs is that the proceedings related to confidential material and
information asserted by the plaintiffs
to be held by their former employee, the
first defendant; that, so it is submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs, the
first defendant
lied about his possession of that material, which, according to
the plaintiffs, he had stolen from them, and he returned that material
to the
plaintiffs only as a result of the court proceedings which, so it is submitted,
it was necessary for the plaintiffs to institute
in order to recover their
property.
<P>

10   	The defendants, on the other hand, have submitted that,
not only should no costs order be made against the defendants in favour
of the
plaintiffs, but that the clear effect of the orders made by consent and without
admissions on 12 and 14 August 1998 was that
the parties contemplated that each
party would bear its or his own costs of the proceedings.
<P>

11   	It has further been submitted on behalf of the defendants
that, contrary to its primary submission, if the Court is disposed
to make any
costs order against the defendants, then such costs order should not be on the
indemnity basis but should be on the party
and party basis.
<P>

12   	The orders which were made on 12 and 14 August 1998 did
not contain any reference to costs.  It does not seem to me, in those
circumstances, that any party to the proceedings is precluded from making an
application in respect to costs.
<P>

13   	Where the orders are silent as to costs it does not seem
to me that I can necessarily infer it was the intention of the parties
that
each party should bear its own costs.  It would, of course, have been prudent
and would have removed at least part of the present
dispute if the parties at
the time of the making of those orders by consent had included in them some
indication as to whether the
costs of the proceedings to that point were to be
reserved or whether it was the intention of the parties that each should bear
its
or his own costs.
<P>

14   	Having made that observation, however, it does not seem to
me that those orders in any way pre-empt a decision of the Court
as to the
costs of the proceedings.
<P>

15   	The evidence satisfies me that it was the conduct of the
first defendant which made necessary the institution of the proceedings.
 The
first defendant had in his possession and under his control confidential
material and information of the first plaintiff.  He
did not at the outset
admit that he held that material.  It was necessary for the plaintiffs to
institute and pursue the proceedings
before the first defendant was prepared to
deliver up the material of the plaintiff and for the proceedings to continue
until both
defendants were prepared to consent to the relief of the nature set
forth in the orders of 12 and 14 August 1998.
<P>

16   	The evidence fully satisfies me that the defendants were
using (through the name of the second defendant and through a logo
used by the
second defendant and an application for an approved trademark being made by the
second defendant) material of similarity,
if not identicality, to that of the
trademark of the plaintiff.
<P>

17   	I am satisfied that the plaintiffs are entitled to their
costs of the proceedings from the inception of proceedings up to
and including
14 August 1998 and also including the implementation of the orders that were
made on 12 and 14 August 1998.  I am told
that the implementation had finally
been effected on about 28 October or 3 November 1998.
<P>

18   	After those consent orders had been made and implemented,
however, the proceedings remained on foot, as I have already observed,
only in
respect to the claim for damages of the plaintiffs, who have now chosen not to
pursue such a claim. It seems to me, in those
circumstances, that the
plaintiffs are not entitled to any costs after the implementation of the
consent orders, to which I have
already referred.
<P>

19   	There remains to be considered, however, the basis upon
which the costs order, to which the plaintiffs are entitled against
the
defendant, should be made.
<P>

20   	The plaintiffs, as I have already recorded, have submitted
that the costs order should be paid on the indemnity basis.  The
defendants
have submitted that any costs order made against them should be only on the
party and party basis.
<P>

21   	The mere fact that a party, either after a contested
hearing or as a result of consent orders, is unsuccessful in proceedings
does
not of itself attract an order for indemnity costs.  However, it was submitted
on behalf of the plaintiffs that in the instant
case the first defendant had no
legal right whatever to the property the subject of the plaintiffs claim; that
the first defendant
dishonestly asserted at the outset he did not have that
property and, further, that the resistance by the defendants to the claim
of
the plaintiffs until the orders were made by consent on 12 and 14 August 1998
was not grounded upon any bona fide claim of right.
 I am in agreement with
those submissions.  For that reason I propose to order that the costs to which
the plaintiffs are entitled
up to the date of the consent orders and their
implementation shall be on the indemnity basis.
<P>

22   	Since the plaintiffs have been largely successful in their
claim for costs it seems to me appropriate that they should also
be entitled to
receive their costs of the contested hearing conducted before me this morning.
However, the costs of today's hearing
should not be on the indemnity basis,
because the defendants were certainty entitled to argue against cost orders
being made against
them.
<P>

23   	The plaintiffs' costs of today will only be on the party
and party basis.
<P>

24   	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the defendants pay the costs of the plaintiffs proceedings up
to and including 14 August 1998 together with any
costs of the implementation
of orders made on 12 and 4 August 1998, such costs to be on the indemnity
basis, and the costs of the
hearing on 11 June 1999, such costs to be on the
party and party basis.
<P>

2.	The exhibits maybe returned.
<P>
