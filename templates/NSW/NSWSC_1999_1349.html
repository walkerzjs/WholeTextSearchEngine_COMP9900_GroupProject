<b>BARR J:</b>  This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed on the
respondent in the District Court.  The respondent pleaded guilty to charges
which may be summarised as follows:-<p>
	1.	Between 14 August and 7 September 1990 committing an act of indecency with
the complainant, she being under twelve years of age
and under his authority.
The complainant was the respondent's daughter, whom I will call M.<p>
	2.	In October 1990 assaulting and committing an act of indecency upon M, she
then being twelve years old and under his authority.<p>
	3.	In October 1990 having sexual intercourse with M without her consent and
knowing that she was not consenting, she then being
twelve years old and under
his authority.<p>
	4.	Between 21 September and 30 October 1990 unlawfully administering an
overpowering drug (Diazepam) to M with intent to enable
himself to commit an
indictable offence, namely indecent assault.<p>
	5.	In November 1991 assaulting and committing an act of indecency upon another
daughter of his, whom I will call L, in circumstances
of aggravation, they
being her age - twelve years old - and that she was under the respondent's
authority.<p>
	The sentence imposed on the fourth count was penal servitude for three years,
comprising a minimum term of eighteen months and an
additional term of eighteen
months.  The sentences on the other counts were all fixed terms of imprisonment
or penal servitude, varying
between ten and fourteen months in length.
Sentences on all counts were ordered to commence on 18 March 1996.  The
practical result
was a three year term.<p>
	The respondent and his wife, the mother of the complainants, lived with the
complainants and two other daughters.  The children
were often left in the care
of the respondent.  The facts giving rise to the first count were that one
night M was sleeping in the
respondent's bed (his wife was sleeping elsewhere
with a sick child) and woke to find that the respondent had placed her hand on
his penis and was using it to masturbate himself.  The complainant was afraid
and pretended to be asleep.  The charge was brought
under s 61E(2A) of the
Crimes Act and attracted a maximum penalty of four years' imprisonment.  The
second count related to an incident
that took place when the complainant and
the respondent were watching television.  The respondent touched the
complainant's breasts,
then opened her pyjama top and sucked them.  The
relevant section is s 61E(1A), carrying a maximum penalty of six years' penal
servitude.
 Immediately after that incident the respondent touched the
complainant's buttocks over the top of her pyjamas and then put his hand
inside
the front of her clothing and inserted his finger into her vagina, rubbing it
for some time.  He kissed the complainant as
he did so and told her that it
would be their secret.  The complainant was afraid and was in some pain.  That
was the third count.
 The relevant section is s 61D(1A) and the maximum penalty
twelve years' penal servitude.<p>
	The fourth count concerned an incident in which the respondent put Diazepam
(Valium) in the complainant's milk at bedtime.  The
complainant drank the milk
unwillingly, complaining about the taste.  She believed that she was being
given sleeping tablets.  Although
the fourth count concerned one occasion only,
this administration of the drug took place on a number of occasions, and the
investigating
police officer asked the respondent why he had given the
complainant the drug.  His reply was that she used to be very restless.
 He
gave it to her so that she would go to sleep "so I can go and play with her
breasts."  He was asked whether he did anything else
to her whilst she was
asleep and he replied that he had not.  There was no evidence to suggest that
that was an untruthful reply.
 This count was brought under s 38 of the Crimes
Act and attracted a maximum penalty of twenty-five years' penal servitude.<p>
	The respondent's child L was about two years younger than M.  One night while
the children's mother was at work the respondent entered
L's room, woke her,
put his hand inside her nightdress and played with her breasts.  The
complainant tried to resist, but the respondent
forced her to let him continue.
He threatened to "fix (her) up badly" if she told anyone what had happened.
The relevant section
was s 61M of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of
imprisonment for seven years.<p>
	The acts of the respondent have had an effect upon the complainants.  No
particular bodily or mental injury was pointed to, but
there was acceptable
psychiatric evidence to show that the prognosis for each was fair and dependent
on the results of therapy. 
Each complainant felt betrayed, and as his Honour
found, there was no possibility of a reconciliation between them and their
father.<p>
	The Crown attacked the length of the effective sentence imposed and the manner
of its division into minimum and additional terms.
 It was submitted that the
sentence did not reflect the objective seriousness of all the charges and that
the length of the sentences
themselves demonstrated error, particularly in the
face of the maximum sentence applicable to the fourth count.  It was submitted
that the events the subject of the charges took place over a substantial period
of time and involved two young girls under the control
of the respondent as
their father.  There was a gross breach of trust.  The criminality of the
respondent was exacerbated by the
premeditated and cunning way he had gone
about putting the Valium into M's bedtime drink.  It was further submitted that
the sentencing
judge was wrong in taking into account in mitigation the
respondent's feelings of shame following the breakdown of the marriage which
his conduct precipitated and wrongly attributing to the respondent a readiness
to make complete acknowledgment of his criminality.<p>
	It is not necessary in determining this appeal to decide whether the Crown was
correct in submitting that the fourth count was the
most serious.  The learned
sentencing judge attempted, appropriately, to devise a total effective sentence
which would give effect
to the total criminality of the respondent.  It seems
to me in view of that criminality that little assistance is to be had by
looking
at the maximum sentence applicable to any of the charges.  Taking the
fourth charge as an example, s 38 of the Crimes Act encompasses
the unlawful
application for administration to any person of chloroform, laudanum or other
stupefying or overpowering drug or thing
with intent to enable the accused or
another person to commit or with intent to assist another person to commit an
indictable offence.
 The range of drugs and things contemplated by the section
is very wide.  It includes highly dangerous substances capable of having
a
serious effect upon the intended victim, perhaps by occasioning bodily or
mental harm.  The intent to commit an indictable offence
or to facilitate the
commission of such an offence must be taken to relate to the whole range of
offences indictable in New South
Wales.  Those offences would include
everything from murder or other unlawful killing to the infliction of serious
injury or the
perpetration of other serious crimes.  The substance administered
in the present case was a sleeping agent commonly available on
prescription and
widely used in the community.  The intent with which it was administered was to
cause the child to sleep more soundly.
 It appears that that was its actual
effect, though it was not completely effective.  There is no evidence that the
drug itself caused
any harm.  The relevant intent was, as the respondent told
the police officer, to enable him to rub M's breasts as she slept.  Although
rubbing a young girl's breasts during her sleep is no light matter, and
constitutes an offence which may in an appropriate case be
punished by the
imposition of a period of imprisonment, the respondent's criminality in
administering the Diazepam does not seem
to me to rate very high in the range
of crimes contemplated by s 38.<p>
	Apart from the third count, the other offences committed on M comprised
indecently acting and touching.  They were not offences
of the worst kind
contemplated by the relevant sections of the Crimes Act.  The act of sexual
intercourse was a limited act of digital
penetration and as such fell into the
less serious offences contemplated by s 61D(1A).<p>
	The Crown submitted, especially in relation to the fourth count, that the
sentencing judge lost sight of the fact that the incidents
were not isolated.
I do not think that this submission is made out.  The sentencing judge's
remarks do not suggest that he regarded
the respondent's acts as isolated or
out of character.  What his Honour did find, correctly in my view, was that all
the offences
the subject of the first four counts were committed over a short
period of time.<p>
	The last count dealt with an entirely separate occurrence and was punishable
as such, but the relevant acts of the respondent were
not of the most serious
kinds capable of being dealt with under s 61M.<p>
	The respondent is fifty years old and for practical purposes entitled to be
treated as a first offender.  The sentencing judge found
that the respondent
himself had been badly affected by the break up of the family which he had
precipitated and that he was remorseful.
 The Crown levelled some criticism at
those findings, suggesting that his Honour had wrongly taken into account in
mitigation the
fact that the respondent was suffering from the direct effects
of his own criminality and that remorse was far from complete or genuine.
 I do
not think that his Honour intended to regard the respondent's suffering as a
mitigating feature as such, but was taking it
into account in his assessment of
contrition.  I think that his Honour was entitled to come to the view that the
respondent was genuinely
remorseful.<p>
	This Court must recognise the wide range of discretion resting in sentencing
courts and must not interfere with a sentence imposed
within the range of that
discretion, even though it might itself have imposed a different one.  It seems
to me that the effective
sentence of  three years, though lenient, was within
the discretion of the sentencing judge, and I would not disturb it.<p>
	However, the Crown also criticised the length of the additional term imposed
by the sentencing judge and submitted that it itself
demonstrated error.  When
a sentencing judge finds special circumstances he or she does so in a context
involving a decision that
there is something about the case that warrants a
longer than usual additional term by comparison with the minimum term.  "Usual"
in this case means nine months, for that is one-third of what would ordinarily
be the minimum term of a three year sentence.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5.</a>  In
finding that there were special circumstances in this case the sentencing judge
said:-<p>
<p>
	"In the sentence I propose to impose I am of the view that in the structure of
that sentence, when having regard to the period of
time to be served by way of
an additional term, the rehabilitation prospects of the prisoner would be
considerably assisted and indeed
enhanced by appropriate support and
counselling, in particular psychiatric counselling which I consider this man
needs."<p>
<p>
	There was evidence suggesting that the rehabilitation prospects of the
respondent might be assisted or enhanced by appropriate support
and
counselling, psychiatric or otherwise, but there was nothing in that evidence
suggesting that that support or counselling could
not commence before the
commencement of the additional term or continue after its expiry.  There was no
evidence as to how long such
counselling or support might take.  The reports of
two psychiatrists, Dr Roberts and Dr Carne were tendered.  Dr Roberts thought
that the respondent was suffering from depression arising from the
circumstances of his criminality, but not severe enough to be
regarded as a
psychiatric illness.  He speculated upon the possibility that the use of drugs
to inhibit his sex drive might be needed
in the future.  But Dr Roberts did not
recommend such treatment.  Dr Carne recorded two previous episodes of
depression, the first
in 1993 and 1994 and the second in 1995, for which the
respondent had been given anti-depressant treatment.  Dr Carne did not state
precisely what treatment had been administered.  The first of those treatments
lasted for six months.  Dr Carne had diagnosed the
respondent as suffering from
a reactive depression during 1996 and had prescribed a continuation of the
anti-depressant treatment.
 He was of the opinion that the respondent would
benefit from continuing psychiatric care.  Like Dr Roberts, Dr Carne referred
to
the possible need to prescribe drugs to inhibit the respondent's libido, but
left that measure as a mere possibility.  He recommended
regular psychiatric
follow up to enable the respondent's behaviour to be monitored and, if
necessary, his depression to be treated.<p>
	None of the evidence of Dr Roberts or Dr Carne demonstrated the need for an
additional term on parole greater than nine months.
 In my opinion his Honour
fell into error in finding that the circumstances were special, justifying an
increase in what would ordinarily
have been the maximum permissible additional
term.  His Honour had no discretion to select an additional term greater than
one-third
of the minimum term.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and
propose the following orders:-<p>
	In lieu of the sentence on the fourth count the respondent is sentenced to
penal servitude for a term of three years commencing
on 18 March 1996 and
expiring on 17 March 1999, comprising a minimum term of two years and three
months commencing on 18 March 1996
and expiring on 17 June 1998 and an
additional term of nine months.  Direct the release of the respondent on parole
on 17 June 1998.<p>
I would not disturb the sentences on the other counts.<p>
