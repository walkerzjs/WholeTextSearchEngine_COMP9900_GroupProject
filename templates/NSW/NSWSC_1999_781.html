<b>3230/99	WORLD PROJECTS CORPORATION   -v-   SYDNEY ORGANISING COMMITTEE FOR
THE OLYMPIC GAMES &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before me an application
made by the second defendant, the Honourable Michael Knight, pursuant to
liberty in that
regard reserved by Young J last Friday 23 July 1999, that the
second defendant have access to certain material, being an audio tape
which was
produced by the plaintiff, World Projects Corporation, pursuant to a notice to
produce dated 20 July 1999 which was answered
by the plaintiff before his
Honour.  The plaintiff opposes the application.  The first defendant, the
Sydney Organising Committee
for the Olympic Games supports the application by
the second defendant.  
<P>

2   	The proceedings were instituted by summons filed on 16 July
1999.  In support of that summons there was filed an affidavit
of William
Robert Lutt sworn 19 July 1999.  Paragraph 89 of that affidavit sets forth a
conversation between that deponent, the second
defendant and a third person.

<P>

3   	The tape which  is the subject of the present application
is, so I am informed, a tape of the conversation which appears in
paragraph 89
of the affidavit.  On its face the paragraph does not reveal that the entirety
of the conversation appears in that paragraph.

<P>

4   	It is not questioned that there is a discretion in the
Court as to whether access  should be allowed to material which is produced
to
the Court on subpoena or, as here, produced to a party in answer to a notice to
produce.
<P>

5   	The matter which I must decide is whether the discretion of
the Court should be exercised in favour of the second defendant
by allowing
access or in favour of the plaintiff by refusing access.
<P>

6   	It has been submitted by Counsel for the plaintiff that
access should be refused on a number of grounds. Firstly, that there
is what
has been described as a forensic advantage to the plaintiff in refusing such
access at this stage of the proceedings.  Further,
and this appears to me to be
another aspect of that first submission, that the plaintiff is entitled to see
the defences of the defendants,
and in particular the defence of the second
defendant, before access to the tape is allowed to him.  Although as I have
recorded,
the proceedings were instituted by summons, Young J on 23 July made
orders for pleadings, and in compliance with those orders the
plaintiff filed a
statement of claim on 27 July 1999.  No defence has yet been filed on behalf of
either of the defendants.
<P>

7   	I have been taken to a number of authorities relevant,
firstly, to the existence of the discretion in the Court to allow or
to refuse
access to the tape, and, secondly, relevant to the way in which that discretion
should be exercised. Those authorities
include the decision of the Court of
Appeal of New South Wales  in <i>National Employers Mutual General Association
Limited  -v-  Waind Hill </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NSWLR 372</a>, and in particular the judgment
of the President of the Court of Appeal, Moffitt P, commencing at 376 and
especially the passages
at 381 to 383; the decision of Clarke J (as his Honour
then was) in <i>Marcus  -v-  Provincial Insurance Co Limited</i> (unreported,
11 May 1993); and the decision of Wootten J in <i>Queensland Mine  -v-   Hudson
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20ACLC%2028660" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) ACLC  28.660.</a>
<P>

8   	It seems to me, in the instant case, that it is
particularly relevant to the exercise of the court's discretion that the tape
purports to be a tape of a conversation between the principal of the plaintiff
and the second defendant as well as one other person.
 Further, it seems to me
to be of considerable significance that this tape is not material which, for
example, could be used to cross-examine
the second defendant with an element of
surprise, since substantial parts of it are transcribed in the affidavit of Mr
Lutt to which
I have already referred.  
<P>

9   	Since the passage in paragraph 89 of Mr Lutt's affidavit
does not assert that it is the entire transcript of the tape, it seems
to me
that the second defendant is entitled to have access to the tape so that he can
satisfy himself firstly as to the accuracy
of what appears in the affidavit,
and secondly as to the completeness of what appears in the affidavit.  
<P>

10   	Accordingly, I consider that the interests of justice are
appropriately served by the Court exercising its discretion in favour
of the
second defendant and making an order that each defendant have access to the
tape.
<P>

11   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that access to a standard audio tape produced by the plaintiff to
the Court on 23 July 1999 be granted to each defendant
and to the respective
legal representatives of each defendant, such access to be exercised within the
Exhibits Office of the Court,
and that each defendant be permitted to make a
written transcript of such audio tape and to copy  such audio tape.
<P>

(2)	I order that the costs of today's hearing be the costs of the second
defendant in the proceedings.
<P>

(3)	I reserve liberty to apply to a Master on twenty-four hours notice.
<P>
