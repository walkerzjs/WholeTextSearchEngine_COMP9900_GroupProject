<b><u>30024/98 - DAVID JOHN KELLEHER v COMMISSIONER, DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIVE
SERVICES</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   This matter has a long history.  The plaintiff, David John
Kelleher, is serving a sentence for conspiracy to import
heroin.  He was
originally sentenced to life imprisonment on 21 September 1988.  On 18 July
1996 his sentence was redetermined and
a non-parole period of 13 years was
substituted.  He is due for release on parole on 20 September 2001.  The head
sentence of life
imprisonment remains.
<P>

2	The plaintiff sought permission from the Department of Corrective Services
(the Department) to have certain tattoos removed outside
the prison
environment.  In fact, he had one treatment which resulted in the partial
removal of some tattoos and it was anticipated
that he would have further
treatments.  However, after the first treatment, in a policy statement dated
October 1997 the Department
denied the right of inmates to private medical
treatment for removal of tattoos.  
<P>

3	At about the same time, the plaintiff sought permission to have plastic
surgery but that was refused.  There was no urgency in
either of these
procedures which could be performed on his release from prison.        
<P>

4	By way of Summons filed on 19 March 1998 the plaintiff seeks:
<P>

	"1(i)	A declaration that the prohibition of access by inmates to private
medical practitioners for tattoo removal is invalid.
<P>

	(ii)	An order quashing the decision of the defendant to prohibit the plaintiff
having his tattoos removed.
<P>

	(iii)	An order that the plaintiff be entitled to complete the tattoo removal
procedure.
<P>

	(iv)	Alternatively to (iii), an order that the matter be remitted to the
defendant.
<P>

	2(i)	A declaration that the prohibition of access by inmates to private
medical practitioners for cosmetic surgery which has no
medical need is
invalid.
<P>

	(ii)	An order quashing the decision of the defendant to prohibit the plaintiff
having the cosmetic surgery.
<P>

	(iii)	An order that the plaintiff be entitled to undergo the cosmetic
surgery.
<P>

	(iv)	Alternatively to (iii), an order that the matter be remitted to the
defendant.
<P>

	3(i)	An order quashing the decision of the defendant to deny the plaintiff a
Metropolitan Warrant.
<P>

	(ii)	An order that the plaintiff be entitled to a Metropolitan Warrant.
<P>

	(iii)	Alternatively to (ii), an order that the matter be remitted to the
defendant.
<P>

	4(i)	An order quashing the decision of the defendant to deny the plaintiff a
Complex Warrant.
<P>

	(ii)	An order that the plaintiff be entitled to a Complex Warrant.
<P>

	(iii)	Alternatively to (ii), an order that the matter be remitted to the
defendant.
<P>

	5.	Such further order as the Court sees fit.
<P>

	6.	Costs.
<P>

	<i>Outline:  The plaintiff seeks relief with respect to four decisions made by
the defendant.</i>
<P>

	1.	The plaintiff, after initially being given approval, paid moneys and
commenced a medical procedure to remove his tattoos.  Subsequently,
the
defendant decided to disallow the procedure.
<P>

	2.	The plaintiff, after initially being given approval, paid moneys and
commenced a medical procedure to have facial cosmetic surgery.
 Subsequently,
the defendant decided to disallow the procedure.
<P>

	3.	The plaintiff sought a Metropolitan Warrant and was strongly supported in
his application by, inter alia, the Activities Manager
for whom the plaintiff
would have been working.  This application was refused.
<P>

	4.	The plaintiff sought a Metropolitan Warrant and was again strongly
supported in his application.  This application was also
refused.
<P>

	<i>Grounds</i>
<P>

	1(i)	The prohibition of access by inmates to private medical practitioners for
the purpose of tattoo removal is ultra vires.
<P>

	(ii)	The prohibition was so unreasonable, given, inter alia, the legitimate
expectation of the plaintiff to be able to complete
the program, that the Court
should substitute the decision, or alternatively, quash and remit the
matter.
<P>

	2(i)	The prohibition of access by inmates to private medical practitioners for
the purpose of cosmetic surgery is ultra vires.
<P>

	(ii)	The prohibition was so unreasonable, given, inter alia, the legitimate
expectation of the plaintiff to be able to complete
the program, that the Court
should substitute the decision, or alternatively, quash and remit the
matter.
<P>

	3.	The decision of 19 February 1998 to deny the plaintiff a Metropolitan
Warrant was not made on the merits of the case.  It was
so unreasonable that no
reasonable person could have made it.  Irrelevant factors, inter alia the life
sentence status of the plaintiff,
were considered.  Relevant factors, inter
alia the exemplary record of the plaintiff were not properly considered.
<P>

	4.	The decision in March 1998 to deny the plaintiff a Complex Warrant was not
made on the merits of the case.  It was so unreasonable
that no reasonable
person could have made it."
<P>

5	This case raises the question of the power of this Court to review
administrative decisions of the Commissioner and/or the Department.

<P>

6	Whilst it is conceded that prisoners are not barred from seeking judicial
review of the decision making powers of correctional
authorities under relevant
legislation, such review, on the authorities, is clearly limited and very
confined.  The decisions on
this question, however, are not uniform.   
<P>

7	  The Courts in Australia have tended to interpret prison legislation so as
to give full scope to the power of correctional authorities
to carry out the
tasks of prison administration and management without undue influence from the
courts.  On some occasions the courts
have, however, been willing to provide
public law remedies and the right of a prisoner to seek judicial review is to
be determined
by reference to ordinary principles of statutory interpretation.

<P>

8	In <b>Flynn v King</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2079%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 79 CLR 1</a> Dixon J said (at 8):
<P>

	"It is pointed out in the case of <i>Horwitz v Connor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1908] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%206%20CLR%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 6 CLR 38</a> that
if prisoners could resort to legal remedies to enforce gaol regulations
responsibility for the discipline and control of prisoners
in gaol would be in
some measure transferred to the courts administering justice.  For if statutes
dealing with this subject matter
were construed as intending to confer fixed
legal rights upon prisoners it would result in applications to the courts by
prisoners
for legal remedies addressed either to the Crown or to the gaolers in
whose custody they remain.  Such a construction of the regulation-making
power
was plainly never intended by the legislature and should be avoided.  An
interpretation of the power to make prison regulations
and of the regulations
made thereunder as directed to discipline and administration and not to the
legal rights of prisoners is in
my opinion supported by the decision of this
Court in <i>Horwitz's</i> case".
<P>

9	The implication from a number of cases is that legislation and regulations
will only be construed as conferring rights on prisoners
where the language of
the statute is unambiguous.  In <b>Bromley v Dawes</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2010%20A%20Crim%20R%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 10 A Crim R 98</a> at
113 , White J of the South Australian Supreme Court, after referring to the
common law rule that a statutory authority empowered
to affect the rights of a
person is required to grant the person a hearing before exercising the power,
commented:
<P>

	"The presumption in favour of the citizen does not apply in favour of the
prisoner, as the cases show.  He is deprived of all of
a citizen's rights
except those which are preserved by the <i>Prisons Act</i> and regulations.
There must be clear words, apt words, which preserve those rights".
<P>

10	Consequently, where a statute is silent, prisoner rights to seek judicial
review have generally been given a restrictive interpretation.
<P>

11	The exercise of powers relating to prisoner classification and separation,
the transfer from one part of a prison to another,
transfers between prisons,
conditions on visits or access to certain conditions or facilities such as
education, recreation and supply
of condoms have all been characterised as
administrative and managerial in nature rather then punitive and judicial.
Consequently,
they have been held not to give rise to any right, interest or
legitimate expectation enforceable by judicial review in the ordinary
courts.
For example, see <b>Smith v Commissioner of Corrective Services</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1
NSWLR 317</a>;  <b>Walker v The Queen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2060%20A%20Crim%20R%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 60 A Crim R 463</a>;  <b>Gray v The
Queen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2045%20A%20Crim%20R%20364" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 45 A Crim R 364</a>;  and <b>Prisoners A-XXX inclusive</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2038%20NSWLR%20622" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935)
38 NSWLR 622.</a>  
<P>

12	In <b>Vezitis v McGeechan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%201%20NSWLR%20718" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 1 NSWLR 718</a> the treatment of a prisoner
not in accord with the prison routine and timetable contained within the
schedule to the prison regulations
was seen by Taylor J as not examinable by
the court.  He said (at 721):  
<P>

	"In my opinion the management of the gaol and the prisoners therein is given
to the Commissioner in very wide terms, and the manner
in which he carries out
his duties imposed by the section ought not to be examined by this Court unless
there a clear infringement
of the Act or regulations".
<P>

13	It has been said, however, that the approach of Courts has become more
interventionist and such decisions as <b>Vezitis</b> must be treated with
reserve.  In <b>McEvoy v Lobban</b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%202%20Qd%20R%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 2 QR 235</a> Macrossan CJ said (at
236):
<P>

	"The development of principle which may be found in the English cases
concerned with the power of the courts to review orders which
have been made by
prison authorities in respect of alleged offences or breaches of prison
disciplinary provisions (decisions culminating
in the recent case of <i>Leech v
Governor of Parkhurst</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] UKHL 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20AC%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] AC 533)</a> has involved an increased tendency on
the part of the courts to undertake judicial review".
<P>

14	See also Thomas J (at 242).
<P>

15	<b>Leech v Governor of Parkhurst</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1988/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] UKHL 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%20AC%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] AC 533</a> is authority for the
proposition that a convicted prisoner retains all civil rights which are not
taken away expressly or by necessary
implication and in particular his right of
unimpeded access to the courts. In <b>Leech</b>, the prisoner was convicted of
an offence and the Deputy Governor of the Prison ordered 28 days loss of
remission.  The Court held
that it had jurisdiction to entertain an application
for judicial review of a prison governor's disciplinary action, such action
being an essential characteristic of the rights of the subject, whatever his
status and however attenuated his rights and liabilities
might be in
consequence of some punitive or other process, and there was a right of
recourse to the courts unless some statute provided
otherwise.  There was no
provision in the <b>Prisons Act</b> 1952, in particular section 4(2), which
derogated from that principle in relation to the exercise of the disciplinary
powers conferred
upon a prison governor.  Lord Bridge of Harwich said (at
568):
<P>

	"I cannot help reflecting, in conclusion, that it would be a very remarkable
state of affairs if he were denied access to the courts
to challenge the
proceedings of an inferior judicial authority empowered, in effect, to deprive
him of liberty by extending the term
of his imprisonment".
<P>

	That situation is far removed from this case.  
<P>

16	In <b>Raymond v Honey</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20All%20ER%20756" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 All ER 756</a> Lord Bridge of Harwich said
(at 762):
<P>

	"I gratefully adopt the summary of the fats set out in the speech of my noble
and learned friend Lord Wilberforce and his statement
of the two basic
principles to be applied:  first, that any act done which is calculated to
obstruct or interfere with the due course
of justice, or the lawful process of
the courts, is a contempt of court;  second, that a convicted prisoner, in
spite of his imprisonment,
retains all civil rights which are not taken away
expressly or by necessary implication.  To these I would add a third principle,
equally basic, that a citizen's right to unimpeded access to the courts can
only be taken away by express enactment".
<P>

	Again, a very different situation to this one.
<P>

17	In <b>Felton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d93%29%2066%20A%20Crim%20R%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-93) 66 A Crim R 355</a> the facts were that the
Queensland Corrective Services Commission informed the applicant of its
decision not to grant him any remission
on his 10-year sentence as he had not
adequately addressed his sexually offending behaviour.  The Court held that
Regulation 27 clearly
established a legitimate expectation in a prisoner of
good conduct and industry to be granted remission in accordance with Regulation
21 and that the decision gave undue weight to irrelevant matters.  Mere failure
to complete the Sex Offender Treatment Programme
is not ordinarily regarded as
detrimental to the prisoner's entitlement to remission.
<P>

18	In New South Wales, correctional centres are governed by the <b>Correctional
Centres Act</b> (1952).  The plaintiff is a "convicted inmate" (s.4(1)(a) of
the Act).  The Commissioner is given wide powers under the legislation.
 The
Commissioner has, subject to the direction and control of the Minister, the
functions conferred or imposed on the Commissioner
by or under this or any
other Act (s.6(2)).  The Commissioner has the care, direction, control and
management of all correctional
centres and correctional complexes (s.6(3)).
The Commissioner may, either alone or in conjunction with other persons or
organisations,
make provision for the training, welfare and aftercare of
inmates (s.6(4)).  
<P>

19	The legislation is quite detailed in respect to the rights of prisoners.
For example exercise (s.12);  clothing (s.13);  diet
(s.14);  and separation of
inmates (s.15).  Importantly, on the question of medical treatment, s.16(1)
provides:
<P>

	"Every inmate shall be supplied with such medical attendance, treatment and
medicine as in the opinion of a medical officer is
necessary for the
preservation of the health of the inmate and of other inmates and of
correctional officers, and may be so supplied
with such medical attendance,
treatment and medicine as in the opinion of the Commissioner will alleviate or
remedy any congenital
or chronic condition which may be a hindrance to
rehabilitation".
<P>

20	In my view, this Section does not apply to the medical attention sought by
the plaintiff as it is does not go to alleviating
or remedying any congenital
or chronic condition which may be a hindrance to rehabilitation.
<P>

21	Imposed in the Commissioner is the absolute discretion under s.29 to permit
an inmate to be taken temporarily from any correctional
centre.  There are a
number of purposes specified (none of which apply to this case) and in addition
"or for any other purpose which
the Commissioner deems to be justified"
(s.29(1)). 
<P>

22	The Department permitted the plaintiff to attend one session of tattoo
removal for which he paid $1,200.  The removal was only
partially completed,
resulting, it appears, from the plaintiff, through no fault of his own,
arriving late for the appointment at
Bondi where the procedure was undertaken.
Having been given permission to have the tattoos removed, he expected to be
permitted to
undertake the further treatment.  
<P>

23	After that visit, the tattoo removal policy was altered in October 1997.
Annexure "A" to the affidavit of Mr. Murray McPherson,
Principal Legal Officer
of the Department of Corrective Services, sworn 27 November 1988, is a copy of
a letter from Mr. R.G. Woodham,
Assistant Commissioner Operations, to all
Regional Commanders, Governors, D/S&amp;I and OIC Courts which is in the
following terms:
<P>

	"<b>Inmates Access to Private Medical Practitioners</b>
<P>

	Inmates will no longer be permitted to use the services of private medical
practitioners of their choice to have tattoos removed
or for any other form of
cosmetic surgery.
<P>

	This does not prevent inmates having cosmetic surgery, other than for the
removal of tattoos, when the Corrections Health Service
has determined a
medical need for this type of surgery".
<P>

24	There is no evidence as to why there was this sudden change of policy,
particularly after the plaintiff had been granted permission
to undergo the
procedures.  
<P>

25	If permission was refused initially to have the tattoos removed,
particularly as it required the plaintiff to leave the prison
confines under
escort (even though the plaintiff was paying for the costs of escort) the
decision would have been within the Commissioner's
and/or the Department's
absolute discretion, and, in my view, would not be open to review by this
Court.  As I have stated earlier,
there was certainly no urgency for this
procedure which could just as easily be carried out on his release from prison.

<P>

26	However, permission was granted to have the procedures carried out on the
understanding that a number of procedures would be
required.  No explanation
has been given for this policy decision.  It probably arose out of the
plaintiff's application.  The plaintiff
has been given no explanation.  The
question in those circumstances is does this Court have jurisdiction to
intervene if it were
minded to do so?
<P>

27	The plaintiff argues, firstly, that the decision is ultra vires.  I do not
accept that submission.  The Commissioner has a discretion
to allow a prisoner
to leave a prison pursuant to s.29.  Thus, by acting to prevent a prisoner
leaving a prison is not acting ultra
vires. 
<P>

28	It is submitted, however, that the plaintiff had a legitimate expectation
that he would be able to have the tattoo removal completed,
particularly as he
was permitted one treatment in what was envisaged as a course of treatment.  It
is submitted that there may be
a legitimate expectation in a person that may
give rise to him being entitled to procedural fairness in the treatment of his
case.
 This duty, of course, depends on the circumstances of each case but its
existence is determined by reference to legal principle.
 See <b>Attorney
General (NSW) v Quin</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 1</a> per Mason CJ at 20.  Mason CJ said
(at 20):
<P>

	"So, a legitimate expectation may be created by the giving of assurances, the
existence of a regular practice, the consequences
of denial of the benefit to
which the expectation relates or the satisfaction of statutory conditions.  The
list is not exhaustive,
but provides indications of the kinds of factors which
a court will take into account in deciding whether or not an expectation is
legitimate.  
<P>

	...  it is still necessary to identify a relevant legitimate expectation, and
that legitimate expectation may consist of an expectation
of a procedural
right, advantage or opportunity.  ...
<P>

	Perhaps in pursuit of clarity of expression, courts have referred to a
legitimate expectation that some benefit will not be denied
or taken away
without an opportunity of being heard".
<P>

29	See also <b>Kioa v West</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR 550</a> per Mason J (as he then was)
at 582.
<P>

30	I am satisfied that there was a legitimate expectation that the plaintiff
would not be denied further visits in the light of
the permission previously
granted, including the fact that he expended $1,200 on the partially completed
treatment.  
<P>

31	Despite that expectation, this was an administrative decision of the
Commissioner and/or the Department which involves the exercise
of the
discretion under s.29 of the Act for the plaintiff to be temporarily absent
from the prison establishment.  Questions of security
are obviously involved in
such an exercise, particularly with a prisoner serving a life sentence.  
<P>

32	The defendant's submissions are not particularly helpful.  The only
submission made is that pursuant to s.29 the defendant can
decide not to
exercise his discretion when he considers that a particular purpose is not
justified.  The necessary power has been
committed to him by the legislature
under s.29.  That matter is self-evident.  
<P>

33	It is further submitted on behalf of the defendant that para. 13 of the
plaintiff's submissions shows that the decision which
the plaintiff seeks to
challenge is a general policy statement regarding inmates' access to private
medical practitioners made in
October 1997.  The plaintiff has produced no
evidence of any individual decision taken in respect of him since the policy
was introduced,
although para. 38 of the plaintiff's submissions is worded in
terms which assume that has occurred.  It is reasonable to assume the
policy
refers to the plaintiff, or otherwise he undoubtedly would have been told to
the contrary.  
<P>

34	Reliance is placed on the decision of <b>Prisoners A-XX v NSW</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2075%20A%20Crim%20R%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 75
A Crim R 205</a>, a decision of Dunford J, where he said in respect of the use of
condoms in correctional centres (at 211):
<P>

	"... policy decisions of the Commissioner and/or the Department made with the
concurrence of the Minister relating to the administration
of prisons ... are
not reviewable by the Courts within the <i>Wednesbury</i> principles or
otherwise".
<P>

35	It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff's submissions
advert to paras. 23 and 25 of that decision, apparently
with a view to
distinguishing that decision by claiming that the policy decision in the
present case was not made with the concurrence
of the Minister.  The plaintiff
submits that from a reading of that decision his Honour inferred the existence
of Ministerial concurrence
from the language of the then <b>Prisons Act</b>
1952, now the <b>Correctional Centres Act</b> 1952 (S.6).
<P>

36	I have carefully examined Dunford J's Judgment and I cannot agree with the
submission made on behalf of the defendant.  His Honour
said (at 210):
<P>

	"The power to direct and manage prisons conferred on the Commissioner by s.6
is subject to the direction and control of the Minister
(s.6(2)) who in turn is
a member of the Cabinet and as such is answerable to Parliament, and through
Parliament to the electorate.
 Such is the nature of our democratic process
that the determination of government policy often involves political
considerations,
and if the courts were to assume the power to review decisions
of governmental policy, political power would pass from the Parliament
and the
electorate to the courts".
<P>

37	More importantly, his Honour went on to say (at 210):
<P>

	"Section 50(1) of the <i>Prisons Act</i>, which gives the Governor power to
make regulations, was amended by the <i>Prisons (Amendment) Act</i> 1988 (NSW),
No. 46, s.3 and Sch.2, par (20)(e) which inserted a new par (j3) in the
subsection, namely a power to make regulations
relating to the distribution and
use of condoms;  but s.2 of that Act provided that its various provisions
should commence on day
or days to be appointed by proclamation, ie by the
Governor with the advice of the Executive Council:  <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</i>
1987</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.23(2)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">14</a>;  and this particular amendment has not yet been
proclaimed.  The power to proclaim the commencement of the relevant amendments
was
not conferred on the courts, and it is not for the courts to, in effect,
usurp such power".
<P>

38	If that was the case, it is quite obvious that those regulations could not
be introduced, except by the responsible Minister.
 I am of the view that
Dunford J concluded in those circumstances that the regulation proposed had the
concurrence of the Minister.
 That is not the situation in the present case.
The only material before me is contained in para. 3 of the affidavit of Mr.
McPherson
which is in the following terms:
<P>

	"I am informed and believe that it is Departmental practice for a policy to be
sent to the Commissioner for the Commissioner's
approval prior to its
issue".
<P>

39	That does not assume that it had the specific concurrence of the Minister.
I do not accept the submission that in those circumstances
I can imply the
Minister's concurrence.  Despite the expectation of the plaintiff that he would
be able to continue the tattoo treatment,
and despite the visits of the
plaintiff to have that performed, I have come to the conclusion that it is not
open to this Court to
review the exercise of the Commissioner and/or the
Department's discretion  pursuant to s.29 of the Act to allow an inmate to
leave
an institution.  These are matters peculiarly vested in the Commissioner
and/or the Department.
<P>

40	Likewise, this Court does not have the jurisdiction to interfere with the
decision not to permit absence from the institution
for plastic surgery.

<P>

41	This was a novel request.  It was not for the purpose of "medical attention"
(s.16) and there was no immediate need for such
surgery which could be
undertaken on the plaintiff's release from prison.  
<P>

42	These matters are administrative decisions within the discretion of the
Commissioner and/or the Department.  There is nothing
in the material before me
to indicate that there was a failure to properly exercise the discretion
imposed in the Commissioner. 
In those circumstances this Court does not have
the power to intervene.  
<P>

43	In relation to the second part of the application, namely the s.20 warrants,
it is submitted that the decision was unreasonable
having regard to a proper
approach to the plaintiff's rehabilitation.
<P>

44	The plaintiff's management is under the auspices of the Serious Offenders
Review Council (s.61).  The Council consists of eight
members, six appointed by
the Governor, and two official members, being officers of the Department of
Corrective Services nominated
by the Commissioner.  Of the members appointed by
the Governor, three are to be judicially qualified persons and three are to be
community members (not being officers of the Department of Corrective Services)
appointed to represent the community or any significant
portion of the
community.
<P>

45	The Council's functions are set out in s.62 as follows:
<P>

	"(a)  	to provide advice and make recommendations to the Commissioner with
respect to the following:
<P>

	*	the security classification of serious offenders,
<P>

	*	the placement of serious offenders,
<P>

	*	developmental programs provided for serious offenders".
<P>

46	It should be pointed out that the plaintiff comes within the definition of a
serious offender.  
<P>

47	Amongst others, the Council's functions are:
<P>

	"(b) 	to provide reports and advice to the Parole Board concerning the release
on parole of serious offenders,
<P>

	(e)	to provide reports and advice to the Minister,
<P>

	(g)	to perform such other functions as may be prescribed by the regulations in
relation to the management of serious offenders
and other inmates."
<P>

48	The plaintiff made application to the Serious Offenders Review Council on 4
August 1997 (page 61, Exhibit A) which noted that
the Council had recommended a
reduction of his classification to C2 "as per your approved pathway".  He
sought the position of Activities
Clerk.  That was supported by a Mr. Cusack, a
senior prison officer Activities Manager.  His approval was sent to Mr. B.
Russell,
the Governor ITC, and Mr. G. Delprado, Area Manager B.  Mr. Russell
noted, "I believe this is an appropriate progression for inmate
Kelleher.  I
recommend a Section 20 Metropolitan Warrant which I can approve.  However,
given the SORC status seek your final advice".
 Mr. Delprado also recommended
that this was appropriate for his programme pathway.  A Mr. Stefan Tkautz,
A/Manager of Industries,
also urged that this job be given to the plaintiff.
<P>

49	At its meeting on 24 October 1997, the Council noted the application for a
s.20 Metropolitan Warrant.  However, in view of the
length of sentence which
remained to be served and the programme pathway, it deferred making a
recommendation until he was interviewed
by an Assessment Committee.  This took
place on 19 November 1997.  The Minutes of the meeting on 24 October 1997
state:
<P>

	"Kelleher denies that he will be the subject of any media attention.  The
Assessment Committee recommends that Kelleher remain
at the Industrial Training
Centre with his current C2 classification in accordance with his management
plan.  Also, the Committee
recommends the Council consider Kelleher's request
for a s.20 Order which is supported by the Activities Officer.  For the
Council's
consideration and recommendation".
<P>

50	On 22 December 1997 the following recommendation was made:
<P>

	"The Council noted that Kelleher's Federal non-parole period expires on 19
September 2001.  In the circumstances and having regard
to the offence
committed and the length of time served, the Council is of the opinion that
Kelleher requires a proper structured
program to include meaningful work (other
than being employed as a gaol sweeper or as an assistant to the Activities
Officer at the
ITC) in order to re-integrate into the community.    
<P>

	Accordingly, the Council does not support the issuing of an order pursuant to
s.20 of the Correctional Centres Act 1952, at this
time.
<P>

	The Council asks the Case Management Team at the ITC to develop an appropriate
pre-release program and submit by Friday, 30 January
1998".
<P>

51	Pursuant to that decision, a letter was written by the Council to the
plaintiff on 24 December 1997.  The plaintiff replied to
that letter setting
out reasons why that decision should be reversed.  
<P>

52	On 28 January 1998 a meeting was held to discuss a "Pre-Release Program" at
which the plaintiff was present.  The members of
the Case Management Team
supported the programme. 
<P>

53	On 19 February 1998 the Council wrote to the plaintiff and stated:
<P>

	"The Council does not recommend the issuing of a s.20 Metropolitan Warrant
because of the gravity and nature of your offence which
incurred an original
sentence of life".
<P>

54	It is submitted that that action was unreasonable.  
<P>

55	It is submitted by the defendant that Ground 3 of the Summons asserts, but
does not establish, the existence of an error of law
in the Council's decision.
The Council advised the plaintiff why it had decided not to make a
recommendation;  it did not advise
him that it had not taken into account such
matters as his record or his numerous trouble-free visits to medical
practitioners and
annexure "OO" to the plaintiff's affidavit is not evidence to
that effect.  
<P>

56	It is submitted that Ground 3 of the Summons and para. 41 of the plaintiff's
submissions make reference to relevant and irrelevant
considerations.  Para. 41
incorrectly claims that the Council adverted to "the alleged high profile
status of the plaintiff".  The
matter which the Council actually did cite in
annexure "OO" is not an irrelevant consideration.  The nature of the crime and
the
recommendations of the sentencing court are considerations which the
Council is required to take into account under s.62(3)(b) and
(c) of the
<b>Correctional Centres Act</b> 1952.  
<P>

57	It is submitted that the weight which a decision-maker allocates to a
particular relevant consideration is a matter for the decision-maker
and not
for the Court on a judicial review unless the decision-maker has given
excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great
importance.  The nature of
the plaintiff's crime and the recommendation of the sentencing court could not,
in the defendant's submission,
be characterised as relevant factors of no great
importance.
<P>

58	I should point out that I have no information as to the facts of the crime.
Suffice it to say that it was obviously a very serious
crime calling for a life
sentence.
<P>

59	There is no evidence that this decision resulted from an abuse of power.
See <b>Attorney General v Quin</b> per Brennan J at 36.  It is not so
unreasonable that no reasonable repository of the power could have taken the
impugned decision
or action.  
<P>

60	It is submitted that the plaintiff's submissions invite the Court to review
the Council's decision on the merits but do not establish
that the decision
falls within the restricted category which Brennan J identified.
<P>

61	The defendant routinely refers all warrant applications regarding serious
offenders to the Council for a recommendation.  The
defendant, it is submitted,
is not aware of any decision made by the Council in March 1998 in respect of a
complex warrant relating
to the plaintiff.  The Council met in February 1998
and in November 1998.  The March 1998 application set out in annexure "PP" to
the plaintiff's affidavit was referred to the Council but was not the subject
of any recommendation made by the Council prior to
the date on which the
Summons was filed.
<P>

62	The situation is that this Court is asked to interfere and overrule the
decision of an expert body which was set up to determine
programme pathways for
serious offenders.  It is fully conversant with the background of the offender
and his problems and it has
made decisions with respect to him being in a
position to rehabilitate himself when he is released from gaol. 
<P>

63	I do not find that this Court has any jurisdiction to intervene and I do not
propose to do so.  
<P>

64	So far as is necessary, I make a similar finding in relation to the issue of
the Complex Warrant.
<P>

65	I therefore dismiss the plaintiff's Summons.
<P>
