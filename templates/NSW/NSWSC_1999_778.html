<P>

<b>3123/98	TERESA MAREE BATES   -v-   VERILIE ESMA WELLS &amp; ANOR   -
ESTATE OF DAVID JOHN WELLS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER: </b>These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.  By summons filed 13 July 1998, the plaintiff Teresa
Maree Bates, claims an order for provision for her maintenance, education and
advancement in life out of the estate of her late father, David John Wells (to
whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

2   	The deceased died on 6 May 1998.  He left a will dated 11
June 1998, probate whereof was on 10 July 1998 granted to Verilie
Esma Wells
and Darren James Wells, the executors named in such will (who are the
defendants to the present proceedings).
<P>

3   	The deceased had been married twice. Of his first marriage
to Sandra (now Mrs Daniels), on 6 March 1995 were born two children.
 They were
Darren James, who was born on 11 November 1967 and who is now aged thirty-one
(he is the second defendant), and Teresa
Maree, who was born on 15 June 1971
and who is presently aged twenty-eight (she is the plaintiff).
<P>

4   	In August 1984 the deceased and his first wife separated,
and they divorced in December of the following year.  At the time
of the
separation, the plaintiff was aged thirteen. She was fourteen and a half at the
time of her parents' divorce.  When the parents
separated, an informal
arrangement appears to have been made between themselves and their two
children, that each of the children
would spend alternate weeks with each
parent, so that at any one time one parent and one child would be together.
However, after
a year or so, that arrangement appears to have altered somewhat,
and the arrangement ultimately became that the plaintiff resided
full time with
her mother whilst Darren resided full time with his father.
<P>

5   	There was evidence of decreasing contact between the
plaintiff and the deceased.  Indeed, by the time she had reached her late
teens
and early twenties, the contact was slight and was almost invariably initiated
by the plaintiff herself.  There was also evidence
that the deceased had paid
little by way of maintenance for the plaintiff. It would appear that a trust
account had been established
by the deceased into which some payments were
made, totalling a little over $1000, but that when the plaintiff was aged only
about
thirteen or fourteen, the deceased required her to sign a document which
enabled that amount to be withdrawn.  Apparently the deceased
used that money
for his own benefit rather than for the benefit of the plaintiff.
<P>

6   	In the meantime the deceased had married his second wife,
Verilie Esma, who is the first defendant, on 20 December 1986.  There
were no
children born of that union.  Mrs Verilie Wells had herself previously been
married and had children of her own.  Nevertheless,
the relationship between
Darren and his father and his father's new wife continued to be a close and
affectionate one.  After an
incident at the time when Darren wed in October
1993, there was virtually no further contact between the plaintiff and her
father
until the death of the deceased some four and a half years later.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff married in 1995. She did not invite her
father to her wedding.  She and her husband now have a son, William,
who was
born on 21 June 1999.  
<P>

8   	Evidence was placed before the Court concerning the present
financial and material circumstances of the plaintiff and her husband.
 The
plaintiff, who until about eighteen months ago had various employments,
including that of dental nurse, although she has no
formal qualifications in
that regard, is now a full-time wife and mother.  She and her husband propose
to have more children, and
it is unlikely that the plaintiff will re-enter the
work force for some years.  As a consequence the plaintiff has received no
income
in the period of past eighteen months.  
<P>

9   	The plaintiff's husband is employed by Telstra.  Until
January of this year, he was employed as a level 3 plant operator and
his net
earnings (which include a basic salary and payment of overtime) for the year
ended 30 June 1998 totalled $36,599.  In January
of this year he was promoted
to level 4 communication officer.  His salary has increased but he is now no
longer entitled to any
overtime.  In consequence, his net income will now be
about $30,000, a reduction of about $6600 from his net income for the previous
financial year.
<P>

10   	The plaintiff and her husband own their residence, which
consists of a house property at 12 Rama Road, Valentine.  That house
property,
of which they are joint tenants, has an estimated value of $250,000.  It is
however subject to a mortgage, upon which there
is presently outstanding an
amount of $138,000.  They own a 1989 Ford Telstra motor vehicle, having a
present value of $5000; a boat,
with a value of about $1200; the contents and
furnishings of their house; and an amount invested in an account with the
Newcastle
Permanent Building Society of $2387.  Details concerning the living
expenses of the plaintiff and her husband over the past twelve
months total
$37,601. It will be appreciated that that figure is about the amount of the net
income of the plaintiff's husband before
he received his promotion in January
of this year and is indeed $7600 more than his present net annual income.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff received no benefit under the terms of her
father's will.  By that will, the deceased gave to his widow, the
first
defendant, a life interest in the residence at 19 Maryot Street, Belmont, which
was their matrimonial home at the time of his
death, with remainder to his son
Darren, and the residue of his estate equally between his widow and Darren.
<P>

12   	The net distributable estate is valued at about $864,000.
That valuation takes into account the costs of the defendant in
the present
proceedings, in an estimated amount of $35,000, and also the costs of the
plaintiff of the present proceedings, also
in an amount estimated to be about
$35,000.  
<P>

13   	The house property at 19 Maryot Street has an ascribed
value of $320,000.   The other piece of real estate which was owned
by the
deceased at the time of his death was a house property at 18 Fellows Street,
Merewether. That property has now been sold,
and the estate holds the net
proceeds of sale in an amount of almost $164,000.  Other assets in the estate
consists of money and
shares totalling almost $450,000.
<P>

14   	There is a further asset which is a shareholding of the
mother of the deceased, the late Daisy Joan Wells. She died on 2 April
1996.
By her will, she gave to her grandson Darren, son of her only child, the
deceased, the dividends upon certain her shares for
his life, and the will
continued "After his death I give any undistributed dividends and shares to my
son, the said David John Wells
absolutely."
<P>

15   	It would appear that these shares have a value of over
$400,000.  The only significance of the testamentary provisions of
the mother
of the deceased to the present proceedings is that it would appear that, in
consequence of the death of the deceased,
there will upon the ultimate death of
Darren be a partial intestacy in the estate of the late Daisy Joan Wells which
will result
eventually in the plaintiff (being at that stage a surviving
grandchild of the late Daisy Joan Wells), receiving a half interest
in that
shareholding, the other half interest going to the estate of Darren.  However
any practical benefit to the plaintiff resulting
from that eventual interest in
part of her grandmother's estate is likely not to come to her for many years
into the future. The
Court, in deciding the plaintiff's claim, must proceed by
looking to the financial and material circumstances of the plaintiff at
the
present time.
<P>

16   	Where, as here, there has been an estrangement between a
testator and a child of that testator, it is very difficult for anyone
else, be
it a court or any other person, to make a judgment about who was ultimately
responsible for that estrangement. Frequently
the responsibility is that of
each of the parties who are estranged.  
<P>

17   	Here, the plaintiff herself has however required and
undergone treatment for emotional problems which in part have resulted
from her
estrangement from her father and in part have also stemmed from disabilities in
her relationship with her own mother and
with her mother-in-law and, at the
time while she was in employment, difficulties with a fellow worker.  
<P>

18   	The plaintiff as a child of the deceased is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
section 3(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  As such she has the standing
to bring the present proceedings. It will be appreciated that the first
defendant as the widow of
the deceased is also an eligible person, being such
within paragraph (a) of that definition, and Darren, as a son of the deceased,
is also an eligible person, coming within paragraph (b) of the definition.
<P>

19   	The plaintiff has placed before the Court a list of what
has been described by her as her needs, especially in relation to
the residence
and household requirements for herself, her husband and her young son.  That
list has however been by the defendant
characterised as not a list of needs but
more in the nature of a wish list.  
<P>

20   	The cost of the various additions and improvements to the
house property which the plaintiff desires should be acquired or
effected total
$158,000.  They include the extension of the house by construction of what was
described as a rumpus room and construction
of a swimming pool and the
acquisition of air conditioning for the house.  However, it would appear that
the plaintiff and her husband
and child live in what can only be described as a
most commodious residence, albeit at present somewhat sparsely furnished.
<P>

21   	They appear to have a need for additional furniture and
furnishings, and for such items as curtains and blinds. Since the
plaintiff is
at home with her infant son whilst her husband is at work, a second motor
vehicle could probably be described as a need.
 But certainly I do not consider
that the totality of the items costing $158,000 could all be described as needs
without which the
plaintiff and her husband could not live at an acceptable
standard.
<P>

22   	In addition, the plaintiff commendably desires that
private health insurance for her husband her son be obtained. She also
expressed a desire for some substantial reduction, or even a total discharge of
the amount presently owing under the mortgage on
the house property, being
$138,000.
<P>

23   	In approaching the claim of the plaintiff, it is necessary
for the Court to consider any competing claims upon the testamentary
bounty of
the deceased.  In the instant case, the competing claims are those of the two
defendants, being the widow and the son of
the deceased.  The former wife of
the deceased is also an eligible person under paragraph (c) of the definition,
but she has made
no claim against the estate of her former husband.
<P>

24   	Evidence has been placed before the Court concerning the
financial circumstances of Mrs Verilie Wells, widow of the deceased.
 She has
continued to live in the house property which was her matrimonial home during
the lifetime of the deceased.  The Court would
not contemplate in any way
interfering with that entitlement.  In addition, quite apart from the other
benefits to which she is entitled
as recipient of a half share in the residue
of the deceased, Mrs Verilie Wells has substantial assets of her own. Those
assets include
two residential units at Belmont (having an estimated total
value of $200,000) and various moneys invested (which give to her an
income of
about $620 a week).  She also has an 1985 model Toyota motor vehicle, valued at
about $5000.  
<P>

25   	No precise evidence has been placed before the Court by
Darren James Well, the other beneficiary named in the will of the
deceased,
concerning his financial and material circumstances.   He is married and has
three young children.  He is in employment.
 He has received considerable
benefits as a result of the testamentary provisions of his grandfather,
Alexander Clifford Wells, and
his grandmother, Daisy Joan Wells.  
<P>

26   	The only significance of the financial and material
circumstances of each of the defendants is that these circumstances might
have
the effect of reducing, or even extinguishing, any order for provision an
entitlement to which the plaintiff might otherwise
have established
<P>

27   	In the instant case, the circumstances of the two named
beneficiaries, who it must be emphasised are the chosen objects of
the
testamentary beneficence of the deceased, are such that they will not reduce,
let alone extinguish, any order for provision which
the plaintiff might
otherwise have established.
<P>

28   	It seems to me that it is appropriate that the plaintiff
should receive an order for provision out of the estate of her late
father.
That order should be in an amount which will enable her to effect improvements
by way of furniture and furnishings for her
residence, but will not necessarily
allow her to indulge in what one might describe as additions in the nature of
luxuries. I do
not consider that a swimming pool could by any means be regarded
as a necessary addition to the residence. The amount should also
enable the
plaintiff to acquire a second motor vehicle and should enable the plaintiff and
her husband and child all to have private
health insurance.  Further, it should
enable her to have some funds available to meet contingencies, or to enable her
to effect some
improvements in her lifestyle, or, if she so desires, to enable
her to reduce the amount owing upon the housing loan secured by mortgage.
<P>

29   	In all the circumstances, it is my conclusion that the
plaintiff should receive out of the estate of the deceased, a legacy
in the sum
of $100,000, and I propose so to order.  A legacy in that amount will not in
the circumstances of this case have a detrimental
effect upon the situation of
either of the two defendants.
<P>

30   	The orders which I make are as follows:
<P>

1.	I order that the plaintiff receive out of the estate of the late David John
Wells ("the deceased") a legacy in sum of $100,000,
such legacy not to bear
interest if paid on or before 26 August 1999, and if not so paid to bear
interest at Supreme Court rates.
<P>

2.	I order the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and the
costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be paid
out of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
