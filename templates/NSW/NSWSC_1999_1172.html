<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Application for inspection of defendant's discovered documents -
the post-publication Quail diaries)</b>
<P>

1   	In my judgment  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/1110.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 1110</a>; DLJT: 56 of 17 November
1999 I dealt with the "<i>first category</i>" of documents being the
"<i>pre-publication"</i> diaries of Mr Quail.
<P>

2   	Further to paragraph 25 of my judgment I have now inspected
the three diaries.  
<P>

3   	At the outset it can be stated the diaries are in the form
of appointment books.  Further, insofar as there has been masked
entries in
those diaries, I accept that those entries are personal, private and irrelevant
and need not be the subject of inspection
by the plaintiff.  The fact that the
documents constituted by the diaries contain such entries, of course, indicates
that those documents
are essentially private documents of Mr Quail and as
"<i>documents</i>" it cannot be said that they came into existence or were made
after the proceedings were commenced for the purposes set out in paragraph
8 of
the affidavit of discovery.  That paragraph is set out in paragraph 6 of my
earlier judgment and sub-paragraph (a) asserts privilege
founded upon a
"<i>sole purpose</i>" of the documents coming into existence as the obtaining
for and furnishing to the defendant's solicitors "<i>evidence and
information</i>" as to the evidence which will be obtained and otherwise for
the use of the solicitors to enable them to conduct the action, and
"<i>otherwise to advise the defendant".</i>  Viewing the documents as a whole
as Mr Quail's private diaries, that description is not apt.  
<P>

4   	The focus therefore is to be upon the <i>"exposed</i>"
entries.  In a memorandum provided to me by the solicitors for the defendant
setting out various dates from the 1996, 1997 and 1998
diaries it is said that
the entries which have been masked (if any), contain Mr Quail's personal
material relating to his business
or private affairs.  This I accept.  The
entries which remain unmasked relate, it is said, "<i>to inquiries made on
behalf of the defendant for the purposes of proceedings".</i>
<P>

5   	The unmasked material fairly can be described as containing
entries which on their face are "<i>irrelevant</i>", "<i>private</i>" and names
including that of Mr Angus solicitor for the defendant, "<i>Deidre</i>" and
other "<i>names</i>" with, from time to time, a reference to "<i>lunch</i>" and
a location, or a telephone number.  Otherwise the exposed material, certainly
as far as I am concerned, on its face, is to a
great extent incomprehensible.

<P>

6   	In paragraph 18 of my earlier judgment I set out the
submissions for the plaintiff and in paragraphs 21 and 22 those for the
defendant.  I am persuaded by the submissions for the plaintiff.  The mere
entry does not, in my view, constitute a communication
nor does the document
"<i>the diary</i>" constitute a confidential document on the material available
to me.  Insofar as it was contended for the defendant that the entries
would
constitute "<i>information"</i> that could properly be regarded as
<i>"confidential"</i>, I find difficulty in accepting that submission.  The
information, if it be information at all, is constituted by the physical entry
on the relevant page; that in all the circumstances is not sufficient to make
it "<i>confidential</i>".  In any event, "<i>confidential</i>" information is
directed to the substance of the contents of a "<i>confidential</i>" document
which I do not find these diaries each to be or to the content of a
"<i>communication</i>" which I do not find any entry to be.  
<P>

7   	The plaintiff is entitled to inspect the documents falling
into the second category.  That may well be best effected by photocopies
being
produced omitting the masked portions.  
<P>

8   	It was indicated for the defendant that in the event of the
plaintiff succeeding, it would wish to argue that inspection should
not be
permitted on discretionary grounds.  The formal orders will reflect that
situation.
<P>

9   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The application for an inspection order in respect of the post-publication
diaries of Greg Quail is allowed.
<P>

2.	I stay order 1, until further order to be made upon the determination of any
application that inspection should ultimately be
refused on discretionary
grounds.
<P>

3.	Costs reserved.
<P>

4.	Exhibit A is returned to the plaintiff.
<P>

5.	The three diaries are returned to the defendant.
