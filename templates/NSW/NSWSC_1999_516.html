MASTER MACREADY
<P>

Wednesday 2 June 1999
<P>

<b>2483/98 ADAM WADE ASHBY BROWN v VILLAGE ROADSHOW CORPORATION LIMITED AND
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  This is the hearing of a Notice of Motion filed by
the first, second, third, fifth, sixth and eight defendants on 4 February 1999.
It seeks that the Amended Summons and Amended Statement of claim be struck out
in whole or in part.  The applicants contend that
no cause of action is
disclosed.  
<P>

2	The matter has some history in respect of an earlier Statement of Claim.
However, the one with which I am concerned is an Amended
Statement of Claim
which was filed on 20 October 1998.  That Statement of Claim is drafted by the
plaintiff who appears in person
and it sets out in reasonable detail in an
acceptable form the basis of the claim which the plaintiff makes.  The claim
made falls
into three particular areas.
<P>

3	The first is a copyright claim, the second is a trademark claim based upon a
trade mark of which the plaintiff is the registered
proprietor and the third
claim is a claim for breach of confidential information.  Particulars have been
supplied in respect of some
matters in the Statement of Claim and it will be
useful to refer to those shortly.  The claim arises out of the work which the
plaintiff
did in preparing a proposed CD entitled "Futureman"  The proposed CD
in its jacket cover sets out the basis of a story and songs
concerning events
surrounding "Futureman" and inter alia a lady known as "Star Machine".  In
February 1995 the plaintiff caused to
be left with the 8th defendant, Roadshow
Entertainment Pty Limited, a mock up of that CD and a folder containing the
information
in the CD in somewhat larger format.  Those materials are comprised
in exhibit A on the application before me.  On 29 August 1996
the plaintiff
became registered in respect of a trademark for a period of ten years
commencing 12 August 1996 which was registered
for the following goods and/or
services.  
<P>

	"Amusement apparatus adapted for use with television receivers only, amusement
machines, automatic and coin operated, animated
cartoon, cinematographic films,
compact discs, compact discs read only memory, computer programmes, computer
software, computers
and phonograph records being goods in class 9."
<P>

4	The material which was left with the 8th defendant was left for a period of
some weeks and was returned under cover of a letter
from the 8th defendant
dated 2 March 1995.  In that letter Mr G. Schlein, the National Sales Manager,
Roadshow New Media, said the
following:-
<P>

	"As you will be aware Roadshow New Medial are currently acting as distributors
for several overseas suppliers and at this stage
are not producing and
publishing product.  This is a possibility in the future.  Having seen your
"Futureman" in the early stage
of its development there is undoubtedly great
potential in the blossoming interactive program/games market.  We would most
definitely
be interested in distributing the product but do need to see
finished or near finished product before committing to a distribution
arrangement.  Please keep me informed as development continues."
<P>

5	The actual trade mark was the word, "Futureman".  In April 1997 a sculpture
entitled "Future Man" was erected at two new cinema
complexes.  The first one
was the Village Casino cinema in Melbourne and the other one was at a Sunshine
cinema also in Victoria.
 
<P>

6	As I have mentioned it is useful to deal with what is said to be in respect
of the copyright claim the work which is said to have
been infringed.  In his
Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiff described the nature of the work
as:-
<P>

	"The `Work' means deduced in hand form as `artistic works' and `other subject
matter' as `CD' and compilation under the title of
FUTUREMAN of the
plaintiff."
<P>

7	By way of particulars the plaintiff has identified the artistic work as:-
<P>

1.	The material which appears on an Internet site the detail of which material
is set out in an affidavit of Mr O'Leary's of 9 April
1999.  That material
which is Annexures A, B, C and D to that affidavit sets out copies of Web pages
which include a symbol of "Futureman",
details of Episode 1 which refers to the
story and song tracks and also a reference to the CD to which I have earlier
referred.
<P>

2.	The cover on the CD which is part of Exhibit A before me.
<P>

3.	The general use of the word and concept "Futureman".
<P>

8	This is a summary dismissal application and, of course, the types of cases
which will attract the Court's intervention at a summary
stage are very
limited.  
<P>

9	In <b>Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2078%20CLR%20622" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 78 CLR 622</a> Dixon J as
he then was said:-
<P>

	"A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the
court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for
determination in the
appointed manner by the court with or without a jury.  The fact that a
transaction is intricate may not disentitle
the court to examine a cause of
action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the
proceeding amounts to an abuse
of process or is vexatious.  But once it appears
that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that
the
rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the
court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and
an abuse of
process."
<P>

10	Reference was also made as is usual in a case of this nature which extended
into a second day's hearing to the proposition referred
to by Barwick CJ in
<b>General Steel Industries Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways</b>
<b>(NSW) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> at 130 that a conclusion proceedings should be
dismissed may be reached by a Court after argument "perhaps even of an
extensive kind
may be necessary to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff
is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed".
<P>

11	The applicants to the motion suggest that this is one of those cases as it
is clear because of the particularisation of the case
that the factual
background is well known at this stage.  It is submitted that at this stage the
plaintiff's case would not improve
through the further processes of preparation
for trial.
<P>

12	Before dealing with the more detailed basis of the claim I should note the
position of the different defendants.  The first defendant
Village Roadshow
Corporation Limited is the owner of trade marks.  That trade mark appears to be
affixed to a star on the belt of
the Future Man which is erected in the two
theatre complexes to which I have referred.  The second defendant, Village
Roadshow Limited
is a company which runs and operates the Two World complexes
where the two statues complained about are erected.  It also advertises
its
films at those complexes using a photographic reproduction in its
advertisements of those statues.  The third defendant, Amalgamated
Holdings
Limited is a company which is part of what is described as the Greater Union
Theatre Group and for the purposes of this
application it is clear that it is a
joint venture party with the second defendant and perhaps others to the
Megaplex theatre operations
at the two theatre complexes in Victoria.  The
fourth defendant is apparently an American company.  The plaintiff may or may
not
have effectively served that company which is a United States corporation
by sending the Statement of Claim or the Summons to it.
 In any event no
appearance has been entered for that company and accordingly, under Part 10
Rule 2 leave is required before the
plaintiff could proceed against that
company.  No leave has been obtained.  There is no appearance by that company
before me.  The
5th defendant, Palazzo Pty Ltd, did in conjunction with its
principal, Mr Hubert, design the sculptures which are complained of and
erected
at the two complexes.  The 6th defendant, Big Fish Workshop Pty Ltd is a
company which was involved with construction of
the sculpture and words and
marks to this effect appear on the right foot of each sculpture.  The 7th
defendant, Roadshow Music NSW
is not an entity but is in fact a business name
the proprietor of which is the 8th defendant.  It was to the 8th defendant,
Roadshow
Entertainment Pty Limited, to whom the material was made available by
the plaintiff in 1995.  There does not seem to be any evidence
that it has
reproduced the material.  
<P>

13	There is also a suggestion that there is a sculpture in Taiwan in some way
associated with some of the defendants of a similar
nature but somewhat larger
than the two to which I have referred.  
<P>

14	I turn first to the breach of copyright claim.  Clearly the plaintiff founds
this upon the artistic work which I have earlier
identified.  In submissions
the plaintiff suggested that there might be other types of work involved.
There is no musical work and,
to the extent that there has been the
commencement of an idea for a story theme, it may be said to be literary work.
However, no
case of reproduction of literary work is suggested.
<P>

15	I have earlier identified the exhibit which contains, so far as is in
material form, what is said to be the artistic work, namely,
material on the
Web site and on the cover of the CD.  The reproductions of the two sculptures
in Victoria can best be seen on a video
which is admitted as exhibit 12.  The
statues also feature in documents such as annual reports and a good example of
the sculpture
at the Crown Cinema is on page 13 exhibit 1, the Annual Report of
Village Roadshow Limited for 1997.  The use of that sculpture in
advertising is
also well shown in exhibit 9, a folder containing a number of
advertisements.
<P>

16	The nature of copyright in artistic work is the exclusive right to do any or
all of the following acts.
<P>

1.	Reproduce the work in a material form.
<P>

2.	To publish the work.
<P>

3.	To include the work in a television broadcast.
<P>

4.	To cause a television programme that includes the work to be transmitted to
subscribers to a diffusion serve.
<P>

Section 14 is important in that it provides that the doing of an act in respect
of a work in respect of a substantial part of the
work is deemed to be doing it
in respect of the whole work.  Before considering whether there has been any
reproduction by the defendants
it is necessary to note some authority.  In
<b>S.W. Hart &amp; Co. Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d5%29%20159%20CLR%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-5) 159 CLR
466</a> at 472 Gibbs CJ said the following in respect of the notion of
reproduction.
<P>

	"The notion of reproduction for the purposes of copyright law, involves two
elements - resemblance to, and actual use of, the copyright
work, or, to adopt
the words which appear in the judgment of Willmer LJ in <b>Francis Day &amp;
Hunter Ltd v Bron</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20Ch%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) Ch 587</a> at 614, `a sufficient degree of objective
similarity between the two works' and `some causal connection between the
plaintiffs' and
the defendants' work'.  Lord Reid said in <b>Ladbroke
(Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20WLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) WLR 273</a> at 276:
<P>

	`Broadly, reproduction means copying, and does not include cases where an
author or compiler produces a substantially similar result
by independent work
without copying.  And, if he does copy, the question whether he has copied a
substantial part depends much more
on the quality than on the quantity of what
he has taken.'
<P>

	(See also (1964) 1 WLR at 283, 288 and 293; (1964) 1 All ER at 473, 477 and
481.)  In the same case, Lord Evershed said (1964)
1 WLR at 283, `that what
amounts in any case to substantial reproduction...cannot be defined in precise
terms but must be a matter
of fact and degree".
<P>

17	The meaning of "substantial part" has been dealt with in many cases.  In
<b>Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2018%20IPR%20490" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 18 IPR 490</a> the Court referred to
the requirement that a substantial part of the work is reproduced and said:
<P>

	"It is well established that the phrase, "substantial part" refers to the
quality rather than the quantity of what is taken by
the infringer."
<P>

18	One can thus see that first there has to be a reproduction of a substantial
part of the artistic work as well as some causal
connection between the
plaintiff's and the defendants' work.  
<P>

19	It is worth noting that one cannot have copyright in a concept.  Reference
to this is made in <b>Zeccola v Universal City Studios Inc</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1982/241.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] FCA 241</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=46%20ALR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">46 ALR 189</a> at
192 where the Full Court said:-
<P>

	"In general there is no copyright in the central idea or theme of a story or
play however original it may be.  Copyright subsists
in the combination of
situations, events and scenes which constitute the particular working out or
expression of the idea or theme.
 If these are totally different the taking of
the idea or theme does not constitute an infringement of copyright."
<P>

20	American authority is the same.  In <b>Detective Comics Inc v Bruns
Publications Inc </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=111%20F2d%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">111 F.2d 432</a> the Court of Appeal said when dealing with
"Superman":-
<P>

	""So far as the pictorial representations and verbal descriptions of
`Superman' are not a mere delineation of a benevolent Hercules,
but embody an
arrangement of incidents and literary expressions original with the author,
they are proper subjects of copyright and
susceptible of infringement because
of the monopoly afforded by the act.  Since the complainant is not entitled to
a monopoly of
the mere character of a `Superman' who is a blessing to mankind
(Nichols v Universal Pictures Corp., 2 Cir.,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=45%20F2d%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">45 F.2d 119)</a>, we think the
language of clause 4(c) of the decree somewhat too sweeping."
<P>

21	It seems therefore that the plaintiff's case to the extent that it claims
that there is an artistic work in the concept of a
"Futureman" would be in
error.
<P>

22	The applicant's claim that there is a core problem with the plaintiff's
approach to the case.  The plaintiff's artistic work
arises from a proposed
story to be accompanied by songs.  The defendants' reproduction according to
the applicants is not of that
nature.  There is no story, no songs but in fact
merely a sculpture of a particular Future Man.  According to the applicants
because
the core qualities of the two works are different no substantial part
has been reproduced.  In any event that applicants submit when
one looks at
both the statute and the representation of Future Man on the plaintiff's
artistic work there is absolutely no similarity.
 
<P>

23	In submissions the plaintiff identified the similarities as being the
followings:-
<P>

1.	Silver armament.
<P>

2.	Yellow gloves.
<P>

3.	The belt.
<P>

4.	A determined face.
<P>

5.	Glowing eyes.
<P>

6.	Leg shield.
<P>

7.	Christ consciousness.
<P>

24	I deal with these in turn.
<P>

<b>1.	Silver armament.</b>
<P>

25	One statue appears to have a gold sheen which is suggestive of armour.  The
other is bronze with some blue lighting effect. 
In the artistic work the
drawings of the Future Man are variously black and purple except where the
portrayal is in human form.
<P>

<b>2.	Yellow gloves.</b>
<P>

26	One statue wears gloves which are the same colour as the rest of the statue.
In the artistic work there is one representation
which has a hand with what may
be a yellow glove.
<P>

<b>3.	The belt.</b>
<P>

27	The statue has a belt with a buckle with trade mark on it.  No such belt
appears in most of the representations in the artistic
work.  Such that do
appear are entirely different.
<P>

<b>4.	A determined face.</b>
<P>

28	The statue could have either an angry or determined face.  In the artistic
work I would describe the face (where there is one)
as angry.
<P>

<b>5.	Glowing eyes.</b>
<P>

29	The statue has glowing eyes.  In the artistic work some representations of
Future Man have glowing eyes.
<P>

<b>6.	Leg shield.</b>
<P>

30	One statue has a shin guard.  In the artistic work one of the reproductions
of Future Man has a shin guard on the left leg. 
See page 2 of the CD cover.
<P>

<b>7.	Christ consciousness.</b>
<P>

31	In its advertising some of the defendants have used a reproduction of the
statue walking on water.  The plaintiff suggests that
in the artistic work one
of the portrayals shows the Future Man in a crucifixion position.  I would have
likened the position to
someone about to dive or spring into space.  The
walking on water is alleged to be a copying of what was described as Future
Man's
"Christlike Consciousness".
<P>

32	If one compares the two statues with such portrayals as appear in the
artistic work there appears to be no similarity.  In the
artistic work Future
Man is portrayed figuratively as well as in human form.  There is no
consistency of portrayal and it appears
to me that it is the concept of a
Future Man which the plaintiff wishes to protect.  That is not allowable.
<P>

33	I have noted the similarities to which the plaintiff refers but I cannot see
how there could be any arguable case that there
is any objective similarity
between the works let alone a causal connection between them.
<P>

34	I turn to the trade mark claim propounded by the plaintiff.  It is apparent
that the plaintiff relies on s 120(1) of the Trademarks
Act 1995 to found
infringement.  That section is in the following terms:-
<P>

	120(1) A person infringes a registered trademark if the person uses as a
trademark a sign that is substantially identical with,
or deceptively similar
to, the trademark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the
trademark is registered."
<P>

35	I have earlier in paragraph 3 of this judgment referred to the goods and
services in respect of which the trademark is registered.
 For convenience I
repeat that reference which is follows:-
<P>

	"Amusement apparatus adapted for use with television receivers only, amusement
machines, automatic and coin operated, animated
cartoon, cinematographic films,
compact discs, compact discs read only memory, computer programmes, computer
software, computers
and phonograph records being goods in class 9."
<P>

36	The trademark in respect of which the plaintiff became registered is simply
the name "FUTUREMAN".  There are a number of ways
in which the defendants say
the plaintiff's claim must fail.  The first of these is that it is submitted
that there is no use in
relation to the goods or services in respect of which
the trademark is registered.  The only relevant use by the defendant is the
erection of the statue of Future Man either at the entrance to or in the foyer
of the theatre complex and reproductions of such statutes
in advertisements.
The statement of goods or services includes only one subject matter in which
there could be any relevant connection.
 That is "cinematographic films".  The
question really is whether that use of the statute is a use in such services or
goods.  Perhaps
arguably it could be suggested that the use of cinematographic
films requires a theatre complex for their viewing and to that extent
there may
be use in connection with such goods.  I do not think that on a summary
dismissal basis I should rely upon this ground
as there may be an arguable case
which might develop later.
<P>

37	The second ground upon which reliance is placed is that use of trademark as
a badge of origin of the goods indicating a connection
in the course of trade
between the goods and the person who supplies the goods.  See <b>Johnston &amp;
Johnston v Sterling</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/310.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 310</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20IPR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 IPR 1</a> at 10, 12 19, 24-25.  It is submitted there
that the use of the statue in the cinema complexes in no way indicates a badge
of origin
in respect of the products in the business of the second defendant,
namely, films.  Bearing in mind the comments I have made in respect
of the
first point and the use of the Future Man sculpture in advertisements it would
seem to me that it would be unsafe on a summary
dismissal basis to dismiss the
claim on this ground.
<P>

38	The third point which arises under s 120 is whether the use by the defendant
or some of them is substantially identical with
or deceptively similar to the
plaintiff's trademark.  Unfortunately in submissions the defendants seem to
have suggested that the
question is a comparison once again between the statues
in the cinema complex and the material at the Internet address and in the
CD.
This however is not the relevant comparison because the trademark is simply the
word "FUTUREMAN".  Normally the question is whether
the comparison between the
mark as registered and the mark sought to be argued as an infringement leads to
a conclusion that the
defendants' use of the mark indicates the origin of the
goods or services as being goods or services of the applicant for registration.
See <b>Mid City v Australian Tourism Co Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=40%20IPR%2020" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">40 IPR 20</a>, 29.  In this
case the defendants use the sculpture called "FUTURE MAN".  The separation into
two words I would not have thought
would be of great moment.  Of more
importance is that in advertising the defendants use their "FUTURE MAN" and the
concept of taking
the potential customer into the future.
<P>

39	In considering this question the matter has to be looked at fairly widely
because the ultimate decision is whether the plaintiff's
mark distinguishes his
goods or services from those of the defendants.  It is often said that there

 See <b>Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso
Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 66</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1963%20109%20CLR%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1963 109 CLR 407</a> at 425.  
<P>

40	A number of cases, although dealing with applications for registration, have
considered the question of deception, see for example,
<b>Southern Cross
Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd </b>(1953-54) 91 CLR 592 and
<b>Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F.S. Walton &amp; Co</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2058%20CLR%20641" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 58 CLR 641</a> at
658-659.  When considering the question of deception all the surrounding
circumstances have to be taken into consideration.  This
includes the
circumstances in which the marks will be used, the circumstances in which the
goods will be bought and sold, and the
character of the probable purchasers of
the goods.  See <b>Southern Cross Refrigeration </b>at 595.  
<P>

41	Always in the end it becomes a question of fact for the Court to decide
whether there is such a reasonable probability of deception
or confusion that
the use of the title should be restrained.  The plaintiff is using a mark and
it use is likely to be, given the
nature of the material which has been
advanced in the copyright claim, a use in the interactive video market.  The
question will
be whether the defendants' use of the word "Future Man" in its
market would be likely to cause deception.  Apart from the fact that
the
plaintiff has not yet commenced marketing the important matter is that this is
a serious factual matter for determination at
the trial.  In my view the matter
is not one where it is appropriate for there to be summary dismissal of the
claim although there
are many obvious difficulties in the claim which the
plaintiff will have to address if the plaintiff is to succeed.  
<P>

42	I turn to the use of confidential information claim.
<P>

43	In order to succeed in this action it is necessary for the plaintiff to
establish a number of elements.  These are:-
<P>

(a)	Identification of the information claimed to be confidential.
<P>

(b)	The information must have the appropriate quality of confidentiality.
<P>

(c)	The information must be disclosed in circumstances which impose on the
recipient an obligation to respect the confidentiality
of the information.
<P>

(d)	The recipient must breach the obligation to which he was subject.
<P>

44	So far as (a) is concerned, these are now clearly identified and include the
CD cover with its genesis of the story and the folder
which contained the same
material. 
<P>

45	So far as (b) is concerned, clearly at this stage on the evidence the
materials that were supplied were materials created by
the plaintiff.  There
does not seem to be any facts which would suggest that they were not his own
work and thus confidential.
<P>

46	So far as (c) is concerned, the information was disclosed in circumstances
where the plaintiff was seeking to encourage the 8th
defendant to participate
in some joint venture between them.  At least at the level at which I am
considering the matter one would
have thought that the circumstances were
sufficient to impose an obligation to respect the confidentiality of the
plaintiff's creation.
<P>

47	The matter of most probable dispute is whether there has been any breach of
the obligation in respect of confidentiality.  In
this regard it is clear that
there is a time lapse of some two years between the giving of the information
and subsequent appearances
of the Future Man statues in the cinema complexes.
The factual material presently before the Court does not establish that the
appearance
of these statues is in any way linked with the providing of the
confidential information to the 8th defendant.  The proceeding are
only just
commencing and there may be many areas of evidence which may be uncovered to
lead to a Court to form a view that links
the supply of the material to the
subsequent production of the statute.  As yet there have been no
interrogatories.  In these circumstances
I do not think that one could conclude
that the plaintiff will be unable at the hearing to establish the necessary
breach.  Accordingly,
I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to summarily
dismiss the plaintiff's claim for this matter.
<P>

48	In the result I am satisfied that the plaintiff's claim in respect of
copyright cannot succeed but the claims in respect of trademark
and breach of
confidential information should go ahead.
<P>

49	In these circumstances the orders that I make are:-
<P>

1.	Paragraphs 3 to 10 inclusive in the Statement of Claim be struck out.
<P>

2.	Plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of the motion.
