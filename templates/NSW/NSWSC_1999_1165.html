ANNE-MARIE CAMERON
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Four claims for provision out of the estate of the
testatrix were heard together.  The testatrix was born on 11
January 1921 at
Versailles in France.  She emigrated to Australia with her eldest three
children to join her husband in 1952 and
lived here until her death on 18 May
1998.  Her husband Gerard Renee Jean Francois Cassegrain was born at Orleans on
26 November
1923, emigrated to Australia about 1951 and died on 29 October
1993.  
<P>

2  	The testatrix and her husband had six children all of whom
survived her and are parties to this litigation.  They are:
<P>

Catherine Brigitte Dunn who was born in France on 27 September 1946;
<P>

Claude George Rene Cassegrain who was born on 27 September 1947; 
<P>

Patrick Anthony Cassegrain who was born on 22 August 1950.
<P>

John Baptiste Cassegrain who was born in Australia on 14 January 1956;
<P>

Denis Patrick Cassegrain who was born on 10 January 1962;
<P>

Anne-Marie Cameron who was born on 1 April 1963.
<P>

3  	The testatrix's family are referred to hereafter by their first
Christian names as they usually were in the evidence.  No other
person eligible
to make a claim under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> has been identified by evidence,
no claim has been made and none is likely.
<P>

4  	The testatrix and her husband emigrated to Australia without
significant resources and Gerard supported the family by his own
labour.  For
some years they lived in very poor circumstances with some hardship.  In the
1960s Gerard established the Expressway
Spares business dealing in spare parts
for earth moving equipment and large vehicles in premises on the Pacific
Highway near Wauchope,
New South Wales.  Expressway Spares Pty Ltd was formed
in 1965, and has grown to be large and prosperous, and although there is no
satisfactory valuation of the company as a whole in evidence, its value is at
least $11,500,00.00 and probably more.  Expressway
Spares and money generated
by its business was the source of family prosperity and resources used in other
ventures for over 25 years
until Gerard's death.
<P>

5  	During his lifetime Gerard maintained patronal control over the
affairs of Expressway Spares and of several other companies
in which he held
shares, and other family members held shares which he had arranged for them to
have.  Business matters and the family
interests were often discussed among
family members in highly informal ways, such as over the dinner table, but
regardless of patterns
of shareholdings and offices held in various companies,
the effectual decisions were made by Gerard, and his decisions were influenced
by the views of others only according to his own judgment from time to time.
Claude and Anne-Marie had academic training in business
management, but formal
processes of business management did not have much influence on affairs.  When
funds were required for some
project they were raised in whatever manner seemed
expedient at the time, with inter-company loans and sometimes by using the
personal
credit of a family member to support a venture in which the particular
family member had no direct interest.  At the end of Gerard's
life the pattern
of ownership of shares, land and other significant assets was chaotic.  Gerard
owned significant parcels of land
jointly with Francoise, but the shares which
he held did not, on the face of things, confer on him his actual domination of
the affairs
of Expressway Spares or of other companies.  All his significant
assets passed under his will or by survivorship in joint tenancies
to
Francoise.  For that reason contributions to the assets of Gerard made by any
of his children should be regarded as indirectly
contributing to the assets of
Francoise.  After Gerard's death new family dynamics operated, and patterns of
shareholding and details
of entitlement acquired significance which had not
earlier been  apparent.  
<P>

6  	The contribution made by Francoise throughout her life to the
well-being of the family were very substantial.  In Gerard's life
time the
family members worked together, on the whole with good will, and with diligence
each according to his or her ability.  The
actual values of the contributions
of each were different, and the outcomes were different, but all made sincere
endeavours with
the object of a good outcome for all interests associated with
Gerard as well as for the individual members of the family.  This
state of
goodwill and co-operation continued after Gerard's death, but by 1996 it was
being broken up by conflict.  This conduct
extending over many years, in which
the plaintiffs participated sincerely, contributed greatly to the assets which
Francoise accumulated,
most notably her real estate and Expressway Spares
shares.  
<P>

7  	From 1977 until Gerard died Gerard, Francoise and their children
each owned 15 shares in Expressway Spares Pty Ltd, except Anne-Marie
who owned
35. There were and now are 140 issued shares.  The reasons for the disparity
are not now clear or important; a statement
attributed in evidence to Francoise
bases it on the view that Anne-Marie as the youngest could be expected to need
greater assistance.
 Significant disparity first arose when Anne-Marie was
three years old and has persisted through all later changes in the pattern
of
shareholdings.  Gerard's 15 shares passed to Francoise, so she, Claude and
Anne-Marie were together able to cast 80 of 140 votes
at general meetings and
hence achieve practical control of Expressway Spares and its affairs; and they
did associate together to
do that. 
<P>

8  	A number of other companies in which family members had interests
or exercised control were mentioned in evidence and it is
significant to refer
to three of them.  Gerard Cassegrain &amp; Co. Pty Ltd (GC &amp; Co.) was
formed in 1960 and first carried on
business in log hauling, but from 1967 its
business was land acquisition and development.  At earlier times shares in GC
&amp; Co.
were held equally by family members but late in Gerard's life the
conduct of its affairs came to be the principal outlet for Claude's
activities,
and the pattern of shareholding was changed.  After Gerard's death there were
120 shares in GC &amp; Co of which Francoise
owned 20, Claude owned 30 and his
wife Felicity owned 20, and Francoise's other sons and daughters each owned 10.
Francoise, Claude
and Felicity acting together could thus cast 70 of 120 votes
at general meetings and control decisions.  In practical terms GC &amp;
Co has
been under Claude's control since Gerard died and still is.
<P>

9  	Cassegrain Vineyards Pty Ltd operates a winery and vineyard at
premises on Pacific Highway close to the Expressway Spares business.
 Soon
after Cassegrain Vineyards was formed in 1980 its shareholding took the form
that there were 96 shares on issue, 20 of which
were owned by John, 20 by his
wife Eva, while Gerard and Francoise and their five other sons and daughters
each owned 8 shares.
<P>

10  	Cassegrain Tradition Pty Ltd was formed in 1988 and established
and carried on a business of manufacturing smallgoods.  When
it was formed
Gerard and Francoise and five of their sons and daughters each owned 10 shares
and Denis owned 50 shares, a total of
120 shares.  Its business of processing
smallgoods, in a factory constructed for that purpose, was never established
with success
and its operations were wound down in 1992.  Later from December
1994 to June 1996 it operated a restaurant at the winery.  It also
for a time
earned income by leasing its factory to Midco, a smallgoods manufacturer.
<P>

11  	In June 1994 the shareholdings in Cassegrain Vineyards and
Cassegrain Tradition were reorganised.  Expressway Spares became
the only
beneficial owner of shares in those companies, and still is.
<P>

12  	It will be seen that for each of these three companies one of
Francoise's sons, himself or with his wife, controlled about
41.67 per cent of
the shares.  Circumstances in which this ended in June 1994 and only Claude has
a company in which he has a significant
shareholding are a source of grievances
the merits of which I need not decide.
<P>

13  	One respect in which business affairs of Expressway Spares and
the Cassegrain family were strikingly strange is that, although
Expressway
Spares owned and owns other parcels of land, the land on which its business
premises and almost all its operations are
conducted has never been owned by
it.  Expressway Spares has never had a lease or other arrangement recorded in
writing, or any other
arrangement made in any way, under which it had an
entitlement to occupy that land.  Some inconclusive entries in the directors'
minutes over 25 years before Gerard died record that attention was given to
obtaining a lease, but no lease was ever entered into,
and any lease then
contemplated would have expired many years before Gerard died.  In many
building projects over several decades
Expressway Spares built and paid for the
construction of many buildings, extensions and other improvements on the land,
and for some
reason which evidence does not explain treated the improvements
but not the land as assets of the company in its accounts.  No explanation
was
given in evidence of why this was done or how it could be right, and it
obviously was not right; the company had no such asset
unless it had some title
to the land.  The situation in which, for decades, Gerard was in control of
Expressway Spares' affairs and
authorised expenditure by the company on
improvements on land of which he with Francoise was joint owner provides no
basis for inferring
that there were some implied or unrecorded arrangements
affecting ownership of the land.  Gerard and Francoise owned the land; they
entered into no lease and received no rent or other income relating to it
except the advantages flowing to them as owners of shares
in Expressway Spares.
They had an interest in the company's prosperity which could be thought of as
supporting their accepting that
the company had the advantage of occupation of
the land without paying any rent.  As land-owners they could only gain by the
company's
paying for improvements to be erected on their land.  Gerard was the
controlling mind of Expressway Spares, and it would not be right
to conclude
that the company in some way misunderstood the position, or acted on any basis
which could give rise to a proprietary
estoppel.  
<P>

14  	When she became sole owner of the land Francoise was in the
economic position of being able to control Expressway Spares; she
could if she
wished eject the company and destroy its business, and this gave her a firm
hand in its affairs.  During her life the
strength of her position was
reflected in negotiations within the family for her to grant a lease to
Expressway Spares and receive
the large income which would be generated by an
appropriate rent; however, in the continuing state of conflict, no outcome was
ever
achieved.  Anne-Marie to whom the land passed under Francoise's will
occupies a correspondingly strong position.
<P>

15  	The tests for relevance in subs.9(3) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
are very wide and the parties omitted from evidence little if anything of the
many conflicts and controversies which have occurred
among themselves.  The
evidence included details of many controversies the merits of which it does not
seem possible now to untangle
or determine objectively.  The question whether
Claude is a suitable person in whom to place confidence is usually involved in
these
controversies. Francoise, Claude and Anne-Marie regarded it as
appropriate for Claude to have the leading position in the business
affairs of
the family, while the plaintiffs regarded Claude as highly unsuitable.
<P>

16  	There have been a number of attempts to resolve family
conflicts, and on several occasions overall resolution seemed close
but was not
achieved.  A mediation was conducted while the Federal Court proceedings were
pending, without resolution.  Justice Davies
in his judgment made observations
pointing out courses open, and his Honour's observations if followed would have
resolved or minimised
conflict.  These observations do not seem to have
produced any impact on the behaviour of parties.  Given this history it is not
reasonable to expect that there will be co-operation in the future; the
probabilities are that family affairs including affairs of
Expressway Spares
will continue to be conducted with conflict, hostile exploitation of
opportunities and ready resort to litigation.
 The family's prosperity could
easily be brought down.
<P>

17  	It was the defendants' case that events relating to Federal
Court proceedings bring the character and conduct of the plaintiffs
under
consideration within subs.9(3)(b), and that the effect of such consideration
should be that no provision ought to be made or
that any provision made ought
to be moderate.  The Federal Court proceedings were commenced in July 1996.  At
the time of the testatrix'
death the hearing was completed and reserved
judgment was awaited.  The judgment was published on 15 July 1998.  The present
plaintiffs
obtained a declaration establishing matters adverse to Claude in
these terms:
<P>

<i>"THE COURT DECLARES THAT:</i>
<P>

<i>The actions of the first respondent, Claude George Rene Cassegrain, in
treating the $4.25m loan account with Gerard Cassegrain &amp;
Co Pty Ltd as his
entitlement to be drawn down at his will, in drawing upon the loan account as
he saw fit and in causing the passing
of a resolution of directors allowing for
the payment of retrospective interest thereon were actions which were
oppressive of and
unfairly prejudicial to the members of the company.</i>
<P>

<i>THE COURT ORDERS THAT:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	The application be otherwise dismissed.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	That each party abide his, her or its own costs of the
proceedings."</i>
<P>

18  	They obtained no other relief; the Federal Court did not in any
manner intervene in the affairs of the family companies.  There
were factual
findings about many subjects of controversy, and observations by Justice Davies
on the conduct of affairs which I would
respectfully say appear to have been
well considered and wise; however these observations have no force unless those
concerned choose
to follow them, and they have not.  Each party was left to pay
the costs which had been incurred.  The litigation involved the attention
and
energies of family members for about two years and the expense relating to it
was very great; well over $1,000,000.  The relief
in the form of a declaration
relating to Claude was a ridiculously small outcome from so much effort.  The
proceedings were a wasteful
fiasco, they used up large resources uselessly, and
with the benefit of hindsight it can be seen that it was a very great blunder
for the plaintiffs to bring the proceedings and involve other family members in
them.
<P>

19  	The proceedings arose largely out of conduct of Claude and the
adherence of the testatrix and also of Anne-Marie to Claude,
putting him in a
very strong position in the affairs of Expressway Spares, and also in other
family affairs.  The plaintiffs were
entitled to approach the Federal Court and
seek relief, and in doing so they came under the necessity of joining
Francoise, who was
one of the shareholders in closely-held family companies, as
a respondent.  This was not an expression of hostility against her.
 The attack
on Claude was perceived by her as an attack on herself, and she took an active
stand in resisting the litigation, making
common cause with Claude and
Anne-Marie.  This continued a position she had clearly adopted before the
litigation began in which
she adhered to Claude as a suitable person to control
family affairs and gave him her practical and moral support.  She was entitled
to make this choice, but it was not reasonable for her to take the view that no
one should see Claude differently. She expressed
very strong loyalty to Claude,
and hostility towards the plaintiffs, and also other persons associated with
family affairs, to an
extent which was not reasonable.  She could have chosen
to see the litigation as having little potential effect on her own interests
and have taken a submitting part in it; but she did not do that and took a
position which fully accorded with her decision to give
her adherence to
Claude.  A claim introduced late in the proceedings was adverse to her
landholding; however Davies J did not uphold
this claim, or make an order
determining it: nor do I, but it seems to have no substance. She had assurances
from Claude that the
litigation was directed against him, that he would manage
it and that she did not need to worry; see transcript 315-316; these assurances
were correct but she does not seem to have accepted them.  In evidence in the
Family Court proceedings she professed (affidavit of
17 July 1996) "<i>In my
attitude and my love I have never, and will never, favour one child over
another."</i>  Her conduct and particularly the dispositions of her will do not
bear this out.
<P>

20  	Francoise felt and expressed very strong resentment against the
plaintiffs for joining her as a party, and this was developed
by expressions of
resentment of particular aspects of the litigation such as the need to produce
documents including Gerard's diaries
on discovery, and the need for her to give
oral evidence. The testatrix expressed strong adverse feelings about her being
required
to attend for cross-examination.  In my view this requirement arose
not so much from her being joined in the proceedings as from
her taking an
active part, in common with Claude and Anne-Marie, in defending the
proceedings, making common cause with Claude and
Anne-Marie and giving evidence
in support of the respondents' case.  That she was cross-examined followed from
the position she adopted;
and her adopting that position was not wholly the
applicants' doing.  In my view the testatrix made more of a grievance of the
matter
of cross-examination than was truly warranted.  In my view she resented
these aspects of the litigation to an excessive extent and
used the litigation
to indulge and to express feelings of hostility to a greater degree than was
appropriate, even for a person who
had been involved in large-scale proceedings
by close family members.  In the very last weeks before her death her position
moderated,
and after refusing or severely limiting contact with the plaintiffs
she returned to relatively appropriate conduct and communications
with them.
This occurred when she was dying and it is likely that she was aware that she
was.  
<P>

21  	In my finding the testatrix felt and expressed excessive
resentment and hostility towards the plaintiffs in connection with
Federal
Court litigation, and indulged her feelings to an excessive degree, even though
resentment and hostility were not inappropriate.
 With hindsight it is known
that the litigation achieved no practical success and was a gigantic folly,
very wasteful of resources
and an enormous further disruption of already
disrupted family relationships.  I see the plaintiffs' conduct in relation of
the Federal
Court proceedings as adverse to their claim, not because it was
hostile to the testatrix, but because it was folly, wasteful of her
resources
and those of persons close to her, and for that reason as qualifying any view
that provision ought to be made for the plaintiffs
out of her estate.  After
conducting themselves and using resources in this way, they ought not to be
treated with generosity.

23  	Francoise's 30 Expressway Spares shares are not the subject of
agreement as to their value.  The value of those shares is very
difficult to
see; there is no market in them and no means ready to hand for realising their
value; the practical advantages of owning
the shares depends on the manner in
which company affairs are conducted.  The company paid a dividend in 1998, but
that has been
its only dividend.  The company is now operating very
successfully and may continue as a going concern for many years; but in the
absence of a market in them the shares will be of little value except in
relation to dividends which may be paid; and there is no
basis for any
confident prediction about whether or not earnings will be reflected in
dividends.  Consideration of what would happen
if Expressway Spares were
wound-up and the proceeds of sale of its business were distributed among
shareholders is subject to there
being no basis for a confident prediction
about whether that will happen.  The holder of the testatrix' shares is not in
a position
to bring about either result.
<P>

24  	The material in evidence bearing on the value of Expressway
Spares Pty Ltd and its shares is Exhibit 14, a report by Mr Grant
Harrison of
NorthCorp Accountants which was completed on 28 April 1999.  This is not a
valuation but a compilation of materials from
a number of sources largely
assembled by Claude and those advising him.  On the material before him Mr
Harrison gave the total realisable
value of the assets of Expressway Spares as
$24,449,804.00, liabilities as $12,937,009.00, and excess of assets over
liabilities
of $11,512,795.00.  By direct proportion the estate shares were
valued at $2,467,027.00.  The values of many assets and the amounts
of many
liabilities are however open to further consideration.  The choice of approach
to valuation of stock could produce huge variations
in the overall conclusion.
The book value at 30 June 1998 was $2.8 million at scrap value; this is an
understatement.  Mr Harrison
saw a valuation by G.E. Capital Asset Services
&amp; Trading Asia Pacific Pty Ltd as of January 1999 at $10.7 million in an
orderly
liquidation and he adopted this figure.  However he also saw a
valuation by Steers Pty Ltd as of February 1999 which gave the fair
market
value, which apparently means retail value, of the stock at $37.7 million and
the realisation at a forced auction at $20.1
million.  Mr Harrison also
included goodwill at $3,860,000 when giving the realisable value of the assets;
however he pointed out
forcefully the difficulties of quantifying valuation of
goodwill.
<P>

25  	The reasoning which produced $2,467,027 as the value of the
shares owned by the testatrix would support attributing $1,233,513
to the
shareholdings of each of the plaintiffs.  With good management they could well
bring much more; the possibility that they
are worth over $2 million for each
plaintiff could easily be realised.  For any consideration of the value of the
plaintiffs' shareholdings
or of the estate shareholdings, the difficulties of
realisation both of capital and of income should always be kept well in mind.
Mr Harrison's conclusion appears to me to be conservative and the position
could well be that with good management the value of Expressway
Spares and of
shares in it will be much greater than the figures he gives, whether valued in
terms of earnings or of realisation
on disposition of the business.  However
the whole subject of valuation is highly indeterminate, assumptions that
affairs will be
well managed cannot be confidently made, and the plaintiffs do
not have the power to realise the value of their shares suggested
by
arithmetically applying  direct proportion to the total value of the company's
assets.
<P>

26  	The estate appears to have only one substantial liability,
namely the testatrix' joint and several liability to the solicitors
retained
for the respondents for costs of the Federal Court proceedings.  The evidence
of a member of the solicitors' firm is that
the outstanding legal fees, and
interest to the time of hearing, amount to $557,745.61.  The evidence shows
that there was no special
arrangement and no detailed arrangement defining the
basis on which costs would be charged or establishing which of the respondents
would bear them, or that they would be borne in any particular proportions.  It
follows that as she joined in giving the instructions
Francoise incurred joint
and several liability to the solicitors for whatever is an appropriate sum for
them to charge; and in the
entire absence of any other arrangement, the
ordinary consequence, which appears to apply here, is that each of the
respondents who
joined in retaining the solicitors would be liable for the
whole amount but entitled to contributions from each other respondent
so that
overall the burden was borne equally; this would include each respondent who
retained the solicitors, whether an individual
or a corporation, as an equal
contributor.  If the only persons under a common liability were the individuals
and if they contributed
equally the testatrix' estate would be liable for
$185,915.20, and this liability would fall on the residuary estate. Claude and
Anne-Marie are at risk, including risk as to their continuing in office as
trustees, if they throw an inappropriate part of the common
liability for the
costs to the Federal Court proceedings onto the estate; their own interests are
involved, and it would be perilous
for them to give themselves any unfair
advantage.
<P>

27  	The testatrix dealt extremely generously with Anne-Marie and
also with Claude in her will, and also made dispositions to companies.
 The
benefits which she provided for them were far greater than any benefit which it
could be appropriate for the court to order
for them.  However she had a legal
right to dispose of her own assets, subject only to any order which the court
may make under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a>.  It is not part of the court's
function to consider whether her generosity was excessive, or to correct it or
produce an overall
fair result.
<P>

28  	The testatrix, who made three earlier wills, made the will which
took effect on 23 April 1998 in the last weeks of her life,
when the Federal
Court proceedings were under reserved judgment and her estrangement with the
plaintiffs was moderating.  The table
of agreed values illustrates the gifts.
There are a number of specific gifts; Francoise's jewellery and watches were
given to Anne-Marie
and Felicity (who is married to Claude), the household
contents were given to Claude and an antique clock was given to Denis.  A
Peugeot motor car of no great value was given to Anne-Marie.  Claude was also
given a parcel of shares in CTK Pty Ltd, a company
of no great value in which
other family members have shareholdings.  Anne-Marie and Denis were each given
a small holding of vineyard
land; these gifts have no real relation to the
activities or interests of either of them.  Anne-Marie lives nearby but in
relation
the interests and activities of Denis, gifts of a home site and
vineyard at Wauchope and an antique clock are all but irrelevant.
 The
testatrix' most significant parcel of land, on which the Expressway Spares'
business is conducted, was given to Anne-Marie and
its agreed value is
$4,000,000.  She gave several parcels of land to companies; a minor parcel to a
vineyard company and three parcels
of some economic significance to GC &amp;
Co, which is under Claude's control.  A number of relatively minor assets were
given to
her residuary trust, as were her 30 shares in Expressway Spares.  
<P>

29  	While her many other gifts were of value and should not be lost
sight of, their value was greatly outweighed by the principal
gifts, the land
to Anne-Marie and the Expressway Spares shares to the residuary trust.  The
residuary trust is a discretionary trust
as to capital and income until the
year 2015.  Whatever may be the assets of this trust in 2015 will be
distributable equally among
19 named beneficiaries who are children and
grandchildren of the testatrix.  Until then however the assets of the trust are
subject
to discretionary powers of distribution as to capital and income among
those 19 persons.  These discretionary powers are expressed
to be absolute, and
Claude and Anne-Marie may exercise them in favour of themselves and their own
children as well as of any others.
 In reality there is no prospect of
challenge to any decision they make, unless they give reasons which show that
the decision was
made for an improper purpose.  Claude and Anne-Marie are
entitled to cast the votes of trust shares at general meetings of Expressway
Spares, and these votes with their own place them in practical control of the
company's affairs if they act together and notwithstanding
wishes of the
plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs have practically nothing to hope for in terms of
exercises of discretion favourable to
them, and they have no real prospects of
resisting distribution of all trust assets to persons other than themselves
before the distribution
date, which is still about 16 years in the future.  
<P>

30  	In different ways each of the plaintiffs involved his or her
life and working career in the family's business affairs.  In
no case is there
any basis for finding that their conduct towards the testatrix was
inappropriate until the first half of 1996 when
her  firm adherence to Claude
became evident.  It is not disputed that each of the plaintiffs made honest
efforts to contribute to
the family prosperity.
<P>

31  	Over many years Catherine gave Francoise assistance in many ways
appropriate for an eldest daughter of a mother who had five
younger children.
She was a personal and social support to her mother, who was always much more
confident in French than in English,
and needed and received her daughter's
help in many ways, including dealings with persons outside the family.
Catherine worked as
a receptionist in the Expressway Spares business for many
years and still does.  Her earnings have been modest.  She has three adult
sons.  She participated in dealings in land by or under the control of Gerard
and conformed with his wishes in acquiring and also
disposing of property.  Her
husband Jim Dunn turned away from his general building business and development
projects and now for
over 20 years has worked on building projects associated
with Expressway Spares and other Cassegrain interests; he has done a great
deal
of work on many projects and charged basic carpentry wages for his time.  From
1990 he participated in business administration,
and he was a director of
Expressway Spares for several years.  Between them they have built up
significant assets, including a commodious
family home at Wauchope near the
Expressway Spares premises, and a residential property in a Sydney suburb which
is occupied by their
sons.  Building up their assets was at least in part
assisted by their association with the Cassegrain business interests; Jim Dunn
was able to spend well over a year of his own time on building their house, and
he used some company equipment for the purpose. 
Although the two house
properties are significant assets Catherine now has little else apart from her
Expressway Spares shares, and
Jim Dunn is approaching the end of his working
life without any further capital fund for retirement.  Apart from her interest
in
the residuary trust Catherine received no benefit under Francoise's will.
Catherine has involved her adult life largely in family
affairs including the
affairs of Expressway Spares, and her claim to be put in the position where she
can in economic reality enjoy
the benefits of her shareholding is strong.  If
her shareholding is unproductive she will not be adequately maintained in the
later
years of her life.  She has various obligations, most notably relating to
costs incurred in the Federal Court proceedings.  However
plaintiffs, including
Catherine, do not have a claim on their mother's bounty in respect of that
folly.
<P>

32  	Catherine has a special need for provision which relates to road
access to the house at Wauchope which she and Jim Dunn jointly
own.  For many
years they have had access under informal arrangements which were made by
Gerard with them, under which they have
actually been able to pass over a
parcel of land owned by Expressway Spares.  This parcel of land has not been
actively used by Expressway
Spares although in the future some use for it may
present itself; it appears to have been held for many years as an investment.
It
has a frontage to Sancrox Road.  In the past Catherine and Jim Dunn owned
other legal means of access, which they let go because
they felt they were in a
position to rely on access through the Expressway Spares land.  Their evidence
was inaccurate and confused
as to some details of this history relating to
events of many years ago, but it is clear that they were encouraged by
Expressway
Spares in the person of Gerard to rely on informal access over land
owned by that company, that they did so rely and that while they
did so they
lost opportunities to obtain legal access in other ways.  Their claim for grant
of a right of way against Expressway
Spares on equitable principles appears to
me to be a strong one.  Expressway Spares is in a position to resolve this
need, and at
one time appeared to be about to do so; but the grant of a right
of way was prevented by action of Claude, who has explained this
by
dissatisfaction with what he saw as irregular proceedings by other directors to
grant the right of way.  Catherine's need for
sufficient resources to resolve
this problem is very strong, and until it is resolved provision made for her
can be no more than
an interim order, as in justice it is necessary to reserve
the court's opportunity to award her further resources to enable her to
resolve
the problem, it may be by buying access from another neighbour.
<P>

33  	Patrick has spent most of his working life in the employment of
Expressway Spares, and has worked for that company continuously
since 1977.  He
has one adult son.  He owns a house and his Expressway Spares shares, but
otherwise his assets are not significant.
 Apart from the residuary trust he
received no benefit under the will.  He spent earlier periods of his life
working elsewhere, or
working for CTK Engineering Pty Ltd and also earlier in
life lived in France for some periods.  He too supported Gerard's ventures
by
lending his name to a real estate investment.  He has worked long and hard in
Expressway Spares' affairs, and was in management
positions during the years of
the company's growth to great success.  He has not been paid at high rates.
Except in relation to the
Federal Court proceedings no inappropriate behaviour
of his directed against the testatrix has been established.  He gave in
evidence
a list of large capital expenditures, somewhat removed from reality,
which he would wish to make.  I regard him as having a strong
claim on the
testatrix' bounty with respect to giving reality to the provision which Gerard
made for him long ago by giving him his
shareholding in Expressway Spares.
<P>

34  	John Cassegrain is married and has two dependent children.  For
many years throughout the successful development of the winery
and construction
of its premises he was employed in the Cassegrain winery by Cassegrain
Vineyards.  For some years he held or expected
to hold about 40% of the shares
in Cassegrain Vineyards.  Development of Cassegrain Vineyards and the
prosperity of the winery depended
on availability of financial support and
continued investments from other Cassegrain interests.  After Gerard died the
impetus for
further large investment for John's benefit came to an end and
Expressway Spares became the owner of all the shares.  His employment
by
Cassegrain Vineyards ended late in 1998 after an unsuccessful struggle with
Claude for control of its affairs. Although he owns
a house there is a
deficiency of his assets to his liabilities, largely because of liabilities
incurred in connection with the Federal
Court proceedings, unless his shares in
Expressway Spares are brought into consideration.  He and his wife Eva who had
also been
employed by Cassegrain Vineyards brought proceedings against
Cassegrain Vineyards over employment entitlements, and these were settled
on a
basis which will bring them $71,300 less applicable tax; they will still have a
deficiency of assets to liabilities.  After
a period without employment John
has obtained good employment as General Manager of Pepper Tree Winery at
$75,000 per year.  This
is a good and remunerative position; unlike his earlier
positions he is at arm's-length with his employer.  He is highly trained
and
highly skilled as a wine-maker and has a history of success, and his career
prospects are good.  He is now facing life in his
mid-40s with dependent
children, good employment but no significant net capital apart from his
Expressway Spares shares.  For his
maintenance and advancement in life he is in
need of having the advantages of owning those shares brought to reality.
<P>

35  	Denis Cassegrain is 37 years of age and he married on 14
November 1998.  For some years he worked in the affairs of Cassegrain
Tradition
and sought to establish that company's business in the manufacture of
smallgoods.  Cassegrain Tradition was well supported
by money from family
enterprises under the influence of Gerard, and although a large investment said
to be more than $1,000,000 went
into the construction of the factory and the
establishment of its business, it did not succeed.  This was not for lack of
endeavour
on Denis' part.  From 1992 onwards Cassegrain Tradition conducted a
restaurant at the winery and Denis worked in that; however this
business too
came to an end.  Cassegrain Tradition for some period received rental income
from another smallgoods manufacturer which
rented the factory, and Denis drew
income from Cassegrain Tradition.  He has been supported in this way during
long periods when
in fact he has had nothing to do.  More recently he has found
employment elsewhere in the smallgoods manufacturing business.  He
is not
highly qualified, and unlike John he cannot point to a record of success in his
chosen industry.  He is able to earn sufficient
money to support himself, but
not to support his wife and their intended family, and it appears likely that
they will be dependent
to a significant extent on her future earnings.  He gave
in evidence an unrealistic wish-list of resources, but as a member of the
Cassegrain family he ought to have the actual benefit of the provision which
Gerard gave to him long ago.
<P>

36  	Denis was of great assistance to Francoise, and for a long time
lived in her home, although this ended after the estrangement
associated with
the Federal Court proceedings.  He is however capable of strange behaviour and
uncouth expressions, and very late
in the testatrix' life became involved in an
unpleasant confrontation with Claude and Nicholas Cameron, Anne-Marie's
husband, which
led to charges of assault and applications for Apprehended
Violence orders.  Claude's behaviour in this confrontation was also
unsatisfactory;
but he is not asking for assistance from the Court.
<P>

37  	It is desirable that the family's affairs should be separated to
a greater extent than at present or completely, so that each
member can control
his or her own assets and economic destiny.  If this is to happen it will
involve in some way reorganising Expressway
Spares; and there are a number of
different forms which reorganisation could take.  These could include selling
the company's business
and distributing proceeds to shareholders in a
liquidation or by some other mechanism; and the purchasers of the business
could be
or be related to some family members, or could be wholly unrelated.
The reorganisation could also take the form of continuing the
company's
business with the shares held by family members but changing the policies of
the Board and, it may be, the membership of
the Board and bringing about
regular distributions of dividends.  The Court is not equipped to make the
commercial decisions involved
or to supervise their being carried out over many
months or some years.  The parties would be able to do this if the influence of
the testatrix's shares in forming a dominating block of shareholdings and votes
in the hands of Claude and Anne-Marie is neutralised
and does not represent an
augmentation to the strength of Claude and Anne-Marie as shareholders in their
own right. Whatever decisions
are made and however matters are managed, the
possibility of a poor outcome can be clearly seen; this possibility is ever
present
in commerce and is augmented by internal conflict.  
<P>

38  	The powers of the Court extend far beyond ordering that
provision be made by payment of the sum or allocation of an asset to
a
claimant.  Powers are enumerated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11</a> and s.<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">15</a> and include limiting and
controlling the use of powers by trustees.  
<P>

39  	In <i>Singer v Berghouse <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a></i> at 208-209 Mason
CJ Deane &amp; McHugh JJ introduced their consideration, extending to p212, of
the jurisdiction of the Court under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> and subs.9(2) as follows:
<P>

<i>"It is clear that, under these provisions, the Court is required to carry
out a two-stage process.  The first stage calls for a determination
of whether
the applicant has been left without adequate provision for his or her proper
maintenance, education and advancement in
life.  The second stage, which only
arises if that determination be made in favour of the applicant, requires the
court to decide
what provision ought to be made out of the deceased's estate
for the applicant.  The first stage has been described as the `jurisdictional
question'.  That description means no more than that the court's power to make
an order in favour of an applicant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> is conditioned upon the court
being satisfied of the state of affairs predicated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9(2)(a)."</a></i>
<P>

As their Honours' later observations show, the two stages are not wholly
distinct.
<P>

40  	I turn to subs.9(2).  In my finding the provision made for each
of the plaintiffs by the testatrix in her will has left each
of them without
adequate provision for proper maintenance and advancement in life.  The
inadequacy is in respect of the practically
uncontrolled influence which the
dispositions of the will give the defendants over each of the plaintiffs'
interests in Expressway
Spares (which represent provision made in favour of
them by Gerard) and also over their interests in the residuary estate provided
for them by the testatrix.  The defendants have been given practically
unchallenged discretionary control and are unlikely to exercise
their powers in
ways which give substance to the provisions. It cannot realistically be
expected that these powers will be exercised
objectively.
<P>

41  	The provisions for the plaintiffs already made by Gerard in
endowing them with Expressway Spares shares and by the testatrix
in her will
indicate what is adequate provision for them in their circumstances. The
plaintiffs are without any control over their
endowment and without any real
access to it.  It was within the testatrix' power not to impose this
barrier.
<P>

42  	Because of the established history of conflict with the
plaintiffs Claude and Anne-Marie are unsuitable persons to exercise
the very
wide discretionary powers which Francoise's will gave them over her residuary
trust; the strong probability is in casting
votes at general meetings of
Expressway Spares, or exercising the discretionary powers of trustees, they
will not act dispassionately
or on a fair basis.  While it is not impossible
that some benefits may flow to the plaintiffs from the exercise of these
discretionary
powers, it is very unlikely that they will receive any
substantial advantage.  
<P>

43  	The scale of provision which ought to be made for the plaintiffs
in the circumstances of their lives and their relationships
with the testatrix,
in the context of their relationships with Gerard during his lifetime and of
the family's resources and prosperity,
is in my judgment established by the
provision which in fact was made for them by their parents.  Although they
received other benefits
in various forms, and with various continuing effects,
the most substantial provision which was made for their maintenance and
advancement
was that they were given shareholdings in Expressway Spares and
interests in the residuary estate.  That provision would be adequate
in
accordance with the family's standards and circumstances if they were able
actually to enjoy the economic benefit, and is inadequate
only in respect of
obstacles to their doing so.  In my opinion each of the plaintiffs would be
well provided for if their shareholdings
in Expressway Spares and the
discretionary trust were freed from the influence of conflict and hostility,
and business decisions
relating to conduct of business, dividends and otherwise
in company and family affairs were fairly based on genuine pursuit of the
interests of the company, its members as a whole, and of the family.  The
closet approach to this ideal outcome which it is practical
to achieve is that
a majority should be given control over decisions.
<P>

44  	The obstacles are that Claude and Anne-Marie, who have behaved
with active hostility towards the plaintiffs (and the converse
is also true)
are in a position to control the affairs of Expressway Spares by use of the
voting power of the testatrix' shares,
and in that way they can directly or
indirectly control decisions about whether or not there should be any
dividends, the amounts
which should be distributed, whether or not Expressway
Spares' business should continue to be operated by the company or should be
sold, whether or not the proceeds of any sale should be distributed to
shareholders; and any other significant decision relating
to Expressway Spares.
The provision which ought to be made by the Court's order should prevent Claude
and Anne-Marie from using that
voting power except in accordance with the
wishes of the majority of the children of the testatrix, and should limit in a
similar
way their discretionary powers over the residuary trust fund.  The
limitation should be that they should be required to cast votes
and exercise
their powers in accordance with the written direction of a majority of the
children of the testatrix, and that they
be disabled from doing those things
except in accordance with such a written direction.  Otherwise, in my judgment
the Court should
not order any provision under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7.</a>
<P>

45  	As Claude and Anne-Marie have given guarantees to Expressway
Spares' bank for credit to it, it will be a condition of relief
that each of
the plaintiffs give a corresponding guarantee and incur an equal liability with
them; unless some arrangements can be
made under which Claude and Anne-Marie
are released from their guarantee obligation. 
<P>

46  	I have not yet considered questions of the costs of these
proceedings.  I make the following orders:
