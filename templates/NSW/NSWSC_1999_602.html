<b>3083/97 - CHRISTINE STELZER  v  DOUGLAS MCDONALD</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b> </b>This is an application made by Christine Stelzer,
the plaintiff in these proceedings, by way of Statement of Claim filed on 3
July
1997.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff seeks a declaration pursuant to<b> s 56 of
the De Facto Relationships Act 1984</b> that the de facto relationship existed
between 11 August 1989 and 2 January 1996, a period of some six years and five
months or so.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff also seeks an order pursuant to s 20 of the
Act that she be declared the beneficial owner of 117 Holt Road, Taren
Point.
<P>

4   	Additionally the plaintiff seeks an order for a payment out
of a joint account of the plaintiff and the defendant of an amount
of $100,000
representing, she claims, her direct and indirect financial contributions to,
as it is put in the Statement of Claim,
"the de facto relationship".
<P>

5   	There is then an order for return of some furniture and an
alternative plea that a declaration be made pursuant to the terms
of s 17 (2)
(b) (i) of the De Facto Relationships Act, ("the Act").
<P>

6   	The defendant to the proceedings, Douglas Raymond McDonald,
defends this action.  He denies the existence of the de facto relationship
for
the substantial part of the period that the plaintiff claims, admits to a de
facto relationship between January 1995 and January
1996 and then seeks by way
of cross-claim an order pursuant to s 20 of the De Facto Relationships Act that
the plaintiff pay to him
an amount totalling $320,000.  He also seeks the
charging of the property at 117 Holt Road.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff is represented in these proceedings by Ms
Heath of counsel and the defendant is represented by Mr Todd of counsel.
The
hearing took place before me on 2, 3, 4 and 7 June 1999. 
<P>

<b>Parties and their History</b>
<P>

8   	The plaintiff first met the defendant in 1970 when they
were involved with mutual friends. The plaintiff was then 19 and the
defendant
was 25. They had a platonic relationship  during the period 1970 to 1974.
Between 1967 and 1973 the plaintiff was in what
she has described as an
intimate relationship with Frank Stelzer. That relationship apparently finished
in 1973, although it is not
clear of the circumstance of the termination of
that relationship.
<P>

9   	In 1974 the plaintiff lost contact with the defendant in
these proceedings when she became an air hostess or  flight attendant
with
TAA.
<P>

10   	In 1975 the plaintiff once again met up with the defendant
and at that time commenced an intimate relationship with him. It
is not clear
to me on the evidence when that relationship commenced but in any event there
is no issue between the parties that that
was a close and intimate
relationship.
<P>

11   	In 1975 the plaintiff travelled to Singapore with friends,
relevantly one Ms Althea Seagar and in Singapore met up with some
friends and
apparently Ms Seagar's parents. It was in Singapore that the plaintiff met up
again with Mr Stelzer at which time the
relationship that she had enjoyed with
him between 1967 and 1973 was recommenced.
<P>

12   	In 1975 on her return to Australia from holidays the
plaintiff informed the defendant that she had decided to terminate her
relationship with him and, although it is not expressly stated, it is clear
that the defendant was aware that the plaintiff had chosen
Mr Stelzer as an
intimate partner instead of him. Indeed, the evidence discloses that the
defendant was somewhat persistent and questioned
the plaintiff as to whether
she had in fact made the right choice. In any event, it is apparent that the
plaintiff was clear in her
mind as she married Mr Stelzer in 1976 and in that
marriage a daughter, Bree, was born in about 1983 or 1984.
<P>

13   	That relationship apparently soured and ended in January
1989. In July 1989 the plaintiff telephoned the defendant and asked
him whether
he would accompany her to a dinner as her partner. At that time, in July 1989,
the plaintiff was living with her daughter
at premises at 33 Griffiths Street,
Sans Souci. The defendant was living at 155 Holt Road, Taren Point.
<P>

14   	The defendant had purchased 155 Holt Street around 1980.
A photograph of the property is in evidence.  It was a weatherboard,
timber
property with a street frontage and to the lay eye a fairly plain cottage, the
size of which is difficult to tell from the
photograph.
<P>

15   	There is nothing of great detail to assist me as to the
nature of the plaintiff's premises at 33 Griffiths Street at that
time,
although it is clear that the premises had a pool and some outdoor area. It is
also apparent that these premises were of a
timber construction, at least in
part.
<P>

16   	On 11 August 1989 the plaintiff and the defendant
apparently attended that dinner together to which the plaintiff had invited
the
defendant. It is from this date  that the plaintiff alleges the de facto
relationship commenced. The defendant denies that.
<P>

17   	It is clear that between 1989 and 1996, with some detail
of some parting of the ways during that period to which I will refer,
a
relationship of sorts was in place between the plaintiff and defendant.  The
versions of the plaintiff and the defendant differ
in some important aspects in
relation to the nature of their relationship but it is clear that they were in
a relationship from about
1989 to 1996. 
<P>

18   	It is clear between January 1989 and about the middle of
1990 the plaintiff was settling her property settlement and final
separation
and divorce from Mr Stelzer. That property settlement apparently was finalised
in 1990 when the plaintiff received her
former husband's share of the house in
33 Griffiths Street, together with a cash payment. That cash payment was
somewhere around
$80,000 or $90,000 but the plaintiff denied it would be
$100,000. Additionally the plaintiff received a form of payment from the
former
husband in respect of the care of their daughter, Bree.  It is apparent this
was about $110, although the period during which
that was paid is not clear
from the evidence.
<P>

19   	The plaintiff and the defendant continued their
relationship in 1990 and in 1991 they went together and with Bree on a holiday
to Fiji.  This is a matter of some importance, to which I will refer in due
course. The relationship continued until 1994 when the
plaintiff and the
defendant decided to purchase a property together and develop it.
<P>

20   	In June 1994 they purchased the property known as 117 Holt
Road, Taren Point. After it was purchased the defendant cleaned
it up and the
property was rented for some months. In all of this period the plaintiff had
continued to live in her home at 33 Griffiths
Street and the defendant had kept
his home at 155 Holt Road. In late 1994 the plaintiff sold 33 Griffiths Street
and moved into 155
Holt Road on 14 January 1995 with her daughter, Bree.
<P>

21   	When the parties purchased 117 Holt Road the plaintiff
contributed $91,842 and the defendant contributed $275,659. When the
plaintiff
sold her home at Griffiths Street she received a net figure of $400,515 and
shortly after settlement on 25 January 1995,deposited
the money into six
separate St George interest bearing deposit accounts. The accounts were in the
name of Classic Developments Pty
Ltd. That was the defendant's company which
was a vehicle for the development of the property and apparently a vehicle for
him to
carry out his profession or trade as a builder in which he had been
since aged 16 and his skills in that regard are obvious and I
shall refer to
them in due course.
<P>

22   	In 1995 the cash contributions of the parties were such
that the plaintiff had contributed a portion of the amounts in the
interest
bearing deposit accounts to a total figure of $391,184 and at the end of the
development the defendant had contributed cash
of something in the order of
$299,000.
<P>

23   	The rental that was received for the property prior to its
development is said to be somewhere in the vicinity of  $4,000
odd and the
interest received on the interest bearing deposits is said to be in the amount
of some nearly $16,000. 
<P>

24   	The plan seems to have differed between the plaintiff and
the defendant but, putting to one side their differences, it is
clear that the
development of 117 Holt Road took place in 1995, in the main between May and
November.
<P>

25   	There was some evidence about a Local Environment Plan
having some impact on the premises so that a two storey house was built
at the
street frontage and a single storey dwelling in the battle axe block with a
right of  carriageway from the street to that
back block. The construction was
completed in November 1995 and it is clear that at about that time the parties
had begun to experience
some deep problems in their relationship, so much so
that they parted, separating on 2 January 1996.
<P>

26   	On 14 December 1995 the two storey dwelling known as 117
Holt Road was transferred to the plaintiff. The transfer indicates
that the
consideration for this transfer was for $1. It is clear that the plaintiff
moved into those premises in 1996, she having
lived with her father and her
daughter at his home for some period after the initial separation on 2 January
1996.
<P>

27   	On 1 March 1996 the single storey dwelling, 117A Holt
Road, was sold for an amount of $380,985. Those proceeds were placed
into a
joint account and $200,000 has been paid out to the defendant in June 1998, the
balance of approximately $243,000 remains
in the account.
<P>

28   	At the time of the trial before me the plaintiff was
living in 117 Holt Road, the defendant was living in 155 Holt Road and
the
joint account remained at approximately $243,000.
<P>

<b>The Law</b>
<P>

29   	Section 17 of the Act precludes a Court from making an
order under Pt 3 (Proceedings for Financial Adjustment) unless the
Court is
satisfied that the parties to the application have lived together in a de facto
relationship for a period of not less than
two years. If the Court is satisfied
that the relationship subsisted for two years or more then the Court may make
an order under
s 20 adjusting the interests of the parties in the property. The
Court may adjust those interests as to it seems just and equitable
and it does
so having regard to the matters identified in s 20 (1)(a) and (b).  Importantly
the Court has regard to the financial
and non-financial contributions made
directly or indirectly to the acquisition, the conservation or the improvement
of any of the
de facto property or the acquisition, conservation or improvement
of financial resources of the partners, or either of them.  The
Court also has
regard to the contributions, including any contributions made in the capacity
of homemaker or made by either of the
partners to the welfare of the other
partner or to the welfare of the family constituted by the partnership. 
<P>

30   	Even if the Court is  not satisfied that the de facto
relationship endured for a period of two years then it is able to make
an order
adjusting the interests of the partners in the property if it is satisfied that
an applicant has made substantial contributions
of the kind referred to in s
20, to which I have just referred.
<P>

31   	I have been helpfully referred to the authorities in
relation to the approach to be adopted by the Court which supports the
approach
that it would be unrealistic to attempt to evaluate the contributions of the
kind to which I have just referred for the
purposes of determining what is just
and equitable by having regard to those contributions in isolation from the
nature and the incidents
of the relationship as a whole.
<P>

32   	In<b> Evans v Marmont <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a></b> the Court
adopted the approach to which I have just referred and suggested that relevant
aspects of the relationship, that is its
nature and incidents, may well include
matters to which Hodgson J (as he then was), had referred in<b> Dwyer v
Kaljo</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20Fam%20LR%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 Fam LR 785</a> at 793<b>.</b>
<P>

33   	The matters to which Hodgson J referred included the
financial circumstances of the parties, the property at the time of the
hearing, the needs and the means of the parties, although his Honour was very
careful to highlight that the relevance of that factor
had only a general
relevance to the process of answering the question which was posed, what is
just and equitable having regard to
the plaintiff's contributions?
<P>

34   	His Honour also referred to factors such as the length of
the relationship, any proposal or expectation of marriage and opportunities
lost by the plaintiff's contributions.
<P>

35   	It is clear that no particular limit can be set upon the
considerations but in determining this matter the Court is clearly
exercising a
judicial discretion and it has been said it must be exercised solely on the
basis of one, the respective contributions
of the parties and two, in the light
of such other circumstances as might properly be regarded as relevant and which
seek to produce
a result which, in all the circumstances of the case, is just
and equitable. 
<P>

36   	The Court is required to identify and value the property
of the parties to determine whether any and if so what contributions
have been
made by each partner and determine firstly, whether in all the circumstances of
the case the contributions of the applicant
have already been sufficiently
recognised and compensated for and secondly, what, if any, order is called for
in order that the applicant's
contributions be sufficiently recognised and
compensated for. <b> </b>(<b>Hayes v Jones, Court of Appeal, unreported,
Powell, Beazley and Stein JJ, Butterworths Unreported Judgments at pp 6 and
7</b>)
<P>

37   	So, I must approach this task as is required in line with
<b>Evans v Marmont</b> in a realistic way and not in isolation from the nature
and the incidents of the relationship of the parties.
<P>

<b>De Facto Relationship</b>
<P>

38   	This brings me to the first matter about which there is
rather a large issue and that is whether the de facto relationship
existed
between August 1989 and January 1996, or some other time.
<P>

39   	Each element of a relationship, of course, needs to be
assessed realistically and it has been said that each element draws
its colour
and its significance from other elements and what must be looked at is a
composite picture. It has been suggested also
that any attempt to isolate
individual factors and attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or
importance involves a denial
of common experience and will inevitably lead into
error; see<b> Linham v Director General Social Security  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20Fam%20LR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">9 Fam LR 305</a> at
307</b>.
<P>

40   	It is obviously a question of fact and degree in
determining whether the parties have been living as "husband and wife" as
facets of their interpersonal relationship need to be taken into account.
Although the financial relationship is important it is
only one of a number of
relevant matters. It seems to me that <b>Evans v Marmont</b> has gathered
together all these concepts in its approach to a realistic assessment of
relationships when applications are made under
this Act.
<P>

41   	The defendant concedes that there was a de facto
relationship between January 1995 and January 1996. In August 1989 it is
apparent that the plaintiff worked for Air New Zealand at the airport. She
worked shift work which enabled her to earn penalties.
 The early shift ran
from 6am to 11am, or about midday and the late shift commenced at 1pm and would
finish no earlier than 6pm.
 The plaintiff said she would arrive home sometimes
as late as 7.30pm or 8pm and sometimes later but it really depended upon
whether
the Air New Zealand flights were delayed. There is no evidence before
me as to the frequency or otherwise of delays of the Air New
Zealand flights.
There is some evidence that the latest scheduled departure of a flight when the
plaintiff was on late shift was
about 6pm.
<P>

42   	When the plaintiff rang the defendant in July 1989 she
said to him, "Would you like to attend a dinner with me as my partner?",
and he
agreed. She was aware at the time that she spoke to him that he had been and
was at that time conducting his own building
business and he was aware that she
worked for Air New Zealand.
<P>

43   	The defendant says that he attended a dinner with the
plaintiff on 11 August and after that dinner, as he put it, "We ended
up at my
house with two of the plaintiff's friends." It is apparent from his evidence
that the friends left in the early hours of
the morning and that he and the
plaintiff went to bed together at his house and spent the rest of the weekend
at his house because
Bree was visiting her father, who apparently had access
every second weekend.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff's evidence in her first statement was that
she and the defendant commenced living together from that date in
her home at
33 Griffiths Street, Sans Souci. Of that evidence the defendant says:
<P>

"After being together for about one week I was not interested in shacking-up
with her after she dumped me years before and she just
split up from a bad
marriage."
<P>

45   	The plaintiff told the defendant that when her mother
stayed overnight to mind her daughter when the plaintiff was on early
shift she
did not appreciate the defendant staying overnight with the plaintiff. The
defendant said that the plaintiff told him,
"Mum frowns on that sort of thing".
When the plaintiff's mother stayed overnight the defendant would go home when
the plaintiff went
to bed. There is no issue between the parties that the
sexual relationship commenced in August 1989.
<P>

46   	The defendant also gave evidence that he stayed overnight
with the plaintiff on many occasions but his version was that he
usually ate
his dinner at his own home before he went to the plaintiff's premises at night.
He said that it was his habit to go to
work during the day and because of the
nature of his work he would return home and have a shower and then he would
ring the plaintiff
later on in the evening and go over to her place, stay the
night and then return in the morning and go off to work.
<P>

47   	There was an issue between the parties as to who cooked
dinner and where each of the parties ate dinner. There is no doubt
that the
plaintiff cooked meals for the defendant. There is no doubt that the defendant
took the plaintiff out to dinner, it seems
on numerous occasions. The
regularity of the parties going out to dinner, is not so clear but it is
apparent that it occurred once
a week at the club, or a good restaurant
depending upon the circumstances. The plaintiff's version was that it was less
frequent
than once per week. Bree liked going to a restaurant chain known as
Sizzler but the defendant became irritated with having to stand
in line at
those restaurants and so other choices were made, which included a local
club.
<P>

48   	In any event, no matter what the frequency, it is clear
that although the defendant maintained his home at 155 Holt Road and
the
plaintiff maintained her home at 33 Griffiths Street, they spent a lot of time
together.
<P>

49   	In 1991 they decided to go for a holiday to Fiji, to which
I have referred earlier. In that respect the plaintiff gave evidence
that that
holiday occurred between 18 March and 25 March. The plaintiff said that at that
time she was, employed at Air New Zealand
and was able to obtain a discount
from the airline for that holiday. She told me that the discounted airfares are
available for staff
and their family members.
<P>

50   	Annexed to her first statement were two documents.  A
statutory declaration declared on 17 November 1994:
<P>

"Christine Stelzer of 33 Griffiths Street, Sans Souci solemnly and sincerely
declares as follows: Douglas Raymond McDonald is my
de facto spouse and has
been residing at the above address since 1989."
<P>

51   	Another annexure dated 19 February 1991 is more pertinent
to the Fiji trip. It is a memorandum from the plaintiff to the Personnel
Administration Manager of Air New Zealand in which the plaintiff said: 
<P>

"I wish to nominate my de facto spouse Douglas Raymond McDonald for staff
travel.  Please refer to enclosed bank statement as proof
of my
relationship."
<P>

52   	The plaintiff went on to note that the other nominee was
her father and asked the administration to amend their documents
appropriately.
<P>

53   	The defendant said that he paid for the fare and all
accommodation and meal expenses for himself, for the plaintiff and for
her
daughter.  He said the plaintiff had told him that there were several ways in
which it was possible to obtain discounted airfares.
He said that the plaintiff
told him the first was if there was a de facto relationship and the second was
if there was a joint bank
account. He could not remember the other ways that
the plaintiff had told him it was possible to achieve a discounted airfare for
him. He said that he had never seen the correspondence dated 19 February 1991
which the plaintiff annexed to her statement, nor had
he seen the statutory
declaration of 1994.  The plaintiff proceeded to  obtain the discount for Mr
McDonald on the basis that he
was effectively part of a family set up with her
which would entitle him to the benefit of a discounted fare.
<P>

54   	This matter was raised with the defendant in evidence and
is the subject of a certificate pursuant to<b> s 128 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.
The defendant said that he understood that the plaintiff was putting him
forward as her de facto and he was happy for her to do
that. He said "in the
context that I was getting the cheap fare". When asked whether he would lie to
Air New Zealand to obtain the
benefit he said, "in this case I guess I did, or
allowed her to".
<P>

55   	The defendant was asked some further questions about that
matter and said that he didn't consider that the plaintiff could
have lost her
job if a lie was told.  As to whether such conduct of telling a lie to obtain a
financial benefit might expose him
to criminal proceedings he said:
<P>

"I may have been aware of it but it wasn't a consideration. I never thought
along those lines about it at all."
<P>

56   	The plaintiff relies heavily on this evidence of the
defendant allowing her to put him forward as her de facto to obtain a
benefit
and suggests that the material before me should persuade me that the defendant
ought be estopped from denying that the relationship
was in place as and from
1991.
<P>

57   	I regard the matter as a little more complex than the
Elias principle to which Ms Heath referred me in<b> In the Marriage of
Jordan</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FamCA/1996/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FamCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2021%20Fam%20LR%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 21 Fam LR 382.</a> In the line of authority referred to in that
case the Court was concerned with parties who had in fact split their income
for taxation
purposes.  Declarations had been made to the Commissioner for
Taxation in respect of tax in respect of wives' income and also in
respect of
property being placed in the name of one spouse or another.
<P>

58   	What Mr McDonald said in his statement was that the two
issues that the plaintiff had informed him about were one, being a
de facto or
two, having a joint bank account. There is no doubt that the parties opened a
joint bank account into which they placed
about $50 and it remained moribund
thereafter.
<P>

59   	The need to assess the nature of the relationship between
these two people is more complicated, although a feature of that
assessment
will include the fact that the defendant did allow the plaintiff to obtain what
is known as an ID 90 airfare, which is
a payment of 10 per cent, for him to
Fiji. However I am not satisfied that the defendant is estopped from denying
that his relationship
with the plaintiff was not a de facto relationship in
1991.
<P>

60   	There is no doubt that the plaintiff believed what she was
saying and any suggestion that she had obtained anything from Air
New Zealand
in an other than honest way has no foundation, indeed such an allegation has
not been made in these proceedings.
<P>

61   	The relationship between the parties included the
defendant assisting the plaintiff at her premises in a way that the plaintiff
says should convince me that they were in a de facto relationship. Mr McDonald
admits that he did quite a deal around the home and
in para 41 of his statement
filed on 30 March he sets out in detail a number of the things that he did for
the plaintiff whilst she
was living at Sans Souci. As sometimes occurs in these
matters great detail has been gone into as to whether each of the matters
in
that list actually occurred, how many times he mowed the lawns, the number of
occasions he varnished outdoor settings, whether
he stained certain timbers on
the house or cleaned the gutters and the like. On the one hand the defendant
was stating he carried
out these activities and on the other the plaintiff was
suggesting that he did less than he claimed.  The parties are peculiarly
turned
about.  The plaintiff wants to rely on the fact that the defendant carried out
these activities to prove the existence of
a de facto relationship but to deny
their existence in proving her contributions.  The defendant on the other hand
wants to rely
on the activities as contribution but to dilute their affect on
the de facto relationship aspect of the case. 
<P>

62   	Be that as it may, it is obvious that the defendant did
assist around the house at 33 Griffiths Street.  Additionally the
plaintiff
says that the nature of the relationship was such that the defendant assisted
her father in renovating his home and it
is clear that the defendant did assist
Mr Dovey, the plaintiff's father, who was called in these proceedings.
<P>

63   	It is also clear that the defendant and Mr Dovey had a
good relationship. The nature of the relationship between the defendant
and the
plaintiff's mother is not so clear and the relationship between the plaintiff
and the defendant's mother, who sadly died
in August 1994, was also clearly of
one of mutual liking and the plaintiff attended her in hospital on a number of
occasions.
<P>

64   	In any event, the plaintiff points to these factors to
suggest to me that as early as 1991, indeed in 1989, the de facto relationship
existed. It is common ground that the defendant had an excellent relationship
with the plaintiff's daughter Bree. Some detail of
that relationship appears in
para 43 of the defendant's statement filed on 30 March 1998. There is no doubt
that the defendant was
generous, indeed very generous not only with his money
but his time. That, says the plaintiff, should convince me that it was a de
facto relationship.
<P>

65   	The parties had an argument in 1991 around the time of the
plaintiff's 40th birthday.  On the one hand the plaintiff says
they were parted
for about three weeks or so and on the other the defendant claims a much longer
period of some six or seven months.
However, in his oral evidence the defendant
seemed to concede that it was less than seven months they would have been apart
but suggested
it was about from September 1991 through to about January
1992.
<P>

66   	It was obvious that the plaintiff was going to have a
party for her 40th birthday and the defendant had planned a party for
her.
Those plans went awry at the time of the argument and the plaintiff did not
attend the 40th birthday party, which apparently
took place on a friend's boat.
It has been suggested to the defendant in cross-examination that his version of
this separation is
exaggerated and a number of aspects and incidents of being
together with the plaintiff during that period were put to him. The defendant
denied a number of them and conceded that he went to a mutual friend of his
mother's on Christmas day but said the plaintiff was
not there.
<P>

67   	There is no doubt in my mind that the parties had an
argument, the defendant referring to it effectively as a "tiff". There
is also
no doubt in my mind that they did not communicate with each other for at least
three weeks. I was impressed by the way the
defendant suggested he got back
together with the plaintiff, as it seemed to me to have some truthful ring
about it. He said he was
up the coast visiting some friends and with a smile
told me "I thought I might just drop in". That seemed to me to suggest that he
decided he wanted to get back together with the plaintiff.  And so the
relationship continued once again with him keeping his home
in 155 Holt Road
and the plaintiff keeping her home at 33 Griffiths Street.
<P>

68   	The parties attended a counsellor and the issue of what
was said by the counsellor was somewhat controversial.  It had been
objected to
by Mr Todd as being inadmissible on a policy ground because what had been said
was confidential between the parties and
the counsellor. I ruled against Mr
Todd in the circumstances of this case and allowed the evidence to be given.
Ultimately, however,
it didn't seem to me that it helped very much in the
assessment of either party's case.
<P>

69   	The statement that was made to the counsellor seems to
have been that the parties were living in separate houses. The reason
for going
to the counsellor, put forward by the plaintiff, was that the defendant was
experiencing some problems in his relationship
with Bree at that time. The
defendant said that when the counsellor heard they were living separately she
appeared to lose interest.
<P>

70   	Another factor that to which Hodgson J referred to which I
may have regard in this respect is the question of the expectation
of marriage.
It seems to me that this aspect of the parties' relationship may be a key. It
is apparent that  the defendant asked
the plaintiff to marry him when they were
together in 1975, or thereabouts, and he was rebuffed. The defendant says that
when they
started the relationship in 1989 and to the time that they parted
marriage was not discussed. The plaintiff on the other hand says
that it was
discussed.
<P>

71   	Originally she said that it was discussed in this way; she
said:
<P>

" Late in 1989 the defendant said to me words to the effect  'I am not going to
ask you to marry me again now but if that's what
you want we'll get
married.'"
<P>

72   	She then said on another occasion, although the date was
not clear from her statement, that the defendant said to her, "maybe
we'll get
married when we get our waterfront dream home".
<P>

73   	When she gave her evidence before me in the trial the
plaintiff said:
<P>

"We discussed it and he said that we would get married once we moved into the
waterfront house."
<P>

That was on the first day of the hearing at p 9 of the transcript.
<P>

74   	In her case in reply the plaintiff was cross-examined on
this topic by Mr Todd and she gave this evidence (p240):
<P>

"Q.  Can you say at this point in time when it was if at all during the 1989 to
1995, January 95 period, that you stated to Mr McDonald
unequivocally that you
would marry him, did that occur?
<P>

A.  No.  The reason that I would not accept to get married before was because I
didn't want my daughter's name to change and it
would have been difficult for
her in school if I had a different surname.  That was the only reason."
<P>

75   	She was then asked about being able to get married and not
changing her name.  Although she agreed with that possibility she
said that
there would still be a difficulty. She was then asked (p241):
<P>

" Q.  The position was you had not committed yourself to marriage with Mr
McDonald prior to 1995, had you?
<P>

A.  I thought we would eventually get married."
<P>

76   	Originally the plaintiff was tentative but later  became
firmer with the statement:  "we would get married when we moved into
our
waterfront home".
<P>

77   	The mention of the waterfront home is a reference to a
plan the plaintiff said she and the defendant had of a dream home on
the
waterfront.  It seems the plaintiff fixed the time for marriage as the moving
into the waterfront home and yet she expressed
concern about her daughter and
schooling. It seems to me that the plaintiff's expressed opinion that:  "I
thought we would eventually
get married" is the true position about this
relationship. In my view there was some reticence in both parties in
approaching the
subject of and commitment to marriage by reason of their
history;  the defendant, having been rebuffed in 1975, and the plaintiff
having
suffered an unsatisfactory break-up of her first marriage.
<P>

78   	The parties had separate homes and separate bank accounts.
The plaintiff accepted that the defendant would ring her at night
before coming
around. She said in her evidence in respect of the shift work that "we would
eat together after he rang me and came
over for the evening". It seems to me
that there was a separateness to their lifestyle and that separateness was
precipitated by
each of their reticent approaches to committing themselves to a
long term marriage-type relationship. But in 1994 they became closer.
<P>

79   	Between March and May and it is not clear specifically
when, the parties decided to purchase a property together. That was
117 Holt
Road. It is clear that the plaintiff had money in an account apparently
available from her property settlement from Mr Stelzer.
Before I deal finally
with the purchase of 117 Holt Road it is important to refer to one other aspect
on which the plaintiff relies
and that is the suggestion that the defendant by
his conduct with her former husband made it clear that the relationship was one
of a de facto kind.
<P>

80   	The ex-husband, Mr Stelzer, had apparently adopted an
attitude that he could visit the house at 33 Griffiths Street, Sans
Souci at
any time he liked. This was apparently unsettling for the plaintiff. She
informed the defendant of this and the defendant
told the plaintiff that he
should be telephoned next time the ex-husband came around and the defendant
would deal with it. It is
clear that the defendant assisted in this regard by
informing Mr Stelzer that perhaps a little more discretion had to be exercised,
to use a neutral term, in his visitations to the house. The plaintiff says that
the defendant told the ex-husband that he was now
in charge.  The plaintiff
relies on this approach as a factor going to the establishment of a de facto
relationship. I have taken
that into account in making the assessment of this
matter.
<P>

81   	I should now return then to 1994 when the parties
purchased 117 Holt Road. It was at that time that the plaintiff contributed
$91,000 odd to the purchase of that home.
<P>

82   	These circumstances in which the plaintiff and the
defendant find themselves it seems are exquisitely uncomfortable. Neither
of
them has much good to say of the other party at the moment because of their
bitterness. However, there are some features in their
evidence which suggest
that they still have a respect for each other in some regards.
<P>

83   	In these circumstances therefore it is difficult for the
parties to assess the situation objectively because that bitterness
permeates
the atmosphere. It is therefore important to look to other evidence which may
assist in the assessment of the respective
claims.
<P>

84   	The plaintiff's father Mr William Dovey who gave evidence
impressed me as an extremely honest, caring father. He was  very
matter of fact
about his observation of his daughter in her relationship with Mr McDonald and
told me that he thought the relationship
was somewhat volatile. He did not ever
hear the plaintiff referred to by the defendant as his "better half",
notwithstanding the
fact that the plaintiff had suggested that was the way the
defendant referred to her. The plaintiff makes the point, however, that
he
would not have referred to her as his "better half" in front of a parent.
<P>

85   	There was then the evidence of Ms Seagar, the friend of
the plaintiff's with whom she went to Singapore in 1975.  It is obvious
they
have maintained their friendly relationship over the years since that time.
The affect of Ms Seagar's evidence was that there
was animosity between her and
the defendant.  She told me she would wait down the street until the defendant
left before she would
go into 33 Griffiths Street. She said that the defendant
had a particular attitude to the plaintiff's friends and that was known
amongst
a group of friends.
<P>

86   	That does not seem to assist the plaintiff, however. It
seems to me that if the plaintiff has to be telephoned to make a time
to see
her friends when the defendant is not there, it may militate against a de facto
relationship being in place. On the other
hand, it is relied upon by the
plaintiff I presume to show that she was restricted in her friendships.  
<P>

87   	A more neutral witness was Mrs Ford who was a neighbour of
the plaintiff for some time when she lived in 33 Griffiths Street.
Mrs Ford
said she did not have much to do socially with the plaintiff and defendant
between 1989 and 1992 but from 1992 and onwards
they began to socialise more
often. In the period that she has known the parties they have only been out to
restaurants three or
four times and she very honestly conceded that she was
pretty busy with her four young children and perhaps did not have a great
deal
of time to socialise or to attend to the observation of the couple, as she
called them, on a regular basis.  However, she did
have some significant
evidence to give in assisting me in respect of what seems to me to be a vexed
question for these parties. She
was told by the plaintiff that she was going to
sell her home which sale occurred in December 1994.  Mrs Ford said:
<P>

"Chris (the plaintiff) explained to me that she was selling her house as a
commitment to their relationship and that was the only
reason she would embark
on that because I asked her why she would sell her house and she said 'I have
been with him now for four
years, I mean it is now or never'."
<P>

88   	As with most things in this case the plaintiff relies on
it for one purpose and the defendant for another.
<P>

89   	The plaintiff says that she is entitled to have that
evidence weighed in her favour, whereas the defendant says that this
is an
indication that it was only from this time that the plaintiff had decided to
commit herself to this relationship with an intermingling
of finances, with the
selling of her home, with the commitment to what he admits occurred in January
1995, a de facto relationship.
<P>

90   	In all the circumstances I think it occurred earlier than
the sale of the plaintiff's home. It has been difficult  to assess
this matter
because of the varying versions given by the plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

91   	It is said on behalf of the defendant that I should have
some reservation about the plaintiff's evidence and conclude that
she has
exaggerated the nature of the relationship. It is submitted that that
reservation springs from some evidence that was given
in reply when the
plaintiff was cross-examined about the finding of some cash in the defendant's
mother's home after she demised.
That occurred in August 1994 and in cleaning
out the house and arranging the defendant's mother's affairs Mr Dovey assisted
the defendant
and the plaintiff.
<P>

92   	The plaintiff was originally cross-examined in her case in
chief and told me that she was not aware that some $27,000 in cash
had been
found in the defendant's mother's home. She was asked (p37B): 
<P>

"Q.  Madam, she had cash within the home which you and Mr McDonald and your
father located at the time of clearing out the residence
of (her)  chattels and
effects, didn't you?
<P>

A.  No.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  Are you seriously saying there was no money there?
<P>

A.  There was a little bit of money in her handbags which I gave to Doug.
<P>

 
<P>

Q.  I want to suggest to you that the amount that was in the home in cash in
various forms, in envelopes and the like about the
house, totalled some
$27,000?
<P>

A.  I don't know."
<P>

93   	When the plaintiff was cross-examined yesterday in her
case in reply she conceded that Mr McDonald had told her that there
was $30,000
at the time in the defendant's mother's home.
<P>

94   	Mr Todd suggested to the plaintiff that she had been
caught out in failing to tell the Court the truth on her first occasion
in the
witness box. The plaintiff's explanation for not mentioning that the defendant
had told her about the money was that she did
not believe that the defendant's
mother could have had that much cash there and therefore she did not know
whether it was really
found and therefore I should not draw any adverse
inference from the apparent difference in her evidence on the two occasions.
<P>

95   	The defendant relies on the plaintiff's father's evidence
which was that he did find an envelope lodged between some furniture
at the
defendant's mother's home and gave that envelope to the plaintiff to give to
the defendant with instructions "don't count
it, give it to Doug", or words to
that effect. It seems to me that the evidence is curious and this is a matter I
raised with Ms
Heath of counsel. Ms Heath's response was very persuasive, I
must say.  In terms it was suggested to me by Ms Heath that what the
plaintiff
was really referring to was something different from what Mr McDonald had told
her.  In other words, the plaintiff was
focused upon her belief that it could
not be the case that that much money was in the house and belonged to the
defendant's mother.
I have to say, however, I still have a feeling of unease
about it as it seems to me that the time  for disclosing what was disclosed
in
cross-examination on 7 June at between pp 226 and 230 was long before that when
the plaintiff was asked originally about this
cash.
<P>

96   	The defendant suggests I should have some doubt about the
plaintiff's version of events.
<P>

97   	It is at this stage that I return to the promotion of the
defendant by the plaintiff as her de facto to obtain the ID 90 fare
to Fiji.
<P>

98   	It is probably not an appropriate judicial approach to say
one cancels out the other but I have to say that I have some disquiet
about
each of the plaintiff and the defendant in respect of their approach to their
evidence. If the defendant was willing to let
the plaintiff lie and the
plaintiff was willing not to tell me about the cash when an occasion clearly
called for it, it seems I
should approach their versions with some reservation
on both sides.
<P>

99   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff did enter into a de
facto relationship with the defendant in about March 1994 when she decided
to
intermingle her finances with him and firmly make a commitment later that year.
It seems to me that the overt commitment to that
relationship occurred in late
1994 when the plaintiff decided to sell her home as evidenced in the
conversation with Mrs Ford.  I
am of the view that the plaintiff must have been
of the view that she was willing to take the extra step in about April, May
1994
when the parties decided to purchase 117 Holt Road.
<P>

100   	I have taken into account the very helpful submissions of
the plaintiff's counsel and notwithstanding the detail of the nature
of the
relationship between the two parties during the period prior to May 1994, the
separateness of their lives in important respects
including keeping their
premises separate, keeping their finances separate from each other until 1994
leads me to the conclusion
that the relationship was not a de facto
relationship until April 1994.
<P>

<b>S.17 of the Act</b>
<P>

101   	It is therefore important to assess what it is that I am
to do, having regard to the prohibition in s 17 (1). It is obvious
that the
plaintiff has made a very large contribution, both financial and non-financial,
to the property and the financial resources
of the partnership. It is obvious
also that she has made a contribution as a homemaker.  Equally I am satisfied
that the defendant
has made similar contributions, to which I will refer.
<P>

102   	A debate has raged as to what I may take into account in
the circumstances of a finding under s 17(2)(b)(i)  adjusting the
interests of
partners in the property.  This has been the subject of a flurry of submissions
this morning because Mr Todd conceded
yesterday afternoon that I could take pre
de facto relationship matters into account. This morning he submitted that I
could not.
He based this submission on what Powell J said in<b> Roy v Sturgeon
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20Fam%20LR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 Fam LR 271</a></b> particularly at 278;
<P>

"I conclude, therefore, that contrary to the approach taken by the Family Court
of Australia to applications under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act 1975</a> it is not
open to this Court, when dealing with applications under s 20 of the Act, to
have regard to 'contributions' said to have
been made prior to the commencement
of the particular 'de facto relationship'. There is, I believe, no injustice in
this for it would
still remain open to a 'de facto partner' to rely on prior
contributions as supporting a claim under the general law."
<P>

103   	His Honour also revisited this approach in
<b>Theodoropoulos v Theodosiou (1994-95) 19 Fam LR at 632</b>. In that case
there was a reliance on a relationship that had commenced prior to the
enactment of the De Facto Relationships Act
1984 and his Honour was very firm
in his rejection of the entitlement to consider matters prior to the
commencement of the Act. But
his Honour also said at 643:
<P>

"As I sought to point out in Roy v Sturgeon the provisions of s 20 of the Act
differ markedly from the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act 1975</a> (Cth) upon which
the Family Court of Australia has relied when dealing with applications for
settlement of property under s 79(4)
of the Act... and the similar provisions
(in the English Statutes)... upon which the judges of the Family Division of
the High Court
of Justice in England... have relied as a justification for
having regard to any pre-marital cohabitation between the parties to
an
application for a property settlement under the provision of the relevant Act.

<P>

104   	Ms Heath relies on<b> Griffiths v Brodigan (1995-96) 20
Fam LR</b> in which Chisholm J made an assessment of Powell JA's interpretation
of the Act. He took a different view. He said at 834:
<P>

"In my view it is open to the Court in a proper case to have regard to
contributions of the kind mentioned in s 20 notwithstanding
that those
contributions might have been made before or after the period of the de facto
relationship."
<P>

105   	He said that he had two reasons for forming that view.
The first was that it was not expressly limited in the Act and the
second was
that it seemed to him it was not possible for the Court to make an order that
is just and equitable without having regard
to the contributions of the kind
mentioned in s 20 which were made at the time when the parties had a
relationship but one that could
not be characterised as a de facto relationship
under the Act.
<P>

106   	Of course in Roy v Sturgeon<b> </b>Powell JA was dealing
with the relationship prior to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Evans v
Marmont. The plaintiff relies
on Evans v Marmont as suggesting that this
realistic and global approach would allow pre-relationship facts to be taken
into account.
<P>

107   	 Another feature which may be important it seems to me is
the wording of s 15 of the Act which refers to the prerequisite
for making an
order. Specifically in s 15 (1) (b) of the Act there is a requirement that both
parties were residents "for a substantial
period of their de facto
relationship". Section 15(1)(b)(ii), does not refer to any period.  
<P>

108   	Powell JA was dealing with applications under s 20.
Because of my finding this is now an assessment of what adjustments should
be
made because I am satisfied under s 17 (2) (b) (i). It is difficult to settle
this debate particularly when I have regard to Powell
JA's enormous experience
in this field and his very firm view in respect of this matter. Indeed, it will
be recalled that in Theodoropoulos
his Honour was extremely concerned at the
difference that had arisen in Wallace v Stanford  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2019%20Fam%20LR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 19 Fam LR 430</a> and Dwyer
v Kaljo  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20728" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 728</a> and it was his Honour who suggested that the
difference might be cured by Dwyer v Kaljo being re considered, "perhaps by an
enlarged
bench", which of course is exactly what happened.  It is a thorny
problem.
<P>

109   	It seems to me, however, that Evans v Marmont requires me
to be realistic and I don't believe it is appropriate for me to
ignore the
nature of the relationship between the parties and the general contribution
they made to each other by way of conserving
property and financial resources
and by way of homemaking if it occurred prior to the de facto relationship.  In
all the circumstances
of this case I am going to take into account the nature
of the relationship of the parties prior to the de facto relationship in
reaching my conclusion as to what is just and equitable.  It seems to me it
would be unrealistic not to look at it.
<P>

<b>Identification and Valuation of Property</b>
<P>

110   	Returning to what I must do, it is clear that I have to
identify and value the property of the parties as a first step. It
is clear at
the time of trial there was 155 Holt Road, 117 Holt Road and the money in the
bank account which notionally will include
a redeposit of the $200,000 paid to
Mr McDonald last year.
<P>

111   	The parties have each instructed independent expert
valuers to assist the Court in this regard, Mr O'Neill for the plaintiff
and Mr
Tseris for the defendant. In respect of 155 Holt Road it is clear if I make a
comparison between exhibit 3 and Mr O'Neill's
annexure C that Mr McDonald in
fact improved that property markedly. It is obvious that his skills as a
builder have vastly enhanced
that property.   
<P>

112   	 The 155 Holt Road property was lived in by the parties
from January 1995 and during that period the plaintiff contributed
as a
homemaker in caring for the defendant and the defendant contributed in caring
for the plaintiff. There is no doubt about that.
Additionally the family unit
that was a result of the cohabitation was nurtured by each of the plaintiff and
the defendant. Bree,
the plaintiff's daughter, was clearly in a good
relationship with her mother and with the defendant. There was no true
financial
contribution by the plaintiff to that property.  The defendant
renovated, upgraded and obviously took very good care of 155 Holt
Road. It
seems there is no issue between the parties that the defendant is apparently
somewhat fastidious in his cleanliness, particularly
when it comes to the
bathroom and it is apparent the way in which he approaches his work is
consistent with that fastidiousness.
 The plaintiff moved in with the
defendant, as I say, in January 1995 and used her salary to purchase the
household food and goods.
 The defendant paid for everything else.
<P>

113   	The property at 33 Griffiths Street was sold in late
1994. The proceeds of that sale were invested in the joint plan to develop
117
Holt Road and the way in which the plaintiff and defendant approached that
property is a little different. The defendant concedes
that any contribution to
33 Griffiths Street was a fairly conservative contribution by the defendant and
on an assessment of it as
to what he did to improve that property for obtaining
a better sale price is about no more than five per cent.
<P>

114   	Mr Todd sought to put some evidence before me in respect
of the valuation of that property. It was objected to because it
was so late in
the day and I ruled it was inadmissible in the circumstances of the way the
defendant had approached his case and
particularly the way the plaintiff had
approached her case. The plaintiff has not placed before me any valuation of
that property
but there is a reference to the sale price achieved in late
1994.
<P>

115   	The defendant spent at least from May to November 1995 an
average of 11 hours a day working on the 117 Holt Road construction
either on
the site or at home for six days per week. He spent half a day on Sunday but
sometimes a little more depending upon what
needed to be done. The project of
the two storey home and the single storey home was completed in 29 weeks and
that seems to have
been achieved apparently in circumstances where there was
some rainfall.
<P>

116   	The plaintiff has tendered documents from the Bureau of
Meteorology which suggest that from May through to November 1995
there was an
average rainfall in May of 6.4 through to 8.5 in September and 3.7 in November.
I have been asked to take judicial notice
of this document and I have observed
it.  Such judicial notice has its limitation because I quite frankly do not
understand the detail
of the document or its consequences.  However I am
willing to find that there was some rain during the period. That seems to me to
be in the  defendant's favour because notwithstanding that rain he still was
able to achieve the construction of these two homes
within a very short period
having regard to what has been described by the valuers and the quantity
surveyor, as high quality work.
It has been suggested to me that to achieve the
building of one of those homes in that period might have been difficult. So
that
is why I said earlier that I have been impressed with the defendant's
capacity in his profession or trade.
<P>

117   	The two valuers, Mr Tseris and Mr O'Neill, have achieved
a result that is quite interesting. Mr O'Neill values the house
in which the
plaintiff lives at 117 Holt Road at $575,000. He values the defendant's house
at $635,000. Mr Tseris values the plaintiff's
house at $635,000 and the
defendant's house at $575,000. Both of the expert valuers in my view tried
independently to assist me in
respect of the values of these properties. They
were willing to give in respect of some of the propositions that were put to
them
by opposing counsel and it seems to me that both men honestly formed their
views and reasonably formed their views with the subjective
element that each
of them admits must be involved in this process.
<P>

118   	Ms Heath suggests that Mr O'Neill should be preferred
because he used a check method.  Mr Tseris explained that the check
method
should not be something that would convince me that his method was not just as
good as Mr O'Neill's. The methods they used
were the recent sales.  Mr O'Neill
used land value and his check method additional to the recent sales.
<P>

119   	It has been admitted that a ten per cent elasticity is
involved in this process and it is also clear that this street in
which the
properties 117 and 117A are situated is a very popular street, which seems to
have increased in value quite markedly in
recent times.  I am of the view in
the circumstances that there has to be some elasticity applied to the valuation
of these properties.
It seems to me that there are aspects to each of the
properties which are attractive and it would really depend upon what the buyer
wanted, as each of the experts said.
<P>

120   	One problem that was identified in 117 was some alleged
defects which have been the subject of evidence by Mr Alan Brown
who has
reached the conclusion in his evidence that the amount required to rectify the
defects would be some $17,070. Mr Gleeson,
the defendant's expert building
consultant, was not required for cross-examination. He produced a report which
suggested that a figure
required for rectification work was some $5,350. Ms
Heath makes a valid point that there are some aspects to Mr Gleeson's report
that suggest that he has not attended to the matters with as great a detail as
Mr Brown.
<P>

121   	It seems that there is a problem with the underfloor of
the property being damp particularly when it rains and that needs
rectification
by way of ventilation and perhaps the installation of a pump. 
<P>

122   	It seems to me that Mr Brown's approach in valuing this
work is a little high because of the way he has approached it. He
prepared his
report in support of the plaintiff's complaint to the relevant body about the
building aspects of the house.  I am of
the view it is appropriate to
accommodate a reduction on the $17,000. It seems to me, however, that Mr
Gleeson's value of $5,000
is a little too low, having regard to the nature of
the problem, particularly with the subfloor area and the other matters to which
the plaintiff would have to attend if she were the beneficial owner of the
property. That figure then leaves me with an assessment
of somewhere between
$5,000 and $17,000.
<P>

123   	Mr McDonald's financial contributions to 117 Holt Road is
about $100,000 less than the plaintiff's. I do not intend to go
into the detail
of the contributions made. Ms Heath has very helpfully outlined that in her
submissions and it seems to me that it
is reasonable to make a general
assumption and conclusion that the plaintiff invested $100,000 more than the
defendant. However,
the defendant's contribution by way of non-financial
activity and contribution is far greater than the plaintiff's.
<P>

124   	The aspects of the defendant's contribution have been
quantified by a quantity surveyor. That quantity surveyor gave evidence
and he
was cross-examined about his report. That was Mr Stephen Batger who concluded
relevantly that the figure that he would apply
in the circumstances to the work
done by Mr McDonald in constructing the two properties at 117 Holt was about
$75,000. He broke that
figure down between labour costs and hours at 117 and
labour costs and hours at 117A. At 117 his figure was $44,380 and at 117A,
$31,040. It had been broken up as to 1266 hours at 117 and 860 hours at
117A.
<P>

125   	His methodology was that he actually constructed these
premises on the basis of what he regarded as reasonable and then applied
what
could be described as a test check of looking at Mr McDonald's work statement
and diary. Mr McDonald's work statement and diary
are not in evidence before
me, although they have been referred to in the cross-examination. It is
apparent that the defendant spent
many hours.  Mr McDonald suggests that the
hours that have been assessed by Mr Batger may be somewhat low and the figure
used to
assess his hourly rate may also be a little low.  Mr McDonald had
adopted the hourly rate last year when he obtained his judgment
in June to have
the $200,000 paid out of the joint account but I am not satisfied that the
adoption of that figure is controversial.
I think that was a reasonable
approach in the circumstances.
<P>

Mr Batger said:
<P>

"It is our considered opinion from our inspection of both properties that the
workmanship and materials are of a standard consistent
with the construction of
a high quality dwelling. It is also our considered opinion that thought was
given as to the most cost effective
method of construction."
<P>

126   	So it is that it is not merely the assessment of the
labour costs and hours spent by Mr McDonald, there is an additional
non-financial contribution here that needs to be assessed. Certainly the
financial contribution was such that it negatived the need
to have a project
manager to have someone running the jobs because Mr McDonald was there every
day. Additionally it was his assessment
of how best to save his and the
plaintiff's money in the way he approached the job. So, both in the facets of
financial and non-financial
contributions I regard Mr McDonald's contribution
as at least equivalent to a figure of $60,000.  That figure is reached on an
assessment
of the evidence of the quantity surveyor having regard to some of
the features to which Ms Heath took him and her cogent submissions
in respect
of an approach that might be adopted in respect of it if the Court saw it as a
joint venture.
<P>

127   	I am satisfied that that figure is only a notional figure
which is not really telling in respect of what the parties full
contributions
were to the site. The plaintiff attended the site and she says that she cleaned
it and cooked for the workmen and helped
with the landscaping and the garden.
That, as with most other things in this case, is in issue.
<P>

128   	The amount of time the defendant claims he spent on the
premises is also in issue. The plaintiff suggests that the defendant
has
inflated the time he spent at the premises. I am very impressed with what the
plaintiff and the defendant did for each other
in their relationship. I am
extremely impressed by the defendant in the approach that he took to the
project. I have taken the view
that it is appropriate in all the circumstances,
that it is just and equitable to adjust the parties' interest in this property
in
a way as follows.
<P>

<b>Adjustment of Interests</b>
<P>

129   	The circumstances of the finding that I make include an
assessment of the fact that the plaintiff has lived in the premises
at 117 Holt
Road for the last three years.  The defendant suggests an occupancy fee should
be taken into account in a notional sense.
The plaintiff suggests that the way
in which the defendant approaches this matter is not appropriate and has
referred me to<b> Bivano v Natoli (1998) DFC 95-207</b>. I do not intend to
descend into an assessment of mesne profits and rent in this case. It is clear
that the benefit to the plaintiff
is a factor which I am going to take into
account in assessing and adjusting the parties entitlements in this case. The
valuation
of the property at 155 Holt and 117 Holt it seems to me should be
equally at $600,000. It is too difficult in the circumstances of
the evidence
to make an accurate assessment without that elasticity. It is not a
mathematical equation approach.  It is what is just
and equitable in taking
into account the amount of money as referred to that the plaintiff has
contributed, the amount of money that
the defendant has contributed, what seem
to me to be equal contributions as homemaker in the period that they were in a
de facto
relationship. It seems to me that a just and equitable result is that
the plaintiff is entitled to the beneficial interest in the
home at 117 Holt
Road Taren Point.
<P>

130   	The accountants, Mr Benbow and Mr Grahame, adopted
different approaches, one on a commercial joint venture basis and one
on a
domestic de facto relationship basis. 
<P>

131   	The approach adopted by Mr Grahame is that if the Court
were to find that Ms Stelzer retains 117 Holt Road, which I have
decided should
occur, and Mr McDonald retains $200,000 cash withdrawn, that Mr McDonald should
pay to Ms Stelzer a figure of $13,131,
this is on the basis of a notional
return of the 200,000 and the balance of cash in the joint account being
$243,000.
<P>

132   	Mr Benbow's approach is that the 117 Holt Road should be
divided equally and that Ms Stelzer should receive $202,000 from
the joint
account and Mr McDonald $41,401 from the joint account. I am of the view that
something between those two approaches is
appropriate. In weighing up what is
just and equitable it has been difficult to assess what extra should happen, if
anything, to
adjust the plaintiff's interest, having decided that the plaintiff
is entitled to the property at 117 Holt Road. She, of course,
applies for
$100,000 out of the remaining $243,000. I think that is too much in the
circumstances. I regard the contributions and
the approach to the project and
the shortness of this relationship as a de facto relationship as something I
should take into account
in reaching the conclusions that I have.
<P>

133   	Assuming that the value of the property is $600,000, it
seems to me that the plaintiff, although contributing equally to
the homemaker
aspect of 155 Holt Road and not in any meaningful way to the financial side of
155 Holt Road, should have no more than
a figure of $25,000 payable out of the
joint account.  
<P>

134   	It seems to me that such a figure in addition to an asset
worth $635,000 (on the defendant's valuation) would be extremely
generous.
Indeed it may be thought that such a figure in addition to an asset worth
$575,000 (on the plaintiff's valuation) is an
appropriate adjustment.  However
I have placed a value of $600,000 on the property and I regard it in all the
circumstances of this
case as just and equitable that the plaintiff should have
an additional $25,000. 
<P>

135   	Accordingly I will make the orders that the plaintiff is
entitled to the beneficial interest in the property at 117 Holt
Road Taren
Point.
<P>

136   	I will make an order in the defendant's case that he is
entitled to the balance of the joint account including the money
already paid
to him, less the $25,000 which is to be paid to the plaintiff.
<P>

137   	The matter is adjourned to enable the parties to bring in
short minutes and for any argument as to an appropriate costs order.
