<b>1347/98 - ALAN CADWALLADER -v- BAJCO PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore - revised 7 May 1999)</b>
<P>

1	These reasons for judgment deal with an application by the first and second
defendants in the proceedings by amended notice of
motion filed on 27 April
1999.  In that amended application the first and second defendants, as
applicants, seek orders that under
Part 72 of the Supreme Court Rules to the
effect that a referee be appointed to consider and report on the following
matter:
<P>

	"The following question arising in the proceedings, namely, whether the second
defendants were validly appointed administrators
of the first defendant on or
about 28 November 1997 pursuant to section 436A of the Corporations Law".
<P>

2	The application is opposed by the plaintiff in the proceedings.  The third
defendant in the proceedings generally supports the
application and draws
attention to the fact that, if the application is successful and the matter is
determined by the referee in
a certain way, the third defendant will have no
interest in participating in the proceedings thereafter.
<P>

3	While the application initially sought only a reference under Part 72, in its
amended form the application seeks in the alternative
an order pursuant to Part
31 rule 2 that the same question as set out above be determined separately and
before the other questions
in the proceedings.  There is also an application
for an order for discovery on that separate question.
<P>

4	The proceedings in which this motion has been brought are proceedings by
statement of claim filed by the plaintiff on 20 April
1998.  In the statement
of claim the plaintiff alleges that a resolution by the directors of the first
defendant for the appointment
of an administrator under section 436A of the
Corporations Law was, in the circumstances, invalid and that the deed of
appointment
was also invalid.  So far as the execution of the deed of
appointment is concerned, there is a specific contention as to the validity
of
that execution on behalf of the company, the first defendant.  That is a matter
within a confined and specific compass, the determination
of which ought not to
involve substantial exploration of facts.
<P>

5	The principal challenge to the directors' resolution for the appointment of
an administrator is contained in paragraph 21 of the
statement of claim.  In
that paragraph the plaintiff alleges that the passing of the resolution and
also the execution of the deed
of appointment was carried out by the third
defendants as directors of the first defendant with the intention of stopping
the third
defendants from being replaced as directors of the first defendant at
an extraordinary general meeting which had been convened for
a date shortly
after the resolution to appoint an administrator was adopted.
<P>

6	Particulars supporting the allegation in paragraph 21 are lengthy, but
clearly they raise substantial and detailed issues of fact
as to the good faith
of the third defendants as directors of the first defendant at that time and as
to the purposes for which the
resolution to appoint an administrator was
adopted.  It is obvious that, if the allegations in paragraph 21 and the
particulars to
that paragraph are contested, the determination of matters of
fact will be a substantial undertaking involving, one presumes, affidavit
evidence, documents and substantial cross-examination.
<P>

7	The statement of claim contains several other factual allegations, some of
which might arguably be regarded as separate and distinct
from the allegations
concerning the appointment of the administrator.  One allegation is that a
subsequent meeting of creditors of
the first defendant was convened with
inadequate notice.  Another allegation is that the notice of the meeting of
creditors failed
to comply with the requirements of section 439A of the
Corporations Law with respect to various matters.  Another allegation is that
the notice of meeting failed to express conclusions as to a number of matters,
including the solvency of the company.  The statement
of claim contains prayers
for relief which, in the circumstances, seek a variety of orders which are
intended to invalidate the whole
of the administration proceedings and to
establish that the company ought to be dealt with on the basis that it is
insolvent and
that various orders should be made against the second and third
defendants.
<P>

8	This very brief account of the plaintiff's claims is sufficient to show that
there are allegations of a complex factual kind and
an important issue for
determination as to the good faith of the third defendants and their purposes
in embarking upon the course
of action which included, but was not confined to,
the appointment of an administrator of the first defendant.
<P>

9	In these circumstances, the question is whether it is appropriate for the
Court to make orders which have the effect of separating
out the issues
relating to the appointment of the administrator from other issues which the
plaintiff's statement of claim purports
to raise.
<P>

10	The applicant puts the matter first under Part 72 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  Part 72 was introduced in its present form in
1985 following the repeal
of the Arbitration Act.  It gives the Court a general discretion, except in
matters to be tried by a jury,
to appoint referees and refer to them either the
whole of the proceedings or any question to which the proceedings give rise.
The
discretion is obviously a wide one.  However, it is a discretion which must
be exercised having regard to the nature of the matter
sought to be referred
and the appropriateness of a referee dealing with the matter rather than the
matter being dealt with by the
Court itself.
<P>

11	In my opinion, the question of appointment of the administrator in this case
is quintessentially a matter which ought to be determined
by this Court rather
than to be sent out to a referee.  Directors are fiduciaries.  The Court has a
responsibility in proceedings
brought before it to ensure that those
fiduciaries discharge the duty of good faith which the law imposes upon them.
A fundamental
part of the duty of good faith is the requirement that
fiduciaries exercise their powers, including powers conferred upon them by
statute, in good faith and for proper purposes.  The Court must be jealous to
ensure those requirements are adhered to in any case.
<P>

12	Given the nature of the allegations and also the factual issues to which
those allegations give rise, in my opinion it would
be inappropriate to
exercise my discretion under Part 72 to appoint a referee and require a report
on that matter.
<P>

13	As to the alternative claim under Part 31 rule 2, again, it seems to me that
this is not an appropriate case for the identification
and determination of a
separate question.  I accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiff as
respondent that not much utility
would be derived from determination of the
separate question from the point of view of the time of hearing.  The other
issues in
the case, while substantially separate in terms of their factual
component, are unlikely to involve anywhere near as much time as
the
determination of the question of good faith and proper purposes with respect to
the appointment.  Counsel for the plaintiff has
estimated that, from the point
of view of time, the determination of the separate issue would take eighty or
ninety per cent of the
total hearing time and I have no reason to doubt that
estimate.  Overall, there is no compelling reason, from the point of view of
practicability, for the Court to seek to have a separate question of this kind
determined.
<P>

14	Additionally, counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that, in determining
the issues of bona fides and proper purposes of the
directors in their
resolution to appoint an administrator, it is appropriate for the Court to have
regard to facts which occurred
prior to and subsequent to the adoption of the
resolution in question.  This factual investigation sheds light on the purposes
which
the directors may have had in mind at the time when they made their
decision.  Determination of a factual sequence of events which
includes, but is
not limited to, the events at the very time of the directors' decision has been
thought to be appropriate in many
cases in which the bona fides of directors'
decisions have been challenged.  I need only refer to the judgment at first
instance
by Street CJ in <i>Ampol Petroleum Limited v R W Miller (Holdings)
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%20850" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 NSWLR 850</a>;  affd <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1974/1974_3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] UKPC 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20821" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 821.</a>  Nothing said by the Privy
Council in that case suggested that his Honour's approach to the determination
of facts was in any way
in error.  
<P>

15	Counsel for the plaintiff therefore submits that to cut off a piece of the
case and determine it as a separate question creates
the risk that the Court
may not have an adequate and complete picture of the facts and circumstances
leading to and following from
the directors' determination, which may cast
light on their purposes.  In those circumstances, says counsel, it would be
risky and
not merely impractical of the Court to order that a separate question
be determined.  I accept this submission.  
<P>

16	I note that the Court must proceed cautiously if a party seeks orders under
Part 31 for determination of complex questions of
fact (see esp. <i>Wardley
Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a>, 533).   I am
not persuaded it would be a safe course of action in this case to use Part 31
in the manner advocated.  I therefore
propose to deny the application in the
amended notice of motion.
<P>

17	I propose to order that the costs be costs of the proceedings.  I think
there was an arguable case for determination of a separate
question, though I
have reached the opposite conclusion.  I think if the matter had fallen out
differently, there might have been
some way we could have progressed the case
in an expeditious manner.
<P>

18	In the circumstances, therefore, my orders will be:
<P>

	1. application in the amended notice of motion denied in whole.
<P>

	2. costs of the amended notice of motion be costs of the proceedings.
<P>

19	I shall ask the parties to confer with respect to the further conduct of the
proceedings, and if possible to bring in short minutes
of orders to be made by
consent.  I shall stand the matter down in the list.
<P>

20	[Later in the same day] The parties have, by consent, handed up short
minutes of order which I initial and date for the purposes
of identification.
I note that:
<P>

	(a) Orders 1 and 2 in that document confirm the orders which I made this
morning on the second and third defendants' contested
notice of motion and
therefore confirm orders which this morning were not made by consent.
<P>

	(b) Orders 3-6 inclusive are proposed by the consent of all parties to the
present proceedings.
<P>

	(c) As regards order 6, I have been informed by the solicitors for the third
defendants that the only other non-corporate person
in the proceedings referred
to in paragraph 6, namely, Bruce Cadwallader, consents to an order in terms of
paragraph 6.
<P>

I make the orders in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 and the directions in
paragraph 3 of that document.
