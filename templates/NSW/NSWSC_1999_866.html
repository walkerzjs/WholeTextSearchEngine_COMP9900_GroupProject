MONDAY 23 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<b>2987/99 - W D &amp; H O WILLS HOLDINGS LTD (APPLICATION OF)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This matter comes before me today after two meetings
of shareholders of the plaintiff have been held at which the
scheme of
arrangement, which I am asked to approve, was agreed to by shareholders by
majorities of 99.94 percent and 100 percent
respectively.
<P>

2  	The scheme has the effect of causing the shareholders of the
plaintiff, other than BAT Australia Pty Ltd, to transfer their
shares into
Rothmans Holdings Ltd for cash consideration.  There is a selective share
buy-back of the shareholding of BAT Australia
Pty Ltd and then Rothmans
Holdings issues shares in that company to BAT Australia.
<P>

3  	The conditions precedent stated in the scheme relate to various
approvals by regulators including the Foreign Investments Review
Board and the
New Zealand Commerce Commission, as well as shareholder approvals in respect of
the buy-back by Wills' minority shareholders
and also an approval by Rothmans
shareholders.  One of the conditions relates to certain transactions (`the
Imperial transactions')
by which assets of the plaintiff are the subject of a
structure of mutual offers of sale and purchase by the plaintiff and Imperial
Tobacco Group plc, which will lead to sale of the assets to Imperial Tobacco
Group if the offers are accepted.  There are similar
conditions in the merger
implementation agreement.
<P>

4  	In order to identify specific matters which the plaintiff will be
able to prove so as to establish the satisfaction of the conditions,
the scheme
is drafted so that certificates are to be issued.  One certificate is a
certificate of Wills, Rothmans and Imperial Tobacco
which confirms that the
condition relating to the Imperial transactions has been satisfied or waived by
the parties to the transactions.
 The other certificate is by Rothmans and
Wills to the effect that the conditions precedent in the merger implementation
agreement
have been satisfied or waived and the conditions precedent to the
scheme have been satisfied.
<P>

5  	The evidence before me today includes an affidavit by Nicholas
Frank Hugo Greiner of 23 August 1999 which annexes a copy of
a certificate
signed on behalf of the plaintiff and Rothmans Holdings Ltd, certifying that
upon the making of an order by this Court
at a hearing scheduled to take place
on 20 August 1999, each of the conditions precedent to the merger
implementation agreement and
the scheme of arrangement will have been
satisfied.  There is no evidence as to the date upon which that certificate was
signed,
but if it was signed before 20 August 1999 it could not have been
comprehensively correct, because one of the scheme conditions (namely,
the
condition requiring a certificate with respect to the Imperial transactions)
had not, at that stage, been met.
<P>

6  	The certificate by the plaintiff, Rothmans Holdings and  Imperial
Tobacco Group with respect to the Imperial transactions is
in evidence.  Two of
the signatures bear the date 22 August 1999.
<P>

7  	The matter came before me on 20 August 1999 and on that day I was
informed that the Imperial transactions certificate was not
yet ready.  The
case was called and there was no appearance other than for the plaintiff.  I
then adjourned the matter until today.
 
<P>

8  	As at today the position is that the certificate with respect to
the Imperial transactions has been provided and the certificate
with respect to
satisfaction of the other conditions of the scheme covers satisfaction of those
conditions in every other respect.
 I am, therefore, satisfied that the scheme
conditions have been met and there is no obstacle to my making the orders which
are now
sought.
<P>

9  	Counsel for the plaintiff drew my attention to the fact that when
notice of the meetings of shareholders was first published
in the Sydney
Morning Herald on 2 August 1999, the notice as published omitted the name of
the plaintiff company.  The notice was
otherwise in proper form and was
published again, this time with the name of the company clearly shown, on 5
August 1999.
<P>

10  	I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, the requirements of
the Corporations Law and of my orders made on 16 July 1999 have
been complied
with and that it is not necessary in the circumstances for the Court to make
any further curative order because of
the publishing error.
<P>

11  	Finally, I should note that the drafting of the scheme to
nominate specific events - namely, the issue of certificates of compliance
to
simplify the task of proving the satisfaction of conditions precedent which
relate to complex events - seems to me to have been
a useful technique to have
adopted in the circumstances of this case.  Nevertheless, where there are
important regulatory issues
at stake, it appears to me desirable that the Court
be provided with additional evidence to show that the regulatory approval to
which the condition relates has in fact been given, and not merely that there
is a certificate to that effect.
<P>

12  	In the present case the transaction raises important competition
issues which have been examined by the Australian Competition
and Consumer
Commission, especially with respect to the Imperial transactions.  The
plaintiff tendered evidence to show that undertakings
had been given to the
satisfaction of the Commission.  It seems to me appropriate that such evidence
should have been adduced, in
addition to evidence that a certificate had been
issued by the parties to the Imperial transactions.
<P>

13  	The plaintiff has handed up short minutes of orders which I
initial and date for the purposes of identification.  I make orders
1, 2 and 3
in that document.  I direct that Exhibit DR 1 of the affidavit of Mr Reichel of
23 August 1999 be returned to the plaintiff.
