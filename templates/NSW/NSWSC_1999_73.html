<P>

	<b>JUDGMENT  </b>(Plaintiff's subpoena to Department of Community Services)
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  I do not propose at this stage to set aside the subpoena, though
paragraphs such as 2 always cause problems.
<P>

2	It would seem to me the following two things are apparent:  first, from what
I know now of the issues in this litigation, the
persons referred to in the
schedule are persons whose role in this case, at its litigation, will be of
some very great importance.
<P>

3	Secondly, material from the Department, subject to what I will later say,
again based on my understanding of the issues, could
be of a kind that properly
and legitimately be deployed forensically in the litigation of the issues of
this case.
<P>

4	Certainly the court, and I have no doubt the plaintiff, is sensible of what I
will describe broadly as matters of policy affecting
the operation of the
Department of Community Services in the areas of privacy, confidentiality, and
the protection of the interests
of those persons who fall within its
jurisdiction.
<P>

5	I am of the view that the plaintiff can, with facility, particularise the
classes of documents he requires produced. For example,
if one category of
document required is a record of the dates and places of the
institutionalisation of the several persons referred
to in the schedule, then
that can be articulated.
<P>

6	If another class of document or thing is comprised of medical and
psychological reports concerning the various people, that can
be articulated.
If a class of document is made up of reports of officers of the Department in a
category other than psychiatric,
medical or psychological in relation to the
named individuals, that can be articulated.
<P>

7	I cannot, of course, exhaustively catalogue the classes, but I am of the view
that they are capable of being described in relation
to each of the persons
referred to.
<P>

8	It may be that there is a category of material that in a historical way would
disclose, for example, when the person, as it were,
first came under the
jurisdiction of the Department, or when the person first came under the
jurisdiction of the Department within
the timeframe set out in the subpoena,
and the last time the person came within the jurisdiction of the Department
within that timeframe.
 There might be a category of material that discloses
what I would  describe as a calendar of contact between the person and the
Department.
<P>

9	In other words, I am not presently persuaded formally to set aside the
subpoena.  I am persuaded, given the cooperative approach
indicated by the
Department through its counsel, that the plaintiff should further categorise
the material along the lines of, but
not restricted to, the classes of
documents and things to which I have referred.
<P>

10	It would seem to me that the essence of the characterisation would be the
subject matter of the kind to which I have already
referred;
institutionalisation, medical and other reports, departmental officer reports,
coming into and going out of the jurisdiction
of the Department within the
relevant timeframe, and so on.
<P>

11	There will be a saving in costs both to the Department, and to the
plaintiff, if this can be done by communication from the plaintiff's
solicitors
to those instructing Mr Bartley.  
<P>

12	The time within which it will be done can be the subject of discussion.  The
Department will have of course liberty to apply
to restore the matter of the
subpoena at any time.
<P>
