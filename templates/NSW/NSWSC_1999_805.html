<P>

<b>3643/97	EDISON HORTIS &amp; ANOR   -v-   GEORGE PAPANIKOLAOU &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>There is presently before the Court an
application by the plaintiffs Edison Hortis and Dionysia Hortis made by way of
notice of motion
filed on 21 July 1999.  By that notice of motion the
plaintiffs seek orders for the dismissal of certain parts of the amended
cross-claim
filed by the defendants George Papanikolaou and Maria Papanikolaou
on 11 March 1998 and, in the alternative, an order that certain
parts of that
amended cross-claim be struck out.
<P>

2   	The plaintiffs are named as cross-defendants to that
amended cross-claim in which the defendants are the cross-claimants.
<P>

3   	The proceedings were instituted by statement of claim filed
on 18 August 1997.  Subsequently there was on 22 September 1997
filed an
amended statement of claim.  The cause of action relied upon by the plaintiffs
in the amended statement of claim related
to the rights of the plaintiffs as
the owners of certain property at Bankstown against the defendants as
guarantors of a lease entered
into in respect of that property by a company
Kalwino Pty Ltd (to which I shall refer as "Kalwino") as lessee, on 13 March
1996 with
the plaintiffs as lessors. The defendants guaranteed the performance
by Kalwino of its obligations under that lease.  
<P>

4   	There was filed a defence to the amended statement of claim
on 16 October 1997 and there was also filed a cross-claim, and
subsequently on
11 March 1998 an amended cross-claim.  It is that amended cross-claim which is
the subject of the present application.
<P>

5   	By that amended cross-claim the defendants in paragraph 2,
which is headed 'Refusal of Assignment' assert that they were sole
shareholders
and directors of Kalwino (that company being described as 'now in liquidation')
and assert that the company entered
into a contract for the sale of a business
conducted by Kalwino as a reception centre operator, such sale being subject to
the assignment
of the lease (being described as `subject to the assignment of
the lease between the plaintiff and the company as lessee and the
defendants as
guarantors').
<P>

6   	Paragraphs 3 and 4 assert that the consent of the plaintiff
as lessor was sought to the assignment of the lease, such consent
being
conditional on the sale of the business, and that the plaintiff wrongfully
refused to consent to the assignment.  
<P>

7   	Paragraph 5 asserts that the defendants as a result of such
refusal suffered damage (such damage being described as being 'consequent
upon
the failure of the company to receive the proceeds of the sale of the business
nett $468,649.50').
<P>

8   	Particulars of damage are then set forth in paragraph 6.  I
note that the amended cross-claim contains two paragraphs numbered
6.
Paragraph number 6, where secondly appearing, is in the following form:
<P>

In the alternative the plaintiff filed to mitigate their loss by their refusal
to consent to the assignment of the business.
<P>

9   	Paragraph 7 sets forth particulars of mitigation of loss.
Paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the amended cross-claim relate
to an
alleged refusal by the plaintiffs to discharge a mortgage.  Those paragraphs
are not the subject of any application presently
brought by the plaintiffs in
respect to the amended statement of claim.
<P>

10   	Paragraph 1 in the notice of motion seeks dismissal of the
claim of the defendants in respect to any cause of action arising
out of the
refusal of the plaintiffs to consent to the assignment of the lease.  
<P>

11   	Paragraph 2 of the notice of motion seeks dismissal of the
cause of action asserted by the defendants as arising out of the
failure of the
plaintiffs to mitigate their loss.  Each of those paragraphs of the notice of
motion seeks dismissal of the cause
of action pursuant to the provisions of
Part 13 rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, it being submitted that the parts of
the amended
cross-claim the subject of the present applications disclose no
cause of action and are frivolous and vexatious and are an abuse
of the process
of the Court.
<P>

12   	Part 13 rule 5 provides, relevantly, in subrule (1)
thereof as follows:
<P>

Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief
in the proceedings

<P>

(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; 
<P>

(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or 
<P>

(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court, 
<P>

the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or in
relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.
<P>

13   	The principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion
of the Court under the foregoing provisions of the Rules are well
known and do
not here need to be repeated.  They are set forth in a number of authorities
including the decision of the High Court
of Australia in <i>General Steel
Industries Incorporated v Commissioner for Railways </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a>, in
particular the judgment of Barwick CJ.
<P>

14   	It is not necessary for the Court on an application such
as this to be persuaded that at an ultimate hearing one or other
party is
likely to succeed.  What is necessary in order for the applicants to obtain the
relief sought in their notice of motion
is for the applicants to satisfy the
Court that at a final hearing there is no possibility that the defendants will
succeed upon
those parts of the amended cross-claim which are the subject of
the present application.  
<P>

15   	It is appropriate that I should deal firstly with the
complaint made by the plaintiffs concerning paragraphs 6, where secondly
appearing, and 7 in the amended cross-claim which assert a cause of action
grounded upon the alleged failure of the plaintiffs to
mitigate their loss by
their refusal to consent to what is described in paragraph 6 as the assignment
of the business, but presumably
is intended to mean the assignment of the
lease.
<P>

16   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that a
failure to mitigate loss may constitute a defence but that it does
not
constitute any cause of action known to the law.  I am in agreement with that
submission.  No authorities to the contrary were
relied upon by the defendants
in supporting the asserted cause of action pleaded in paragraph 6 and 7 of the
amended cross-claim.
 I propose therefore, since those paragraphs do not
disclose any cause of action, to dismiss the claim of the defendants based upon
such asserted cause of action.
<P>

17   	I turn now to the complaint of the plaintiffs concerning
the asserted cause of action pleaded in paragraphs 2 to 6, where
firstly
appearing, in the amended cross-claim, being a cause of action grounded upon
the alleged refusal of the plaintiffs to consent
to an assignment of the lease.
It will be appreciated that the Court in considering such an application
assumes that any factual
matters asserted in that pleading can at an ultimate
hearing be established by the party asserting those factual matters.  
<P>

18   	The amended cross-claim recognises that the lease was a
lease between not the defendants but Kalwino, a company of which the
defendants
were the sole shareholders and directors.   There is no assertion in the
pleading that the defendants themselves have
any contractual right with the
plaintiffs.  Kalwino is in liquidation.
<P>

19   	It is also to be observed that concerning a dispute
between the present plaintiffs and Kalwino that company in 1996 instituted
proceedings 3816 of 1996 in the Equity Division.  The relief sought in those
proceedings, which were instituted by summons, was not
identical to the relief
sought in the present proceedings.  Indeed, it was relief relating to the
rights of Kalwino under the lease
and the alleged interference by the present
plaintiffs with those rights and, in particular, the right of quiet enjoyment
of the
premises.
<P>

20   	The matter came before Mr Justice Cohen upon an
interlocutory application.  His Honour delivered a judgment on 7 February
1997.
It would appear that there had already at that stage been an application made
by Kalwino to the plaintiffs for their consent
to assignment of the lease,
which consent had not been forthcoming.  However, that assignment, which was
adverted to in Mr Justice
Cohen's judgment, was not the assignment which is the
subject of the claim made by the defendants in the amended cross-claim.
<P>

21   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that,
although they were not parties to the lease and although it was Kalwino
which
had the entitlement under the lease to seek an assignment thereof, nevertheless
as shareholders in Kalwino, firstly, they have
suffered a loss in consequence
of the withholding by the plaintiffs of their consent to an assignment of the
lease and, secondly,
that they are entitled to bring the present proceedings.

<P>

22   	It has rightly been pointed out by Counsel for the
applicant/plaintiffs that it is not every loss suffered by a person which
gives
rise to some legal right of redress in that person.  A loss of itself does not
establish a cause of action. Neither is it the
law that the rights of sole
shareholders can be regarded as identical to the rights of the company in which
they are the sole shareholders.
<P>

23   	In the instant case Kalwino is in liquidation.  If there
are rights which may have arisen as a result of the failure of the
plaintiffs
to consent to an assignment of the lease between the plaintiffs and Kalwino
then it is for the company through its liquidator
to pursue these rights, not
for the defendants.
<P>

24   	I am satisfied that there is no cause of action in the
defendants, either in their capacity as sole shareholders and directors
or any
other capacity, to bring a claim against the plaintiffs arising out of an
alleged loss suffered by reason of the plaintiffs
failing to consent to the
assignment of the lease between the plaintiffs and Kalwino.  There is no
suggestion in the instant case
that the defendants had any contractual
relationship with the plaintiffs which might have given rise to some cause of
action in the
defendants.
<P>

25   	In those circumstances therefore I propose to order that
the proceedings grounded upon the refusal of the plaintiffs to consent
to the
assignment of the lease be dismissed.
<P>

26   	It follows therefore that I will make the orders sought in
paragraphs 1 and 2 in the notice of motion filed by the plaintiffs
on 21 July
1999.  It is unnecessary for me to deal with the claim for alternative relief
sought in paragraph 3.
<P>

27   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I make orders as in paragraphs 1 and 2 in the notice of motion filed by the
plaintiffs on 21 July 1999;
<P>

2.	I order that the defendants pay the costs of the plaintiffs of the aforesaid
notice of motion;
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the plaintiffs to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs;
<P>

4.	I grant to the defendants leave to file an amended defence raising a
defence, asserting failure of the plaintiffs to mitigate
their loss on or
before 19 August 1999;
<P>

5.	I make orders as in short minutes of order dated 5 August 1999 signed by
Counsel for the plaintiffs and the solicitor for the
defendants, initialled by
me and filed in Court this day.
