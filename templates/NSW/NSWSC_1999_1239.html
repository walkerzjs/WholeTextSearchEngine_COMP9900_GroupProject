<b>020841/97 - Vicki Jane Sprowles v Makita (Australia) Pty Limited</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is an action for damages for personal injuries
brought by the plaintiff Vicki Jane Sprowles against the defendant,
her former
employer Makita (Australia) Pty Limited ("Makita") arising out of an accident
which the plaintiff alleges occurred on
30 June 1986.  The plaintiff claims
that on 30 June 1986 she slipped and fell down some stairs on a stairway
leading from a roof
top car park to her employer's office in a building at
Gladesville.  The proceedings were commenced in the District Court, after
an
extension of time had been granted in which to commence the proceedings, and
they were then transferred to the Supreme Court.
 As the alleged accident
happened as long ago as 30 June 1986, the assessment of damages, if the
plaintiff succeeds in establishing
liability, is unaffected by the provisions
of Div 3 of Pt 5 of the <i>Workers Compensation Act</i>.  Makita has disputed
liability, disputed that the plaintiff has really suffered all of the symptoms
and disabilities she has claimed
and disputed that any symptoms and
disabilities she has really suffered were caused by any accident on 30 June
1986.
<P>

2  	The evidence at the trial consisted of oral evidence given in the
plaintiff's case by the plaintiff herself, her mother, three
women friends of
the plaintiff, a scientific expert Associate Professor D H Morton and a
psychiatrist Dr Andrew Wilson;  oral evidence
given in the defendant's case by
Mr Geoffrey Firth, a former employee of the defendant, and by Dr David Millons,
an orthopaedic surgeon;
 and various documents tendered by either the plaintiff
or the defendant.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

3  	The plaintiff was born on 14 October 1955.  She was accordingly
thirty years old at the time of the alleged accident and is
now forty-four
years old.  
<P>

4  	She left school after obtaining her school certificate.  After
leaving school she did a course to become a computer operator.
 She then worked
as a computer operator for a number of employers, including AEWL (the
Association of Employers of Waterside Labour)
for which she worked for eight
and a half years.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff has never married.  However, between October 1980
and October 1990 she was, subject to at least one interruption,
in a de facto
relationship with a man named Dormer.  Evidence was later given that in 1984
she became pregnant to another man but
had the pregnancy terminated.  
<P>

6  	In December 1985 the plaintiff was diagnosed as having
endometriosis, a condition which would make it difficult for her to become
pregnant.  
<P>

7  	The plaintiff became employed by Makita on 14 January 1984 and
remained employed by Makita until December 1992.  For the first
twelve months
she was employed by Makita she was a computer operator.  Then she was promoted
to supervisor and in about 1990 she
was promoted to the position of trainee
programmer.  
<P>

8  	Between the end of 1985 and the date of the alleged accident the
plaintiff's mother had a stroke.  In April 1986 the plaintiff's
father, with
whom she had had a close relationship, died after a long illness.  About this
time the plaintiff was prescribed anti-depressants,
which had the opposite
effect from that intended by making her feel depressed and suicidal.
<P>

9  	In June 1986 the plaintiff was living at Kenthurst.  Each day she
drove in her car from her home to Makita's premises at Gladesville,
parked her
car in the car park on the roof of the building, walked through a fire door and
then walked down concrete stairs to the
first floor of the building, where she
worked.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff said that on 30 June 1986 she was wearing flat red
shoes when she went to work and she identified a shoe shown
to her as being one
of the shoes she had been wearing on that day.  She said that she had owned the
shoes for two months, during
which she had worn them probably once a week, and
that after the accident she had worn the shoes for a short further period of
time
and had then stopped wearing them.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff said in her evidence that the stairs were made of
smooth concrete.  She also said that the stairs had "dusty
grit over them" but
in his final submissions her counsel did not seek to rely on this evidence.
<P>

12  	On the morning of 30 June 1986 the plaintiff walked down one
flight of steps on the stairway, walked across the landing and
then started
walking down a second flight of eight or nine steps.  There was a railing on
the right hand, interior, side of this
flight.  The plaintiff gave the
following further evidence:-
<P>

"I took a couple of steps.  Going from memory my foot went out from underneath
me and I tried to grab the rail to stop myself from
falling but the next thing
I was crashing down the stairs out of control.  I could not stop myself.  The
next thing I knew I was
at the bottom".
<P>

13  	On a photograph of the flight of steps the plaintiff identified
the third step from the top as being the step she had fallen
from.  
<P>

14  	The plaintiff gave further evidence:-
<P>

"When I hit the bottom landing I was thrown back and my head was jammed up
underneath the bottom handrail.."
<P>

15  	The plaintiff said that she felt pain in her lower back, her
left arm and in her head and she was in shock.  She had a cut
on her left leg,
which was bleeding. 
<P>

16  	The plaintiff told her superior Mr Firth what had happened.  She
remained at work that day.  However, she said that "by the
end of the day
everything was sore".  She drove home, experiencing difficulty in changing
gears in her car.  She did not go to a
doctor "because I just thought I was
bruised".  She woke up the next morning "very sore".  
<P>

17  	The plaintiff said that between 30 June 1986 and 10 July 1986
she felt pain in her spine, head, neck, right arm, shoulder,
collar bone and
left leg.  On 10 July 1986 while she was at work the plaintiff bent down to put
some paper into a printer and "I
found as I went...  to straighten up I
couldn't straighten up...  it hurt like billyo... at the base of the spine and
up a bit",
where she had been feeling pain since 30 June.
<P>

18  	On 10 July 1986 the plaintiff consulted an osteopath Louise
Adam.  The plaintiff claimed in her evidence that she saw Louise
Adam two or
three times a week for the first couple of weeks.  However, receipts kept by
the plaintiff indicate that for the first
few weeks she saw Louise Adam once a
week and that she saw Louise Adam a total of sixteen times between 10 July 1986
and 27 November
1986.  The plaintiff resumed seeing Louise Adam on 13 July 1987
and then saw her on many occasions up to 7 November 1989.  The treatment
given
by Louise Adam relieved the plaintiff's pain "temporarily".
<P>

19  	The plaintiff consulted another osteopath Julie Chenery once in
each of the months of August, September and November 1986.
 The plaintiff
explained that she initially saw Julie Chenery when she needed to see an
osteopath urgently and Louise Adam was unavailable.
The plaintiff consulted
Julie Chenery regularly between 4 December 1986 and 6 July 1987.  After that
she saw Julie Chenery on a few
isolated occasions.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff gave evidence about other incidents in which she
had been involved.  In about 1971 she had fallen off a horse
and torn ligaments
in her left knee but she had had no residual problems.
<P>

21  	The plaintiff had had two motor vehicle accidents in 1981 and
one in 1986.  She said that she had not been hurt in two of these
accidents.
In one of the accidents occurring in 1981 she had suffered a whiplash injury
and had had to wear a neck brace for a week.
 She had two further motor vehicle
accidents in September 1987 and February 1989, which were minor.  
<P>

22  	In her evidence in chief the plaintiff was asked about her
relationship with Mr Dormer.  When asked whether there had been
incidents of
violence, she answered "not intentional".  However, Mr Dormer had broken her
nose "by accident".  She had protested
to him about the dangerous way in which
he was driving a car in which they were travelling.  According to the
plaintiff, Mr Dormer
went to hit her on the shoulder but she spun her head to
say something to him and Mr Dormer's fist connected with her nose.  In another
incident Mr Dormer put his hands on top of the plaintiff's head and pushed
down.  The plaintiff denied that this incident had caused
her any injury.  At
first the plaintiff said that this incident had happened about two weeks before
the accident on 30 June 1986.
 Then she said it had happened about two weeks
before her birthday on 14 October 1985.
<P>

23  	In about August 1988 the plaintiff first consulted a
chiropractor, Mr Goodrich.  She said that when she first saw Mr Goodrich
she
had two types of "coloured vision", headaches, a tendency to drop glasses or
cups, pain in her face, locking of her jaw, a feeling
that her throat was
swollen and pain down the whole of her spine and in her left leg.  Of these
symptoms the only one which has so
far improved is the locking up of her jaw.
When the plaintiff saw Mr Goodrich she was asked to give a full history, so she
told Mr
Goodrich about the incidents in which she had fallen off a horse, which
had required her to wear a neck brace and in which her boy
friend had pushed
down on her head.  The plaintiff saw Mr Goodrich on many occasions between
August 1988 and June 1992.  
<P>

24  	The plaintiff saw a physiotherapist Louise Weavers on half a
dozen occasions in December 1988. She saw another physiotherapist
L Werners on
many occasions between January 1989 and June 1989.  Between July 1989 and July
1990 she saw another physiotherapist
Colette Roberts many times.
<P>

25  	In December 1989 the plaintiff commenced seeing another
osteopath Anne Petrie, in lieu of Louise Adam, because Anne Petrie's
premises
were closer to the plaintiff's home.  The plaintiff saw Ms Petrie on a large
number of occasions between December 1989 and
November 1997.
<P>

26  	The plaintiff said that at times she was seeing an osteopath, a
chiropractor and a physiotherapist, all in the same week. 
The treatments she
received afforded her only temporary relief, for a few hours only.
<P>

27  	At about the end of 1989 the plaintiff contracted glandular
fever.  She was incapacitated for six weeks.  After she had recovered,
the
symptoms she continued to experience were the same as she had experienced
before she contracted glandular fever.
<P>

28  	In 1990 the plaintiff became pregnant by Mr Dormer.  She had the
pregnancy terminated at about eight weeks through the Pre-Term
Foundation.
When asked in her evidence in chief why she had had the pregnancy terminated
she said that she was having problems with
her breathing.  "I felt dreadful and
I didn't think that the child was getting enough oxygen.  If I wasn't getting
enough oxygen,
I didn't think the child was".  It was "a big decision" to
terminate the pregnancy and not one she wanted to take.
<P>

29  	In late 1991 the plaintiff formally reported the accident on 30
June 1986 for the first time.  She said in her evidence "I
was getting tired of
paying all the bills and once I found it wasn't too late to put a claim in, I
thought I can at least put a claim
in and ask them about the bills".  On 29
November 1991 the plaintiff wrote a letter to the financial controller of
Makita in the
following terms:-
<P>

"On June 30, 1986, as I was walking down the stairs from the carpark at our
previous offices at Gladesville, I fell down from the
last landing.  I was
limping badly and had cut my leg which was bleeding.  I advised my boss, Geoff
Firth immediately, although at
the time I presumed the pains I felt would
dissipate.  However, the pains got worse and other symptoms, such as daily
migraines and
coloured vision, feeling sick, loss of strength in my arms and
legs appeared, until finally one day at work, as I bent over to move
a box of
paper, I found it so painful to resume standing that I decided to seek an
osteopath to find out what was wrong.
<P>

I saw the osteopath twice a week to start, then weekly unless I was sick.
Finding that I wasn't getting much better, I sought a
chiropractor, then a
physiotherapist.  I changed osteopaths and started to get better, however, I
still have to have weekly visits
to keep reasonably free from pain, as well as
seeing the chiropractor once a month.
<P>

Eventually, I realised the costs were too great so I spoke to Makita, who
advised that I write this letter and they would forward
it on to the Insurance
Company involved.
<P>

I don't recall there being any witnesses to my fall".
<P>

30  	On 20 December 1991 a notice of injury was lodged by the
plaintiff.  In answer to a question on the form of notice of injury
"what
happened", she wrote:-
<P>

"On the way down the steps from the car park on the roof I slipped and fell to
the bottom".
<P>

31  	On the employer's report of the injury the plaintiff wrote:-
<P>

"At work coming down the stairs from the car park I slipped and fell to the
next landing".
<P>

32  	The plaintiff had continued working at Makita.  Apart from when
she was ill with glandular fever, she had not missed any time
off work.
<P>

33  	In January 1992 a man named Weekes commenced working for Makita.
He worked in close proximity to the plaintiff.  According
to the plaintiff, Mr
Weekes engaged in sexual harassment of her.  The sexual harassment included
making lewd remarks to her on a
daily basis.  The plaintiff complained to Mr
Firth but did not specify sexual harassment.  Eventually on 7 December 1992 she
complained
to Mr Firth that Mr Weekes was sexually harassing her.  On the same
day the plaintiff wrote and handed in a letter of resignation.
 The letter was
in the following terms:-
<P>

"As a result of sexual harassment in the form of being verbally abused and
called a slut several times, I have come to the conclusion
that it would be in
my best interests if I am no longer forced to work with one Michael Weeks and
therefore I hereby tender 2 weeks
notice of my intention to resign my position
at Makita Australia".
<P>

34  	In her evidence the plaintiff denied that sexual harassment was
the sole reason for her resigning.  She had written the letter
in the heat of
the moment.  The other reason for her resignation was "I was just too sick to
keep going on.  I just couldn't cope
with his harassment any further".  Pain in
various parts of her body was making it difficult for her to sleep.  She was
having difficulty
in remembering and concentrating.
<P>

35  	After the plaintiff resigned, she took proceedings under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/aa204/" class="autolink_findacts">Anti-Discrimination Act</a></i> against Makita and obtained a lump sum by way of
compensation.  She also successfully took proceedings against Makita for the
recovery
of the value of long service leave and other entitlements.  After she
resigned her symptoms became worse.  The symptoms included
pain, insomnia and
dizzy spells.
<P>

36  	Since she resigned from Makita the plaintiff has done little
work.  In 1993 she worked for a company named Promath, selling
mathematics
teaching cassettes for school children. According to her evidence, she
underwent training for two to three weeks and
then worked for five or six
weeks, although in answer to a leading question put by her counsel she agreed
that she had worked between
January and October 1993.  She was dismissed
because of absences from work.  
<P>

37  	The plaintiff then worked for a company called Tresleaf, doing
piece work at home putting plastic sheets on wires of electrical
components.
She found that doing this work caused her right arm and her back to ache.
<P>

38  	In 1996 the plaintiff did a few days work for the Australian
Bureau of Statistics, distributing and then collecting census
forms.
<P>

39  	By some time in 1993 the plaintiff had run out of money.  The
plaintiff went to the Commonwealth Employment Service and registered
for the
New Start Programme.  She "blanked out" in a CES office and it was suggested to
her that she should see a doctor.  It was
then, in about July 1993, that for
the first time she saw a doctor, a general practitioner Dr Batterham.
<P>

40  	In October 1993 the plaintiff went to live with her mother at
her mother's home and she has remained there until the present.
 Since June
1995 she has been receiving an invalid pension.
<P>

41  	The plaintiff gave evidence about what she says are her present
symptoms and disabilities.  Her complaints include the following.
 She can only
walk a very short distance, before she gets hot, is unable to get sufficient
air in, gets dizzy and blacks out.  She
always has headaches, which are worse
when she has coloured vision.  She has episodes of coloured vision, sometimes
three or four
times a week, which last between twenty minutes and an hour.  She
sleeps very little at night, sometimes two or three hours and sometimes
not at
all.  She takes imovane and valium for her insomnia.  Her memory is "dreadful".
Her ability to concentrate "waxes and wanes".
 She has difficulty in moving her
head in relation to her neck.  Her upper back is always sore.  If she uses her
right arm, the whole
arm "stops working".  She is restricted in raising her
right hand above shoulder height.  Her left leg and her hip ache.  She has
no
appetite; she has only one meal a day and if she is feeling nauseous she does
not eat at all.  She is depressed, anxious, easily
emotionally upset and not
alert.  She used to have a good sex life but last had sex in 1996.  When she
attempted to have sex, she
got out of breath, could not achieve orgasm and her
lower back became sore.  
<P>

42  	The plaintiff gave evidence that at present she was having a
hour's massage twice a week and was also seeing an osteopath once
a week.
Receipts indicate that between 29 October 1999 and 19 November 1999 she was
regularly receiving "remedial massage therapy"
from Penelope G Wardle and
osteopathic treatment from a Windsor osteopathic clinic.
<P>

43  	In the past the plaintiff has, apart from osteopaths,
chiropractors and physiotherapists, tried laser treatment, hypnotherapy,
acupuncture and radionics, none of which would appear to have helped her.
<P>

44  	After the plaintiff has been to a masseuse or an osteopath she
has a hot bath for half an hour and then lies down for half
and hour.  She
takes various medications, principally analgesics and drugs for her
insomnia.
<P>

45  	The plaintiff did not complain that she was incapable of
attending to her own personal care, although she said that she had
difficulty
in showering, because she could not tip her head back and she had to get into a
bath backside first, because her feet
are "very cold" and "can't feel" and she
gets chilblains if she puts her feet in first.
<P>

46  	The plaintiff is still living with her mother, who is now
seventy years old, who had a stroke in 1986 and who this year suffered
from
pneumonia.  Her mother does everything in the household, cooking, cleaning
(although someone is now employed to come in and
clean the house), mowing,
gardening, washing and ironing.  The plaintiff estimated that her mother spends
four hours a day looking
after the plaintiff and has been doing so since
October 1993.
<P>

47  	The plaintiff said that her ambition had been to succeed Mr
Firth as the person in charge of data processing at Makita and
to work until
she was sixty-five.  She said that she was now incapable of working, "because I
am in pain the whole time, because
I can't think straight, because I can't
remember anything, because I can't concentrate on things, because my right arm
stops working
on me.  There's many different reasons".
<P>

48  	At the conclusion of her evidence in chief, after an overnight
adjournment, the plaintiff was asked further questions about
her relationship
with Mr Dormer.  This time she said that there had been incidents of violence,
both before and after the accident,
but "only a couple".  She had not told
anybody except a girlfriend, because she was too embarrassed to tell anybody
else.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Cross-examination</b>
<P>

49  	The plaintiff was cross-examined at length.  I have considered
all of the evidence she gave in cross-examination but I will
not attempt to
refer to all of it in this judgment.
<P>

50  	The plaintiff confirmed that the shoes she was wearing at the
time of the accident had been relatively new shoes.  She had
thought that she
had thrown away the shoes but she had found them in a box of old shoes, when
she was cleaning out a shed.   She
agreed that at the time of the accident the
shoes would have been less worn than they appear now and would have had more
tread.
<P>

51  	The plaintiff agreed that she had not slipped on the stairs on
any occasion before the day of the accident.  She had not gone
back after the
accident and inspected the stairs.  
<P>

52  	The plaintiff claimed that she had slipped on grit on the
stairs, which had fallen from cracks in the walls of the stairway.
 "You could
hear the grit crunching underneath your shoes, when you walked on it".  
<P>

53  	The plaintiff's attention was directed to an affidavit she had
sworn on 20 December 1995 in the District Court, in support
of her application
for an extension of time in which to commence proceedings.  In this affidavit
she had given a detailed account
of the accident but had not mentioned any grit
on the stairs, saying only that the stairs were worn and smooth.
<P>

54  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about why she had not gone to a
doctor, after having the fall and experiencing the symptoms
she claimed she had
experienced.  She replied that she had expected to be sore and bruised and to
have a headache (having been hit
on the head), that she preferred alternative
treatment to treatment by doctors and that previously she had seen doctors only
occasionally.
<P>

55  	The plaintiff gave further evidence about her treatment by
Louise Adam.  On the first occasion, on 10 July 1986, Louise Adam
had performed
a "lumbar roll" and after this treatment the plaintiff was able to stand
straight, although she still had pain in her
back.  The relief the plaintiff
gained from being treated by Louise Adam sometimes lasted only an hour.
Sometimes the relief lasted
until the next day.  Louise Adam allegedly told the
plaintiff that she had "muscle spasms", that, no matter how much Louise Adam
massaged the plaintiff, the plaintiff's joints would keep "locking up" and "I
would need treatment for the rest of my life and I
believed her".
<P>

56  	In a letter of 23 June 1992 to the defendant's insurer Louise
Adam advised that her notes about the plaintiff had been lost.
 The plaintiff
said that she had spoken to Louise Adam just after these proceedings were
commenced and had been informed by Ms Adam
that her notes had been destroyed by
water damage from a storm.
<P>

57  	The plaintiff said that she was not sure whether she had given a
history to Julie Chenery.  She conceded that she was aware
that Julie Chenery
had reported in writing that she was not aware of the plaintiff having suffered
any work injury and that the plaintiff
had given Ms Chenery a history of having
been the victim of domestic violence.  The plaintiff did not know why Julie
Chenery had
written this in her report and had said nothing about the
plaintiff's fall.
<P>

58  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about a history recorded in a
report from Mr Goodrich, in which Mr Goodrich had said:-
<P>

"Ms Sprowles first attended this clinic on 28-7-88 due to symptoms apparently
incurred from being `pushed down on ?? to the top
of my head' causing cervical
spine and headache symptoms, then two weeks later another fall causing lumbar
spine and left leg symptoms.
 All this occurred 2-3 years previous to initial
consultation".
<P>

59  	The plaintiff said that the "fall" referred to in Mr Goodrich's
report (assuming that it was the fall on 30 June 1986) had
occurred, not two
weeks after, but several months after, Mr Dormer had pushed down on the top of
her head.  When asked if she could
explain what Mr Goodrich had written, the
plaintiff said "I'm always told I talk too fast and could I slow down".
According to the
plaintiff's evidence, she had suffered more than lumbar spine
and left leg symptoms as a result of the fall on 30 June 1986.
<P>

60  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about a report from Louise
Weavers in which Ms Weavers said that she had treated the plaintiff
from
January 1989 to June 1989 for a whiplash type injury sustained in a car
accident during November 1988.  The plaintiff said in
her evidence "she (that
is Ms Weavers) wrote some phantom- some car accident that never existed".
<P>

61  	The plaintiff gave further evidence about her work at Makita.
She said that she was physically up and down all day and that
the job demanded
her full attention.  After the accident she had gained significant promotions,
involving more complex duties.  She
had often felt ill at work and had asked Mr
Firth if she could leave work and see an osteopath or a chiropractor.  She
denied that
she had not told Mr Firth until 1988 that she thought that her
health problems were due to the accident.  She had tried to hide her
condition
from people at work, because she did not want it to interfere with her career.

<P>

62  	The plaintiff had been very sick with the glandular fever.  She
was away from work for four weeks.  She then resumed working
but was ill and
was advised by Mr Firth not to come back to work, until she was feeling better.
She resumed working again two weeks
later.  She was excessively tired for a
further two months.  Later in the cross-examination the plaintiff expressed the
opinion that
the condition of fibromyalgia later diagnosed by Dr Wilson had
made her susceptible to getting "a teenage disease" (that is, glandular
fever)
at the age of thirty-four.
<P>

63  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about the sexual harassment by
Mr Weekes and the cessation of her employment.  She left work
because of the
dispute with Mr Weekes and "the fact I was getting worse".  Until the dispute
with Mr Weekes she had not thought of
leaving work.  "I had no intentions of
quitting my job.  I was going to work until I was sixty-five. I wasn't going to
let my sickness
stop me".
<P>

64  	The dispute with Mr Weekes "started a couple of weeks after he
started" and "it gathered momentum until December.  It was just
unbearable".
The dispute with Mr Weekes was "nasty".  Mr Weekes had even threatened physical
violence.  The dispute made the plaintiff
feel worse.  The plaintiff asked Mr
Firth to speak to Mr Weekes.  When Mr Firth refused to speak to Mr Weekes, the
plaintiff said
that she would have to leave.
<P>

65  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about an apparent inconsistency
between her evidence and her affidavit of 20 December 1995.
 In her evidence
she had said that her symptoms had been getting worse in 1991 and 1992.  In her
affidavit she had said that by 19
June 1992 she had felt "there was
improvement, although the rate of improvement was slow".  The plaintiff
maintained that in 1991
and 1992 her symptoms had been getting worse, although
one particular symptom, namely her problems with her right arm, had improved,
because she was no longer required to do data entry work with her right
hand.
<P>

66  	The plaintiff was also cross-examined about parts of her
affidavit of 20 December 1995 in which she had said that she had resigned
as a
result of sexual harassment and had said:-
<P>

"During August 1993 I started to have breathing problems and I could not sleep.
At that time I started to have depression.  My condition
began to deteriorate.
My symptoms no longer waxed and waned".  
<P>

67  	The plaintiff was also cross-examined about a passage in a
report by Dr Wilson of 8 May 1995 in which Dr Wilson said:-
<P>

"Over the period from up until the commencement of the alleged sexual
harassment at work, her symptoms were in fact improving significantly
in
response to osteopathic and other treatment, however, as a result of the marked
increase in psychological stress produced by the
alleged sexual harassment
which commenced in 1992 and by her account was present on a continual basis
over the next twelve months
led to a marked deterioration in her symptoms.  She
stated that the harassment was from one particular male employee and consisted
of lewd and suggestive behaviour, sexually explicit comments and, at times,
overt verbal and physical aggression, such that she actually
felt under threat
of being assaulted.  This harassment was a direct reason for her resignation at
the end of 1992, following which
time she has remained unemployed and unable to
work.  She has been markedly physically incapacitated with continuous disabling
fatigue,
sleep disturbance and resultant  marked functional incapacity".
<P>

68  	It would appear that when the plaintiff saw Dr Wilson she did
not tell Dr Wilson about her glandular fever, that her de facto
husband had
sometimes been physically violent to her or about the termination of her
pregnancy in 1990.  The plaintiff said that
she would have assumed that, as she
had been referred to Dr Wilson by other doctors, Dr Wilson would have been
informed by the doctors
referring her that she had had glandular fever.  
<P>

69  	As regards her relationship with Mr Dormer, the plaintiff
conceded that she had not told the truth on the first day on which
she gave
evidence, when she gave evidence to the effect that Mr Dormer had not hit her.
However, she said that Mr Dormer had struck
her only about ten to twelve times
during the whole relationship, that she had not suffered any serious injury and
that she had not
been in fear of Mr Dormer.
<P>

70  	The plaintiff gave further evidence about the termination of her
pregnancy in 1990.  It was not the first time she had had
an abortion.
However, this time "I was emotionally upset because I wanted to have that child
but my physical condition would not
allow it".
<P>

71  	The plaintiff said that her career had always been her main goal
in life.  Possibly in her mid thirties she would have had
children while
continuing to work.
<P>

72  	The plaintiff could not recall whether she had told Dr Wilson
about the termination of her pregnancy in 1990.  By the time
she first saw Dr
Wilson in January 1994 she had accepted that she was not going to have
children.
<P>

73  	The plaintiff was further cross-examined about the termination
of her pregnancy, after documents had been produced on subpoena
by the Pre-Term
Foundation.  
<P>

74  	Among the documents produced were notes of counselling the
plaintiff had received, which had been signed by the plaintiff.
 These notes
included the following passages;-
<P>

"Vicki is a 34 year old woman with a pregnancy.  She and her partner have ended
their relationship due to this pregnancy"
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"Vicki does not feel that she could cope emotionally and financially with
raising a child on her own".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"She works full-time to cope with her financial commitments and would be unable
to meet these, if the pregnancy were to continue.
 To do so would cause mother
stress, which may lead to regret and resentment late in life.  For her
continuing emotional and mental
well-being a termination of pregnancy is
requested".
<P>

75  	There was no suggestion in the counselling notes that the
plaintiff was having any difficulty in breathing and was frightened
that the
foetus was not getting enough oxygen.  
<P>

76  	The plaintiff conceded that she had lied to the counsellor at
the Pre-Term Foundation.  
<P>

77  	The documents produced by the Pre-Term Foundation also included
a letter the plaintiff had written to the Foundation on 8 August
1996.  In that
letter the plaintiff had said that in 1990 she had doubted that the child would
have been born normal "due to oxygen
deficiency".  In that letter the plaintiff
had also said that there was a chance that information in the Foundation's
records relating
to the plaintiff might be used as evidence in a court case she
was bringing against her former employer.  The Foundation had previously
asked
whether the enquiries the plaintiff was making had anything to do with legal
proceedings.  However, the plaintiff resisted
a suggestion put to her by
counsel for the defendant that in 1996 she was trying "to change history".
<P>

78  	The plaintiff was also asked about her pregnancy termination in
1984.  Mr Dormer had indicated that he would not accept a child
who was not
his.  However, the counselling notes recorded complaints by the plaintiff of
severe abdominal pain and her worry that
something was wrong with the child.
The plaintiff conceded in cross-examination that what she had said about
abdominal pain was not
true.  She asserted that in 1984 it was not easy to
obtain an abortion and a woman had to give a reason which the Foundation would
accept.
<P>

79  	In cross-examination the plaintiff asserted that after the fall
she had developed various skin allergies, which she attributed
to the fall and
which required the use of special soap and shampoo.
<P>

80  	After the fall she had been sensitive to high pitched or loud
noises at work, such as those made by printers, and these noises
had caused her
headaches.
<P>

81  	In 1995 the plaintiff had complained to a Dr Berry that she had
pain in both feet, which required her to walk on the outer
edges of both feet.

<P>

82  	The plaintiff had also complained of a feeling of strangulation.
Her body would swell up, sometimes her whole body and sometimes
only her
stomach.  
<P>

83  	When asked what her present symptoms were, the plaintiff
referred particularly to pain in her right arm and back, dizziness,
coloured
vision, headaches and insomnia.  Her symptoms change on a daily basis.
Whatever she tries to do leads to pain and the pain
is "unbearable".  
<P>

84  	In cross-examination the plaintiff gave further evidence
relevant to her claim for damages for the cost of care.  
<P>

85  	She had told an occupational therapist, Deborah Hammond, and it
was true, that since she returned to live with her mother in
October 1993 her
mother had done everything for her, including cleaning her room, doing her
laundry, doing bathroom cleaning, grocery
shopping (apart from shopping for pet
food for the plaintiff's cats), preparation of meals, dish washing and kitchen
cleaning.  The
plaintiff asserted that she could not prepare meals, because she
could not use her right arm and suffered pain if she stood for long
or bent
down.  
<P>

86  	Deborah Hammond had made various suggestions to the plaintiff,
including preparing meals sitting down, re-arranging cupboards
so that there
was no need to bend and using a microwave, an up-side-down fridge and an
automatic dish washer.  
<P>

87  	The plaintiff said that she did try to do some watering of the
garden.  A couple of times she had done some weeding but had
afterwards
suffered pain.  
<P>

88  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about a number of videos which
had been taken of her.  The videos had been taken on 12 March
1997, 9 and 10
May 1997, 16 July 1997, 16 April 1998 and 17 and 18 November 1999.
<P>

89  	Before the videos were shown to the plaintiff, the plaintiff was
asked to reach up behind her head with her right arm.  She
was very hesitant,
even in lifting her hand off the bench of the witness box, and her hand reached
only about the level of her ear.
 She claimed that performing the action hurt
her.  One of her complaints to Dr Millons had been that it hurt to lift her
right arm
above shoulder height.  She said that, although she is right-handed,
she was trying to use her left hand as much as possible so as
to avoid pain.
The plaintiff could not imagine why she would have held her arms behind her
head (if the video showed her doing that)
but she could have done that, if she
was prepared to put up with the pain or if she was stretching her back. 
<P>

90  	It was put to the plaintiff that she had used a step ladder and
the plaintiff recalled (correctly) an occasion on which her
mother had been
worried that a branch of a tree would come down on the roof of the house and
her mother had asked the plaintiff to
help remove the branch.  It was put to
the plaintiff that she had used a saw with her right arm and she replied that
she had used
her left arm.  The plaintiff claimed "I pushed myself... and paid
for it afterwards".  
<P>

91  	It was put to the plaintiff that she could carry shopping bags
and she replied that she might have been carrying a bag full
of cans of cat
food. 
<P>

92  	The videos were then shown to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff
acknowledged that she was the person shown in the videos.  
<P>

93  	I have viewed all the videos and have taken them all into
account.  It seems to me that the most significant videos are those
of 12 March
1997 and 9 and 10 May 1997.  
<P>

94  	In the video of 12 March 1997 the plaintiff is shown walking a
number of times up a flight of external steps at her home, carrying
a carton in
both arms.  She is shown bending forward from the waist or hips, so that her
head was below the level of her hips.  At
one stage she is shown extending both
arms behind and above her head for a period of many seconds.
<P>

95  	On 9 May 1997 the plaintiff is shown walking, carrying a ladder
and manoeuvring a tree branch with a raised right arm.  She
is shown sawing a
tree branch on the ground, using her right hand and bending forward from her
hips.
<P>

96  	On 16 April 1998 the plaintiff is shown lowering a garage door,
carrying a bag in her right hand and dragging a garbage bin.
 On 18 and 19
November 1999 she is shown squatting and carrying objects with her right hand.
The plaintiff is also shown in one of
the videos as walking, without any
apparent restriction, what appears to be a substantial distance inside and in
the environs of
a shopping centre.
<P>

97  	In further evidence given in cross-examination the plaintiff
claimed that still photographs of her, which were taken from the
video, showed
that her face was "strained" on 12 March 1997.  It seems to me that the still
photographs of the plaintiff's face are
not sufficiently clear to tell whether
there is a strained expression on her face.  The plaintiff claimed that she was
ill for days
afterwards, after helping her mother to deal with the tree branch.
The garage door she was shown as pulling down was at a house where
the
plaintiff kept two cats.  She went to this house each day, carrying bags
containing cat food and wood shavings to put in the
cats' litter trays.
<P>

98  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about what she had told and
what she had been told by various doctors. 
<P>

99  	She had complained to Dr Napoli about gastro-intestinal problems
and had told Dr Napoli that she was drinking ten cups of coffee
a day.  She did
not recall Dr Napoli saying, as, according to a report from Dr Napoli, he had,
that her gastro-intestinal symptoms
and her insomnia might be due to her
caffeine intake.  The plaintiff insisted that her insomnia was caused by
reflux.  She said that
the treatment for reflux she had been given had made her
ten times worse.
<P>

100  	The plaintiff resisted a suggestion that she ignored any advice
from doctors which she did not wish to hear. 
<P>

101  	The plaintiff had vigorously resisted a suggestion made by Dr
Stephen that she would be better assisted by seeing a psychiatrist
than by
seeing a doctor who would treat her for any organic problem she might have.
<P>

102  	Professor Wakefield, to whom the plaintiff was referred by Dr
Batterham, suggested to the plaintiff that if she slept less
during the day,
she might be able to sleep at night.  The plaintiff said that she had tried
"heaps of times" after being awake all
night to stay awake all day but had then
been unable to sleep the following night.  As long as the plaintiff felt pain
she could
not sleep.  When she finally did fall asleep her sleep was
comatose.
<P>

103  	Dr Podgorski in August 1993 had recommended to the plaintiff
that she should try to get fit by walking or doing aerobics.
 The plaintiff
said that she had tried walking with a dog but she could not walk two streets
away and back, without being so exhausted
that she had to lie down for hours.
She could not do aerobic fitness sessions.  The inflammatories prescribed by Dr
Podgorski had
made her a lot worse.  
<P>

104  	The plaintiff gave further evidence about the job she had had
distributing and collecting census forms.  The distribution
of forms involved
walking up to a house, knocking at the door and having a conversation with the
householder, which involved asking
and receiving answers to about five
questions.  The plaintiff suffered pressure in her lower back from the walking
and standing.
 After doing about two or three houses, she had to rest in her
car for half an hour.  
<P>

105  	The plaintiff said that she could not do word processing, even
from home, because of headaches, pain in her right arm, inability
to
concentrate, the need to sit in one spot while working and her sleeplessness.
She was "pain ridden".
<P>

106  	It was put to the plaintiff that she had managed to work
between 1986 and 1992 (subject to the time when she had glandular
fever),
despite having those symptoms and she replied that chronic pain had worn her
down.
<P>

107  	It was put to the plaintiff that she attributed all her
symptoms to the fall in 1986 and she replied:-
<P>

"All the symptoms started then and have continued since then.  What else am I
supposed to do?"
<P>

<b>Plaintiff's Re-examination</b>
<P>

108  	In re-examination the plaintiff said that some of the boxes she
had carried on 12 March 1997 contained only tapestry wools
and were very light.
Some of the other boxes contained legal papers and were quite heavy.  After
carrying the boxes she had felt
awful.  
<P>

109  	The plaintiff said that she had held her arms up, as shown in
the video, because she was stretching her back after bending.
 On that day she
had not been feeling too bad.  However, she was in pain while helping her
mother and the next four or five days
she was "virtually flat on (her) back".
She felt pain closing the garage door but it took only a second to close it.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's other Witnesses</b>
<P>

110  	The plaintiff's mother, Mrs Loris Sprowles, gave brief evidence
on which she was not cross-examined.  Mrs Sprowles said that
while she was
living at Castle Hill and the plaintiff was living at Kenthurst, the plaintiff
used to call in to see her three or
four days a week, when coming home from
work.  While the plaintiff was still working for Makita, the plaintiff had
complained to
her mother that "she had a bad back and was suffering from a bad
neck, down her throat... weakness in one arm, dizziness, loss of
memory,
couldn't concentrate".  The plaintiff was "very drawn and sallow".  She was
"not well".  
<P>

111  	In October 1993 the plaintiff came to her mother's place and
said that she could not look after herself.  Over the last six
years the
plaintiff has "not (been) a well girl at all".  "She doesn't eat, she doesn't
sleep, makes very little contact with people
outside.. no social
activities".
<P>

112  	Lois Dinuzzo gave evidence that she had worked at AEWL with the
plaintiff for seven or eight years from 1973 onwards.  During
this period the
plaintiff had not complained about, and did not appear to be suffering from,
any physical symptoms.  
<P>

113  	Ms Dinuzzo said that she had received a telephone call from the
plaintiff, which she placed "towards the end of 1986.  I am
just going by the
ages of my children".  The plaintiff had said in the telephone call that she
did not feel like her normal self,
that her body was hurting and that she had
trouble sleeping.  Subsequently, the plaintiff and Ms Dinuzzo communicated with
each other
by telephone.  Ms Dinuzzo saw the plaintiff again but could not
recall when.  She had since seen the plaintiff about half a dozen
times.  She
had noticed changes in the plaintiff from when the plaintiff worked at AEWL.
The plaintiff was depressed, was not free
in her movements and did not look
well. 
<P>

114  	In cross-examination Ms Dinuzzo said that she had first made a
statement to the plaintiff's solicitors in 1998.  She was unable
to explain how
the ages of her children helped her to date the telephone call which she had
received from the plaintiff.  She did
not know the exact date of the telephone
call and in effect conceded that the plaintiff or her solicitors might have
suggested to
her that the call was in 1986.  
<P>

115  	Georgina Morgan gave evidence that she had lived with the
plaintiff and Mr Dormer at Kenthurst for four months from February
1986 to
early June 1986.  During this period the plaintiff was physically fine, she
undertook normal household duties, for example
cooking, ironing and washing,
and went to work every day.
<P>

116  	Ms Morgan ceased living with the plaintiff in June 1986.  About
a year later the plaintiff telephoned her "out of the blue".
 Ms Morgan saw the
plaintiff again in Sydney towards the end of 1987.  The plaintiff said "that
she was in a lot of pain, her back
and neck and head were causing pain and she
was having a lot of treatment done for her condition".  The plaintiff had
changed in
appearance.  She looked "quite haggard and not very well".
<P>

117  	Subsequently the plaintiff and Ms Morgan spoke on the telephone
every few months.  The plaintiff said much the same thing,
that she was in a
lot of pain, that she was trying various treatments and that she was not
sleeping well.
<P>

118  	Ms Morgan came back to live in Sydney in about 1989.  She had
seen the plaintiff three or four times since 1989. Each time
the plaintiff
looked unwell, if not worse.
<P>

119  	There was little cross-examination of Ms Morgan.
<P>

120  	Natalie Blanch gave evidence that she had worked at Makita as a
data entry processor under the supervision of the plaintiff
for three months
between August 1987 and November 1987.  She was then seventeen years old.  
<P>

121  	During this period she noticed that, after the plaintiff had
been sitting for a while at her computer, the plaintiff would
stand up and
stretch her back.  The plaintiff told Ms Blanch that she had had a fall down
stairs at work.  The plaintiff said that
she was going to an osteopath.  
<P>

122  	Ms Blanch said that she had used the stairs to move from one
floor to another in the building at Gladesville.  She said "the
brick walls
were all cracked and it was very dusty".  She said that she herself had almost
slipped a few times.
<P>

123  	For three weeks to a month in October 1987 Ms Blanch had lived
in the same house as the plaintiff and Mr Dormer.  There was
a happy
relationship between the plaintiff and Mr Dormer, so far as she could see.  Mr
Dormer did domestic tasks.  The plaintiff
did not do much at all.  "I only ever
saw her feed the animals, water the garden, that was it".  The plaintiff had
said that she
had a lot of trouble doing everyday household tasks.
<P>

124  	In cross-examination Ms Blanch said that she had first been
asked to recall what had happened in 1987, some time in 1999.
 She said that
she had complained to the plaintiff and other female employees about almost
slipping on the stairs but had not complained
to Mr Firth.  
<P>

125  	The plaintiff relied on expert scientific evidence by Associate
Professor D H Morton in order to establish liability.  A report
by Professor
Morton dated 18 December 1995 was admitted into evidence.
<P>

126  	Professor Morton visited the premises at Gladesville on 11
December 1995, accompanied by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff brought
with her
the shoes she said she had been wearing at the time of the accident, one of
which was the shoe identified by her when she
gave her evidence.  
<P>

127  	I have read all of Professor Morton's report.  Parts of the
report are as follows:-
<P>

"The usual measure of `slipperiness' is its inverse, the coefficient of
friction.  This is the sideways force needed to cause an
object to slide on a
surface..."
<P>

"There is a further complication in the circumstances of a person walking.  The
force needed to keep an object sliding once it has
started (the `dynamic'
coefficient) may be less and sometimes much less than that needed to start the
movement in the first place
(the `static' coefficient)...."
<P>

"Whilst there are no universally agreed standards for floor friction, it is
usually accepted that dynamic friction coefficients
below 0.4 are unsafe,
whereas above 0.5 they are safe..."
<P>

"I understand that the weather was fine and dry at the time and that, so far as
Ms Sprowles was aware, there was no contamination
or other adventitious
material on the surface of the stairs..."
<P>

"The stairs are constructed of reinforced cast concrete.  The tread surfaces
appear to have received what is generally known as
a wet steel trowel finish.
This involves trowelling the wet partly-set concrete with a smooth steel tool,
often with the addition
of further dry cement to achieve a hard, dense and very
smooth surface..."
<P>

"It should be noted also that, as inspected, I found that the stairs carried
loose particles of sandy or powdery materials.  I have
discounted these for the
purposes of measurement.  However, it is well-established in my experience that
on hard smooth surfaces
the presence of loose particulate material can create
severe slipperiness due to the tendency of the particles to roll under foot.
 I
have investigated many accidents caused by this effect.  It is recalled that at
the time of the accident it is said that the building
structure was cracking.
It is reasonable to believe that significant quantities of sandy particulate
material from cracking bricks,
mortar or concrete could have found its way to
the tread surfaces.  If this was the case, in my opinion there can be no real
doubt
that the smooth stair treads would have been very dangerously
slippery".
<P>

128  	Professor Morton performed tests to ascertain the coefficients
of friction of various surfaces in relation to the fire stairs.
 He found the
following result for the plaintiff's shoe:-
<P>

<center>                   Static                   Dynamic
<P>

Sole            45                          34
<P>

Heel           56                          53</center>
<P>


<P>

129  	The conclusions stated by Professor Morton in his report
included the following:-
<P>

"6.3 The tread surfaces are very smooth and are not provided with a non-slip
finish throughout, as is required by Ordinance 70.
 Neither are they fitted
with non-skid strips near the edge of the nosings, as required by Ordinance 70
as an alternative provision.
<P>

6.4 In the clean, dry condition the treads are adequately slip-resistant for
safety, only for footwear of inherently high-grip materials.
<P>

6.5 For other common footwear, including the shoes worn by Ms Sprowles, the
treads are sufficiently slippery to be dangerous, even
when clean and dry and
would be very dangerous when wet or if contaminated by loose powdery
materials.
<P>

6.6 The dangerous condition of the treads could have been avoided easily and at
low cost, by the use of a wood-float or cross-brushed
finish to the concrete
treads or the application of abrasive non-skid strips to the tread noses.  The
use of both provisions would
have been preferable and in my experience would
have been the usual practice in the industry at the time.
<P>

6.7 The accident to Ms Sprowles was caused by the dangerously slippery
condition of the stairs provided for her use, in footwear
such as she would
reasonably have been expected to wear in the circumstances."
<P>

130  	In oral evidence in chief Professor Morton said that, of the
two coefficients of friction, the dynamic coefficient of friction
was the more
relevant, because it was a measure of resistance to sliding, once sliding had
commenced.  "The static (friction) would
be overcome by a twisting of the foot
and so all that is left is the dynamic friction".
<P>

131  	Powdery materials of all sorts on a smooth surface would reduce
the coefficient of friction.  On a stairwell such as this
there would be likely
to be powdery materials of various sorts, for example mortar, crumbled brick or
crumbled cement.  
<P>

132  	In cross-examination Professor Morton confirmed that the
plaintiff had informed him at the time of their inspection that,
so far as she
was aware, there had been no "adventitious material" (which would have included
any material falling from the cracks
in the walls) at the time of the accident.
At the time of Professor Morton's inspection "there was no particularly heavy
layer of
loose particles".  The plaintiff had been with him when those loose
particles were "uncovered".  "One ought not to over-emphasise
the quantities
present;  there was some present".  Professor Morton discounted the presence of
loose particles on the stairs at the
time of the accident, because "as far as
she was aware she did not slip on any contamination" and because "if one starts
speculating
on the amount of sandy material and what type would have been
present, you can get almost any answer you like".
<P>

133  	With regard to the plaintiff's shoe, Professor Morton said that
the heel and the sole (that is the sole apart from the heel)
were made of the
same material but the coefficients of friction of the heel and the sole were
different, because the sole was smoother
than the heel.  In walking down steps
the toe of the shoe goes down first, before the heel.  If the plaintiff's shoe
had been worn
after the accident, the coefficients of friction at the time of
the accident could have been different from the results obtained
by Professor
Morton.  Professor Morton had assumed "that the shoe had not been significantly
worn since the accident".
<P>

134  	In further cross-examination Professor Morton agreed that a
coefficient of friction is not normally dependent on the pressure
exerted on a
surface.
<P>

135  	The only medical evidence adduced by the plaintiff consisted of
reports and oral evidence by Dr Andrew Wilson, a consultant
psychiatrist.
<P>

136  	The plaintiff was first seen by Dr Wilson on 21 January 1994
and he had seen her a number of times since.  The plaintiff had
been referred
to Dr Wilson by Professor Wakefield. 
<P>

137  	Dr Wilson's first report was made on 8 May 1995.  I have
already quoted a part of this report in which Dr Wilson recorded
a history that
the plaintiff's symptoms had been improving until the sexual harassment had
occurred.  In his report Dr Wilson said
inter alia:-
<P>

"On my initial assessment in January 1994, subsequently confirmed by my
re-evaluation on 2/5/95, I felt that the most appropriate
diagnosis was one of
fibromyalgia, which is a well recognised disorder, categorised by a generalised
pain syndrome, fatigue and sleep
disturbance.  This can occur without any clear
precipitant but also can develop following physical trauma, such as a fall or
other
accident and, for many patients, is also significantly worsened by
psychological stress of one sort or another.  In my opinion, the
stress Ms
Sprowles suffered as a result of the alleged sexual harassment at work
significantly influenced the resultant poor course
of her illness, and her
illness would seem to have been precipitated by a fall at work in 1986".
<P>

138  	Dr Wilson said that he could not prescribe anti-depressants
because the plaintiff had reacted adversely in the past to anti-depressants.
He said that "other treatments suggested involved rehabilitative approaches and
stress management".  Dr Wilson continued:-
<P>

"Based on her current condition, level of symptomatology and resultant
disability, it is likely that she will remain significantly
functionally
impaired in the foreseeable future.  Ongoing treatment such as manipulative
therapy for her back problems and treatment
of a counselling nature may
certainly be required as a result of her condition.  She is currently not fit
for employment, which is
clearly a significant change from her capacity to work
prior to the commencement of the said sexual harassment on the 6/1/92.
Overall,
I would be guarded about her prognosis and would feel at this point is
unlikely that her symptoms will significantly improve in the
foreseeable future
with little likelihood of her being able to return to any useful
employment".
<P>

139  	In a report of 1 November 1996, following a review of the
plaintiff in October 1996, Dr Wilson said that the plaintiff had
not improved
since he had last seen her and in many ways she had deteriorated, reporting
particularly generalised pain, sleep disturbance,
fatigue, muscle spasms,
headaches, visual disturbance and "a heightened general arousal" (that is
increased sensitivity to pain).
 Dr Wilson's diagnosis remained that of
fibromyalgia.  He said:-
<P>

"I believe it is extremely unlikely that Ms Sprowles' condition will improve to
any great extent".
<P>

140  	In Dr Wilson's opinion the plaintiff was not fit for any kind
of work.  In answer to a question "the possibility that such
disabilities may
be referable to causes other than the said incidents of 30 June 1986 and 10
July 1986 and if so to what?" Dr Wilson
responded:-
<P>

"The likelihood of other factors being involved in the production of Miss
Sprowles' symptoms would appear to be unlikely.  Prior
to the work accident of
30th June 1986 there was no formal history of psychiatric disorder, nor any
history of drug or alcohol abuse
or any other psychiatric symptomatology.
There was also no history of any significant medical illness prior to this
disorder.  I
therefore do not find that there is any other acceptable
explanation for the development of Miss Sprowles' symptoms".
<P>

141  	In a report of 21 July 1998 Dr Wilson said inter alia:-
<P>

"Ms Sprowles remains severely incapacitated by her symptoms.  She is not fit
for any form of work.  Ms Sprowles is also unable to
manage basic activities of
daily living.  She is unable to wash, cook, shop or generally look after
herself.  These activities are
carried out by Ms Sprowles' mother.  Should Ms
Sprowles' mother not be available to carry out these activities, Ms Sprowles
would
be unable to care for herself independently.  I would estimate that, in
order to assist Ms Sprowles carry out these activities of
daily living in the
absence of her mother, care would be required at approximately two hours per
day indefinitely".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>

"At this stage I would see Ms Sprowles being permanently disabled.  There has
been no improvement in her symptoms over the time
course I have reviewed her
and therefore I do not believe that she is fit for employment in any capacity
at present, nor is it likely
to be the case on a permanent basis.  I believe
that her symptoms will continue at their current level, although there may be
some
mild fluctuation from time to time".
<P>

142  	In a report of 15 February 1999 Dr Wilson said inter alia:-
<P>

"Fibromyalgia is a disorder of unknown etiology causing a circumscribed set of
symptoms, namely: muscle pain, joint pain, impaired
concentration and memory,
sleep disturbance, fatigue and to a varying extent anxiety and depression,
irritable bowel symptomatology,
paraesthesia, visual disturbance and other
somatic complaints...
<P>

The signs and symptoms are noted above.  This disorder can commence suddenly or
gradually and with or without defined physical or
psychological stressors.  For
the majority of sufferers it is long lasting and the prognosis is usually poor.
Its usual effect is
to significantly impair activities of daily living and
function, which has definitely been the case in Ms Sprowles case".
<P>

To the best of my knowledge Ms Sprowles did have these signs and symptoms
between June 30, 1986 to May 1995.
<P>

She did not have these symptoms before June 30, 1986.
<P>

Fibromyalgia, whilst not a difficult disorder to diagnose, is poorly recognised
and the symptomatology is often either confused
with other disorders, ignored
or considered not of clinical significance.
<P>

It is extremely common that patients who suffer with this condition have
difficulty getting the right diagnosis.  A typical history
both in the
literature and in my own experience is that patients often see a significant
number of medical practitioners or other
health practitioners, prior to the
correct diagnosis being made".
<P>

143  	In oral evidence in chief Dr Wilson said that fibromyalgia had
been a specific area of interest for him and that he had conducted
research
into fibromyalgia for the last ten years.  
<P>

144  	Dr Wilson was cross-examined at some length.  He said in
cross-examination that fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome
are slightly
different but overlap and are of unknown etiology "as a general rule".  
<P>

145  	A small percentage of people who have had glandular fever
develop chronic fatigue syndrome but the majority do not.  It was
possible
that, if the plaintiff had had glandular fever in 1989, that could have
contributed to her present condition.  There may
be several factors "along the
way" contributing to fibromyalgia.  If the plaintiff had had symptoms of
fibromyalgia before she had
the glandular fever, the glandular fever could not
have been "the cause" of the fibromyalgia.
<P>

146  	Stressful conditions can cause fibromyalgia.  Dr Wilson had
obtained a history from the plaintiff that her father had died
after a long
illness, that the plaintiff had been under stress at work and that a
relationship she had been in had broken up.
<P>

147  	According to Dr Wilson's notes, he had been told by the
plaintiff that the relationship with her de facto husband had been
"difficult"
but not that it had been "abusive", in the sense of involving physical
violence.  If the plaintiff had been occasionally
hit by her partner that would
be a significant matter.  However, it might be splitting hairs to attempt to
distinguish between a
relationship which was "difficult" and a relationship
which was "abusive".  
<P>

148  	Dr Wilson had no record of the termination of the plaintiff's
pregnancy in 1990.  How stressful that event would have been
for her would have
depended on the circumstances.  The termination of a pregnancy by a woman who
had been diagnosed as having endometriosis
and who had at least initially
welcomed the pregnancy, could have been a significant matter.  
<P>

149  	Dr Wilson said:-
<P>

"I think typically people with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, it's
highly unusual to see somebody where there is absolutely
one categorical
discrete cause;  it's a matter of attribution to what factors various people
have in their lives, including physical
or psychological events which can
contribute".
<P>

150  	It would be unusual, however, if a person in histories given by
her did not refer to a fall (if a fall was a causative factor)
but to a history
of domestic violence.  
<P>

151  	It was put to Dr Wilson that the plaintiff had claimed "a
constellation of quite bizarre symptoms".  Dr Wilson replied:-
<P>

"..if one examines and takes a history from 500 patients with this type of
disorder you will find those types of symptoms are present
in 20 to 30 per cent
of them with variable frequency".
<P>

152  	These symptoms would include visual disturbance and a sensation
of choking.
<P>

153  	It would be "uncommon" but not "unusual" for a person with
chronic fatigue syndrome (or fibromyalgia) to work on for six years,
after
contracting the condition.
<P>

154  	Dr Wilson accepted that his views depended on accepting the
plaintiff as a witness of truth about her symptoms.  He had received
a history
that the plaintiff had had symptoms since 1986 and that in 1993 her symptoms
had become chronic and unremitting.  If the
plaintiff is in fact able to do
things which she claimed to Dr Wilson she could not do, then Dr Wilson would
doubt the level of the
symptoms claimed and ultimately would doubt the
diagnosis of fibromyalgia itself.
<P>

155  	In re-examination Dr Wilson said that the level of disability
experienced by a person with fibromyalgia varies from time to
time.  With
regard to the plaintiff continuing to work, Dr Wilson said:-
<P>

"...often people focus on one aspect of their life that remains highly
functional and put all their eggs in one basket.  People
can function at work
but other aspects of life they are actually functioning very poorly.  That's
not an unusual situation and I
think that could well be the case here"
<P>

156  	Dr Wilson was asked:-
<P>

"If she endured fibromyalgia between 1986 and 1992, would she have been more or
less susceptible to being able to endure the sexual
harassment she suffered at
work in 1992?"
<P>

Dr Wilson responded:-
<P>

"It's a very difficult question...  so if someone is burdened by significant
stress or being ill, those things could punch above
their weight..."
<P>

<b>The Defendant's Witnesses</b>
<P>

157  	The only witnesses who gave oral evidence for the defendant
were Mr Firth and Dr Millons.
<P>

158  	In his evidence in chief Mr Firth said that he had been the
electronic data processing manager for Makita.  In 1986 there
had been four
people in the division.  These included the plaintiff, who was the second in
charge of the division.
<P>

159  	The plaintiff had told him some time in 1986 that she had had a
fall on the stairs coming to work.  Mr Firth had himself used
the stairs
regularly.  He had never found the stairs slippery.  
<P>

160  	Mr Firth had become aware that the plaintiff was attending an
osteopath.  According to Mr Firth, the plaintiff had said "it
was something to
do with a fall from a horse".  
<P>

161  	Towards the end of 1991 the plaintiff had told him that she was
going to make a claim.  
<P>

162  	In 1992 there had been friction between the plaintiff and
another employee.  Between 1986 and 1992 the plaintiff did her work
in the
normal manner.
<P>

163  	In cross-examination Mr Firth said that the plaintiff had been
a good worker and a competent supervisor.  When asked whether
the plaintiff
could have done Mr Firth's job as electronic data processing manager after his
retirement (Mr Firth retired in 1995),
Mr Firth replied that "she was capable
of doing the job, (but) not capable of handling people".
<P>

164  	Mr Firth said that the concrete stairs merely accessed the car
park and that there were internal stairs for persons moving
within the
building.  
<P>

165  	Mr Firth confirmed that acrimony had developed between the
plaintiff and Mr Weekes and that the relationship between the plaintiff
and Mr
Weekes had deteriorated during 1992.  Mr Weekes and the plaintiff had sat at
two desks outside Mr Firth's office within view
of Mr Firth.
<P>

166  	Dr Millons is a specialist in orthopaedics.  He saw the
plaintiff for medico/legal purposes on 13 November 1996 and furnished
a report
dated 19 November 1996.  
<P>

167  	In his report Dr Millons expressed inter alia the following
opinions:-
<P>

"I can really find little convincing evidence to substantiate Miss Sprowles'
complaints of continuing neck, back, upper and lower
limb disability, 10 years
after a fall down some stairs.  She admits she has difficulty explaining her
symptoms, so do I.
<P>

She could have sustained some contusion of her back when she fell down the
stairs but one would have expected symptoms to have settled
within a few weeks
at most.  Indeed, she does not appear to have lost any time from work over the
ensuing years nor sought any medical
attention.  She relied on chiropractic and
osteopathic treatment in the early days.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"Somewhere along the way she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, a
condition which has its supporters and doubters.  She
claims to have been
getting worse since that condition was diagnosed in September 1993.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"Just now her neck exhibits a reasonably good range of movements.  Some minimal
stiffness there might reflect the relative period
of inactivity.  Her
thoraco-lumbar spine exhibits a good range of movements.  There is no
convincing evidence of any frank nerve
root irritation or neurological deficit
in either upper limb and all in all I do not believe her problems can be
explained on orthopaedic
grounds and I cannot really believe they relate either
to the fall down the stairs in June 1986 or to the nature and conditions of
her
work thereafter.  If she does have some vague rheumatological problems, then
they would not appear to be work related".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

Orthopaedically there should be no reason to put any restriction on her.  Her
perception of invalidity on whatever grounds would
appear to be considerably
greater than real and under those circumstances an early return to the
work-force in any capacity would
seem unlikely".
<P>

168  	In oral evidence Dr Millons said about fibromyalgia and chronic
fatigue syndrome:-
<P>

"I suppose there is a connection between the two, I am not sure that either is
founded in any definite facts.  Often they are used
for someone who has
widespread pain but you can't find any cause.  Chronic fatigue syndrome again
is another condition which has
its supporters and doubters".
<P>

A little later in his evidence Dr Millons said:-
<P>

"I suppose being an orthopaedic surgeon and a surgeon I am more of a scientist
and I like to see definite evidence of incapacity,
that I can relate to the
condition".
<P>

169  	In cross-examination Dr Millons said that he did not believe
that either chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia really exist.
 He was
aware that work had been done in the United States on fibromyalgia by
rheumatologists and psychiatrists.  Dr Millons had
not made any study of this
research.  He accepted that "you (that is Dr Millons) don't know where science
is up to, because you have
made no study of it".  He also accepted that "there
is a respected body of medical opinion that asserts that fibromyalgia is a real
condition". Dr Millons would not defer to that body of opinion.  As an
orthopaedic surgeon he could find nothing within his discipline
which would
explain the plaintiff's problems.
<P>

170  	The duration of the plaintiff's complaints (thirteen years) and
her continuing to work between 1986 and 1992 would militate
against the
plaintiff being a malinger.
<P>

171  	The plaintiff's complaints of pain might be psychiatrically
based.  He said "I accept she has pain.  I find no orthopaedic
basis for
complaints of pain".
<P>

172  	Dr Millons considered that the amount of treatment the
plaintiff had received had been extraordinary and self-generating.
<P>

173  	A large number of reports by paramedicals who had treated the
plaintiff were tendered by the defendant.  I have already referred
to parts of
those reports in which histories given by the plaintiff were recorded.
<P>

174  	The defendant also tendered a number of reports by doctors.
Some of these doctors had been treating specialists to whom the
plaintiff had
been referred.
<P>

175  	Dr Podgorski, rheumatologist, saw the plaintiff in about August
1993.  His "impression" was:-
<P>

"She certainly has many complaints and very few physical abnormalities present
on examination...  if these (certain tests) prove
unremarkable, it is most
likely she has a variant of fibromyalgia syndrome.  A return to aerobic fitness
is essential...  it may
be worth exploring relaxation therapy, psychological
factors in the perpetuation of her pain".
<P>

176  	Dr Napoli, gastroenterologist, who saw the plaintiff in July
1994 concluded:-
<P>

"In summary, Vicki may definitely have some problems with peptic ulceration and
reflux oesophagitis.  She is very resistant to the
idea that smoking and coffee
intake are associated with this.  I tried to introduce the idea that perhaps a
lot of her symptoms are
made significantly worse by the stresses that she is
currently under.  She seemed to think that all of her problems were organic
and
did not feel that stress was a significant factor.  I plan to perform a
gastroscopy on Vicki to assess the state of her upper
gastrointestinal tract
but I feel that even if we find significant pathology and treat it, Vicki
requires a great deal more help
at the psychological level".
<P>

177  	Dr Stephen, a specialist in orthopaedics, who saw the plaintiff
in July 1995 concluded:-
<P>

"It is quite evident that most of Miss Sprowles's symptoms are flagrantly
neurotic.  She really does require the help of a psychiatrist.
 When I broached
this, as gently as I could, she denied any non-organic element with
considerable vigour".
<P>

178  	Dr Fearnside, a neurological surgeon who saw the plaintiff in
December 1995, thought that the plaintiff had "multiple psychological
problems
underlying the gross somatisation of what appears to be a mixture of anxiety
and depression".
<P>

179  	Dr Terenty, a physician who saw the plaintiff for medico/legal
purposes on behalf of the defendant in November 1996, considered
that some of
the plaintiff's symptoms were bizarre, that she had a fixation regarding the
organic basis of her symptomatology, that
Dr Terenty could find no evidence of
any abnormality that could be connected to the accident on 30 June 1986 and
that the plaintiff
had a significant psychiatric disorder.
<P>

180  	In 1997 the plaintiff was seen for medico/legal purposes by Dr
John Shand, psychiatrist.  Dr Shand considered that "if the
history can be
taken at face value, the diagnosis is either somatization disorder or
undifferentiated somatoform disorder".
<P>

181  	In a later report Dr Shand said that he was in full agreement
with the view that "this lady has a significant psychiatric
disorder".  In this
report Dr Shand referred to the various histories which the plaintiff had
given.  Dr Shand concluded:-
<P>

"There appears to be support for a diagnosis of significant psychiatric
disorder, if the history is accepted at face value.  This
does not exclude the
possibility of consciously motivated complaints".
<P>

182  	Dr Shand later conducted a physical examination of the
plaintiff.  He found that some of the results "contrasted significantly
with
her ability (when not being actually tested) to walk normally and generally
move without restriction or signs of discomfort".
 Most of the plaintiff's
complaints could have no connection in a physical sense with the accident on 30
June 1986.
<P>

<b>Credibility of the Witnesses </b>
<P>

183  	The extent to which the plaintiff's evidence should be accepted
is obviously crucial to a determination of this case.  There
was no witness,
other than the plaintiff, to the alleged fall on 30 June 1986.  Professor
Morton's conclusions were based on information
supplied by the plaintiff that
the shoes she produced to him were the shoes she had been wearing at the time
of the accident and
that she had not worn the shoes much after the accident.
There is little or no orthopaedic evidence to support the plaintiff's
complaints
of the symptoms and disabilities she says she has experienced.
There is no evidence from Louise Adam, who was the first person to
treat the
plaintiff after the alleged accident, except a letter saying that Ms Adam's
notes about the plaintiff have been lost. 
The only medical evidence adduced on
behalf of the plaintiff is the evidence of Dr Wilson, who first saw the
plaintiff in January
1994, more than seven years after the accident.  Dr Wilson
accepted that the views he had formed depended on his accepting the plaintiff
as a witness of truth about her symptoms.  If the plaintiff is in fact able to
do things which she claimed to Dr Wilson she could
not do, then Dr Wilson would
have to doubt the level of symptoms claimed by the plaintiff and, ultimately,
even his diagnosis of
fibromyalgia.  There are other reasons as well why the
plaintiff's evidence is important.  
<P>

184  	A strong attack was mounted by counsel for the defendant on the
credibility of the plaintiff.  Grounds for attacking the plaintiff's
credibility include the following.  
<P>

185  	The plaintiff admitted that she had lied in part of her
evidence.  She initially denied that there had been any intentional
acts of
violence by Mr Dormer during their relationship.  The breaking of her nose by
Mr Dormer had been an accident.  Later in the
plaintiff's evidence in chief she
admitted that there had been incidents of violence, both before and after the
accident, but "only
a couple".  In cross-examination the plaintiff admitted
that Mr Dormer had struck her ten to twelve times during the relationship.
 
<P>

186  	The plaintiff admitted that she had told lies out of court, for
example, in complaining in 1984 to a counsellor at the Pre-Term
Foundation that
she had abdominal pain.  
<P>

187  	The plaintiff gave some evidence which was inconsistent with
previous out of court statements she had made.  For example,
she said in her
evidence that her pregnancy had been terminated in 1990 because she was having
problems with her breathing, whereas
she had told a counsellor in 1990 that she
felt she could not cope emotionally and financially with raising a child on her
own, after
her relationship with her partner had ended.  The plaintiff had not
mentioned to the counsellor any problems with her breathing.
 Furthermore, the
plaintiff had said in her affidavit of 20 December 1995 that her problems with
her breathing had started in August
1993.  The plaintiff said in her evidence
that there was grit on the stairs at the time of the accident, whereas she had
informed
Professor Morton at the time of their inspection on 11 December 1995
that, so far as she was aware, there was "no contamination or
other
adventitious material on the surface of the stairs".  She said in her evidence
that she was getting worse in 1991 and 1992,
which was contrary to what she had
said in her affidavit of 20 December 1995 and what she had told Dr Wilson.  
<P>

188  	It was submitted by counsel for the defendant that the
plaintiff had exaggerated in her evidence.  A notable example was that
the
plaintiff had exaggerated the difficulty she claimed she had in raising her
right arm.  In one of the videos the plaintiff was
shown as extending her right
arm vertically above and behind her head and maintaining that position for many
seconds, without any
apparent difficulty or any apparent discomfort.  Dr Shand
said in his last report that some of the results he obtained on his physical
examination of the plaintiff contrasted significantly with her ability, when
not actually being tested but while still being observed
by Dr Shand, to move
without restriction or signs of discomfort.  
<P>

189  	It was also submitted that the plaintiff had attempted to mould
parts of the evidence in such a way as to advance her case.
 An example was her
evidence about there having been grit on the stairs at the time of the
accident.  It was submitted that the plaintiff
had given this evidence, because
she had been asked about the subject by Professor Morton at the time of the
inspection and had come
to appreciate that evidence from her that there was
grit on the stairs would assist her case.  Another example was her letter
written
to the Pre-Term Foundation in August 1996, seeking, six years after her
pregnancy had been terminated, to supply an ex post facto
reason for the
termination which would assist her case. 
<P>

190  	Counsel for the defendant pointed to the histories given by the
plaintiff to some of her early carers, in which she had given
a history of some
incident or incidents other than, or as well as, the fall.  The plaintiff had
given Julie Chenery a history of
having been the victim of domestic violence.
The first item of history recorded by Mr Goodrich in his report was that the
plaintiff
had been pushed down on the top of her head.  Louise Weavers recorded
a history of a car accident in November 1988, which the plaintiff
in her
evidence denied had ever happened.  It was submitted that the plaintiff's
attempts to explain why these histories had been
recorded were unconvincing.
Even Mr Firth said that the plaintiff had said to him that she had had a fall
from a horse.
<P>

191  	It was submitted that the incident of the pushing down on the
plaintiff's head was particularly important.  It was the first
item of history
recorded by Mr Goodrich in his report.  Moreover, Mr Goodrich recorded that he
had been told that it had happened
two weeks before the "fall".  When the
plaintiff initially gave evidence about this incident of Mr Dormer pushing down
on her head,
she said that it had happened about two weeks before the accident
on 30 June 1986.  Then she changed her evidence to saying that
it had happened
two weeks before her birthday on 14 October 1985.
<P>

192  	It was also submitted that the plaintiff had fixed ideas and
had closed her mind about her medical condition and what had
caused it.
Everything, even catching glandular fever in 1989, was attributed by the
plaintiff to fibromyalgia resulting from her
fall.  Any medical opinion or any
medical advice which did not fit in with her fixed ideas about her condition
and its cause was
disregarded by her.
<P>

193  	It is clear that the plaintiff did, in one part of her
evidence, lie and that she has lied out of court.  I accept that some
of her
evidence was inconsistent with previous out of court statements she had made
and I reject those parts of her evidence.  I
also accept that the plaintiff
exaggerated in parts of her evidence, that she made some attempts to mould the
evidence in such a
way as to advance her case and that the plaintiff has fixed
ideas about her condition and what caused it.
<P>

194  	I give weight to the submissions made concerning the histories
given by the plaintiff.  However, I note, as against the points
made by counsel
for the defendant, that Mr Goodrich did refer in his report to "a fall" as
being part of the history given to him;
 that Louise Weavers said quite
explicitly in her report that, apart from the whiplash injury for which Ms
Weavers was treating the
plaintiff, the plaintiff said she had low back and
left leg pain for which she was being treated by other practitioners, being an
osteopath and a chiropractor;  and that Anne Petrie said in her report "the
history given was onset of symptoms occurred after falling
at work on 30 June
1986".  I do not give any weight to Mr Firth's rather vague evidence that the
plaintiff had said that her condition
"was something to do with a fall from a
horse".  The only evidence of a fall from a horse is of a fall in about 1971.
I accept generally
that it is likely that the plaintiff was asked by those from
whom she sought treatment whether she could remember any incident which
could
have contributed to her condition.
<P>

195  	I have concluded that the incident in which Mr Dormer pressed
down on the plaintiff's head did involve more physical force
than the plaintiff
conceded in her evidence.  
<P>

196  	Despite these well founded criticisms of the plaintiff's
credibility, I have concluded that she was not generally malingering
and I have
also concluded that I should accept most of her evidence, even though rejecting
some parts and discounting some other
parts to some extent as being
exaggerated.  I have explicitly referred in this part of my judgment to most
parts of the plaintiff's
evidence which I have decided I should reject.
<P>

197  	Objective matters which lend support to the general tenor of
the plaintiff's evidence include that she had worked virtually
continuously
from about 1971 up to June 1986;  that she was clearly ambitious to succeed in
her career;  that prior to 30 June 1986
she had made few if any complaints and
had sought very little medical or paramedical attention;  that commencing from
10 July 1986
the plaintiff constantly over many years and at considerable
expense to herself sought paramedical attention;  that the plaintiff
continued
working from 1986 to 1992, although constantly seeking and receiving treatment;
that the plaintiff made a formal claim
for compensation in late 1991, before Mr
Weekes commenced employment with Makita and hence before the sexual harassment
started.
<P>

198  	The plaintiff's evidence is corroborated in a number of
respects by the evidence of her mother, Lois Dinuzzo, Georgina Morgan
and
Natalie Blanch.  I generally accept the evidence of those witnesses, except
that I do not accept that Ms Dinuzzo had any real
recollection that the
telephone call she received from the plaintiff was "towards the end of 1986"
and I do not accept Ms Blanch's
evidence about the state of the concrete stairs
in the building at Gladesville.  Her evidence that she had used the concrete
stairs
to go from one floor to another in the building seems to be inconsistent
with the evidence of Mr Firth, whose recollection would
be likely to be
accurate, that there were internal stairs for persons moving from one floor to
another within the building.  Of these
witnesses I was particularly impressed
by Georgina Morgan, who, apart from her generally persuasive demeanour, had the
advantage
of having lived with the plaintiff and Mr Dormer from February 1986
to early June 1986, that is until just before the accident.
<P>

199  	I will deal with the extent to which I accept the evidence of
the  expert witnesses in later parts of this judgment.
<P>

<b>Liability</b>
<P>

200  	Counsel for the defendant did not dispute that on 30 June 1986
the plaintiff had fallen on the stairs leading from the car
park on the roof of
the building at Gladesville.  Mr Firth said in his evidence that the plaintiff
had told him some time in 1986
that she had had a fall on the stairs.  
<P>

201  	It was also not disputed by counsel for the defendant that the
defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff to take reasonable care
to provide a
safe means of access from the car park to the office where the plaintiff
worked.  Nor was it disputed that, if the plaintiff
could establish that the
stairs were slippery and that she had fallen because of the slipperiness of the
stairs, she was entitled
to a verdict.  It was conceded that, if the stairs
were slippery, there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to the
defendant's
employees including the plaintiff and there were reasonably
practical steps the defendant could have taken which would have obviated
the
risk, which the defendant had not taken.  
<P>

202  	I am prepared to accept the plaintiff's evidence that the shoe
which she produced to Professor Morton and which Professor
Morton tested and
which was later admitted as an exhibit, was one of the shoes she had been
wearing at the time of the accident.
 I am also prepared to accept the
plaintiff's evidence that she had not worn those shoes much after the accident.

<P>

203  	If these matters are accepted, then I consider that Professor
Morton's conclusions should be accepted.  Professor Morton was
not really
shaken in cross-examination (except at one stage when he fleetingly seemed to
suggest that a coefficient of friction could
depend on the pressure exerted on
a surface) and there was no competing expert for the defendant.  Professor
Morton concluded that
the surfaces of the treads of the stairs were very
smooth, were not provided with a non-slip finish throughout or with non-skid
strips
near the edge of the nosings and for common footwear, including shoes of
the type worn by the plaintiff, were sufficiently slippery
to be dangerous,
even when the stairs were clean and dry.
<P>

204  	I have reached the conclusion that the stairs were slippery,
without resort to the evidence about there having been loose
grit on the
stairs, which, in Professor Morton's opinion, would, had it been present, have
increased the slipperiness of the stairs.
 I would not accept the evidence of
either the plaintiff or Ms Blanch that they observed loose grit on the stairs.
However, it does
seem to me that, more probably than not, there would have
been, by reason of the nature of the walls of the stairway, some grit on
the
stairs, which would have increased their slipperiness, even though the degree
by which the slipperiness was increased cannot
be quantified.
<P>

205  	The remaining question on liability is whether the plaintiff
slipped because of the slipperiness of the tread of a step on
the stairs or
simply lost her footing.  In her evidence the plaintiff merely said that her
foot went out from underneath her.  I
find on the balance of probabilities that
the plaintiff fell because her foot slipped owing to the slippery surface of
the stairs.
 If a person is going down stairs and the stairs are slippery and
the person loses her footing, then it is likely that the slipperiness
of the
stairs contributed to her losing her footing.
<P>

206  	I find a verdict for the plaintiff.  There is, however, the
further question whether the damages to which the plaintiff is
entitled are
limited to damages for some soft tissue injuries which would have resolved
within a short time after the fall or extend
to damages for a serious and
continuing medical condition which the plaintiff sustained as a consequence of
the fall.  
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Medical Condition</b>
<P>

207  	I have already expressed the conclusion that the plaintiff was
not generally malingering and that I should accept most of
her evidence, while
discounting some of it to some extent as being exaggerated.  Without accepting
all of the plaintiff's evidence
about her symptoms and disabilities or the
level of them, I accept that since the fall the plaintiff has had, among other
symptoms,
generalised pain, increased sensitivity to pain, fatigue, sleep
disturbance, headaches, visual disturbance, muscle spasms, paraesthesia,
anxiety and depression and difficulty in remembering and concentrating.
<P>

208  	I accept the diagnosis of fibromyalgia made by Dr Wilson.  Dr
Wilson who has conducted research into fibromyalgia is well
qualified to give
evidence on the subject.
<P>

209  	The "impression" formed by Dr Podgorski, a rheumatologist in
August 1993, that is, before the plaintiff had seen Dr Wilson,
was that "it is
most likely she has a variant of fibromyalgia syndrome".  
<P>

210  	Dr Millons, an orthopaedic specialist relied on by the
defendant, was sceptical about fibromyalgia.  However, he had not made
any
study of fibromyalgia and his evidence was really to the effect that, as an
orthopaedic specialist, he could find no orthopaedic
basis for the plaintiff's
complaints of pain and is sceptical of complaints of pain if he can find no
physical basis for them.
<P>

211  	I have accepted that the plaintiff suffers from fibromyalgia.
However, I consider that some of the plaintiff's evidence about
her symptoms
and disabilities is exaggerated and I also consider that there is a quite
substantial frankly psychiatric component
in her condition.
<P>

212  	If the plaintiff is not suffering from fibromyalgia, then I
would hold that she has, as Dr Shand considered (if the history
was accepted
and I have found that the history should be largely accepted), "a significant
psychiatric disorder, being either somatization
disorder or undifferentiated
somatoform disorder".
<P>

213  	Whether the plaintiff's condition is fibromyalgia or the
psychiatric disorder diagnosed by Dr Shand, it is unlikely that it
will improve
to any great extent.
<P>

<b>Causation</b>
<P>

214  	I turn to the question of whether the plaintiff's condition was
legally caused by the fall on 30 June 1986, which was itself,
as I have found,
caused by the defendant's breach of duty.  
<P>

215  	I was referred by counsel for the plaintiff to a number of
authorities on causation.
<P>

216  	In <b>Medlin v State Government Insurance Commission</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d1995%29%20182%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-1995) 182 CLR 1</a> Deane J, Dawson J, Toohey J and Gaudron J said in their
joint judgment at pp6 and 7:-
<P>

"For the purposes of the law of negligence, the question whether the requisite
causal connexion exists between a particular breach
of duty and particular loss
or damage is essentially one of fact to be resolved, on the probabilities, as a
matter of commonsense
and experience.  And that remains so in a case such as
the present where the question of the existence of the requisite causal
connexion
is complicated by the intervention of some act or decision of the
plaintiff or a third party which constitutes a more immediate cause
of the loss
or damage.  In such a case, the `but for' text, while retaining an important
role as a negative criterion which will
commonly (but not always) exclude
causation if not satisfied, is inadequate as a comprehensive positive test.
If, in such a case,
it can be seen that the necessary causal connection would
exist if the intervening act or decision be disregarded, the question of
causation may often be conveniently expressed in terms of whether the intrusion
of that act or decision has had the effect of breaking
the chain of causation
which would otherwise have existed between the breach of duty and the
particular loss or damage.  The ultimate
question must, however, always be
whether, notwithstanding the intervention of the subsequent decision, the
defendant's wrongful
act or omission is, as between the plaintiff and the
defendant and as a matter of commonsense and experience, properly to be seen
as
having caused the relevant loss or damage.  Indeed, in some cases, it may be
potentially misleading to pose the question of causation
in terms of whether an
intervening act or decision has interrupted or broken a chain of causation
which would otherwise have existed.
 An example of such a case is where the
negligent act or omission was itself a direct or indirect contributing cause of
the intervening
act or decision.   It will be seen that, on the plaintiff's
evidence, the present was such a case.
<P>

Nor can the question of causation of damage in a negligence action be
automatically answered by classification of operative causes
as `pre-eminent'
or `subsidiary'.  Regardless of such classification, two or more distinct
causes, without any one of which the particular
damage would not have been
sustained, can each satisfy the law of negligence's commonsense test of
causation.  This can be most obviously
so in a case where a `subsidiary' cause
operates both directly as a cause of the particular damage and indirectly as a
contributing
component of a `pre-eminent' cause".
<P>

Windeyer J said in a passage which has often been referred to subsequently:-
<P>

"There is I think a critical distinction between a supervening happening that
prevents a particular damage occurring as a result
of the tort and a
supervening happening that causes the harm caused by the tort to have added
gravity.  In the first class of case
the supervening event diminishes the
damages which flow from the tort:  in the second class it merely adds to them,
so that the tortfeasor
responsible for the first accident remains liable for
the harm he caused, which is not merged in the combined result of his
wrongdoing
and the later event".
<P>

218  	I was also referred to the decision of the Full Court of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia in <b>State Government Insurance Commission
v Oakley</b> (1990) Aust.Tort Reports 81-003 in which Malcolm CJ said at
67,577:-
<P>

"In my opinion, where the negligence of a defendant causes an injury and the
plaintiff subsequently suffers a further injury the
position is as follows:-
<P>

(1) where the further injury results from a subsequent accident, which would
not have occurred had the plaintiff not been in the
physical condition caused
by the defendant's negligence, the added damage should be treated as caused by
that negligence;
<P>

(2) where the further injury results from a subsequent accident, which would
have occurred had the plaintiff been in normal health,
but the damage sustained
is greater because of aggravation of the earlier injury, the additional damage
resulting from the aggravated
injury should be treated as caused by the
defendant's negligence; and
<P>

(3) where the further injury results from a subsequent accident which would
have occurred had the plaintiff been in normal health
and the damage sustained
include no element of aggravation of the earlier injury, the subsequent
accident and further injury should
be regarded as causally independent of the
first.
<P>

Authority for the first two propositions may be found in Fishlock v Plummer

`increased vulnerability' cases: Lunz, Assessment of Damages for 
<P>

`...an accident arising from an independent cause which increases the damage
caused by the first accident but does not arise out
of it'.
<P>

In such a case the plaintiff does not recover the full damages resulting from
the second accident, but only those extra consequences
of the second injury due
to the existence of the first injury".
<P>

219  	In my opinion, I should hold that the plaintiff has established
a causal connection between the fall, and hence the breach
of duty by the
defendant, and her fibromyalgia or psychiatric disorder.
<P>

220  	This conclusion is supported by the evidence of Dr Wilson.  Dr
Wilson gave evidence that fibromyalgia can commence with, or
without, defined
physical or psychological stressors.  However, although fibromyalgia can occur
without any clear precipitant, it
can develop following physical trauma, such
as a fall.  It would be unusual for there to be a single cause of fibromyalgia.
I consider
that Dr Wilson should be taken as having accepted that it was likely
that in the present case a number of factors had contributed
to the plaintiff's
condition.  However, in Dr Wilson's opinion, the plaintiff's illness was
precipitated, or caused, by the fall
at work and he gave reasons for reaching
this opinion which I have already quoted or referred to.
<P>

221  	A reason relied on by counsel for the plaintiff, and Dr Wilson,
as establishing a causal link between the fall and the plaintiff's
condition
was that from 10 July 1986, that is from within a few days of the fall, the
plaintiff, who had previously sought medical
or paramedical attention only
rarely, sought paramedical attention frequently and unremittingly.  However,
counsel for the defendant
pointed out that the plaintiff did not seek attention
after 30 June 1986 until 10 July 1986 and that in the meantime she had been
injured in the incident which occurred on 10 July.  Counsel for the defendant
pointed out that there was no expert medical evidence
linking the likely
consequences of a fall such as the plaintiff had had on 30 June 1986 with an
inability to straighten up after
bending such as the plaintiff had experienced
on 10 July 1986.
<P>

222  	However, I accept the plaintiff's evidence that the incident on
10 July 1986 of itself was very minor;  the plaintiff was
unable to straighten
up after bending down to put paper in a printer.  I also accept the plaintiff's
evidence that the symptoms she
felt after the incident on 10 July 1986 were in
parts of her body where she had been feeling pain since the fall on 30 June.  I
accept
that the two incidents on 30 June and 10 July were linked, because of
their close proximity in time, the minor nature of the incident
on 10 July
standing by itself and because of the plaintiff's evidence, which I accept,
about the continuation of her symptoms between
30 June and 10 July and after 10
July.
<P>

223  	If the plaintiff had not already been injured on 30 June 1986,
the incident on 10 July 1986 of itself would probably not have
caused any
injury to her.  The incident on 10 July 1986 was a supervening happening that
caused the harm caused by the tort to have
added gravity (<b>Faulkner v
Keffalinos</b>).  All of the damage sustained on 10 July was additional damage
resulting from the aggravation of the earlier injury, thus falling
within the
second class described by Malcolm CJ in <b>Oakley</b>.
<P>

224  	A finding of a causal connection between the fall, and hence
the defendant's breach of duty, and the plaintiff's condition
is strongly
supported, as Dr Wilson observed, by the circumstance that the plaintiff was in
good health before 30 June 1986 and after
30 June 1986 was in bad health.  Such
a finding is supported by the plaintiff's evidence, my finding that the
incident on 10 July
1986 was of itself minor, the evidence of the plaintiff not
seeking treatment before 30 June 1986 but seeking treatment continually
and at
considerable cost after 30 June 1986 and by the evidence of the plaintiff's
women friends and especially Georgina Morgan who
lived with the plaintiff for
some months shortly before the accident.
<P>

225  	I have taken into account the evidence about Mr Dormer pushing
down on the plaintiff's head but I have concluded that this
incident would
probably have been a less traumatic experience for the plaintiff than losing
her footing and falling down six stairs
out of control, striking a landing with
part of her body and hitting her head on the railing.
<P>

226  	In the present case it was accepted by counsel for the
plaintiff, and I would find, that there have probably been a number
of factors
contributing to the plaintiff's present condition.  These factors could include
the plaintiff's glandular fever in 1989,
the termination of her pregnancy in
1990, the end of the relationship with her de facto husband which had lasted
ten years, the sexual
harassment to which she was subjected in 1992 and the
loss of her job and career with Makita.
<P>

227  	That there have been other causal factors for which the
defendant is not responsible which have contributed to the gravity
of the
plaintiff's condition does not excuse the defendant from liability for her
condition.  
<P>

228  	In any event, a number of these other factors did not occur,
until after the plaintiff had complained of her symptoms and
had given a
history relating to the fall.  In 1989 the plaintiff had given Anne Petrie a
history that the onset of symptoms had occurred
after falling at work on 30
June 1986.  This was before the termination of the plaintiff's pregnancy and
before the ending of the
relationship with her de facto husband.  The plaintiff
made a formal claim for compensation in late 1991, before Mr Weekes commenced
to be employed by Makita and hence before the sexual harassment started.
<P>

229  	Supervening events such as the termination of the plaintiff's
pregnancy, the ending of her relationship with Mr Dormer, the
sexual harassment
and the loss of her job and career with Makita were happenings that caused the
harm caused by the tort to have
added gravity, that is were happenings falling
within the second class in the distinction drawn by Windeyer J in <b>Faulkner v
Keffalinos</b> and within the second class of case described by Malcolm CJ in
<b>Oakley</b>.  If it is necessary so to find, I would find that all of these
happenings were reasonably foreseeable.  If the plaintiff had not
already been
vulnerable by reason of her fibromyalgia or psychiatric condition, then it is
likely that she would have been able to
cope with the sexual harassment by Mr
Weekes.  As it was, the stress from the sexual harassment made her condition
worse.  
<P>

230  	I consider that my conclusion on causation derive some support
from the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in
<b>Nader v Urban
Transit Authority of New South Wales</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 501.</a>  The accident on
30 June 1986 was a legal cause of the plaintiff's condition because it
materially contributed in fact to the onset
and continuation of the
condition.
<P>

<b>Heads of Damages</b>
<P>

231  	Counsel for the plaintiff prepared a schedule of heads of
damages claimed, including the amount claimed under each head. 
The heads of
damages claimed were:-
<P>

1.	General Damages
<P>

2.	Interest on Past General Damages
<P>

3.	Past Economic Loss
<P>

4.	Interest on Past Economic Loss
<P>

5.	Future Economic Loss
<P>

6.	Loss of Superannuation
<P>

7.	Loss of Long Service Leave
<P>

8.	Past Domestic Assistance
<P>

9.	Interest on Past Domestic Assistance
<P>

10.	Future Domestic Assistance
<P>

11.	Past Medical Treatment and Expenses
<P>

12.	Future Medical Treatment and Expenses.
<P>

232  	The claims for items 3 to 7 were supported by two reports of
Furzer Crestani Services dated 31 August 1998 and 29 November
1999.  The claims
for items 8 to 11 were supported by a report from Dial-an-Angel of 18 August
1998 and two reports by Deborah Hammond,
occupational therapist.
<P>

233  	At the hearing there was very little discussion of the schedule
prepared by counsel for the plaintiff.  Indeed, the schedule
was not the
subject of any direct submissions, oral or written, by counsel for the
defendant.  In the circumstances, I do not consider
that I should attempt to
deal fully with all of the claims in this judgment.  I will make certain
findings, which may be sufficient
to resolve any real issues between the
parties.  If not, there will have to be further argument and I will have to
give a further
judgment.
<P>

<b>Item 1 - General Damages</b>
<P>

234  	The range of damages suggested by counsel for the plaintiff was
$80,000 to $120,000.  I consider that, in the light of the
findings I have made
elsewhere in this judgment, a figure at the bottom of that range is
appropriate.  I award $80,000.
<P>

<b>Item 2 - Interest on Past General Damages</b>
<P>

235  	I accept the submission by counsel for the plaintiff that, for
the purpose of the calculation of interest on past general
damages, half of the
general damages should be allocated to the past.
<P>

<b>Items 3-7</b>
<P>

These items are related.
<P>

236  	The calculations by Furzer Crestani of the amount of damages
which should be awarded for past economic loss and the amount
of damages which
should be awarded for future economic loss (adopting in their second report the
date 30 November 1999 as being the
date of the hearing and hence marking the
division between past and future loss) depended on a number of assumptions
including:-
<P>

(i)	If the plaintiff had not ceased to be employed by Makita, her income would
have increased to $44,000 a year, as from 1 April
1993.
<P>

(ii)	As from 1 July 1995 the plaintiff would have become the electronic data
processing manager of Makita, on the retirement of
Mr Firth.  Alternatively, if
the plaintiff had not been appointed electronic data processing manager of
Makita, she would have obtained
alternative employment elsewhere at an
equivalent salary.
<P>

(iii)	The plaintiff would have continued working until she attained the age of
sixty-five.
<P>

(iv)	As a result of the accident the plaintiff has no residual earning
capacity.
<P>

237  	Furzer Crestani prepared two scenarios for future loss of
earning capacity, namely scenario 1 which was based on the plaintiff
continuing
as electronic data processing manager of Makita at a gross annual wage of
$59,190 and scenario 2 based on the plaintiff
obtaining employment as a
computer programmer or an electronic data processing manager at a gross annual
wage of $70,000.
<P>

238  	In the absence of any challenge by the defendant, I would
accept assumptions (i) and (iii).  The plaintiff gave evidence,
which was not
challenged, that she intended working until she was sixty-five.
<P>

239  	Assumption (ii) is more controversial.  Mr Firth gave evidence
that, in his opinion, while the plaintiff was capable of doing
Mr Firth's job
(technically), she was not capable of handling people.  However, I consider
that assumption (ii) should be accepted.
 Mr Firth agreed that the plaintiff
had been a good worker and a competent supervisor.  She was already second in
charge of the electronic
data processing division.  Alternatively, I consider
it likely that, if the plaintiff had been passed over for the position of
electronic
data processing manager on Mr Firth's retirement, she would have
obtained employment elsewhere at an equivalent income.
<P>

240  	Assumption (iv) made by Furzer Crestani was that the plaintiff
had no residual earning capacity.  This assumption is supported
by evidence
from the plaintiff and evidence from Dr Wilson.  However, I do not consider
that the plaintiff should be regarded as
having no residual earning capacity at
all.  She has skills and experience as a computer operator and a programmer.  I
consider that
in her evidence she exaggerated some of her alleged disabilities
which would impinge on her capacity to work, including her alleged
difficulty
in using her right hand and arm and her alleged inability to sit for long
without experiencing discomfort.  In expressing
his opinion about the
plaintiff's capacity to work Dr Wilson accepted the plaintiff's complaints
about her symptoms and disabilities.
 I consider that there is a real chance of
the plaintiff obtaining some employment, even if only part-time or to be
performed at
her home.
<P>

241  	It is difficult to assess what allowance should be made for the
plaintiff's residual earning capacity.  In my opinion, the
discount for
contingencies in assessing damages for future loss of earning capacity should
be increased from the conventional 15
percent to 331/3 per cent to allow for
the plaintiff having some residual earning capacity.
<P>

242  	Of the two scenarios in Furzer Crestani's report, scenario 1
should be adopted.  The plaintiff's evidence was that she wanted
to obtain Mr
Firth's position.
<P>

243  	The claims for loss of superannuation and loss of long service
leave may have to be modified to take into account my findings
about the
plaintiff's residual earning capacity.
<P>

<b>Items 8, 9 10 and 11</b>
<P>

These items are related
<P>

244  	I have noted earlier that damages to be awarded for past
assistance and for future assistance and interest on the value of
past
assistance are not subject to the restrictions under s151K and s151M of the
<i>Workers Compensation Act</i>.  
<P>

245  	I accept that since she returned to live at her mother's home
in October 1993 the plaintiff has reasonably required assistance
and that she
will reasonably require assistance for the rest of her life.
<P>

246  	Various estimates were given in the evidence about the number
of hours of assistance which have been required and which will
be required by
the plaintiff.  Estimates were given by the plaintiff, the plaintiff's mother
and Dr Wilson and estimates were given
in the reports by Dial-an-Angel and
Deborah Hammond.  The report by Carroll and Ranson is simply a calculation of
the cost of assistance,
based on assumptions furnished by others.
<P>

247  	I reject as exaggerated an estimate given by the plaintiff that
her mother has spent four hours a day looking after her, ever
since October
1993.  
<P>

248  	On the basis of information supplied by the plaintiff's mother,
Deborah Hammond estimated that the additional workload performed
by Mrs
Sprowles to care for the plaintiff has been three hours per week.
<P>

249  	Dr Wilson estimated that in order to assist the plaintiff carry
out basic activities of daily living in the absence of her
mother, care would
be required at the rate of approximately two hours per day indefinitely.  
<P>

250  	Dial-an-Angel made certain estimates of the number of hours of
assistance required.  These estimates were based on the general
experience of
Dial-an-Angel and on a full acceptance of information to the effect that the
plaintiff was unable to perform domestic,
gardening and handyman tasks and was
unable to manage the basic activities of daily living.  I consider that this
information overstates
the true position.  
<P>

251  	I consider that I should give weight to the opinions of Deborah
Hammond, who visited the plaintiff at her mother's home and
who completed an
occupational therapy assessment of the plaintiff.  Ms Hammond considered that
the plaintiff would be able to resume
doing most of her shopping.  It would
also appear from Ms Hammond's reports that she considered that the plaintiff,
by purchasing
and using certain household appliances and by modifying her work
methods, would be able to resume meal preparation.  Ms Hammond envisaged
that
the plaintiff would be able to resume light home care tasks.
<P>

252  	I would like to hear further submissions relating to these
heads of damages before I determine what amount of damages should
be
awarded.
<P>

<b>Item 11</b>
<P>

253  	A claim for $19,277.06 was arithmetically agreed as being the
amount of past medical treatment and expenses and I would allow
this amount.
<P>

<b>Item 12</b>
<P>

254  	I would allow the claims for the future cost of an osteopath
(one consultation per week), the future cost of medical consultations
and for
the amounts supported by Deborah Hammond's report.  The claim for travelling
expenses was not pressed.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

255  	I have found a verdict for the plaintiff.  If the parties are
unable to agree in respect of any head of damages what amount
should, in
accordance with this judgment, be awarded, the matter will have to be relisted
before me by arrangement through my associate.
