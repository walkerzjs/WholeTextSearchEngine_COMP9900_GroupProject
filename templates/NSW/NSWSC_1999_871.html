<b>2513/98	STEPHEN TURNBULL v DOBRA GORGIEVSKI &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b> (as to admissibility of par 8 of First Defendant's affidavit
sworn 26 June 1998)
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1   	These are proceedings brought by a plaintiff under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 37A</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> to set aside the transfer by the first defendant to
the second defendant of his half share in a property.  The transfer was at a
nominal consideration and occurred whilst proceedings were being prosecuted in
the District Court by the present plaintiff against
the first defendant for
damages for assault which subsequently resulted in the entry of judgment for
the plaintiff for some $180,000.
 Par 8 in the affidavit of Dobra Gorgievski
sworn 26 June 1998 is objected to.  The paragraph is as follows:
<P>

"I am aware of the arrangements my parents made in respect of the purchase
because my father said to me:  'We've got the money from
the sale of the house
in Newtown and some money in the account but we've got to borrow some money'.
Or words to that effect.  'We
need to borrow $35,000 to buy the house and pay
the expenses.  Your mum is not working and the bank won't lend me the $35,000.
If
you put your name on the loan, the bank will lend me the $35,000' or words
to that effect.
<P>

He said further:  'Just put your name on it and don't worry about the money.
I'll be repaying it' or words to that effect.  He said:
 'Just as long as they
give us the $35,000, don't worry, I'll repay it'."
<P>

The context in which the question arises is as follows.  Part of the
defendants' case is that the reason for the nominal consideration
was that the
first defendant had only a nominal interest in the property, the beneficial
interest having been at all times in the
second defendant who was the
transferee.  The conversations tendered go to this issue and relate to the
circumstances in which the
title to the property was put in the first
defendant's name in the first place.  
<P>

2   	The statements by which the first defendant recounts what
his father said to him at the time are obviously hearsay within the
meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 59</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>") and therefore, prima facie,
inadmissible.  They are tendered under the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63(2)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
The father is unavailable to give evidence about the asserted fact because he
is dead.  The evidence is given by the son, who participated
in the
conversation and therefore heard the representations being made.  Because of
the father's unavailability to give evidence,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> requires that
reasonable notice in writing should have been given to the plaintiff of the
defendants' intention to adduce the evidence.
 That notice should state "the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> on which the defendants intend to  rely" and further
requirements of the notice are stipulated in regulation 5 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_reg/er189/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Regulations</a> as follows:
<P>

"5(1)	This regulation is made for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

(2)	A notice of previous representation must state:
<P>

(a)	...... the substance of evidence of a previous representation that the
notifying party intends to adduce; and
<P>

(b)	the substance of all other relevant representations made by the person who
made that previous representation, so far as they
are known to the notifying
party; and
<P>

(c) 	particulars of:
<P>

(i)	the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which each of the
representations mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) was made;
and
<P>

(ii)	the names and addresses of the persons by whom, and the persons to whom,
each of those representations was made; so far as
they are known to the
notifying party.
<P>

(3)	If a notifying party intends to rely on any of paragraphs [sic] 63(2)(a) or
(b) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, the party's notice of previous representation must state
particulars of the facts on the basis of which it is alleged that the person
who made a representation referred to in the notice is not available to testify
concerning the fact to be proved by adducing evidence
of that
representation.
<P>

(4)	If a notifying party intends to rely on paragraph 64(2)(a) or (b) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, the party's notice of previous representation must state particulars of
the facts that the party will rely on to establish the grounds
specified in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 64(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>."
<P>

The defendants did not give any notice in a separate document.  They contend
that the early service of an affidavit containing par
8 is itself a sufficient
written notice for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67.</a>  I do not think this is so.  It may be
that, in some cases, if all the relevant factual information were comprised in
the affidavit
containing the statement of the evidence, it would be arguable
that the affidavit amounts to a notice, although I have reservations
even about
this.  I do not need to reach a conclusion on that proposition, because here it
is clear that some of the relevant factual
material does not appear from the
affidavit.  For example, whilst the time of the conversation may be inferred
from the contents
of the affidavit (ie, between the sale of one property and
the purchase of another), the place is simply not specified at all.  In
those
circumstances, it is clear that there is no sufficient notice.
<P>

3   	Miss Winfield, of counsel for the defendants, alternatively
seeks a direction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63(2)</a> apply to this evidence,
despite the absence of notice.  Certainly in this case there is a strong case
for the grant of leave since,
despite the absence of a formal notice within the
meaning of the section, actual notice was given of most of the matters
required.
 The terms of the conversation were set out in the affidavit.  The
time, as I have said, appears from the terms of the affidavit.
 It was common
knowledge between  the parties that the father was dead.  The place of the
conversation is not stated, but has been
stated by Miss Winfield in Court this
morning as the home at Newtown, which is hardly surprising in the context of
the evidence in
this case.  Mr Sibtain, of counsel for the plaintiff, says that
leave should not be granted.  He says that my relevant discretion
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
should be exercised, bearing in mind the severe limitations the common law
placed upon the admission of the evidence of deceased
persons and the reasons
behind that policy of the common law, particularly the virtual impossibility of
investigation of or challenge
to statements made by deceased persons.  However,
in my opinion this submission is misguided.  The policy of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.2</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
is to reform the law of hearsay evidence by substantially adding to the
exceptions and by quite specifically widening the circumstances
in which
statements of deceased persons may be placed in evidence as hearsay.  I do not
think that the matters referred to by Mr
Sibtain should impede me in exercising
the discretion to grant leave, because, despite the absence of formal notice,
the plaintiff
was substantially on notice of the relevant matters.  In my
opinion it is appropriate to grant leave in the circumstances.
<P>

4   	Mr Sibtain has not, in opposing the admission of the
evidence, adverted to the discretion to reject evidence conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  However, I indicate I should not be inclined, in any event, to reject
the evidence through the mechanism of that section.
<P>

5   	The requisite direction necessitated by the lack of notice
will be made and par 8 of the affidavit will be admitted.  In saying
that, it
will not be forgotten, when the evidence comes to be weighed, that it is the
uncorroborated statement by an interested party
as to what was said to him by a
parent who is now dead and unavailable to be cross-examined or to give evidence
in any form concerning
the matter allegedly asserted by him.
<P>

<center>...oOo...</center>
<P>


<P>

6   	Mr Sibtain has subsequently made an application to me, not
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> but under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 136</a>, to limit the use to be made of certain
of the evidence when admitted.  The portion of par 8 in relation to which he
presses this
application is:
<P>

"'Your mum is not working and the bank won't lend me the $35,000.  If you put
your name on the loan, the bank will lend me the $35,000'
or words to that
effect."
<P>

In response to this application Miss Winfield of counsel for the plaintiffs
does not oppose a limitation being made so that that
evidence may not be used
to prove the truth of the assertions but only the fact that those assertions
were made by father to son.
 In view of that concession, I limit the use of
that passage in par 8 in that way.
<P>
