<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	This dispute arises as a matter of extreme urgency, in the
context of a contested takeover for an oil resources company. The
Plaintiff,
Cultus Petroleum NL, ("Cultus") is the target company and the Defendant, OMV
Australia Pty Ltd, ("OMVA") is the cash bidder.
Cultus seeks an injunction on a
final basis restraining the Defendant from despatching to the shareholders of
Cultus the takeover
offer contained in OMVA's Part A Statement. Cultus seeks
declarations that the Part A Statement does not comply with the requirements
of
cl 17 of s750 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, in failing to set out certain
information said to be material to the making of a decision by an offeree
whether or not to accept
the takeover offer. Cultus also seeks a declaration
that OMVA is in possession of confidential information of Cultus and seeks an
order restraining OMVA from disclosing the information, being the self-same
information that it contends should have been disclosed
in the Part A
Statement. OMVA denies any breach of cl 17, denies it is constrained by
confidentiality were disclosure required and
contends that injunctive relief
should in any event be denied on discretionary grounds. It cross-claims for a
dispensing order pursuant
to s743 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, to the extent
the Part A Statement has contravened s750 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

2   	Because issues of confidentiality arise, I have necessarily
written this judgment in a way which avoids unnecessary disclosure
of material
as yet arguably confidential.
<P>

<b>CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</b>
<P>

3   	The Plaintiff puts its case in the alternative as
follows:
<P>

(a)	The information is material and therefore ought to be disclosed but is
confidential and therefore ought not to be disclosed:
in the circumstances, the
offer cannot proceed until the information ceases to be confidential or
material;
<P>

(b)	Alternatively to (a), if the court is of the view that the conflict is to
be overridden by giving clause 17 paramountcy over
the private duty of
confidentiality, the Part A Statement should not be sent out until amended;
<P>

(c)	Alternatively to (a) and (b), if the information is not regarded as being
subject to a duty of confidentiality, it should be
disclosed in Part A.
<P>

4   	Finally, the Plaintiff seeks a declaration that an
agreement made 14 April 1999 between the Defendant and Portfolio Partners
Limited (quoted at para 8 below) is in breach of s697 of the <i>Corporations
Law</i> and thus void. This is on the basis that the agreement, said to be an
option, gave rise to a "relevant interest" within the meaning
of s9 of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> when the agreement was entered into and the Defendant
thus "acquired" those shares within the meaning of s51(1)(a) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>. It is then contended that, pursuant to the terms of
that agreement, the Defendant derived a prohibited benefit, namely the right
to
be paid an additional amount calculated by reference to the takeover price.
That argument proceeds on the basis that the initial
$10 paid OMVA to acquire
the "option" -- in this case to buy 7.5 per cent of the shares in Cultus --
involves a benefit by way of
escalation of that amount to the amount paid under
the takeover offer.
<P>

5   	The Defendant's response to the injunction proceedings is
first to deny that the relevant materials require disclosure at all,
on the
basis that the information is not material but rather speculative. It further
contends that if it be found that any of the
information is material, then as
OMVA must then disclose it by compulsion of law, that disclosure will not
involve any liability
for breach of confidence. This relies on the
circumstances in which the information was acquired and the exceptions to any
restraint
upon its use. The Defendant advances discretionary considerations on
the balance of convenience favouring allowing the offer to proceed,
on the
basis that the offer is a cash offer, by an offeror obviously capable of
satisfying it and readily capable of assessment by
shareholders. Further, that
the offer was very significantly above the market price when it was announced
and it is now underpinning
the value of the shares, such that if it were not to
proceed this may cause very significant hardship and loss for shareholders.
Finally, it contends that such contraventions, if any, as may be found are of
such minor materiality in the context of such an offer
that they ought not to
prevent it proceeding.
<P>

6   	Finally, OMVA contends that Cultus has disentitled itself
to interlocutory relief, by delay. I quote from its written submissions:
<P>

"11.1	Although Cultus was served with the Part A on Monday 19 April, and was
agitating the matter in the press and rejecting the
bid in the ASX by Wednesday
21 April, it left it until Wednesday 28 April to raise any issue in
correspondence, and to the afternoon
of Friday 30 April to approach the court
for leave to file its summons, and comes before the Court seeking relief for
the first time
on Monday 3 May, the last day before the Part A and Offer is due
to be dispatched to shareholders.
<P>

11.2	Such delay places an offeror such as OMVA, and the Court, in an impossible
position. In this type of matter, a target company
who wishes to restrain
dispatch of a Part A must act very promptly, and not leave it until the last
moment before the Part A is to
be dispatched."
<P>

7   	I should note that the factual matters stated in 11.1 above
were not disputed.
<P>

<b>Section 697 -- prohibited escalator agreement?</b>
<P>

8   	I quote below (omitting formal parts) the relevant
agreement followed by the relevant parts of s697 of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>:
<P>

"In consideration for $10 (which has been received), we agree with OMV
Australia Pty Limited (OMV) that we will accept a takeover
offer by OMV in
relation to Cultus Petroleum NL (Cultus), and/or will cause parties holding
shares in Cultus on our behalf or on
our instruction to accept such an offer in
respect of 15363 million Cultus shares (referred to as our Cultus Shares) on
the terms
set out in this letter.
<P>

We further acknowledge and agree that OMV may only require us to accept its
takeover offers:
<P>

a)	If OMV announces, within 5 business days after the date of this letter, that
it will make takeover offers for al of the shares
in Cultus;
<P>

b)	If OMV dispatches, within two months after the date of this letter, takeover
offers for Cultus under the Corporations Law;
<P>

c)	If the takeover offers are or become unconditional;
<P>

d)	Only if we have not, in relation to our Cultus Shares, already accepted
OMV's takeover offer; and
<P>

e)	Before the date which is six months from the date of this agreement.
<P>

This agreement will terminate and our obligations hereunder will be released if
another takeover bid for all the shares in Cultus
is open for acceptance at a
higher price or value and OMV does not increase its bid price to at least match
that higher price or
value before the date which is 3 business days before the
close of the other bid. For the purposes of this paragraph, the value of
securities which are offered under a takeover bid as consideration will be 98%
of the weighted average sale price for those securities
on the Australian Stock
Exchange over the 5 trading days prior to OMV's takeover bid becoming
unconditional. In the event this methodology
cannot be applied, the value will
be 98% of that assessed by an independent merchant bank (acting as expert) as
at the date on which
OMV's takeover offers become unconditional.
<P>

Subject to satisfying the conditions above OMV may require us, by giving us a
notice in writing (at any time prior to 5 business
days before the end of the
period the offers by OMV remain open for acceptance), to accept or cause
acceptance of its takeover offer
in respect of all our Cultus Shares. We must
deliver a duly completed acceptance form for all our Cultus Shares to OMV by
10.00 am
on the day 3 business days after receipt of this notice and must do
anything else required of us to accept OMV's takeover offer in
accordance with
the SCH Business Rules.
<P>

We acknowledge that OMV's takeover offer may be made on the basis that (subject
to Division 4 of Part 6.3 of the Corporations Law)
it may only be accepted in
respect of all the shares held by a member of Cultus at the date of the Offer.
We agree to ensure that
our Cultus Shares are held by such persons and in such
manner as will enable us to comply with the terms of OMV's takeover offer
and
this agreement."
<P>

9   	Section 697 of the <i>Corporations Law</i> provides:
<P>

"<b>697</b>(1)	Where:
<P>

(a)	a person acquires shares in a class of shares in a company;
<P>

<P>

(d)	the giving or receiving of the benefit, the offer to give the benefit, or

<P>

(e)	the amount or value of the benefit was, or is to be, determined by
reference to, or by reference to matters including:
<P>

(i)	if subparagraph (b)(i) applies -- the amount or value of the consideration
that, under an offer made under the takeover scheme
(including such an offer as
varied, deemed to be varied or proposed to be varied), is to be paid or
provided for the acquisition

<P>

(2)	Where:

<P>

(i)	proposes to send takeover offers under a takeover scheme; or
<P>

(ii)	proposes to cause a takeover announcement to be made;
<P>

in respect of shares in that class;
<P>

(c)	at the time referred to in paragraph (b), a person (in this subsection
called the "relevant person"), being the offeror or an
associate of the
offeror:
<P>

a person who had, immediately before the acquisition referred to in paragraph

as mentioned in that
paragraph, or an associate of a person who so had such a relevant interest.;
<P>

(d)	the giving or receiving of the benefit, the offer to give the benefit or

case may be, is
attributable to, or is attributable to matters including, the acquisition
referred to in paragraph (a); and
<P>

(e)	the amount or value of the benefit was, or is to be, determined by
reference to, or by reference to matters including:
<P>

(i)	if subparagraph (b)(i) applies -- the amount or value of the consideration
that, under an offer proposed to be made under the
takeover scheme, is to be
paid or provided for the acquisition of the shares to which the offer
relates;
<P>

(ii)	......
<P>

(iii)	......
<P>

<P>

(3)	An agreement is void to the extent that it purports to provide for:
<P>

(a)	a person to give, offer to give, or agree to give, a benefit to a person;
or
<P>

(b)	a person to receive, or agree to receive, a benefit from a person;
<P>

in contravention of subsection (1) or (2)."
<P>

10   	So far as the s697 attack is concerned, OMVA answer it by
pointing out the following:
<P>

(i)	The relevant agreement is not in fact an option agreement though that of
itself is not material.
<P>

(ii)	The "acquisition" of a "relevant interest" which occurred on 14 April 1999
involved only the benefit of the option fee of $10
which was not "determined by
reference to ...... the amount or value of the consideration" to be paid under
the relevant takeover
offers, as required by s697(2)(e).
<P>

(iii)	The ability of Portfolio Partners to terminate its pre-acceptance upon
the making of a higher bid does not constitute a benefit
of the kind prohibited
by s697; <i>Savage Resources Ltd v Pasminco Investments Pty Ltd</i> (1998) 159
ALR 304, 317-321; see also <i>Primac Holdings Ltd v IAMA Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2022%20ACSR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 22 ACSR
454</a>; <i>Boral Energy Resources Ltd v TU Australia (Queensland) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
28 ACSR 1.</a>
<P>

(iv)	The benefit prohibited by s697 is not the benefit offered under the
takeover bid itself, but any benefit additional to those
offered under the
takeover -- for example, in the case of an escalator clause, where the earlier
seller is guaranteed to receive
the same price as is offered in a later
takeover, the benefit of receiving the sale price early; <i>RACV Investment Co
Pty Ltd v Silbury Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2013%20ACLR%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 13 ACLR 555.</a> But see now <i>Sagasco
Amadeus Pty Ltd v Magellan Petroleum Australia Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 508</a>, 518;
10 ACSR 398, in which the High Court held that mere earlier payment did not
constitute a relevant benefit under s698. See also
<i>Aberfoyle Ltd v Western
Metals Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20187" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 ACSR 187</a>, 215-216. That does not apply here, because
there is no early receipt of the sale price.
<P>

(v)	In any event, the amount to be received by Portfolio Partners under the
takeover bid is not attributable to the relevant acquisition
(by OMVA) on 14
April, but to Portfolio Partner's acceptance, in its capacity as a shareholder
(and not as vendor under the 14 April
agreement), of the takeover offer itself.
Accordingly, the benefits to be received under the takeover offers are not
prohibited benefits;
<i>Savage Resources Ltd v Pasminco Investments Pty Ltd</i>
(supra) at 321.
<P>

(vi)	While s697 may also apply to a benefit received by the <i>offeror</i>,
such as preventing a rival offeror from being able to purchase the shares after
the takeover commences (see <i>Primac Holdings Ltd v ASC</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLC
218)</a>, that is not the case here. This is because the terms of the agreement are
such that Portfolio Partners is not prevented from dealing
with a higher
bidder. Further, such benefit bears no relationship to the consideration
payable under the takeover bid, so that sub-para
(d) could not be satisfied.
<P>

<center>___________</center>
<P>

Thus the Defendant contends that neither sub-paragraphs (c), (d) or (e) of s697
are satisfied.
<P>

11   	Finally, the Defendant contends that even if the Portfolio
Partners' agreement were in contravention of s697, it would be
void only to the
extent that it purports to provide a prohibited benefit. That would not affect
the substantial accuracy of the statement
in the Part A to the effect that OMVA
was "entitled" to the shares the subject of that agreement, since an associate
relationship
would subsist between them such that the shares owned by Portfolio
Partners would be part of the "entitlement" of OMVA, notwithstanding
that the
agreement to acquire the shares was on this hypothesis void.
<P>

12   	It is convenient that I deal with the s697 point now. It
occupied substantially less time and, it is fair to say, was subsidiary
to the
Plaintiff's main attack based on non-disclosure and confidentiality, the two
horns upon which the Plaintiff sought to impale
the Defendant. 
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

13   	For the reasons earlier stated, I am satisfied that no
contravention of s697 occurred, and, it necessarily follows, there
was no
failure to disclose in the Part A nor any misstatement in relation to the
acquisition of the 7.5 per cent shareholding of
Portfolio Partners under the
terms of the relevant agreement. That agreement amounts to a conditional
agreement to accept the takeover
offer when made. The benefits Portfolio
Partners derive from that agreement are essentially those derived from
accepting the takeover
offer and are conferred by that offer; they are not
calculated by reference to it. The ability of Portfolio Partners to terminate
its pre-acceptance upon the making of a higher bid does not constitute a
benefit of the kind prohibited by s697. Though in relation
to s698 of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, the observations of Hely J in <i>Savage Resources Ltd
v Pasminco Investments Pty Ltd</i> at 319-320 are apposite:
<P>

"In commercial terms, the sale agreements reflect an expectation that Pasminco
will, in consequence of their execution, bid for
all Savage shares, but that
the selling shareholders are not to be disadvantaged in relation to the
Pasminco bid or its sequelae
by reason of having entered into these agreements.
They are to have the same opportunities as all offerees have of selling into
the
Pasminco bid, or accepting another offer (provided, in the case of the
selling shareholders, that it is a higher unmatched offer)
unless they have
already accepted the Pasminco bid. That may produce a difference in outcome
between a selling shareholder (who has
not sold into the bid) and a shareholder
(who has accepted the bid) in the event that a higher unmatched offer emerges.
But that
difference in outcome is not the result of inequality of opportunity;
it arises simply because one shareholder has accepted the bid,
and the other
has not.
<P>

Viewed in that way, the termination events in cl 4 of the sale agreements  are
not s698 "benefits". Their purpose and their effect
is to ensure that the
selling shareholders are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis the general body of
shareholders by reason of their having
entered into the sale agreements which
provided the catalyst for the bid. In the modern argot, a level playing field
is preserved."
<P>

14   	Put another way, such a "benefit" is not conferred upon
Portfolio Partners but is simply retained, and its nature is inherently
speculative depending as it does upon whether or not a competing higher bid
does emerge.
<P>

15   	I turn now to the factual background, starting with a
Statement of Agreed Facts. 
<P>

Gulf Australia (Cartier) Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Gulf Australia Resources
Limited (Gulf), operates the oil producing facility
at the oil fields on behalf
of all Jabiru Challis Joint Venture participants.
<P>

18   	The Jabiru Challis Joint Venture is governed by a Joint
Venture Agreement between the participants. It contains certain confidentiality
provisions, in particular, clause 14.01(b), which reads, relevantly:
<P>

" ... all data and information acquired or received by any Party under this
Agreement shall be held confidential during the continuance
of this Agreement
and for a period of five (5) years thereafter and shall not be divulged in any
way to any third party, without
the prior written approval of all the Parties
which shall not be unreasonably withheld provided that:-
<P>

(i)	any Party may, without such approval, disclose such data and
information:
<P>

(aa)	to any Affiliate or bona fide intended assignee of such Party upon
obtaining a similar undertaking of confidentiality from
such Affiliate or
assignee in favour of all the Parties;
<P>

(bb)	to any outside consultants, upon obtaining a similar undertaking of
confidentiality from such consultants in favour of all
the Parties provided
that such Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of the name of such
consultants and the data and information
disclosed to them;
<P>

...
<P>

(dd)	to the extent required by the Act, the Permit, any other applicable laws
or regulations or the Securities and Exchange Commission
of the United States
of America or any other Security Commission having jurisdiction over a Party or
the regulations of any recognised
stock exchange on which are listed for
quotation shares in the capital of such Party or any Affiliate of such Party
<P>

... "
<P>

19   	On pages 10-11 of the Plaintiff's 1998 Annual Report (sent
to shareholders of the Plaintiff in October 1998) the following
statement is
made:
<P>

"In June 1998, Gulf Australia Resources Limited (Gulf) announced the purchase
of BHPP's Timor Sea production assets.  The sale installs
Gulf as the new
operator from January, 1999 and it is believed that this change will bring a
renewed focus to maximising value of
the assets through reduction of operating
expense, increasing field life and production asset utilisation, and through
further exploration".
<P>

20   	Gulf Canada Resources Limited is in the process of
offering its interest in Gulf Australia Resources Limited for sale.  For
that
purpose it caused an Information Memorandum to be prepared. Gulf Canada
required prospective purchasers to enter a confidentiality
agreement before
providing them with the Information Memorandum.
<P>

21   	On 22 February 1999, HSBC Securities Australia Limited (on
behalf of Gulf Canada) invited OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV) to
investigate
Gulf, for the purposes of considering whether OMV may be interested in
acquiring Gulf.
<P>

22   	On 30 March 1999, OMV executed a Confidentiality Agreement
with Gulf Canada. The agreement restricts OMV's use and disclosure
of certain
confidential information acquired by it in the sale process. 
<P>

23   	Under clause 5(d) of the Confidentiality Agreement,
disclosure of confidential information is permitted where that information
is:
<P>

"required to be disclosed under applicable law or by a governmental decree,
order, regulation or rule or by any legal process, whether
or not the
requirement arises independently or as a result of any action taken by the
Receiving Party before or after the date of
this Agreement."
<P>

24   	Clause 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement provides, in
part, as follows:
<P>

"The Disclosing Party warrants and represents that it has the right and
authority to disclose its Confidential Information to the
Receiving Party."
<P>

25   	On 31 March 1999 a technical committee meeting of the
Jabiru Challis Joint Venture parties was convened in Gulf's Perth offices.
<P>

26   	At some time between 2 and 5 April 1999, OMV received from
HSBC Securities Australia Limited (on behalf of Gulf Canada) an
Information
Memorandum prepared for the purposes of the proposed sale of Gulf Australia.

<P>

27   	On or about 8 April 1999, directors of the Defendant
considered the Information Memorandum and its content for the purpose
of
assessing whether or not any information contained in it should be disclosed in
a Part A Statement it was shortly to lodge in
respect of a proposed takeover
bid for the Plaintiff.  The directors of the Defendant believed that they were
entitled to disclose
any information contained in the Information Memorandum by
reason of clauses 5(d) and 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement.  They
formed
the view that the information was not material to a shareholder of the
Plaintiff in deciding whether or not to accept the
Defendant's proposed bid
and, therefore, was not required to be disclosed in the Part A Statement.
<P>

28   	On 14 April 1999, the Defendant entered into a
pre-acceptance agreement with Portfolio Partners, under which Portfolio
Partners
agreed to accept the Defendant's takeover bid on the terms set out in
the agreement quoted earlier.
<P>

29   	On 14 April 1999 (the day before the Defendant announced
its bid), the Plaintiff's closing share price was 50 cents per share.
 It
increased to 72 cents per share within two days of the announcement and has
remained at 71 or 72 cents per share since that time.
<P>

30   	On 15 April 1999 the Defendant announced its intention to
make a takeover bid for the Plaintiff.
<P>

31   	The Part A Statement was lodged with ASIC on 15 April
1999, registered on 16 April, and served on the Plaintiff on 19 April.
<P>

32   	Section 637 of the <i>Corporations</i> <i>Law</i>, in
effect, provides that an offeror may serve its offer documents not earlier than
14 clear days after the day on which the Part
A Statement was served on the
target company. Accordingly, in the absence of a restraining order of the
court, having served the
Plaintiff on 19 April 1999, the Defendant would be
entitled to dispatch its offers immediately after midnight on 3 May 1999.
<P>

33   	On 20 April 1999, the Plaintiff made an announcement to
the Australian Stock Exchange stating, in part, that:
<P>

"Cultus Petroleum NL yesterday received a purported Part A Statement from OMV,
which is being reviewed by the Company.
<P>

Chairman, Mark Dunphy, has advised shareholders not to respond to the
unsolicited takeover offer from OMV pending full consideration
of the bid by
the Cultus Board in the context of advice to be received form the Company's
Bankers and other advisers.
<P>

The Board considered that the price of 66c is inadequate. To maximise returns
to shareholders, the board is prepared to consider
alternative offers and
proposals to the hostile bid received from OMV."
<P>

34   	These comments were reflected in newspaper articles
published across Australia on 21 April.
<P>

35   	On 28 April 1999, the Plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the
Defendant's solicitors detailing the Plaintiff's concerns regarding
the Part A
Statement, including that:
<P>

&#183;	the Part A omitted material information, which the Defendant was unable
to disclose as a result of an obligation of confidence
owed to the
Plaintiff;
<P>

&#183;	the pre-acceptance agreement between the Defendant and Portfolio
Partners breached s697 of the <i>Corporations</i> <i>Law</i>;
<P>

&#183;	ASIC modifications obtained by the Defendant, allowing the offer to be
extended to option holders who converted their options
prior to the close of
the offer, were invalid;
<P>

&#183;	the Part A inadequately disclosed various other matters.
<P>

The Defendant was asked to provide undertakings to the effect that it would
desist communication with the Plaintiff's shareholders,
and would desist making
public statements about the Plaintiff or the proposed bid, except as required
by law.
<P>

36   	On 29 April 1999, the Defendant's solicitors responded to
the points raised by the Plaintiff's solicitors in their letter
of 28 April
1999, and declined to give the requested undertakings.
<P>

37   	On 30 April 1999, the Plaintiff commenced these
proceedings by Summons filed in the Supreme Court of NSW. The Summons (and
supporting affidavits) were served on the Defendant's solicitors shortly before
5pm on Friday, 30 April.
<P>

38   	On 30 April 1999, the Plaintiff made an announcement to
shareholders in relation to the Defendant's bid.
<P>

<b>LEGAL QUESTIONS</b>
<P>

<b>Disclosure and Confidentiality</b>
<P>

39   	In answering those legal questions, I will deal with
factual matters over and above those set out in the Statement of Agreement
Facts, to the extent they bear upon the relevant issues.
<P>

<b><i>Legal Questions</i></b>
<P>

40   	(a)	Is the information contained in Information Memorandum
in connection with the sale of its interest in Gulf Australia Resources
Limited
pertaining to the Jabiru Challis Joint Venture material such as to require
disclosure by Cultus in its Part A Statement pursuant
to s750 cl 17 of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, being "other information material to the making of a
decision by an offeree whether or not to accept an offer, being information
that is known to the offeror and has not previously been disclosed to the
holder of shares in the target company", 
<P>

(b)	If so, is the information thus required to be disclosed or part thereof,
confidential and precluded from disclosure, or is disclosure
permitted
notwithstanding confidentiality by reason of the circumstances under which the
information became known to OMV and OMVA
and by reason of any relevant
exception contained in cl 5(d) of the Confidentiality Agreement and, to the
extent relevant, cl 14.01(b)
of the Joint Venture Agreement,
<P>

(c)	If the information is material and confidential and its disclosure
otherwise not permitted to be disclosed under any relevant
exception as
referred to in (b) above, is the offer precluded from proceeding until the
information ceases to be confidential or
material or is the conflict to be
resolved by giving cl 17 of s750 paramountcy over the private duty of
confidentiality such that
the Part A should cease to be injuncted from dispatch
when appropriately amended to include the relevant information or when it
ceases
to be confidential, and
<P>

(d)	If the information is material but not regarded as being subject to a duty
of confidentiality, should the Part A Statement be
injuncted until it is
amended (or ceases to be confidential) to incorporate the relevant information,
or should discretionary considerations
based on the balance of convenience and
the degree of materiality of the relevant information and its likely inclusion
in any Part
B Statement, favour allowing the offer to proceed having regard
also to Cultus' delay in bringing its proceedings?
<P>

<b>Relevant Principles</b>
<P>

41   	It is convenient to start with certain principles to be
applied in determining what is and is not material for the purposes
of cl
17.
<P>

(i)	The disclosure required by cl 17 is not to be read down in the light of the
earlier specific requirements for disclosure of
s750, for there is an
overriding requirement that no material information known to the offeror should
be omitted from the Part A
Statement; <i>Re Cumberland Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%201%20ACLR%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976)
1 ACLR 361</a> at 368-9; CLC 28,515 at 28,525; <i>Re Rossfield Group Operations Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20Qd%20R%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] Qd R 372</a> at 376;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%205%20ACLR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 5 ACLR 237</a> at 241; CLC 40-710 at 33,150;
<i>Re Evans Deakin Industries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%205%20ACLR%20322" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 5 ACLR 322</a> at 324; (1981) CLC
33,151 at 33,153.
<P>

(ii)	A matter is material in this context if it might reasonably affect, or
tend to affect the decision of the ordinary investor
whether or not to accept
the offer in the particular circumstances of the bid; <i>Cackett v Keswick</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1902%5d%202%20Ch%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1902] 2 Ch 456</a> at 464. Therefore, if a fact were omitted which, if known,
would have either tended to deter offerees from accepting the bid (<i>Re
Rossfield Group Operations Pty Ltd</i> (supra) at 376;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%205%20ACLR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 5 ACLR 237</a> at
241; CLC 40-710 at 33,149; <i>Carr Boyd Minerals Ltd v Queen Margaret Gold
Mines NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%207%20ACLC%201029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 7 ACLC 1029</a> at 1038, and in <i>Augold NL v Yaramin Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%205%20ACLC%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 5 ACLC 295</a> at 299) or would be likely to encourage offerees to
accept the bid, that fact is material. Thus a matter is material if it "is
necessary
to enable an offeree to make an informed assessment of the offer;
<i>Australian Consolidated Investments Ltd v Rossington Holdings Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/163.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 163</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2035%20FCR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 35 FCR 226.</a> 
<P>

(iii)	It has been put in the United States in relation to proxy solicitation
that it is not even necessary to prove that the fact,
if disclosed, would have
been likely to alter an investor's decision; that it is sufficient if the
omitted material would have assumed
actual significance in the deliberations of
reasonable offerees; <i>TSC Industries Inc v Northway Inc</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1976/119.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] USSC 119</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20426%20US%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 426 US
438</a>, applied in the United States to merger negotiations in <i>Basic Inc v
Levinson</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1988/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] USSC 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20485%20US%20224" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 485 US 224</a> at 231-2. Certainly, a fact would be
sufficiently material to fall within cl 17 if the information had a substantial
bearing on the
target's net worth, having regard to "competing possibilities
including offers from other sources"; see <i>Re Rossfield Group Operations Pty
Ltd</i>. In deciding what information is material, the Court should not
arrogate to itself the question whether those omitted facts are ones
which a
reasonable shareholder <i>would</i> consider significant, as distinct from an
omitted fact which would have a significant <i>propensity</i> to affect the
shareholder's decision. That is an argument for adopting the United States test
here, though always taking into account
in determining materiality the
circumstances of the takeover; for example whether or not there is a scrip bid.
However, that question
of a wider test for disclosure is best left for a case
which requires that issue be resolved.
<P>

(iv)	It is in the context of a scrip bid that an earnings forecast for the
offeror may assume greater significance than, as here,
a cash bid where the
principal question for the shareholder is whether the cash can be counted upon
having regard to the funding
of the offer and any conditions attaching to it.
Thus in <i>Pancontinental Mining Ltd v Goldfields Ltd</i> (1995) 16 ACSR 463,
in a scrip bid, Tamberlin J held that an earnings forecast for the offeror,
covering a two year period and spelling
out any assumptions and qualifications,
was required though not a discounted cashflow valuation of the offeror's
assets. Importantly,
he stated that earnings forecasts may not be essential in
every case as a matter of law. He held they were appropriate where the
offeror
in the case before him was a new company with no track record issuing its
shares rather than paying cash.
<P>

(v)	However, "the duty is a duty to disclose information and not speculation"
(<i>Wesfi Ltd v Blend Investments Pty Limited</i> (SCWA, Wheeler, J, 16 April
1999, unreported)). But it does not follow that any matter of prediction is of
necessity speculative.
That depends upon whether some reasonable basis in the
way of assumptions and material in support of those assumptions, as can be
tested, has also been included. As Wheeler J put it in  <i>Wesfi Ltd</i>
(supra); "While speculation is not required and is generally to be discouraged,
where speculative or predictive material is included,
there should be some
means of assessing that material" such as by "disclosure of assumptions upon
which any forecasts or assessments
are made and, where it exists, disclosure of
information relevant to the question of whether assumptions are likely to be
correct".
<P>

(vi)	It may thus be going too far to state, not only is there no obligation to
disclose, but there is a positive obligation <i>not</i> to disclose in a Part A
statement matters of opinion about which minds may differ, assessments that are
based on variable assumptions
or predictions, or the assumptions or predictions
upon which those assessments are based. The duty not to disclose such material
must depend firstly upon whether it is <i>mere</i> speculation, or instead a
prediction properly substantiated in a way which avoids that material being
misleading. Thus, for example,
forecasts which are subject to there being "no
major deterioration" in the market or the weather (<i>Re Primac Holdings Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%2022%20ACSR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 22 ACSR 212)</a> would not represent a proper substantiation if that
were all there were, and would be potentially misleading.
<P>

(vii)	The fact that a bid is a cash bid makes less relevant how valuable the
acquisition will be to the offeror, since the accepting
shareholder is not
concerned with the future value of the offeror's shares. Thus disclosure of the
offeror's future plans in relation
to the target need not be disclosed under cl
17; compare <i>Pancontinental Mining Limited</i> (supra) and <i>Solomon Pacific
Resources NL v Acacia Resources Ltd</i> <i>(No. 1)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2019%20ACSR%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 19 ACSR 238.</a>
Whether disclosure is required in a cash bid of some special value to the
offeror of the target, based on information concerning
the offeror not publicly
available, is a question not yet resolved; see the discussion in Renard and
Santamaria <i>Takeovers and Reconstructions in Australia</i> (Butterworths) at
8044.
<P>

(viii)	Whether the Court is dealing with an interlocutory or a final
injunction, the deficiencies in the Part A Statement should
be "clear and
serious" before an injunction will be granted; see <i>Wesfi Limited</i> and
also <i>Austen &amp; Butta Ltd v Shell Australia Ltd</i> &amp; Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2010%20ACLC%20735" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 10
ACLC 735</a>, <i>Australian Consolidated Investments Ltd v Rossington Holdings</i>
<i>(No. 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/163.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 163</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2010%20ACLC%20600" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 10 ACLC 600</a>, <i>Re Primac Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2022%20ACSR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 22 ACSR
212</a> and <i>GIO Australia Holdings Ltd v AMP Insurance Investment Holdings Pty
Ltd</i> (1998) 29 ACSR 584. In that context, short of an injunction the Court
has open to it the capacity to order that supplementary material
be sent where
this is capable of curing any less serious deficiency. The Court should not
lend itself to assisting tactical litigation
whose real purpose is not to
assist shareholders in being informed of all matters material to them, but
rather to delay the then
unpreferred bidder in the interests of encouraging
others. In recent times the courts have moved from a greater readiness to grant
injunctions of this kind to a more sceptical approach, as illustrated by the
recent cases dealing with merely speculative material
in Part A documents.
<P>

<b>Application of Principles</b>
<P>

42   	Against that background of principle, falls to be tested
the matter contained in the Information Memorandum. The Defendant
in its
written submissions of 3 May 1999 fairly describes the Information Memorandum
in the following terms:
<P>

"The Information Memorandum is a marketing document. It contains forecasts,
potential strategies and other speculative projections
which are dependent upon
factors and assumptions which are beyond the knowledge and/or control of OMVA,
cultus or Gulf -- such as
oil price movements, "probabilistic" geological and
other technical data. It contains an extensive disclaimer. The matters relied
upon by Cultus are described in the Information memorandum as a "conceptual
plan", by a vendor (Gulf) who has owned the assets for
only four months and is
now on-selling them. Analysis of the Joint Venture Agreement shows that the
potential cost reductions, production
increases and increases in reserves are
at a very early stage and highly speculative, and it is clear that there are
very many uncertainties
about whether they will or can be achieved. This is not
the sort of information with which s750, Pt A, cl 17 is concerned."
<P>

43   	The Defendant's witnesses were not cross-examined and
included Mr David Archibald, an independent expert resources analyst
whose
affidavit of 2 May 1999 demonstrates the kind of uncertainties referred to
above. Thus for example, he states that while he
was at Esso he was given a set
of field parameters for Jabiru by a broking analyst from a stockbroking firm
and calculated that recoverable
reserves were likely to be about 100 million
barrels. Following appraisal drilling at Jabiru by BHP, it downgraded its
estimate of
recoverable reserves to 18 million barrels. BHP subsequently sold
its interest in Jabiru to Gulf Australia. Paragraph 6.3.3 of the
Gulf
Information Memorandum states that Gulf Australia's estimate of ultimate
recoverable reserves at a figure markedly different;
I here avoid stating the
figure in order to avoid any potential breach of confidentiality.
<P>

44   	Mr Archibald gives further striking illustrations
including in relation to a joint venture group including Cultus which drilled
a
well called Cornea-1. Initially it was described by one of the Cornea joint
venturers as "big as Bass Strait". It has subsequently
been the subject of a
research report by Mr Archibald in June 1997 which concluded that any
development of the Cornea field would
be marginal and that the field is worth
significantly less than that reflected in the Cultus share price. Cornea is not
of course
one of the assets the subject of the Information Memorandum but is
illustrative of the problem.
<P>

45   	Similarly, Mr Archibald deals with the question of
potential cost reductions and points out that "there is considerable
uncertainty
as to whether or not further projected cost reductions ...... will
be able to be achieved or not" and noting that "5 million of these
projected
cost reductions are intended to arise from negotiations with four unions,
including the MUA".
<P>

46   	At paragraph 29 of his affidavit he states, 
<P>

"claims for potential cost reductions in respect of Jabiru/Challis could be
offset by shortfalls of field performance (relative
to prediction) as the
fields are late in their lives. Gulf Australia noted in paragraph 6.3.3 of the
Gulf Information Memorandum
`the complexity of the reserves and the inability
of the previous operator to history match the performance'."
<P>

(The above quotation appears to omit the words "effectively" before the word
"history".)
<P>

47   	The Plaintiff attempted to overcome this difficulty in its
case by evidence given by the General Manager of Cultus, Mr Graham
Dwyer,
particularly in his second affidavit of 3 May 1999. His first affidavit was
supplemented by a confidential exhibit "GD3" which
became PX4. In his first
affidavit of 30 April 1999 he described it in these terms:
<P>

"(a)	confidential information relating to the Jabiru Challis JV which is
contained in the Information Memorandum and which is not
contained in the Part
A Statement (<i>the Confidential Information</i>); and
<P>

(b)	the reasons I believe that the Confidential Information would be material
to a Cultus shareholder determining whether the takeover
offer made by OMVA in
the Part A Statement is adequate."
<P>

48   	It was stated in argument that PX4 was not intended to be
a statement of what should be included in the Part A Statement.
Rather it was
to be treated as a statement identifying the confidential information omitted
and reasons for why that information
would be material in the opinion of Mr
Dwyer.
<P>

49   	In fact the further evidence given by Mr Dwyer did more to
damage the Plaintiff's case than to assist it. In particular, both
his second
affidavit and his evidence in cross-examination made abundantly clear these
matters:
<P>

(a)	That 6.7 and 6.8 at pages 44 and 45 of the Information Memorandum state the
intentions of Gulf in its two year plan to lower
operating costs and otherwise
with respect to oil production rates and ultimate reserves, making clear there
is a substantial discrepancy
between the optimum outcome "unrisked" the terms
"unrisked" and "risked" can be illustrated by saying that the difference is
that
the risked reserve or result involves multiplying the unrisked reserve or
result by the probability of success, taking into account
the various risk
factors; see Transcript at 21. (described in PX4 as "potential" without mention
at all of risk) and the more realistic
outcome "risked"; yet only the unrisked
outcome is included in the later forecasts at pages 51 and 52 under the heading
"Proved and
Probable Profile" without any cross-reference to the earlier risk
factors or statement that the forecast is unrisked.
<P>

(b)	That the Information Memorandum required to be appraised and qualified by
reference to what was referred to in evidence as "actualities"
being in
particular:
<P>

(i)	knowledge of the negotiations with the MUA and other matters only capable
of being known through participation in the joint
venture with Gulf such as
knowledge of operating budgets, works programmes and numerous meetings,
conversations and correspondence
as well as knowledge of the actual production
rates in the first few months of 1999; see affidavit of Mr Dwyer of 3 May 1999
paras
7 to 13.
<P>

(ii)	file note of 1 April 1999 annexed to Mr Dwyer's affidavit in which the
dual options of proceeding with what is called the "Rapid
Oil Development Plan"
and abandonment are compared, and
<P>

(iii)	the Rapid Oil Development Plan itself which, though referred to in the
Information Memorandum, is not set out or annexed to
it but is an annexure to
Mr Dwyer's affidavit.
<P>

50   	It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of the potential
for misleading statements to be made in a Part A Statement, were
the Defendant
to take those parts of the Information Memorandum and quote them or excerpt
them in the Part A Statement. It is self-evident
from Mr Dwyer's evidence that
he himself could only appraise what is in the Information Memorandum by
reference to his knowledge
of the joint venture -- knowledge that is not known
to OMVA, and certainly not at the time of the lodgment of the Part A
Statement.
<P>

51   	Indeed this point was illustrated with quite dramatic
emphasis when, in cross-examination, Mr Dwyer had to acknowledge that
the final
paragraph ((e)) of PX4 in which he stated his estimate of the extent to which
the present value of Cultus' share of operating
cashflows would increase with
consequent increase in value in the share price of Cultus was substantially
based not on the Information
Memorandum alone but on the Information Memorandum
coupled with information he had derived from the joint venture itself, as set
out in PX7; see T,30-33 and in particular at T, 33 line 3-10 where he
acknowledges that "the joint venture parties though have more
material than is
available in the Information Memorandum". It is no answer to say that Gulf
itself drew upon that information in
preparing the Information Memorandum
because Gulf did not identify that information so drawn upon in the Memorandum
and clearly omitted
some material items.
<P>

52   	Against that description of what the Plaintiff contends is
material, it will be recalled that the Part A Statement already
states that
Cultus is engaged in the Gulf sale process. Furthermore, Cultus has conceded
that whatever constraints there may be on
confidentiality, if OMVA is allowed
to proceed with a valid Part A Statement, Cultus is not constrained in its Part
B Statement from
stating that which it contends is material, drawing in its
case upon all of the information that it has including not only from the
Information Memorandum but also as a participant in the joint venture. 
<P>

53   	I should add that no argument was put that information
derived from what is termed "Data Room Information" would have required
separate disclosure in the Part A Statement and likewise nothing to suggest
that information relating to what is termed the "Joint
Study and Bidding
Group", or the terms of the North Sea Oil Contract should have been disclosed
independently of what is in the Information
Memorandum by OMVA. Indeed it was
not disputed that the Bidding Group broke up without making a bid for the
subject tenements nor
that the North Sea Oil Contract was on other than
ordinary commercial terms. Furthermore, it was not disputed that certain of the
information, being the Data Room Information was not in the possession of OMVA
at the date of the Part A Statement, and accordingly
its non-disclosure could
not be a contravention of s750.
<P>

54   	There is one further matter of some significance. Whilst
neither OMVA or its affiliates are quoted companies in Australia,
Cultus is. As
such, Cultus is subject to the continuous disclosure requirements of the ASX.
Section 3.1 requires that once an entity
"is or becomes aware of any
information concerning it that a reasonable person would expect to have a
material effect on the price
or value of the entity's securities, the entity
must immediately tell ASX that information", unless the information satisfies
each
of the following three cumulative requirements.
<P>

55   	The exceptions by way of three cumulative requirements, I
quote below:
<P>

"3.1.1	A reasonable person would not expect the information to be disclosed.
<P>

3.1.2	The information is confidential.
<P>

3.1.3	One or more of the following applies.
<P>

(a)	It would be a breach of a law to disclose the information.
<P>

(b)	The information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation.
<P>

(c)	The information comprises matters of supposition or is insufficiently
definite to warrant disclosure.
<P>

(d)	The information is generated for the internal management purposes of the
entity.
<P>

(e)	The information is a trade secret."
<P>

56   	Cultus was advised on 30 April 1999 by Allen Allen &amp;
Hemsley that the continuous disclosure requirements did not apply
and state in
the concluding paragraph of that letter: 
<P>

"We are satisfied that there is material information that falls within one or
more of the exceptions set out in Listing Rule 3.1.3.
Those exceptions apply to
confidential information if:
<P>

&#183;	the information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation;
<P>

&#183;	the information comprises matters of supposition or insufficiently
definite to warrant disclosure;
<P>

&#183;	the information is generated for the internal management purposes of the
company.
<P>

(Cultus should not pursue allegations of non-disclosure in relation to
information which should be disclosed under Listing Rule
3.1.)"
<P>

The above advice is contained in its letter of advice of 30 April 1999 being
DX5
<P>

57   	Clearly enough Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley did not
differentiate between whether the information concerned an "incomplete proposal
or negotiation" or whether the information comprised "matters of supposition or
insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure" or
for that matter generated for
internal management purposes. However, in argument, it was put that the basis
for considering that
3.1.3 applied was solely that the information concerned an
incomplete proposal. While it is not necessary for me to determine whether
that
contention is correct, on one view of matters the only aspect of incompleteness
about the proposal, being the Rapid Oil Development
Plan is that such programme
requires to be put by the operator (Gulf) to the participants including Cultus
before it could be carried
out, insofar as it involved the expenditure of
significant amount of money, and that had not taken place. That indeed
emphasises
the speculative character of the programme itself, though insofar as
Cultus may have knowledge as a joint venturer of its prospects,
it is in a
different position in terms of the superiority of its knowledge than OMVA.
However, be that as it may, there must be some
question as to whether Cultus is
now obliged to make disclosure under Rule 3.1, having regard to the cumulative
requirements of the
relevant exception and noting that requirement 3.1.1 has
not been addressed. It has been assumed that the information is confidential.
This is either in the sense that the ASX uses that term in the sense of
"secret" such that confidentiality in this sense will not
exist simply because
a confidentiality agreement has been entered into (ASX Guidance Note:
Continuance Disclosure: Rule 3.1, para
20) or in the sense that it has some
trade significance to Cultus, which is the only entity at this point asserting
confidentiality.
Thus (T, 32) the following question and answer concedes the
latter does not apply either:
<P>

"Q	And there is nothing particularly secret or sensitive about any of that, is
there?
<P>

A	Secret or sensitive I'm not sure how -- I would say it is certainly still
information that is confidential to the joint venture.
<P>

Q	I know you say that, but it is not information which needs to be hidden from
competitors because a competitor cannot have any
influence on it?
<P>

A	I think that is a fair statement, yes."
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

58   	I am satisfied that the materials contained in the
Information Memorandum were not such as should have been required to be
disclosed by OMVA in its Part A Statement, on the basis that its disclosure
would have been of speculative material which was potentially
misleading and
that OMVA, given the state of its knowledge, was not capable of adding such
additional information as would be capable
of rendering it in a form where it
could be provided to shareholders in a way that was not potentially misleading.
In particular,
OMVA did not have access to any materials outside the
Information Memorandum such as are available to Cultus as a joint venturer.
In
so concluding, I do not wish it to be understood that Cultus should in any way
be precluded from disclosing such information in
its Part B Statement, provided
it is disclosed in a way that is not misleading and in particular provided it
is disclosed in a way
that identifies relevant risks in a fair manner.
<P>

<b>Confidentiality</b>
<P>

59   	In light of the conclusion I have earlier reached, it is
not necessary for me to consider whether the relevant materials are
confidential and such as could not be disclosed under any relevant exception to
the constraints on disclosure contained in the confidentiality
agreement, and,
so far as relevant, the joint venture agreement. However, I deal with both
those matters briefly now.
<P>

60   	The starting point is clause 5(d) of the Confidentiality
Agreement. This permits disclosure of confidential information, where
that
information is: 
<P>

"required to be disclosed under applicable law or by a governmental decree,
order, regulation or rule or by any legal process, whether
or not the
requirement arises independently or as a result of any action taken by the
Receiving Party before or after the date of
this agreement."
<P>

61   	Clause 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement provides a
warranty and representation that the disclosing party has the right
and
authority to disclose its Confidential Information to the Receiving Party.
<P>

62   	Clearly enough the words starting "whether or not" remove
any possible argument that the disclosure could not be "required
to be
disclosed under applicable law" where that requirement arises by virtue of an
action, here issuing a Part A Statement following
announcement of an offer,
taken by the Receiving Party OMVA. It is true that the parent company OMVA
received the material, but OMVA
as the Receiving Party is by clause 6 of the
Confidentiality Agreement permitted to disclose it to "an Affiliate of the
Receiving
Party". No suggestion was made that the "Receiving Party" namely OMVA
has failed to ensure that the Affiliate to whom disclosure
is made, is made
aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information.
<P>

63   	However, the Plaintiff contends that while concededly OMVA
and OMV could not have been on notice of any constraint under the
joint venture
agreement applicable to the Disclosing Party, Gulf Canada Resources Limited,
OMVA is now on notice of a constraint
under the joint venture agreement, namely
that contained in clause 14.01(b). It then contends that if now, being informed
of such
constraint, OMVA seeks to include the relevant information from the
Information Memorandum, on the assumption that it is obliged
by law to do so,
it is on notice of the constraint and cannot do so. This is because there is no
applicable exception to the constraint
in the joint venture agreement which
would free Gulf to impart it to OMV and through OMV to OMVA, or which would
free OMVA in turn
to disclose it in the Part A Statement.
<P>

64   	Thus the Defendant contends that the fact that OMV and
OMVA believed, in good faith, that the exception in its Confidentiality
Agreement was one that Gulf was entitled to make does not alter the fact that
OMVA is now aware of the confidential nature of the
information and of the fact
that it can only be disclosed with the consent of all joint venture parties. In
<i>Malone v Commissioner of Police</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20All%20ER%20620" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 All ER 620</a>, it was held that
where confidential information has been disclosed to a third party, who at the
time of disclosure is unaware of
any breach of any obligation of confidence but
subsequently becomes aware of that breach, the third party becomes obliged to
maintain
the confidentiality of the information.
<P>

65   	Sir Robert Megarry V-C (at page 634) held that 
<P>

"if A makes a confidential communication to B, then A may not only restrain B
from divulging or using the confidence, but may also
restrain C from divulging
or using it if C has acquired it from B, even if he acquired it without notice
of any impropriety. See
the authority cited in Snell's Equity, one of which,
Printers &amp; Finishers Ltd v Holloway  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20WLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 WLR 1</a> at 7 was put before me.
In such cases it seems plan that, however innocent the acquisition of the
knowledge, what will be restrained
is the use or disclosure of it after notice
of the impropriety."
<P>

In this case, notice of a breach of the confidentiality obligation under the
Joint Operating Agreement was given by the Plaintiff's
solicitor to the
Defendant's solicitors by letter on 29 April 1999.
<P>

66   	To this contention, the Plaintiff has two answers. The
first is that a relevant exception does apply in clause 14.01(b), namely
(aa)
read with (dd). Second, in any event either such conflict is to be overridden
by giving cl 17 paramountcy over the private duty
of confidentiality, or as the
Defendant prefers, there is no such conflict simply because in these special
and particular circumstances,
the Defendant has altered its position in good
faith by incurring binding legal obligations and in circumstances where the
rights
of third parties, namely shareholders in the Plaintiff, would otherwise
be deprived of a bid.
<P>

67   	So far as the relevant exception is concerned, clause
14.01(b)(i)(aa) is said to apply because OMVA is a "bona fide intended
assignee" of the relevant Gulf company, which has entered into a "similar
undertaking of confidentiality ...... in favour of all
the Parties". Note the
undertaking only has to be "similar", not "the same".
<P>

68   	It is then contended that whilst para (dd) of the clause
14.01(b)(i) does not contain the extra words in the Confidentiality
Agreement
starting with "whether or not the requirement arises independently ......"
nonetheless all that is required is a "similar"
undertaking and such an
undertaking so qualified is sufficiently similar. That contention is disputed
by the Plaintiff who contends
that the words in the exception in clause
14.01(b)(i)(dd), only contemplate being subjected to applicable mandatory laws
requiring
disclosure where this is not the result of an action which the party
has independently chosen to take, such as here announcing a
takeover offer and
lodging a Part A Statement.
<P>

69   	The Plaintiff relies on the judgment of Moynihan J in
<i>Queensland Coal Pty Ltd v Arco Resources Limited &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QSC/1998/222.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] QSC
222</a> (20 October 1998) which involved disclosure in a registration statement
required pursuant to the United States Securities Act 1933.
However, the
wording in that case was different from the wording in clause 14.01(b) in that
the words used were: "required pursuant
to <i>necessarily applicable</i>
legislation ......." [my emphasis]. Moynihan J held that the clause in the
agreement before him "is absolute in that it does not
qualify or juxtapose
necessity by linking it with other considerations; for example expedience or
convenience so as to provide a
margin of discretion ...... the test of stark
necessity is a strict one reinforced by the limitation `if and to the extent
required'
in clause 18.1(b) ...... I do not think that the Securities Act 1933
is necessarily applicable legislation in terms of clause 18.1(b)."
<P>

70   	Here, there is no requirement that the legislation be
"necessarily applicable". All that is necessary is that there be a requirement
of any applicable laws, with no provision precluding the recipient of the
information from subjecting itself to a compulsory disclosure
law as would
arise on the making of a takeover offer.
<P>

71   	However, even if I were wrong in that conclusion, I am
satisfied that the only obligation of confidentiality which applies
to OMVA, if
any applies at all, is an equitable obligation to maintain the confidentiality
of that which it now has notice but did
not have notice at the relevant times.
These times were when it issued the Part A Statement and earlier when it
entered into the
Confidentiality Agreement and expressly negotiated words which
left no room for argument that it was free to bid and disclose compulsorily
as
a result.
<P>

72   	Having subsequently lodged and served its Part A OMVA has
radically altered its situation by being subjected to an obligation
to proceed
with its bid which arose before OMVA had any notice of any constraint
indirectly applicable via the joint venture agreement.
In those special and
particular circumstances, and having regard also to the interests of innocent
third parties being shareholders
in Cultus who would otherwise be deprived of
an offer, I am satisfied that OMVA is not precluded by any such equitable
obligation,
if it exists, from disclosure of the relevant confidential
information.
<P>

73   	Finally, even if there were a conflict between cl 17 and a
private equitable duty of confidentiality, cl 17 must prevail.
These
circumstances are very different from those before Brownie J in <i>Austen &amp;
Butta Ltd v Shell Australia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d93%29%2010%20ACSR%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-93) 10 ACSR 556</a>, where the relevant
offeror had entered into a consent order precluding the offeror from disclosing
information obtained from the
target in confidence. Brownie J concluded that
the Defendant's consent to the grant of the interlocutory injunction required
the
Defendant to show a significant change in circumstances or that new facts
had been discovered which rendered enforcement of the earlier
order unjust. At
561, Brownie J made clear that he was not deciding the kind of case now before
me:
<P>

"It may also be that, in another case, an offeror may be permitted to disclose
in a Part A statement material which he obtained
in confidence or in breach of
fiduciary duty, but this question does not arise for decision now. Nor is it
necessary to decide now
whether a target company must in any event disclose the
relevant information in its Part B statement, although the language of s750,
Part B, cl 13 seems to be fairly explicit.
<P>

It may also be that, in other circumstances, an offeror who is in possession of
information which is confidential to the target
company cannot make a Part A
statement without offending against the provisions of s750 Part A, cl 17, or
without exposing himself
to some claim by the target company for relief; and it
may follow that, in such a case that s750 means that he cannot make a takeover
offer at all; but neither of these questions needs to be decided now."
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

74   	If, contrary to the conclusion I have earlier reached, the
material in question were such as required to be disclosed in the
Defendant's
Part A Statement, I am satisfied that it could be so disclosed without
contravention of any confidentiality obligation
in the circumstances in which
the relevant information was obtained.
<P>

<b>DISCRETION</b>
<P>

75   	If, contrary to the conclusion I have earlier reached
concerning materiality, the Part A Statement should have included materials
derived from the Information Memorandum, such contraventions that have occurred
are minor in character. It can reasonably be anticipated
that the Part B
Statement will draw upon both the joint venture information and the Information
Memorandum in making such disclosure
as Cultus is obliged and entitled to make,
avoiding being misleading. It is for the directors of Cultus to put such
matters by way
of advocacy as would properly dissuade acceptance, being both
accurate and not misleading. It is not for the bidder in the Part A,
provided
it has disclosed in accordance with cl 17 and s750. 
<P>

76   	The other factors going to balance of convenience
including the interests of shareholders in Cultus who would otherwise be
deprived of an offer from OMVA and Cultus' delay in seeking relief, strongly
militate against any injunction being granted in the
circumstances. 
<P>

77   	There has developed a pattern in takeover defences in
indulging in wasteful and expedient tactical litigation, designed not
for the
benefit of ensuring that shareholders are properly informed but simply to buy
time. To issue proceedings such as this at
the last minute casts doubt upon the
bona fides of the Plaintiff, an impression reinforced by a number of other
grounds raised and
subsequently abandoned as to the alleged misleading nature
of the Part A Statement. That is not to say that in a proper case where
a Part
A statement is misleading the target should not take proper action promptly to
restrain the sending out of the offer or at
any rate restrain it until
appropriate additional material has been included. This was not such a case.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

78   	The Plaintiff's summons should be dismissed. No occasion
arises for my making any remedial order pursuant to s743 of the <i>Corporations
Law</i> in relation to the Defendant's Cross-Claim.
<P>

79   	Costs ordinarily should follow the event and I give leave
to the parties to address me on costs if they wish.
