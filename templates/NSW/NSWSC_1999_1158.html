<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	By statement of claim filed on 13 June 1996 the plaintiff
claims damages from the defendant for personal injury she alleges
was caused
while she was employed by the defendant and as a result of the defendant's
negligence.  The defendant has admitted that
it was in breach of its duty of
care to her.  The issues that are expected to arise include the nature of the
injury sustained by
the plaintiff, the causation of subsequent injury, and the
extent (if any) for which the plaintiff is herself responsible for the
injury
and its sequelae.  On 13 September 1999 the plaintiff, as is her right, filed a
requisition for trial by jury.  There is some
question as to whether this
requisition was filed within the time prescribed.  On 24 September the trial
was fixed for a hearing
to commence on 7 February 2000, with two weeks of court
time allocated.  
<P>

2   	The defendant, on 1 October 1999, filed a notice of motion
seeking, inter alia, an order pursuant to s 89 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act
1970</a>, </i>that all issues of fact be tried without a jury.  A further order
sought by the defendant was that the plaintiff's requisition for
jury trial be
set aside.  The basis for seeking this order was the defendant's contention
that the requisition was filed out of time.
 
<P>

3   	After discussion, Mr Cranitch SC, who appeared on the
application for the defendant, accepted that the substance of the application
was whether the defendant was able to establish its case for trial without a
jury, and that, if there were some technical defect
in the filing of the
plaintiff's requisition, the powers conferred by the rules would be
appropriately be exercised to cure that
defect.  It was therefore possible to
proceed to deal with the single issue of substance.  
<P>

4   	The relevant law is well established and uncomplicated.  By
s 86 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>,</i> any party to proceedings of the kind the
plaintiff brings is entitled to requisition trial by jury.  By s 89, in such
proceedings
the court may order, despite s 86, that all or any issues of fact
be tried without a jury.  The onus lies on the party seeking to
displace the
requisitioning party's right to trial by jury to show that that party should be
deprived of his/her/its choice of mode
of trial: <b>Pambula District Hospital
v  Herriman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 387.</a>  
<P>

<b>The substantive proceedings</b>
<P>

5   	It is common ground, at least for the purposes of this
application, that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a cleaner
in a
service station complex at Clybucca.  On 16 June 1993 she used a chemical
provided to her in a milk bottle.  She developed symptoms
on her skin.
Thereafter there were, apparently, complications.  A medical history, the
accuracy of which was not challenged for the
purpose of this application, is
conveniently contained in a report of Dr R Milton dated 31 January 1997.  In
January 1995 the plaintiff's
right hand and lower arm were amputated.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff's claim is that the amputation was a result
of the injury in June 1993.  The defendant's case is that the explanation
for
the amputation is that, over the period since June 1993, the plaintiff
inflicted injury upon herself, culminating in the amputation.
 Dr Milton has
diagnosed Munchausen's Syndrome.  A plastic surgeon, Dr McKessar, shares the
view that the plaintiff's continuing
symptoms were the result of self-inflicted
injury.
<P>

7   	As a practical matter, if not in strict law, an evidentiary
onus will be cast upon the defendant to persuade the tribunal of
fact that that
diagnosis is correct, and it is apparent that the defendant has recognised and
accepted that reality.  In order to
discharge that onus the defendant proposes
to call a very large number of medical practitioners.  Annexed to an affidavit
sworn by
Ms S J Mooyaart Jones, a solicitor employed by the solicitor for the
defendant, is a list of doctors whose reports have been served
by the parties
on one another.  There are twenty-one practitioners qualified by the defendant,
fifteen by the plaintiff.  As well,
the plaintiff proposes to rely upon the
evidence of experts in other fields.  As I perceive the defendant's plan of
action, it is
to show:
<P>

(i)	that the chemical injury it acknowledges the plaintiff suffered could not
have resulted in the history of symptomatology of
which she subsequently
complained;
<P>

(ii)	that the chemical to which the plaintiff was exposed could not have caused
the complications recorded;
<P>

(iii)	that the plaintiff's personal history is such as is consistent with
personal histories of individuals diagnosed as suffering
Munchausen's
Syndrome;
<P>

(iv)	that the plaintiff's own medical history shows that she has undergone
various procedures which are, at the very least, questionable,
and which, put
together, show that she has a history of putting herself in the position of
undergoing unnecessary surgical procedures.
<P>

8   	To establish the last of these it may be necessary to
explore some, if not all, of the individual procedures and their apparent
justification (or otherwise).  Thus, it was argued on behalf of the defendants,
a jury would be faced with a complex array of technical
and medical evidence,
including evidence relating to the nature of the chemical.  Further, it would
have before it effectively the
plaintiff's entire medical history.
<P>

9   	However, Mr Cranitch did not press with great vigour the
complexity of the expert material alone as the basis for the application.
 It
became apparent that the substantial basis of the application was the perceived
credibility hurdle the defendants would face
in presenting that case to a jury
of men and women drawn from the community generally.  Borrowing from the
language of Dr McKessar,
Mr Cranitch submitted that the notion of
self-inflicted injury, certainly of the nature and extent here in question is
or would be
so "repugnant" to the ordinary person that one could not ask or
expect four members of the community to believe it.  Far better,
he argued, to
leave it to the clinical mind of a judge, whose revulsion at the concept would
more readily be able to be put to one
side.
<P>

10   	So to frame the argument exposes its fallacy.  Juries are
chosen daily, in the criminal courts, to adjudicate on conduct entirely
alien
to the vast majority of the citizenry.  They are chosen in civil and criminal
cases to evaluate technical expert evidence,
and in civil cases to perform
complex mathematical calculations.  They are an important part of the
administration of civil and criminal
justice.  In criminal cases they are
entrusted with the compliance with directions of law that must sometimes seem
absurd (such as
completely putting out of their minds evidence about what one
co-accused has said of another). 
<P>

11   	I see no reason why a jury cannot be trusted to evaluate
in the same objective way the issues that arise in this case.
<P>

12   	Reference was made by Mr Cranitch to some supporting
matters, such as the likelihood that the duration of the trial will be
increased if it is to be conducted before a jury, and that there will be
difficulty and expense in presenting all the evidence orally
through witnesses
who will have to be marshalled in a logical sequence in order to present the
case in a rational way to a jury.
 These are insufficient of themselves to
justify depriving the plaintiff of her right to trial by jury.  They do not
strengthen the
proposition founded upon the asserted incapacity of a jury to
come to grips with an unusual psychiatric illness with which I have
already
dealt.
<P>

13   	The notice of motion is dismissed with costs.
