EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

HAMILTON J
<P>

WEDNESDAY, 17 MARCH 1999
<P>

<b>1682/99	MARGARET CAROLINE FORD v DANIEL ARTHUR BIRT</b>
<P>

<b>3597/97	MARGARET CAROLINE FORD v DANIEL ARTHUR BIRT</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	This matter has come before me as an application for the extension of a
caveat which expires today.  The caveat, in terms, claims:
<P>

"Equitable ownership by the caveator of new house and 100 acres around house on
the land."
<P>

The background is that the plaintiff is a daughter, and the defendant the
executor of her mother's estate.  The mother owned rural
land of about 600
acres and during her lifetime, it is alleged by the plaintiff, that the
daughter and her husband, at their own
expense, built a house on that land.
The balance of the plaintiff's case is put alternatively that there was such a
promise and/or
conduct by the mother as ought lead to a constructive trust
being declared of the house and 100 acres of land around it in favour
of the
daughter, or that, at the very least, there should be a charge under the
principle of <b>Morris v Morris</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%2061" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 61</a> declared in the
daughter's favour in respect of moneys invested in the house.  Either of these,
it is said, would be a caveatable
interest, although it is the former and not
the latter that is adverted to in the caveat in fact on the title.
<P>

2	I should say at once that there are also pending between the same parties in
this Division of the Court proceedings under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a> (the
FPA) in which the daughter claims provision out of the mother's estate.  It may
be that the provision would be granted.  The
alleged promise of part of the
land is obviously relevant to those proceedings and provision may, if
circumstances were appropriate,
be made in the form of an order to transfer
part of the land.  Certainly it would be difficult for the mother's estate to
be dealt
with in the FPA proceedings independently of it being, or before it
was, determined whether the daughter had a proprietary right
in the subject
land.
<P>

3	Mr Relf, the solicitor for the defendant, has drawn attention to a number of
difficulties with the existing caveat, and those
difficulties are of some
substance.  The only one that I need to advert to in these short reasons for
judgment is the lack of definition
of the 100 acres of land referred to.
Certainly the property is not at the present time subdivided, so that there is
no parcel with
separate title representing the 100 acres referred to.  There
may be difficulties about the 100 acres being able to be defined at
the present
time, though it is not clear that that difficulty is such as would necessarily
defeat the plaintiff's ultimate claim.
<P>

4	For this and various other reasons I do not propose to extend the caveat, as
I do not, in these circumstances, think that the
most satisfactory
interlocutory regime is by way of caveat.  I do, however, on the application
made today by Miss Webster, of counsel
for the plaintiff, and subject to the
giving of an appropriate undertaking as to damages, propose to grant relief by
way of injunction.
 Mr Relf has no instructions which would permit him to
consent to the injunction, although he has very sensibly and usefully
cooperated
with Miss Webster in bringing forward a form of injunction that
would meet the circumstances, if I were minded to grant an injunction.
 I am of
the view that a sufficient case is made out on the plaintiff's material read
before me for it to be appropriate for injunctive
relief to be granted and, in
addition, the balance of convenience, it seems to me, favours the granting of
an injunction in the form
that has been drafted.
<P>

5	Whilst it is not appropriate within the administrative arrangements of this
Division of the Court for me, not being an Expedition
Judge for 1999, to make
an order for expedition, I do think it appropriate that I make an order that
these proceedings and the FPA
proceedings, to which I have already referred, be
heard at the same time and to refer both matters to the Expedition Judge in the
near future for his attention, and that is the course I propose to take.
<P>

6	Mr Relf has pressed on me that I ought deal with the question of costs today
and that the defendant should receive a favourable
order for costs, as he was
always ready to come to some appropriate regime and a communication was sent to
the plaintiff to this
effect yesterday.  There is some uncertainty as to the
precise form in which the communication was sent and, bearing that in mind,
together with other circumstances of the case, in my view this is one of those
occasions where it would be better to reserve the
costs of the interlocutory
application, so that they may be considered after the issues between the
parties have been resolved, and
that is what I propose to do.
<P>

7	I make the following orders:
<P>

1	In proceedings 1682/99 I make orders in accordance with the short minutes
initialled by me and placed with the papers.
<P>

2	In proceedings 3597/97 I order that these proceedings be tried at the same
time as proceedings 1682/99 and that the evidence in
the one be evidence in the
other, subject to relevance.
<P>

3	I order that both sets of proceedings stand over to 19 March 1999 before the
Expedition Judge.
