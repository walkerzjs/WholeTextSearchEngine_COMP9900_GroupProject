WEDNESDAY 7 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>11676/1998</u>	<u>MICHAEL JOHN VAUGHAN v ROBERT FULTON</u> 
<P>

<u>DRIVER</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	A Summons was filed on 7 July 1998.  It seeks relief by way of
appeal from a determination of a Costs Assessor (Mr Salier) issued
on 6 March
1998.  An Amended Summons was filed on 17 September 1998.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff is a solicitor.  He was retained by Mr Kelly (inter
alia in respect of proceedings brought in this Court).  The
defendant is a
barrister.  He was briefed inter alia to appear in those proceedings.  It
appears that there was no marked brief.
 He performed certain work (including
appearing on three days at a hearing during June 1995).  A brief had been first
delivered in
about November 1994 and the first work was done on 25 November
1994.  The defendant rendered a Memorandum of Fees dated 31 August
1995.  The
total of fees claimed was $8,000.00.  He has been paid $3,000.00 (two payments
of $1,500.00 were made in July 1995).
<P>

3  	A dispute arose as to the unpaid balance of the fees rendered by
the defendant.  The plaintiff claimed that there had been an
agreement to the
effect that the fees would not exceed $3,000.00.
<P>

4  	The defendant made application to this Court for an assessment.
Mr Salier was appointed as the Costs Assessor.  The Costs Assessor
heard from
the parties (he received inter alia a Notice of Objection, a response thereto
and numerous submissions).  He then made
a determination in the sum of
$7,250.00.  The certificate was issued on 6 March 1998.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff made a complaint to the Legal Services Commission
regarding the conduct of the defendant.  The complaint was considered
at a
meeting held on 18 February 1999.  The Council resolved that the complaint be
dismissed.  The plaintiff was notified of this
decision by letter dated 2 March
1999.
<P>

6  	On 24 September 1998 these proceedings had been stood over
generally with liberty to restore on 7 days notice.  This was done
to abide the
hearing of other proceedings.  The other proceedings were disposed of on 17
September 1998.
<P>

7  	The proceedings have been brought out of time (about 2 months).
Accordingly, they cannot be maintained unless an extension of
time to bring
them is first granted by the Court.
<P>

8  	On 11 March 1999, the defendant filed a Notice of Motion.  It
sought a dismissal of the proceedings for want of prosecution.
<P>

9  	On 5 May 1999, a special fixture was allocated at the request of
the parties.  A hearing took place on 18 June 1999.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff identified s 208M of the <u>Legal Professional
Act</u> 1987 (the Act) as the source for the relief claimed by him.  This is a
provision which enables a court to give leave to appeal in
an appropriate case.
The Court has a discretionary power.  It is exercised having regard to the
circumstances of the particular case
before it and so that justice is best
served between the parties.  The onus of demonstrating an entitlement to such
relief rests
with the plaintiff.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff conceded that it needed an extension of time for
the bringing of the application for leave.  By consent, the
application for
extension of time and the application for leave were heard together.
<P>

12  	Apart from some affidavit material, the Court had before it the
Costs Assessor's file (Exhibit A) and a letter dated 28 August
1998 from the
Costs Assessor (Exhibit B).
<P>

13  	It appears that the Costs Assessor did not deliver reasons as
such at the time of the issue of the certificate.  The certificate
had been
issued at a time when the prevailing view was that a Costs Assessor was not
required to give reasons.  Subsequently, the
defendant made a request for
reasons.  The reasons were provided in the letter dated 28 August 1998 (Exhibit
B).
<P>

14  	Initially, the plaintiff had proceeded to present a case on the
basis that there had been a failure to give reasons.  When
the contents of
Exhibit B had been brought to the attention of the plaintiff, there was a
change of stance and the parties proceeded
on the basis that reasons had been
given.  Later, there was some muted challenge to the sufficiency of the
disclosed reasoning process.
 In my view, this was a contention lacking in
merit.
<P>

15  	Perhaps, at this stage, I should digress to observe that a mere
failure to express reasons as such may be of no moment.  There
will be cases
where the reasoning process is sufficiently disclosed from the certificate and
other material (including communications
passing between the Costs Assessor and
the parties).  This was certainly one of those cases (inter alia, in
correspondence the Costs
Assessor refers to "a clear issue which had
developed").  This matter does not need to be further pursued because in this
case the
reasoning process has been expressly disclosed (both in Exhibit B and
in a letter dated 10 July 1998 addressed to the Legal Services
Commissioner).
In my view, this material more than sufficiently discloses the reasoning
process.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff contends that an agreement was reached with the
defendant that his fees would not exceed $3,000.00 in total.
 It was said to
have been made in a conference when inter alia the client was present.  This
was the matter agitated before the Costs
Assessor.  This was the matter
agitated before this Court.
<P>

17  	The relationship between the parties is acrimonious.  The
defendant has vigorously disputed that any such agreement was made.
 He made
submissions in support of that view.  In those submissions, he drew attention
to documentation and other matters which supported
his stance.
<P>

18  	The plaintiff has placed great stress on three Statutory
Declarations (one of which was made by the plaintiff).  The defendant
did not
provide any Statutory Declaration (it does not appear that he was asked to
provide one).  The plaintiff has adopted the stance
that these declarations
therefore conclusively established that the agreement as alleged was made in
conference with the defendant.
<P>

19  	This stance fails to address the shortcomings of the
declarations and the body of other material which presents a different
picture.
The Statutory Declarations were short on detail and inter alia failed to
identify the date of the alleged agreement (despite
a request from the Costs
Assessor that this matter be addressed).  In presenting his case to the Costs
Assessor conflicting dates
appear to have been advanced as the date on which
the relevant conference was said to take place (initially it was said that the
agreement was reached prior to any work being undertaken).  The defendant has a
record of only one conference at which the plaintiff
may not have been present.
For present purposes, I need not dwell on other unsatisfactory features of
these documents.
<P>

20  	The Costs Assessor had a formidable body of material placed
before him.  Apart from the Statutory Declarations he had the plaintiff's
file,
the Notice of Objections and response thereto together with submissions and
other documentation.
<P>

21  	The Costs Assessor gave the plaintiff opportunity to deal with
specific matters which gave him concern (see letter dated 19
January 1998).
The Statutory Declarations were provided in an endeavour to deal with these
matters.  The Costs Assessor has expressly
stated that he took these
declarations into account.  It is also clear that he did not prefer their
contents to what was thrown up
by other material.  The material placed before
the Costs Assessor disclosed circumstances and documentation (including the
plaintiff's
own documentation) which either did not support or stood in
conflict with the alleged agreement.  He had material which supported
a finding
that the defendant had agreed to appear at the rate of $1,500.00 per day.
<P>

22  	In the light of all of the material, the Costs Assessor decided
that on balance the issue agitated between the parties should
be determined in
favour of the defendant (the agreement alleged by the plaintiff could not be
substantiated notwithstanding the Statutory
Declarations).  In my view, not
only was that view open to him, it was the correct decision.
<P>

23  	In my view, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate either an
error of law or any other basis which would justify the granting
of relief.
<P>

24  	There is clearly no utility in granting an extension of time to
maintain these proceedings.  In these circumstances, it is
unnecessary to
explore the question of whether or not a sufficient explanation has been
provided for the failure to bring the proceedings
in time.  However, I will
assist by observing that little is offered by way of explanation and it falls
short of being satisfactory.
<P>

25  	Accordingly, I refuse both the application for extension of time
and the application for leave.  I might add that the delay
and the inadequacy
of the explanation for the delay in bringing these proceedings to a hearing may
of themselves have sufficed to
justify a dismissal of the Summons.
<P>

26  	For completeness, I should observe that these proceedings appear
to have generated costs which are grossly disproportionate
to the modest amount
in dispute (in the order of $4,000.00).
<P>

27  	Accordingly, I order that the proceedings be dismissed.  The
plaintiff is to pay the costs of the proceedings.  The exhibits
are to be
returned.
<P>
