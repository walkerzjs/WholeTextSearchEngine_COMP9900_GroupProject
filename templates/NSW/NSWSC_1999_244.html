<b><u>020524/94  -  EDWARD PALMER v FRANK BELAN &amp; ANOR</u></b>

<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT  (re costs)</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b> On 12 March 1999 I gave judgment in respect of three
actions for defamation against the defendant, Frank Belan, who is a party to
each action, and against Mr Casey who is a party to two of the actions. In
giving judgment I awarded damages to each plaintiff as
set out in para 295.
<P>

2	In the case of Mr Boner, in his action against Mr Belan and Mr Casey, I
awarded $75,000 plus costs.  In the case of Mr Palmer,
in his action against Mr
Belan and Mr Casey, I awarded $65,000 plus costs.  In the other action by Mr
Palmer against Mr Belan alone,
I awarded $25,000 plus costs.
<P>

3	I have to say at the time that I made the orders in respect of costs I did
not specifically avert to Pt 52 r 2 which contains
limitations in respect of
the award of costs where certain amounts have been recovered.
<P>

4	Having now considered that part, and specifically the discretion which is
given to me under Pt 52 r 24(4) it seems to me appropriate
that the plaintiffs
in each case should have their costs.  I have in mind the considerations which
are referred to in the judgment
of the President in the matter of <b><i>John
Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Palmer</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 297.</a>  Specifically, I
believe that an important part of the actions by the plaintiffs was the
vindication of their reputation.  The imputations
made against each of them
were serious, and there can be no question that those imputations damaged their
reputations.
<P>

5	Mr Molomby, appearing for the defendants, resists such an order upon a number
of bases.  The first, he says that though there
were questions of law which
raised some difficulties, they could not be characterised as overwhelmingly
difficult.  The facts were
within a fairly narrow compass, and were largely
documentary.  Secondly, he says that there is no reason why vindication of the
reputations
of the plaintiff could not have been obtained from the District
Court.  Finally, he says that the Defamation List within the Supreme
Court was
not utilised by the parties except in respect of the capacity of the
publications to give rise to the imputations.  This
was not a matter where the
parties were squabbling about issues such as particulars, interrogatories and
discovery.
<P>

6	However, notwithstanding these arguments, it seems to me appropriate that the
plaintiffs should have their full costs.  I believe
the questions of law, and
indeed the questions of fact, were of some complexity.  The challenge to the
imputations by the defendants
was an important stage in the proceedings.
Although it is true that the matter may have been then transferred to the
District Court,
it seems to me  appropriate, in the circumstances, that it
should have remained in the Supreme Court.
<P>

7	I therefore make an order under Pt 52 r 24(4) that the plaintiff should have
full costs in respect of each action.
<P>

8	There is a second application which is made on behalf of the plaintiffs.  On
23 December 1998 offers of compromise were made in
respect of each action.  In
respect of matter number 20115/95 the plaintiff offered to settle the
proceedings for $20,000 plus costs
up to the date of settlement, on a party and
party basis.  The offer was expressed to be open for 28 days.
<P>

9	In respect of each of the remaining actions relating to the publication,
which was known as Exhibit C in the proceedings, the
plaintiffs offered to
compromise their actions for $15,000 plus costs on a party and party basis in
each case.  Again these offers
were expressed to be open for 28 days.  That 28
days, with the addition of the Christmas vacation, would extend to 29 January
1999.
<P>

10	The court is given power to award indemnity costs, through the use of the
offer of compromise procedure, and the failure by the
unsuccessful party to
take advantage of such an offer, where the ultimate verdict exceeds that offer.
That facility has been included
in the rules in order to encourage the early
compromise of actions, and to ensure that parties realistically approach the
forthcoming
litigation.
<P>

11	Mr Molomby, on behalf of the defendants, says that in the particular
circumstances of this case it would be unfair to award indemnity
costs, even
though the plaintiffs recovered in each case more (and indeed, in two cases,
substantially more) than the offers of compromise.
 It is submitted that after
the service of the offers of compromise the plaintiffs materially changed their
cases.
<P>

12	Correspondence, which has been placed before me, was sent to the defendant's
solicitors identifying certain documents which would
be relied upon as an
indication of malice. However, in respect of the documents which were sent to
the defendant's solicitors, accompanying
the letter of 29 January 1999, they
had no real prominence in the litigation, and no prominence at all in my
findings in respect
of malice.
<P>

13	However, on 1 February 1999 the plaintiffs did identify a matter which
ultimately was included as a particular of malice, and
was found by me to be
evidence of malice on the part of Mr Belan.  That is they identified the
incident which occurred on 12 March
1993 relating to a silver bullet.
Examining the particulars of malice, as found by me, this is but one of nine
such matters.  It
is certainly not the most important.  It was a colourful
incident, which was certainly some evidence of Mr Belan's feelings towards
Mr
Boner, but there were many other matters which seemed to me far more important.
In the scheme of things, I do not regard the plaintiff's
case as materially
changing by reason of its inclusion.
<P>

14	For these reasons it seems to me that the ordinary rule should apply, and
that the plaintiffs in each case should have indemnity
costs.  Obviously the
matter proceeded before me as  a joint trial, so that the costs which would be
payable in respect of that trial
would be shared between the three actions
rather than be trebled.  Subject to that, I believe it is appropriate in this
case that
the plaintiffs should have indemnity costs.
<P>

<u>ORDERS</u>
<P>

1.	Pursuant to Pt 52 r 24(4), the plaintiffs should have full costs in respect
of each action.
<P>

2.	Pursuant to Pt 52 r 17(4), such costs should be payable upon an indemnity
basis from 23 December 1998.  The costs payable prior
to that date are to be
assessed on a party and party basis.
