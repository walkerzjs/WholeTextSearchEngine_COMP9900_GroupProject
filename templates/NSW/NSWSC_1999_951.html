THURSDAY 16 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>(On application for discharge of jury or adjournment of trial</b>
<P>

<b>- see p.473 of the transcript)</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This application has been extremely finely balanced,
but I have come to a firm view as to its fate.  I am minded
to grant the
adjournment insofar as it should be necessary, but to have in mind that it will
be necessary to minimise the effects
on the trial that will thereby be created,
lest there should be, in the future, a necessity for a discharge to ensure fair
treatment
for the accused.
<P>

2  	This is a trial of an accused on three counts of murder;  that
is, the murder of his wife and two children.  The offence alleged
against him
is one of considerable heinousness.  Both parties are of the view that the
testimony of a witness, So Young Hwang, who
on the Crown case was, during the
relevant period, the accused's mistress, who left Australia with him and who
had contact with the
accused's wife shortly prior to that woman's
disappearance, is desirable at the trial.
<P>

3  	I had already ruled that her testimony could not, appropriately,
be given by audiovisual link, bearing in mind that she would
have been giving
evidence from South Korea and she would not have been under a sanction, at
least the legal effects of a sanction,
arising as would have been the case had
she been giving evidence here as a consequence of taking the oath and the
application of
the relevant portion of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.  I did that because it
seemed to me that there would be, and indeed this has been confirmed, a
substantial challenge to aspects
of her evidence and that that challenge would
not be limited to ordinary attacks upon credibility, but might well include a
challenge
upon the basis of her involvement in serious criminality and possible
criminality of the order of that charged against the accused,
at least in some
degree of complicity.
<P>

4  	Further, the witness having an immunity, may have an end of her
own to serve and there may be other matters which go to unreliability,
such
that had she been giving evidence by video link, it is possible a jury might
not have been able to appreciate the matters notwithstanding
an appropriate
direction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s165.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.165</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.
<P>

5  	The witness' evidence I need not recount for the purposes of this
application and, indeed, it has hardly been referred to by
either party.  But,
that evidence is certainly most important to the Crown case.  Whilst it is not
direct evidence of the commission
by the accused of the offence charged, it
does go to prove important circumstances which, should the evidence be given
and accepted,
would, when taken in conjunction with other circumstances
otherwise proved, considerably strengthen the Crown case.
<P>

6  	On the other hand, it may well be that the defence would have
available from this witness evidence which would tend to displace
the
hypothesis that the accused committed the crime.  She is peculiarly close to
the action, to use the vernacular.
<P>

7  	In the interests of justice, particularly considering an offence
as serious as this, and a circumstantial case, I would not
see it as
appropriate, if it could be done while ensuring a fair trial, that her evidence
would be effectively excluded.
<P>

8  	Mr. Temby, however, who appears for the accused, has pointed out
that this trial is already fragmented. He has not resiled from
what was put
earlier, that the testimony was desired, but has adopted a position that, on
balance, the fragmentation that has occurred
and will occur to the trial by
reason of meeting the convenience of the witness when coming to Australia, she
not being capable of
being compelled to come or to come any earlier than she
has indicated, is such that there would remain a real question of the jury
being unable to appreciate, at the end of the trial, the significance of
matters which have been given earlier and properly to appreciate
and apply
their recollections by that time.
<P>

9  	It is true the trial will be fragmented.  It may be that events
may occur in the future of the trial which might occasion a
further application
and which application, bearing in mind the increasing frailty of this trial as
a consequence of the fragmentation
I have referred to, might have to be acceded
to.  I know not.  But, the Crown has pointed out that that fragmentation does
not mean
that the jury cannot properly appreciate what has gone on, that much
of the evidence is uncontroversial, that of that portion of
the evidence where
credibility is particularly at issue, that is the testimony of Mr. Paul Lowe
and Mina Park, steps may be able
to be taken to minimise the damage.
<P>

10  	I interpolate that this application has been made midway through
the hearing of an application by the Crown at what would otherwise
be the close
of Mrs. Park's evidence in chief for leave to cross-examine pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>. That application may need some time yet by way of hearing
before I can conclude it.
<P>

11  	The proceedings, as I have said, are fragmented. The issues,
however, are of great and dramatic importance.  In the upshot,
taking into
account the undertakings offered by the Crown, they being, firstly, an
undertaking to meet the loses that might be occasioned
by costs thrown away to
enable the accused to retain his existing representation, at the rate of
remuneration or at least at a reasonable
rate of remuneration if that rate is
not reasonable, and to assist with such Commonwealth departments as might be
necessary to obtain
relevant documentation, it seems to me that the matter has
come down then really to the issue of whether the jury can or cannot continue
with the trial in such a fashion as to be able to afford both parties
justice.
<P>

12  	On what I have seen so far, and on what I have heard in this
application, I am not of the view that the trial, as it  stands,
would be
unfair.  Whether that view will change can only depend upon what happens from
here on in.
<P>

13  	For the moment, the Crown is prepared to undertake steps to seek
to minimise such prejudice to the accused as might arise through
isolation of
the relevant witness from other evidence and to seek to space the evidence in
some such fashion that, as the Crown referred
to it, a buffer be created around
that witness.
<P>

14  	There may be other steps the Crown might take.  There may be
other steps the defence might seek that the Crown takes.  I know
not.  But, the
evidence is evidence which seems to me on balance in the interests of justice
should not be excluded by what amounts
to a listing arrangement, what seems to
have been some degree of ineptitude in the prosecuting authorities securing the
testimony
at an earlier date and some unwillingness of the witness occasioned
possibly by influence from her family or, alternatively, by other
causes, which
are not made clear.  These matters should not, even taken in conjunction,
result in the exclusion of what seems to
be vital evidence.
<P>

15  	The steps that the Crown might take to minimise prejudice are
essentially a matter for the Crown in the running of its case.
 But it will, in
the running of its case, need to have regard to the fact that if prejudice is
occasioned, or the jury seems unable
to follow and perform the function fairly
that it is required to perform, it runs the risk of a future application of a
different
kind being successful.
