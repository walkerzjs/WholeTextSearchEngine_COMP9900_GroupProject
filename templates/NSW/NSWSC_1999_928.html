ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Outline</b>
<P>

1   	This is an appeal from a decision of Master McLaughlin.
The plaintiffs are shareholders in Nobule Pty. Limited (Nobule) and
brought
proceedings for oppression under s320(2) of the Companies (New South Wales)
Code seeking an order that the company be wound
up or that the other
shareholders purchase their shares.  The proceedings commenced by summons filed
on 30 June 1989.  On 4 October
1991 an order was made that the action
proceeding on pleadings.  On 7 February 1994 consent orders were made as
follows:
<P>

1.  	Order that the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants  purchase the
plaintiffs' shares in Nobule Pty Ltd on  the basis that each
of the plaintiffs
held a one  sixth shareholding in that company at a value  (determined on that
basis) and date to be determined
 by a Master (or referee as hereinafter
provided).
<P>

2.	Order that the balance of the proceedings be  referred to a Master (or, if
the parties agree a  referee appointed pursuant to
Part 72 of the Supreme
Court Rules) to enquire into and determine a fair  value of the plaintiffs' two
shares at 16 July,  1986,
30 June, 1989 or such other date as may be  notified
by either party, whichever the Master (or  referee as the case may be)
considers
appropriate.
<P>

...
<P>

4.	Proceedings against the second and third defendants  be otherwise dismissed
with no order as to costs.
<P>

5.	The Master shall be entitled in determining a fair value of the plaintiffs'
shares to take into account any conduct, act or omission
of any of the parties
as pleaded which in his opinion comes within the meaning of section 320(2)(a)
or (b) of the Companies (NSW)
Code.
<P>

6.	Note that apart from the issue of 24,000 shares pleaded in paragraph 21 of
the Statement of Claim, the defendants do not admit
any act or omission or
conduct which was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly
discriminatory against the plaintiffs
or that was contrary to the interests of
the members as a whole.
<P>

2   	An inquiry was conducted by Master McLaughlin.  He decided
that the appropriate valuation date was 16 July 1986 which was the
date the
plaintiffs were removed as directors.  More significantly, however, the Master
decided that the shares had no value as the
company had no value at that date.
The plaintiffs have appealed against that decision.
<P>

3   	If ever there were an action which was unfortunate then
this must be it.  The inquiry before the Master occupied twenty one
days spread
over various times in 1996.  Voluminous written submissions were filed in
November and December 1996 and January 1997
and judgment was finally delivered
on 11 December 1997.  Prior to the inquiry even being commenced, there appear
to have been twenty-eight
occasions when the action was listed before the
Registrar and a further five or even more occasions when it was listed before a
Judge
or a Master.  On any basis the shares in the company were not of great
value.  The figure contended for by the plaintiffs as to the
value of all
shares in the company was $231,516.  On that basis each plaintiff would have
received $38,586.  That is the figure they
continue to seek.  Without
endeavouring to lay or apportion blame, it is obvious there must have been some
failure to consider what
might be described as the proportionality between the
claim and cost of putting it forward.  The difficulty was I think caused by
trying to do too much at the one time, namely to establish oppressive action
and work out a valuation at the same time.  Experts
cannot value shares in a
company without having figures on which to work.  On any basis as the
plaintiffs wished to establish the
published accounts were incorrect yet they
did not know for what figures they contended.  They needed to establish the
latter before
any sensible figure could be put forward as the share value.
That put forward by Mr Fehon was really just a guess.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

4   	The facts giving rise to action can be shortly stated.  Mr
Ledesma was a shoemaker who came to Australia in 1972.  He traded
under the
name of Gaucho Shoes.  Mr Robert Zagame Senior was a shoe retailer with shops
at Lakemba and Cabramatta, trading under
the name of Boulevarde Shoe Stores.
He and Mr Ledesma decided to go into business together with Mr Ledesma making
the shoes and Mr
Zagame selling them.  In 1982, Nobule was formed in which Mr
&amp; Mrs Ledesma each held one share and Boulevarde Pty. Limited held
two
shares.  In 1985 the two sons of Mr Robert Zagame, namely Phillip and Robert
Junior, were appointed directors of Nobule and each
allotted one share.  I will
refer to Mr Robert Zagame (Snr) as Mr Zagame and the sons as Phillip and
Robert.  Towards the end of
that year problems arose between Mr Ledesma and Mr
Zagame.  Mr Ledesma was injured at work in May 1986.  On 16 July 1986 the
Zagame
interests purported to hold a general meeting of Nobule removing Mr
&amp; Mrs Ledesma as directors and increasing the share capital
to $24,000, or
perhaps by $24,000.  On 18 November 1986 allotments of shares were made of
6,000 to each of Phillip and Robert and
12,000 to Boulevarde Shoe Stores Pty.
Limited (Boulevarde).  
<P>

5   	These proceedings were commenced, as I have said, by
summons filed on 30 June 1989, seeking the winding up of Nobule or a compulsory
buy-out order.  
<P>

6   	In coming to his determination the shares had no value, the
Master determined that 16 July 1986 was the appropriate valuation
date and
accepted the valuation of Mr Bryant, with one agreed change which made no real
difference to the conclusion.  This meant
that he accepted the company must be
valued on a net assets basis, the valuation being based upon the assets and
liabilities of Nobule
at 30 June 1986.  It was accepted that there was no
difference between that date and 16 July 1986.  There could be no appeal
against
the decision of the Master if the figures upon which the valuation was
based were proper figures.  The parties accept that the appropriate
date was 16
July 1986 and there is no appeal about that.
<P>

7   	The case of the appellants before the Master was that the
accounts of Nobule did not reveal the true assets and liabilities
of the
company or the true profits of the business.  There were three grounds put
forward for this claim for inaccuracy.  They were:
 (a) that sales of shoes of
Nobule to Boulevarde were not recorded or paid for; (b) the closing stock was
understated; (c) that loans
shown in the books, from Boulevarde to Nobule, were
not bona fide loans but (at least for the most part) represented payment for
shoes purchased by Boulevarde from Nobule.
<P>

8   	As this was the claim of the appellants the onus was on
them to establish it.  However, from then on confusion seems to have
reigned
supreme.  That may have been because, while the plaintiffs had stated on
directions hearings that they did not allege fraud,
on the hearing before the
Master they clearly did so, the evidence of their expert going to this.  The
Master allowed the evidence
in (a lot of it going to matters after July 1986),
granting the appropriate adjournments to deal with it when necessary.  It is in
any event necessary to point out that paragraph 23 of the statement of claim
which was the general claim for oppressive conduct gave
particulars of this
alleged conduct which included claims of exclusion from the business, and more
significantly, included claims
of sale of goods to Boulevarde at an undervalue,
of sales to Boulevard for cash not accounted for (whatever that might mean), of
sales not properly reported, and that records and financial statements did not
truly reflect the financial affairs of the company.
 These were, of course,
rather general claims which had to be made out, but they were the conduct acts
or omissions referred to in
Order 5 of the consent orders of 7 February 1994,
which I have set out.  It is obvious enough the intention of order 5 was that
if
oppression was proved, the shares were to be valued at their value had the
oppression not taken place.  It seems that the allegation
of fraud was
withdrawn towards the end of the hearing and the word "oppression" used
instead, based on the same factual allegations.
 As far as I can ascertain this
made no difference to the decision and I do not understand how it could have.

<P>

9   	The inquiry before the Master was to determine the value of
the shares.  To do that it was necessary to have evidence of the
assets and
liabilities of the company and its profits or losses over a period.  There was
no order that the defendants be the accounting
parties.  The appellants
therefore had to show what those assets and liabilities and profits and losses
were, or perhaps to show
how those differed from the published figures and to
show the value of the shares which flowed from that.  In other words they had
to establish the oppression and then establish what the shares would have been
worth had it not been for the oppression.  Considerable
time seems to have been
spent before the Master, and considerable time was spent before me, in
discussion of what was needed to establish
the plaintiffs' case of fraud or
oppression.  It is perfectly clear the Master understood the requirements as is
shown from the following
passage from his judgment under the heading of "Legal
Principles", although the strictures about pleading may not have been necessary
as it was clear enough what was alleged, at least in general terms.  However,
the references may have been in response to continued
complaints by counsel for
the defendant.  The Master said:
<P>

<b>Legal Principles</b>
<P>

...
<P>

It will be appreciated that the plaintiffs by their statement of claim advanced
what can compendiously be described as an oppression
suit against the
defendants other than Nobule, concerning the conduct and affairs of that
company. It is in the context of that oppression
suit that the valuation of the
shares in Nobule has been calculated by the plaintiffs. It is basic to the
valuation advanced by the
plaintiffs that they can establish the oppression
suit alleged in the statement of claim.
<P>

In regard to that oppression, it will be recalled that by O5 of the consent
orders made on 7 February, 1994, I was specifically
authorised, in performing
the valuation, to take into account any conduct, act or omission of any of the
parties as pleaded which
in my opinion comes within the meaning of s320(2)(a)
or s320(2)(b) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code. That subsection
provides,
relevantly,
<P>

If the Court is of opinion -- 
<P>

(a) 	that affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner oppressive to
one or more of the members; or
<P>

(b) 	that directors of a company have acted in affairs of the company in their
own interests rather than in the interests of the
members as a whole, or in any
other manner whatsoever that is unfair or unjust to other members, ...
<P>

I was taken to a number of authorities relevant to the foregoing statutory
provision, or relevant to what might be described as
oppression in a somewhat
broader sense. Those authorities included Scottish Co-operative Wholesale
Society Ltd v Meyer  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%20AC%20324" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959] AC 324</a>; Re Golden Bread Pty Ltd, The Queensland
Co-Operative Milling Association v Hutchison  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20Qd%20R%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] Qd R 44</a>; Re Bagot Well
Pastoral Company Pty Ltd; Shannon v Reid  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%209%20ACSR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 9 ACSR 129 (Cox</a> J);  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2012%20ACSR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 12
ACSR 197 (Full</a> Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia).
<P>

The various acts of oppression raised in the statement of claim included the
following
<P>

1. 	Phillip and Robert Zagame were each allotted shares in Nobule without
consideration (para13)
<P>

2. 	Mr Ledesma's authority as manager was reduced: in that he was
<P>

(a) 	prohibited access to certain parts of Nobule's premises;
<P>

(b) 	prohibited access to certain parts of Nobule's cheque books and other
books of account;
<P>

(c) 	refused access to Nobule's books of account and other records of its
dealings with Boulevarde;  (para14).
<P>

3. 	Mr Ledesma's employment was terminated (para15) <i>(this was an error.  The
paragraph referred to Mrs Ledesma)</i>.
<P>

4. 	The plaintiffs were given only two days' notice of an extraordinary general
meeting (para16, para17, and para18).
<P>

5. 	Since 16 July, 1986 the plaintiffs have been excluded from the business of
Nobule (para20).
<P>

(a) 	Nobule has sold goods to Boulevards for less then their true market
value.
<P>

(b) 	The second to sixth defendants have sold goods to Nobule for cash and have
not properly accounted for them.
<P>

(c) 	The sales of goods from Nobule to Boulevards have not been reported or
accurately been reported.
<P>

(d) 	The financial records and statements of Nobule do not truly and accurately
reflect its financial affairs.  (para23)
<P>

The share issue was conceded as an act of oppression by the defendants (see O6
made by consent on 7 February, 1994).
<P>

The evidence in the present enquiry, and, in particular, the evidence of the
expert witnesses adduced on behalf of the plaintiffs
and of the defendants can
be properly considered only in the context of the allegations made by the
plaintiffs concerning the conduct
of the defendants in relation to Nobule.
<P>

The substance of the complaint by the plaintiffs concerning oppression was that
the plaintiffs had been locked out of the business
of Nobule. By implication
that locking out also gave rise to the assertions on the part of the plaintiffs
that stock from Nobule
had been transferred to Boulevarde without Nobule
receiving any payment for such undocumented transfers, and that alleged loans
by
the Zagames to Nobule were not genuine or bona fide transactions; with the
consequence that such conduct constituted fraud perpetrated
by the Zagarnes
upon Mr and Mrs Ledesma.
<P>

It will be appreciated, firstly, that the burden of establishing the various
matters asserted by the plaintiffs to constitute oppression
against them by the
defendants, and, in particular, to constitute the various instances of fraud
which they allege, lies upon the
plaintiffs.
<P>

Further, that fraud is a most serious matter. No allegation of fraud should
ever be made unless the party alleging fraud is satisfied
that it has a proper
basis for the allegation (Ghazal v Government Insurance Office of New South
Wales  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 336</a> at 347-349 per Mahoney JA (with whom in this regard
Clarke JA expressly agreed); see Ritchie, Supreme Court Procedure, [15.13.5],
and cases there cited).
<P>

The Court wi1 not find fraud unless it has been properly pleaded. An allegation
of fraud must be pleaded with both specificity and
particularity (Banque
Commerciale SA v Akhil Holdings  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 279</a> at 285 per Mason CJ and
Gaudron J; Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 691</a> at 700).
This attitude of the Court to an allegation of fraud is reflected in the
requirements of the Supreme Court Rules that fraud
must be specifically pleaded
(Pt15 r13), and that particulars of any fraud must be given by the party
alleging the fraud (Pt16 r2).
<P>

Not only must the party alleging fraud plead it with particularity, but it also
necessary for that party to establish the alleged
fraud with clarity (Admont
Holdings v Lowe (Court of Appeal, 17 October, 1989, unreported).) The party
alleging fraud must establish
that fraud on the civil standard of proof, but
the strength of the evidence required to meet that standard is commensurate
with the
gravity of the allegation (Briginshaw v Briginshaw <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336</a>;

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s140.html" class="autolink_findacts">s140(2)).</a>
<P>

The evidence advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs and the manner in which the
case for the plaintiffs was presented clearly constituted
a hearing in the
nature of an oppression suit grounded upon assertions of fraud perpetrated by
the defendants against the plaintiffs.
<P>

Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the evidence, the plaintiffs, in the
submissions of Counsel, attempted largely to withdraw from
allegations of
fraud, whilst still relying upon instances of oppression.
<P>

However, the expert evidence of Mr Fehon presented on behalf of the plaintiffs,
upon which the plaintiffs relied as the basis of
their calculation of the value
of the shares in Nobule, was that fraud had been perpetrated by the Zagames
against the Ledesmas.
<P>

Where, as here, the valuation asserted by the plaintiffs depends upon findings
that the plaintiffs had been the subject of oppression
of the nature which I
have earlier herein described, and that acts of fraud had been perpetrated
against them, it is for the plaintiffs
to establish that conduct and those acts
of fraud. It is not for the defendants to disprove such alleged conduct or such
alleged
acts for fraud. If the plaintiffs can not positively establish the
factual basis upon which Mr Fehon reached his conclusions as to
the value of
the shares, then the Court is not justified in accepting the value advanced by
the plaintiffs.
<P>

It is not sufficient that the Court may entertain some suspicions in the
matter. It is essential that the Court be satisfied on
the balance of
probabilities of the allegations made by the plaintiffs. Otherwise the Court is
not entitled to accept the valuations
grounded upon those allegations.
<P>

10   	There can be no complaint about this passage.  The fact
that Mr Ledesma was locked out - and the Master found that he was
not until
July 1996 - does not seem to have any bearing on the share valuation unless
stock was shown to have been removed in his
absence.  The only relevance it had
was that the plaintiffs' expert concluded that the 1986 figures should not be
used in the valuation
because Mr Ledesma had been excluded.  The exclusion was
however dealt with as a separate ground of oppression and obviously took
some
time.  The written submissions of both sides concentrate on fraud and
oppression, both making emotional and perjurative comments
which do little to
assist the outcome.  The defendants, naturally enough I suppose, have not filed
any cross appeal.  It is too late
for them to complain about pleading
defects.
<P>

11   	The Master's decision depended upon his finding on the
claims of the plaintiff that sales were not accounted for, that liabilities
in
the loan account of Boulevarde were not bona fide and the closing stock was
understated.  The Master found that the plaintiffs
had not made out any of
these claims.   He also found that the claim of exclusion from the business was
not made out.  There is no
appeal from that finding.  As the plaintiffs'
expert's valuation on a capitalisation of profits basis depended on that
allegation
being made out to exclude the 1996 figures, his valuation would have
to fall to the ground in any event.  The grounds of appeal are
framed in a way
which tends to indicate the reversal of the onus for grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6, but
that is not significant.  I will
set out the grounds of appeal as this may help
in the further understanding.
<P>

5.	The Master erred in finding (as the Master apparently did) that the
financial statements of Nobule Pty Ltd from 1983 to 1990
accurately reflected
its financial affairs over that period.
<P>

6.	The Master erred in finding (as the Master apparently did) that all loans
made by Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd to Nobule Pty
Ltd from 1983 to 1990 were
legitimate loans and not payments for stock.
<P>

7.	The Master failed to consider or give any weight to the evidence that the
stock transactions and loan transactions between the
companies were not put
before a general meeting or disclosed to all the members of Nobule Pty Ltd.
<P>

8.	The Master erred in failing to draw any adverse inference against the
defendants from the fact that invoice books which recorded
the sales by Nobule
Pty Ltd to Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd were lost or otherwise not available
to the Court.
<P>

9.	The Master, in reaching his conclusions, failed to consider or give any
weight to evidence that:
<P>

(a)	separate invoice books were kept in relation to the sales made by Nobule
Pty Ltd to Boulevard Shoe Store Pty Ltd;
<P>

(b)	most of the invoice books which recorded sales by Nobule Pty Ltd to the
Boulevard Shoe Store were "lost";
<P>

(c)	in the year ended 30 June 1984 Nobule Pty Ltd's sales as shown on its tax
return are $25,916.52 less than the total of invoices
issued in that year, an
understatement of sales of 15%;
<P>

(d)	in the year ended 30 June 1987 Nobule Pty Ltd's sales as shown on its tax
return are $17,469.23 less than the total of invoices
issued in that year, an
understatement of sales of 16%;
<P>

(e)	in the year ended 30 June 1989 Nobule Pty Ltd's sales as shown on its tax
return are $28,033.20 less than the total of invoices
issued in that year, an
understatement of sales of 14%;
<P>

(f)	the sales by Nobule Pty Ltd to Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd recorded in
the books of the companies, both in actual and percentage
terms, fluctuated
wildly from year to year.
<P>

10.	The Master failed to consider or give any weight to the conflict between
the evidence of Phillip Zagame that:-
<P>

(a)	as production increased over the years, more shoes were taken every year by
Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd; and
<P>

(b)	there were no wild fluctuations in the proportion of Nobule Pty Ltd's
production taken by Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd each
year from 1985 to
1990
<P>

	and the objective documentary evidence that the recorded sales of shoes by
Nobule Pty Limited to Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd
between 1983 and 1990
fluctuated between 0.3% and 63% of Nobule Pty Ltd's total sales.
<P>

11.	In light of the evidence, the Master should have found that:-
<P>

(a)	the financial statements of Nobule Pty Ltd from 1983 to 1990 did not
accurately reflect its financial affairs over that period;
<P>

(b)	there were sales made by Nobule Pty Ltd to Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd
from 1983 to 1990 which were not recorded in the books
and records of Nobule
Pty Ltd;
<P>

(c)	Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd did not pay for all shoes it purchased from
Nobule Pty Ltd from 1983 to 1990; and
<P>

(d)	loans made by Boulevarde Shoe Store Pty Ltd to Nobule Pty Ltd from 1983 to
1990 were not legitimate loans but were payments
for stock.
<P>

12.	The Master erred in adopting the methodology and calculations of the
defendants' expert in circumstances where the financial
statements upon which
the methodology and calculations were based did not accurately reflect Nobule
Pty Limited's financial affairs
over the relevant period.
<P>

13.	In the circumstances, the Master should have adopted the methodology and
calculations of the plaintiff's expert, whose valuation
proceeded on
assumptions as to oppression established by the evidence.
<P>

14.	The Master, in coming to his conclusion that the value of the plaintiff's
shares in Nobule Pty Ltd as at 16 July 1986 was nil,
did not have regard to the
uncontradicted evidence that in July 1986 Robert Zagame (Snr) offered to
purchase the plaintiffs' shares
in Nobule Pty Ltd for $30,000.00.
<P>

Of these ground 7 can be disregarded and ground 14 does not carry the matter
any further, the offer not being accepted and it being
clearly an offer made to
get rid of the plaintiffs from the company.  It will also be appreciated that
many grounds extend to factual
matters beyond 16 July 1986, which could not be
relevant unless they went to show a continuing course of oppression from which
an
inference of past oppression could somehow be drawn.  The case put forward
on appeal was that the Master erred in his findings on
the matters I have set
out in paragraph 7.
<P>

<b>Loan Accounts</b>
<P>

12   	It is convenient to deal with the allegations about the
loan accounts and the closing stock first.  The balance sheet for
30 June 1986
showed Nobule having liabilities to shareholders of $119,725.19.  Mr Fehon
identified loans totalling $230,759.33 claimed
to have been made presumably
since incorporation by Boulevarde or Zagame interests to Nobule.  Apart from
$20,000 he did not accept
any of these.  He did not accept there was an offset
account so that amounts due for shoes were debited against the loan accounts
and he did not accept the loans as genuine.  He gave various reasons for this,
most of which were no more than matters he thought
raised some suspicions.  In
essence he did not accept the loan account as genuine, because the loans were
not proved to be genuine
and until they were he thought they should be written
out.  In fact the evidence of Mr Ross, accepted by the Master, was that there
was an offsetting account, so that purchases of shoes were debited to the loan
account of Boulevarde with Nobule and that so far
as they were challenged,
advances were made by Boulevarde to Nobule or payments were made on its behalf,
all properly brought to
account by way of book entries.  It is important to
understand that the Master found that Mr Fehon had no credibility whatsoever
as
an expert witness.  There was clearly proper ground for that finding.  Once the
adding back by Mr Fehon of these liabilities he
did not accept is set aside,
then his valuation of the company on the basis of net tangible assets falls to
the ground.  But it does
so even more when his adding in a figure of $30,000
being for goodwill of Gaucho Shoes is set aside, the Master quite rightly
having
rejected that figure or its basis or, more properly, its lack of basis.
The simple fact is that there was no evidence that the loan
accounts were not
genuine, nor was there any evidence which established that adjustments were
made to the loan account, not through
offsetting sales by Nobule to Boulevarde
against Nobule's liability to Boulevarde in that loan account but as a false
recording of
purchase moneys as loans.
<P>

<b>Manipulation of closing stock</b>
<P>

13   	It is not at all clear under what ground of appeal this is
brought, but probably it is thought to be covered by the allegation
of
unrecorded sales by Nobule to Boulevarde.  As will have been seen from the
notice of appeal, many of the matters referred to and
complained about in the
Master's findings relate to the period after 1986 which is really irrelevant in
view of that having been
determined as the valuation date.  Nevertheless
assuming that this claim is still made, it apparently is made on the basis that
if
the closing stock is understated then the profit is less than it otherwise
would be, and the stock not brought to account can be
siphoned off to
unrecorded sales.  The Master dealt with claims of manipulation of closing
stock figures for Boulevarde at 30 June
1991, and Nobule at 30 June 1988.  The
first figure must be irrelevant unless there was said to show some course of
conduct about
manipulation of figures and in any event it related to
Boulevarde's closing figures.  In the same way the 1988 figures were
irrelevant.
 While some careful written submissions were devoted to this to
show what could be achieved for taxation purposes by understating
closing
stock, there is no evidence whatever to support the allegation that
manipulation took place, and the two dates which appear
to have been relied on
were irrelevant to the determination of the question at hand.  The findings of
the Master were open to him.
 Indicators of fraud may lead to evidence of
fraud.  Wild swings in cost of goods produced as against sales do not without
more,
particularly in the way the evidence was adduced, establish fraud.  I
consider the Master was correct.
<P>

<b>Claims that sales are not brought to account</b>
<P>

14   	This is the main claim of the plaintiffs.  To some extent
its strength is reduced after the finding of the existence of the
offset
account and movements in the loan account of Boulevarde to take into account
purchases by Boulevarde.  There were some strange
submissions before the Master
and on appeal as to motive and the attractiveness of unrecorded cash
transactions.  Evidence of motive
is relevant to connect someone with a
particular event, it cannot prove an event occurred, namely the event that
Boulevarde took
shoes which were not brought to account.  What is really being
alleged under this head is that (a) Nobule sold goods to Boulevarde
for less
than their market value; (b) that Boulevarde has taken shoes from Nobule
without payment.  It is not particularly clear
from paragraph 23 of the
statement of claim that this is the real claim, but that is certainly the claim
made before the Master and
before me.  So far as goods being sold at less than
market value is concerned, if that somehow falls within the grounds of appeal
then it is not made out.  The discounts made available to Boulevarde were not
out of kilter with those available to other purchasers.
 There is no evidence
of sales at some unnecessarily low price.  I thus turn to the ground of
unrecorded sales, which as far as I
can see, is no different from an allegation
of stolen stock.
<P>

15   	Mr Fehon in his valuation based on capitalisation of
profits as at 16 July 1996, did not work on the basis of unrecorded profits
arising from unrecorded sales.  All his comments and inferences about
unrecorded sales relate to the value in 1989.  In fact the
appellants in their
notice of appeal seek to have the shares valued as Mr Fehon valued them as at I
July 1986.  While he took an
average of the value he arrived at on a
capitalisation of profits basis and the figure he arrived at on a net assets
valuation, the
former accepted the profit and loss account for 1985.  All of
the evidence of Mr Fehon as to undisclosed sales related to his valuation
at 30
June 1989.  There was affidavit evidence of Mr Ledesma of shoes being taken by
Robert junior and Phillip, sometimes without
notes being left as to this, but
there is no direct evidence that these matters were not brought to account.  In
the long run the
appellant's case before me as to unrecorded sales was based
upon inferences to be drawn from non-production of sales invoice books
and
cross-examination of Phillip.  Grounds of appeal 8, 9 and 10 are relevant.  It
is claimed that Phillip admitted that Boulevarde
took fifty percent of the
shoes manufactured by Nobule over a period from 1982 on.  Although Phillip had
been found by the Master
to be a witness whose evidence was totally unreliable,
the particular passage relied upon by the appellants will have to be set out.
The reason for this is that certain exhibits (P and Q) which contained analyses
said to be significant in indicating sources of potential
wrongdoing in a
company's financial affairs do no more than point out problem areas.  An
indication that there may be something wrong
with company accounts is not
evidence that there is something wrong with those accounts without more.  The
evidence relied upon beginning
at TP 419 is as follows:
<P>

Q:	You became even more interested after 1985 in relation to the sales that
Nobule would make, for example?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	In relation to who it was selling to?
<P>

A:	Not necessarily as long as the sales were achieved.
<P>

Q:	But you certainly knew roughly what sort of number of shoes in dollar terms
it was selling each year to the Boulevard, didn't
you?
<P>

A:	Yep.
<P>

Q:	From that knowledge of both Nobule's operations and the Boulevard's
operations --
<P>

A:	Yes
<P>

Q	-- you would have been able to roughly estimate what proportion of Nobule's
production was being taken by Boulevard each year?
<P>

A:	Yes, I could have.
<P>

Q:	Would it be fair to say that if you just cast your mind back to 1990, that
the Boulevard took a certain percentage of Nobule's
production that year?
<P>

A:	1990, yeah.
<P>

Q:	And in 1989 a similar percentage?
<P>

A:	I don't know about a similar percentage but I would - yeah, could have been
more, could have been less, I don't know.
<P>

Q:	We are not talking about wild fluctuations --
<P>

A:	No.
<P>

Q:	-- are we?
<P>

A:	I don't think so.
<P>

Q:	And similarly, 1988?
<P>

A:	Yeah.
<P>

Q:	1987?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	1986?
<P>

A:	Mmm.
<P>

Q:	And 1985?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	So that during the years, financial years from 1985 through to, say, 1990,
the Boulevard Shoe Store would purchase approximately
a similar percentage of
Nobule's production, is that right?
<P>

A:	It's a bit hard to judge really because there were seasons that you would
buy more and seasons that you would buy less.  If the
goods were selling, you'd
buy more; if they weren't selling, you'd by less.
<P>

Q:	That would account for the fluctuation of 10 percent or more, but not less,
would you expect?
<P>

A:	Oh, could be more, could be more with any manufacturer.
<P>

Q:	Are you able to give us an estimate in your opinion for the financial year,
the year ending 30 June 1995 [sic but mistake for
1985], of the percentage or
proportion of Nobule's production of shoes that was taken by the Boulevard?
<P>

A:	No idea.
<P>

Q:	Would it be 0.1 percent?
<P>

A:	No, it would be more than that.
<P>

Q:	Would it be 99 percent?
<P>

A:	No way.
<P>

Q:	Now you must have some idea, being involved with both companies?
<P>

A:	That was the early days, 85, I really don't know what percentage.
<P>

Q:	Let's try the other end, 1990, for example.  During the year ended 30 June
1990, are you able to give us a rough estimation as
to your opinion of the
percentage of Nobule's production purchased by Boulevard?
<P>

A:	No, I don't know.
<P>

Q:	Would it be 1 percent?
<P>

A:	I really don't know.  It would be more than 1, have to be.
<P>

Q:	Could it be 50 percent?
<P>

A:	I don't think so.
<P>

Q:	Now I will just show you from the bar table a computer print-out?
<P>

A:	Mmm.
<P>

Q:	Which has as its first page a heading, "The Boulevard Shoe Store Proprietary
Limited" and it is dated 11/11/1988.  Have you seen
that bundle of computer
print-outs before?
<P>

A:	Briefly, yes.
<P>

Q:	Are you able to tell the court that this green folder that I am holding that
contains the computer print-out contains the Boulevard
Shoe Store Proprietary
Limited annual trial balances?
<P>

A:	I think it would.
<P>

Q:	Also it's[sic] annual general ledger?
<P>

A:	I think so too.
<P>

Q:	If I was to suggest to you that in the year ended 30 June 1988 that the
Boulevard Shoe Store Proprietary Limited purchased a
total of $102,767.60 work
[sic] of stock from Nobule, would you agree with that?
<P>

A:	In 19?.
<P>

Q:	1988.
<P>

A:	Off the top of my head I can't remember.
<P>

Q:	(Counsel approach.)  I show you page 20 of the computer print-out that I
have earlier held up for you?
<P>

A:	Yeah.
<P>

Q:	You see there that is the annual general ledger of the Boulevard Shoe Store
Proprietary Limited from 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1988?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	Do you see there that there is an entry, 30/6/88?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	And next to that entry is the letter, "J"?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	You understand that to refer to journal?
<P>

A:	Now I do, yeah.
<P>

Q:	You see there next to the number "62" are the words under the heading,
"Nobule Proprietary Limited"?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	"Purchased from Nobule 102,767.50?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	You understand that to mean that in the financial year ending 30 June 1988,
the Boulevard Shoe Store purchased $102,767.50 worth
of stock from Nobule?
<P>

A:	I presume so.
<P>

Q:	If I was to tell you that in 1988 the total sales for the Boulevard Shoe
Store were $205,865, would you agree that Nobule supplied
about 50 percent of
the Boulevard's total sales for that particular financial year?
<P>

A:	Going by that figure, yes.
<P>

Q:	You have no reason to doubt what I have put to you as being correct, do
you?
<P>

A:	Well no, not really.
<P>

Q:	I show you another page from that same bundle of computer print-outs.  You
will see that that page is dated 18/10/91?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	You will see that that is headed, "The Boulevard Shoe Store Proprietary
Limited"?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	"Page 19 annual general ledger"?
<P>

A:	Mmm.
<P>

Q:	You will that purports to be the annual general ledger from 1 July 1989 to
30 June 1990?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	Do you tell this court that the figures contained in this document are
accurate to the best of your knowledge?
<P>

A:	To the best of my knowledge yes.
<P>

Q:	And they are figures upon which you as a director of the company rely?
<P>

A:	Mmm.
<P>

Q:	Now those figures show, do they not, that for the year ended 30 June 1990,
that there were purchases from Nobule of $136,091?
<P>

A:	Yeah, that's what it says.
<P>

Q:	That is true, isn't it?
<P>

A:	I presume it would have to be true.
<P>

Q:	If you can accept from me that the total sales made by Nobule for the year
ended 30 June 1990 was $213,712.60 --
<P>

A:	Mmm.
<P>

Q:	-- do you agree that the Boulevard purchased approximately 63 percent of
Nobule's production in that financial year?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	I am not certain whether when I asked you percentages previously I might
have misplaced the various companies.
<P>

A:	Yeah, Mmm.
<P>

Q:	I will put that again to you.  If you accept that Nobule's total sales for
the year ended 30 June 1988 were $205,865, then do
you accept that the
purchases made by the Boulevard of $102,767.50 comprise roughly 50 percent of
Nobule's production?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	So it is clear, isn't it, that in the years 1988 and 1990 that the Boulevard
Shoe Store was purchasing at least half of Nobule's
annual production?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	That is a situation that had been occurring for some time, wasn't it?
<P>

A:	No.
<P>

Q:	But didn't you tell me before that when I took you back from 1990 through to
1985, you said roughly they purchased the same percentage,
that is the
Boulevard would purchase the same percentage --
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

Q:	-- of Nobule's production each year from 85 through to 1990?
<P>

A:	I said roughly.
<P>

Q:	That's what you said?
<P>

A:	I said roughly.
<P>

Q:	Now you see that it was as high as 63 percent in 1990, wasn't it?
<P>

A:	It was.
<P>

Q:	It was as high as 50 percent in 1988?
<P>

A:	Yes.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff/appellants' case as to sales not paid for or
recorded or stolen stock really depends upon a finding that this
passage
contains an admission by Phillip that from 1985 on, the proportion of shoes
sold by Nobule to Boulevarde in relation to total
sales of Nobule was about 50
percent.  I do not think the passage goes so far.  It does in some way involve
an acceptance of the
figures of 1988, 1989 and 1990 which, according to the
plaintiff, are incorrect as well.  But leaving that aside, this evidence of
a
totally unreliable witness is in no way sufficiently certain to justify the
conclusions the appellants claim from it.
<P>

17   	I have endeavoured to deal with the matters which were
argued by the solicitor for the appellants.  In his careful argument
I think
that he put forward everything that could possibly have been put forward on
behalf of the appellants.  One cannot help being
sympathetic towards them as it
was I think never expected that the result the Master came to would be the
result.  However, it does
seem to me that a lot of the argument put forward
went to matters which might have been relevant had the valuation been required
at the later date; and in fact it should be said that insofar as it relied on
"wild fluctuations" to some extent the argument was
based upon the later
figures of Boulevarde purchases from Nobule as being correct.
<P>

18   	It would, I think, have been possible to dispose of the
appeal in the following way:
<P>

1.	The valuation for which the appellants contended before the Master, and
before me, was that of Mr Fehon.
<P>

2.	On the basis of capitalisation of profits of future maintainable earnings
that valuation was flawed, first because it was based
on one year only; and
second because the basis on which the 1986 figures were disregarded was found
to have no foundation.  On the
basis of valuation by net asset value that
valuation was flawed in its deleting the loan accounts from the balance sheet
liabilities
and including an unestablished figure for goodwill.  It followed
that on any averaging of those two figures was flawed.
<P>

3.	On the basis of the accounts figures these was no fault in the decision of
the Master to accept the evidence of Mr Bryant that
the shares had no value.
In fact I do not think any other conclusion was open to him.
<P>

4.	Exhibits P, Q and R did no more than indicate a possibility of fraud through
"sales" not brought to account.  Without the matters
in those exhibits ever
having been put to the plaintiffs' witnesses or the defendants' witnesses,
other than Mr Ross, they could
not establish the fraud alleged without more.
<P>

5.	While the evidence of lost invoice books and the obvious error in the sales
to Boulevarde for the year ended 30 June 1997, and
the variations in the yearly
sales figures, could give rise to suspicion, the finding of the Master that the
fraud or acts of oppression
claimed in respect of sales or removal of stock
were not established was clearly open to him.
<P>

6.	There is no evidence on which the court could reach a different conclusion
as to value.  In other words the voluminous schedules
put forward in argument
would not enable me to reach some conclusion of my own if I considered both Mr
Fehon and Mr Bryant to be
incorrect and considered that the plaintiffs had
established some oppression.  Any conclusion could only be arrived at by
guesswork.
<P>

19   	In spite of what is said in the preceding paragraph I have
endeavoured to deal with the appellants' argument in more detail.
 There can be
no doubt that there was ground to view the published accounts with suspicion.
However, there is no basis to suggest
the Master did not consider the evidence
properly in arriving at his conclusions.  Schedules provided for argument
cannot become
evidence particularly if the opposing witnesses were given no
opportunity to explain them in cross-examination.  All that could be
said on
the appeal was I think said.
<P>

20   	The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
<P>
