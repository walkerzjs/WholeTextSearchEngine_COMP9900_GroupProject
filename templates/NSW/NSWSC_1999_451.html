<P>

<b>2678/96 VALERIE BERG v VINCENT ALOYSIUS MULLINS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:  </b>These proceedings under the Defacto Relationships
Act were commenced in the Local Court at Penrith on or about 11 June 1996.  On
20
June 1996 the proceedings were transferred to the Supreme Court.  The
plaintiff has filed an amended Statement of Claim in the proceedings
which in
addition to a claim under the Defacto Relationships Act brings a claim against
the defendant based upon a constructive trust
in respect of a property
registered in the defendant's name, known as 5 Rodova Street, Katoomba.  A
Judge of this Court has referred
all matters in the proceedings to a Master for
his determination.  
<P>

2	The parties in this matter are at issue as to whether there was a defacto
relationship and indeed give quite different accounts
of most of the matters in
issue.  There was no child born of the relationship between the plaintiff and
the defendant.
<P>

3	It is useful to note a little of the history before coming to the matter in
more detail.  The plaintiff is 69 years having been
born on 23 July 1929.  She
is a retired Nursing Sister.  In 1968 she first met the defendant.  The
plaintiff was divorced in 1964
and was residing with her two children, Andrew
and Juliet, at Etham Avenue, Darling Point.  The defendant was then residing
with
his mother and two spinster sisters in Double Bay.  According to the
plaintiff a sexual relationship commenced about three months
after they met and
this does not seem to be disputed by defendant.  The defendant was then
employed by the New South Wales Sheriff's
Office at Waverley Court House.  In
1970 the plaintiff became pregnant and miscarried at about 14 weeks.  According
to the plaintiff
the defendant was the father.  In 1971 the plaintiff moved to
New South Head Road, Rose Bay and rented a unit in her name.  
<P>

4	In due course between 1971 and 1973 the defendant's mother died and the unit
at Double Bay was sold.  The plaintiff's children
went to live with their
father and in due course the plaintiff resigned from her employment with the
Red Cross Sydney Blood Bank.
 The parties then travelled by ship on a number of
trips including to North America and Japan.  On return in 1974 the plaintiff
rented
another property at 22 Cooper Street, Double Bay and resumed her
employment with the Red Cross.  The defendant resumed his employment
with the
Sheriff's Office.  The parties apparently maintained separate residences and in
1978 the defendant went to live in a boarding
house in Rose Bay.  In 1984 the
parties either took leave or resigned their employment and travelled again to
Europe for about five
months.  In 1985 the defendant returned to Sydney for an
operation on his foot and the plaintiff remained in London for a period
of
about three months.  However, when the plaintiff returned in April/May 1985 she
took accommodation in a private hotel and the
parties resumed their
relationship but not sharing accommodation together.  On her return the
plaintiff did not return to employment
but obtained a Widow's Pension.  Between
1985 and 1987 the plaintiff received $26,000 from the estate of her mother and
in 1988 the
defendant retired from his employment by first taking a year of his
long service leave on half pay. 
<P>

5	In 1989 or 1990 a property was located which was for sale at 5 Rodova Street,
Katoomba.  The property was purchased in the name
of the defendant in the sum
of $110,000.  It was furnished and the purchase price was paid by the defendant
out of his superannuation
monies.  Both parties moved into Katoomba in February
1990.  In late 1992 there was a further trip by the plaintiff and the defendant
when they travelled to Europe for some months.  Prior to this, during the
winter of 1991, there had been a falling out between the
parties and the
plaintiff moved out from Katoomba for a period she says was about three months.
In September 1992 the defendant made
a will in which he left the whole of his
property to the plaintiff.  In May 1996 the defendant put in hand steps to
arrange for the
sale of the Katoomba property.  Relations between the parties
had deteriorated substantially and on 11 June 1996 the Local Court
at Penrith
made the following orders:-
<P>

	"5. That pending further order, the applicant be declared to have a right of
occupancy in the property situate at and known as
5 Rodova Street, Katoomba.
<P>

	6. That pending further order, the respondent be restrained from selling,
transferring or disposing of the property situate at
and known as 5 Rodova
Street, Katoomba.
<P>

	7.	That pending further order, the respondent be restrained from selling,
transferring or disposing of any furniture or chattels
contained within the
property situate at and known as 5 Rodova Street, Katoomba.
<P>

	8. That pending further order, the respondent be restrained from encumbering
in any way whatsoever the property situate at and
known as 5 Rodova Street,
Katoomba.
<P>

	9. That pending further order, the respondent be restrained from assaulting,
molesting, harassing, threatening or otherwise interfering
with the
applicant.
<P>

	10 That pending further order, the respondent be restrained from disposing of
funds held in the name of Vincent Aloysius Mullins
with Westpac, Sydney Office,
341 George Street, Sydney, BSB 732-000 Account number 51-3125."
<P>

6	Immediately after the making of these orders the defendant vacated the
property and has since lived in the Goulburn area.  The
plaintiff has remained
in the property.
<P>

7	As at June 1986 the only assets of the parties appear to be the property at
Katoomba which the plaintiff estimates has a value
of $180,000 and the
defendant estimates has a value of about $150,000 to $160,000.  There is no
sworn evidence as to value.  There
are items of furniture and personal effects
and a Chrysler motor vehicle which is at present parked in a railway yard at
Moss Vale.
 Each of the parties are on a pension.
<P>

8	In the proceedings before me the plaintiff was represented by counsel and the
defendant appeared in person.  The plaintiff's material
included information
that suggested that the defendant had a severe drinking problems and had on
occasions, during the time the parties
were at Katoomba, consulted a
psychiatrist for some treatment for which he was prescribed an anti-depressant,
Zoloft.  There was
also evidence from the plaintiff suggesting that in the
latter part of the period when the parties lived at Katoomba the defendant
held
out to others that he was a Secret Service operative and appeared to be
deluded.  Certainly in the witness box before me the
defendant maintained that
he had signed the Official Secrets Act and was not able to answer any questions
about that matter.  
<P>

9	The plaintiff's position was that the defendant had appropriate capacity to
act for himself and it appeared to me that this was
so.  In particular the
following became clear to me as the trial proceeded
<P>

10	1.	The defendant adequately understood the concept of a defacto relationship
and was able to articulate and cross examine on
the differences between that
and a relationship of a lesser nature.
<P>

11	2.	The defendant was quite capable of cross examining witnesses, insisting
on correct answers and noting immediately when a witness
was avoiding, for
example, the purport of a question.
<P>

12	3.	The defendant was able to make submissions on the appropriate inferences
to be drawn from documents and put appropriate matters
in support of these
arguments.
<P>

13	4.	When matters were explained to him the defendant could appreciate the
need sometimes to change from the stance he had taken
given that a change might
benefit his case.
<P>

14	5.	The defendant suffered from a hearing defect which at times made the
evidence difficult in that he would not hear an answer
from the plaintiff when
cross examining her.  However, this was not a sufficient disability to cause
concern.
<P>

15	In summary it appears to me that the defendant was quite capable of
understanding the nature of the case, issues involved and
was able to conduct
his defence. 
<P>

16	The principal dispute is of course the question of whether or not the
plaintiff and the defendant were living together as husband
and wife on a bona
fide domestic basis.  That question must be determined in accordance with the
principles recently referred to
by the Court of Appeal in <b>Light v Anderson
&amp; Ors</b> (1992) DFC 95120.  They referred with approval to the decision of
Mr Justice Kearney in <b>Simonis v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2021%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 21
NSWLR 677</a> where his Honour in dealing with the similar expression in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act 1982</a> after reviewing the authorities said at page 685 the
following:- 
<P>

	"I consider that the expression under consideration constitutes a single
composite expression of a comprehensive notion or concept
and therefore has to
be approached by considering the expression as a whole and not in several
parts.      This approach, as adopted
by Powell J, was also the approach
preferred by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Waterford's case (see 106).
I consider that
the factors referred to by Powell J, while not being regarded
as a complete test, serve the purpose adequately in the present case
to
determine the question of eligible person.  The factors indicated by Powell J
are as follows (at 459)): 
<P>

	"1.  The duration of the relationship.
<P>

	2.   The nature and extent of the common residence.
<P>

	3.   Whether or not a sexual relationship existed.
<P>

	4.   The degree of financial interdependence and any   arrangements for
support, between or by the parties.
<P>

	5.   The ownership, use and acquisition of property.
<P>

	6.   The procreation of children.
<P>

	7.   The care and support of children.
<P>

	8.   The performance of household duties.
<P>

	9.   The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support. 
<P>

	10.  Reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship."
<P>

	      
<P>

	His Honour also referred to the support to be gained for this approach from
the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission
concerning de facto
relationships (LRC 36 (1983)).  His Honour quoted the following passage in the
report (at 459):
<P>

	The application of the basic definition to the myriad facets of private
personal relationships between men and women will inevitably
be a matter of
degree and proportion.  The attributes and circumstances of such relationships
differ greatly, ranging from what is
little more than a casual liaison, to a
continuing affectionate companionship, to a long term merging of lives and
resources.  Moreover,
the nature and quality of a particular relationship may
change and develop over time, making it sometimes very difficult to pin-point
a
time when the relationship should assume a new legal significance.  
<P>

	As I understand it, the parties substantially treated Powell J's approach as
being appropriate to the circumstances of the present
case."      
<P>

17	Obviously, the list is not immutable and in particular cases other factors
will have to be considered.  The list is of use and
it is convenient to discuss
many of the incidents of the relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased under the headings set
out above.
<P>

18	Before doing so it is, however, necessary to consider questions of credit in
respect of the plaintiff and the defendant.  The
plaintiff on occasions would
add to her answers to questions in order to advocate her case.  Even when
warned not to do this she
persisted in this behaviour.  Apart from this she
gave her evidence in a fairly straight forward manner.  She had a tendency to
make
generalised statements which on scrutiny turned out to be inaccurate.
Apart from this there is no reason to advance as to why I should
not treat her
as a witness of truth.  The defendant I found not very satisfactory as a
witness.  He also endeavoured to not answer
the questions and advocated his
case.  He appeared to me to be well aware that he was doing so and would stop
every time I directed
him to answer the question.  In a number of respects the
defendant's evidence was substantially contradicted by his own documents.
 For
example, he insisted during evidence that he had used up the last of his
capital between 1992 and 1993 when the parties went
on their last trip to
Europe.  His own bank statements showed that in 1995 and 1996 he still had in
the order of $16,000 in the bank
and he could not satisfactorily explain this
fact.  He initially retreated into refusing to answer questions when this
pointed out.
 Another example was his claim that he was employed by the Federal
Police.  Documentary evidence was tendered to show that his application
to join
had been refused.  At times his response to the plaintiff's allegations was to
counter with wild allegations or raise matters
that suggested an inherent
improbability in some of his problem areas.  One of these was his drinking.  He
freely admitted drinking
up to several litres of wine a day and he gave
evidence that he had been barred from 16 different service clubs in the last
few years.
 He claimed that this was without explanation or reason.  This would
seem to strongly support the suggestion that the defendant did
have a drinking
problem.
<P>

19	Overall I have real reservations about the evidence of the defendant and
ordinarily would prefer that of the plaintiff.
<P>

20	I turn to the different headings to which I have referred above in order to
further discuss the question as to whether or not
a defacto relationship
existed.
<P>

	<b>1. The duration of the relationship</b>
<P>

21	The parties had a relationship from 1968 to 1996.  However, as will appear
from what I subsequently refer to, the nature of the
relationship varied at
different times and the way the parties lived also varied over the years.
Notwithstanding comments of the
defendant to the contrary it seems to me that
the relationship was one where the parties, apart from some periods of breaks
in the
relationship had what might be described as a single relationship
between themselves.  In other words they did not have relationships
with other
parties during the relevant periods.  
<P>

	<b>2. The nature and extent of the common residence.</b>
<P>

<b>	The period from 1968 to 1973.</b>
<P>

22	In 1968, according to the plaintiff, she began associating with the
defendant and this is agreed by the defendant.  At that stage
the plaintiff who
had been divorced in the 1964 was residing with her two children, Andrew then
aged 13 and Julian aged 11, at rented
premises in Etham Avenue, Darling Point.
The defendant was residing with his mother and two spinster sisters in a
property at Double
Bay.  The plaintiff suggests that the defendant stayed
overnight with her most nights of the week.  She concedes his belongings
remained
elsewhere at his mother's home.  In 1971 plaintiff moved to a
3-bedroom duplex at New South Head Road, Rose Bay.  The plaintiff suggests
that
at some stage after moving to Rose Bay the defendant used her son, Andrew's
room, on occasions for his belongings when Andrew
was attending King's School
and was not at home.  At some stage which is not clear on the evidence and
certainly not dealt with by
the plaintiff the defendant moved to a flat at
Double Bay as apparently his mother died and the unit which he and his sisters
occupied
at Double Bay was sold.  By the end of this period the plaintiff's
children had gone to reside with their father.  The plaintiff
at some stage
give up the premises at New South Head Road, Rose Bay, probably before she and
the defendant went on a trip overseas
in 1974.  
<P>

	<b>Period 1974 to 1984</b>
<P>

23	At some time either at the end of 1973 or early 1974 the parties travelled
to Canada by ship and subsequently toured around North
America returning by
ship via Japan to Australia.  In paragraph 15 of her statement the plaintiff
said that "we" returned to Australia
in 1974 and moved to 22 Cooper Street,
Double Bay, renting in her name.  It appears from cross examination that at
this address they
each may have had separate flats in the same building.  It is
this type of inaccuracy which causes me concern with the plaintiff's
evidence.
In any event it is clear that the plaintiff resumed her employment with the Red
Cross after her return from the trip overseas.
 The defendant also resumed his
employment with the Sheriff's Office at Waverley Court House.  In 1978 the
defendant went to live
at a boarding house at Rose Bay.  The plaintiff's
evidence in respect of precisely how much time the parties spent together in
this
period from 1973 to 1984 is quite vague.  She tends to use statements such
as "being inseparable" without giving the detail to enable
me to determine
precisely where people resided during the period.
<P>

24	In 1984 the plaintiff resigned her then job at Royal North Short Hospital
and the defendant took leave from the Sheriff's Office.
 They travelled
together to Europe for five months.  On this occasion, as with previous trips
overseas, they each had their own separate
passports in their own names and
tickets booked in their own names.  However, it is clear that on these trips
both parties shared
accommodation together.
<P>

	<b>Period 1985 to February 1990</b>
<P>

25	At the conclusion of the European trip the defendant returned to Sydney for
an operation on his foot and the plaintiff remained
in London for a further
three months.  At that stage she worked as a companion to Lady Rothschild.  She
returned in April or May
1985 and at this stage the plaintiff says that the
defendant was drinking substantially and she did not want to live with him.
She
says that they resided at different addresses but would see each other
during the day and have meals together.  The plaintiff did
not return to work
but received a pension.  In December 1986 the plaintiff received $26,125.32
from the estate of her late mother.
 In 1987 or maybe 1988 the defendant ceased
work.  He had a year of long service leave on half pay and then retired at the
age of
60.  The plaintiff spoke of travelling around Australia after the
defendant ceased work visiting country towns, looking at properties
with a view
to purchase.  I have no doubt that they shared accommodation and were together
while travelling but over the whole of
this period it seems that each
maintained a separate residence.  In 1989 according to the plaintiff, the
defendant started to exhibit
signs of being suicidal and he was admitted to St
Vincent's hospital for treatment for some time.  Precisely how long he was
there
is a matter of dispute but it was clear he was being treated for some
weeks. 
<P>

	<b>Period February 1990 to 11 June 1996</b>
<P>

26	At the end of 1989 the parties had located a property at Katoomba and it was
purchased for $110,000 by the defendant.  His funds
were used for this purchase
the funds coming from the amount he received on his retirement of $138,590.52.
It seems clear that in
February 1990 the parties moved into this residence
although occupying separate bedrooms.  Thereafter they shared a common
residence
until the defendant left in June 1996 apart from one period of
separation.  This period of separation arose because of a problem
which was
becoming very common of the defendant drinking to excess.  In the winter of
1991 the parties had visited Lithgow by train
and the plaintiff had to go home
by herself at 11 pm on the last train leaving the defendant behind who was in
no condition to travel.
 As she had no key she broke into the house and went to
bed.  This prompted the defendant the next day to cause proceedings to be
brought against the plaintiff for breaking and entering but the proceedings
were dismissed.  As a result of this incident, according
to the plaintiff, she
separated from the defendant for about three months.  The defendant says that
the separation was longer, namely,
27 months.  He could not point to precise
times and there are a number of matters which incline me to the view that the
plaintiff's
evidence ought to be accepted.  These are that by September 1991
the defendant was writing notes to the plaintiff suggesting that
they have a
talk.  In addition in September 1992 the defendant made a will in which he
appointed the plaintiff his sole beneficiary.
 That is quite inconsistent with
the defendant's claim of the period of separation of 27 months.  Accordingly, I
am prepared to accept
the plaintiff's evidence that there was a separation for
three months commencing in the middle of 1991.
<P>

	<b>3. Whether or not a sexual relationship existed.</b>
<P>

27	According to the plaintiff a sexual relationship commenced about three
months after they first met in 1986.  This does not seem
to be denied by the
defendant and it appears that the relationship continued, according  to the
plaintiff, up until 1989.  Apparently,
according to the plaintiff, a
combination of medication that the defendant was on when he was at St Vincents
and the consumption
of alcohol made the defendant impotent.  The defendant
himself in the evidence says that there was a cessation of sexual relations
he
says because of the violent abuse he received from the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff's version, I think, is more likely, and given
the lack of any other
evidence about the type of abuse spoken of by the defendant, I would not accept
his version.  However, sexual
relations stopped prior to the parties moving to
Katoomba.  The defendant concedes that the plaintiff was pregnant in 1970 and
that
the pregnancy was terminated.  The manner of termination is not relevant
but I do note that the defendant does not concede that he
was the father.  I am
prepared to accept the plaintiff on this aspect.
<P>

	<b>4.   The degree of financial interdependence and any arrangements for
support, between or by the parties.</b>
<P>

28	Clearly the parties seem able to accept from the other use of the other's
funds.  For example, the parties used the $26,000 that
she received on
travelling, entertainment and gambling at various clubs which she and the
defendant would attend.  The defendant,
for his part, also used his funds or
some of them on retirement for the purposes of their trip to Europe in 1992.

<P>

29	One of the allegations made by the defendant was that the plaintiff was
merely a boarder at Katoomba.  This was strongly denied
by plaintiff.  No
documentary evidence was tendered on this issue and I am prepared to accept the
plaintiff's version that this was
just a fabrication by the defendant.  
<P>

	<b>5.   The ownership, use and acquisition of property.</b>
<P>

30	There was no jointly owned property.  The only asset of any note, the house
at Katoomba, was purchased in the name of the defendant
using his funds.  The
parties maintained separate bank accounts.  
<P>

	<b>6.   The procreation of children.</b>
<P>

<b>	7.   The care and support of children.</b>
<P>

31	These are not relevant to this matter.  The time when the plaintiff had her
children with her was very early in the relationship
and the evidence did not
address any care that was undertaken by the defendant in regard to those
children.
<P>

	<b>8.   The performance of household duties.</b>
<P>

32	The parties concede that they would share the expenses of meals when they
ate out.  The plaintiff seemed to make the payments
for household expenses for
the time when they were at Katoomba.  The defendant denied this and suggested
that he contributed.  However,
his bank statement during the period 1995 to
1996 showed withdrawals almost exclusively coming from RSL Clubs, Workers'
Clubs and
hotels.  The frequency and amount of these withdrawals at hotels
suggest he spent the money there rather than on food for the household.
<P>

	<b>9.   The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support. </b>
<P>

33	The plaintiff suggested in her affidavit evidence that the defendant made
promises to marry which did not come to fruition. 
When the matter was dealt
with in cross examination a slightly different story emerged.  The plaintiff
said that the defendant did
ask her to marry him but it always seemed to be at
times when she was a bit nervous about getting re-married.  She said there were
other times when she did agree to get married and that she did want to marry
him.  They had made arrangements on two occasions to
be married, once to be at
Honolulu and one at Cooma.  However, the weddings did not eventuate.  Clearly
this indicates some attachment
and consideration of a proposed commitment.  
<P>

34	More important matters to consider on this area are the extent of the
support which the plaintiff gave to the defendant.  I have
mentioned the
problems with the defendant's drinking and it is clear, and I accept the
plaintiff on her evidence, that the drinking
to excess caused problems on many
occasions.  She spoke of it interrupting their trip to England in 1992 and it
seemed to become
worse after their return.  The plaintiff spoke of having to go
to hotels at the request of staff to retrieve the defendant from time
to time
as well as finding him unconscious in the garden.  She would clean him up and
look after him when this occurred.
<P>

35	Another matter which started to arise at Katoomba was the fact that the
defendant appeared to be deluded to the extent that he
suggested that he was a
Secret Service agent.  The plaintiff managed to live with it without difficulty
but there was embarrassment
caused from time to time.
<P>

	<b>10.  Reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship.</b>
<P>

36	There are a number of cards and enveloped which have been tendered where the
parties are referred to as Mr and Mrs Mullins. 
There is no doubt the plaintiff
and the defendant spent time out in public together and were frequently seen by
friends together.
 This is not unnatural in that there was, in any event, a
long standing relationship between them.  There was some evidence from
friends
one of whom spoke of the parties living together in Double Bay as partners.
Others spoke of them appearing to be partners
and a couple.
<P>

	<b>Conclusion on whether there was a bona fide defacto relationship.  </b>
<P>

37	It can be seen from looking at the earlier periods prior to the move to
Katoomba that the relationship between the parties was
such that they did
maintain separate residences although in the early years there seems to have
been a fairly detailed association
between them when the defendant would stay
at the plaintiff's flat many days a week.  There is no doubt that there was a
sexual relationship
in the early years.  The parties when they travelled would
travel together and share the same accommodation.  However, whenever they
did
travel away together when they came home they returned to their separate
residences.  Setting up house together is an important
indication of the
required relationship and this did not happen.  The failure to ever agree on
marriage is perhaps a pointer to the
extent of the depth of the relationship.
It was not as though they were like many other couples nowadays who make a
commitment to
live together in a defacto relationship leaving aside as
irrelevant the bonds of marriage.  
<P>

38	The plaintiff bears the onus of establishing the existence of the
relationship and in respect of the period up until February
1990 I am not
satisfied that the parties lived together on a bona fide domestic basis as man
and wife.  From 1990 onwards it is clear
that the parties shared the same
residence and household.  Accordingly, the situation is quite different.
Although the sexual relationship
had ceased by this stage it does not detract
from the fact that they lived together as a couple for the whole of the period
apart
from the one admitted period of separation in 1991.  The support and
assistance given by the plaintiff to the defendant during this
period with his
troubles with drinking and delusions also strengthens the conclusion that there
was the appropriate relationship.
 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the parties
lived together in a bona fide domestic relationship as man and wife from
February 1990.
 There was a separation for a period of three months in mid 1991
and they lived together again thereafter until June 1996 when the
defendant
left the Katoomba property.
<P>

39	So far as the separation is concerned it was a decision by the plaintiff to
live apart and this means there was a termination
of the relationship.  There
are thus two discreet periods of the relationship one for 16 months and the
other for 4 years and 9 months.
 
<P>

40	Before turning to the property of the parties it is important to consider
whether or not I can have regard to contributions made
prior to the last of
these periods.  Certainly in respect of the period before February 1990 I
cannot have regard to contributions
made at that stage.  In relation to the
period from April 1990 until June 1991 a real problem arises because the
plaintiff has made
no application for leave under s 18 of the Act.  Section 18
is in the following terms:-
<P>

	"(1)  Except as provided by subsections (2) and (3), where de facto partners
have ceased to live together as husband and wife on
a bona fide domestic basis,
an application to a court for an order under this Part shall be made before the
expiration of the period
of two years after the day on which they ceased, or
last ceased, as the case may require, to so live together.       
<P>

	(2)  A court may, at any time after the expiration of the period referred to
in subs (1), grant leave to a de facto partner to
apply to the court for an
order under this Part (other than an order under s 27 (1) made where the court
is satisfied as to the matters
specified in s 27 (1) (b) ).  Where the court is
satisfied, having regard to such matters as it considers relevant, that greater
hardship would be caused to the applicant if that leave were not granted than
would be caused to the respondent if that leave were
granted.       
<P>

	(3)  Where, under subs (2), a court grants a de facto partner leave to apply
to the court for an order under this Part, the de
facto partner may apply
accordingly."
<P>

41	In <b>Fotheringham v Fotheringham </b>(unreported 19 November 1996) I had at
first instance concluded that in a case where there are two discreet defacto
relationships,
provided the application was within two years of the termination
of the last period it was possible, without making application under
s 18, to
take into account the contributions made in the earlier of the two defacto
relationships.  In particular I noted that s
18(1) concluded with the words, "2
years after the day on which they ceased, or last ceased, as the case may
require, to so live
together".  On appeal His Honour Mr Justice Powell ( Court
of Appeal 28 August 1998 unreported) held that this approach was wrong.
 At
pages 20 and 21 of his judgment his Honour held that the applicant for an order
bears the onus of establishing that the condition
precedent in s 18 has been
fulfilled or alternatively bears the onus of obtaining an order of court
granting leave to commence proceedings.
 
<P>

42	Because no application has been made it seems to me that I can not take
account of any contributions made during the earlier
period of the defacto
relationship.  Recently in <b>McKone v Maretta</b>, 12 May 1999, I considered
whether an application for leave in those circumstances can be successful if
the earlier period is less
than two years.  However, that does not arise as no
application under the section has been made.
<P>

	<b>Property of the parties</b>
<P>

43	If one turns to look at the property of the parties in mid 1991 it is clear
that the defendant had property at Katoomba.  He
also had a car the precise
value of which does not appear in the evidence.  Precisely how much cash he had
at this stage after the
purchase of the property does not appear.  It certainly
was in excess of $16,000.  
<P>

44	The plaintiff does not deal with her assets at that time but it would seem
that there was little that she had she probably having
expended her only
inheritance of $26,000 some years earlier.  She was living on the pension as
was the defendant.
<P>

45	At the conclusion of the relationship the defendant still had the home the
value of which was put in evidence by the parties
at between $150,000 and
$180,000.  There were items of furniture and personal effects and the Chrysler
motor vehicle which was in
the defendant's name.  The defendant had an account
with Westpac.  In October 1995 that account stood at $16,893.56.  It slowly
decreased
until by 13 February 1996 it was down to $12,769.  The defendant had
a Bankcard and a Mastercard accounts and by August 1996 the
amounts owed on
these were respectively $4,594.05 and $4,494.44. 
<P>

46	The defendant has conceded in evidence that the amounts owing to the banks
have increased substantially and he seems to concede
that there is an amount of
approximately $30,000 owing to the bank at the present time.  This is important
because the bank has registered
a writ on the title of the property following
upon proceedings in the Local Court.  
<P>

	<b>Contributions</b>
<P>

47	The plaintiff's case contained a number of aspects of contributions which
because of the period of the relationship I have found
can not be taken into
account.  There was first a suggestion that she was supporting the defendant in
the years from 1986 to 1988
when he was building up substantially the amount of
his superannuation.  Clearly he was contributing a great amount to it at that
stage and there may well have been some basis for this claim but, given the
time frame, it is not relevant.  Another one which is
not relevant is the
arrangement for the purchase of Katoomba.  It turned out that the plaintiff
knew the vendors and was able to
negotiate a reduction in price from $120,000
to $110,000.  If it was relevant to consider that as a contribution I would
have accepted
the plaintiff's evidence on this aspect but it is not relevant.

<P>

48	The real contribution in the present case on the plaintiff's part is the way
in which she managed the household of the defendant
for the period of the
relationship.  I am happy to accept the plaintiff's version in which she said
she cooked and cleaned for the
household.  I also accept that she paid for the
food consumed and gave the defendant $55 per week towards the household bills.
Her
story is consistent with what records are available of the defendant
spending his pension and savings. 
<P>

49	Apart from these financial contributions to the running of the household a
more important contribution has been the care which
the plaintiff has given to
the defendant in his difficult years.  These difficulties were caused by the
delusions and the drinking
of the defendant.  It imposed more than the ordinary
obligations on a partner.  The plaintiff spoke of the parties keeping to
themselves.
 Apart from a few friends who gave evidence of seeing them at this
time this may well have been the case.  In my view the difficulties
which the
plaintiff had with the defendant require substantial recognition of her efforts
over the four years and nine months that
the parties lived together.
<P>

50	Before finally determining this matter I will mention one other matter that
arises on the pleadings.  That is that the plaintiff
has claimed that the
defendant held his interest in the Katoomba property on trust for the
plaintiff.  As was made clear in submissions
that claim was based upon the
evidence given in paragraph 26 of the plaintiff's second statement which
paragraph is in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"In about 1989 - 1990, Vincent and I found the property at 5 Rodova Street,
Katoomba.  At the time of the sale of the property
was in good condition and
was for sale for $120,000.
<P>

	The vendor was known to me.  I negotiated the purchase at $110,000 and the
furniture was purchased for an extra $2,500 and the
purchase was completed in
February 1990 using funds from Vincent's superannuation fund.  Annexed hereto
and marked with the letter
"D" is a true copy of a letter from William J.
Player, Solicitor, dated 31 January 1990 in relation to settlement of the
purchase.
<P>

	When we went to the solicitors office to sign the paperwork, we shared some
champagne in anticipation.
<P>

	On arrival at the solicitor's office, I found myself being a witness to
Vincent's signature and not a purchaser.
<P>

	After leaving the solicitors office I recall that I said to Vincent, `Why is
the property not in both of our names?' to which he
replied, `It is better for
taxation purposes to have it in my name.  You know I will always look after
you, Peach'.  Peach was the
nickname used by Vincent in relation to me.  I
relied on this assertion by Vincent from early in our relationship."
<P>

51	It was submitted that there was a common intention that the property would
be a shelter for them both .  The defendant denies
the conversation but even
assuming for the moment that I might find in favour of the plaintiff on this
particular conversation, it
would not support the existence of a constructive
trust.  First there is no mention in the discussion about ownership.  The
expression
used is "You know I will always look after you, Peach".  This is no
more than the equivalent of the acceptance of an obligation on
the part of a
husband to house his wife.  See comments of Gleeson CJ in <b>Green v Green
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 343</a> at 353.  The other matter which is abundantly clear is
that the whole of the funds for the purchase came from defendant.  There has
been no acting by the plaintiff to her detriment in respect of the matter.
<P>

52	Accordingly it seems to me that there is no basis for any claim for a
constructive trust.  
<P>

53	In conclusion the only remedy which the plaintiff can achieve in the present
action is in respect of the claim under the <b>Defacto Relationships Act</b>.
It is clear that the defendant provided the whole of the funds for the purchase
of the property which is now the only remaining
property which can be
considered.  The car, given it is impounded, is probably of little value.
<P>

54	I have to balance of course the contributions the plaintiff has made which I
have identified above and the defendant's provision
of the funds for the
purchase of this property.  Another area of financial contributions by the
defendant was the provision of funds
for the parties trip to England in 1992.
His extravagant claims cannot be accepted.  Using references to the particular
funds identified
it seems likely that the defendant paid for airfares of $3,200
and accommodation and other expenses of $9,000.  On return to Australia
the
plaintiff reimbursed him to the extent of $3,000.  This contribution also has
to be taken into account.
<P>

55	Another matter to be taken into account in the appropriate orders is the
payment out of the debts of the defendant which seem
to have been accrued
towards the end of the relationship and after the relationship finished.  It
seems inevitable that the property
will have to be sold.  Accordingly, I
propose to make orders to give effect to a sale at this stage.  There is an
interlocutory regime
in place which is no longer relevant.  The evidence before
me does not suggest a need for restraining orders once a sale of the property
is completed and the parties are now living well apart.
<P>

56	The orders that I make are as follows:-
<P>

57	1.	Order that the property 5 Rodova Street, Katoomba be sold and that the
proceeds be applied as follows:-
<P>

	(a) A payment of the expenses of sale.
<P>

	(b) A payment of any outstanding rates on the property.
<P>

	(c) That the remaining proceeds be divided in the following  way:-
<P>

	(i) As to 40% for the plaintiff.
<P>

	(ii) As to the balance to be applied to meet any payment due by the defendant
to Westpac Banking Corporation and thereafter the
balance to the defendant.
<P>

2.	Order that in the event the parties do not within three months from the date
hereof agree upon a distribution of the furniture
and effects in the property
at Katoomba that they be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the
parties after the payment
of expenses of sale.
<P>

3.	I discharge the orders made by the Local Court at Penrith on 11 June 1986 in
this matter.
<P>

4.	I order that, pending the sale in paragraph 1, the plaintiff have possession
of 5 Rodova Street, Katoomba and that she vacate
the premises upon its sale.
<P>

5.	I restrain the defendant from entering the premises 5 Rodova Street,
Katoomba except for the purpose of inspecting the furniture
and effects therein
or collecting such furniture and effects as the parties have agreed he shall
retain provided that two clear days'
notice of his desire to enter the premises
shall be given to the plaintiff by the defendant.
<P>

6.	I reserve liberty to either party to apply:-
<P>

	(a) for any further ancillary orders to effectuate the sale referred to in
orders 1 and 2 above;
<P>

	(b) for any injunction under s 53 pending the sale in order 1 above;
<P>

(c) for further enforcement of these orders.
<P>

7.	Order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs.
