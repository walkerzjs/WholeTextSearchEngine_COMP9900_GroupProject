<P>

MONDAY 2 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<b>50113/98	IDOPORT PTY LTD &amp; ANOR v NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANKI LIMITED &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: The hearing of these proceedings has continued over
several days before Einstein J.  On 28 July 1999 defendants'
counsel made a
call for production of some documents.  This call was delivered orally from the
Bar table in the course of the hearing.
 The plaintiff produced documents in
answer on 29 July and of those documents Einstein J set aside documents in two
envelopes marked
"Privileged" as they were subject to claims of client legal
privilege on which his Honour did not rule.
<P>

2  	Einstein J requested me to hear and determine the claim of client
legal privilege.  For some reason which I do not know, and
have no occasion to
know, his Honour did not regard it as appropriate that he should decide the
matter.
<P>

3  	In respect of documents in one envelope marked "Counsel's
Advice", the defendants' counsel has today not pressed me to come
to a
conclusion so that the privilege claim remains undetermined and the documents
will remain in the envelope marked as now marked
unless and until there is some
further ruling.
<P>

4  	The second envelope is marked "Litigation Reports" and contains
four documents.  The first is a letter from Idoport Pty Ltd
to Mr Port, chief
executive of OAMP, dated 1 December 1998.  I have been told today that in
respect of that document there is now
no privilege claimed.  Accordingly, it
may be inspected.
<P>

5  	The second document is a letter from Idoport Pty Ltd to Mr
Lamont, Chairman of OAMPS, in respect of which I have been told today
that the
privilege claimed relates to some passages in the document.  I have been shown
a copy with some passages blanked out, so
the blanking identifies the passages
said to be privileged.
<P>

6  	I propose to proceed to rule on the claim for privilege for the
parts blanked out on the basis of the material before me, i.e.
only the
contents of the documents themselves.
<P>

7  	The third document is a letter from Idoport Pty Ltd to Mr Lamont
dated 5 May 1999 for which there is no privilege claim and
it may now be
inspected.
<P>

8  	The fourth is a report on the NAB claim dated 11 June 1999.  For
this document there is a privilege claim, again for some parts
which are
blanked out, on which I am to rule.
<P>

9  	On reading document number 2 and the corresponding document with
passages blanked out, it is in my opinion clear from the terms
of the passages
blanked out and their content that, in the words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 118</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act
1995</a>, adducing evidence of them, or - I should interpose - producing them for
inspection  by another party in answer to a call, would
result in disclosure of
a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer.  Mr
Maconachie communicated to Mr Lamont
the terms of legal advice or other advice
from lawyers representing him and his companies, and the terms of the material
themselves
indicate that they were confidential in nature and that they related
to the conduct of the proceedings.  Document 2 is not a communication
between
lawyer and client but is protected having regard to the provisions of subs
122(2), because the communication passing between
Mr Maconachie and Mr Lamont
was itself a confidential communication.  That it was a confidential
communication appears from its general
nature, and also by express reference to
confidentiality in the report annexed to the letter.
<P>

10  	In my opinion the privilege claimed for the blanked-out passages
in the copy document 2 should be allowed and inspection of
document 2 should be
restricted.
<P>

11  	Document 3 is in the same position as document 1, i.e. there is
now no claim of privilege.
<P>

12  	Document 4 is in the same position as document 2 and, for
similar reasons as for document 2, it appears on consideration of
the contents
of the document and the passages blanked out that client legal privilege
extends to protect the document against inspection
by another party.
<P>

13  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 118</a> relates to the adduction of evidence.  The events
which have given rise to the question before me arise on a proceeding ancillary
to the adduction of evidence; the claim was made in the course of proceedings
for the production of documents on call.  I have applied
the view expressed in
the judgment of Mason P in <b>Akins &amp; Ors v Abigroup Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/254.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 254</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=43%20NSWLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">43 NSWLR
539</a> at 545 and following, and I have made these rulings on the footing that the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> ought to apply by analogy to privilege
claimed on such a call.  The procedure followed could not be referred to as
pre-trial gathering
of evidence.  Mason P uses that expression in his judgment
to extend to processes ancillary to trials: see 545D.  As I understand
his
Honour, his Honour's ruling is no less applicable to a process for the
production and inspection of documents where the process
happens whilst the
trial is actually proceeding.
<P>

14  	In revising these reasons I add that I have followed the holding
in Akins because it is a binding authority, notwithstanding
that the opposite
view is strongly supported by other decisions, most notably by the decision of
the Court of Criminal Appeal in
R. v. Young  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSW%20CCA%20166" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSW CCA 166.</a>  The binding
effect of decisions is produced by the power to hear appeals: see Viro v The
Queen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20141%20CLR%2088" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 141 CLR 88</a> at 93 (Barwick CJ) 120 (Gibbs J) 129 (Stephen J)
173-174 (Aickin J).  The Court of Criminal Appeal does not have power to hear
an
appeal from my decision in this application.
<P>

15  	I make the following directions: 
<P>

(1)	I direct that each party and the legal representatives of each party may
inspect for the purpose of these proceedings documents
1 and 3 of the documents
produced by the plaintiff before Einstein J on 29 July 1999 in answer to a call
for the production of documents
made on 28 July 1999 and contained in the
envelope marked "Litigation Reports". 
<P>

(2)	I direct that each party and the legal representative of each party may
inspect copies of documents numbers 2 and 4 in the envelope,
being copies which
I have initialled for identification, from which certain passages have been
blanked out.
<P>

(3)	The envelope containing the litigation reports is returned to plaintiff's
counsel who should comply with the direction  by producing
documents for
inspection and should protect the plaintiff's interests as that is done.
<P>

(4)	The envelope marked "Counsel's Advice", on which I have not ruled, will
remain with the papers.
<P>

16  	Today counsel representing the plaintiffs, and also counsel
representing OAMP, sought to embark upon obtaining my ruling by
objecting, on
the basis of client legal privilege and the provisions of subs 122(5)(b)
relating to common interest, to inspection
of documents produced on subpoena by
a number of companies, including OAMP Funds Management Limited, Australian
International Insurances
Limited and Vigil Underwriting Agencies Pty Limited in
response to subpoenas issued by leave of Einstein J granted on 28 July 1999.
The claim for privilege appeared to me to involve a need the ground of the
claim and to establish the claim by evidence, it may be
by affidavit or it may
be by evidence already introduced at the trial before Einstein J, of the
factual basis for the claim.  The
claim for privilege relating to documents
produced on subpoena is not within the range of the matters which Einstein J
referred to
me: it relates to a trial which is proceeding before him.  I do not
think it would be good practice for me to embark upon deciding
such a claim
otherwise than in accordance with the wish of the judge of trial.  In any
event, the claim does not appear to me to
be in a condition where it could be
properly addressed for lack of definition of grounds and establishment of its
factual basis.
 For that reason I have not completed the hearing of the
application or made any ruling upon it.
<P>

17  	Order:
<P>

	(5)	The costs of the application today are reserved for decision by Einstein
J.
