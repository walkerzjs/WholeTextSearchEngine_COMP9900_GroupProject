<P>

<i>Wednesday, 2 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>z</b>
<P>

<b>3402 of 1993	MARK OLIVER DRESLER  -v-  GEORGE MRISH</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed on 30 November
1998 the plaintiff, Mark Oliver Dresler, seeks, substantively, summary judgment
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

2   	The proceedings were instituted by statement of claim filed
by the plaintiff on 29 July 1997. That statement of claim named
three
defendants, George Mrish, Lawhouse Pty Limited, and the Registrar-General. A
submitting appearance has been filed on behalf
of the Registrar-General.
Lawhouse Pty Limited is a company which at all material times was under the
control of the first defendant.
<P>

3   	A defence was filed by the first and second defendants on
28 September 1998. 
<P>

4   	The plaintiff brings the substantive proceedings in his
capacity as administrator with the respective wills annexed of his
parents
Oliver Dresler and Thelma Dresler (each of whom died some time between 11 June
1993 and 19 June 1993) and as administrator
of the intestate estate of John
Herbert Dresler, the brother of the plaintiff and the only other child of their
parents (who died
on or about 29 March 1993). (I shall refer to the late Oliver
Dresler and the late Thelma Dresler as "Mr and Mrs Dresler" and to
the late
John Herbert Dresler as "John Dresler" or "John".)
<P>

5   	In the events which have happened, the plaintiff is
beneficially entitled to the entirety of the estate of each of his parents
and
of his brother. 
<P>

6   	By the proceedings the plaintiff seeks to recover certain
assets belonging to his parents which were allegedly transferred
by them to
either the first defendant or the second defendant and certain payments
allegedly made by his parents to those defendants.
It is the assertion of the
plaintiff that the various transfers and payments were made by reason of the
exercise by the first defendant
of undue influence, threats and blackmail on
the late Mr and Mrs Dresler.
<P>

7   	On 5 October 1996 George Mrish was found guilty by a jury
of the murder of Mr and Mrs Dresler and of John Herbert Dresler.
He was
sentenced to 28 years' imprisonment. On 29 July 1998, whilst in prison, the
first defendant died by his own hand. 
<P>

8   	On 15 December 1998 an order was made that, pursuant to
Part 8 Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules, the proceedings continue
in the
absence of a person representing the estate of the first defendant, and,
further, that any judgment or order subsequently
entered or made in the
proceedings shall bind the estate of the first defendant to the same extent as
the estate would have been
bound had a personal representative of the first
defendant been a party to the proceedings. 
<P>

9   	The first defendant died intestate. He left a widow, Donna
Marie Mrish (to whom I shall refer as "Mrs Mrish") and seven children
(six of
those children were born to the marriage of himself and his wife; the seventh
was an ex-nuptial child). The inventory of
property filed in the application of
his widow for a grant of administration of the first defendant discloses assets
totalling $564,000.
Letters of administration were granted to Mrs Mrish on 7
April 1999. Upon intestacy Mrs Mrish as the widow of the first defendant
is
entitled to $150,000, plus six-thirteenths of residue.
<P>

10   	By notice of motion filed on 12 March 1999 (that being
after the institution of the present application for summary judgment
by the
plaintiff) Mrs Mrish made application that she, as the administrator of the
estate of the first defendant, be substituted
for him in the proceedings, and
that she be allowed to be heard upon the hearing of the present application for
summary judgment.

<P>

11   	As a result of that application an order was made that
Donna Marie Mrish be permitted to represent the interests of the first
defendant, now deceased, in relation to any claim by the plaintiff against the
asset referred to in item 4 of the inventory of property
which is annexure C to
the affidavit of Phillip James Beazley sworn 26 March 1999, but that the
applicant not otherwise be permitted
to participate in the proceedings. Item 4
of the inventory of property is headed "Money in Banks or Financial
Institutions" and the
item itself appears as, "Money held on trust by Hardings,
Solicitors being proceeds of sale of the property known as 73 Adam Street,
Guilford", to which is ascribed an estimated or known value of $140,000.
<P>

12   	When the application for summary judgment (which on 24
February 1999 had been specially fixed to be heard on 8 April 1999)
was called
on for hearing on that latter date a further application was made by Mrs Mrish
(by way of notice of motion filed that
day, 8 April 1999), by which Mrs Mrish
sought, substantively, an order that the hearing fixed for that day be vacated
and an order
that Mrs Mrish be appointed to represent the estate of the first
defendant for the purposes of the present proceedings. 
<P>

13   	It will be appreciated that the second of those
applications, the appointment of Mrs Mrish to represent the estate of the
first
defendant, was an application in substance identical to that which was heard
and determined less than two weeks previously,
on 26 March 1999. 
<P>

14   	The Court on 8 April 1999 refused the application that Mrs
Mrish be permitted to participate generally in the proceedings,
and refused the
application for a vacation of that day's hearing date. However, the Court
ordered that the order made on 26 March
1999 be varied by substituting for the
words "the asset referred to in item 4" the words "the assets referred to in
item 1 (b) and
item 4". Item 1 (b) of the inventory of property appears under
the heading "Real Property" and is described as "property at Orange
being Lot
5, Portion 8 in Deposited Plan 8843 as described in Folio Identifier 5/8/8843
(estimated)" to which is ascribed an estimated
or known value of $150,000.
<P>

15   	The reason for the orders made on 26 March 1999 and 8
April 1999 was that the summary judgment sought by the plaintiff in
the
substantive proceedings will affect those two specific items of property which
are asserted by Mrs Mrish to be assets in the
estate of the first defendant,
and in respect whereof Mrs Mrish and her six infant children, as well as the
ex-nuptial child of the
deceased (who is also an infant) would have an
interest. 
<P>

16   	Mrs Mrish was represented by Solicitor and Counsel at the
hearing of the application for summary judgment. 
<P>

17   	The affidavit evidence relied upon in support of that
application included an affidavit of the plaintiff Mark Oliver Dresler
sworn 7
July 1993, and a further affidavit of the same deponent sworn 6 March 1998. 
<P>

18   	During the course of the hearing Counsel for Mrs Mrish
sought to read the affidavit of George Mrish sworn 20 April 1998. That
application was opposed by the plaintiff. For the reasons set forth in the
separate judgment delivered by me on 8 April 1999 I refused
that application.

<P>

19   	It has already been recorded that the present application
is brought by the plaintiff pursuant to the provisions of Part 13
rule 2 of the
Supreme Court Rules. Subrule (1) of that rule provides,
<P>

Where, on application by the plaintiff in relation to any claim for relief or
any part of any claim for relief of the plaintiff
---
<P>

(a) 	there is evidence of the facts on which the claim or part is based; and

<P>

(b) 	there is evidence given by the plaintiff or by some responsible person
that, in the belief of the person giving the evidence,
the defendant has no
defence to the claim or part, or no defence except as to the amount of any
damages claimed, 
<P>

the Court may, by order, on terms, give such judgment for the plaintiff on that
claim or part as the nature of the case requires.
<P>

20   	The evidence relied upon by the plaintiff as constituting
the facts on which the claim or part is based is substantially the
evidence of
the plaintiff himself contained in his affidavits of 7 July 1993 and 6 March
1998, and the evidence of Dennis John Robertson
set forth in his affidavit of
24 July 1997. 
<P>

21   	The proceedings are grounded upon equitable principles
relating to the existence of constructive trusts, and upon the application
of
the equitable doctrine of tracing. 
<P>

22   	Essentially, it is the case for the plaintiff that between
30 June 1992 and 30 June 1993 the combined assets of Mr and Mrs
Dresler
(including the assets of the Dresler Family Trust) had diminished by at least
$916,654. (The Dresler Family Trust was an
entity of which the late Mr Dresler
was trustee and Mr Dresler and their two sons were nominated beneficiaries; it
was used by the
late Mr Dresler as a vehicle by which certain of his business
affairs were conducted.) Evidence to support that conclusion emerges
from the
report of Mr Robertson, a chartered accountant, (whose report, annexed to his
affidavit of 24 July 1997, performs a tracing
exercise in respect of the assets
formerly held by Mr and Mrs Dresler and assets which subsequently came into the
ownership of the
first defendant). It should here be noted that the expert
evidence of Mr Robertson was objected to on behalf of Mrs Mrish, and was
admitted into evidence over that objection. 
<P>

23   	The evidence as to the overbearing of the wills of Mr and
Mrs Dresler in consequence of undue influence, threats and blackmail
by the
first defendant emerges both expressly and by inference from the affidavits of
the plaintiff. 
<P>

24   	I am satisfied that there is evidence of the facts on
which the claim of the plaintiff is based.
<P>

25   	The evidence relied upon by the plaintiff as fulfilling
the requirement of paragraph (b) of Rule 2 (1) is the affidavit of
Colin James
Skelton, the solicitor for the plaintiff, sworn on 8 April 1999. Paragraph 2 of
that affidavit states,
<P>

Having regard to the instructions given to me by the Plaintiff, the documents
produced to this Court by the Commissioner for Police
and the report and
findings of Dennis John Robertson, it is my belief that the First Defendant has
no defence to the Statement of
Claim filed herein and that the Plaintiff is
entitled to the relief sought.
<P>

26   	The foregoing paragraph of Mr Skelton's affidavit was
objected to on behalf Mrs Mrish, and was admitted into evidence over
that
objection. It was subsequently submitted by Counsel for Mrs Mrish that the
deponent of that affidavit was not adequately qualified
to express the belief
stated in paragraph 2 of that affidavit. However, Counsel subsequently withdrew
that submission. 
<P>

27   	I am satisfied that the affidavit of Mr Skelton of 8 April
1999 complies with the requirement of paragraph (b) of rule 2 (1).

<P>

28   	It becomes necessary, therefore, to proceed to a
consideration of whether the Court should exercise the discretion vested
in it
under rule 2 and give summary judgment for the plaintiff. 
<P>

29   	At the outset, it must be recognised that the plaintiff
bears the responsibility of establishing that he is entitled to summary
judgment, and that in the circumstances of this case there is no triable issue.

<P>

30   	It must be appreciated, however, that no evidence has been
placed before the Court by the first defendant or the second defendant
in the
present application. Even if the affidavits relied upon by Mrs Mrish in her
applications in respect to her entitlement to
participate in the application
for summary judgment were relied upon by her in that application (and,
strictly, they are not before
the Court in the present application for summary
judgement, since they were not read or relied upon by Mrs Mrish at the hearing
of
that application), she does not of her own knowledge depose to any matters
relevant to the issues between the parties which emerge
upon the pleadings
(apart from the fact, to which I shall later again refer, that the first
defendant forged the signature of Mrs
Mrish upon a mortgage and that the first
defendant admitted to having forged her signature on a document). Only the
first defendant,
who verified the defence of the first and second defendants,
had or would have had personal knowledge of those matters and events.
I have
already recorded that I rejected the application of Mrs Mrish to place in
evidence the affidavit of the first defendant sworn
20 April 1998. 
<P>

31   	Since the first defendant is dead, no evidence would be
available from him at a final hearing if it were necessary for the
proceedings
ultimately to go to trial. That is a fact which, in my view, should not be
overlooked, when approaching the present application.
It means that, if the
matter were to proceed to a final hearing, the plaintiff would be put to proof
of his case, but that, as I
understand it, there would not be any evidence
available to be tendered on behalf of the first and second defendants which
would
address the issues of undue influence, threats and blackmail.
<P>

32   	It was submitted on behalf of Mrs Mrish that, not only did
the plaintiff bear the responsibility of establishing his entitlement
to
summary judgment, but that it was also for the plaintiff to satisfy the Court
that there is no real question to be tried. Counsel
for Mrs Mrish properly
emphasised that, since the plaintiff carries the onus of satisfying the Court
of his entitlement to summary
judgment, it is not for Mrs Mrish or the
defendants affirmatively to establish the defence.
<P>

33   	Further, Mrs Mrish submitted that summary judgment should
be refused upon the following grounds. Firstly, that, by reason
of section 88
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act </i>1970</a>, the procedure for summary judgment is not
available in the instant case. Secondly, that there is a real issue of fact to
be decided.

<P>

34   	It has already been observed that the present application
is brought pursuant to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> rule 1 of the Supreme Court
Rules. That rule falls within Division 1 of Part 13. Rule 1 of that Part
provides,
<P>

This Division applies to all proceedings except proceedings within the
application of section 88 of the Act (which relates to cases
of fraud and other
matters). 
<P>

35   	Section 88 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> provides,
<P>

Proceedings on a common law claim in which there are issues of fact ---
<P>

(a) 	on a charge of fraud against a party; or
<P>

(b)	on a claim in respect of defamation, malicious prosecution, false
imprisonment, seduction or breach of promise of marriage,
<P>

shall be tried with a jury.
<P>

36   	It was submitted on behalf of Mrs Mrish that where, as
here, there is a charge of fraud against a party (said to be the assertion
of
the plaintiff of fraud perpetrated by the first defendant against at least Mr
and Mrs Dresler --- Mrs Mrish refers to paragraphs
3, 5, 6, 10 and 13 or the
statement of claim), the plaintiff is precluded from availing himself of the
summary judgment procedure
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2</a> of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13.</a>
<P>

37   	I have been taken by Counsel for Mrs Mrish to the decision
of the Court of Appeal in <i>Horrobin v ANZ Banking Group</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR
89</a>, especially to the judgement of Mahoney A-CJ, who, at 96-97, considered the
effect of section 88 of the Act upon an application for
summary judgment. That
was a case in which the respondent bank had, at first instance, sought to
recover from the appellant certain
mortgaged property, and the appellant by his
defence had raised equitable principles, including an assertion of fraud
perpetrated
by the bank. His Honour said, at 97, that "[t]he fact that the
issues of fact in question arise in relation to a defence rather than
in
respect of the plaintiff's claim does not, as such, exclude the operation of
section 88". However, His Honour then continued,

<P>

But it is at least arguable that, for other reasons, section 88 does not apply.
The fraud relied on is not mere equitable fraud.
It is, on one view of the
defence, fraud arising from a direct and deliberate misrepresentation or
warranty: see generally <i>Newton Chemical Limited v Arsenis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WLR%201297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WLR
1297.</a> However, the relief to be given to the defendants if they succeed in
establishing their claim of fraud against ANZ will or may be
equitable relief
rather than common law relief. 
<P>

It is not clear how far section 88 is intended to apply if, that this ground be
common law deceit or fraud, the relief sought is
relief which, in its
concurrent jurisdiction, would be given by a court of equity. 
<P>

This is matter which, in a suitable case, will require consideration. In such
circumstances, operation of section 88 has not been
determined in this State.
It is in my opinion not necessary to pursue further the construction of section
88 because of the matters
to which I shall refer. 
<P>

Section 88 is framed in mandatory terms: "shall" is used. But its operation
may, I think, be qualified by the circumstances. Thus,
I do not doubt that the
parties may, by agreement, dispense with a jury trial even in a case fairly
within the section. There are
no doubt cases in which the relief sought against
the fraudster is such that it is not possible or appropriate to have what is to
be done to be decided by a jury's verdict.
<P>

Having regard to the form of the defence and of the relief which is or may be
claimed by the defendants, it may be arguable that
the proceeding, the defence,
is not one "within the application of section 88...." within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 1.</a> I
therefore do not decide the appeal upon that basis.
<P>

I prefer to reach my decision upon the fact that the relevant defence is not
"so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly stand":
<i>General Steel
Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> at
130.
<P>

38   	It seems to me that, whilst His Honour in <i>Horrobin</i>
clearly did not regard that case as an appropriate vehicle for a definitive
consideration of the overall effect of the operation
of section 88, he was
obviously of the view that that section (the clear intent of which was to
preclude the summary judgment procedure
in cases which ultimately are to be
decided by a jury) might not have application to a situation where, although a
charge of fraud
is made, the final relief is of an equitable nature.
<P>

39   	In the instant case the charge of fraud (encompassed by
the assertions of undue influence, threats and blackmail) is made
by the
plaintiff against the first defendant. There is no suggestion that the first
defendant acquired by fraud the various properties
in respect to which the
plaintiff now desires to apply a tracing exercise. That is, it is not suggested
that as against the vendors
of those properties the first defendant exercised
fraud. What is being asserted by the plaintiff is that the funds which the
first
defendant used to acquire those properties were funds which, through
fraud, he had obtained from Mr and Mrs Dresler; and that, in
consequence, those
funds may by the plaintiff be traced into the properties held by the defendants
which were acquired with those
fraudulently obtained funds. 
<P>

40   	The relief which the plaintiff seeks is relief of
equitable nature. The proceedings have, properly, been instituted in the
Equity
Division. It is in my view not without significance that the provisions of
section 88 deal with "[p]roceedings on a common
law claim". The present is not
a common law claim by the plaintiff. The proceedings presently before the Court
are an equitable claim
grounded upon equitable principles and seeking equitable
relief. This is not a claim grounded upon, for example, contract or tort.
Such
a claim would clearly fall within the description of proceedings on a common
law claim. 
<P>

41   	I am not persuaded that section 88 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></i> precludes the availability to the plaintiff of the summary judgment
procedure set forth in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules. 
<P>

42   	I turn then to the second ground upon which Mrs Mrish
relies in opposition to the present claim for summary judgment. That
ground is
that there is a real issue of fact to be decided. 
<P>

43   	The principles here relevant are well known and do not
need to be repeated. (See, for example, <i>General Steel Industries Inc. v
Commissioner for Railways (NSW)</i> at 130.)
<P>

44   	It is not necessary for the Court to conclude that the
defendant would certainly succeed at a final hearing. It is sufficient
if the
Court concludes that the defences raised are not "hopeless" or "manifestly
groundless" (<i>Wentworth v Rogers </i>(No.5)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 534</a>, especially
per Kirby P).
<P>

45   	Counsel for Mrs Mrish submitted, correctly, that it is for
the plaintiff to establish that there is no defence --- that it
is not for Mrs
Mrish or the defendants to establish that there is a defence. 
<P>

46   	The arguable defence relied upon by the first and second
defendants was that the moneys which were given by Mr and Mrs Dresler
to the
first defendant were given gratuitously. That such was the fact can, so it was
submitted by Mrs Mrish, be inferred from the
letters which are annexures Y and
Z to the affidavit of the plaintiff sworn 7 July 1993. The statement in
paragraph 72 of that affidavit
that the deponent "can say from such letter that
I have never known my father to sign his signature "Wally Dresler" as he has
always
used the words "O. Dresler" (which statement was admitted over the
objection by the first and second defendants) may entitle the
Court to draw the
inference that that letter either was forged or was written under duress. (It
is of interest here to note that
each of the letters of 17 February
1993(annexure Y), purported to be signed by each of Mr and Mrs Dresler, and 17
February 1993 (annexure
Z), purported to be signed by Mrs Dresler alone,
purports to have been witnessed by one H Blunden. No evidence have been placed
before
the Court in the present application concerning that purported
witness.)
<P>

47   	However, the submission that the foregoing letters support
an argument that the moneys transferred from Mr and Mrs Dresler
to the first
defendant constituted gifts by them to the first defendant is a submission
which is inconsistent with the case for the
defendants as disclosed in the
defence (verified by affidavit of the first defendant sworn 20 April 1998 and
filed on 28 September
1998). 
<P>

48   	By paragraph 12 (ii) of the defence the first defendant
expressly admits that the money and assets particularised in paragraphs
(b),
(d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) [which moneys, I here interpolate, total $285,016.73
and which assets comprise the property situate
at and known as Merino Road,
Noraville] were transferred, paid or assigned to the first defendant
[<i>sic</i>]on or about the dates particularised by the plaintiff, and in
relation to 12 (g) and 12 (h) on about 18 November 1992 and on about
11
November 1992 respectively. Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph 12 of the defence
expressly asserts that each of the items of money
and assets referred to in
subparagraph (ii) was transferred, paid or assigned to the defendant for
valuable consideration and pursuant
to agreement entered with Mr and Mrs
Dresler on the dates referred to in subparagraph (ii). Subparagraph (iv)
expressly asserts that
it was a term of the agreement for transfer, payment or
assignment of each of the items of money referred to in paragraph 12 (b),
(d),
(e), (f) and (g) that the defendant would pay to Mr and Mrs Dresler or either
of them the cash amount equivalent to the amount
transferred, paid or assigned
to the defendant, together with an additional 10 percent paid in cash for the
benefit of Mr and Mrs
Dresler. Subparagraph (v) expressly pleads that it was a
term of the said agreement for transfer, payment or assignment of the said
money to the first defendant that Mr and Mrs Dresler would supply to the first
defendant "written letters of gift for the benefit
of the defendant" and in
consideration of the first defendant's cash payments of equivalent amounts
together with the said additional
10 percent to Mr and Mrs Dresler.
<P>

49   	Further, subparagraph (vi) of paragraph 12 of the defence
expressly pleads that as to the property situate at and known as
2 Merino Road,
Noraville, the transfer or assignment of that asset to the first defendant was
in consideration of the payment of
$130,000 in cash by the first defendant to
Mr Dresler at about the date appearing on the contract for sale. 
<P>

50   	In the light of the foregoing assertions expressly pleaded
in paragraph 12 of the defence, it is not open to Mrs Mrish to
submit that the
transfers and payments of money and property referred to in the foregoing
subparagraphs of that paragraph were made
gratuitously, or that the letters
were which are annexures Y and Z to the plaintiff's affidavit of 7 July 1993
somehow support the
existence of such gifts. According to the defendants'
pleading, those letters were provided in fulfilment of an agreement between
Mr
and Mrs Dresler of the one part and the first defendant of the other part,
whereby, so it is alleged on the part of the first
defendant, Mr and Mrs
Dresler received valuable consideration for the transfer of the Noraville
property and the payment of the moneys.
That is, even on the case for the
defendants pleaded by them in the defence, Mr and Mrs Dresler would be
entitled, under the terms
of the agreement so pleaded by the defendants, to
receive from the first defendant an amount of $456,518.40 (being the totality
of
the foregoing sum of $285,016.73, together with the attributed payment of
$130,000 for the Noraville property (totalling $415,016.72),
together with an
additional 10 percent upon that total figure).
<P>

51   	Accordingly, as to the Noraville property and as to the
various amounts of money referred to in subparagraphs (b), (d), (e),
(f) and
(g) of paragraph 12 of the statement of claim, I am satisfied that there is no
arguable defence, and that the plaintiff is
entitled to summary judgment in
respect to the claims for relief relating to those various assets.
<P>

52   	By paragraph 13 (a) of the defence the defendants admit
that the property situate at and known as 26 Banksia Street, Eastwood
(which
was and had for many years been the family home of Mr and Mrs Dresler and of
their children) was transferred by Mr and Mrs
Dresler to the second defendant
pursuant to a contract for sale executed by Mr and Mrs Dresler, in
consideration of the payment of
$280,000 in cash by the first defendant to Mr
Dresler. 
<P>

53   	Apart from the assertion (contained in paragraph 13 (a) of
the defence and repeated, in more general terms, in paragraph 14
(b) (i) of
that pleading) that the payment for the Banksia Street property was made in
cash by the first defendant, no particulars
of such payment are supplied in the
pleading. Neither is any information about that alleged payment made in any of
the evidence filed
on behalf of Mrs Mrish in the present application. No such
cash has been located by Mr Robertson or by the plaintiff. The evidence
of Mr
Robertson concerning the various financial transactions of the Mr and Mrs
Dresler with the first defendant supports the inference
that, despite the
verified defence asserting such a cash payment, no such cash payment was ever
received by Mr and Mrs Dresler for
the transfer of their family home, in which
they continued to reside until the time when they were murdered by the first
defendant.

<P>

54   	The objective circumstances of this case make it extremely
unlikely that Mr and Mrs Dresler, who had lived in the Eastwood
residence for
almost 26 years, since December 1967, and who had made it their family home
throughout that period and who had expressed
to the plaintiff their intention
to remain there for the rest of their days, would have transferred that
property to the first defendant
for a payment in cash, the existence of which
payment is supported only by the assertion contained in paragraph 13 of the
defence.

<P>

55   	I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to summary
judgment in respect to the Banksia Street property.
<P>

56   	By paragraph 13 (b) of the defence the first and second
defendants admit that the mortgage which is referred to in paragraph
13 (b) of
the statement of claim as the Bilbomar Mortgage was transferred or assigned to
the second defendant by agreement entered
between Mr Dresler and the first and
second defendants in consideration of the payment by the first defendant to Mr
Dresler of $145,000
in cash. It is asserted in that paragraph of the defence
that that amount was paid by the first defendant subsequent to and on the
day
of transfer, and particulars are given concerning a letter dated 19 January
1993 from Gates Moffit, Solicitors, to Mr Dresler,
a mortgage dated 12 February
1993 and a reassignment of interest dated 12 February 1993. 
<P>

57   	There is no evidence, apart from the assertion contained
in paragraph 13 (b) of the defence, of the fact of the alleged payment
by the
first defendant to Mr Dresler in respect to that mortgage, or concerning the
details or circumstances of that alleged payment
in cash. No such cash has been
located by Mr Robertson or by the plaintiff. The evidence of Mr Robertson
concerning the various financial
transactions of Mr and Mrs Dresler with the
first defendant supports the inference that, despite the verified defence
asserting such
a cash payment, no such cash payment was ever received by Mr and
Mrs Dresler. I am not satisfied that there is a triable issue concerning
the
alleged payment by the first defendant of this amount of money in cash to Mr
Dresler. 
<P>

58   	It appears to me to be of considerable significance in
approaching the defence of the first and second defendants that the
various
transfers and assignments of money and assets by Mr and Mrs Dresler to those
defendants was made for valuable consideration,
and the further assertion that
such valuable consideration was paid by the first defendant to either Mr and
Mrs Dresler or Mr Dresler
alone in cash, that the first defendant not long
thereafter murdered each of Mr and Mrs Dresler. That is a significant objective
fact, which should not be disregarded in the present application for summary
judgment. If there had been no undue influence, threats
or blackmail exercised
by the first defendant upon Mr and Mrs Dresler, or if the first defendant had,
in fact, made the cash payments
asserted by him in the defence to have been
made, there would have been little or no reason for him to have murdered Mr and
Mrs Dresler.
It is in my view an entirely legitimate and obviously logical
inference to be drawn from the fact that the first defendant murdered
Mr and
Mrs Dresler, that he did not make the cash payments subsequently by him alleged
to have been made, that he did not enter into
an agreement whereby he would
return, with an additional 10 percent, various sums of money paid to him and a
house property transferred
to him, and that in causing those transfers to be
made he exercised upon Mr and Mrs Dresler undue influence, threats or
blackmail.
<P>

59   	In this regard I also consider it to be not without
significance that Mrs Mrish herself, in her affidavit of 6 April 1999,
states
at paragraph 16 that the first defendant forged her signature on a mortgage to
Westpac Banking Corporation, and states at
paragraph 25 that the first
defendant admitted to having forged her signature on a document. 
<P>

60   	I now turn to the summary judgment sought by the plaintiff
in respect to the property at 58 Dalton Street, Orange (claimed
in prayers 8 -
10 of the Statement of Claim) and the property at 73 Adams Street, Granville
(claimed in prayers 11 - 13). It is in
respect to the Dalton Street property
and the proceeds of sale of the Adams Street property (items 1 (b) and 4
respectively in the
inventory of property of the first defendant) that Mrs
Mrish has been permitted to participate in the hearing of the present
application
of the plaintiff. It is in respect to those assets (or, more
accurately, in the case of the Adams Street property, in respect to
the fund
representing that asset) that the plaintiff in the present application seeks to
apply the equitable doctrine of tracing,
so that the plaintiff will be able to
have resort not merely to a judgment for moneys obtained by the first defendant
from Mr and
Mrs Dresler, but to these specific assets which, so the plaintiff
submits, presently represent those moneys. 
<P>

61   	The evidence relating to the Dalton Street property
included Exhibit B. Part of that exhibit consisted of the diary notes
of the
manager of the Westpac Banking Corporation at Bathurst, where the first
defendant conducted an account. The diary note for
9 October 1992 discloses
that on that date the first defendant informed the manager that a deposit of
$155,000 had been expected
on 7 October. The note continued, "Mentioned he is
contracting to purchase a house for $85K in Orange suitable for conversion to
4
units. Intends paying cash for it from above deposit when to hand and then
approaching us for finance to develop." The diary continues
with a later entry
on the same date, "George phoned - cheque to be deposited today. Cheque to
purchase Orange property may need to
be drawn shortly." 
<P>

62   	On 12 October 1992 the first defendant deposited into his
account with the Bathurst branch of Westpac a cheque drawn in favour
of Mrish
Demolition &amp; Construction by BT Financial Services Limited in the sum of
$155,016.73. That amount represented the entirety
of a fund invested by the
late Mr Dresler with BT Financial Services Limited (Annexure DJR - 62 to report
of Mr Robertson).
<P>

63   	The Dalton Street property was acquired by the first
defendant shortly thereafter for $85,000. The transfer of that property
to the
first defendant was dated 27 November 1992. 
<P>

64   	It was submitted on behalf of Mrs Mrish that there is
nothing to connect Mr Dresler's $155,016.73 with the Dalton Street property.

<P>

65   	Nevertheless, I am satisfied that it is a legitimate
inference to be drawn from the statements made by the first defendant
to his
bank manager on 9 October 1992 that the first defendant proposed to use the
expected amount of $155,000 (an amount identical,
except for $16.73, to that
obtained by him from Mr Dresler) for the acquisition of the Orange property.
The first defendant purchased
the Dalton Street property shortly thereafter.
Although there is no evidence of the date of settlement of the purchase, the
transfer
was executed less than seven weeks after the first defendant obtained
Mr Dresler's money.
<P>

66   	There is no evidence that the first defendant acquired any
other property in Orange apart from the Dalton Street property.
There is no
evidence of any other funds being available to the first defendant to meet the
purchase price of $85,000, apart from
the amount of $155,017.73 from Mr
Dresler, which the first defendant stated to the bank manager he expected
already to have received,
and from which sum he proposed to pay cash for the
purchase of a house in Orange.
<P>

67   	I am satisfied from the foregoing evidence that there is
no arguable defence to the tracing exercise which, if performed in
the manner
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to the relief
which he seeks in respect to the Dalton
Street property. 
<P>

68   	There remains only to be considered the claim of the
plaintiff in respect to the proceeds of sale of the property situate
at and
known as 73 Adams Street, Granville. Those proceeds of sale constitute item 4
in the inventory of property of the first defendant
and are one of the assets
in respect of which Mrs Mrish has been given an opportunity to be heard in the
present application. (I
note that in the inventory of property the property is
referred to as "73 Adam Street, Guilford", whilst in the pleadings and in
the
evidence it is referred to as 73 Adams Street, Granville: the latter appears to
be its correct designation.) That property was
purchased by the first defendant
on 11 September 1992 for $113,500. It was sold by the Westpac Banking
Corporation as mortgagee in
possession in September 1997. 
<P>

69   	That property was paid for, in part, by a bank cheque in
the sum of $101,774.69 in September 1992. Substantial deposits, of
$100,000 and
$25,000 were made on 20 July 1992 and 30 July 1992 respectively into the
account of the first defendant, trading as
Mrish Demolition &amp; Construction.
In respect to the deposit of $25,000 on 30 July 1992, particulars of cheques
disclose that that
deposit was made up of three cheques, one drawn on the
Westpac Banking Corporation ($5,000) and two drawn on the Advance Bank (each
in
an amount of $10,000). The deposit of $100,000 is revealed by the details on
the deposit slip as having consisted of two bank
cheques, one in an amount of
$20,000 from the ANZ Bank at Eastwood, and the other in an amount of $80,000
from the Advance Bank at
North Sydney. The evidence of Mr Robertson discloses
(in paragraph 4 (b) of his report) that on 17 July 1992 there was a withdrawal
from the Advance Bank account in the name of W &amp; TD Dresler, paid to Mrish
Constructions, and that on the same date there was
a withdrawal from the ANZ
Bank account (in the name of K Austin for Dresler Family Trust) in the amount
of $20,000, paid to Mrish
Constructions. There is an identicality of amounts,
an identicality of the banks, and a close proximity between the date of the
withdrawal
from the accounts controlled by Mr and Mrs Dresler on 17 July 1992
and the deposits made into the account Mrish Demolition &amp;
Construction
three days later. 
<P>

70   	Counsel for Mrs Mrish has correctly identified the issue
as being the identity of the moneys used for the purchase of the
Granville
property. Despite the submission made on her behalf that there is no evidence
available from which the Court can infer
that the bank cheque in the amount of
$101,774.69 was drawn from funds obtained from Mr and Mrs Dresler, I am
satisfied that there
is a legitimate, indeed an almost unassailable, inference
available that the bank cheque which the first defendant used to purchase
the
Granville property had its origin in payments made from the foregoing accounts
controlled by Mr and Mrs Dresler. 
<P>

71   	Mrs Mrish submitted that there is no evidence from which
the Court can infer that the bank cheque in the amount of $101,774.69
was drawn
from funds obtained from Mr and Mrs Dresler. I have already expressed my view
that the identicality of withdrawals and
the proximity of dates more than
justifies such an inference. Mrs Mrish also submitted that there is no evidence
that the bank cheque
was drawn from an account conducted by the first
defendant. The bank cheque was in fact drawn at the request of LJ Hooker,
Granville
(as appears on the back of the requisition for such a bank cheque). I
do not have any difficulty in drawing the inference that where
the purchase
price of a piece of real estate has been made by way of a bank cheque
requisitioned by a firm of estate agents, that
the source of those funds for
the purchase of that bank cheque was the purchaser of the property, rather than
the estate agents,
acting from motives of personal benevolence. The purchaser
of the Adams Street property was the first defendant. 
<P>

72   	I have already referred to the assertions made in the
defence concerning the two sums of $80,000 and $100,000. There is, in
fact, no
basis upon which the Court could refuse summary judgment for the plaintiff
against the first defendant in respect to those
sums. The only question is
whether the relief of the nature which the plaintiff seeks (be it by way of
summary judgment or be it
by way of relief at a final hearing), being relief
which requires the Court to be satisfied that those sums were used for purchase
of the Granville property, can be appropriately awarded to the plaintiff. The
totality of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff
is already before the Court
concerning the tracing exercise upon which the plaintiff seeks to rely in
support of relief against the
Granville property. That evidence consists of the
evidence of Mr Robertson and of the various documents comprising Exhibit B in
the
application before me. That evidence satisfies me that there is no arguable
defence to the tracing exercise which, if performed in
the manner submitted on
behalf of the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to the relief which he
seeks in respect to the proceeds
of sale of the Adams Street property.
<P>

73   	It will be appreciated that by paragraph 12 (i) of the
defence the first defendant denied any transfer or payment to him in
respect to
the amounts of moneys referred to in paragraph 12 (a) ($98,606 on about 29 July
1992) or (c) ($10,000 on 5 August 1992)
in the statement of claim. The evidence
of Mr Robertson (paragraph F.4 (b) (viii)) concerning those amounts is that at
the date of
his report he "had not been able to determine who received those
funds". In the light of that evidence, I am not satisfied that the
plaintiff
has established an entitlement to summary judgment in respect to those two
amounts. Apart from the denial in the defence
to which I have referred, the
evidence appears to be silent concerning those amounts. Accordingly, the
plaintiff has not established
an entitlement to summary judgment in respect to
those two amounts. 
<P>

74   	However, I consider that the plaintiff has established an
entitlement to summary judgment of the nature sought concerning
the Banksia
Street property, the Merino Parade property, the Bilbomar mortgage, the Dalton
Street property and the proceeds of sale
of the Adams Street property. Further,
that the plaintiff has established an entitlement to summary judgment in
respect to the various
sums of money set forth in prayer 14 of the statement of
claim, other than the two amounts, to which I have already referred, set
forth
in paragraphs (a) and (c) of that prayer. The plaintiff is entitled to a
declaration of the nature sought in prayer 15, together
with an order for
payment of a sum of money of the nature sought in prayer 16 (although the
precise calculation of that sum will
need to be performed), together with
interest thereon pursuant to section 94 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>. I
consider that the plaintiff is also entitled to summary judgment for the taking
of accounts of the nature sought in prayer 17,
together with an order for
costs.
<P>

75   	It will be appreciated that, in consequence of the death
of the first defendant, relief in the precise terms sought in the
statement of
claim is no longer appropriate. Accordingly, I propose to stand the matter over
to a suitable date, to enable the plaintiff
to bring in short minutes of order
reflecting my foregoing conclusions. 
<P>

76   	The plaintiff has been successful in respect to his claim
for summary judgment in relation to the two assets concerning which
Mrs Mrish
was granted leave to participate in the hearing of the present application. I
should here record that, although the leave
granted to Mrs Mrish was of a
strictly limited nature, the participation in the hearing before me by her
Counsel and Solicitor was
conducted in a fashion which, in substance,
constituted a total opposition to the entitlement of the plaintiff to any
summary judgment
whatsoever in his favour. 
<P>

77   	Although I have not heard any submissions as to costs, it
seems to me appropriate in those circumstances that, to the extent
that the
plaintiff may not be able to recover his costs from the estate of the first
defendant or from the second defendant, the
costs of the notice of motion filed
by him on 30 November 1998 should be paid by Donna Marie Mrish. If however Mrs
Mrish wishes to
be heard concerning costs, I will give to her an opportunity to
do so.
<P>

78   	Accordingly, the only order which I presently make is as
follows:
<P>

1.	I stand the matter over to a date to be fixed by arrangement with my
Associate, for the bringing in of Short Minutes of Order,
to give effect to my
conclusions herein.
