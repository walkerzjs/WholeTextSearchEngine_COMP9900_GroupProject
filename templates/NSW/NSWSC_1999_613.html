<b>55044/98:	EXXON (AUSTRALIA) LTD (FORMERLY WHITE  INDUSTRIES LIMITED)      v
 CHADTECH PTY LTD  </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	In proceedings number 55044 of 1998 judgment was delivered
on 11 June 1999.  The parties have addressed on costs.  The defendant
seeks an
order for the payment by the plaintiff of the defendant's costs of the whole of
the proceedings on an indemnity basis. 
The defendant's written submissions in
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 read as follows:
<P>

<i>`2.	In its summons, the plaintiff contended that the arbitrator was guilty
of misconduct in that he had spoken at an industry body
seminar held at the
offices of Clayton Utz, solicitors for the defendant in the arbitration.  The
plaintiff did not abandon this
claim until after the filing and service of
affidavits, notwithstanding an invitation from the defendant, prior to the
first directions
hearing, to discontinue.  A substantial part of the
defendant's evidence addressed the allegations raised by the plaintiff in
paragraph
C11.  This allegation of bias had no real prospect of success.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	The balance of the plaintiff's misconduct case concerned whether or not
certain matters had been ventilated at the arbitration
and whether or not the
plaintiff had been denied natural justice.  The plaintiff did not avail itself
of the defendant's early invitation
to discontinue.  At the hearing of the
summons, the plaintiff abandoned one of its four contentions of misconduct, as
it had no real
prospect of success.  In respect of the remaining three
contentions, the Court foreshadowed the appropriateness of an indemnity costs
order on the basis that it should be clear to the parties whether or not a
matter was raised at the arbitration (see p 24 lines 13-45
of the transcript).
It is respectfully submitted that the reasons for judgment handed down by the
Court recognise the absence of
substance in the plaintiff's claim.  It is
submitted that an order for costs on an indemnity basis ought be made.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	The plaintiff did not avail itself of the defendant's early invitation to
discontinue.  Given the high threshold which a plaintiff
must overcome in order
to obtain leave to appeal from an arbitral award, it is submitted that the
leave application was bound to
fail given:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the nature of the errors contended for by the plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the weakness of the plaintiff's case;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the lack of utility in granting leave in respect of an outdated form of
contract;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the age of the arbitration proceedings;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	the quantum of the award.</i>
<P>

<i>In the circumstances, the plaintiff ought to have been alive to the futility
of seeking leave and its prospects of success.  It is
submited that this is the
kind of leave application in respect of which an indemnity costs order ought be
made.'</i>
<P>

2   	The plaintiff does not oppose an order that it pay the
defendant's costs but submits that those costs ought not be on an indemnity
basis but ought simply be on a party party basis.
<P>

3   	Paragraphs 2 to 5 of the defendant's written submissions on
costs are in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`2.	The letter of 3 November 1998 had no sufficient measure of compromise
about it.  Agreement to discontinuance carried no compromise.
 Agreement not to
seek costs carried virtually none, as minimal costs would have been incurred,
the Summons having only just been
served.  See Hobartville Stud v Union
Insurance  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 358</a> at 367C-368D.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Summons paragraph 11.  By letter dated 2 March 1999 the Plaintiff's
Solicitors advised that "the Plaintiff has decided not to proceed
with the
matters raised in paragraph C11".  The Plaintiff did not, and does not, accept
that this claim could be categorised as "hopeless".
 The Plaintiff's decision
followed the opportunity to consider the Defendant's evidence on this
issue.</i>
<P>

<i>3[sic].	Summons paragraph 12(c) (misconduct).  This was not pressed in
circumstances put in the Plaintiff's written submissions at
the hearing (and
see transcript (T) 50 line (1.) 25:</i>
<P>

<i>"It is now apparent that the Arbitrator did raise this issue (transcript Tab
74 p.72, letter 16 July 1998 Tab 63 p.2) for the consideration
of the parties
and whilst they did not address it, it can no longer be contended that there
was a denial of natural justice involved.
 This claim is accordingly withdrawn
but see Summons par.14(i)."</i>
<P>

<i>The same matters however were pressed in respect of Summons paragraph 14(i)
(leave to appeal) (T52 1.52).</i>
<P>

<i>4.	Summons paragraph 14(f) and (g).  Paragraph 14(g) was not pressed in the
Plaintiff's written submissions (par.9).  Paragraph 14(f)
was not pressed at
the hearing (T61 1.26).  Paragraph 14(e) was pressed (T61 1.10) and indeed, was
dealt with in the judgment pars.
100-103;  the suggestion in par.68 of the
judgment that it was not pressed was, with respect, in error.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	Whilst an issue which is not pressed must carry the penalty of costs,
there is no authority which suggests it should necessarily
carry indemnity
costs (cf. Rouse v Shepherd (No. 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=35%20NSWLR%202777" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">35 NSWLR 2777).</a>  A responsible decision not
to press an issue should be rewarded, not penalised.  It is also to the point
that multiple issues were
involved in the proceedings and paragraphs 12(e),
14(f) and 14(g) could not be singled out as carrying any special or individual
costs.''</i>
<P>

4   	There has been read on the costs argument, an affidavit by
Mr F.P. Hicks of 18 June 1999, which annexes correspondence between
the parties
dealing with the question of costs.
<P>

5   	It is plain from that affidavit and that correspondence
that the defendant, having reviewed paragraph C11 of the summons, was
content
to deny the contention contended therein.  It is also plain that from 3rd
November 1998 Clayton Utz for the defendant, made
plain to the plaintiff's
solicitors Mallesons Stephen Jaques, that the plaintiff was invited to
discontinue the proceedings and that
<i>Calderbank v Calderbank</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%203%20All%20ER%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 3
All ER 333</a> would be relied upon in the event of the defendant's success.
<P>

6   	Having given the matter some close consideration, it seems
to me that the significant point is that by the letter of 2 March
1999, the
plaintiff notified the defendant that it no longer intended to press the
allegation of misconduct against the arbitrator
raised in paragraph C11.
<P>

7   	In those circumstances, to my mind the appropriate order is
that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs on an indemnity basis
of the issue
raised by paragraph C11 to the summons.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff, having elected no longer to press that sub
paragraph, to my mind the proper inference is that the plaintiff
ought not to
have commenced the proceedings with that paragraph included and had no case in
relation to that matter.  <i>Cf Huntsman Chemical Company v International Pools
Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 242</a> at 251 per Mahoney JA.
<P>

9   	I do not see it as a situation in which the plaintiff ought
be excused from that conduct.
<P>

10   	The Court orders are:
<P>

1.	Summons dismissed.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs in relation to the issue
raised by paragraph C11 of the contentions in the summons
on an indemnity basis
and the plaintiff is otherwise to pay the defendant's costs on a party party
basis.
