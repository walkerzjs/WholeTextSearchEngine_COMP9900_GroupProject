<P>

Defendant
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>8 June 1999</b>
<P>

1   	What follow are my reasons for making the orders contained
in the Short Minutes of Order.
<P>

<b>Factual Background</b>
<P>

2   	The company gave a charge dated 13 November 1998 in favour
of Mary Tamone and Frank Tamone. That charge was a fixed and floating
charge
over the assets of the company and was a charge over the whole of those assets
and as such was required to be registered pursuant
to s262(1)(a) of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

3   	The requirement of the Law was that it be registered within
45 days of being given.
<P>

4   	The amount of the advance made under the charge was the sum
of $60,000.00 and there appears to be no dispute that the advance
was given:
see affidavit of Martin Green 19 May 1999 annexure B.
<P>

5   	The charge, on its face, was prepared by a firm of
solicitors and it would appear that it was returned by the company's
accountants
to the solicitors on or about 23 December 1998.
<P>

6   	As the charge was given on 13 November, it was required to
be registered within 45 days so that it had to be lodged for registration
with
the Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission by 28 December 1998.
<P>

7   	The 28 December 1998 was a public holiday and by virtue of
the Interpretation At the last day for the lodgment of the charge
was extended
until 29 December 1998.
<P>

8   	It appears from a letter from the solicitors addressed to
the plaintiff's accountants that the charge was placed on the desk
of the
firm's registration clerk who one infers would normally be entrusted with its
filing on the afternoon of 23 December which
was very shortly before the
Christmas break. According to the solicitors their office was closed from 1 pm
on 24 December until 4
January.
<P>

9   	The 29th, 30th and 31st December were days on which the
office of the Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission were
open for
business. In fact what happened was that the charge was overlooked by the
registration clerk and not lodged for registration
until 4 January 1999. On
this date it was registered and the registration certificate appears as
annexure A to the affidavit of Warwick
van Ede of 1 May 1999.
<P>

10   	The 3 January 1999 was a Sunday and a holiday as, of
course, was the 1 January.
<P>

11   	The charge was registered on 4 January 1999.
<P>

12   	On 6 January 1999 Martin Green was appointed voluntary
administrator of the company by resolution of its directors. There
is no
evidence one way or another as to whether the company ever did anything to
register the charge although it is clear from the
legislation that it is the
company's obligation to do so (s263(1)). However, the Tamones are interested
persons.
<P>

13   	It would appear that no scheme of arrangement was promoted
under the voluntary administration and the company went into liquidation
on 2
February 1999 and Mr Green was appointed the liquidator. He remains the
liquidator.
<P>

14   	The Tamones are not persons who are related to those who
controlled the company. There is no evidence that they are shareholders
or
directors of it. The evidence would suggest that they simply were investors who
invested $60,000.
<P>

15   	The evidence suggests that the liquidator has realised the
assets of the company in a sum of about $70,000. He is owed fees
and there are
employees' claims which would normally have priority to the claim of the
holders of the floating charge.
<P>

16   	There are unsecured creditors of the company of about
$126,000.
<P>

17   	If the extension of time to register the charge be
granted, unsecured creditors it would appear receive nothing although the
employees apparently would be paid.
<P>

18   	If an extension of time to register the charge is not
granted, it would appear that the charge would be void as the notice
was not
filed within the relevant period pursuant to s266(1)(b)(i) of the Law. 
<P>

19   	Reference to the "critical day" has no application as the
notice of the charge was simply not registered within the 45 days
and that
would be the relevant period.
<P>

20   	The liquidator has taken no steps to seek to avoid the
charge and in his first affidavit filed in the proceedings he stated
that he
neither opposed nor consented to the orders which were sought in the summons.
He is, it is submitted, a sufficient representative
of the unsecured creditors
of the company.
<P>

<b>LEGAL PRINCIPLES</b>
<P>

21   	I am asked to exercise my discretion pursuant to s266(4)
to extend the period of notice by six days in circumstances where:
<P>

(a)	the failure to register was clearly enough accidental and due to
inadvertence either of which being sufficient to invoke the
discretion,
<P>

(b)	though it is not possible to determine with accuracy the precise quantum of
debt incurred during the period from the last day
the charge should have been
registered (29 December 1998) to the date it was in fact registered on 4
January 1999, it can reasonably
be inferred from the make-up of trade creditors
(PX2) that over the holiday period in question, little debt would have been
incurred
as distinct from accruing in the ordinary course, such that the
prejudice to those creditors in making the orders sought is unlikely
to be
significant, whereas the prejudice to the Plaintiff in otherwise having her
charge set aside, she being an arm's length creditor,
would be substantial, and
in any event my orders are without prejudice to the rights of intervening
creditors.
<P>

22   	The cases are at one in acknowledging that when a company
goes into liquidation and subsequently an application is made for
extension of
time to register a charge that it is for the applicant to demonstrate
exceptional circumstances justifying the extension
being granted and that there
is no invariable rule that the discretion is not exercised. There is one
decision of a full court or
court of appeal, namely that of the Queensland
Court of Appeal in <i>Sanwa Australia Finance Limited v Ground-Breakers Pty
Limited (in liquidation)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%2d90%29%202%20ACSR%20692" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989-90) 2 ACSR 692.</a> At 699 Kelly SPJ stated that
the following principles had emerged:
<P>

"(a)	The fact of winding up is relevant to the exercise of the discretion but
does not require that the discretion be exercised
in one way.
<P>

(b)	the probable detrimental effect of the making of the order on unsecured
creditors is a relevant but not overriding consideration.
<P>

(c)	The discretion is sparingly exercised and if a company is obviously
insolvent or already in liquidation it will be exercised
only in circumstances
which may properly be regarded as exceptional."
<P>

Then, taking the summation of relevant factors bearing upon that discretion
from the headnote where conveniently stated (S being
the chargee and G-B the
chargor) and which led to its favourable exercise:
<P>

"Relevant factors in favour of the exercise of the discretion are:
<P>

(a)	the charges were in each case registered and notices lodged prior to the
commencement of the winding up.
<P>

(b)	The time which elapsed between the dates on which the notices should have
been lodged and when they were in fact lodged, although
significant, was such
that it could be said that S remedied its default within a reasonable time.
<P>

(c)	None of the charges was over the whole of G-B's assets.
<P>

(d)	If an order were not made, S, which had given value for its securities,
although admittedly in default by reason of the inadvertence
of its servants or
agents, would be deprived of the benefit of those securities.
<P>

(e)	There was no evidence that any unsecured creditor extended credit or
advanced money to G-B after searching the register at a
time when it did not
but should have disclosed the existence of the charges.
<P>

(f)	S when entering into the transactions, had no reason to have any concern
with the solvency of the respondent.
<P>

Relevant factors which operate against the exercise of the discretion are:
<P>

(a)	It was S as grantee by its then solicitors which was responsible for the
failure to lodge the respective notices within due
time.
<P>

(b)	There was a delay of some 3 months after the appointment of the provisional
liquidator before the application for the extension
of time was filed
<P>

(c)	The rights and interests acquired by the unsecured creditors upon the
liquidation of G-B would be displaced.
<P>

(d)	The reluctance of the courts to make such an order when a company is in
liquidation."
<P>

23   	As is well settled, a single judge construing uniform
legislation such as the <i>Corporations Law</i> should not depart from
decisions of a full court or court of appeal unless manifestly wrong;
concededly the practical effect of that
stricture is reduced where the
precedent in question operates in an area of discretion as then, inherently,
courts must have regard
to the variety of circumstances before them. Thus I
consider that, when exercising that discretion, it would be going too far in
light of <i>Sanwa</i> to conclude that "an extension of time will almost
invariably be refused after the commencement of a winding-up" if Wheeler J's
judgment
in <i>Morris v Woodings &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%20636" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 ACSR 636</a> were
understood as precluding exceptional circumstances being be made out in a case
such as the present. I say that, with respect
to the careful reasoning in that
case, because its result in not very different circumstances was to deny the
extension. 
<P>

24   	In the present case all of the factors favouring the
exercise of the discretion in <i>Sanwa</i> save one are present and indeed in
one case more strongly. Thus the time which elapsed between the date on which
registration should
have occurred at the latest and the time in which it in
fact occurred was hardly significant in contrast to <i>Sanwa</i>. The
liquidator was only subsequently appointed following the voluntary
administration of the Defendant and the voluntary administration
likewise
post-dated the charge's registration. The only respect in which the relevant
factors present in <i>Sanwa</i> favouring exercise of discretion were
<i>not</i> present was that the charge here is over the whole of the
Defendant's assets. But I do not consider anything turns on that.
<P>

25   	I should add that the authority relied upon by Wheeler J
in <i>Morris v Woodings,</i>  <i>J J Leonard Properties v Leonard (WA) Pty Ltd
(in liq)  No. 2</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20ACLR%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 ACLR 77</a> involved a very extensive delay of some
years in seeking late registration.
<P>

26   	I adopt what was said by Needham J in <i>Vector Capital
Limited v SNS Software Network Systems Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 1</a> at
7:
<P>

"There is no case binding on me which requires me to hold that the insolvency,
or commencement of a winding up, or appointment of
an official manager or,
before the application is heard or made is a factor fatal to an application to
extend time pursuant to s205(3).
For the reasons I have given my opinion is
that the fact of winding up is relevant to the exercise of a discretion but
does not require
the discretionary exercise in one way. So to hold would be to
destroy the discretion.
<P>

The sub-section envisages five alternative circumstances in which the order
might be made. One of those is that the failure to lodge
the notice `is not of
a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders'.
<P>

It follows, logically, that, in the case of the other four situations the order
may be made if that circumstances does not exist.
The ambit of the discretion
must not, in my opinion, be circumscribed by considerations inconsistent with
the legislation."
<P>

27   	It should be here noted that the liquidator who represents
the creditors for this purpose neither consents nor opposes the
extension and
has not attended the Court, though has provided an affidavit.
<P>

28   	In all the circumstances, though the inadvertence is to be
regretted, I have concluded that the exceptional circumstances
warranting the
making of orders in what is a liquidation situation are nonetheless made
out.
<P>

29   	I make the orders accordingly.
<P>
