EQUITY DIVISION

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Tuesday, 9 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1463/99	KERRY FRANCES MARGARET HUMBLE   -v-   CHRISTOPHER POOLE BY HIS TUTOR
MIRIAM POOLE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>	I have not been informed as to the basis
upon which this matter has been brought before the Court, that is, whether it
is grounded
upon some statutory provision or upon some provision of the Rules.

<P>

2   	It may be that the parties bring this application pursuant
to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s84.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 84</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act </i>1925</a>. If that be so,
then my reading of schedule D to the Supreme Court Rules indicates that a
Master does not under that schedule have
the power to make orders under that
section.
<P>

3   	It is open to the plaintiffs, if they so desire, to obtain
an order from a Judge referring the hearing of the matter to a Master.
Otherwise, upon what I have been informed by the legal representatives of the
parties, it would seem to me that the matter would
otherwise be dealt with by a
Judge.
<P>

4   	In any event, I do not consider that the evidence before
the Court concerning the present financial and material circumstances
of the
defendant, who is an infant aged eleven years, is adequate to allow the Court
to make an order of the nature sought in the
notice of motion.  In that regard,
I note that, although the summons seeks approval of an agreement which includes
a term that the
plaintiff pay to the defendant the sum of $50,000, the
agreement now reached between the parties seems to be that the plaintiff pay
to
the defendant the sum of $55,000.
<P>

5   	The evidence filed on behalf of the plaintiff, being the
affidavit of Kerry Frances Margaret Humble sworn 15 February 1999,
is
manifestly incomplete. Various annexures asserted to be attached thereto are
not attached. Copies which are stated to be complete
annexures will be retained
in the file.
<P>

6   	Also there will be retained a copy of the letters of
administration with the Will annexed in respect to the estate of the late
Hamish David Poole.
<P>

7   	To enable the parties to give consideration to the various
problems which have been disclosed during this morning's hearing,
at the
request of the parties I stand the matter over to Tuesday, 23 March, 1999
before the Registrar.
<P>
