<P>

<b>3613/97 - HIBBINS v INGRAM;  ESTATE OF FRANCIS McKINNON WERNER
DECEASED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>ACTING MASTER:   </b>The plaintiff commenced proceedings
on 14 August 1997 for an order that a constructive trust be imposed on the
interest of the defendant
as administratrix of the estate of the late Francis
McKinnon Werner in respect of the property known as Lot 1 McAlister Road,
Galston
in favour of the plaintiff as to 12% of the interest of the defendant.
Alternatively, a declaration that she holds an interest to
the extent of 12%
subject to a constructive trust in favour of the plaintiff, and thirdly, a
declaration that the plaintiff is entitled
to an equitable lien over the
property  to secure payment to the plaintiff of an amount equivalent to 12% of
the interest of the
defendant in the property.  Further, that provision be made
out of the estate of the deceased pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
for the maintenance, education and advancement in life of the plaintiff.
<P>

2   	The deceased was born on 25 December 1943.  The plaintiff
was born on 30 September 1962.  They met each other in 1987 and by
about March
of 1988 the plaintiff moved into the deceased's home at 7 McAlister Road,
Galston and commenced to cohabitate in a homosexual
relationship.  The parties
continued to reside at  that property and live in a homosexual relationship
until 1994.  
<P>

3   	In June of that year, the plaintiff went on a holiday to
Queensland and remained there until 26 November 1994.  During October
the
deceased travelled to Cairns and spent 12 days with the plaintiff touring
Cairns and the surrounding districts.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff returned to the deceased's property on 26
November 1994 and continued to live with him until September 1995.
 In July
1995 the plaintiff had reconstructive knee surgery.  After the operation,
during the recuperation period, the plaintiff
became frustrated and depressed
with his lack of recovery.  He says that the deceased encouraged him to return
to Queensland to enable
the recuperation period to continue in a better
environment.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff moved to Cairns in September 1995.  Most of
his personal effects remained at the Galston property.  The parties
kept some
contact with one another during this period and it was planned that the
deceased would join the plaintiff on 17 November
1995.  At about this time the
deceased was planning to retire.  According to the plaintiff's evidence the
deceased's intention was
that he would move to Queensland and resume
cohabitation with the plaintiff.
<P>

6   	This did not happen.  The deceased later informed the
plaintiff he was unable to go to Queensland at  that particular time
because he
had developed shingles on his chest and because of the death of a favourite dog
he was too upset to travel.  The deceased
never made it to Queensland.  On 17
February 1996 he had a telephone conversation with the plaintiff in which he
informed the plaintiff
that he had been diagnosed as having AIDS. 
<P>

7   	Subsequently some time between 17 and 18 February the
deceased took his life.  The plaintiff's evidence is that on being informed
by
a neighbour of the deceased of his death, he returned to Sydney and to the
Galston house and stayed there until the funeral. 
Subsequently he returned to
Cairns.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff's evidence is that during 1987, he sold his
interests in a property at Burragorang and applied the proceeds of
sale and his
savings towards the cost of the construction of the in-ground pool on the
deceased's land.  It is on the basis of the
contribution made by the plaintiff
towards the construction of the pool that the first three orders are sought in
the summons.
<P>

9   	The plaintiff's evidence is that by using his funds to
build the in-ground pool, the value of the property was enhanced.  He
suggests
that it was the intention that he have an interest in the property as a result
of this contribution.  However, there is
no evidence that the plaintiff made
any contribution of a financial nature towards the construction of the pool.
Other than the statement
in his affidavit that his funds were put to that
purpose, there is no evidence corroborating that  the moneys were spent on the
construction.
<P>

10   	The defendant requested the plaintiff  to produce evidence
of any records which would establish that any moneys that he had
were used
towards the construction of the pool.  The plaintiff was unable to produce any
documents or statements.  The plaintiff
annexed to one of his affidavits a
draft agreement which it was said was intended to reflect the intention of the
deceased and the
plaintiff.  However, neither the plaintiff nor the deceased
signed the document.  It was conceded on behalf of  the plaintiff that
no
document could be found which had the deceased's signature on it.
<P>

11   	The declaratory relief in relation to the equitable lien
was not pressed at all.  The constructive trust point was not vigorously
pressed by the plaintiff.   It was put no higher than it was something which
should be taken into account when considering the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
component of the summons.
<P>

12   	In the absence of corroborating evidence I am not prepared
to accept that whatever money the plaintiff had in 1987 it was
used for the
construction of the swimming pool on the deceased's land.  The evidence does
not disclose a common intention on behalf
of the deceased and the plaintiff.
It is difficult to see, having regard to the facts, that there was a common
intention which would
be unconscionable for the estate to deny.  In
<b>Baumgartner v Baumgartner </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%20137" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 137</a> at 148, the Court rejected
a view that a constructive trust will be imposed in accordance with
idiosyncratic notions of what is just
and fair.  In the absence of any evidence
of common intention, any order sought for a declaration of a constructive trust
must fail.
<P>

13   	The application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> is
brought on the basis that the plaintiff is an eligible person within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)(d).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6(1)(d)</a> provides as follows:
<P>

"(d)	A person:
<P>

	(i)	who was, at any particular time, wholly or partly
<P>

	dependent upon the deceased person; and
<P>

	(ii)	who is a grandchild of the deceased person or was,
<P>

	at that particular time or at any other time, a member of the 
<P>

	household of which the deceased was a member." 
<P>

14   	It was not seriously contested that a homosexual
relationship existed between the deceased and the plaintiff.   The defendant's
evidence was that the relationship commenced in about March 1987.  There was
some doubt as to whether the relationship commenced
in March 1987 or March
1988.  It appears that there were two typographical errors in the plaintiff's
affidavit of 21 November.  Only
one of those errors had been corrected in the
subsequent affidavit.  However, Guy Spagnolo's evidence in his affidavit was
that the
plaintiff and the deceased commenced living together in 1988.  Because
it is unclear when the relationship started I accept Mr Spagnolo's
evidence
(affidavit of 12 April 1999) in preference to the plaintiff's.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff's evidence was that he and the deceased had
a warm and loving relationship which involved from time to time
differences of
opinion but was basically a committed one to one relationship.  It was also a
sexual relationship.  There is evidence
that they spent  their leisure time
together and at least initially, they had a common interest in showing pedigree
dogs. 
<P>

16   	Evidence by G Spagnolo sworn on 12 April 1999 is to the
effect that the plaintiff and the deceased commenced to live at the
deceased's
house as a homosexual couple.   Mr Spagnolo's evidence corroborated the
interest that the plaintiff and the deceased had
in dog breeding and showing.
He also corroborated the plaintiff's evidence that most of their leisure time
was spent together.
<P>

17   	In cross-examination, the defendant did not really deny
the homosexual relationship between the deceased, her brother, and
the
plaintiff.  She admitted that the brother was a very private person.  In her
evidence she stated that even one week before his
death he didn't  tell her
that he had contracted AIDS.
<P>

18   	In <b>Benny v Jones (</b>Young J - 13 February 1990,
unreported) his Honour said that three things needed to be considered where
there was a homosexual relationship.
 First, whether the plaintiff was wholly
or partly dependent on the deceased.  Secondly, whether the two men were of the
same household,
and thirdly, other factors warranting.
<P>

19   	 <b>(1) 	Whether the plaintiff was wholly or partly
dependent on the deceased.</b>
<P>

20   	The plaintiff's evidence was that from the time he
commenced cohabitation and throughout the relationship he paid no rent
or board
and the deceased paid most of the cost of food and household expenses.  The
plaintiff met his own personal expenses and
otherwise contributed as he was
able.  Both he and the deceased shared the household tasks, although according
to the plaintiff,
most of those tasks were performed by him.
<P>

21   	During the relationship the deceased remained in full-time
employment and the plaintiff worked casually about three days a
week.  This was
a work pattern that had existed prior to the plaintiff entering into the
relationship with the deceased.  His evidence
was that for some time prior to
his relationship with the deceased he had worked about three days per week.
During their relationship
the plaintiff conceded that the deceased provided
most of the funds.  He paid all household accounts, food bills, expenses
relating
to the property, car and travel expenses including registration costs.
He also paid the legal fees in relation to a charge concerning
a drug offence
in which the plaintiff was not convicted.  In return, the plaintiff did most of
the household cleaning, washing, looking
after the in-ground pool, household
maintenance, gardening and general handyman jobs and cared for the dogs in the
deceased's absence.
<P>

22   	G Spagnolo's evidence, in his affidavit of 12 April 1999,
was that the deceased had often complained about the plaintiff never
paying
board or rent and not being able to contribute to pay all the bills of the
household.   However, from Mr Spagnolo's observations,
the plaintiff did work
around the house, such things as building a fence and the swimming pool and
deck.  In relation to the swimming
pool, I accept that as being no more than
assisting with work around the pool.
<P>

23   	In cross-examination, the plaintiff agreed that his
pre-relationship work habits continued into the relationship.  He conceded
that
the money that he earned was by and large spent on himself.  He stated that the
deceased supported him.  In <b>Benny v Jones </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 559</a>, the Court
of Appeal adopted what was said in <b>Ball v Newey </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 489.</a>
Dependency must have a financial element.  Given both the financial type of
dependency and the sexual relationship, the extent of
the moral obligation to
make provision could well be affected by the nature of the sexual relationship.
In <b>Mackenzie v Baddeley (</b>Court of Appeal - 3 December 1991, unreported)
it was said the phrase "partly dependent" doesn't mean substantially, it
suggests more
than minimally or significantly.
<P>

24   	In <b>Petrohilas v Hunter </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 343</a> at 346,
the Court said, "The dependence (financial) flows from the fact that
accommodation, food, clothing and other necessities
or amenities of life are
provided by the person who owns or is otherwise entitled to the accommodation
and pays for the other things."
 In <b>Kauri Timber Company (Tasmania) Pty Ltd
v Reeman </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20128%20CLR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 128 CLR 177</a> at 188-189, "one person is dependent on another
for support if the former in fact depends on the latter for support even though
he
does not need to do so and could have provided some or all of his
necessities from other sources."   In <b>Howard v Andrews </b>  (Master
Macready - 31 July 1998, unreported) at p 11, the Master said, "It is not to
the point that each of them might have been
able to live their own separate
lives.  It is more a matter of how they chose to live their lives and in the
present case there was
clearly an emotional and a part economic dependence by
the plaintiff on the deceased."
<P>

25   	On the evidence, in my view, it is clear that there was a
dependence by the plaintiff on the deceased.  That the plaintiff's
work habits
had not changed since he commenced the relationship with the deceased in my
view doesn't take the matter very far.  True
it is that those work patterns
which existed prior to the relationship appeared to be sufficient to enable the
plaintiff to live
and meet his commitments and in fact it would seem that the
work pattern hasn't changed up to the time of making the application.
Nevertheless in my view there was a dependency on the deceased.  That
dependency was in part financial through the provision of food
and
accommodation.  It was in part emotional.  Evidence has been put on which has
not been contradicted by the defendant that there
was a commitment to each
other.  I am therefore satisfied that the plaintiff was partly dependent on the
deceased.  
<P>

26   	<b>(2)	The Court must determine whether the two men were
of the same household.</b>  
<P>

27   	In <b>Maloney v Goodwin </b> (Needham, J - 1 August 1989,
unreported) his Honour said that before one can have a household one had to
have a quasi family unit.
 In <b>Munro v Lake </b> (McLelland, J - 8 February
1991, unreported) his Honour said the concept of membership of a household
connotes a degree of continuity
and permanency of mutual living arrangements.
In <b>Markulin v Drew</b> (1993) DFC 95-140, Young J said, "For the purpose of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> provided there is in fact a household and that the
plaintiff has some intimate connection with the householder or another member
of the household even though the plaintiff does not fall into the category of a
quasi wife or quasi child ...   When I use the words
`intimate connection' I do
not limit that to persons with whom there is a sexual relationship.  The bond
between them however, must
be quasi familial or that of friendship rather than
that of landlord and boarder."
<P>

28   	The plaintiff's evidence is that they conducted their
affairs in such a manner they can be  regarded as a couple.  The deceased
provided most of the money to the relationship.  Each shared the household
chores although the plaintiff's evidence was that he performed
the majority of
that work.  He gave evidence that he did most of  the cleaning, the washing,
looking after the in-ground pool, household
maintenance, gardening, handyman
jobs and cared for the deceased's dogs in his absence.  They lived in this
condition for a period
of approximately seven years.  They were known to
friends as companions and lovers and there were mutual friends who were aware
of
their relationship.
<P>

29   	There was in their relationship continuity and permanency
of living arrangements.  There was that intimate connection referred
to by
Young J in <b>Markulin v Drew </b>(supra).  In my view both men were of the
same household.
<P>

30   	<b>(3)	Other Factors.</b>
<P>

31   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9</a> of the Act differentiates between eligible
persons in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the definition of eligible person and
those defined
in paragraphs (a) and (b).  The section makes the following
provision:
<P>

"(1)	Where an application is made for an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> by an eligible person
who was such a person by reason only of paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition
of `eligible person' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)</a>, the court shall first determine whether, in its
opinion, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (whether past or
present),
there are factors which warrant the making of an application and
shall refuse to proceed with the determination of the application
and to make
the order unless it is satisfied that there are those factors."
<P>

32   	The test to be applied is that stated by McLelland J in
<b>Re Fulop </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 9 NSWLR 679</a> at 681, "The `factors' referred to... are
factors which when added to facts which render the applicant a `eligible
person' give him
or her the status of a person who would be generally regarded
as a natural object of testatmentary recognition by the deceased."
 
<P>

33   	The factors warranting making the application include the
nature of the relationship, the length of the relationship, the
conduct of the
parties in a relationship towards each other.
<P>

34   	Between March 1988 and June 1994 the evidence is that this
was a close and warm relationship.  The parties had mutual friends,
they had a
common interest at least initially.  They worked together in various capacities
in that relationship.  The deceased was
the primary bread winner.  The
plaintiff the primary house-carer.  This period was as period of some six
years.  In June 1994 the
plaintiff went to Queensland where he stayed until the
end of November of that year.  His evidence was that he needed a break.  It
is
unclear from his evidence whether the need for that break was because of any
problem with the relationship or because of some
other factor.  Nevertheless,
in October of that year the deceased joined him in Queensland for a holiday for
12 days.  Subsequently,
at the end of November the plaintiff returned to the
Galston property and the parties continued their relationship until September
1995.
<P>

35   	There is evidence that in July 1995 the plaintiff had an
operation.  As a result of that operation he became depressed and
the deceased
recommended that he return to Queensland to recuperate.  This he did.  The
intention was, according to the plaintiff,
that on retirement the deceased
would join him sometime in November 1995 and they would continue to live in
Cairns.  It seems to
me on the evidence it is difficult to say that the
relationship lasted beyond September 1995.  With one partner living 3000 km
from
the other it is difficult to see how that constitutes being of the same
household and partial dependency on the deceased.
<P>

36   	Once the plaintiff had resumed cohabitation with the
deceased in November 1994, the nature and quality of the relationship
must be
put into question.  There appears to have been nothing unremarkable in the
relationship up until July 1995.  However, the
plaintiff spent some time
recuperating at his father's property, not with the deceased.  There is no
evidence of what assistance
the deceased gave to the plaintiff once the
plaintiff resumed living at the Galston property.  It seems rather strange that
the two
people to be in a deep and committed relationship for one to suggest to
the other that he goes away to enable him to recuperate.
 It also doesn't
suggest that the relationship had any future when the deceased took no steps to
resume the relationship in November
1995.  The reasons given by the deceased
for not moving to Cairns were that his favourite dog had died and that he had
shingles.
 However, it may well be that by November the deceased was aware that
he was ill.
<P>

37   	Mr Spagnolo, in his evidence, noted that in November 1995
the deceased did not look well and had been losing weight.  It may
well be that
if he was aware of his illness, he did not want to resume the relationship.
Certainly that is an inference that one
can draw from the Christmas card sent
in 1995.  The endorsement by the deceased on the Christmas card was not in
loving terms;  it
was more in the nature of friendship.  There is no commitment
or strong emotional attachment in the phrasing of the note.  However,
by that
stage the deceased may have been aware that he had contracted AIDS.  The
difficulty is that there is no evidence on this
and it is mere speculation.
The facts, however, are that the deceased did not move to Cairns, he did not
renew the relationship and
he did not tell the plaintiff that he had contracted
AIDS until the day of his death.  Therefore, in my view the evidence suggests
that the relationship had ended by September 1995.
<P>

38   	However, in considering whether there are any factors
warranting the making of the application one needs to consider the quality
of
the relationship over the six and a half years that they were together.
<P>

39   	In my view, because of the length of the relationship and
because of the commitment to one another during that period in time,
there are
factors warranting which would lead one to regard the plaintiff as a natural
object of testamentary recognition by the
deceased.
<P>

40   	The next question is whether or not there had been
adequate provision made in favour of the plaintiff by the deceased either
during his lifetime or out of his estate because no provision was made by the
deceased who died without making a will.  His estate
under the intestacy
provisions goes to his sister.  It is clear then that no adequate provision was
made for the proper maintenance,
education and advancement in life of the
plaintiff.
<P>

41   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 9</a> sub-section (3) requires the Court to take into
consideration a number of matters.  Contributions of a financial and
non-financial
nature made by the eligible person;  in this case there is
evidence that the plaintiff provided services in relation to the conservation
and improvement of the deceased's property.  There is some evidence which
suggests that some of the work performed by the plaintiff
was faulty.
Agricultural pipes were laid too close to the surface of the soil and tiles
were put on walls in a manner which was substandard
workmanship.  However, the
plaintiff's evidence is that he performed tasks around the property and there
has been no evidence or
no contradiction of the plaintiff's evidence except to
a minor degree that what he did was not of benefit to the deceased.
<P>

42   	There is evidence concerning his contribution as a
homemaker.  That evidence was largely unchallenged and I accept the plaintiff's
evidence in that respect.  
<P>

43   	There was no evidence of conduct disentitling during the
relevant period.  The plaintiff and the deceased appeared to have
a loving and
warm relationship where there was shared leisure time and shared interests. 
<P>

44   	The plaintiff is currently a bar attendant at the Reef
Hotel Casino in Cairns.  His net weekly wage is $362.20.  His most
recent
affidavit, that is, the affidavit of 24 September 1999, gives no details of his
weekly expenses.  His affidavit of 21 November
1997 sets out at paragraph 27
his weekly expenses.  They total $274.  In that affidavit his weekly earnings,
after tax, were $343.
 In the absence of any updating information, I will
assume that his currently weekly expenses are in the vicinity of $275.  He has
an excess of income over expenditure of $88 a week.  The plaintiff is still not
working a five day week.  There is therefore potential
to increase his income,
although not necessarily increase his expenditure. 
<P>

45   	In the most recent affidavit his assets are valued at just
under $17,000.  Amongst those assets is a 1987 Magna motor sedan
given by the
deceased to the plaintiff.  The value attributed to the motor vehicle was
$1,000. 
<P>

46   	The plaintiff's evidence, in relation to his needs is not
very detailed.  In his earlier affidavit there is no mention of
any specific
need.  In his most recent affidavit he states that he desires to return to
Sydney to live which will please his father
and allow him to be with his
friends.  He also wants to find a position in Sydney in the hospitality
industry and he feels that by
coming to Sydney he has better prospects of
promotion and has a career path.  His needs, according to his evidence, relate
to the
move to Sydney and therefore accommodation.  His evidence is that he
would like to purchase a unit in the inner city area.  There
is some evidence
put on in relation to the price of units in the Paddington/Chippendale area.
Those units range from $159,000 to
$199,000.   Some of his evidence in
cross-examination was a little contradictory of his desire to live in the inner
city area.  When
questioned about his father, he said he would like
accommodation in Sydney near his father.  His father lives at Mona Vale.  I
would
not regard Paddington or Chippendale as being close to Mona Vale.
<P>

<b>COMPETING NEEDS</b>
<P>

47   	It is, of course, necessary to look at any competing needs
when determining what provision should be made out of the estate.
 The estate
has a net value of approximately $285,000.  The deceased died intestate.  His
sister is therefore the only person who
is entitled to the assets of the estate
subject to an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.
<P>

48   	The deceased's sister is the defendant in these
proceedings.  On 6 November of this year, she will be 59.  She is currently
working for George Weston Foods Ltd six days a week and earning $451.19 net per
week.  Her expenses are approximately $465 per week.
 There is, therefore, on
her evidence, a shortfall of some $14.  She owns a unit in Queanbeyan which is
valued at $88,000 but subject
to a mortgage of $33,000.  She has assets of
approximately $123,000 and liabilities of approximately $47,000 giving her net
assets
of approximately $76,000.
<P>

49   	She sustained an injury at work in 1988 and as a result of
that injury, still suffers pain to her back and legs and has to
take pain
killers from time to time.  There is no evidence that any claim has been made
on her behalf in relation to the work related
accident.  At 59, she has a
limited working life.   She still has a mortgage of $33,000 on her unit.  Her
evidence is that the unit
is small and doesn't enable her to have her
grandchildren stay with her.  A provision from her brother's estate would
enable her
to buy a house in Queanbeyan in the range of $146,000 to $167,000.
The acquisition of such a property would enable her to have her
grandchildren
with her from time to time.
<P>

50   	A concern must be the mortgage on the unit.  Relying on
her own resources it would seem that it will be very difficult for
her to pay
out the mortgage.  Some time in the foreseeable future she will be either
working a reduced number of days, she hopes
five days per week, or she will
have retired.  At that age she would find it very hard to find other
employment.  The future for
the defendant then is that her income would reduce
the ability to fund the mortgage therefore must be questionable.  
<P>

51   	The deceased has not made any provision for the plaintiff.
The deceased did not leave a will.  The estate has sufficient assets
for
provision to be made for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff is an eligible person
and in my view, satisfies the requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9(1)</a> and (3).  The question is
what provision ought to be made from the estate of the deceased for the
plaintiff?
<P>

52   	As I have already said, I believe that between 1988 and
1994 the deceased and the plaintiff had a relationship which could
be described
as warm, loving and close.  However, from July 1995 that appears to have
changed.  Certainly from September 1995 onwards
it could not be said that the
plaintiff was a part of the household of the deceased, nor could it be said
that the plaintiff was
wholly or partly dependent on the deceased.  The
requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)(d)</a> therefore from September 1995 are absent.  
<P>

53   	On the evidence, on the balance of probabilities, it is
difficult to say that the relationship would have recommenced.  Had
the
relationship still been a strong, caring and loving relationship, it is
difficult to see why the deceased suggested to the plaintiff
that his
recuperation take place 3000 km away.  Likewise, if the deceased still felt
strongly about the plaintiff, it is difficult
to understand why he didn't
confide in the plaintiff about contracting AIDS.
<P>

54   	In my view it would appear that the relationship was over.
 At the time the deceased died, it could not be said that there
was a loving
and caring relationship.  That appeared to have ended some months beforehand.
I am not satisfied, on the plaintiff's
evidence, that notwithstanding the
deceased had contracted AIDS that he had any intention of living permanently in
North Queensland
with the plaintiff. Therefore, in that context, any provision
that should be made for the plaintiff has to be considered with those
matters
in mind.  Although the relationship was a loving and caring relationship, it
lasted only approximately six years.
<P>

55   	The evidence of the defendant was that she was close to
her brother.  They were in regular contact and they saw each other
from time to
time.  However, it transpired that they saw each other perhaps no more than
once or twice a year and the evidence about
their telephone contact was fairly
inconclusive.  Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that she had her family
in Queanbeyan and
he had his life in Sydney.  There was nothing in the evidence
which suggested that  there was any animosity between brother and sister.
Their relationship was no different than that of many other Australians.  They
lived in different cities;  they had different interests,
although they did
share interest in the dogs.  She had a family.  His involvement outside of his
dogs was in an area completely different
to that of his sister. Therefore,
nothing suggests that their relationship was out of the ordinary.
<P>

56   	The legislation makes provision based on relationships to
the deceased under the intestacy provisions.  The closest relationship
is that
of surviving spouse followed by children and siblings of the full blood.  The
defendant was the closest relative to the deceased.
 That needs to be borne in
mind when considering what provision should be made for the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>PLAINTIFF'S NEEDS</b> 
<P>

57   	The plaintiff's relationship with the deceased was loving
and caring which lasted for approximately six years and that could
not be
regarded as a long relationship.   It is in that context that provision for the
plaintiff is made.  His evidence as to his
needs is not given with any
conviction.  After four years he now decides Sydney is where he should be.
Part of the reason is given
he wants to further his career in the hospitality
industry, part of the reason is to be close to his father, and another reason
is
that he wants to return to Sydney because most of his friends live in
Sydney.  In his affidavit he states that he would like to purchase
a unit in
the inner city area.  In cross-examination his evidence was that he would like
to be near his father.  It is not really
clear what the plaintiff wants.  It is
certainly not clear what the plaintiff's needs are.  A number of the matters he
has raised
seem to me to be things that have been considered in haste and are
probably no more than wants or desires, rather than needs.
<P>

58   	The relationship was not so enduring that the estate
should provide the plaintiff with accommodation.  In my view, the estate
should
make provision to some degree for the plaintiff's proper maintenance, education
and advancement in life.  He has not made
any attempt to move to Sydney and it
is doubtful whether that will in fact happen.  His income exceeds his
expenditure by approximately
$88 a week.  He is not working full-time.  It
seems to me that he has the capacity to earn more money, but in earning more
money
it doesn't necessarily follow that his expenses will greatly increase.
Should he desire to come to Sydney to improve his prospects
he will obviously
need some form of accommodation.  He is a person who whilst never having been
in full-time employment, has never
been unemployed either.  He is still
relatively young.  Were he to come to Sydney I do not think he is likely to
have trouble finding
employment.  If he can find employment in his chosen
occupation his career path may expand.  Provision should be made from the
estate
to give the plaintiff the opportunity to purchase some form of
accommodation.  In my view, an appropriate amount for the plaintiff
would be
$55,000.
<P>

<b>ORDER</b> 
<P>

59   	Therefore, the order that I make is that the plaintiff
receive a legacy from the estate of the deceased in the sum of $55,000.
 The
estate pay the plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis;   the estate pay
the defendant's costs on an indemnity basis.
<P>

60   	After the reasons for the decision were drafted I received
a letter from Snedden Hall &amp; Gallop dated 30 September 1999.
 I read the
letter but its contents did not have a bearing on my decision.
