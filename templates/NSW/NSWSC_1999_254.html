<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>22 March 1999</b>
<P>

1	The only novel feature of the scheme of arrangement and associated reduction
of capital presently before me relates to the effect
of recent amendments to
the <i>Corporations Law</i> brought down in 1998 dealing with reductions of
capital. These amendments in the form of ss256B and C, now define "equal
reductions".
This is on the basis that any capital reduction that is not an
equal reduction is a "selective reduction", with the former no longer
required
to be by special resolution.
<P>

2	Prior to these amendments it was often unclear the precise point at which the
reduction of capital ceased its work and an associated
scheme of arrangement
took over. It was however well settled that a scheme of arrangement was needed
wherever the reduction of capital
involves the shareholder being compelled to
acquire shares (<i>Re Hunter Resources Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/133.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 133</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2034%20FCR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 34 FCR 418</a> where the
shares, as here, were in another company), and a scheme was thus employed for
that purpose, overlapping with the reduction.
The present proposal involves
just these features, but the amended legislation requires more precise
differentiation between scheme
and reduction, for reasons I will explain.
<P>

3	The present proposal before me might be thought to involve a reduction of
capital by way of transfer of shares owned by the company
effecting the
reduction. (There is also the usual provision for shareholders with foreign
addresses having their pro rata allocation
of shares allotted or transferred to
a nominee for sale and the proceeds accounted for to the shareholder with the
foreign address.)
However, that characterisation would not be an accurate
statement of what in fact is brought about by the reduction of capital. The
reduction of capital in legal terms allocates cash pro rata according to the
formula in the documentation. Only after that, and solely
by force of the
scheme, that cash is required to be applied in purchasing ICM shares previously
acquired by the scheme company, ETRADE
Australia Limited. The two steps are
telescoped, so that the shareholder never physically receives the cash, but
they remain conceptually
distinct.
<P>

4	In those circumstances, there is clearly enough what s256B(2) defines as an
"equal reduction". That is to say, the reduction relates
only to ordinary
shares including those created by virtue of the exercise of pre-existing
options, it applies in proportion to the
number of ordinary shares held and
"the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of ordinary shares".
Being thus an equal
reduction, it may now be effected merely by an ordinary
resolution.
<P>

5	Had the reduction not been within that definition of equal reduction, it
would be deemed to be a "selective reduction". As a selective
reduction,
s256C(2) would apply and is in these terms:
<P>

"<b>256C	(2)	Special shareholder approval for selective reduction</b>  If the
reduction is an equal reduction, it must be approved by either:
<P>

(a)	a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no
votes being cast in favour of the resolution by any
person who is to receive
consideration as part of the reduction or whose liability to pay amounts unpaid
on shares is to be reduced,
or by their associates; or
<P>

(b)	a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary
shareholders.
<P>

If the reduction involves the cancellation of shares, the reduction must also
be approved by a special resolution passed at a meeting
of the shareholders
whose shares are to be cancelled.
<P>

6	The effect of that definition in the present circumstances would have been to
give rise to the absurdity that in practical terms
the necessary resolution
could not have been passed unless there were total unanimity, inviting
corporate blackmail. This is because
no shareholder could vote under paragraph
(a) - as all shareholders receive consideration as part of the reduction. That
renders
paragraph (b) applicable, requiring unanimity of all ordinary
shareholders at the meeting. Even one dissenting shareholder could
thus scuttle
the proposal. Attention should be given by the legislature to this anomaly. It
arises wherever you have all shareholders
of a class receiving consideration,
but some even minor differentiation precluding the terms of the reduction being
precisely the
same.
<P>

7	There is nothing in the other matters before me which prevents my making the
necessary orders to convene the necessary meetings.
