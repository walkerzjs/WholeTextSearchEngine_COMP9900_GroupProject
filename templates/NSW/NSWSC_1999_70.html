<b>JUDGMENT  (Particulars of comment &amp; qualified privilege - justification
- contextual imputations - capacity &amp; form)</b>
<P>

1	This matter which is not unconnected with matter numbers 16709/91, 20701/94
and 20930/94 has been the subject of the following
rulings and judgments:  Dowd
J 27 November 1995;  Levine J 30 November 1995; and, Studdert J 5 June 1996.
<P>

2	The plaintiff filed his Statement of Claim on 29 November 1994 and sues on
three publications.
<P>

3	The first publication (1 October 1994) is said to convey of the plaintiff the
following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"3(a)	the plaintiff has behaved dishonestly in his capacity as an officer
of the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by falsely
attributing to the
first defendant responsibility for the Manager's poor performance;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiff has behaved incompetently in his capacity as an officer
of the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the plaintiff has behaved improperly as an officer of the Manager of
the Estate Mortgage Trusts by charging exorbitant fees for
Managerial
services;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	the plaintiff has behaved dishonestly in his capacity as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by publishing
a press release on 27
June 1994 which he knew to be false;</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	the plaintiff as an officer of the Manager of the Estate Mortgage
Trusts has knowingly participated in a breach of duty by the
Manager by selling
a number of properties to Mercantile Mutual at a gross undervalue solely for
the purpose of safeguarding the interests
of the Manager;</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	the plaintiff has acted fraudulently in his capacity as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by publishing
a statement on page 27
of the November 1991 Report which he knew to be false;</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)	the plaintiff has acted dishonestly in his capacity as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by authorising
the payment of
excessive fees to Mr John Murphy out of trust funds while knowing such fees
were unjustifiable;</i>
<P>

<i>	(h)	the plaintiff is dishonest;</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the plaintiff is a person of extremely low intelligence;</i>
<P>

<i>	(j)	the plaintiff knowingly told a deliberate falsehood in relation to
statements made by the first defendant in the letter of 20
June 1994;</i>
<P>

<i>	(k)	the plaintiff is untrustworthy;</i>
<P>

<i>	(l)	the plaintiff is reasonably suspected of receiving secret commissions
in respect of the sale of Estate Mortgage Trust properties;</i>
<P>

<i>	(m)	the plaintiff is reasonably suspected of having engaged in malpractice
in his capacity as an officer of the Manager of the Estate
Mortgage
Trusts;</i>
<P>

<i>	(n)	the plaintiff is reasonably suspected of acting contrary to his duties
as an officer of the manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts
by appointing a
manager in return for personal benefits".</i>
<P>

4	The second publication of the plaintiff was on 2 October 1994 and it is said
to convey the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"5(a)	the plaintiff has behaved improperly in his capacity as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by breaking
a promise he made to
unitholders in 1994;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiff has behaved improperly in his capacity as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by charging exorbitant
fees from the
unitholders;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the plaintiff has behaved improperly in his capacity as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by publishing
a booklet in which he
attempted to deceive unitholders".</i>
<P>

5	The third publication on 22 October 1994 is said to covey the following
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"9 (sic)</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the plaintiff is reasonably suspected of malfeasance as an officer of
the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts in that he was
knowingly involved in
entry by the Manager into joint venture deals which were of personal benefit to
the plaintiff and contrary
to the interests of the unitholders;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiff has fraudulently misappropriated one million dollars of
the funds of the Estate Mortgage Trusts while acting as
an officer of the
Manager of those trusts".</i>
<P>

6	The defendants have raised defences of comment, privilege, justification
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> and contextual justification under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act,
1974</a></i>.
<P>

7	In response to the plaintiff's pleading of 14 imputations arising from the
matter complained of, the defendants plead in paragraph
11 of the Defence an
immodest 32 contextual imputations.
<P>

8	In answer to the three imputations pleaded by the plaintiff in respect of the
second matter complained of the defendants pleads
13 contextual imputations.
<P>

9	In answer to the two imputations pleaded as arising from the third
publications sued upon, the defendants plead four contextual
imputations.
<P>

10	Appearances are deceptive;  the position is not as bad as it looks because
it was conceded by Mr Evatt for the defendants that
the following contextual
imputations are abandoned:  11(a) (i) - (xv) (inclusive);  12(a)(i) - (iii);
and, 13(a)(i).
<P>

11	Thus, in relation to the defence of contextual truth to the first
publication the defendants rely upon the following contextual
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"11(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(xvi)	The plaintiff is dishonest because he endeavoured to shift the blame
for Global's poor performance on to the first defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xvii)	The plaintiff is grossly incompetent because he estimated a profit
for Global of $61.6 million when its actual profit was
$2.41 million in
1994.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xviii)	The plaintiff conducted himself in such manner that he duped John
Murphy.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xix)	The plaintiff is incompetent because while Managing Director of
Global its assets decreased from $2666.6 million to $168.4
million.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xx)	The plaintiff's fees were excessive.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxi)	The plaintiff conducted himself in such manner as to warrant an
allegation that he proposed to acquiesce in an unsatisfactory
settlement with
Burns Philp.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxii)	The plaintiff conducted himself in such manner as to warrant the
request for an independent inquiry to investigate Global's
relationship with
Mercantile Mutual.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxiii)	The plaintiff conducted himself in such manner as to warrant the
request for an independent inquiry into Global's debacle
in respect of its
diminished assets.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxiv)	The plaintiff was so incompetent that he sold properties to
Mercantile Mutual worth several times more than the amount paid.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxv)	The plaintiff deceived unit holders by failing to reveal that his
justification of excessive fees of $4 million a year was
based on a false
comparison to similar fees charged by Estate Mortgage Managers because he did
not disclose that these Managers managed
assets of over one billion dollars
whereas the plaintiff managed assets a fraction of this sum.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxvi)	The plaintiff improperly acts against the best interest of unit
holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxvii)	The plaintiff conducted himself in such manner he warranted being
rebuked by the NSW Health Minister over statements in the
prospectus issued by
Global.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxviii)	The plaintiff connived at John Murphy being paid excessive
fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxix)	The plaintiff is incompetent.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxx)	The plaintiff sold properties at a loss to finance his excessive
fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxxi)	The plaintiff unjustifiably opposes the proposals made by or on
behalf of the first defendant as set out in annexure `A'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xxxii)	The plaintiff has acted unreasonably in opposing the first
defendant's proposals as set out in annexure `A'".</i>
<P>

12	In relation to the second matter complained of, the defendants rely upon the
following contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"12(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiff had improperly attempted to stop any move to reduce
Global's excessive fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiff is dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiff is incompetent.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiff improperly collects more than double what would be paid
to any other comparable Manager or Trustee.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The plaintiff together with John Murphy sells the property of unit
holders in order to pay for their excessive fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	The plaintiff is a hypocrite.</i>
<P>

<i>	(x)	The plaintiff attempted to deceive unit holders by covering up a
trading loss.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xi)	The plaintiff is so incompetent that the profit of $2.14 million set
out in the annual report of 1994 which he prepared is actually
a trading loss
of $2.782 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xii)	The plaintiff unjustifiably opposes the proposals made by or on
behalf of the first defendant as set out in annexure `B'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xiii)	The plaintiff has acted unreasonably in opposing the first
defendant's proposals as set out in annexure `B'".</i>
<P>

13	In relation to third matter complained of, the defendants rely upon the
following contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"13(a) ... </i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiff deliberately used an accounting system designed to
deceive unit holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiff is incompetent.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiff is dishonest".</i>
<P>

14	In my judgments in <b><i>Tyndall Funds Management Australia Limited
(formerly Global Funds Management Australia Limited) &amp; Anor  v Hari Bhagat
&amp; Anor</i></b>  (20930/94); <b><i>Tyndall Funds Management Australia
Limited (formerly Global Funds Management Australia Limited) &amp; Anor  v
Pamela Ann Mesh &amp;
2 Ors</i></b> (20701/94); and <b><i>Tyndall Funds
Management (NSW) Limited (formerly Global Funds Management (NSW) Limited) &amp;
Anor  v Pamela Ann Mesh &amp; Anor</i></b> (16709/91) I have dealt with the
uniform complaints made by the plaintiffs in relation to the deficiency of
particulars of comment
and qualified privilege.  I will not rehearse them.  I
will order the defendants to provide full and proper particulars in answer
to
requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the plaintiff's solicitors letter of 7
November 1996.
<P>

15	In respect of the particulars provided in support of the pleas of
justification (and irrespective of the outcome of the plaintiff's
application
in relation to contextual imputation) the defendant is required to give
particulars of the facts, matters and circumstances
upon which they rely in
support of the truth of each imputation.  The imputations should be dealt with
separately in this regard
though it may be indicated in relation to any given
imputation to be justified that the same particulars as are provided in
relation
to another imputation are relied upon.  In other words, the defendants
are obliged to allocate to each imputation justified whether
it be the
plaintiff's imputation or a contextual imputation the relevant facts, matters
and circumstances that are going to be proved
by evidence.  The global
approach, of which the plaintiff complains, is not appropriate.
<P>

16	Accordingly, the defendants are to provide proper particulars in answer to
requests numbered 13 - 30 (inclusive) of the plaintiff's
solicitors letter of 7
November 1996.  
<P>

17	Complaint is made in relation to paragraph 6 of the Defence which purports
to refer to other documents which are said to explain
or qualify and add to the
letter complained of.  I dealt with this matter in my judgment in matter number
16709/91 and for the reasons
therein stated I will strike out paragraph 6 of
the Defence.  
<P>

18	In these proceedings Mr Caspersonn for the plaintiff raised issues in
relation to the cross-claim in matter number 20701/94.
 I make no order in
these proceedings as I have dealt with the cross-claim in my judgment in that
matter.
<P>

19	With respect to the matters raised in mitigation of damages at pages 10 and
11 of the Defence, for the reasons stated in the
other judgments in this
litigation I strike out particulars (v), (vi) and (vii).  The observations I
have made elsewhere in relation
to these matters apply here as well.
<P>

20	I return to the pleas of contextual justification.  It is submitted
generally for the plaintiff that the remaining contextual
imputations are
imprecise, failing to specify what "<i>nefarious</i>' act the plaintiff did.
They contain a wide suggestion of a great variety of conduct and each
constitutes what is described as a
package of words that mean nothing
concrete.
<P>

21	They contain concepts that are nebulous, examples being 11(a)(xviii), (xxi),
(xxii), (xxiii) and (xxvii).  Secondly, they are
rhetorical, examples being
11(a)(xiv) and 12(a)(xi).  Thirdly, the argumentative style imputations linking
back into the matter complained
of are defective in form, namely contextual
imputations 11(a)(xxxi) and (xxxii), 12(a)(xii) and (xiii).  Fourthly, the
contextual
imputations suffer from the <b><i>Drummoyne</i></b> imprecision vice
specifically contextual imputations 11(a)(xx) and (xix);  12(a)(v), (vi) and
(ix); and, 13(a)(iii) and (iv).  Further,
contextual imputations contain
additional argumentative material incorporating complex fund management fees
considerations, for example,
11(a)(xxv) and 12(a)(vii).  The use of such an
expression as "<i>the plaintiff connived at</i>" in 11(a)(xxviii) exposes a
flaw.
<P>

22	In the course of submissions reference was made to standard authorities in
relation to contextual imputations, particularly <b><i>Waterhouse v
Hickey</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) Aust. Tort Rep 81-347</a> per Priestley JA at 62,494;
<b><i>NRMA Insurance Limited v Amalgamated Television Services Pty
</i></b>(Hunt J, unreported, 14 July 1989);  <b><i>Marsden v Amalgamated
Television Services Pty Limited</i></b> (Levine J, unreported, 30 November
1995).  Bearing in mind the principles and the bases of objection one could
easily and in despair
perhaps, simply strike out the whole of the defences in
each case.  Consideration of the contextual imputations remaining however,
does
not in the end justify such a course.
<P>

23	I strike out the following remaining contextual imputations:  11(a)(xviii),
(xxi), (xxii), (xxiii), (xxvi) - (xxxii) (inclusive).
<P>

24	With respect to the contextual imputations pleaded in answer to the second
matter complained of I will strike out contextual
imputations 12(a)(iv), (v),
(vi), (vii), (ix), (xii) and (xiii). 
<P>

25	With respect to the contextual imputations remaining in answer to the third
matter complained of this is a very short document
and one must be wary of the
application with too much facility of what is known as the
<b><i>Drummoyne</i></b> principle.  However, the contextual imputation
13(a)(iv) "<i>the plaintiff is dishonest</i>" will be struck out because the
matter complained of does contain material that would amplify that notion.
However, the amplification
by reference to the material in the matter
complained of would lead to the position, I am satisfied, that a contextual
imputation
simply will not differ in substance from that pleaded by the
plaintiff.  In the end, accordingly, I strike out contextual imputations
13(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv).  
<P>

26	As Mr Caspersonn submitted the defence of truth pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> is the
appropriate defence when the contextual imputations sought to be relied upon do
not differ in substance from those pleaded
by the plaintiff.
<P>

27	In the exercise of any leave granted to replead defences under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> the
defendants should give careful consideration to not only the formalities but
also to the realities.
<P>

28	The plaintiff has overwhelmingly succeed and is entitled to the appropriate
order for costs.
<P>

29	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The defendants are to provide proper further and better particulars of the
defence of comment and qualified privilege in response
to the plaintiff's
solicitors letter of 7 November 1996 within 28 days.
<P>

2.	The defendants are to be provide, in accordance with reason reasons, proper
particulars of the facts, matters and circumstances
upon which reliance will be
placed in support of the defences of justification in answer to the plaintiff's
solicitors letter of
7 November 1996.
<P>

3.	Paragraph 6 of the defence is struck out.
<P>

4.	Particulars (v), (vi) and (vii) of the particulars of Mitigation of Damages
are struck out.
<P>

5.	The defendants are to provide proper further and better particulars of
particular (viii) of Mitigation of Damages, within 28
days.
<P>

6.	Contextual imputations 11(a)(xviii), (xxii), (xxiii) and (xvi) to (xxxii)
inclusive are struck out.
<P>

7.	Contextual imputations 12(a)(iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix), (xii) and (xiii)
are struck out.
<P>

8.	Contextual imputations 13(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv) are struck out.
<P>

9.	The defendants have leave to file an Amended Defence within 28 days.
<P>

10.	The defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

11.	At the expiry of 28 days, liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3
days notice.
