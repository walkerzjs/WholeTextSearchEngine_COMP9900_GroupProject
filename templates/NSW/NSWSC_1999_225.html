<b><u>4977/98 -  AUSTRALIAN GUARANTEE CORPORATION LTD  v  EDWIN DAVID
JOHNSON</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   The defendant by Notice of Motion filed on 1 March 1999 seeks
orders, first that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant
to Part 13 Rule 5 of
the Supreme Court Rules, and second that injunctive orders made by this Court
on 11 December 1998 and extended
on 17 December 1998 be vacated by which I
think it is meant dissolved.
<P>

2	It is convenient to deal with the application for dismissal first because
that is the main claim of the defendant.  To do that
it is necessary to look at
the substantive relief which is claimed by the plaintiff Australian Guarantee
Corporation Ltd (AGC) in
the summons. The substantive relief is for a
declaration that a certain Kenworth motor vehicle is the property of AGC and an
order
that the defendant deliver up that vehicle to the plaintiff.
<P>

3	It is conceded by the defendant that the vehicle is within his control
somewhere in North Queensland.  He refused in the witness
box to answer a
question as to the address where it was kept and I was not asked to require him
to do so.  It is really immaterial
as there is no doubt that the defendant
knows where it is and that if he can he will deliver it to an agent for
sale.
<P>

4	The plaintiff claims that the vehicle is its property. The facts which give
rise to this claim are a little difficult but in brief
can be stated as
follows.
<P>

5	The vehicle was the subject of an agreement being a Credit Contract and
Security Mortgage between the plaintiff and his former
defacto companion Janet
Duncan, and Esanda Finance Corporation Limited, (Esanda) under which that
vehicle was subject to what is
described as a "property mortgage", pursuant to
which, in consideration of Esanda lending to the then applicants the sum of
$60000
repayable on certain terms at interest rates set out, the borrowers,
namely, Mr Johnson and Miss Duncan as beneficial owners conveyed
to Esanda the
truck by way of mortgage subject to the usual proviso for redemption that
appears in this type of document.
<P>

6	It appears on the evidence at this stage that Mr Johnson and Miss Duncan
severed their relationship; that Mr Johnson had made
some arrangements with
Esanda Limited to vary the terms of the loan agreement, he having made
substantial payments under it in accordance
with its terms; that the vehicle
was stolen from him; that some days later an application was made to AGC for
finance by a company
Hasbar Pty Ltd of which a Mr Hasseldon was a director, by
way of an offer to sell that vehicle, the offer purporting to be made by
Mr
Johnson and Miss Duncan with a request to Westpac Corporation Limited,
presumably as agent of AGC, to accept the offer of sale,
such offer on
acceptance bringing into force the provisions of what seems to be described as
a Standard Asset Purchase Agreement
between the bank or AGC and Hasbar Pty
Ltd.
<P>

7	On the date that agreement was to be finalised Mr Johnson, having apparently
found out the location of the vehicle which he says
is his sole property, took
that vehicle back into his own possession where it has remained since.  On that
same day, however, AGC
paid out the monies which it had agreed to lend pursuant
to its acceptance of the offer to sell, and offer of finance, as a result
of
which $43,579.43 was paid to Esanda Finance Corporation Limited, and the
balance of $18,420.57 was paid by cheque payable to the
defendant and Miss
Duncan, which apparently was endorsed by Miss Duncan and purported to be
endorsed by Mr Johnson although his signature
was forged.  The cheque was
negotiated through a bank account for the benefit of either Miss Duncan or Mr
Hasseldon or his company.
It does not matter which.
<P>

8	It is not necessary to set out any further facts because the rights of the
parties at least at this stage depend upon the result
of the monies having been
paid to Esanda and the liability on Mr Johnson and Miss Duncan to that company
having been discharged.
<P>

9	The applicant/defendant says that AGC has no interest in the truck.  Thus, it
says, its claim under the summons must fail and
it should be struck out and
therefore the injunctive orders dissolved, which they would be automatically if
the summons were dismissed.
<P>

10	To enable an application under Part 13 Rule 5 to succeed on the basis on
which it is put, it must be shown really that the plaintiff's
claim is doomed
to fail and there is no reasonable question to be tried as to any property
interest asserted by the plaintiff in
the truck.
<P>

11	The argument of the defendant is that there can be no claim for the right of
subrogation which is asserted by AGC because AGC
made the payment to Esanda
without having been asked to do so by Mr Johnson who did not seek the benefit
of that payment from AGC,
and therefore no right can be conferred upon AGC by
reason of the unsought benefit.
<P>

12	It is, of course, correct that if goods are sold by someone who does not own
them then the purchaser, unless the  circumstances
are special, obtains no
right or title to those goods as against the owner, but that is not really the
question which arises here.
<P>

13	The applicant's claim is founded on the principles in <b><cite>Falcke v
Scottish Imperial Insurance Company</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2034%20Ch%20D%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 34 Ch D 234</a>, reliance
being placed upon the general principle enunciated by Bowen LJ in that case
that:-
<P>

work and labour done or money expended by one man to preserve or benefit the
property of another do not according to English law
create any lien upon the
property saved or benefited, nor, even if standing alone create any obligation
to repay the expenditure.
<P>

It is not suggested by the plaintiff/respondent that is not the position.
<P>

14	The case of the plaintiff is that it having paid out the mortgagee entitled
to legal ownership of the truck it is entitled to
be subrogated to the rights
that original mortgagee had.  It says that in those circumstances the
principles enunciated in <b><cite>Falcke</cite></b> have no bearing on the
matter and that the principles set forth in <b><cite>Ghana Commercial Bank v
Chandiram</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%20AC%20732" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) AC 732</a> make it clear that when a third party pays
off a mortgage or other security he is presumed to intend to keep that security
alive
for his benefit, perhaps in some cases until proper security is obtained,
and that the fact that this is done without the knowledge
or concurrence of the
borrower or mortgagor does not bear upon that right to be regarded as if an
assignment had taken place.
<P>

15	The applicant/defendant argues, that there is some discussion about this
principle in other cases concerning a volunteer as to
whether such a volunteer
is purely an intermeddler.  It is not necessary to go into this in detail other
than to say that on the
passage relied on by the defendant in Meagher Gummow
&amp; Lehane, Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies 3rd ed para 913 in no way sets
out to state the position with complete certainty.
<P>

16	Whatever the position, in my view it would be impossible to say that there
was not a serious question to be tried on the claim
which the plaintiff makes
that the vehicle is its property, although it cannot be said that the claim for
it being its property could
be otherwise than being subject to some equity in
redemption in the defendant.
<P>

17	To that extent, the relief claimed in the summons may not be entirely
appropriate but it would certainly not be correct to dismiss
the proceedings as
they stand because whether or not paragraph 1 is precisely correctly framed, it
is capable of amendment, if that
is required, and even as it  is framed it is
not possible to say that the claim that the vehicle is the property of the
plaintiff
is doomed to fail.
<P>

18	In those circumstances, the prime claim made by the defendant for the
dismissal of the action must be dismissed.
<P>

19	It is probably unnecessary to point out that the right of subrogation to
some extent flows from the desire to prevent what would
otherwise be an
unconscionable benefit going to somebody who ought not to have that benefit.
The defendant here on his own evidence
would, if he could, sell the truck and
take the whole of the proceeds of it having had his liability paid out by AGC
by mistake.
 That mistake was that it paid under the mistaken belief that it
had taken a title from those entitled to give it and thus conferred
a benefit
on the defendant which he ought not in conscience be entitled to receive.
However, that is just another matter for later
argument which shows that the
proceedings ought not to be dismissed under the rules as sought.
<P>

20	If that is the position, it is not contested that an appropriate injunction
should remain in force.  There is a question as to
what the appropriate
restraint should be.  I have stated and, as I understand it, it was accepted by
the plaintiff,  that the plaintiff
should be secured for the amount which it
paid to Esanda, namely, $43,579.43 not by payment of that amount to it out of
the proceeds
of sale but by payment of that amount into Court to abide the
final result of this hearing.  In other words, any amount received
on the sale
of the vehicle in excess of that amount ought to, so far as AGC is concerned,
go to Mr Johnson.
<P>

21	In my view an appropriate restraining order should be put in force to give
effect to that preventing the disposal of the vehicle
in a way otherwise than
on the basis that that sum be paid into Court.
<P>
