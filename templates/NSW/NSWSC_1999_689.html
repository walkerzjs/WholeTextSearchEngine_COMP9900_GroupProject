AND 2
ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>General Outline</b>
<P>

1   	Mr. Corsiatto the first defendant (Corsiatto) was employed
by one of the plaintiff companies from 1981 until 1996.  The claim
of the
plaintiffs against him is that, prior to leaving the employment and in breach
of his contract of employment or his fiduciary
duties to the plaintiff
companies, he made use of confidential material to create a client list which
he thereafter used to the detriment
of the plaintiff and for his own benefit.
It is claimed that Diana Rodwell the second defendant, with whom Corsiatto
lived in a de
facto relationship, knowingly profited from these breaches as did
DHB &amp; Associates Pty. Limited (DHB) the third defendant, Corsiatto
having
become a sub-broker of DHB after his employment with the plaintiff ceased.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	Halliday &amp; Nicholas Insurance Brokers Pty. Limited (H
&amp; N) is a licensed insurance broker.  H &amp; N Nominees Pty.
Limited
(Nominees) the second plaintiff was from 1981 until 1996 an administration
company of H &amp; N providing services to it,
including the services of
Corsiatto.  After 1 July 1996, Halnic Nominees Pty. Limited (Halnic) provided
the same services to H &amp;
N.  Corsiatto was a director of H &amp; N from
1981 until July 1995; an employee of Nominees from 1981 until 1 July 1996; of
Halnic
from 1 July 1996 until 8 October 1996.  No point is taken on these
matters.  It is accepted that any loss sustained by reason of
the activities of
the defendants or any profits for which the defendants must account should
result in an award in favour of H &amp;
N and that nothing turns on the fact of
employment by an administration company.  Thus I will refer to the plaintiff in
the singular
and generally as H &amp; N.
<P>

3   	Rodwell was employed by either Nominees or Halnic from 1988
until 3 August 1996 when she was dismissed.  It is clear that there
was a
cooling off in the employment relationship between Corsiatto and Halliday
before this which was hastened when Rodwell left
and that thereafter Corsiatto
decided that he would leave.  I find that he discussed the possibility of
leaving at an earlier date
with Mr. Beveridge of DHB at an AMP function, but I
find there to be no significance in that.  One of the plaintiff's claims that
Corsiatto made out a list of the more important clients of H &amp; N allocated
to him some time earlier in 1996 and took that list
with him when he left or
used it to constitute a new list, was not made out to my satisfaction.
<P>

4   	Corsiatto was employed as what is called an account
executive.  He was by 1996 responsible for the insurance needs of about
450
clients of H &amp; N.  He was the most senior employee of the plaintiff.  He
was a sole signatory on the office bank account
and a joint signatory on the
premiums account, which is really a trust account.  He was clearly well
regarded, although Mr. Halliday
thought his performance was deteriorating.
<P>

5   	Prior to his employment terminating, Corsiatto visited
certain H &amp; N clients with whom he dealt, telling them of his concern
about
the way Rodwell had been treated and telling some of them that he intended
leaving.  It is perfectly clear that in part this
was in preparation for a
move.  No doubt these actions were a breach of his contract of employment, but
no actual damage is shown
to have flowed from this and no benefit to him to
have flowed from it.  In fact the evidence is to the contrary. 
<P>

6   	Some time in September 1996 Corsiatto informed Mr.
Beveridge of DHB that he was leaving and inquired about the possibility
of
joining DHB in some capacity.  No final arrangements were made, but certainly
Mr. Beveridge knew of his intentions and asked him
to get in touch with him
when he had made up his mind.  Corsiatto had made a firm decision to leave H
&amp; N at least by the last
week in September 1996, as he had by then
purchased a new mobile telephone and a new car, both of which were available to
him as
part of his contract of employment with H &amp; N.
<P>

7   	On 30 September 1996 Mr. Timothy Rodwell, the son of the
second defendant, assisted Corsiatto in producing a list of clients
of H &amp;
N, the responsibility of Corsiatto.  At least one purpose of this was to enable
a circular letter to be produced and sent
to those clients after cessation of
employment, advising them of his resignation.  The letter did not in terms seek
to obtain the
further business of those clients, and indeed said they could
expect to be contacted by H &amp; N.  However, it did give an address
and phone
number of Corsiatto.
<P>

8   	According to Corsiatto the lists were made up from the
combination of business cards which he had from clients and an address
book he
kept, a road directory, the telephone book and his memory.  He later explained
some groupings of a list which accorded with
groupings on the H &amp; N client
list, by his remembering the position of the files in the H &amp; N filing
system and his own good
memory.  I do not accept the explanation of Corsiatto.
Even after a long period of employment and familiarity with clients and their
files, the identical wording of many of the listings makes it impossible to
find other than Corsiatto made his list in substantial
part by use of material
from the H &amp; N files available to him during his period of employment.  I
did not find him an impressive
witness.  I did not think his explanation
acceptable or indeed possible.  I do not consider it would have been possible
for the computer
lists compiled by Mr. Rodwell from lists provided to him by
Corsiatto to have come out in the form which they did with names set
out of
companies and individuals as they were, some with "Mr.", some without, some
with initials, some with full names, some with
post office box addresses,
corresponding precisely with those in the H &amp; N records, by doing this as
Corsiatto said that it was
done.  I find that he was preparing to leave and
while doing so made use of the information from files of H &amp; N,
confidential
to that company in completing his lists.  I do not find that he
either took or retained a copy of the H &amp; N client list.
<P>

9   	On 8 October 1996 Corsiatto gave notice and left.  He
proceeded to DHB.  It was agreed that he would be allowed to work from
there
from that date although no sub-broker agreement was entered into until
November.  However, it seems to have been agreed that
commissions received from
clients introduced to DHB would be shared as to 80% to him and 20% to DHB.  
<P>

10   	The letter which Corsiatto sent to nearly all of the
clients of H &amp; N for whom he was responsible up to leaving was sent
on 9
October 1996, having been hand dated prior to it being sent.  It was seen by
Mr. Beveridge, who knew it was intended to send
it out. 
<P>

11   	After that Corsiatto contacted most if not all of those
persons and succeeded in obtaining new appointments from many of them,
under
which DHB was nominated as new agent, enabling DHB through Corsiatto to obtain
access to the insurance information of those
clients from their insurers.  As a
result of these appointments substantial commissions flowed to DHB and through
DHB to Corsiatto.
 The amount earned by DHB for the year ended 30 June 1997 was
in the order of $21,000 and for the year ended 30 June 1998 in the
order of
$80,000, Corsiatto getting 80 percent of those amounts.  As a lot of insurances
become due on 30 June and commission presumably
is payable shortly thereafter,
that could account in part for the relatively small amount for the period after
October 1996 until
June 1997.
<P>

12   	After October 1996, Mrs. Rodwell carried out some
improvements to her home.  Some of these were paid for by her charging certain
items to the American Express credit account of Corsiatto, which she was
authorised to do, which liability was later discharged by
Corsiatto at least
partly with funds flowing from his share of the commissions.
<P>

<b>Pleaded Claims</b>
<P>

13   	The claim against Corsiatto is that as a senior employee
of the plaintiff he was under a fiduciary duty to it to maintain
the
confidentiality of its confidential material available to him during the course
of his employment, and not to use it for purposes
other than those of the
employer, and that in breach of this duty he used confidential information of
the plaintiff for his own benefit
or for the benefit of DHB.
<P>

14   	The statement of claim sets out particulars of information
claimed to be confidential but in the long run the claim of the
plaintiff went
only to the following information:-
<P>

(a)	The names and addresses of clients of the plaintiff.
<P>

(b)	The names and telephone numbers of contacts including material recorded in
a certain telephone address book.
<P>

(c)	Business cards which Corsiatto collected while in the plaintiff's
employment.
<P>

(d)	A list prepared by Corsiatto during his employment, which he was said to
have taken with him.  So far as this latter matter
is concerned, I have already
found that the claim was not made out.  
<P>

15   	It is claimed that Corsiatto wrongfully used this
confidential information, to create a list of clients for his own purposes,
to
enable him to approach clients to seek their business or direct their business
to himself.  
<P>

16   	It is further claimed that he used this material for the
purpose of enabling him to send the letter which he sent to H &amp;
N clients
on 9 October 1996 and that thereafter and continuing to the present time he has
continued to use this confidential information
to attract business of the
former H &amp; N clients to himself.  It is claimed that in so doing he has
disclosed to DHB confidential
information of H &amp; N as to the clients
insurance arrangements.  
<P>

17   	The claim pursued against Mrs. Rodwell is that she
received the benefit of moneys, namely commissions paid to Corsiatto as
a
result of the business of former H &amp; N clients, knowing that these
commissions were the result of Corsiatto having breached
his fiduciary duty to
the plaintiff.  The pleaded claim was wider but this was the only claim
pressed.
<P>

18   	As against DHB it is claimed that it knowingly received
commissions obtained as a result of breach of fiduciary duty by Corsiatto;
that
it was a knowing participant with Corsiatto in his breach of fiduciary duty to
H &amp; N; and profited thereby; that Corsiatto
was its agent in obtaining the
moneys through breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty and that it
induced Corsiatto to breach
his contract of employment with the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Claim against Corsiatto</b>
<P>

19   	I consider Corsiatto was in a fiduciary relationship with
the plaintiff.  While no longer a director and having suffered some
reduction
in privileges he was a senior employee responsible for about 20% of the
business of the plaintiff and in a position of
trust.  Having come to that
conclusion it is necessary to deal with the allegations of use of confidential
material.  So far as the
telephone address book is concerned, which is in
evidence, I do not consider it falls within the description of confidential
information.
 For the most part it contained private information of Corsiatto,
albeit that it did contain some information of some H &amp; N clients.
 So far
as the business cards are concerned they would perhaps technically be property
of the plaintiff, but could not be regarded
as confidential material.  Neither
of these things really matters because I have found that the lists compiled by
Corsiatto were
compiled at least in part from the records of H &amp; N and that
this was done during his employment by the plaintiff for the purpose
of
assisting him after he left H &amp; N and in breach of his fiduciary duty to H
&amp; N.  This was more than proper preparation
for a new career, yet all this
did was to save Corsiatto time as I think it quite clear that over a period of
time with the expenditure
of some amount of effort he would have been able to
compile his own list from memory, road maps, telephone books and the like, and
of course many of the clients might have sought out Corsiatto themselves.  Thus
contrary to the argument of the plaintiff it is quite
impossible to think that
all benefits received by Corsiatto as a result of commissions earned by DHB
from former H &amp; N clients
to the present time and into the future should be
accounted to H &amp; N as resulting from his improper conduct.  One can
understand
the attitude of Mr. Halliday, who has built up his business partly
by purchasing client lists of other brokers.  It was obvious from
his evidence
he felt that Corsiatto was under some obligation not to take any clients with
him, even though Mr. Halliday appears
to have received the benefit of business
which a sub-broker of his has brought to him.  But whether or not that is Mr.
Halliday's
view of proper conduct it is not the law.  The law is that Corsiatto
is obliged to account to H &amp; N for profits obtained as a
result of breach
of fiduciary duty, or to pay equitable compensation to compensate the plaintiff
for loss as a result of that breach
or to pay damages for breach of contract.
There must be some causal connection see <b><cite>O'Halloran v R.T. Thomas
&amp; Family Pty. Ltd</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/596.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 596</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 262</a> at 272/3.
<P>

20   	In a case such as this where there is no particular trade
secret wrongly used there has to be some limit to the liability
as it is
impossible to say that at some stage the benefits flowing to Corsiatto would
not have flowed in any event, see <b><cite>Warman International Limited v
Dwyer</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20544" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182 CLR 544.</a>  The evidence shows that clients are
inclined to move with the person who looks after their affairs.  Had this been
a "springboard"
type claim for an injunction then I am of the view the court
would have been likely to have granted an injunction restraining Corsiatto
from
dealing with any H &amp; N clients for a period of at the most six months.  It
is appropriate to apply this reasoning by analogy
to a case such as this:  see
<b><cite>US Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Pty.
Ltd</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20766" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 766</a> at 815.  Thus in my view the proper order to
be made in this case is that Corsiatto account to the plaintiff for all profits
earned
from commissions paid to DHB by insurers in respect of former H &amp; N
clients earned in respect of insurances taken out or renewed
up to 9 April
1997. H &amp; N, if it so elected, would be entitled to equitable compensation
for its loss arising through beach of
the fiduciary obligation or to damages
for breach of contract.  However, it is difficulty to see how any such claim
could achieve
a better result for the plaintiff than an account of profits.
<P>

<b>Claim against Mrs. Rodwell</b>
<P>

21   	In my view this claim fails.  It has not been established
that Mrs. Rodwell knew of any breach of fiduciary duty owing by
Corsiatto to
the plaintiff, nor that she knowingly received moneys impressed with a trust.
In fact in the absence of the court order
it is not at all clear "trust moneys"
were received.  There can be no doubt that Mrs. Rodwell was aware that
Corsiatto was receiving
his percentage of commissions as a result of premiums
paid on insurances effected by former H &amp; N clients.  The evidence does
not
establish that Mrs. Rodwell knowingly benefited from moneys which she knew were
obtained as a result of some breach of fiduciary
duty by Corsiatto.  The claim
against her fails.
<P>

<b>Claim against DHB</b>
<P>

22   	The first claim to be dealt with is that some time after
July 1996 DHB entered into an arrangement with Corsiatto whereby
Corsiatto
would use confidential information to divert clients from H &amp; N to DHB, and
in addition that DHB induced Corsiatto
to breach his contract of employment
with the plaintiff by using the confidential information to the detriment of
the plaintiff.
 There is no evidence to support these claims of conspiratorial
conduct or of inducement of breach of contract.  Corsiatto had not
determined
where he would work until shortly before he left H &amp; N.  Neither is there
evidence which establishes that Corsiatto
was the agent of DHB when he acted in
breach of his contract of employment or in breach of his fiduciary duty to H
&amp; N.  It is
undoubtedly the position that DHB knew that Corsiatto would
approach clients of H &amp; N, but it has not been established that DHB
knew of
any improper means used by Corsiatto to enable him to make contact with H &amp;
N clients or that he had engaged in some
improper conduct in constructing his
list of contacts.  In fact what was established was that when protests and
complaints were made
to DHB about the conduct of Corsiatto he was queried about
this and maintained that he had done nothing wrong and had not taken or
kept
any confidential material.  It is, as I have said, perfectly obvious that the
directors of DHB were well aware benefits were
flowing to them through the
insurances of former H &amp; N clients.  What has not been shown is that they
were aware of any improper
conduct by Corsiatto which enabled them to obtain
those benefits.  Therefore it could not be said that in some way Corsiatto was
the agent of DHB in constructing his list as he did nor that they knowingly
received moneys impressed with a trust, nor that they
had constructive notice
of it, nor that they were knowing participants in a breach of fiduciary duty.
In other words their conduct
was not dishonest:  <b><cite>Royal Brunei Airlines
v Tan </cite></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] AC 378</a>  The claim fails against DHB.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

23   	The result of my decision is that the plaintiff will
become entitled to a very small amount against Corsiatto.  It is a regrettable
fact that this case has been before the Registrar for directions and/or motions
on 15 occasions.  The costs are out of all proportion
to the small benefit
gained.  It was apparently envisaged that there would be an order made for an
account of profits up to the present
time for all income received from previous
H &amp; N clients and an order for compensation to cover future loss of the
business of
those clients.  That result could never have been obtained.  The
judgment in <b><cite>Warman</cite></b> at pages 556 to 562 makes that clear.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

24   	I will hear submissions on the final orders.  The claim
against the second and third defendants should be dismissed.  It should
not be
necessary to have a formal account of profits between the parties and it should
be possible to agree on a figure subject to
the right to elect for
compensation.  The plaintiff must pay the costs of the second and third
defendants.  Subject to any further
argument the first defendant should pay the
costs of the plaintiff to date but not including costs of the accountants
report Exhibit
G.
