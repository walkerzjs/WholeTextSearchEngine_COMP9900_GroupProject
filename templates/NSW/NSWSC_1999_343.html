His Honour:
<P>

1	These are five sets of proceedings brought under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act
1982</a> ("the FPA") by five of the children of Wilhelmina Emma Webb, deceased,
namely, Graham David Webb ("Graham"), Barry Neil Webb ("Barry"),
Peter Allen
Webb ("Peter"), Brenda May Kitteridge ("Brenda") and Barbara Linda Graham
("Barbara"), against her executors claiming
that provision or greater provision
should be made for them out of her estate than was made by her will dated 31
July 1990 ("the
will").  The lastmentioned set of proceedings has been settled,
and the Court has been asked to approve the settlement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31</a> of the FPA.
The other four sets of proceedings have been heard before me, and I have
deferred the application for approval of the
settlement of the fifth until I
deliver judgment in those four, which I now proceed to do.
<P>

<b>The Legal Framework</b>
<P>

2	A majority of the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ) said in
<b>Singer v Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> (at 208-9) that the court in
determining an application for provision under the FPA is required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 7</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a> to carry out a two-stage process.  The first stage requires a determination
"whether the applicant has been left without adequate
provision for his or her
proper maintenance, education and advancement in life."  The second stage,
which arises if that determination
be made in favour of the applicant, is "to
decide what provision ought to be made out of the deceased's estate for the
applicant."
 The determination of the first stage "calls for an assessment of
whether the provision (if any) made was inadequate for what, in
all the
circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc, appropriate for the
applicant having regard, amongst other things,
to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship between the
applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or
her
bounty."  The correct view of the first stage is that the question is
strictly one of fact, notwithstanding that it involves the
exercise of value
judgments.  The second question involves an exercise of discretion in the
accepted sense, although that discretion
must, of course, be exercised
judicially.  That majority of the High Court disapproved the use in determining
these questions of
reference to the concepts of "moral duty" or "moral
obligation", or even the use of those terms, since this might be thought to
place
a gloss upon the statute.  Whilst there has been some debate as to
whether or not that view was an <i>obiter dictum</i> only, the Court of Appeal
has since determined, despite the eloquent dissent of Handley JA, that that
expression of opinion ought
be taken in this Court as the binding view of the
High Court upon this subject matter:  see <b>Permanent Trustee Co Ltd v
Fraser</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 24</a>; <b>Massingham v Massingham</b>, 27 June 1996,
Court of Appeal, NSW, unreported.  Naturally I have approached the matter in
accordance with these principles.  I
have also borne in mind, these claims all
being claims of adult children of the testator, that I simply carry out the
two-stage process
in relation to those persons in the context of this family
and this estate; the appellate Courts have negatived that there is any
"special" test or approach to the process in the case of adult children, as
opposed to other persons with a claim:  see <b>Hughes v National Trustees
Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20143%20CLR%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 143 CLR 134</a>; <b>Hunter v
Hunter</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 573.</a>  The time at which adequacy or inadequacy is to
be judged is the time at which the Court is determining whether or not to make
an
order.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 12</a> of the FPA provides that where the Court makes an order
for provision, it may specify the portions of the estate which shall bear
the
burden of the provision.
<P>

<b>The Family</b>
<P>

3	The testator was born on 20 January 1910.  She died on 3 June 1993.  She was
married once only, to Joseph Henry Webb ("Joseph
Snr") on 17 April 1930.  There
were seven children of the marriage, as set out below.  All of them are
beneficiaries under her will
and/or parties to these proceedings.  The four
youngest children are listed before the three eldest, because the former are
the plaintiffs
in the contested proceedings:
<P>

<P>

(2)	Barry Neil Webb, born 27 September 1945 ("Barry");
<P>

(3)	Graham David Webb, born 13 June 1947 ("Graham"); and
<P>

<P>

Apart from some inconsequential legacies, the other beneficiaries of the will
are John's wife and the testator's grandchildren,

<P>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

4	I now proceed to examine the facts in order to carry out the two-stage
process in the four contested suits and to determine the
application for
approval of the settlement of the fifth.  The bulk of the facts that I set out
below are not or not seriously contested,
or appear clearly from the evidence,
save where indicated otherwise.  The principal area in which there has been
serious factual
contest is the reasons for the undoubted breakdown of the
relationship between the testator and the first four plaintiffs.  There
are
disputes of less significance as to the degree of Graham's present capacity for
work and the reasons for Barry's failure in business.

<P>

5	Joseph Snr was born about 1903.  He was a rentier who during his lifetime
accumulated a considerable portfolio of properties in
Sydney.  He conducted a
retail shoe shop until 1953 but thereafter his only business was the
administration and management of his
properties.  He involved most of his
children at some time in that business.  It was agreed on behalf of the
defendants that he "conducted
his affairs on the basis that all authority lay
with him and that the others were to contribute according to their talents or
his
will."  From about 1982 till shortly before his father's death, the child
principally involved in the business was John.  Joseph
Snr made his last will
on 27 September 1987.  He died on 21 July 1989.  Probate of that will was duly
granted to the executors and
trustees named therein, Burns Philp Trustee
Company Limited and Richard Stephen Vale, solicitor.  His estate was sworn at
almost
$8,500,000, but the amount finally distributed to the beneficiaries was
about $5,300,000<b>.  </b>This was due in part to a decline in real estate
prices between the grant of probate and the realisation of the assets and in
part
to various expenses.  The will, in broad terms, gave a legacy of $25,000
to each of the seven children and the residue of the estate
to his trustees to
pay the income to the testator for her life and after her death to divide the
residue equally among the seven
children.  The estate was the subject of
proceedings under the FPA.  These were settled, and the estate was rearranged
by an order
of this Court made by consent on 25 June 1990, under which the
testator received a gift of $1,558,750 and the residue after payment
of costs
was divided equally among the seven children.  There were detailed provisions
as to how these gifts were to be satisfied,
eg, by the transfer of specific
assets.
<P>

6	By the will, made after that settlement, the testator appointed John, Joseph
and Colleen her executors and trustees.  After small
monetary legacies to
relatives other than children and grandchildren and gifts of personal chattels
and omitting gifts of shares
which have become irrelevant, she gave the residue
of her estate equally among the survivors of Joseph, John, Colleen and Barbara
and of her grandchildren who survived her and attained majority.  When I say
that the gifts of shares have become irrelevant, the
situation is that the
company involved, Olga Investments Pty Limited, has been wound up since the
testator's death and that portion
of the estate administered by payment of the
proceeds of those shares to the beneficiaries; those amounts are included in
the current
assets of the recipients set out below, but were so relatively
small as to have no effect on what follows.  The will thus totally
excluded
Brenda, Barry, Graham and Peter, who are the plaintiffs in the proceedings that
have been tried.  The estate has been converted
to cash and the available funds
are about $1,750,000.  In the events which have happened, the effect of the
will is to divide this
fund into 15 equal shares, the recipients of which are
Joseph, John, Barbara, Colleen and the 11 grandchildren.
<P>

7	The testator's disinheritance of her four youngest children did not go
unexplained.  In the chambers of counsel in July 1991 she
gave instructions for
the preparation of a statement explaining her will and, after being settled, it
was signed by her on 23 September
1991.  The signed statement ("the statement")
was tendered under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> of the FPA, which makes admissible (inter alia)
relevant statements by a testator contained in a document.  No objection was
taken
to any part of the statement, and the whole of it was admitted into
evidence, along with a draft, and the notes taken by counsel
during the
conference.  The statement sets out ways in which the testator believed that
her three eldest children and Colleen had
been supportive of her and recounts
at some length conduct of her four youngest children of which she complains;
the nub of her explanation
of the provisions of the will is contained in the
following paragraphs:
<P>

"4	I remade my will after the conclusion of proceedings brought under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in respect of my late husband's estate by my children,
Brenda, Barry, Graham and Peter.
<P>

5	I have made no provision in my will for those children.  I consider that
adequate provision has already been made for them out
of my late husband's
estate.
<P>

6	Throughout the period from my husband's death to the conclusion of the
proceedings in respect of his estate and since then also,
those children have
showed me no consideration.  After my husband's funeral, each of them was
invited back to the house but not one
of them would come.  The only contacts
that I have had with them since then have been on the occasions that they
complained of my
husband's will and several of them have been very abusive
towards me.  They don't like me, they don't visit me or telephone me or
contact
me in any way.  They don't even send me Christmas or birthday cards.
<P>

7	In proceedings brought by these four children after the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
proceedings, Brenda gave evidence by affidavit on their behalf saying that I
was made [sic] or incapable.  I had to go to see Dr.
Asprey and Dr. Jolly to
show that I was mentally competent.
<P>

......
<P>

10	I have left my estate to be divided amongst my supportive children, Colleen
and all of my grandchildren.  Each of my grandchildren
could do with something
to give them a start in life.  I do not trust their parents (other than John
and Colleen) to administer the
moneys for them."
<P>

Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(8)</a> of the FPA regard is to be had, in estimating the weight to be
attached to any statement admitted, all the circumstances from which
any
inference can be drawn as to its accuracy, including any relevant matter dealt
with in the statement and any incentive for the
deceased to misrepresent any
matter.  It is clear that the statement was created after familial
relationships had substantially broken
down and for the purpose of justifying
the exclusion of four children from the will.  It is largely in the testator's
own language
(see counsel's notes) and is emotive in tone.  Equally, the
evidence as to these matters given by the five children who gave evidence
and
by Colleen must be viewed in the light of the high emotions involved and the
self interest of the deponents.
<P>

8	What is clear from the statement and that evidence is that there was a
distancing or further distancing in relations between the
testator and the four
youngest children after Joseph Snr's death, and particularly in relation to the
FPA proceedings taken in respect
of his estate.  As will appear below, it is
also clear that there there had already substantial disruptions to the familial
relationships
between the parents and the children and among the siblings
before the father's death.  It is a sad but undoubted fact that the children
came to be described, at least by the four youngest, as "the top three" and
"the bottom four".  What is much less clear is the cause
or mechanism of this
disruption.  Days were taken up by evidence about these intra-familial
relationships, both before and after
the father's death.  As already noted,
there is serious .conflict as to these matters.  Most relevantly, there is
conflict between
the testator's account in the statement (supported by some
evidence of John and Colleen) that, after Joseph Snr's death, each of
her four
youngest children ignored and neglected her, and the evidence of each of "the
bottom four" that overtures were made to the
testator and rejected.  The
resolution of this conflict, so far as it needs to be resolved, will be dealt
with below.
<P>

<b>The facts relating to the plaintiffs in the contested proceedings</b>
<P>

9	I shall set out with respect to each of the plaintiffs in the contested
proceedings a general history and the facts relating to
the individual's
financial and other needs and particular relationship with the testator.
<P>

<b>Brenda</b>
<P>

10	Brenda was born on 15 August 1940 and is now 58.  She left school in 1957
with the Leaving Certificate.  She lived at home until
married in 1959.  She
had three children, Robert (11), Lee (12) and Stephen (13).  Only Stephen now
lives with her.  For some 13
years she worked in her father's business, until
she and her husband moved to Gosford in 1978.  She and her husband separated in
1989 and subsequently divorced.  Her father then allowed her to live in one of
his properties at McMahons Point.  There was some
talk of him advancing her
$70,000 to help her buy a home, but this did not eventuate.  Under the
settlement of her father's estate,
she vacated the house in McMahons Point, was
excused any payment in respect of her past occupation of it and received a
property
at Greenwich.  She sold that property in 1996 for $765,000.
<P>

11	Brenda claims to have had "a good and close relationship with [her] father."
This seems to be borne out by the fact that in 1989,
in the last four months of
her father's life, he went and lived in her home, where she looked after him,
and he appointed her to
manage his business in place of John.  In earlier life,
she had a close relationship with her mother.  She helped her mother about
the
house before she left home.  Despite bad relations with John, she maintained
close relations with her mother (although more distantly
after her move to
Gosford) until her separation from her husband in 1989.  Thereafter, her
evidence is that her mother "grew cold"
and became "angry and bitter" towards
her.  She believes that this arose from her mother's view that Brenda should go
back to her
husband (although it is Brenda's evidence that her husband left
her).  It seems that the testator was hostile at Joseph Snr putting
Brenda in
charge of the family business in place of John.  The hostility was undoubtedly
redoubled by the FPA proceedings over Joseph
Snr's estate; the statement bears
that out.  Brenda's account is that the testator increasingly kept her daughter
away; all efforts
"to make contact with her [mother] were refused".  The
testator's account is that there were no such efforts.  Brenda has had a
difficult
relationship with John since her childhood.  They have not spoken
since she was 17.
<P>

12	She owns the house at 7 Charles Street, Castlecrag in which she lives.  It
is valued at $560,000.  She bought it out of the proceeds
of the Greenwich
property mentioned above.  It is unencumbered. She owns household effects
valued at $2,500 and two motor vehicles
together valued at $18,000.  She has
about $96,000 in a bank account.  Her assets have a total value of $683,500.
She has a tax debt
of about $30,000 which is "currently coming up for payment".
Her only income, in addition to a disability support pension of $147.40
per
week, is interest on her bank account, which now amounts to less than $90 per
week.  Her weekly outgoings are about $297 per
week.
<P>

13	She has multiple health problems which cause her significant incapacity.
She is virtually an invalid.  She can do only light
housework.  She is
incapable of gainful employment.
<P>

14	On her behalf it is submitted that, because her outgoings exceed her income,
she must resort to her capital to live, and this
demonstrates a need for
provision.  The defendants contend that "there is nothing in the evidence to
indicate that there should be
any increase."  It is conceded that "the size of
her resources, her condition of health and the fact that she is arriving at the
afternoon of her [life]" are "major considerations" which ought be taken into
account.  It is said, however, that "some aspects of
her conduct conspicuously
lack merit."
<P>

<b>Barry</b>
<P>

15	Barry was born on 27 September 1945 and is now 53.  He left school in 1961
without an Intermediate Certificate.  He worked, generally
in the family
business between 1962 and 1980 and lived at home until he married in 1968.  He
has four children, Michael (14), Stephen
(15), Brian (16) and Jason (17).
When, in 1980, he finally left the family business it was, he said, because
John "started to dictate
how it was to be run".  He then went into business on
his own account, and later worked in a business conducted by his sons, Michael
and Stephen.  Those businesses were not successful.  It will be necessary to
say more below of the circumstances of their failure.
<P>

16	Barry claims to have had reasonably good relations with both parents up to
his father's death.  His father from time to time
allowed him to live in one of
his properties that was being renovated as part of his remuneration (which, it
seems was probably at
rates less than commercial).  In 1988 his father lent him
$120,000.  Relations with his mother have certainly been disrupted since
his
father's death.  In the settlement of his father's estate, he repaid the amount
that his father had lent him together with a
small amount of interest, and
received a property in Darlinghurst.  He sold that property in 1995 for
$265,000.  The money has gone
in meeting debts and living expenses.  His
relationship with John has long been bad.  They have not spoken for many
years.
<P>

17	Barry now lives in Queensland, in rented accommodation, with his wife, Brian
and Jason.  He owns only a motor vehicle and some
personal effects with a total
value of $5,000.  He has debts to at least four financial institutions
amounting to $22,000. He has
not worked for many years.  The weekly household
income consists of Barry's disability pension of $328, Brian's disability
pension
of $170, and Jason's unemployment benefits of $72, a total of $570 per
week.  The weekly outgoings are about $630 per week.
<P>

18	Barry's health is not good.  His greatest health problem is angina.  This is
generally stable, but he has had one unstable incident,
necessitating
hospitalisation.  He has hypertension, controlled by medication.  He has
chronic asthma and allergic rhinitis.  He
is obese and has sleep apnoea.  He
has a spondylosis, which causes back pain.  He has some depression and anxiety.
His wife is feared
to have cancer.  Brian is intellectually disabled, as
appears below.
<P>

19	On Barry's behalf, it is contended that his financial position and that of
his family, and their prospects, are desperate.  The
defendants in effect
concede a need, but contend that, by reason of history, funds or property
should not be put in Barry's personal
control.
<P>

<b>Graham</b>
<P>

20	Graham was born on 13 June 1947 and is now 51.  He left school in 1962 with
an Intermediate Certificate.  Between 1963 and 1980,
but for two short periods,
he worked in his father's business.  He has been married three times.  He has
separated from his third
wife and they have been or are to be divorced.  He has
two children, Alexander (18) and Rachael (19).  He took up work installing
wardrobes in 1989.  He was dismissed from that work in 1997.  He lives alone in
rented premises.
<P>

21	Graham says he kept in "close contact" with his father throughout his life.
He did not receive a regular wage from his father
until 1977.  He says he left
the family business in 1980 because he would not work with John.  That year his
father lent him $50,000,
which he repaid over time.  In the settlement of his
father's estate he received the property at Cammeray which he still owns.  He
feels his mother "showed [him] no love" and that when he refused to work with
John, she rejected him entirely.  Certainly relations
between them were
disrupted after his father's death.  He has no relationship with John.  They
have not spoken since about 1974.
<P>

22	A matrimonial property settlement has been effected with his third wife.  He
owns the property at 46 Collins Street, Cammeray,
which is valued at $520,000.
He owns a motor vehicle and personal effects valued at $3,500.  He owes $42,000
secured on his property
at Cammeray and has other debts totalling $1,000.  His
only income is rent of $430 per week from the Cammeray property, which is
let.
His weekly outgoings amount to $580 per week, including rent of $250 and
maintenance payments of $50.
<P>

23	He has chronic asthma and repeated chest infections.  He has palpitations
and chest pain with physical exertion.  He smokes heavily.
 He also has
psychological disabilities.  He has a longstanding depressive illness and
consumes alcohol to excess.  There are underlying
psychological problems
concerning which there was evidence which I made the subject of a non
publication order.
<P>

24	On Graham's behalf, it is contended that a need is shown.  The defendants on
the one hand concede that he "is in a predicament,
his wife is in a predicament
which is partly of his making and his children are certainly in a predicament."
On the other, they contend
that "the extent of his true need is doubtful" and
that if "any need is shown it must be very marginal."
<P>

<b>Peter</b>
<P>

25	Peter was born on 19 February 1951 and is now 48.  He left school in 1966
with the School Certificate.  Between 1966 and 1972
he had various jobs,
including gardening and lawnmowing for a municipal council.  In 1972 he began a
lawnmowing business.  For the
next ten years he worked in lawnmowing businesses
or in his father's business.  He finally left his father's business in 1982.
He
now has part time work cleaning and mowing lawns.  He resides in shared
rented accommodation.  He lives very frugally.
<P>

26	He appears to have been close to his father during his lifetime.  When he
worked in his father's business he was paid a "regular
wage" only from time to
time.  In 1988 his parents lent him $101,000 so that he could buy a home unit.
He repaid this at the rate
of $100 per week during his father's lifetime.  His
father also gave him assistance in buying motor vehicles and lawnmowing
businesses.
 The arrangement between them was loose; Peter paid back what he
could.  In the settlement of his father's estate, he had to repay
the money
that had been lent to him to buy a unit.  He says he received no credit for the
amounts that he had already repaid, but
he received the Darlinghurst properties
mentioned below.  He says that, but for a short period between 1980 and 1982,
his relationship
with his mother was close during his father's lifetime.  But
there is no doubt that it broke down after the death of his father.
 He has no
relationship with John.  They have not spoken since before the death of his
father.
<P>

27	He owns two properties in Darlinghurst.  Together they are valued at
$800,000.  He has a motor vehicle, lawnmowing equipment
and personal effects
valued at $3,400.  He owes $32,000, which is secured on one of the Darlinghurst
properties.  He has tax and
other obligations which amount to over $20,000.  He
has an income of about $746 per week, derived partly from the rent of the
Darlinghurst
properties and partly from his part time work.  His weekly
outgoings (including expenses of the Darlinghurst properties) amount to
about
$747.
<P>

28	He suffers from grand mal epilepsy, the control of which is not entirely
certain.  He has been a heavy drinker.  He became addicted
to heroin and has
been for some years in a methadone programme..  His drinking and heroin
addiction appear both to be controlled.
 He is, for all practical purposes,
unfit for more work than he is doing.
<P>

29	He would like to liquidate his debts and have a house of his own to live in.
The defendants contend that "it is very difficult
to conceive of any situation
where he really requires more" and that "if any order is made then payment off
his current debt is all
that is indicated."  He was stringently cross examined
to suggest that it was most unreasonable of him to leave his substance invested
in real estate when, with the aid of an investment adviser, the capital could
earn a higher income in different forms of investment.
<P>

<b>The facts relating to "eligible persons" other than the first four
plaintiffs</b>
<P>

30	The eligible persons, other than the plaintiffs in the contested
proceedings, are the testator's remaining children, Joseph,
John and Barbara.
I shall set out the facts relating to them in generally the same way as has
been done in relation to the plaintiffs
in the contested proceedings.  It has
not been suggested that Colleen or any of the grandchildren is an "eligible
person" by reason
of paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)</a>
of the FPA.
<P>

<b>Joseph</b>
<P>

31	Joseph was born on 23 September 1930 and is now 68.  He left school in Third
Year without an Intermediate Certificate.  He is
of limited intellectual
ability and was not a good learner.  He has never married despite a desire to
do so.  He has led a solitary
life.  For many years he worked away from Sydney,
in places including Melbourne and London, and lived in boarding houses.  During
the last years of his mother's life, he returned to Sydney and lived with her
at her house in Olga Road, Chatswood.  He continued
to live alone in that large
house after her death, until it was sold to liquidate the estate.  He has had a
casual job attending
to the grounds at Hunters Hill High School, although it
now seems unlikely that he will continue to work.  From his father's estate
he
received the wherewithal to purchase the property he owns.
<P>

32	Subject to his absences from Sydney and his rather solitary nature, he
appears to have had a good relationship with his father.
 It is clear, from the
fact of his residence with her as stated above and other evidence, that he had
a close relationship with his
mother, particularly in the latter years of her
life.  He owns two semi detached properties at 538-540 Willoughby Road
Willoughby
valued at $580,000 and a house property at 90 Coward Street Mascot
valued at $300,000.  He lives in 538 Willoughby Road.  He would
receive under
the terms of the will 1/15th of the testator's residuary estate, which is about
$115,000.  He has income from the lettings
of the other two properties of about
$480 per week gross.  He has had a small income from his casual work.  His
affairs are managed
by John and Colleen, but the time will probably come when a
manager of his estate will need to be appointed.  His health is generally
good
for his age, although he may need a knee operation in the near future.
<P>

<b>John</b>
<P>

33	John was born on 23 October 1931 and is now 67.  He was educated as a
boarder at Killara Preparatory School and Barker College,
but left at the end
of Second Year at his father's instance.  After a year in other employment he
went to work for his father, at
first in the shoe store and then in relation to
the properties.  He had a break from 1959 to 1962.  He married Colleen in 1963.
She
also over the years assisted in his father's business.  He left again in
1969, when he concedes there was friction between him and
his brothers.  He
started his own business, but participated intermittently in his father's
business between 1969 and 1981.  But
the most significant period of his
involvement was between 1982 and 1989, during his father's declining years.
Broadly, he was in
charge.  He retained a right to maintain his own business
and received management fees or a "joint wage" for his and Colleen's work
in
his father's business, and his sons' school fees were paid 
<P>

34	He clearly had a close relationship with his father, although his father's
replacement, in the last months of his life, of John
by Brenda in the
management of the business seems to show some reservation on his father's part.
He and Colleen were clearly close
to the testator.  They jointly own two
properties, their home in Forestville, which is valued at $320,000, and a
commercial property
at North Sydney which is valued at $300,000.  They have a
joint account in the sum of about $143,000.  They own trading stock valued
at
$8,000.  They own a motor vehicle and personal effects valued at $32,500.
Their assets amount to $803,500.  All are unencumbered.
 They have credit card
obligations in the amount of $7,000.  They still conduct and earn some income
from their business<b>.  </b>Each would receive a 1/15th share under the terms
of the will<b>.  </b>He has had a pacemaker inserted, but his health is
generally good, as is Colleen's.
<P>

<b>Barbara</b>
<P>

35	Barbara was born on 14 February 1939 and is now 60.  It is clear that she is
schizophrenic and was hospitalised for that condition
during the 1960s.  The
schizophrenia is said to be in remission, but she still receives regular
psychiatric supervision and takes
anti-psychotic medication.  She is not of
high intelligence and is na&iuml;ve.  She has from time to time during her life
had various
fairly menial jobs, and of late years has worked in a sheltered
workshop.  She has married and divorced and subsequently lived in
a de facto
relationship, but is not at present in any relationship.  Up until March 1998
her financial affairs were managed by John
and Colleen.  On 25 March 1998 the
Guardianship Tribunal made an order that she was a person incapable of managing
her own affairs
and appointed the Protective Commissioner to manage her affairs
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a>.  It also made a partial guardianship
order in relation to her and appointed the Public Guardian her guardian for the
purposes of
that order.  The proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal were
initiated by Brenda.  Whether or not this was mischievous, as alleged
by the
defendants, matters not for the purposes of these proceedings.  It is plain on
the available evidence that the Guardianship
Tribunal's orders were
justified.
<P>

36	She appears to have had good relations with her parents, allowing for her
psychiatric incapacity.  That her relationship with
her mother was reasonably
good is attested by the fact that she was one of the children provided for by
the testator in her will.
 She lives in a rented Housing Commission flat,
although she pays full rent for it by reason of her income.  She owns a
property
at 7 Olympia Road Naremburn valued at $600,000, which is rented.  The
gross rental is about $480 per week.  Her net income is stated
by John to be
$288 per week.  Her tax returns show an interest deduction in respect of the
rented property of some $7,000 per annum,
which suggests a borrowing against
the property in the order of $100,000.  She would receive under the terms of
the will a 1/15th
share.  The settlement of her FPA claim, if approved, will
provide a further fund of $100,000 vested in trustees for her benefit.
 That
sum was arrived at on the assumption that she would retain her 1/15th share of
the residuary estate.
<P>

<b>The facts relating to the beneficiaries who are not "eligible
persons"</b>
<P>

37	These persons are (8) - (19), Colleen and the testator's grandchildren.
Colleen's financial affairs are intertwined with John's
and are as set out
above in relation to him.  It is plain that, whatever be the rights and wrongs
of the absence of various of her
children from this role, Colleen was close to
the testator and afforded her care and support during her declining years, for
which
the testator was grateful.  The grandchildren are all adult except
Graham's infant children, Alexander (18) who is 8, and Rachel
(19) who is 6.
Except as noted below, they appear to be ordinary people of varying ages making
their different ways through life
in a relatively ordinary way.  No doubt they
have various problems, as do most people, but I do not regard them as having
any specific
disability.  Those who may be regarded as having specific
disabilities are children of Barry.  Brian (16) has some degree of mental
retardation.  Psychological and other evidence shows him to be "intellectually
mentally deficient", to have limited employment prospects
and to be incapable
of managing his own affairs.  This is a real disability.  There seemed to be
some suggestion that Jason (17),
as well as Brian, is under some mental
incapacity or unable to manage his affairs, but a psychologist's report shows
that, whilst
he is of low average intelligence and limited literacy and
numeracy, his practical skills are quite good, and he is a an ordinary
and
quite sound young man.  The disability of Stephen (15) is financial.  He was
adjudged bankrupt in 1995 as a result of the business
conducted by him with his
father.  He is still bankrupt, but may be discharged in 2000.  He has grand mal
epilepsy, but this is controlled,
and I do not regard it as a substantial
disability.
<P>

<b>Facts in issue</b>
<P>

38	As noted above, the principal factual contests in the proceedings were as
follows:
<P>

(1)	The main contest was, in general terms, between the testator's assertion in
the statement that her four youngest children had
rejected her and their
counter assertion that she had rejected them.  Behind this issue lay conflict
as to the origin of the family
dysfunction and, in particular, the degree to
which it was a result of partiality by Joseph Snr and the testator towards some
part
of their family, particularly John and Colleen.
<P>

(2)	The degree of Graham's capacity or incapacity to earn an income, said to be
relevant to the degree of his need.
<P>

(3)	The degree of Barry's incapacity to manage his affairs, said to be
evidenced largely by his business failures, although there
is other material.
The fact is that he has lost his financial substance and is now without assets.
His alleged incapacity was said
to be relevant not so much to the question of
his need, which was conceded or virtually conceded, but as to whether any
provision
for him should take the form of moneys subjected to a protective
trust.
<P>

39	Turning to Question 1, as to the "rejection" of the testator and the origins
of the family dysfunction generally, this goes to
the consideration of the
conduct of the plaintiffs, and whether it should have any impact on the making
of provision for them, if
need be established.  Under the Testators Family
Maintenance and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act 1916</a> now repealed (the TFM Act)
there was specific provision of a defence of conduct disentitling, as there is
in most other States. 
That provision has not been repeated in the FPA.
Instead, the FPA refers to conduct before and after the testator's death as a
factor
to be taken into consideration by the Court in determining whether
relief ought be granted.  The defendants' submission, so far as
I could
understand it, was that the conduct of some of the plaintiffs at least was such
that it should weigh in the balance against
making provision in their
favour.
<P>

40	There are two preliminary things to be said.  The first is that there is
real difficulty in coming to any concluded view as to
the rights and wrongs of
old family hurts.  The second is that a firm conclusion about those matters
would really be of only marginal
significance in this case.  These conflicts
concern facts extending over many years, indeed decades.  It is necessary to
bear in
mind, as Dixon CJ said in <b>The Pontifical Society for the Propagation
of the Faith v Scales</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20107%20CLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 107 CLR 9</a> at 20, "that one story is good until
another is told, but a testator is dead and cannot tell his."  Although the
circumstances in
which the testator's words may be received in evidence have
been widened since that time, and some version of the testator's account
of
events is in evidence in the statement, this disadvantage remains significant.
In <b>Massingham v Massingham</b> supra Priestley JA said:
<P>

"In arriving at his opinions, the Master did not attempt to adjudicate upon the
rights and wrongs of the disputes within the family
leading up to the
estrangement ...  There would have been little point in his attempting to do
so.  The father and the mother were
both dead.  The events were very old.  The
brothers' views about one another and the past were fixed, strongly held, and
would undoubtedly
make it difficult for a judicial fact finder to be confident
in whatever conclusions were reached on their competing versions."
<P>

And see also per Priestley JA in <b>Hunter v Hunter </b>supra at 582-3.  In
<b>Massingham</b> the parties by agreement did not cross examine each other's
witnesses and "were in substantial agreement about the broad aspects
of the
history."  In this case, extensivecross examination did occur, but the broad
history of the relationships is not really disputed
or is clear.
<P>

41	In light of the above, I do not think it appropriate or useful to make more
than the following findings of fact in relation to
the matters of family
history.  The dysfunction in the family was old.  It went back before Joseph
Snr's death.  Tensions were created
by the way in which he employed various
children in his business.  The work they were given was usually fairly menial.
It was not
well remunerated.  Joseph Snr was reluctant to spend money, as
witnessed by the low standard of maintenance of his properties.  The
menial
nature of the work offered was partly but not entirely governed by the limited
ability of some of the children.  Greater ability
was displayed by John, and he
came to play a more managerial role in the business.  In his father's declining
years after 1981, he
in effect assumed control of the business.  Over the
years, all his siblings departed from participation in the business.  To some
degree, this was motivated by a desire for independence.  But there was also
friction with John.  He himself says so.  Relations
between John and his
siblings appear to have been difficult from a young age.  Each of the "bottom
four" at some stage appears to
have had a definitive break in relations with
John.  There was probably some jealousy.  The friction and jealousy arose in
part from
a perception that there was favouritism on the part, perhaps of
Joseph Snr, and certainly of the testator, towards John and Colleen.
 The
evidence shows that this perception, particularly in relation to the testator,
is general and long standing.  It is has been
expressed otherwise than in
direct evidence in the present proceedings (eg, in histories given by various
people to medical advisers).
 It is hard to think that there was not some
substance to it.  The testator certainly displayed partiality to John and
Colleen in
the statement.  It is patent that there was a clearer breach after
Joseph Snr's death.  An important factor in this was the bringing
of FPA
proceedings by some of the children in relation to his estate.  This, it is
clear, the testator bitterly resented.  That the
proceedings by the children
were not unreasonable is suggested by the rearrangement of the estate that
occurred in the settlement
of the proceedings.  The precise events and rights
and wrongs involved in the final breach between the testator and each of her
four
youngest children, and whether or not there were attempts at
reconciliation, and whether or not those attempts were rejected do not
matter.
In the context of this family, even if that conduct were as described by the
testator in the statement, I do not think it
would affect the situation.  And I
certainly do not find that matters were as one sided as that.  The breakdown
was the result of
a long, unhappy history.  In my view there is not established
any conduct on the part of any of the plaintiffs which should preclude
or
affect the relief which ought otherwise be granted, if need be established.
<P>

42	The evidence that I have found most perceptive and realistic concerning the
dynamics of the breakdown of the family relationships
came, interestingly, from
some of the children with considerable personal problems.  Peter is not highly
articulate, and gave his
evidence at times haltingly.  But he seemed to display
some detachment, and insight into what had occurred.  He gave the following
answers:
<P>

"Q.  When did you begin to notice two camps starting to form in the family?
<P>

A.  Back, oh, not till I was about 25.  I would have been about 25 I think ...
no, no well I suppose there would have been originally,
originally when I was
only about, about 20, 21 because I think my sister, Brenda, had a fall out with
him and then over the years
there seemed to be another brother so many years
later and then so many years later there was another brother and then I was the
last one ....
<P>

Q.  When you say there was a brother and another brother and another brother,
what do you mean?
<P>

A.  Well one after the other.  In our, like there was, I am not sure if it was,
I think it was Barry first, then Graham a bit later.
<P>

Q.  What did they do?  What did Barry and Graham do that you're talking about
now?
<P>

A.  Well they just, they fell out with him for their own reasons.
<P>

Q.  Fell out with who?
<P>

A.  With John.
<P>

Q.  What about you and your relationship with John?
<P>

A.  I, I fell out with him on the basis of I was not, I was not happy with,
with the way he was, he was standing over my father
on various occasions.
<P>

Q.  How old were you when you fell out with him in that way?
<P>

A.  It was, it was only, I was probably about 30 so, so it's probably about 15,
16 years ago.
<P>

.................................
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q.  To your mind was it a break down between John and various
different people that determined the camp into which
different people fell?
<P>

A.  ... Yes, I do, I do believe that.
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  Q. The story as you have been telling it seems to suggest that the
two camps grew up as different people each had their
own falling out with John,
they joined the dissident camp?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

.................................
<P>

[NEIL:]  Q.  You included your father in one camp.  Why was that?
<P>

A.  Because, well I think that he was because he said to me on various
occasions, `I am not, I am not pleased with John because
he is using mother as
a hostage.'
<P>

Q.  When did he say this?
<P>

A.  In numerous times, that many times I can't remember.
<P>

Q.  When in relation to his death:  shortly before, a long time before or
somewhere in between?
<P>

A.  Not long, not long, not long before his death but also, also several years
before."
<P>

And the matter was summed up by Joseph (significantly one of the "top three")
when he said to a psychologist:
<P>

"that the problems in the family and the split have been long term problems,
which occurred long before both parents died.  He was
unable to describe the
problems clearly, other than the others did not fit in with `Mum, John and
Colleen'.  He added `jealousy crept
in'."
<P>

That evidence supports the conclusions I have stated above.  The evidence of
fallings out with John many years back received corroboration
in John's
affidavit evidence and cross examination.  I should add that the above
conclusions have been set out, not to express condemnation
of anyone, but to
make plain that it would not be correct to conclude that the unhappy situation
between the testator and her four
youngest children can properly be attributed
to a rejection of their mother by those children after their father's death.
<P>

43	As to Question 2, relating to the degree of Barry's incapacity for work, the
basic facts of Barry's health are set out in [18]
above.  There is no great
dispute about them. He says that he undertakes only casual employment.  So
bitter was this family dispute
that a private inquiry agent was engaged to
watch him to see if it could be established that he was working more than he
claimed.
 The results I find quite inconclusive.  Despite cross examination of
Barry and the evidence of surveillance, I accept that Barry's
capacity for work
is as stated by Dr Higginbotham:
<P>

"With regard to his general state of health this is fair from the physical
stand point but rather poor from the psychiatric standpoint.
 He is fit for
part time work not involving great physical or mental demands and this
impairment, considering his history, is likely
to remain indefinite.'
<P>

It seems clear to me that his psychological and physical condition, his lack of
qualifications and his age make it difficult for
him to maintain full time
employment, and this situation is unlikely to improve and likely to
deteriorate.
<P>

44	I defer consideration of Question 3 until I consider the form of any orders
to be made for provision.
<P>

<b>Conclusions:  the first stage</b>
<P>

45	I have come to the view that each of the four plaintiffs in the contested
proceedings has established that he or she was left
by the testator without
adequate means for his or her support.  As I have said, in Barry's case this is
virtually self-evident. 
The other cases are less self-evident.  However, they
must be viewed against the background that this was a family in which
considerable
wealth was accumulated, making available a comfortable way of
life, and that even now there is more than $1,700,000 in the fund created
by
the liquidation of the testator's estate.  Graham owns a house from which he
derives income but has young children still to be
brought up.  There are limits
to his working capacity and his psychiatric health is uncertain.  Brenda has a
substantial house in
which she lives and, apart from a pension, an income of
only the interest from about $60,000 in cash.  She is in poor health and
unable
to earn a living.  She thus has a home, but little income or other assets.  It
may be that she ought or will consider moving
to a smaller residence and
freeing some of the capital tied up in the house for income earning purposes,
but her income would still
be small after provision of an alternative
residence.  Peter has the most substantial assets.  He resides in rented shared
accommodation
and lives in a spartan and thrifty way.  His income is the rent
from his two properties at Darlinghurst valued at $800,000 and some
income from
lawn mowing.  He has a mortgage debt of $40,000 on one of the Darlinghurst
properties.  He says he would like to own
a house.  There is a tension between
the suggestions, both made on behalf of the defendants, that, on the one hand,
Peter is adequately
provided for and simply ought organise his assets so as to
receive more income and, on the other hand, that having an admitted history
of
alcohol abuse and heroin addiction, he ought be regarded as being at financial
risk, and any provision made for him should be
subject to some protective
trust.  Although any person with a history of serious addiction must be at some
risk of relapse, he does
appear to have controlled his addictions over a long
period and to have been the most successful manager of his assets (with the
possible exception of John) among the testator's children.  As to the criticism
vigorously put to him in cross examination that he
ought sell up all or part of
his real estate, employ an investment adviser and receive a higher rate of
return on his capital, I
can only say that I think the suggestion unwarranted
in face of the fact that, by his own adherence to investment in real estate,
in
which he has some experience, he has fostered his assets successfully.  It
seems to me that he has a need to pay off his remaining
mortgage debt and to
have some reserve fund.
<P>

46	I therefore find that each of Brenda, Barry, Graham and Peter is left
without adequate provision made by the testator.
<P>

<b>Conclusions:  the second stage</b>
<P>

47	I have already indicated that I do not think any conduct on the part of any
of those four plaintiffs weighs against him or her
having an order made for
provision out of the testator's estate.  I am of the view that the provision
which is appropriate is, for
Brenda, a sum which will give her an additional
reserve fund and may be used (together, if she chooses, with capital released
from
her present accommodation on a move to a smaller dwelling) to provide her
with income.  In the case of Barry, I am of the view that
the appropriate sum
is one which will permit him to buy a house for his family in Queensland (the
evidence being that houses are
available there in the range of $120,000 to
$150,000), to clear his debts and to have some small reserve fund.  I am of the
view
that the appropriate sum in the case of Graham is a sum which will provide
him with greater liquidity and a reserve fund.  I am of
the view that the sum
in the case of Peter is a sum which will permit him to pay out the mortgage
indebtedness on his properties
and other indebtedness and have some reserve
fund.
<P>

48	It was suggested on behalf of the defendants that I should divide the estate
into an appropriate number of units (a thoughtful
draft was provided to me by
counsel) which could be, as it were, redistributed among the beneficiaries
according to their deserts.
 This would also facilitate the implementation of
protective trusts in respect of those family members who, it was submitted,
were
in need of them.  In view of the quantum of the estate, and of the
provision which I propose to make under the FPA, I do not think
this is
necessary.  Another reason for avoiding this course is that it is important to
interfere with the testamentary provisions
only so far as is necessary to make
the provision which the Court deems to be called for under the FPA; the
implementation of such
a complete scheme, unless rendered necessary by the call
for provision, risks either effecting the actuality or giving the appearance
of
a complete rewriting of the will.  I do not, therefore, propose to follow that
course.
<P>

49	I assess the sums in which provision ought be made for the plaintiffs as
$220,000 for Barry and $120,000 each for Brenda, Graham
and Peter.
<P>

<b>Approval of Settlement</b>
<P>

50	The settlement entered into by the defendants in respect of Barbara's claim
was in my view an appropriate and proper settlement
at the time it was entered
into.  It continues to be so in light of the provision I propose to make for
the other plaintiffs and
ought be approved under s 31 of the FPA, and I propose
to do so.
<P>

<b>Portion of the estate which should bear the provision for the
plaintiffs</b>
<P>

51	The settlement for Barbara I have approved on the basis stated in the
agreement, that she should take the benefit of the fund
thereby provided in
addition to her 1/15th share of the estate.  It follows, of course, that her
1/15th portion should not bear the
burden of the provision proposed to be made
for the four successful plaintiffs.  In addition, I am of the view that the
provision
made of a 1/15th share of the estate made for each of John and Joseph
was proper provision for them and should not be disturbed;
therefore, neither
will those portions bear the burden of the provision now to be made.
<P>

52	The provision now to be made (including Barbara's $100,000) totals $680,000.
This leaves the 12 remaining 1/15th shares, one
of which is left to Colleen and
the other 11 to the grandchildren, to bear the provision.  Should they bear the
provision equally,
or in some other proportion?  It has been submitted on
behalf of the contesting plaintiffs that John and Colleen should between them
be entitled to only one share, and that Colleen's share should be eliminated
entirely.  I do not think it should.  The estate is
well able to meet the
provision that I propose without eliminating Colleen's share.  As I have said,
the testator's testamentary
intentions should not be disturbed more than is
necessary to make the provision that the Court deems proper.  It is clear that
the
testator was grateful to Colleen for care and support which was undoubtedly
given by her.  There is no reason in my view why her
share should bear the
provision ahead of the shares of the grandchildren.  Among the grandchildren,
it is said that Brian (16) and
Jason (17) have some disability and Andrew (18)
and Rachel (19) are still infants.  It is suggested that the shares of those
four
should be spared the incidence of the provision.  However, each of the
remaining 12 residuary beneficiaries, if their shares be not
further
diminished, will receive about $60,000, which is a substantial gift.  I have
already expressed the view that none of the
12 is under any particular
disability, with one exception.  That one is Brian, whose mental incapacity
substantially deprives him
of capacity to earn income or look after himself.  I
propose that my orders should leave his share substantially untouched, but that
otherwise the shares of Colleen and the grandchildren should bear the incidence
of the provision to be made, and bear it equally
among them.
<P>

<b>Special Trust Provisions</b>
<P>

53	It has been submitted strongly that the provision for Barry and, less
strongly, that the provision for Peter should be put into
some form of
protective trust.  In Barry's case, it is said that he is quite improvident and
has lost all his substance.  Evidence
has been led of what is said to be his
mismanagement of the two businesses in which he was involved.  Certainly it is
clear on the
evidence that they produced burgeoning debts.  There is some,
although not very satisfactory evidence, of deficiencies in Barry's
management
practices.  In my view, there is not enough evidence to come to any firm
conclusion about the reasons for the failure
of the businesses or the part of
Barry's management in that failure.  Barry says that he does not intend again
to engage in business,
and his mode of life in recent years, his health and his
age indicate that this is likely to be so.  There is some evidence of a
spending spree after receipt of the settlement of his father's estate.
However, overall I am of the view that the evidence is not
sufficient to
warrant the placement of the provision for Barry in any form of protective
trust, rather than being made simply in
the form of a legacy to him.  So far as
Stephen is concerned, the gift to him is not made by the Court, but by the will
(though diminished
in quantum by the provision made by the Court).  I do not
think it is any part of the function of the Court in carrying out its functions
under the FPA to intervene in a gift made by the will so as to make it proof
against the creditors of a bankrupt beneficiary and
I do not propose to do
anything in this regard.  It may be better that the gifts to grandchildren
which need to continue in the hands
of trustees, ie, those to Brian, Andrew and
Rachel should now be framed as gifts in specific sums vested in ongoing
trustees for
those persons.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

54	Short minutes of order ought be brought in to give effect to my decision.
Further submissions will be received at that time if
any additional orders are
sought concerning the incidence of the provision made by the Court, in relation
to the operation of the
gifts for the residuary beneficiaries (including the
form of the gifts to Brian, Andrew and Rachael), as to costs and as to any
incidental
matters.  They can be dealt with when short minutes are brought
in.
