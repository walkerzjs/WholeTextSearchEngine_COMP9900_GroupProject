LIMITED &amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

<b><u>introduction</u></b>
<P>

1  	On 3 December 1992, the Federal Court of Australia made orders
that the first plaintiff, Amann Aviation Pty Ltd, be wound up,
and that the
second plaintiff, Martin Russell Brown, be appointed liquidator.
<P>

2  	On 19 April 1996, the plaintiffs filed a statement of claim in
these proceedings against various defendants, including Mr Vanda
Gould who was
a director of the first plaintiff.
<P>

3  	As a result of proceedings in the High Court in the case of <u>Re
Brown:  Ex Parte Amann</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20839" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 839</a>, an order was made by the High
Court on 17 June 1999, and amended on 19 August 1999, prohibiting Mr Brown and
others from taking
any further steps in the Federal Court under the order for
winding up the first plaintiff.
<P>

4  	I am dealing with a Notice of Motion filed by the defendants in
these proceedings on 20 August 1999, seeking an order that these
proceedings be
dismissed, struck out, or permanently stayed.  
<P>

5  	This application raises two broad issues.  Firstly, leaving aside
any effect of the Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act
(1999) (NSW), does
the decision and order of the High Court mean that Mr Brown either is
prohibited from pursuing these proceedings
or else has no standing to pursue
them?  Secondly, if yes to that question, is that position overcome by the
Federal Courts (State
Jurisdiction) Act (1999)?  Notice has been given under
Section 78B of the Judiciary Act to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth
and States.  There has been intervention by the Attorney General for the
Commonwealth and the Attorney General for the State of New
South Wales.
<P>

6  	The only additional facts that I need to note are the following.

<P>

7  	Amann Aviation Pty Ltd was incorporated in New South Wales and
remains incorporated in New South Wales.  
<P>

8  	The actual terms of the relevant Federal Court orders made on 3
December 1992 were as follows:  
<P>

<b><i>1.	Amann Aviation Pty. Ltd. be wound up by this Court under the
provisions of the Corporations Law.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>2.	Mr. Martin Brown of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, 580 George Street, Sydney,
New South Wales, 2000, an official liquidator, be appointed
the liquidator of
the affairs of the said company.</i></b>
<P>

9  	As I have already recorded, on 17 June 1999 the High Court gave
its decision in<b> </b><u>Re Brown:  Ex Parte Amann</u>, which is in fact
reported along with  a number of cases then decided, under the name<b>
</b><u>Re Wakim; Ex Parte McNally</u><b> (</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1999%29%2073%20ALJR%20839" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1999) 73 ALJR 839.</a>  The only
passage in the judgment of the High Court which has particular relevance to
this application appears at paragraphs 164
and 165 of the joint judgment of
Gummow and Hayne JJ: 
<P>

<b><i>Mr. Amann's application for certiorari to quash are also out of time.
But because he was not a party to the earlier litigation, he
is not affected by
the same considerations that touch Mr. Gould's application for extension of
time.  If the time for making Mr.
Amann's applications for certiorari is not
extended, the orders which it is sought to impugn will stand.  But if
prohibition goes
to prohibit further steps under one of those orders - the
order for winding up - a curious result would ensue:  an order that the
company
be wound up by the court would stand, but no step could be taken in the Federal
Court to give further effect to it.  In our
view, prohibition should issue to
prohibit further steps in the Federal Court under the order for winding up.  It
was an order made
without jurisdiction and further effect should not now be
given to it by that Court.  Nevertheless, the order for winding up should
not
be quashed.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>It is more than six years since the winding up order was made.  During
that time, Mr. Brown has acted as liquidator and has incurred
expenses in the
winding up, including, presumably, costs and expenses associated with this
litigation.  Of more significance, however,
is the consideration that third
parties may well have acquired rights that would be affected if the winding up
order were now to
be quashed.  It not having been shown that third parties will
not be adversely affected if the winding up order were to be quashed,
the
discretion to extend the time for applying for certiorari to quash the winding
up order should be refused.</i></b>
<P>

The other judges of the majority agreed  with those passages.
<P>

10  	Order 3 made by the High Court on 17 June 1999 was in the
following terms:
<P>

<b><i>On the application of the first-named applicant, order absolute in the
first instance for a writ of prohibition prohibiting the respondents
from
taking any further steps in the winding up of Amann Aviation Pty. Limited (in
liq.).</i></b>
<P>

11  	A Notice of Motion was brought under the slip rule to vary that
order by adding, after the words "any further steps in the"
and before the
words "winding up of Amann Aviation Pty Limited (In Liq)", the words "Federal
Court under the order for".  That Notice
of Motion was heard on 19 August 1999
by Gaudron J.  In the course of hearing the Notice of Motion, her Honour made
some remarks
which I will set out later.  Her Honour acceded to the application
and, in the result, the relevant order ultimately made by the
High Court was in
the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>On the application of the first-named applicant, order absolute in the
first instance for a writ of prohibition prohibiting the respondents
from
taking any further steps in the Federal Court under the order for winding up of
Amann Aviation Pty. Limited (in liq.).</i></b>
<P>

12  	After hearing full argument on the first issue that I
identified, I have come to a decision on that issue favourable to the
plaintiffs.  There has been no suggestion that the remedial Act to which I
referred could take away the right and standing of the
liquidator to bring
these proceedings, if he otherwise had it.  If it should turn out in an Appeal
Court that I am in error on the
first issue, plainly it will be open to an
Appeal Court to consider the second issue, whether or not I come to any
decision on it.
It seems to me that a prompt resolution of this matter is
desirable.
<P>

13  	Mr Bennett QC, Solicitor General for the Commonwealth, and Mr
Sexton SC, Solicitor General for the State of New South Wales,
both supported
the view that if I came to such a decision on the first issue, I need not
proceed to consider the second issue.  That
was opposed by Mr Rares SC for the
applicant and Mr Robb QC for the plaintiffs.  However, I have come to the view
that it is appropriate
for me to decide the case on the first issue, without
hearing further submissions on the second issue.  
<P>

14  	I have been provided with extensive written submissions by all
parties, which I will leave with the papers.  I will be brief
in referring to
oral submissions.
<P>

15  	I find it convenient to divide the first issue up into three
sub-issues.  Firstly, what does the order of the Federal Court
mean?  Secondly,
what would be the position now, with the Federal Court's lack of jurisdiction
established, leaving aside the effect
of the actual order made by the High
Court?  Thirdly, what is the effect on that position, if any, of the order of
the High Court?
<P>

<b><u>INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL COURT ORDER</u></b>
<P>

16  	There are two questions that arise in the interpretation of the
Federal Court order.  First, what is meant by the words "wound
up by this
Court"; and second, what is meant by the words "under the provisions of the
Corporations Law"?  
<P>

17  	Dealing first with the second question, it seems to me plain
that the Corporations Law there means the Corporations Law of
New South Wales,
because it is that Law which deals with the winding up of companies
incorporated in New South Wales.  
<P>

18  	Coming to the first question, Mr Rares submitted  that what it
means is that the Federal Court ordered that the Federal Court
itself should,
by its officer the liquidator, carry out the ongoing process of winding up the
company.  He referred me to<b> </b><u>Ogilvie Grant v East</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%207%20ACLR%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 7 ACLR
669</a> at 672, where McPherson J said that it was established that the winding up
of a company was an "administration conducted by the court".
 He also referred
me to statements to somewhat similar effect in<b> </b><u>Franklins Self-Serve
Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</u><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20125%20CLR%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 125 CLR 52</a> at
69-70 and<b> </b><u>Deloitte V Touche AG v Johnson</u> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1999/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] UKPC 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%201%20WLR%201605" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 1 WLR 1605</a> at
161-162.  
<P>

19  	These cases do plainly establish that winding up by a court is
an administration pursuant to an elaborate statutory scheme,
conducted under
the supervision of the Court by a liquidator who is an officer of the Court;
but in my opinion, it is a mistake to
say that the whole process of winding up
is literally conducted <i>by</i> the Court.
<P>

20  	The Corporations Law uses the expression "winding up by the
Court" in the headings of Part 5.4A and 5.4B.  It provides that
in certain
circumstances, the Court may order a company to be wound up.  It gives the
Court an extensive role in the subsequent processes
of winding up, in relation
to such matters as the removal of liquidators, approval of compromises, giving
directions to liquidators,
staying or terminating the winding up, ordering the
delivery of property, making calls on contributories, and fixing a day for
proof
of claims.  There is also provision that some of these powers may (by
rules) be given to the liquidator for exercise by the liquidator.
 
<P>

21  	However, in my opinion, it is plain that the ongoing process of
winding up is actually conducted by the liquidator.  In my
opinion, it is plain
that the liquidator does not act as the Court's agent in doing this.  To say
that the liquidator is an officer
of the Court is not the same as to say that
the liquidator is the agent of the Court.  Solicitors and barristers are said
to be officers
of the court in conducting cases in Court, but it would be
absurd to say that they are therefore agents of the Court.
<P>

22  	In this case, the Federal Court appointed a liquidator, and
under that order it became the obligation of that liquidator to
wind up the
company under the supervision of the Court.  That, in my opinion, is the effect
of the Corporations Law, and the order
of the Court was that the winding up be
under the Corporations Law.  It is for those reasons that I have said that the
words "wound
up by the Court" do not mean that the Court should actually
conduct the process of winding up either by itself or by an agent. 
<P>

23  	The words of the order, "wound up by this Court", could mean
that the Federal Court, and the Federal Court alone, is to carry
out the
Court's supervisory role to which I have referred.  However, in the absence of
any special reason to make such an order,
such an order would plainly have been
contrary to s.58AA of the Corporations Law, combined with various provisions of
the Corporations
(NSW) Act 1990, and in particular ss.44 and 46 of that Act.
These sections are in the following terms:
<P>

<P>

<b><i>(2)	Except where there is a clear expression of a contrary intention (for
example, by use of the expression "the Court"), proceedings
in relation to a
matter under this Law may, subject to the Acts mentioned in subsection (3), be

<P>

<b><i>(3)	The jurisdiction that courts have in relation to a matter under this

<P>

<P>

<b><i>46.	All courts having jurisdiction in civil matters arising under the
Corporations Law of New South Wales and the officers of, or
under the control

<P>

24  	It would also have been contrary to the decision of the Full
Federal Court in <u>Acton Engineering Pty Ltd v Campbell</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/469.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 469</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2031%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 31 FCR 1.</a>
Although the jurisdiction of the Federal Court asserted in that decision has
now been authoritatively negatived by the High Court
decision in<b>
</b><u>Wakim</u>, there was, of course, no suggestion that that was the case
back in 1992.  
<P>

25  	In that case, a company had been ordered to be wound up by the
Supreme Court of Queensland.  A creditor applied to the Federal
Court for leave
to bring proceedings against the company, and also appealed to the Federal
Court against a decision of the liquidator.
 The Full Federal Court held that
the Federal Court did have jurisdiction to deal with these applications.
Lockhart J, with whom
Black CJ and Davies J agreed, held in substance that
under the national system put in place in 1989 and 1990, the powers of the
Court
in respect to a winding up could be exercised by any court with
jurisdiction in such matters, not just by the court that made the
winding up
order.
<P>

26  	As I noted, it is now established that that decision was wrong
in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, but as
I have also said,
that was not established then, and the decision remains, in other respects, at
the very least, very highly persuasive.
 If there is any other reasonable
interpretation that can be given to the words "wound up by this Court", I would
lean very strongly
against interpreting an order made by a single judge or
registrar as being contrary to the statutory provisions and to a clear decision
of the Full Federal Court.
<P>

27  	The other possible interpretation is that the order simply means
that the winding up process is initiated by the Federal Court.
 That would make
the words something of a tautology, but tautologies of that nature are not
uncommon.  For example, one sometimes
finds orders along the lines of order
that the company "hereby be wound up" or words to that effect.  Given the
choice between tautology
and error, in this case I would prefer tautology.  
<P>

28  	For those reasons, in my opinion, on its proper construction,
the order means no more than the winding up process is initiated
by the Federal
Court.
<P>

<b><u>EFFECT OF LACK OF JURISDICTION</u></b>
<P>

29  	The second question is, what the position would now be, with the
Federal Court's lack of jurisdiction established but leaving
aside the actual
order made by the High Court.  
<P>

30  	It is common ground that, although the High Court decision in
<u>Re Wakim</u> means that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction to make its
order, the Federal Court is a superior court of record, so its order
is valid
and binding until set aside or quashed.  So the situation is, leaving aside the
actual High Court order, that this is a
valid and binding order that the
company be wound up, and a valid and binding order appointing Mr Brown
liquidator.  The inability
of the Federal Court to take any further role in the
winding up is now clear, because its lack of jurisdiction has been
established.
<P>

31  	Prima facie in those circumstances, the national scheme and the
decision in<b> </b><u>Acton</u> would suggest that, in relation to a New South
Wales company, it would be entirely appropriate that the New South Wales
Supreme Court
could continue whatever supervisory role was required in the
winding up.
<P>

32  	Mr Rares submitted that the decision in<b> </b><u>Acton</u> was
wrong, and that anyway it cannot apply because the national scheme, including
in particular s.46 of the Corporations (NSW) Act
1990. does not apply to the
Federal Court.
<P>

33  	As I have already indicated, it is clear that<b>
</b><u>Acton</u> was wrong in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal
Court; and I accept that the national scheme, including s.46, can no longer
be
considered as applying to the Federal Court.  However,<b> </b><u>Acton</u> is
still at least a highly persuasive authority as to the effect of the scheme as
between State courts, and also for the general
proposition that a liquidator is
not to be considered as an officer exclusively of the Court which made the
winding up order.  Not
only is<b> </b><u>Acton</u> a persuasive authority on
those matters, but I myself respectfully agree with it.
<P>

34  	The situation, apart from the High Court order, is that there is
here a company ordered to be wound up under the New South
Wales Corporations
Law.  A liquidator has been appointed.  The powers of the directors are
suspended.  The winding up is not completed.
 The Federal Court is precluded by
its lack of jurisdiction from continuing any supervisory role, so that there
could not conceivably
be any inference with the jurisdiction of the Federal
Court or any indication of lack of comity for the Supreme Court of New South
Wales to take over the supervisory role.
<P>

35  	There is in place a national scheme where a winding up ordered
by the Supreme Court of one State can, in appropriate circumstances,
be
supervised by the Supreme Court of another State; so that as I have indicated,
the liquidator plainly is not to be considered
an officer exclusively of the
Court that made the winding up order.
<P>

36  	The New South Wales Supreme Court is a court of unlimited
jurisdiction, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> confirms that it has all the
jurisdiction necessary to the administration of justice in New South Wales.
Plainly, the New South Wales
Supreme Court has jurisdiction to carry out all
the functions given to the Court by the New South Wales Corporations Law in
relation
to this winding up.
<P>

37  	Mr Rares made the further submission that, before the winding up
could continue in any way, there would need to be an application
made by the
liquidator to the Supreme Court whereby in effect the Supreme Court takes over
the supervision of the liquidation.  In
my opinion, that is not necessary.
There is nothing to stop the liquidator going ahead with the winding up.  He
has duties under
the Corporations Law which should continue to be fulfilled.
If and when it becomes necessary for supervision to be exercised, the
jurisdiction of the New South Wales Supreme Court could be invoked and the
liquidator would then  plainly be treated as an officer
of the New South Wales
Supreme Court.  I would add that, even if an application of that kind were
necessary, the other reasons I
have given would plainly make it inappropriate
to stay or dismiss these proceedings.
<P>

38  	I might also add that it seems to me that the situation as I
have outlined it will in fact be the situation in relation to
the generality of
winding up orders made by the Federal Court, unless and until they are set
aside.  If anything remains to be done
under such an order, in my opinion it
can be done under the supervision of the Supreme Court of the State in which
the relevant company
was incorporated.
<P>

<b><u>EFFECT OF HIGH COURT ORDER</u></b>
<P>

39  	I come now to the third question, namely, does the High Court
order make any difference to this position? 
<P>

40  	I have already mentioned that it is common ground that, although
it is established that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction,
that still leaves
the Federal Court order as an order of a superior court of record, and thus as
a valid and binding order. It also
seems plain that the High Court has not done
anything which would set aside or quash the order itself, so that the order
remains
valid and binding.  
<P>

41  	There was some discussion during submissions as to whether the
actual order made by the High Court could operate in the same
way as a stay of
a winding up order.  It seems clear that a stay of a winding up order has the
effect that the winding up order is
itself deprived of continuing effect, so
that the appointment of the liquidator is no longer sustained and control of
the company
returns to the directors:  see <u>Austral Brick Co Pty Ltd v Falgat
Constructions Pty Ltd </u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 389.</a>  As one alternative submission,
Mr Rares put that the High Court order had a similar effect.  In my opinion it
is clear that it does
not.  All it does is to prohibit identified persons from
taking any step in the Federal Court.  In my opinion, that could not be
considered as having the effect of returning the control of the company to the
directors.
<P>

42  	Mr Rares' principal submission was that the High Court order
meant that nothing more could be done in the winding up, because
to do anything
more in the winding up would involve taking steps in the Federal Court contrary
to the High Court's order.  As I understand
it, it was put in two ways.  
<P>

43  	Firstly it was put that, because the Federal Court ordered that
the winding up be by the Federal Court, and because the liquidator
was an
officer of the Federal Court, therefore anything that the liquidator does in
pursuance of the winding up is done by the Federal
Court and in the Federal
Court.  That submission depends upon a construction of the Federal Court order
which, for reasons I have
given, I do not accept.
<P>

44  	The second way Mr Rares put the submission was that the Federal
Court order meant that the winding up was to be pursued by
the liquidator as an
officer of the Federal Court, and under the supervision of the Federal Court.
Since the High Court order precludes
the exercise of that supervision and
therefore also precludes the liquidator acting as an officer of the Federal
Court, and this
in turn precludes him from pursuing the winding up.  This is
because either he has no standing on behalf of the company, or it would
be an
abuse of process to continue with any aspect of the winding up.  Again, in my
opinion, that submission depends upon a construction
of the Federal Court order
which I have rejected.  For the reasons I have already given, in my opinion the
winding up can be pursued
without steps being taken in the Federal Court.
<P>

45  	(I would add to my reasons given orally the point that, even if
my view on the construction of the Federal Court's order were
incorrect, the
same result would follow.  If the Federal Court's order on its true
construction required that for the future the
Federal Court and the Federal
Court alone should supervise the winding up, it would be requiring what is now
demonstrated to be a
legal impossibility.  Even an order of a superior court
which has not been set aside cannot validly require a legal impossibility
to
occur in the future:  in that respect, there would be a distinction between so
much of the order as ordered that the company be
wound up, which was not a
legal impossibility, and so much of it as required that for the future the
Federal Court supervise the
winding up, which is, and is now known to be, a
legal impossibility.  It would be as if the court had ordered a person to draw
a
rectangle and also to draw a square circle:  even a superior court cannot
effectively require the latter.  This argument applies
a fortiori to the
present case, because even if the Federal Court order could otherwise have
effectively required that for the future
the Federal Court and the Federal
Court alone supervise the winding up, the High Court order in this case would
override it.)
<P>

46  	The final matter raised concerning the effect of the High Court
order relates to the statements made by justices of the High
Court themselves
in relation to the matter.  I have quoted the relevant parts of the judgments
in<b> </b><u>Re</u><b> </b><u>Wakim</u>,<b> </b>and as I understand it, there
was no significant submission on either side that they really assisted very
much in determining the
questions before this Court.  However, at the hearing
before Gaudron J, there were some exchanges which might be thought to have
some
bearing on the question.
<P>

47  	Firstly, there was an exchange between Mr Rares and Gaudron J in
the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>MR. RARES:  The legislation clearly sets out a statutory scheme for
winding up by the court and once there is prohibition to be issued,
we submit
that the formulation of the order by the Court as in the pamphlet, without the
assistance of the Australian or other law
reports, is correct, that really what
the Court is ordering is that there be no further steps pursuant to an order
made without jurisdiction,
by either of the relevant respondents for whom my
learned friend appears.  That is perfectly in conformity with the reasons and
---</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>HER HONOUR:  It may mean that there is no difference, in
effect.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>MR. RARES:  It may, but we are cautious that our learned friends are
seeking to take some point about it.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>HER HONOUR:  They are seeking to preserve their rights to proceed
elsewhere in the event of remedial legislation which I should have
thought was
what the judgment was at least hypothesising - which possibility was being
hypothesised in what was said.</i></b>
<P>

48  	A little later, in response to a submission by Mr Rares that
further steps could not be taken in the winding up anywhere else
other than the
Federal Court, her Honour said "at the moment".  This suggests that her Honour
was directing her mind, in acceding
to the application to amend the order, to
the limitation that might be placed by the unamended order in the event that
there were
to be remedial legislation which would somehow enable the liquidator
to take action.  
<P>

49  	However, in my opinion, nothing in those exchanges suggests
anything like a considered view that, without the remedial legislation,
the
liquidator could not take steps anywhere else other than the Federal Court.  I
do not consider those exchanges sufficient to
affect the views I have already
expressed.  
<P>

50  	For those reasons, in my opinion, the application should be
dismissed with costs.
<P>

51  	Mr Rares has submitted that I did not deal with submissions that
he made about the effect of the passages which I quoted from
the joint judgment
of Gummow and Hayne JJ in<b> </b><u>Re Wakim</u>.  He submitted that they
disclosed an intention that nothing more be done in the future under the
winding up order, and that this
was reinforced by the circumstance that the
High Court set aside examination orders that had been made by the Federal Court
in relation
to the winding up.
<P>

52  	Dealing with the latter aspect first, the examination orders
were set aside because, irrespective of the validity or invalidity
of the
original winding up order, the Federal Court did not have jurisdiction to make
the examination orders.  The High Court considered
it was appropriate, in
circumstances where the examinations had been completed, to set aside the
orders, so that the question of
what was to be  done about information obtained
from those examinations could be appropriately considered if and when it
arises.
<P>

53  	As regard the intention that nothing more be done in the winding
up, Mr Rares pointed to the reference to "a curious result"
in paragraph 164,
and submitted that, if another court could simply take over the winding up as I
have suggested, the result would
not really be so curious.  Secondly, he
pointed to the circumstance that the reason given for not setting aside the
winding up order
was primarily related to incurring of expenses and rights of
third parties that may have arisen in the past.  In those ways, he submitted,
the judgment manifested a plain intention that nothing more should happen in
the future.  
<P>

54  	There is some force in that submission, but in my opinion, there
is nothing in the passages to suggest that their Honours considered
the
question whether another court could, in effect, take over the supervision of
the winding up, or come to any conclusion on this
question.  It seems to me
therefore that this matter does not really affect the reasons I have previously
given. 
<P>

55  	I order that the Notice of Motion filed 20 August 1999 be
dismissed.  
<P>

56  	I order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of the
Notice of Motion but not the cost of the intervenors.
<P>

57  	I will stand this matter over to the registrar's list on 17
March 2000.  
<P>

58  	I extend the time for the filing of a defence until 24 March
2000.
