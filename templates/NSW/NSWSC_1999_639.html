<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Costs)</b>
<P>

1   	Further to my orders made on 23 June 1999 (NSWSC 619:
DLJT: 44), the plaintiff seeks costs.  
<P>

2   	I granted leave to the defendant to amend its case on
justification and dismissed the plaintiff's Motion to set aside the defendant's
subpoena to the New South Wales Police Service (paragraph 531).
<P>

3   	The defendant, by reason of its success on each of the
relevant Motions, also seeks costs.
<P>

4   	I gave further directions for the conduct of the case on 25
June 1999 (DLJT:  45).  On that day I heard submissions from Mr
Reynolds S.C.
and Mr Wheelhouse.  They were not lengthy.  I decided to keep the time spent on
costs arguments brief to maintain some
sensible degree of proportion and
fairness given the duration of the hearing (see dates noted on cover sheet of
DLJT: 44).
<P>

5   	The plaintiff contends that the "<i>usual" </i>orders for
costs should be made consequent upon the defendant being granted leave to
amend.  Those usual orders are the costs of the
amendment application itself,
costs occasioned by the amendment and any costs arising from the adjournment.

<P>

6   	It is also sought that the order for costs be on an
indemnity basis.  It was candidly acknowledged that an order of this nature
would be exceptional, but it was submitted that the circumstances attending the
application itself and its consequences warrant the
making of this kind of
order.  This is especially so given the duration and expense, the massive
"<i>transmogrification" </i>of the defendant's case consequent upon the grant
of leave and the proposition that without such an order costs would not
operate,
in justice, as "<i>compensatory</i>".
<P>

7   	It is submitted for the plaintiff that the amendment
application and the subpoena application were so intertwined that there
was no
point in drawing any fine, or any distinction at all, for the purposes of
making any costs order. I agree with the submission
(see paragraphs 186, 216
and 235, for example, of my judgment of 23 June 1999).
<P>

8   	For the defendant costs are sought and, indeed it was
suggested, there would be an entitlement on an indemnity basis, by reason
of
the nature of the allegations made by the plaintiff in opposition to the
amendment and in support of his subpoena application
(see paragraph 293 of my
judgment).  The charges made were so serious, it is said, the cross-examination
of the defendant's witnesses
especially Mr Angus went no way to support them.
My findings in favour of the defendant on all the principal issues, it is said,
warrant orders in favour of that party.  It was conceded however that the
entitlement to the plaintiff would be limited to any costs
occasioned by the
amendment restricted to any pleading requirements.
<P>

9   	It was also argued that this was not a case, nor is there
any case, where a defendant should be "<i>punished</i>" or a plaintiff
"<i>rewarded"</i> by the nature of any orders for costs.  With this proposition
I, of course, agree.
<P>

10   	With a candour that can only command respect, Mr Reynolds
S.C. (T1855.5 and .30) informed the Court of the frankly perilous
situation of
Mr Marsden vis-a-vis his legal advisers on the matter of outstanding costs.  At
T1856.15 I myself acknowledged the reality
as did Mr Wheelhouse at T1856.25.
Mr Reynolds indicated that what he said could be supported by affidavit and I
accept that.
<P>

11   	The discretion as to the making of orders for costs must
be exercised judicially uninfluenced by candid and impassioned pleas
or matters
of sympathy.
<P>

12   	From the point of view of the defendant I note the
following:  first, the defendant succeeded in its application to amend.
 It did
not however succeed to the extent sought.  The defendant failed to
particularise any case in relation to D25 and thus that
amendment was refused.
The defendant did not succeed in maintaining the overall integrity of its
subpoena (although I exercised my
discretion not to set it aside).  Importantly
the defendant did not succeed in sustaining the particularisation of its case
as sought
to be amended by reason of my rulings striking out a body of
particulars as irrelevant or scurrilous.  The defendant did succeed
in respect
to the "<i>psychiatric</i>" component and had the benefit of a finding by me of
acceptance of Mr Angus' testimony.
<P>

13   	From the plaintiff's point of view I make it clear that
whilst his position was both opened and closed "<i>high</i>" in terms of the
nature of the allegations he made against the defendant, the conduct of the
cross-examination of Mr Angus was appropriate,
in no way improper and in the
circumstances was reasonable.  The plaintiff had consented to a great body of
amendments the defendant
wished to make.  The plaintiff can be characterised as
having taken a reasonable approach to that component.  The plaintiff's
"<i>indignation</i>" as to the D17 - D25 proposed amendments as I indicated in
my judgment (paragraph 520), was understandable.  On any view the amendments
ultimately allowed, D17 - D24, do effect a substantial change to the
defendant's case and thus the case the plaintiff has to meet.
 Further, there
was an understanding reached that irrespective of the outcome of the nub of the
defendant's application in relation
to D17 to D25 the plaintiff would be
entitled to an adjournment.  
<P>

14   	As was submitted for the plaintiff in the normal course,
the judge deals with an amendment application and almost in a "<i>summary"</i>
way makes the usual orders consequent upon any grant of leave.  The duration of
this particular application legitimately prosecuted
by the defendant and
legitimately, as I have found, resisted by the plaintiff, should make no
difference.
<P>

15   	The defendant argued that its case was not a matter of
<i>indulgence</i>".  I found that the defendant had, in effect, received a
"<i>windfall</i>".  Mr Reynolds made the telling submission, in my view, that
the defendant had received a "<i>windfall</i>" but it was a "<i>windfall</i>"
of which advantage could only be taken upon the grant of leave.
<P>

16   	I also accept the submission for the plaintiff that if an
order is made that encompasses costs "<i>thrown away</i>" by reason of the
adjournment, whether, in fact, there are any such costs will be a matter for
the assessor.  A similar proposition
applies to costs of the amendment.  
<P>

17   	The mere duration of the application, of course, by
itself, is not sufficient to deprive the plaintiff of an order for costs
if he
is otherwise entitled.  Nor is the intensity with which the application was
opposed.  I have found the opposition to the "<i>nub</i>" of the amendment
application to have been reasonable.
<P>

18   	The factors that I have referred to above persuade me that
no case has been made to preclude the plaintiff from obtaining
the usual order
for costs upon the defendant's grant of leave to amend.  That usual order will
be inclusive of costs of the amendment
application (that application to be
taken as to include the application in relation to the subpoena by reason of
their being so intertwined),
the costs occasioned by the amendment and the
costs occasioned by the adjournment which I ordered on 25 June 1999.
<P>

19   	The dimensions of this litigation can only be described as
enormous.  The burden of its conduct and management on both sides
are great.
The defendant has applied for and has been granted leave substantially to
expand its case the duration of which has been
estimated to take up to one
year.  I consider it fair and appropriate in all the circumstances that the
plaintiff have the benefit
of orders under SCR Pt52A rr 8 and 9. 
<P>

20   	I am not persuaded however in the light of the analysis I
have sought to make of all the matters affecting the exercise of
my discretion,
that a case has been made for an order for costs on an indemnity basis as
opposed to a party and party basis.  In
all the circumstances to make an order
in the form sought by the plaintiff could be perceived as "<i>punishing</i>"
the defendant.
<P>

21   	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the application
leading to the orders made by me on 23 June 1997.
<P>

2.	I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs occasioned both by the
amendment and the adjournment.
<P>

3.	I order pursuant to SCR Pt 52A rules 8 and 9 that such costs upon assessment
forthwith be payable.
<P>

4.	I publish my reasons.
<P>

5.	Liberty to apply on 24 hour's notice if necessary to my associate by phone
at Grafton or Wagga Wagga.
