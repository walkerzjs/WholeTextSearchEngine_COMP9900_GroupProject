<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:	
<P>

1   	What is to be dealt with this morning is the costs of these
proceedings and the appropriate manner of their final disposal.
 In the
proceedings I have dealt with applications for relief and issues relating to
certain machines in the failed West Bellambi
Colliery ("the colliery").  The
machines fell into two categories.  The first category was a Joy Continuous
Miner and in the second
category were machines known as Un-a-Haulers ("the
Un-a-Haulers").  The plaintiff was the mortgagee under a mortgage of the Joy
Continuous
Miner ("the mortgage") and entitled to its possession by reason of
the first defendant's default under the mortgage.  The plaintiff
was also the
lessor of the Un-a-Haulers. The first defendant was the operator of the
colliery and was the owner and mortgagor of
the Joy Continuous Miner.  The
second defendant was the holder of the coal lease under which the colliery was
conducted.  The third
defendant was the lessee of the Un-a-Haulers.  All of
those three defendants were in voluntary administration.  The fourth defendant
was the administrator of the first defendant and the second defendant, but not
of the third defendant.  At different times Mr Coles
of Queen's Counsel and Mr
White of Counsel and Miss M. Williams, solicitor, have appeared for the
plaintiff.  At all times Mr Angyal
of Counsel has appeared for the first,
second and fourth defendants.  There has never at any stage been any appearance
of the third
defendant, which has taken the stance that it consented to the
plaintiff retaking possession of the Un-a-Haulers.  Hereafter in this
judgment
the first, second and fourth defendants are referred to simply as `'the
defendants''.
<P>

2   	As I have indicated, there have only been quite narrow
issues dealt with in the proceedings.  Essentially, the plaintiff applied
by
summons for injunctive relief to assist it in regaining possession of the Joy
Continuous Miner, and the fourth defendant cross
applied by notice of motion
for an order under s 441D(2) of the Corporations Law (`'the Law''), to the
effect that the plaintiff
ought not be permitted to exercise its right of
repossession during the continuation of the administration.  Those issues I
dealt
with in a judgment of 10 September 1999  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/935.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 935.</a>  I refused the
plaintiff the injunctive relief that it sought and granted to the administrator
an order under s 444D(2).  Subsequently,
I dealt with an application by the
plaintiff for injunctive relief to facilitate its taking possession of the
Un-a-Haulers  during
the continuation of the administration of the first
defendant and the second defendant.  Although, as already appears, they had no
direct interest in the Un-a-Haulers, I found that the Un-a-Haulers were in
their possession and, therefore, s 440C of the Law did
apply and the plaintiff
did need leave under that section to repossess them.  Application was made
under that section and the leave
was refused.  This was dealt with in my
judgment of 13 September 1999  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/936.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 936.</a>  That application was in fact
pressed by the plaintiff to hearing on the last day of the administrations.
<P>

3   	At all times it was apparent that the administrations must
come to an end this week, either by the execution of a deed of company
arrangement ("DCA") or, if the DCA were not executed, upon the expiry of the
time specified for its execution.  In fact, the DCA
and the corresponding sale
agreement referred to in my earlier judgments were executed late on Monday 13
September 1999.  By the
time the DCA and sale agreement were executed agreement
had also been reached with the plaintiff as to what was to occur in relation
to
the Joy Continuous Miner.  The effect of that agreement is that Joy Continuous
Miner will remain in the colliery and the purchaser
is to make payment for it
in due course.  Upon part payment being made in about two weeks there is to be
a discharge of the plaintiff's
mortgage over it.  This means that the
plaintiff's future rights in relation to that payment are now rights against
the purchaser
under the sale agreement.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff on the one hand and the defendants on the
other hand now ask for their costs of the proceedings against the other
side.
Mr Angyal, of counsel for the defendants, has given me a succinct written
outline of his submissions on their behalf.  Their
position is put as high as a
submission that the bringing of the proceedings by the plaintiff at the time
and in the circumstances
at which this occurred was an abuse of process.  I do
not think that a proposition as high as that in favour of his clients can be
sustained.  The plaintiff, after all, is a mortgagee under a mortgage in
default and had commenced enforcement action prior to the
commencement of the
administrations, so that s 441B of the Law applied.  However, Mr Angyal has set
out in his submissions a detailed
history of the matter including the public
stances taken by the parties and the negotiations that were going on behind
those stances.
 That history is not contested.  I said at one stage during the
hearing that the proceedings had something of the air of negotiating
parties
circling each other looking for an advantage.  Although Mr Coles of Queen's
Counsel was at the time enthusiastic to accept
this characterisation in
relation to Mr Angyal's clients, in my view his client was at least equally
engaging in that exercise.
<P>

5   	Various considerations militate against the plaintiff's
submissions.  The suggestion put by Mr Coles of Queen's Counsel that
one of the
things to be said against Mr Angyal's clients was that they had left it till
the last moment to apply for relief under
s 441D has no merit.  It was Mr
Coles' client  which initiated the proceedings, and that in a situation where
the administrator had
made it plain at all times that if the plaintiff sought
curial intervention the administrator would then apply to the Court for relief
under s 441D.  It was obviously important from the point of view of the
administrator's negotiations with the purchaser that the
Joy Continuous Miner
be kept in situ until it could be seen whether or not the DCA and sale
agreement would be entered into and whether
or not the purchaser would take the
Joy Continuous Miner under the sale agreement, the purchaser having an option
under its terms
to take it or not to take it.  The action brought by the
plaintiff was brought very late in the day, which adds to the suggestion
that
it was a negotiating tactic.  I also found it very hard to believe on the facts
as proved in this matter that the Joy Continuous
Miner would, in fact, be
removed from the colliery, bearing in mind that the removal was very
inconvenient and the estimates of the
cost of removal ranged between $150,000
and $250,000, as against a value of the machine in the vicinity of $1
million.
<P>

6   	Perhaps Mr Coles' principal submission was that proceedings
under s 441D generally are, and that these certainly were, in the
nature of an
application for an indulgence, so that the general rule in relation to costs
should be that the applicant, even if the
indulgence be granted, should pay the
costs of obtaining it.  He cited well known instances where this rule does
apply, such as the
setting aside of default judgments and the obtaining in
equity of relief against forfeiture.  He also drew attention to proceedings
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 88K</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, where an order for the compulsory
grant of an easement is made subject to a statutory liability for costs.
<P>

7   	In my view s 441D does not provide an instance where the
relief sought can readily, or universally, be characterised as an
indulgence,
such as to attract the operation of such a general rule.  The statute is
specific, that the applicant is not the company,
which is ex hypothesi in
default under its obligations, and so might be thought a supplicant for an
indulgence.  It is the administrator,
who has statutory duties to see if the
company can be restructured or carried on as a viable entity, or at least, as
in the present
instance, to see it the enterprise that it has conducted can
continue life as a viable entity in the hands of a purchaser so that
the
company's return to be shared among its contributories can be maximised by the
disposal of the enterprise as a going concern.
 Part of the policy which the
courts have seen in the legislation in this regard is that the administrator
should not be delayed
or hampered in that task, and another part of that policy
is that the administrator should not be subjected to unnecessary personal
liabilities which might have that effect upon him.  It seems to me that it
would be quite wrong in those circumstances for the courts
to enunciate a rule
that the  administrator should generally pay the costs of obtaining such relief
on the basis that it should be
characterised as an indulgence.  In my view, the
proper general approach is that the costs of such application should be
completely
at large, the discretion in relation to them to be exercised so as
to produce a just result in the widely varying circumstances in
which such
applications may be made.
<P>

8   	In the present case, it seems to me that the proceedings
were in effect conducted as adversary litigation, in which each side
sought to
obtain the result for itself that it desired or thought commercially
beneficial.  The simple fact of the matter is that,
in respect of each of the
applications that was made to the Court, the plaintiff lost and the defendants
won.  In those circumstances
it is my opinion that the correct order for costs
in the circumstances of these proceedings is that they should follow the event,
and that the plaintiff should be ordered to pay the defendants' costs of the
proceedings.
<P>

9   	It is important that it be remembered at all times,
including in coming to a decision as to the appropriate manner of determination
of these proceedings, that the quite narrow issues outlined above were the only
issues contested in these proceedings and are the
only issues that have been
determined by the Court in the judgments which I have delivered.  There may,
potentially, be other issues
between the parties relating to the various
machines.  These have not been raised.  Nor in the context of these
proceedings, conducted
as urgent proceedings in the dying and diminishing days
of this administration, was it appropriate that these other issues be dealt
with.  To take but one instance, even when it was suggested that I should
determine it, I declined to determine the issue as to whether
or not there was
already in force a binding agreement relating to the disposition of the Joy
Continuous Miner as unnecessary to the
disposal of these proceedings.
<P>

10   	In the light of the foregoing, I turn to the appropriate
fate of the proceedings at this stage.  Mr Angyal has asked that
they be
dismissed, so that his clients may be discharged from the trouble and costs of
any further attendances.  Miss Williams, on
behalf of the plaintiff, asks
instead that the proceedings be stood over for three or four weeks to see
whether the terms of the
agreement as to the disposition of the Joy Continuous
Miner be carried into effect.  Miss Williams says that, so long as there is
any
possibility of the exercise of rights under the mortgage, these proceedings
should remain on foot.  However, these proceedings
have been proceedings under
the mortgage only of a very limited scope.  It was never denied that the
mortgage was in default and
 the plaintiff entitled to take possession.  The
only injunctive relief sought was against the first defendant, as former
operator,
and the second defendant, as leaseholder of the colliery, to permit
unfettered access to remove the machine.  If there is default
in the agreement
with the now purchaser, the principal defendant in that claim for relief will
be the purchaser rather than the first
defendant, even if it is a necessary
party as still having an interest in the Joy Continuous Miner.  Whilst it is
possible that the
purchase agreement may not be carried into effect, there
seems to be no reason at the moment to think that it will not.  In all the
circumstances, save for the relief already granted, the appropriate course is
to dismiss the plaintiff's proceedings by summons as
against all defendants.
<P>

11   	I have already indicated that the plaintiff should pay the
defendants' costs of the proceedings in general terms.  Difficult
questions may
arise as to the incidence of that order as it relates to the first and the
second defendants on the one hand, and to
the fourth defendant on the other,
arising out of the first and second defendants' insolvent position and also, in
relation to the
first defendant, out of the fact that it may have other
obligations to the plaintiff under the mortgage.  Those questions do not
need
exploration here, but Mr Angyal has put forward a proposed regime of dissection
whereby he suggests that instead of the costs
being globally ordered in favour
of all three of his clients, the costs of the plaintiff's claims against the
first and second defendants
ought be ordered in favour of the first and second
defendants only, and that the costs of the claim of the fourth defendant, the
administrator under s 441D, ought be ordered in favour of the fourth defendant
alone.  He, after all, alone made that claim and,
under statute, was the only
person who could make that application.  Mr Angyal has also suggested that the
Court ought note, for
the assistance of the parties and any costs assessor,
that approximately equal amounts of time in the proceedings related to the
plaintiff's claims against the first and second defendants on the one hand and
to the fourth defendants' notice of motion on the
other.
<P>

12   	This regime does appeal to me as offering a sensible and
practical solution in the circumstances.  Whilst a great deal of
time and money
could be taken up dissect, or attempting to dissect, what portions of, or
issues in, the proceedings various costs
items were referable to, the equal
distribution suggested, it appears to me, as the person who presided over the
proceedings, to
be reasonably accurate in fact and a fair one in all the
circumstances.  I therefore propose to make the orders in the form propounded
by Mr Angyal.  I shall add a liberty to apply in case further orders are
required of the Court in the spelling out or enforcement
of the costs
orders.
<P>

13   	I propose to dismiss the summons pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Part 40</a> r
8(1), and I shall add at the end of the short minutes, `'5.  Liberty to apply
in respect of costs orders on two days notice''.
 With those alterations, I
make orders in accordance with the short minutes initialled by me and placed
with the papers.
<P>
