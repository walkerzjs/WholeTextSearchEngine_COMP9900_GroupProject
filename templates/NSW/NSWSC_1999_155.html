<b>4525/98 - AUSTRALIAN IMAGING GROUP PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) AND THE
CORPORATIONS LAW;  RODERICK MACKAY SUTHERLAND   V   RICHARD CAMPBELL
BRIEN AND
STEVE NICOLS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 1 March 1999 and revised on 4 March
1999)</b>
<P>

	<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiffs are Mr Sutherland and Australian Imaging Group Pty Ltd (In
Liquidation) (`AIG'), a company which conducted a photo
laboratory business.
Mr Sutherland was the administrator of AIG under a deed of company arrangement.
The plaintiffs' summons seeks
a declaration that money held by Mr Sutherland in
a trust account called the Jirsch Sutherland Trust Account, totalling $149,148,
is held as to $58,354 for the Office of State Revenue and as to $90,794 for the
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation.  The Office of State
Revenue and the Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation are creditors of AIG.  The plaintiffs also seek an
order to pay out those amounts
to the Office of State Revenue and the Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation after deducting expenses.  
<P>

2	The two defendants, Mr Brien and Mr Nicols, are the trustees of the estates
of Harley and Deirdre Roberts respectively, appointed
pursuant to deeds of
assignment under Pt X and s 228 of the Bankruptcy Act.  Mr Roberts was one of
two directors of AIG.  Mrs Roberts,
his wife, was not a director.  By their
cross-claim against Mr Sutherland the defendants seek a declaration that the
total amount
of the fund in the Jirsch Sutherland Trust Account, plus interest,
is payable to them and an order that payment be made.  By his
defence to the
cross-claim, Mr Sutherland initially claimed that Mr Brien was invalidly
appointed because either the meeting at which
creditors resolved to appoint him
was not held within the time prescribed by s 194 of the Bankruptcy Act, or the
deed of assignment
under Pt X was not executed within the time prescribed by s
216.  However, this defence was abandoned at the hearing when the
cross-claimants
produced a minute of an order of the Federal Court of Australia
which, it was conceded, overcame the timing problem.  Therefore,
what remains
at issue in the cross-claim is, in substance, the converse of what is claimed
in the summons.
<P>

3	Mr and Mrs Roberts entered into a deed of guarantee of AIG's debts incurred
after the deed of company arrangement was executed
(debts to `post deed
creditors') and a mortgage of their properties at Gymea and Surry Hills in
favour of Mr Sutherland as administrator
to secure their obligation under the
deed of guarantee.  The amounts in Mr Sutherland's trust account are the
remaining proceeds
of  sale of the Surry Hills property and the Office of State
Revenue and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation are the only remaining
post
deed creditors.  Some post deed creditors have already been paid out and the
defendants do not seek in these proceedings to
recover those payments.
Essentially, Mr Sutherland wants to complete the administration of AIG by
paying the remaining post deed
creditors from a fund which results from
realising a security given by Mr and Mrs Roberts, and the defendants want to
divert that
fund for the benefit of the personal creditors of Mr and Mrs
Roberts.
<P>

4	Given that the question of timing has been resolved, the only issue for me to
determine is whether the deed of guarantee and mortgage
executed by Mr and Mrs
Roberts, amended by their subsequent consents which increased the amount of
guaranteed monies, are void as
against the defendants under s 120 of the
Bankruptcy Act.  If they are, the defendants will substantially or wholly
succeed on the
cross-claim and the summons will be dismissed; if they are not,
the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought in the summons and
the
cross-claim will fail.  The parties have agreed that whatever be the outcome of
the s 120 issue, they will invite me to order
that the costs of the plaintiffs
and the defendants be paid out of the fund held in Mr Sutherland's trust
account.
<P>

	<b>The Court's Jurisdiction</b>
<P>

5	Before proceeding further I must deal with a preliminary point concerning
this Court's jurisdiction. Section 27(1) of the Bankruptcy
Act, as amended in
1996, says:
<P>

	27(1) The Federal Court has jurisdiction in bankruptcy, and that jurisdiction
is exclusive of the jurisdiction of all courts other
than the jurisdiction of
the High Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 75</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

6	According to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> `bankruptcy', in relation to jurisdiction or proceedings,
means any jurisdiction or proceedings under or by virtue of the Bankruptcy
Act.
`Proceeding' means a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act.
<P>

7	Neither party asserts that s 27(1) deprives this Court of jurisdiction to
deal with the present proceedings.  On the contrary,
they have been anxious for
me to hear and determine the matter.  However, prior to the hearing counsel
properly drew my attention
to s 27(1) and invited me to satisfy myself on the
question of jurisdiction before the commencement of the hearing.  I did so.
<P>

8	In my opinion, s 27(1) does not have the effect of giving the Federal Court
exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine a matter
such as the present case.
Here, the proceedings arise out of claims to a fund held in a trust account.
The proceedings have been
brought for a determination of those claims and for
orders as to the payment of the fund.  Although the legal issue to be
determined
in the proceedings relates to the proper construction and
application of a section of the Bankruptcy Act, the proceedings themselves
are
not `proceedings under or by virtue of' the Bankruptcy Act.  Rather, they are
proceedings which invoke the Court's well-established
jurisdiction to determine
and declare rights to property and make orders as to its destination.
Consequently, these proceedings do
not fall within the definition of
`bankruptcy' in relation to jurisdiction or proceedings, and do not fall within
the `jurisdiction
in bankruptcy' which s 27(1) vests exclusively in the Federal
Court.  Proceedings of the present kind may be contrasted, for example,
with a
petition by a creditor for a sequestration order against the estate of a
debtor, where the Court exercises a statutory jurisdiction
conferred by s 43 of
the Bankruptcy Act.
<P>

9	My attention has been drawn to the statutory cross-vesting scheme provided
for in the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Acts
1987 (Commonwealth and
NSW). The explanatory memorandum to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/blab1996344/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill
1996</a>, the enactment of which brought s 27(1) into the Act (the `EM') said at
par 81:
<P>

	`Bankruptcy matters will still be able to be dealt with by Supreme Courts of
the States and the Northern Territory under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i> in appropriate cases.  Further, provisions which
enable trustees to take action in courts of competent jurisdiction for the
recovery
of debts from bankrupts and other persons, such as sections 139ZG,
subsections 139ZL(10) and 139ZQ(8) and subsection 161B(2), will
be unaffected,
and actions pursuant to those sections will be able to be commenced, as at
present in a magistrates court, District
or County Court or Supreme Court as
appropriate.'
<P>

10	It is unnecessary for me to resolve in these proceedings the precise
division between bankruptcy proceedings within the exclusive
jurisdiction of
the Federal Court under s 27(1) and proceedings cross-vested to State courts
under the cross-vesting legislation.
 This is because, in my view, s 27(1) does
not apply at all to the present proceedings for the reasons already given.
<P>

11	Counsel also drew my attention to a decision of David Kirby J in<b><i>
</i></b><i>A Mechtler v P &amp; E Phontos Pty Ltd</i> (unreported, Supreme
Court of New South Wales, 23 September 1998).  In that case the plaintiff had
appointed a trustee under a deed
of assignment pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> of the
Bankruptcy Act after his common law action had commenced.  The Court was
invited by motion to grant the trustee an extension
of time to make an election
under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act whether to prosecute the plaintiff's claim.
The Court's jurisdiction
to make the order was conferred by s 33 of the
Bankruptcy Act.  His Honour held that the Federal Court had exclusive
jurisdiction
to deal with such an application.  It is not clear whether his
Honour's attention was drawn to the EM but it is unnecessary for me
to decide
whether his reasoning is correct in light of the EM.  That was a different case
from the present because the Court was
there invited to exercise a statutory
jurisdiction conferred by the Bankruptcy Act, whereas here I am invited to
exercise the Court's
general jurisdiction with respect to rights to property,
having regard to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which may invalidate
rights which are asserted.
<P>

12	I therefore hold that s 27(1) of the Bankruptcy Act does not deprive this
Court of jurisdiction to hear and determine the present
proceedings.
<P>

	<b>Chronology of Events</b>
<P>

13	I have already sketched the principal events which give rise to this case
but it is necessary to put them into temporal sequence.
 That sequence is:
<P>

	(1) <i>20 May 1996</i> Mr Sutherland was appointed administrator of AIG;
<P>

	(2) <i>17 June 1996</i> the creditors of AIG resolved to enter  into a deed of
company arrangement;
<P>

	(3) <i>21 June 1996</i> the deed of company arrangement (`DCA') was
executed;
<P>

	(4) <i>18 December 1996</i> the committee of creditors of AIG resolved that Mr
and Mrs Roberts should provide a mortgage over their property at Surry Hills to
secure the debts of post deed creditors of AIG and deposit $130,000 in cash
into the company by 21 January 1997;
<P>

	(5) <i>16 January 1997</i> the deed of guarantee and a supporting mortgage
over the Gymea and Surry Hills properties were executed, securing payment of up
to
$180,000;
<P>

	(6) <i>21 January 1997</i> Mr Sutherland lodged a caveat over Mr and Mrs
Roberts' Gymea and Surry Hills land;
<P>

	(7) <i>22 January 1997</i> a further meeting of the committee of creditors of
AIG resolved that Mr Roberts should increase the guarantee and security to
$250,000
(undated consents to this increase by Mr and Mrs Roberts were later
signed);
<P>

	(8) <i>14 February 1997</i> a further meeting of the committee of creditors
resolved to terminate the DCA and place AIG into liquidation and to appoint Mr
Sutherland
as liquidator;
<P>

	(9) <i>April 1997</i> Mr Sutherland partially released the caveat to enable
the proceeds of sale of the Gymea land to be paid to the prior ranking
mortgagee;
<P>

	(10) <i>23 June 1997</i> Mr and Mrs Roberts' property at Surry Hills having
been sold, Mr Sutherland received the balance of the proceeds of sale;
<P>

	(11) <i>5 November 1997</i> Mr and Mrs Roberts signed authorities under s 188
of the Bankruptcy Act appointing Mr Brien as controlling trustee;  
<P>

	(12) <i>3 March 1998</i> the Federal Court made an order under s 188(4)
granting leave to Mr Roberts to give an authority to Mr Brien to call a meeting
of
his creditors;
<P>

	(13) <i>19 March 1998</i> Mr Roberts signed a further authority under s
188;
<P>

	(14) <i>2 April 1998</i> a meeting of Mr Roberts' creditors was held and Mr
Roberts signed a deed of assignment under Pt X of the Bankruptcy Act;
<P>

	(15) <i>[uncertain date] </i>Mr Sutherland, as liquidator of AIG, lodged a
proof of debt in Mr Roberts' Pt X administration, claiming $1,034,703 for
insolvent
trading liability;
<P>

	(16) <i>28 October 1998</i> Mrs Roberts signed another authority under s 188
appointing Mr Nicols as the controlling trustee of her estate;
<P>

	(17) <i>13 November 1998</i> Mrs Roberts' creditors resolved that she execute
a deed of assignment under Pt X and she did so.
<P>

	<b>Section 120 of the Bankruptcy Act</b>
<P>

14	The following provisions of s 120 are relevant in this case:
<P>

	(1) A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the
<b><i>transferor</i></b>) to another person (the <b><i>transferee</i></b>) is
void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if:
<P>

(a) 	the transfer took place in the period beginning 5 years before the
commencement of the bankruptcy and ending on the date of
the bankruptcy;
and
<P>

(b) 	the transferee gave no consideration for the transfer or gave
consideration of less value than the market value of the property.
<P>

	(4) The trustee must pay to the transferee an amount equal to the value of any
consideration that the transferee gave for a transfer
that is void against the
trustee.
<P>

	(7) For the purposes of this section: ...
<P>

	(b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the
owner of property that did not previously exist is
taken to have transferred
the property to the other person;  and
<P>

	(c) the <b><i>market value</i></b> of property transferred is its market value
at the time of the transfer.
<P>

15	For the purposes of s 120 Mr and Mrs Roberts, having executed deeds of
assignment under Pt X, are to be treated as having become
bankrupts:  s  31(2).
Counsel for the defendant submits that the deed of guarantee and mortgage make
transfers of property for the
purposes of s 120(1), having regard to s
120(7)(b).  I agree.  `Property' is broadly defined in s 5 and includes
personal property
such as a chose in  action.  The authorities on the meaning
of the word `property' when used in a statute were usefully reviewed
by Gummow
J in<b> </b><i>Hepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20ATR%2042" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 ATR 42</a>;
on appeal <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=22%20ATR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">22 ATR 465.</a>  By executing the deed of guarantee, Mr and Mrs Roberts
did something which resulted in Mr Sutherland becoming the owner, as
administrator
of AIG, of choses in action that did not previously exist.  By
executing the mortgage, they did something which resulted in Mr Sutherland
as
administrator becoming the owner of the bundle of choses in action and
proprietary interests which arise in a mortgage of real
property under the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> 100 (NSW).  Consequently, by virtue of s
120(7)(b), property of those various kinds was transferred to Mr Sutherland for
the purposes
of s 120(1) upon the execution of those instruments.  That
interpretation is confirmed, specifically as far as it relates to the
mortgage
and in principle as far as it relates to the choses in action, by par 84.10 of
the EM, which says:
<P>

	`Another important change is that provided for in proposed subsection 120(7),
whereby when a person does something which results
in another person becoming
the owner of property whether or not it previously existed, the person as a
result of whose actions property
came into being is taken to have transferred
the property to the person who owns it.  Thus where a person creates an
interest in
property, for example by allowing a mortgage or charge to be
created over it, the person will be taken to have transferred property,
for the
purposes of the section.  Likewise, if Frank who subsequently became a bankrupt
constructed a residence on a block of land
owned by Eugenie, Frank would be
taken to have transferred property to Eugenie.  The transfer would be void
against the trustee if
the house was constructed within 2 years before the
commencement of the bankruptcy and Eugenie had either not paid Frank, or if
Frank's
work in constructing the residence was worth $300,000, but Eugenie had
only paid him $150,000.  Another example might be a situation
where 3 years
before the commencement of her bankruptcy, Gertrude conferred a licence on
Harold to use a trademark, or an Item the
subject of a patent, where no licence
to use the Item previously existed.  Gertrude would be taken to be transferring
property to
Harold, and if this was done for less than what might be expected
to be the market value of the rights conferred by the licence,
the transfer
would be void, unless Harold could prove that Gertrude was not insolvent at the
time of giving the licence.'
<P>

16	The same reasoning applies to the consents which were subsequently executed
by Mr and Mrs Roberts, having the effect of increasing
the amount of the
guaranteed monies from $180,000 to $250,000.
<P>

17	It is clear that these transfers occurred within two years of the
commencement of bankruptcy of Mr and Mrs Roberts, an event
which happened at
the latest when they signed authorities under s 188 on 5 November 1996 and
thereby committed acts of bankruptcy
(see ss 40(1)(i) and 115(1)).  The less
stringent regime which applies under s 120(3) to transfers more than two but
within five
years before the commencement of bankruptcy is inapplicable here.
The sole remaining question raised by s 120(1) is under s 120(1)(b),
namely did
the transferee, Mr Sutherland, give no consideration for the transfers or give
consideration of less value than the market
value of the property? 
<P>

18	Section 120(1)(b) takes its present form as a result of the 1996 amendments.
The previous section applied only to a `settlement
of property', but if the
transaction was a settlement of property, it was necessarily void against the
trustee in bankruptcy provided
that it occurred no later than two years before
the commencement of the bankruptcy. The EM explains (par 84.8) that case law in
relation
to the old s 120 had established that the term `settlement' carries a
connotation that the person who receives the property will
retain it at least
for some foreseeable time.  The word `transfer' as defined in s 120(7) is
evidently intended to overcome that
limitation in the old law, though it goes
rather further than that, especially in view of s 120(7)(b).  
<P>

19	As to the question of market value, s 120(7)(c) is not especially helpful
but the EM says this:
<P>

	`84.13 The consideration given by a person for the transfer of property must
be an amount which is equal to at least the market
value of the property at the
time of the transfer (see proposed paragraph 120(7)(c)).  This requirement is
intended to overcome the
decision of the High Court in <i>Barton v Official
Receiver </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 75</a> that a person who claims to be a purchaser of
the property need not show that he or she has given fully adequate
consideration for
the transfer, but nevertheless must have given real and
substantial consideration, and not consideration which is merely nominal,
trivial or colourable.  The expression `market value' is intended to refer to
the value of the property concerned if it were disposed
of to an unrelated
purchaser bidding in a market on an ordinary commercial basis for property of
the kind disposed of, without any
sort of discount or incentive for purchase
being offered.  The expression is not intended to include a situation where the
property
was being disposed of at a `fire sale', at discounted prices because
of some immediate need on the part of the owner to liquidate
his or her assets.
Of course, there may be differing opinions as to the precise market value of
some property, for example house
properties, where valuers or real estate
agents may give kerbside valuations which spread over a range of monetary
values.  However,
if the property was transferred for an amount less than the
lowest amount in the range, the transfer would be a transfer at undervalue,
for
the purposes of the section.
<P>

	84.14 Forbearance to sue has always been regarded at law as good
consideration.  Such forbearance will, under the Act as proposed
to be amended
by the Bill, have to be looked at in the light of the likely value of the chose
in action.  If for example Arthur had
refrained from taking an action against
Beatrice, a bankrupt, where Arthur was likely on ordinary principles to recover
damages of
$100,000, in return for Beatrice transferring a property valued at
$200,000 to Arthur, that would be a transaction at undervalue
for the purpose
of the section.  In circumstances such as this, it may be relevant to consider
the likely costs Beatrice would incur
in unsuccessfully defending an action
brought by Arthur in working out whether the transfer was for market value.'
<P>

20	It seems to me obvious that in applying these provisions to the present
circumstances, the Court's task is two-fold:  first,
to identify as precisely
as one can, the consideration (if any) which was in fact given by Mr Sutherland
for the transfers constituted
by the deed of guarantee, the mortgage and the
subsequent consents to increases;  and secondly, if consideration was given, to
determine
whether the value of the consideration at the time of the transfers
(16 January and late January1997) was less than the market value
of the
property transferred.  I turn to the first of those tasks.
<P>

	<b>What consideration, if any, did Mr Sutherland give for the Deed of
Guarantee, Mortgage and Consents? </b>
<P>

21	Section 120(1)(b) requires the Court to identify the consideration actually
given by the transferee, not consideration which
might have been given but was
not in fact given.  The first port of call in a voyage to identify the
consideration for the transactions
of 16 January 1997 and the subsequent
consents to increase the amount of guaranteed monies is the documents
themselves.  
<P>

22	The mortgage is singularly unhelpful.  It is an `all monies' security in
printed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a> form with an associated long memorandum containing
terms and conditions which were capable of applying to a broad range of
transactions.
 `Secured Money' is defined in clause 1.1.1 of the memorandum to
mean (broadly speaking) any money which the borrower is actually
or
contingently liable to pay the mortgagee.  There is no recital or other clause
identifying any specific consideration for the
mortgage.
<P>

23	The parties to the deed of guarantee are AIG, Mr and Mrs Roberts and Mr
Sutherland.  The subject matter is almost exclusively
the obligations of the
guarantors.  The document contains the following recitals:
<P>

	`A. Sutherland is the deed administrator of AIG under a deed of company
arrangement executed on 21 June 1996.
<P>

	B. AIG continues to trade and incur debts.  As deed administrator Sutherland
wishes to ensure that the claims of creditors of AIG
with claims which do not
fall within the Deed of Company Arrangement will be paid by AIG.  AIG has
agreed to pay to Sutherland (as
agent for AIG's creditors with claims for debts
incurred on and from 22 June 1996) debts incurred by AIG after 21 June 1996 and
the
Guarantors have agreed to guarantee AIG's obligations to Sutherland on the
terms and conditions set out below.'
<P>

24	It is evident that the recitals do not expressly identify any consideration,
but recital B is consistent with the view that the
consideration supplied for
the guarantor's covenant is Mr Sutherland's forbearance, or promise to
forebear, on behalf of the creditors,
from immediately taking steps to
terminate the DCA and place the company in liquidation.
<P>

25	In view of the lack of any specific provision about consideration in the
documents (apart from the fact that the seal imports
consideration), I must
turn to the surrounding evidence.  In circumstances such as the present,
extrinsic evidence is admissible
to determine the real consideration for a
covenantor's promise:  <i>Cross On Evidence</i> (Fifth Australian Edition,
1996, by JD Heydon), para [39180].
<P>

26	In the present case the principal evidence is found in the minutes of the
meetings of the creditors of AIG held on 18 December
1996, 22 January 1997 and
14 February 1997.  The second meeting was after the execution of the initial
documents but before the increase
in the guaranteed monies.  The third meeting
was after the transactions.  Evidence about the second and third meetings is
admissible
to prove the common intention which the parties held at the earlier
time of the initial transaction: <b> </b><i>Spunwell Pty Ltd v  BAB Pty
Ltd</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2036%20NSWLR%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 36 NSWLR 290.</a>
<P>

27	The meeting of creditors held on 18 December 1996 was attended by Mr Roberts
and the other director of AIG, Mr Jeff Nield.  It
was chaired by Mr Sutherland
who reported that the company made a loss of $150,000 during the period from 1
July to 31 October 1996
whilst operating under the  DCA.  Mr Roberts `had put
approximately $60,000 cash into the company within the last 10 days for the
purpose of reducing post deed creditors'.  But, said Mr Sutherland, he would
have to recommend that the company cease trading immediately
unless there were
a capital injection to cover anticipated losses over January and February 1997.
However, if sufficient funding
in the order of at least $130,000 was
forthcoming then he would support the company's continued operation.
<P>

28	It is evident from those minutes that Mr Roberts felt personally responsible
for the company's situation, but was optimistic
about its future.  He told the
meeting that the funds which he had recently injected into the company had
depleted his resources
but he would approach his mortgagee to increase the
borrowing on the Gymea and Surry Hills properties (which were owned by his wife
and him).  There was discussion as to whether this would be feasible, during
which Mr Sutherland reiterated that he would close the
company down unless it
obtained cash or extended credit terms, and committee members expressed concern
that they had extended their
support when the company went into administration
and were not willing to be `bitten' again.  Mr Sutherland suggested a mortgage
could be granted in favour of post deed creditors provided an independent
valuation confirmed Mr Roberts' estimate of the value of
the properties.
<P>

29	The meeting then resolved, inter alia, that:
<P>

	`1. Harley and Deirdre Roberts provide security as soon as possible by way of
a second or third mortgage over the property at 67
Fitzroy Street, Surry Hills
and 6 Nowra Place, Gymea Bay to secure the position of post deed creditors and
to allow continued trading.
<P>

2. 	Provided security by way of mortgage is given the company would be allowed
to continue trading until 21 January 1997.
<P>

3. 	The directors would obtain at least $130,000 cash to inject into the
company by 21 January 1996 by raising the majority of funds
from the property
at 67 Fitzroy Street, Surry Hills and at 6 Nowra Place, Gymea Bay.
<P>

4. 	Once the directors have injected at least $130,000 cash into the company
then the mortgage will be released.
<P>

5. 	If funds of at least $130,000 are not forthcoming by 21 January 1996, then
the Deed Administrator will close the company down
and terminate all employees
on that day.
<P>

6. 	If funds are not forthcoming then the mortgage will be enforced for the
benefit of post deed creditors.'
<P>

30	The meeting of the committee of creditors held on 22 January 1997 was also
chaired by Mr Sutherland and attended by Mr Roberts
and Mr Nield.  Mr
Sutherland told the meeting that Mr and Mrs Roberts had provided a second
mortgage over the Gymea and Surry Hills
properties as arranged, but a cash
injection of at least $130,000 had not been forthcoming by 21 January 1997.  He
said that the
company would run out of cash within three to four weeks and the
first mortgagee would not lend more money to Mr and Mrs Roberts.
 Mr Roberts
said the two properties would be sold and he was negotiating for bridging
finance.  Several times he said it would be
a disaster if the company was
closed down.  He was, he said, `hell bent on survival' and would do everything
in his power to keep
the company going.  In contrast, his fellow director, Mr
Nield, said he had no money to put into the company and if the committee
wanted
to close the business down, then so be it.  The view was expressed that the
company was surviving only by not paying tax.
 Mr Roberts asked for two more
weeks to obtain funding.  The meeting resolved, in effect, to give Mr Roberts a
last chance to inject
cash into the company by 31 January 1997 provided Mr and
Mrs Roberts raised the amount of the guarantee and mortgage from $180,000
to
$250,000.
<P>

31	The meeting of creditors of 14 February 1997 was chaired by Mr Sutherland
and attended by Mr Nield but not Mr Roberts.  Mr Sutherland
reported that a
cash injection of $130,000 had not been received by 31 January 1997 and
consequently he had taken control of the
company under the DCA.  The meeting
resolved to terminate the DCA and wind the company up.
<P>

32	The question is, what was the consideration actually given by Mr Sutherland
on behalf of the post deed creditors for the execution
by Mr and Mrs Roberts of
the deed of guarantee and mortgage on 16 January 1997 and for their subsequent
consents to increase the
amount guaranteed from $180,000 to $250,000, given
later in January 1997?  That question must be answered as a question of fact
and
that is why I have set out the evidence in such detail.  The question is to
be assessed at the times of the `transfers' to which
s 120 refers, which (as I
have explained) is the time when the various transactions were entered into
rather than the time of payment
of the proceeds of sale of the Surry Hills
property pursuant to those transactions.
<P>

33	The plaintiffs submit that the consideration for entering into the deed of
guarantee and mortgage was the continuation of the
DCA and minimisation of
potential claims against Mr Roberts as a director for breach of director's
duties and insolvent trading.
 Mr Sutherland's evidence is that, if he could
not procure guarantees from Mr and Mrs Roberts, secured by mortgage, to support
AIG's
post deed trading indebtedness, he would have convened a meeting of
creditors with a view to passing resolutions which would put
AIG into
liquidation.  Then as liquidator he would have been likely to institute
proceedings against Mr Roberts as a director for
insolvent trading and
potentially for breach of duty funded by the creditors or by insurance.  If he
obtained the judgment against
Mr Roberts he would have made Mr Roberts bankrupt
and then the property jointly owned by him and Mrs Roberts would have vested in
his trustee in bankruptcy, who would have sought the appointment of trustees
for sale.  Eventually that process would have deprived
Mrs Roberts of her
rights to the properties, although she would have been entitled to her share of
the net proceeds of sale of the
properties.  Thus, according to Mr Sutherland,
the consideration given to Mrs Roberts was that continuation of the DCA made it
possible
that she would be able to preserve her interests in the properties
jointly owned by her and her husband.
<P>

34	In my opinion the plaintiffs' contentions about the consideration for the
deed of guarantee, the mortgage and the consents are
not wholly supported by
the evidence.  The minutes of the meeting of 18 December 1996 show that Mr
Roberts and Mr Sutherland, as
administrator on behalf of the post deed
creditors, made a bargain under which Mr Sutherland allowed AIG to continue
trading until
21 January 1997.  In my opinion Mr Sutherland impliedly promised
by that bargain that prior to 21 January 1997 he would not exercise
his powers
as administrator to take any step towards causing AIG to cease trading, such as
reclaiming control of management or convening
a meeting of creditors to
terminate the DCA and cause AIG to be wound up.  
<P>

35	However, the evidence does not support the contention that a promise not to
take proceedings against Mr Roberts for insolvent
trading or breach of duty, or
forbearance from taking such proceedings, was any part of the actual
consideration given by Mr Sutherland
at that time.  The minutes of the meeting
of 18 December 1996 make no mention of any such proceedings.  The creditors'
decision was
to allow AIG to continue trading under the DCA until 21 January
1997.  The question of suing for insolvent trading would not arise
unless the
conditions set out in the creditors' resolution were not met and they then
decided to place the company in liquidation,
since an administrator has no
standing to take such proceedings.  It is true that the decision of 18 December
1996 gave Mr Roberts
a reprieve from any potential proceedings on that ground,
but that was merely a consequence of the bargain, rather than part of the
consideration actually supplied by Mr Sutherland.
<P>

36	Although the evidence is skimpy, I find that the bargain made on 18 December
1996 was made by Mr Roberts on behalf of Mrs Roberts
as well as on his own
behalf.  It is most unlikely that she was unaware of the difficulties of AIG
and her husband.  I infer from
the minutes that he was desperate to secure time
to find further funds for the company and he must surely have conveyed that
feeling
and at least the broad shape of his proposals to her.  She signed the
documents after a solicitor explained their effect to her.
 In her statement of
affairs made under the Bankruptcy Act on 12 October 1998, she said that the
cause of her insolvency was `obeying
the request to sign everything put in
front of me' and she added, `I had nothing to do with anything in the business
except signing
the forms'.  Far from implying that she gave no authority to her
husband to make on her behalf a bargain such as was made on 18 December
1996,
these statements suggest to me in their context that she left her affairs to
him and he had her authority to bind her to the
arrangement he made with the
company's creditors.  It follows that the consideration given for her execution
of the deed of guarantee,
the mortgage and the consent was given jointly to her
and her husband.  That consideration was Mr Sutherland's promise to allow AIG
to continue trading until 21 January 1997.
<P>

37	In my opinion the minutes of the meeting of 22 January 1997 imply that a
supplementary bargain was made by Mr Roberts on behalf
of his wife and himself
with Mr Sutherland as administrator on behalf of the post deed creditors,
whereby Mr Sutherland promised
not to exercise any powers as administrator
towards causing AIG to cease trading until 31 January 1997 if certain
conditions, including
an increase in the guaranteed amount to $250,000, were
met.  The minutes do not refer to the possibility of action against Mr Roberts
for insolvent trading and I find that Mr Sutherland made no promise about any
such proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The market value of the property and the value of the consideration</b>
<P>

38	In my opinion, the market value of the property transferred by the deed of
guarantee and the mortgage was initially approximately
$180,000 and became
approximately $250,000.  This is because the guarantors' obligations were
secured over property which, on the
evidence, had a total realisable value,
after discharging a prior ranking security, in excess of the maximum amount
secured, which
was initially $180,000 and was increased to $250,000.  It may be
necessary to deduct some costs of recovery to the extent that any
such costs
may not have been covered by the security, and to apply a discount for the time
value of money given that the  security
was not immediately realised.  Subject
to such relatively minor adjustments, however, in my opinion an unrelated
purchaser bidding
in a market on an ordinary commercial basis for the right
acquired by Mr Sutherland under the deed of guarantee, the mortgage and
the
consents, would have paid in the vicinity of $180,000 before the increase and
$250,000 after the increase.
<P>

39	What is the value of the consideration actually given by Mr Sutherland for
these rights?  In my opinion the value of the consideration
at the time it was
given was less than the market value of the property acquired by Mr Sutherland.
In my opinion, on balance, the
value was merely nominal.
<P>

40	I must compare the market value of the property with the `value' - not
necessarily, one notes, the market value - of the consideration
given by Mr
Sutherland.  It is plain that the value of the consideration must be assessed
on an objective basis not dependent on
any special value which the transferor
may have subjectively placed on the consideration.  This is an important point
in the present
case because the evidence suggests that Mr Roberts had a totally
unrealistic sense of optimism about the future of the company and
therefore
placed an unrealistically high value on securing a short extension of time.
The EM indicates that the present wording of
s 120(1) is intended to overcome
the decision in<b> </b><i>Barton v  Official Receiver</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 75</a>,
that a person who claims to be a purchaser of property need not show that he or
she has given fully adequate consideration for the
transfer as long as the
consideration is real and substantial.  Under the new s 120 the Court is
required to make an assessment of
the objective value of the consideration if
it can, on the basis of such evidence as is available.
<P>

41	It seems to me that if one puts aside the hopes, expectations and
commitments of Mr Roberts about the future of AIG, all one
has by way of
consideration are the two promises to forebear from taking various steps for
two very short periods of time which can
have had very little, if any, value at
all, given that after the expiration of that extended time those very steps
were promptly
taken.  The value of the promises is severely affected by the
conditions upon which they were given, especially the conditions requiring
a
cash injection of $130,000 and the meeting of corporate budgets.  Looking at
the matter otherwise than through the eyes of Mr Roberts,
the arrangement which
led to the execution of the deed of guarantee and mortgage and the subsequent
increase of the secured amount
were very one sided.  Only someone who shared Mr
Roberts' enormous optimism, quite unfounded as it happened, could even begin to
contemplate such a transaction.  Mr and Mrs Roberts gave a great deal to secure
very little.  This is the kind of `under-valued transaction'
from which the
Bankruptcy Act seeks to protect the bankrupt's creditors.
<P>

42	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that I should infer that the value of
the consideration was equivalent to the value of the
property transferred.  He
relied on<b> </b><i>AAT Case 8493</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AATA/1993/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] AATA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2025%20ATR%201027" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 25 ATR 1027.</a>  In that case it was
necessary to calculate the amount of a capital loss alleged to have arisen from
an agreement, by which (to simplify)
a party was relieved from paying $40,000
to the taxpayer, which had been part of the purchase price for property, in
consideration
of its promise not to sue the taxpayer for breach of contract.
Section 160ZD(1) stated that the consideration in respect of disposal
of an
asset was, relevantly, the market value of the property received by the
taxpayer.  The task of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal
was therefore to
determine the market value of the consideration for the taxpayer's $40,000 loss
- in this case the market value
of the injured party's promise not to sue.  Dr
Gerber held that the market value of the consideration was the value which the
parties
put on it, namely $40,000, given that there had undoubtedly been a
breach of contract for which damages would probably have been
awarded with
costs if the breach had been litigated rather than settled.
<P>

43	Putting aside the obvious differences in the statutory wording and statutory
context of the Income Assessment Act and the Bankruptcy
Act, the case before Dr
Gerber is manifestly distinguishable from the case before me.  Here there is no
evidence that Mr and Mrs
Roberts would have been in any different position
after the period of forbearance expired, were it not for the bargain they made.
In fact, the correct inference is that if they had not made the bargain, AIG
would have gone into liquidation a little earlier, but
by mid February 1997 it
would have been in liquidation in any case.  In the tax case the bargain gave
the taxpayer something it would
not otherwise have received, namely immunity
from litigation which would probably have led to a verdict against it for
damages and
costs.
<P>

44	I therefore conclude on the evidence before me that the consideration given
by Mr Sutherland for the property transferred by
the deed of guarantee and
mortgage, as increased, was of nominal or no value except in the subjective
assessment of Mr Roberts, and
therefore the consideration had nominal or no
value for the purposes of s 120(1)(b).
<P>

	<b>Conclusions and Orders</b>
<P>

45	Consequently the plaintiffs have failed on the summons and the defendants as
cross-claimants have succeeded on the cross-claim.
 I propose to make the
following orders:
<P>

	1.  Declare that the transfers of property by Harley Warren Roberts and
Deirdre Ruth Roberts to the first plaintiff as administrator
of Australian
Imaging Group Pty Ltd (`AIG') on behalf of certain creditors of AIG by deed of
guarantee and mortgage each dated 16
January 1997, and by their respective
consents given in January 1997 to increase the amount of money guaranteed and
secured by those
instruments from $180,000 to $250,000, are each void against
the defendants and each of them under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s120.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 120(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>
(Commonwealth).
<P>

	2.  Declare that the defendants have no obligation to pay any amount to the
plaintiffs under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s120.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 120(4)</a> of that Act in respect of those transfers of
property.
<P>

	3.  Declare that the amount of $149,148 held in the Jirsch Sutherland Trust
Account in respect of those transfers of  property,
together with any interest
earned on that amount, is payable to the first and second defendants.
<P>

4. 	Direct that the first plaintiff pay the sum of $149,148 plus any such
interest to the first and second defendants in such portions
as they may
together direct in writing, after deducting and paying to the parties their
respective reasonable costs of these proceedings
(including the
cross-claim).
<P>

	5. Grant liberty to either party to apply on 48 hours' notice with respect to
determination of the amount of reasonable costs referred
to in order 4.
