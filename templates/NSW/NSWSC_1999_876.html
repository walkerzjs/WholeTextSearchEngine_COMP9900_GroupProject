GREG JAMES, J.
<P>

NEWCASTLE:  FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. TROY CLAYTON DAVIS</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  On 1 July 1999, the prisoner, Troy Clayton Davis,
pleaded guilty to one count of murder before his Honour Justice
Graham Barr.
He was convicted of that count and remanded in custody.
<P>

2  	Before me on 19 August 1999 the prisoner confirmed that plea, and
proceedings on sentence were then held in Sydney, those proceedings
continuing
on Monday 23 August 1999 at Newcastle.  I have regard to that plea and the
circumstances of it as I will later detail,
and have, in accord with s.439 of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, reduced the sentence accordingly.
<P>

3  	The prisoner was charged as a principal in the first degree that
on or about 12 November 1998 at Beechwood in the State of New
South Wales he
did murder Robert Christopher Spradbrow.
<P>

4  	The shooting of the deceased was committed in circumstances such
as to show that the crime was both vicious and cowardly.  I
will refer to those
circumstances later in these remarks.
<P>

5  	It was common ground in these proceedings that the prisoner had
been procured to commit the crime by his elder half-brother,
Dean Richard
Lulham.
<P>

6  	Subsequent to the conclusion of the proceedings and before I came
to pass sentence on the prisoner, Dean Lulham was arraigned
before me at
Newcastle on 24 August 1999 and pleaded guilty to murder.  This was no doubt in
consequence, at least partly, of the
prisoner having given an undertaking,
Exhibit E, to give evidence against his brother and Bradley John Moran in
respect of offences
arising out of the fatal shooting of Robert Christopher
Spradbrow at Beechwood on 12 November 1998, and having given evidence before
me
on these proceedings of his willingness to comply with that undertaking and
give evidence against his brother.
<P>

7  	The proceedings in respect of the sentencing of Dean Lulham are
still to be heard, but it is intended that the prisoner will
give evidence at
those proceedings and will give evidence in accordance with his undertaking.
<P>

8  	I am cognisant firstly of the prisoner's plea and secondly of his
co-operation.
<P>

9  	I will turn in due course to the detailed circumstances
surrounding the prisoner's admission of his involvement in the offence,
his
cooperation with the police, and his plea of guilty which came about, it is
conceded by the Crown, at the earliest possible occasion
after the prisoner was
afforded legal aid and legal advice and the specific application of the
criteria in s.442B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.  
<P>

10  	In respect of the plea of guilty, I have afforded some reduction
on that account, even though it would seem that in the small
town of Beechwood,
and in the light of the evidence to which I will refer, it was highly likely
that the prisoner would have been
apprehended and brought to trial upon a very
strong Crown case.  I accept that the prisoner almost immediately expressed
contrition
and was remorseful.
<P>

11  	In respect of the matters referred to in s.442B, it is apparent
that there should be a more substantial reduction because of
the detail and
reliability of the prisoner's cooperation, of which I was informed in evidence
by Detective Lysaught, and because
the effect of that cooperation, it appears,
has been to induce pleas of guilty from Moran and Lulham.  The detail and
truthfulness
of the evidence of the prisoner is confirmed by those pleas.
<P>

12  	Further, I am satisfied that the prisoner truthfully described
circumstances in which he was, whether for proper cause or not,
at the least
apprehensive and resentful of the deceased.  His evidence and the other
evidence persuades me that his brother also
was apprehensive and resentful of
the deceased.
<P>

13  	The prisoner's family, comprising his mother, Mrs. Ernice Davis,
and his elder step-brother, Dean Lulham, resided in the small
community of
Beechwood west of Wauchope on the mid-north coast.  For some time both Lulham
and the prisoner had cherished grievances
against the deceased, who was another
resident of that community.  
<P>

14  	The brother, Dean Lulham, was some 10 years older than the
prisoner, and the relationship was such that he had the ability
to exercise
considerable influence over the prisoner.
<P>

15  	It was asserted in evidence, and had been asserted before the
offence to others by the prisoner, that Spradbrow had threatened
him with gross
sexual abuse, in consequence of an apparent belief by Spradbrow that the
prisoner had pushed Spradbrow's car into
the river, unless the prisoner paid
Spradbrow some $5,000, and had made a threatening gesture at him.  The prisoner
also asserted
that Spradbrow had deliberately acted provocatively to him by
offensive conduct with former girlfriends of the prisoner for whom
the prisoner
had cherished and still cherishes great respect.
<P>

16  	In addition to the other matters, the prisoner gave evidence,
and it was corroborated by other evidence, that during a time
at which he was
severely depressed following the break up of a relationship, he had camped on
Kooree Island and had surprised the
deceased, who had taken his camp and tent
and thrown it in the back of a motor vehicle, heaping it under rocks.  He said,
and it
does not appear disputed, that his apprehension in relation to the
deceased included some degree of physical fear of the deceased.
 He also
referred to incidents where the deceased's conduct had the prisoner evicted
from the caravan park in which he lived.
<P>

17  	In the prisoner's belief, there was plainly a substantial basis
for him to resent and fear the deceased.
<P>

18  	I summarise the facts of the offence from the agreed facts as
supplemented by the evidence, particularly that of the prisoner
and as appears
in the statement of Miss Battle and in the prisoner's interviews with
police.
<P>

19  	On the afternoon of Thursday 12 November 1998 the prisoner and
Dean Lulham were at Kooree Island, which is in the Hastings
River on the
outskirts of Beechwood.  They had both been consuming alcohol.  Originally,
they had shared half a dozen stubbies of
beer and two cans of bourbon.
<P>

20  	While they were there, the victim and his girlfriend arrived and
went to an area of the riverbank away from the prisoner and
his brother.  The
prisoner and his brother discussed their prior involvements with the victim,
and Dean Lulham suggested that the
prisoner should shoot the victim.  Lulham
then left Kooree Island and travelled to a nearby dairy farm where he worked on
a casual
basis, and obtained an old .22 calibre rifle and ammunition, returning
to Kooree Island where further discussions took place in relation
to shooting
the victim.
<P>

21  	At the time at which the victim arrived at Kooree Island, there
was also present with the brothers Miss Rebecca Battle and
her boyfriend Robert
Davis.  Miss Battle noted the brothers' drinking, the arrival of the victim,
and recalled the prisoner telling
her that he had caught the victim taking his
tent and putting it in the back of his car under river rocks, and that the
victim had
accused him of pushing his car into the river and threatened him
with gross sexual abuse.  She noted that Dean Lulham had left and
had been gone
for some time.  Whilst he was away, the prisoner was hiding behind trees,
saying that he did not want the victim to
see him.
<P>

22  	After Dean Lulham returned, he enquired as to whether the victim
was still present, and the prisoner said that he had just
gone off into the
bushes.  They consumed more beer and Lulham produced an old-looking rifle,
saying, "I'm gonna give him a warning
shot".  A shot was then fired off over
the river.  Miss Battle became frightened.  Lulham started to talk to the
prisoner, patting
him on the arm and saying, "This is it, brother boy, I think
this is gonna be it".  Miss Battle said, "What are you talking about,
what's
going on?"  Lulham said, "We're gonna kill him".  The prisoner kept carrying on
about the threat concerning the car and the
tent and then said, "We've got to
kill him", saying to Miss Battle, "You'd better not tell anyone".
<P>

23  	Lulham went over to the victim and his girlfriend and talked to
them for some time, during which time the prisoner said to
Miss Battle, "Dean
and I have had a heart to heart and we've decided to kill Porky" (ie. Robert
Spradbrow).  When Lulham returned,
he said that the victim had been unwilling
to fight him, and at this point Miss Battle and her boyfriend determined to
leave.  Lulham
invited them to come to his home later for some drinks.  She and
her boyfriend then left.  She says that she had thought they were
not really
going to do anything, as they were "all talk".  She and he boyfriend went and
had dinner at her house and then went to
the pub and then to Dean Lulham's
house, arriving there at about 8.30 pm.  They drank for some time at that
house.
<P>

24  	The two brothers left the island and went home, where they
continued drinking.  They were joined by Bradley Moran.  Discussions
continued
between the brothers as to the victim Spradbrow and what he had done to the
prisoner in the past.
<P>

25  	In due course, the prisoner told the police that his brother
manipulated his mind:  "He knew what buttons to push";  "He knew
how to fire me
up and how to use my anger towards Chris".  The prisoner said his brother
referred to an altercation between Lulham
and the deceased over $500, and if
that is what he could expect in respect of such a small sum, what could the
prisoner expect if
the victim considered him responsible for a $5,000 debt.
<P>

26  	The brothers and Moran returned to the island where the victim
and his girlfriend were asleep upon a mattress.  At Lulham's
insistence, the
prisoner walked to where the victim and the girlfriend were sleeping, with the
loaded rifle.  He was unable at this
stage to shoot the victim, and returned,
trying to talk his brother out of it.  After renewed importuning by his
brother, who had
turned on the lights of their vehicle so the prisoner could
see, he returned to where the victim was still asleep, put the rifle
very close
to his head, and pulled the trigger.  He and Lulham then drove away from the
scene, throwing the rifle into a gully near
the Beechwood Cemetery.  They then
went home.
<P>

27  	When at home, the prisoner became concerned that the rifle would
be found, and at 4.00 am woke his mother.  With Moran, he
attempted to utilise
his mother's vehicle, pushing it down the driveway.  She questioned both men,
and although he told his mother
what he had done, she did not initially believe
him.  In order to avoid them driving drunk, she drove them on a mission which
it
turned out was to move the murder weapon to secrete it in another
location.
<P>

28  	The prisoner was arrested in the early hours of Saturday 14
November 1998.  During the time subsequent to his return to his
mother's home
and his arrest, the prisoner had expressed his contrition to his mother, who
had urged him to turn himself in.
<P>

29  	Following his arrest he was taken to the Port Macquarie Police
Station, where he participated in an electronically recorded
interview in which
he made extensive and detailed admissions.  He made reference to the incidents
between himself and the victim
that I have referred to above, but in addition,
he referred to other occasions in which he asserted the victim had acted
towards
the prisoner's female companions in a way designed, he believed, to be
offensive both to them and to him.  Subsequently, in the presence
of his
counsel, he was interviewed on 17 June 1999, particularly as to the involvement
of his brother, and again made detailed admissions.
 It was as a consequence of
that interview that the undertaking to which I have referred was obtained from
him.
<P>

30  	Evidence was given before me by the prisoner confirming the
detail in the electronically recorded interviews.  Both oral and
written
evidence was also given before me by Detective Senior Constable Lysaught, the
investigator, who confirmed that:-
<P>

"The prisoner made full and frank admissions ... in relation to his involvement
in the murder of Spradbrow.  He also supplied information
in relation to the
involvement of his half-brother, Dean Richard Lulham.  He has also indicated he
is prepared to give that evidence
at the trial of Lulham which is to commence
at the Supreme Court Newcastle on 23 August 1999   With the additional
information supplied
by the prisoner and his willingness to give evidence on
behalf of the Crown, this will strengthen the case against Lulham."
<P>

31  	Superintendent Cranna gave evidence in an affidavit sworn 17
August 1999 that he had conducted the appropriate enquiries to
ascertain that
the content of the evidence of Detective Senior Constable Lysaught was true,
accurate and that the letter containing
that evidence was authentic.
<P>

32  	Detective Lysaught gave evidence that the prisoner had been in
custody since 14 November 1998, that his admissions were immediate
upon his
arrest and at the station, and prior to entering into the electronically
recorded interview in which he confirmed those
admissions.  Further, that he
participated in showing the police the location of the killing at Kooree Island
and the various locations
of the weapon as confirmed on video, Exhibit G.  
<P>

33  	He gave evidence that in his opinion the evidence was complete,
truthful and reliable, offered for no benefit other than the
benefit of the
reduced sentence under s.442B, and that the prisoner was liable to suffer a
harsher custodial regime should it become
known within the gaol community, as
it inevitably would, that he had given evidence, or offered to give evidence,
against his brother.
<P>

34  	He gave evidence that the prisoner had shown instant remorse at
the police station and had said, "I'm not going to lie to you.
 I fuckin' did
it", and that the prisoner was crying and upset during the taping of the
electronically recorded interview.  He confirmed
that the prisoner's
information was valuable information and his undertaking valuable in that his
half-brother had denied involvement
and had attempted to inculpate the
prisoner.
<P>

35  	During his evidence in these proceedings, the prisoner produced
to the authorities a signed confession sent to him whilst he
was in gaol by his
brother.  It is valuable, although on the Crown case, only partly true.  It is
in that sense of some limited assistance
to the prosecution.
<P>

36  	It was no doubt as a consequence of the prisoner's plea,
cooperation and evidence that Bradley Moran pleaded guilty to concealing
a
serious offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s316.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.316</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a><b> </b>, and gave a similar
undertaking to that given by the prisoner, and as I have said, Dean Lulham has
now pleaded guilty to murder on
the basis of being an accessory before the
fact.
<P>

37  	However, in considering the prisoner's version of events, it is
necessary for me to remind myself that neither the deceased
nor Mr. Lulham are
available to give evidence in these proceedings.  Whilst I consider that the
prisoner's sentence should be reduced
substantially for his co-operation;  that
I should find in his favour contrition and remorse;  and that at the time of
the commission
of the offence he was severely affected by intoxicating liquor
and emotionally vulnerable to his brother's importuning, nonetheless
I find he
retained sufficient composure not to kill on the first occasion when he went to
the victim and to seek to talk his brother
out of the crime, albeit changing
his mind and killing.  
<P>

38  	As I have said, the killing was cowardly and vicious.  It was a
deliberate commission of the most serious of criminal offences.
 The prisoner
had sufficient composure to know well what he was doing and that the
consequences of his crime would involve for him
a lengthy prison sentence.
<P>

39  	That said, despite the reservations I might have arising from
the absence on the plea of any contrary version, it nonetheless
seems to me
that I am bound on the evidence before me to deal with the matter as it was
presented by both the Crown and the defence
as to the role of the prisoner and
his brother.  I note that the prisoner's account is supported by other
evidence, including that
of Miss Battle and Miss Wallis, the latter at least as
to Lulham's resentment and hostility towards the victim.
<P>

40  	Turning to subjective matters, the prisoner has a limited prior
record for cultivating prohibited plants, possession of equipment
to administer
a prohibited drug and possess prohibited drug for which he was fined in 1993,
but no other criminal offences.
<P>

41  	The prisoner's family broke up when he was six, and the
subsequent involvement of his mother with another man was accompanied
by
alcohol abuse and domestic violence.  The prisoner came to depend upon his
brother and his two-year-older sister.
<P>

42  	The prisoner was the subject of a closed head injury at the age
of 10, and medical records were provided to me in that regard.
 They indicated
that he had suffered some degree of injury to his left parieto-temporal region.
A neuro-psychological assessment
by Miss Jill Farrelly, clinical psychologist,
indicated test results consistent with such an injury.  Neither the discharge
summary
from Port Macquarie Hospital nor the assessment of Miss Farrelly,
however, indicated that such injuries as he may have sustained
in that accident
were implicated in the commission of this crime, nor do they appear to be of
relevance to the circumstances in which
the prisoner will serve his
sentence.
<P>

43  	Those test results and the psychiatrist's report provided by Dr.
Olav Nielssen suggest that there was no developmental disability,
psychotic
illness, major mood disorder or character disorder of relevance to the
commission of this offence.  
<P>

44  	Dr. Nielssen, while noting the significant depression after the
breakdown of a relationship with one of his girlfriends, to
which I have
earlier referred, and the effects of alcohol abuse and the prisoner's adverse
social circumstances, suggests that the
combination might be considered severe
enough to attract a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  Dr.
Nielssen is
of the following opinion:-
<P>

"A combination of perceived provocation, acute intoxication and the influence
of his older half-brother contributed to Mr. Davis
shooting Mr. Spradbrow.
Although he reported significant depressive symptoms extending for nearly a
year after the breakdown in his
relationship with Sandy he had recovered
sufficiently to be able to continue in the training scheme and did not describe
symptoms
of depression of sufficient severity to be considered to have
substantially impaired mental responsibility.  I did not elicit a history
of
pathological intoxication associated with underlying brain damage, or impaired
emotional regulation or control likely to be due
to brain damage.  In my
opinion Mr Davis is fit to enter a plea.
<P>

If the account of Mr. Davis' half-brother's involvement in the offence is
correct, and I understand the forensic evidence supported
his account, then he
should share responsibility for the death of Mr. Spradbrow.  Mr. Davis said
that he looked to his half-brother
as a father figure during his childhood and
that Dean had considerable influence over him.
<P>

Mr. Davis' prospects for rehabilitation appear to be good, as he did not
exhibit traits or report features of any form of personality
disorder, has been
employed for most of the previous 10 years, and his substance abuse disorder
appeared to be mainly in response
to the depression which followed the
breakdown of his long-term relationship.  Moreover, he does not have a
psychiatric disorder
or brain damage likely to interfere with his
rehabilitation."
<P>

45  	The certificates and references in respect of the prisoner's
attainments in custody and his personal qualities, in particular
as observed by
Miss Ayling, are such as to support Dr. Nielssen's conclusion.
<P>

46  	The Probation and Parole Service report tendered in evidence
sets out the prisoner's background and is consistent with what
information was
provided to Dr. Nielssen.  It discloses that the prisoner is now aged 25,
having been born on 19 February 1974. 
The report refers in detail to the two
relationships with girlfriends to which I have earlier made reference.  The
first of those
relationships continued for some 10 years, breaking down at the
end of 1997.  It was obviously a relationship of great intensity
and the
break-up caused the prisoner to have difficulties coping so that he turned to
both cannabis and alcohol abuse.  The break-up
of a second relationship also
adversely affected the prisoner emotionally and was the occasion for his
camping on Kooree Island to
which I have referred.
<P>

47  	The officer notes that the prisoner attributes the relationship
break-ups and subsequent events to the victim.
<P>

48  	The prisoner had limited education and has had a limited range
of employment, but has obtained a horticulture certificate and
had worked in a
Government employment programme.  His use of drugs and alcohol was noted as
intense.  Other evidence showed that
use to be so intense that his sister, who
gave evidence before me, had in fact spoken to Dean Lulham prior to the
commission of the
offence about how worried she was concerning the prisoner
drinking and living off on the island in a tent.  She said the prisoner
had
threatened suicide.  She told Dean Lulham not to let the prisoner have a gun
because he might hurt himself or someone else. 
She relied on Dean Lulham to
avoid her brother causing injury to himself or another.  He undertook to her
not to allow his brother
to come in contact with a gun.  Her evidence confirms
the prisoner's vulnerability.
<P>

49  	However, the Probation and Parole Service officer refers to the
prisoner's attitude to the offence now as follows:-
<P>

"<b>Attitude to offence - </b>the prisoner acknowledged his guilt to the
offence.  However, he appears to have difficulty in accepting full
responsibility for his
actions.  He tends to apportion blame to the urgings of
others for him to shoot the victim and the consumption of a large quantity
of
alcohol.  Whilst he has expressed remorse for his actions, the victim and the
victim's family, this appears to be counted (sic)
by feelings of self-pity and
the ruination of his life."
<P>

50  	The prisoner gave detailed evidence before me of his
circumstances and of the commission of the offence.  That evidence was
in
accord with the detailed histories given to Dr. Nielssen and the Probation and
Parole Service officer.  He gave detailed evidence
of the incidents that had
occurred between the deceased and himself involving the girlfriends, the
allegation over the car, and the
taking of the tent.
<P>

51  	I was left in no doubt that the conclusion of the Probation and
Parole Service officer as to the prisoner's attitude to the
offence had been
entirely accurate.  The prisoner referred to his state of mind at the time of
the commission of the killing.  He
said that he had left his conscience in his
brother's lap in the car, "I know the real meaning of facing your fears and
living your
nightmares".  He gave evidence that he wished to take full
responsibility for his own actions but that he did not want to be responsible
for his brother's.  In court he apologised in an emotional scene to the family
of the deceased.  He expressed the view that he had
destroyed that family and
his own too.
<P>

52  	In cross-examination, although he asserted he was in fear of the
deceased, he agreed that, even taking into account those incidents
to which I
have referred, there had never been any physical attack upon him by the
deceased, although he asserted there had been
a physical attack upon his
brother.  Again as to his state of mind at the time of the killing he said:  "I
lost it for 30 seconds
because of his" - I interpolate, meaning the brother's -
"pressure".  He agreed that he was aware at the time of the killing of its
moral wrongness.
<P>

53  	I accept that without the urging of his brother and the effects
of intoxication, the prisoner would not have committed the
crime.  I add to
those findings my further findings of the prisoner's depression and emotional
vulnerability as compounding the effects
of the intoxication and the brother's
urging.  I accept that the brother's manipulation of this prisoner in his
vulnerable circumstances
was extremely powerful.
<P>

54  	I further accept that although it was likely he would have been
arrested and prosecuted successfully on a strong Crown case,
in the events that
have transpired he has made the strength of the Crown case both against himself
and his brother.  Consequently,
I have regard to the principles in <b>The Queen
v. Ellis</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20603" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 603</a> at 604, and those to which I referred  in
<b>The Queen v. Baldacchino</b> (unreported 7 July 1998) at pp.16-17.  
<P>

55  	I have regard to the plea, the co-operation, the immediacy of
the prisoner's contrition and co-operation which are matters
of weight not only
in themselves, but also as pointing towards the prospects of rehabilitation to
which Dr. Nielssen directly and
the Probation and Parole officer less directly
have referred.  
<P>

56  	I also, however, have regard to the general principles which I
must apply referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>Regina v. Dodd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 57 A. Crim. R. 349</a> at 354 to which I again refer in <b>Baldacchino</b>
(supra).
<P>

57  	It would be in error to under-estimate the objective gravity of
this crime, and I should not because of subjective circumstances,
reduction for
plea or co-operation or otherwise, pass a sentence unreasonably
disproportionate to the serious criminality.
<P>

58  	It is submitted that the violence the prisoner showed that night
was out of character.  I accept that, as according with the
finding that I
made, that in the absence of the urging of the brother and the degree of
intoxication he had that night, he would
not have committed the crime.
However, just as the alcohol is not, in my view, a mitigating or aggravating
circumstance in the commission
of the present crime, the vulnerability to the
brother's importunings which underlay and was aggravated by the alcohol sets
the context
for that violence and the commission of the crime, but it does not
excuse what occurred.  At most the alcohol and importuning go
only some way to
offset the hours of deliberating on the prospect of killing the deceased,
leading up to what was, on any view, a
premeditated, vicious killing.
<P>

59  	The Crown submits that the appropriate range of sentence prior
to application of the s.442B criteria is for a head sentence
of some 18 to 22
years, but that the circumstances would warrant a substantial reduction by the
application of those criteria.
<P>

60  	The defence submits that the range is some 12 to 18 years
without the application of those criteria, and submits that the frailty
and
weakness of the prisoner is not to be treated as though thereby he was as
culpable as the principal moving party.
<P>

61  	Neither party has submitted that there is any particular
requirement in the present sentence for some element peculiar to the
prisoner
of personal deterrence.  There seems no issue but that he realises the enormity
of what he has done and the enormity of
the consequences for others and for
himself.
<P>

62  	There does seem a real prospect for rehabilitation, and that
process seems to me to have substantially proceeded already.
<P>

63  	I have been provided with the relevant Judicial Commission
statistics, but I find them of limited utility in a case of such
unusual
circumstances.
<P>

64  	In my view this is a case in which, absent the elements of
co-operation and assistance that I have already referred to, and
which were
underlined by the production of the brother's confession, a sentence might well
have been warranted  in excess of 20 years.
 
<P>

65  	There clearly is in the present matter, both in the youth of the
offender;  the length of the sentence he will be required
to serve;  the
possibility that it may be served,  as to some part at least, in circumstances
in which he might be confined in more
onerous conditions by reason of his
co-operation;  and in the co-operation itself and the prospect of
rehabilitation, ample evidence
of special circumstances.  However, in the
context of the length of the sentence that I intend to impose, it appears to me
that there
is no need for a variation of the statutory proportion prescribed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.5(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>, as there does not seem to me to be a need for a
longer period of supervision than the statutory proportion would require, nor
any
need for a longer period at liberty during which the prisoner's conduct in
the community should be subject to the sanction that he
be returned to custody
to serve out the balance of the sentence.
<P>

66  	Having regard, in particular, to the circumstances of the
prisoner's plea, past co-operation and future cooperation, in my
view the
appropriate sentence is a sentence of 16 years, comprising a minimum term of 12
years to date from 14 November 1998 and
to expire on 13 November 2010, and an
additional term of four years to commence on 14 November 2010 and to expire on
13 November
2014.
<P>

67  	Mr. Davis, I sentence you to penal servitude for 16 years, that
sentence to comprise a minimum term of 12 years to date from
14 November 1998
and to expire on 13 November 2010, and an additional term of four years to
commence on 14 November 2010 and to expire
on 13 November 2010.  The earliest
date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 13 November
2010.
<P>
