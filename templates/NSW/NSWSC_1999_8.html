<P>

<i>(First Defendant)</i>
<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>

<b>	Reasons For Judgment</b>
<P>

1	On 29 April 1998, Bell AJ made consent orders as to the joinder of the New
South Wales Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC) as second
defendant on a costs
neutral basis.  The first defendant (Anderson) is the Registered Native Title
Claimant on behalf of the Euahlay-i
Dixon Clan.
<P>

2	By leave granted on 27 April 1998 the plaintiff filed an Amended Summons in
Court seeking the following substantive relief:
<P>

<i>"1.	A declaration that native title, if any, that may have existed over land
the subject of Western Lands Lease No. 7951 granted under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Western Lands Act
1901</a> (NSW) ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>") was extinguished by virtue of one or more of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, or regulations or instruments made
thereunder, at any time;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the grant of Western Lands Lease No. 7951;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the terms and conditions of Westerns Land Lease No. 7951 at any
time;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the entry by the current or any previous lessee under Western Lands
Lease No. 7951 onto the subject land at any time.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	In the alternative to 1, a declaration that native title, if any, that
may have existed over land the subject of Western Lands
Lease No. 7951 is
suspended for the duration of Western Lands Lease No. 7951".</i>
<P>

3	(Orders 4 and 5 are not sought:  they relate to seeking to have withdrawn
Proceedings NC 96/26 in the National Native Title Tribunal
and to restraining
the first defendant from lodging any further claim).
<P>

4	By Notice of Motion also filed on 27 April 1998 the plaintiff seeks to have
the Amended Summons proceedings removed to the Court
of Appeal (<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act 1970</a></i>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(5)</a>;  SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 12</a> r 2).  The Motion sets out essentially
as a series of questions for determination by that Court in the event of
removal, the substance
of the declarations sought, or their determination as
separate questions of law (SCr Pot 31 r 2). 
<P>

5	Each of the defendants has filed a Notice of Motion.  That of the first
(Anderson) seeks an order that the proceedings instituted
by the plaintiff be
stayed.  The second defendant (NSWALC) seeks the following:
<P>

<i>"1.	That the proceedings be stayed or dismissed on the grounds that:</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	the Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to the subject matter
of the proceedings;</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	the court does not have power to grant the relief sought;</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	if the Court does have jurisdiction and power, it would in its
discretion decline to grant the relief sought; and</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	the commencement of the proceedings is an abuse of process of the
Court".</i>
<P>

6	The substantive issue in the plaintiff's proceedings is whether or not the
relevant lease granted under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Western Lands Act, 1901</a></i> extinguishes or
suspends native title.
<P>

7	The proceedings before me were concerned however with the parties' respective
Notices of Motion.
<P>

	<b>The Evidence </b>
<P>

8	The annexures to the affidavits sworn 28 April 1998 by the plaintiff's
solicitor, Mr Emmerig are constituted by the relevant Western
Land Lease number
7951:  a title search disclosing the plaintiff as lessee;  a
Registrar-General's Memorandum as to Reservations,
etc.;  an extract of the
Register of National Native Title Claims in respective of the first defendant;
an Amended Land Area Description
disclosing the claim to cover the land area of
the lease and the first defendant's <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act, 1993</a></i> (Cth)
Application as a person claiming to hold native title.
<P>

9	In his second affidavit, sworn 4 June 1998 (and admitted over objection
(T5.15)), Mr Emmerig deposes, on information and belief,
as to certain
statistical material with respect to;  8,494 Western Lands Division leases;
4,250 of which are Grazing Leases;  1,500
leaseholders;  the amount of land
covered by such leases being 42 per cent of this State (32.5 million hectares).
Mr Emmerig also
deposes to the role of the NSW Farmers Association played in
aid of its Western Division members following the decision of the High
Court in
<b><i>Wik Peoples v Queensland</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20187%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 187 CLR 1</a>
("<b><i>Wik</i></b><i>")</i>.
<P>

10	Mr Emmerig was cross-examined by Mr Basten Q.C. for the second defendant.
The bare statistical material was unchallenged.  The
deponent's opinion as to
the relevant lease vis-a-vis other Crown leases, whilst based on the
information given to him by a Mr Ibbotson,
a Department of Land and Water
Conservation officer, was not founded otherwise in personal knowledge.  Mr
Emmerig could not assist
the Court as to the relevant lease in relation to
timber-getting rights, withdrawal of land, disposal of leases, stock routes,
camping
and taking of water.  In the end, the witness himself was unable to
express a view as to whether the plaintiff's lease was typical
of Western
Division leases generally.
<P>

11	For the defendants the first affidavit read was that sworn on 24 April 1998
by Simon Blackshield, Senior Legal Officer of the
Native Title Unit of NSWALC.
He deposed to the NSWALC having been determined the representative
Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander
body for the whole of this State pursuant to
s 202 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act, 1993</a></i> (Cth).  On 24 July 1996 NSWALC
lodged a Native Title Determination Application which was accepted on 1
November 1996 by the National
Native Title Tribunal (NNTT).  On 12 November
1996 NSWALC gave notice pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 68</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, of its
intention to become a party, its status as a party being accepted by NNTT on 15
November 1996.  Relevant documents are annexed
to the affidavit.  Also annexed
are documents prepared by NNTT listing interested parties to the application.
The substance of this
documentary material will be referred to later.  NSWALC
intends to play an active role in the application, assisting indigenous parties
and providing factual information for the purposes of the application and to
file evidence thereon if an when the matter is referred
to the Federal Court of
Australia under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.
<P>

12	A second affidavit (sworn 28 April 1998) of Mr Blackshield deposes to NSWALC
agreeing to representation for the Kennedy and McBride
families as an
indigenous party to the native title application.  The balance of the affidavit
material is comprised of affidavits
of Sean Docker (sworn 8 June 1998) relating
to the discontinued proceedings in matter 10917 of 1998);  and Paul Toni (sworn
29 May
1998) relating to the request for and the supply of certain
particulars.
<P>

13	The affidavit of Andrew Chalk, sworn 9 June 1998, annexes correspondence
relating to written submissions and a proposed statement
of agreed facts.  As
to this last mentioned, there is a dispute as to the extent of agreement
reached.  This is significant in the
context particularly of the application
for removal to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

	<b>Submissions &amp; Issues on Stay Applications</b>
<P>

14	The original Summons was filed in this matter on 9 April 1998.  The hearing
of argument took place before me on 9 and 10 June
1998 by which time written
submissions had been delivered and filed by the parties.  During the course of
submissions reference was
of course made to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act, 1993</a></i>
(Cth).  There was passing reference in oral submissions and particular
reference in the written submissions prepared by Mr Sullivan
Q.C. for the
plaintiff, to the fact of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ntaa1998227/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Amendment Act, 1998</a></i>.  The
Amendment <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> came into effect on 30 September 1998 at which time my judgment
on the three motions was still reserved.
<P>

15	On 13 August 1998 the solicitors for the plaintiff were good enough to
inform me of the enactment of the amending legislation.
 On 4 September 1998 I
arranged a memorandum to be delivered to counsel inviting further submissions
by the parties, if so advised,
as to the effect, if any of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ntaa1998227/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Amendment Act, 1998</a>, </i>on the submissions and arguments heard by me on 9 and
10 June.
<P>

16	Supplementary submissions were filed for the second defendant (NSWALC) on 18
September 1998 which submissions were adopted by
the first defendant
(Anderson).
<P>

17	Supplementary submissions for the plaintiff were delivered on 24 September
1998.
<P>

18	On 14 October 1998 a communication from the solicitors for the plaintiff was
received in my chambers enclosing a proposed affidavit
of Mr Emmerig sworn on
that day to which was annexed an extract from Hansard relating to the debate in
the New South Wales Parliament
on 23 September 1998 in relation to the
<i>Native Title (NSW) Amendment Bill</i>.  There has been no communication from
the other parties consequent upon the delivery of the letter from the
plaintiff's solicitors
of 14 October 1998.
<P>

19	I propose to deal first with the submissions made orally and in writing on 9
and 10 June in the light of then <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a></i>.  Having done so
I will then consider the submissions as to the effect of the amending
legislation whereupon I will make my rulings
on the motions for a stay.
<P>

20	The defendants perceive the institution of these proceedings as calling upon
this Court to take steps which would deny them the
opportunity to exercise
statutory rights existing under Commonwealth legislation.
<P>

21	It is fundamental to the defendants' position that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i> provides an exclusive code in relation to the dealing with claims for
native title made under the legislation.  
<P>

22	Native title is a set or bundle of rights and interests in relation to land
which derive, not from the common law of Australia,
but from custom and
tradition of those indigenous people who historically occupied this country
before European settlement (<b><i>Mabo v Queensland</i></b> <b><i>(No.
2)</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 1</a> ("<b><i>Mabo No.2</i></b>").
<P>

23	It is submitted that where an application has been made to the Native Title
Registrar pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> the Supreme Court of
New South Wales has no jurisdiction to make orders and grant relief in relation
to that application or more
particularly the land and any native title claims
the subject of that application.
<P>

24	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> provides that native title is recognised and
protected in accordance with that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> (s 10).  Native title is not<i> "able to
be extinguished</i>" contrary to that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 11(1)).</a>  
<P>

25	Section 13 provides for applications to the Federal Court for approved
determinations of native title under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  Section13(3)
relevantly provides that an approved determination of native title is a
determination made on application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> to the Federal Court of
Australia and <i>"an order/judgment or other decision of a recognised
State/Territory body that involves a determination of Native Title in relation
to an area within the jurisdictional limits of the State or Territory" </i>(s
(13(3)(b)).
<P>

26	It is conceded by the plaintiff that there is no recognised State body as is
referred to in the sub-section.  The defendants
however, rely upon the
existence of the provisions relating to recognised State/Territory bodies as
reinforcing the "<i>exclusive</i>" nature of the scheme for determination of
native title under the Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

27	The definition in s 253 of "<i>recognised State/Territory body</i>" directs
attention to s 251(2) which provides for the criteria to be satisfied before
the Minister makes a determination as to such
a body.
<P>

28	Section 251(2) provides:
<P>

<i>(2)	In order to ensure that there is a nationally consistent approach to the
recognition and protection of native title, the Commonwealth
Minister must not
make the determination unless the Commonwealth Minister is satisfied
that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	any procedures under the law of the State or Territory for:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	approved determinations of native title by the body; and</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	determinations of compensation for acts affecting native title;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	determinations whether acts affecting native title may be done; will
be consistent with those set out in this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any procedures that will apply under the law of the State or Territory
for the registration and notification of any claims in
respect of native title
that may be made to the body will be efficient; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the body will have available to it, through its membership or otherwise,
appropriate expertise (including expertise in matters
relating to Aboriginal
peoples and Torres Strait Islanders) for performing its functions in relation
to native title; and</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the procedures of the body under the law of the State or Territory in
performing its functions in relation to native title will
be informal,
accessible and expeditious; and</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	the body will, under the law of the State or Territory, be able to
mediate matters appropriate cases; and</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	the body will have adequate resources to enable it to perform its
functions in relation to native title..."</i>
<P>

29	Thus, it is said, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> reveals the statutory scheme which is inconsistent
with the exercise by this Court of functions arising under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i> including that of determining whether or not native title exists in
relation to particular land or waters.  Further, I would take
it that reliance
is placed particularly in relation to any discretion considerations, to the
reference to a nationally consistent
approach referred to in the section.
<P>

30	As to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> - Applications:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62</a> sets out the formalities which must be
complied with for a native title application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61.</a>  The relevant
application is annexure B to Mr Blackshield's affidavit of 24 April 1998.  Upon
the application being lodged, the Registrar
is obliged to put the details of
the claim on the Register;  this is provided for in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, s 184 and
following.  Section 109, the keeping of the Register, requires, <i>inter
alia</i>, the Registrar to include details of any claim <i>"accepted</i>" by
the Registrar.
<P>

31	The Register of claims under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7</a> is not to be confused with the National
Native Title Register under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p8" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 8</a> which deals with the recording of native title
determinations.
<P>

32	As has been referred to in the evidence, the claim has been
"<i>accepted</i>" by the Registrar (see annexure C to Mr Blackshield's
affidavit, <i>supra</i>).  Notice is to be given to various persons (ss 63 and
66);  this has taken place.  The evidence before me (annexure F to Mr
Blackshield's
affidavit) discloses a total of 844 parties to the Native Title
Application, including the claimant, 16 other indigenous parties
with native
title interests and 776 holding mining interests.
<P>

33	There is a scheme pursuant to which the Tribunal is required to seek a
resolution of the application including by way of mediation.
 Failing a
successful outcome therefrom the application is lodged (s 74) with the Federal
Court.  
<P>

34	Section 81 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> provides:
<P>

<i>"The Federal Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications
lodged with it under section 74 and that jurisdiction is exclusive
of the
jurisdiction of all other courts except the High Court".</i>
<P>

35	This is the foundation for the <i>"exclusive</i>" jurisdiction.  The
determination of the Federal Court is an approved determination under s 13(3)
and is binding <i>in rem</i> (<b><i>Wik Peoples v Queensland</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/967.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 967</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2049%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 49
FCR 1)</a><i>.</i>
<P>

36	Reference was also made in the course of submissions by Mr Basten Q.C. as to
the outline of the legislation, to s 213 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> which provides that for the
purpose of any matter or proceeding before the Federal Court, it is necessary
to make a determination
of native title, that determination must be made in
accordance with the procedures in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and subject to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, the Federal
Court has jurisdiction in relation to matters arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  Section
220 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, in combination with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act, 1987</a></i>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4</a> proscribes the cross-vesting of matters from
the Federal Court.
<P>

37	It is to be noted also that by the operation of s 61 a person who holds a
"<i>non-native"</i> title interest in relation to the whole of the area in
relation to which the determination is sought, may make an application with
respect to the determination of native title.
<P>

38	Again, for completeness it was said, I was referred to what I shall describe
as the <i>"past acts</i>" validation sections, ss 14 and 15 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, and
Div. 3 dealing with <i>"future acts</i>" (as defined in s 233), and in
particular, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 24</a> which deals with what are described as "<i>unopposed
non-claimant applications"</i>.
<P>

39	This last mentioned section picks up s 67(4):  <i>"if a non-claimant
application is not taken to have been dismissed (for example, on the making of
a claimant application)"</i> (s 67(2)) it is taken to be unopposed.  The point
of this complex reference, as I understood it, was that it was open to a person
in the position of the present plaintiff to make a non-claimant application for
whatever purpose he needed in relation to the land
in which he has an interest
(for example, to upgrade or develop), and absent then any native title interest
to be taken into account,
his position would be identified and made clear.  The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> has a structure for such a purpose:  if that mechanism is engaged it is
stopped by native title claim.  Thus, it is argued that in
the present case,
where, absent a non-claimant application by the plaintiff, but in the face of a
claimant application, the plaintiff's
claim in the proceedings in this Court
run counter to the clearly envisaged scheme under the legislation.
<P>

40	The "<i>future acts</i>" regime to which I have referred as a component of
the <i>"scheme</i>" relied upon by the defendants, was considered by the High
Court in what is known as the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> Case</b> (<b><i>State
of Western v The Commonwealth; v Wororra People &amp; Ors v The State of
Western Australia</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d1995%29%20183%20CLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-1995) 183 CLR 373).</a>  The case involved a
detailed consideration of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> and its validity in a
context where Western Australia had passed legislation purporting to transform
native title into a set of statutory
rights.  Shortly stated, it was held that
that legislative attempt was invalid.  Bearing in mind the purpose of the
Court's extensive
review of the legislation, the following passage (from p 453)
is relied upon as an indication of the view being taken of the legislation
as a
code:
<P>

<i>"The first of the enacted objects of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> is `to provide for
the recognition and protection of native title' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 3(a)).</a>  This object is
achieved by a statutory declaration <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 11(1))</a> that native title `is not able to
be extinguished contrary to this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.'  The protection given to native title by
this provision removes its vulnerability to defeasance at common law by
providing a prima
facie sterilization of all acts which would otherwise defeat
native title.  By that prima facie sterilization, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11(1)</a> ensures that the
exceptions prescribed by other provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> which permit the
extinguishment or impairment of native title constitute an exclusive code.
Conformity with the code is essential
to the effective extinguishment or
impairment of native title. The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> thus governs the recognition,
protection, extinguishment and impairment of native title".</i>
<P>

41	To similar effect is a passage at 457-8 of the High Court's general survey
dealing with particularly the rights to negotiate
provisions in Div. 3 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 2</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
26</a> and following (in the context of the impairment of native title by
compulsory acquisition and mining leases).
<P>

	<i>"Subdivision B of Div.3 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> contains provisions
conferring a "right to negotiate" on the holders of native title when the
Commonwealth, a State or a Territory
proposes to create, vary or extend a right
to mine or to acquire compulsorily native title rights and interests in order
to confer
rights or interests on some person other than the acquiring
Government or to do some other act approved by the Commonwealth Minister
administering the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 26(2)).</a>  "Native title parties" are entitled to notice
(s 29), to negotiate (ss 30, 31, 32, 33) and, in the event of disagreement (s
37),
to have the question determined by an arbitral body <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 27</a> 35, 38, 39).
In addition, notice must be given to the public, the arbitral body and to any
person who seeks the doing of the particular
future act (s 29(2)(d), (e), (3)).
In these cases, the proposed future act is invalid unless (i) agreement is
reached by the negotiating
parties (s 28(1)(d)), (ii) the arbitral body
determines the proposed act may be done, with or without conditions (s
28(1)(e)), or
(iii) in the event of a determination that the act must not be
done, a Commonwealth, State or Territory Minister overrules the determination,
with or without conditions (ss 28(1)(f), 42).  If the act is done and
conditions apply, they have the force of a contract among the
negotiating
parties (ss 34, 41, 42(7)).</i>
<P>

<i>	The effect of a permissible future act on native title depends on the
nature of the act. If a Commonwealth, State or Territory law
provides for the
compulsory acquisition of native title and other interests in relation to land
or waters and for compensation in
money or a form other than money, acquisition
under the law is valid and an act done "in giving effect to the purpose of the
acquisition"
may extinguish native title <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 23(3)).</a> But the mere acquisition of
native title or the doing of any other permissible future act does not
extinguish native title; it merely
suspends native title rights and interests
so far and for so long as is necessary to allow the permissible future act to
operate
and have effect. Compensation is payable by the Commonwealth, State or
Territory as the case may be or, if the relevant statute so
provides, by the
person who has requested that the permissible future act be done <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 23(5)).</a> If
a permissible future act relates to an area over which native title has not
been claimed before a Native Title Tribunal and in
respect of which it is
claimed without objection that there is no native title (s 67), any future act
is valid and may extinguish
native title unless a competent court or tribunal
has subsequently determined that native title exists <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 24</a>, 13(3), (4), (7),
253).  If it turns out that native title rights and interests have thereby been
extinguished or impaired, the holder
is entitled to compensation.</i>
<P>

<i>	Apart from extinguishment by past acts and future acts, native title can be
extinguished by agreement between the holders of native
title and the
Commonwealth, State or Territory (as the case may be) in which the relevant
land is situated. The agreement may either
surrender the native title or
authorize a future act that will affect the holders' native title. The
consideration may consist in
a grant of freehold or some other interest in the
same or other land <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 21)".</a></i>
<P>

42	This again recognises the nature of an exclusive code provided by the
legislation and in relation to <i>"future acts</i>". 
<P>

43	It is further submitted that in circumstances where an application has been
accepted the submission of a claim to judicial determination
(as per the
Amended Summons to the Supreme Court of New South Wales in this case), amounts
to "<i>inverting</i>" the statutory order of disposing of claims, <i>a
fortiori</i> before the stage of negotiation is reached under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  The
structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, it is submitted, points to two broad
categories of applications:  opposed applications which go to the Federal Court
for judicial
determination and unopposed applications for determination by the
Tribunal.  The process of migration of a claim from the latter
to the former
cannot be subverted or should not be subverted or "<i>inverted</i>" by seeking
a judicial determination <i>dehors</i> the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and its scheme:  <b><i>North
Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation &amp; Anor v The State of Queensland &amp;
Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d1996%29%20185%20CLR%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-1996) 185 CLR 595</a>;  see Gummow J at 625).
<P>

44	It is important to note at this juncture that it is <i>not</i> the
defendants contention, for example, that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> by
reason of its reference to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court
thereby creates generally an exclusive jurisdiction.
 As I understood their
submissions, the defendants conformably with the position taken by the
plaintiff, assert that the Federal
Court has exclusive jurisdiction upon the
initiation of native title claims under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.  In that
regard there is no issue.
<P>

45	Further, it is <i>not</i> the submission of the defendants that in no
circumstances can a native title question be considered, for example, by a
State Court.
 In this regard reference is made to the decision of <b><i>Mason v
Tritton</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 572</a> where in the defence of a criminal
prosecution relating to fishing for abalone without a licence the question of
entitlement under
native title rights arose.  Indeed, the Register referred to
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s193.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 193</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>, </i>that is, the Register of
determinations to which I referred earlier, in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s193.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 193(1)(c)</a> refers to other
determinations in relation to native title in decisions of courts.  It is
acknowledged that at least by reason of
that component of the statutory
provision for the <b>d</b>etermination <b>r</b>egister, it is envisaged that
determinations will arise in other circumstances.  It is submitted, however,
that even if such "<i>other circumstances</i>" exist that does not mean that
the whole scheme of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> can be subverted by an attempt to have a court such
as the Supreme Court make a determination where the primary, and indeed only
purpose, is to ascertain whether or not native title exists.  As I understand
it, the position of the defendants is that, save for
the "<i>other
circumstances</i>" to which I have referred and as exemplified by the case of
<b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b><i>,</i> the overall scheme of the legislation
points to the substantive and procedural propriety of the valid Commonwealth
statute (its constitutionality
not here being challenged) having a particular
(and generally universal operation) to which State law must give way including
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>.  
<P>

46	Particular reliance is placed in this area generally upon the decision of
the High Court in the <b><i>North Ganalanja </i></b>case (<i>supra</i>).
<P>

47	The case provides an analysis of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> </i>and in
particular the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 61</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">63</a>.  An application was made to the NNTT
for a determination in respect to land in North Queensland.  The Registrar
accepted material
from mining companies contending that native title had been
extinguished by pastoral leases.  The Registrar did not accept the applicant's
claim on the basis that <i>prima facie</i> it could not be made out.  The
President affirmed the Registrar's decision on the ground that <b><i>Mabo No.2
</i></b><i>(supra)</i> had established a principle that the grant of a
leasehold interest conferring rights of exclusive possession, unqualified by
any
right of access in favour of Aboriginal people generally, was inconsistent
with the continuance of native title rights and that where
native title had
been extinguished it could be revived by the common law.  The full Federal
Court made findings of fact which differed
from those of the President but
formed conclusions consistent with the President's decision.  The High Court
held that on the basis
of the material submitted by the applicants their claim
was fairly arguable and the Registrar should have accepted the application.
The High Court declined to consider the question of extinguishment in the
particular case.
<P>

48	The defendants rely on several passages in the judgments of Brennan CJ,
Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ and the separate
judgment of McHugh J as
pointing to, at least, an "<i>exclusive scheme</i>" under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i> and what is said to be the risk, if not the reality of such exclusive
jurisdiction/scheme being subverted by proceedings such as
the present in this
Court.  Such submissions are advanced in support of the "<i>substantive</i>"
basis for the grant of a stay by this Court.  I add that the extracts which
follow, even if to some extent repetitive, usefully
provide a general guide to
and through the legislation.
<P>

49	As to the perceived benefits of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, their Honours state (at 614):  
<P>

	<i>"Although a claim to native title as defined in Mabo [No 2] was
justiciable, the issues of fact raised by such a claim were complex
and, in the
event of opposition, would be likely to take significant time and resources
(including judicial resources) to determine.
If native title were claimed, the
preservation of the status quo while the claim was awaiting determination would
pose a particular
problem, not only for the claimants and the Crown but also
for those who might be seeking access to the land for mining or other
non-traditional purposes. The preamble to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> indicates the legislative
preference for resolving these problems by negotiation. It contains the
following:</i>
<P>

<i>	`In future, acts that affect native title should only be able to be validly
done if, typically, they can also be done to freehold
land and if, whenever
appropriate, every reasonable effort has been made to secure the agreement of
the native title holders through
a special right to negotiate. It is also
important that the broader Australian community be provided with certainty that
such acts
may be validly done.</i>
<P>

<i>	A special procedure needs to be available for the just and proper
ascertainment of native title rights and interests which will ensure
that, if
possible, this is done by conciliation and, if not, in a manner that has due
regard to their unique character'".</i>
<P>

50	After referring to the "<i>mischief's"</i> (the remoteness of Aboriginal
communities and attendant disadvantages in relation to the identification and
assertion of rights)
their Honours continued (at 615):

	"<i>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> provided a set of solutions for these problems as the following

<P>

<i>	Once a claim for the determination of native title is accepted, a procedure
is set in train whereby the Registrar notifies the relevant
State or Territory
government, persons holding proprietary interests and other bodies and persons
listed in s 66(2)(a), and also
notifies the public (s 66(2)(b)). Those to whom
notice is given under s 66(2)(a) and other persons whose interests may be
affected
by the determination may become parties to the application (s 68).  If
an application which has been accepted under s 63 is unopposed,
then the NNTT
may make a determination pursuant to s 70(1).</i>
<P>

<i>	If the parties to the application agree on the terms of a determination of
the application consistent with the powers of the NNTT
and the NNTT is
satisfied that such a determination would be "appropriate in the
circumstances", the NNTT must make a determination
in accordance with those
terms (s 71).  Failing agreement, the matter goes to mediation and thence
either to agreement by the parties
and determination in accordance therewith (s
73) or to the Federal Court for judicial determination (s 74)".</i>
<P>

51	The nature and importance of the "<i>right to negotiate</i>" is explained at
616-617.  (This right to negotiate, as a sole right, is relied upon by Mr
Sullivan in support of the plaintiff's
position in opposition to the
substantive basis for the stay).
<P>

	<i>"Sub-division B of Div 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 2</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> denies the Governments of the
Commonwealth, States and Territories power (s 28) to confer, inter alia, mining
rights <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 26(2)</a> in respect of land that is the subject of an accepted claim to
native title unless notice of an intention to do so is first given
to the
registered native title claimant (s 29(2)(b) and a procedure is followed
through which ordinarily ( <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 26(3)</a>, (4), 32) requires the Government to
negotiate with the claimants and the miner. The negotiation is assisted, if
desired, by mediation
by the NNTT or other arbitral body (s 31). The procedure
may terminate either in an agreement (s 37) or in a determination by the
NNTT
or other arbitral body that the Government may or may not confer the mining
rights in question (or some other interest to which
Sub-div B applies) or may
do so subject to specified conditions (s 38).  Time limits for applying for and
for making of determinations
of this kind are prescribed (ss 35, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">36</a>). Thus,
once an application for determination is accepted, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> maintains the status
quo as between the registered native title claimant on the one hand and the
Government and those having proprietary
interests or seeking rights to mine on
the other, unless the parties negotiate and agree on the resolution of their
respective claims
or a competent authority makes a binding decision.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is erroneous to regard the registered native title claimant's right to
negotiate as a windfall accretion to the bundle of those
rights for which the
claimant seeks recognition by the application.  If the claim is well founded,
the claimant would be entitled
to protection of the claimed native title
against those powers and interests which are claimed or sought by persons with
whom negotiations
might take place under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. Equally, it is erroneous to
regard the acceptance of an application for determination of native title as a
stripping away of a power
otherwise possessed by Government to confer mining
rights and the other rights to which Sub-div B applies. If the claim of native
title is well founded, the power was not available to be exercised to defeat
without compensation the claimant's native title. The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> simply preserves the
status quo pending determination of an accepted application claiming native
title in land subject to the procedures
referred to. The mere acceptance of an
application for determination of native title does not otherwise affect rights,
powers or
interests.</i>
<P>

<i>	A claim of native title requires an examination of facts that fall broadly
into two categories: the continuity of the connection
of the claimants and
their ancestors with the land in which native title is claimed and the "tenure
history" of that land so far
as it appears from Crown grant, Crown licence or
Crown use. In recognition of the fact that some applicants for the
determination
of native title may be unfamiliar with the requirements of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and may not have the resources to conduct searches of historical or other
documents that may be required to support the application,
s 78(1) confers on
the Registrar the function of rendering "such assistance as the Registrar
considers reasonable to help people
prepare applications and accompanying
material".</i>
<P>

<i>	If it be practicable to resolve an application for determination of native
title by negotiation and agreement rather than by the
judicial determination of
complex issues, the Court and the likely parties to the litigation are saved a
great deal in time and resources.
Perhaps more importantly, if the persons
interested in the determination of those issues negotiate and reach an
agreement, they are
enabled thereby to establish an amicable relationship
between future neighbouring occupiers. To submit a claim for determination
of
native title to judicial determination before the stage of negotiation is
reached is to invert the statutory order of disposing
of such claims".</i>
<P>

52	In his separate judgment McHugh J, conformably with the approach of the
majority, says at 631-2:
<P>

	<i>"Upon acceptance of a claim, a government of the Commonwealth, a State or a
Territory can only grant or vary mining rights, or compulsorily
acquire native
title rights for the benefit of non-government parties, in respect of land
covered by the accepted application if
certain procedures are followed(ss 26,
28).  Those procedures require the government to notify any registered native
title claimant
of such proposed action (s 29).  The government is also required
to negotiate in good faith with the native title claimant and the
parties who
are to be granted rights over the land, with such negotiations to be carried
out "with a view to obtaining the agreement
of native title parties" to the
granting of the rights (s 31).  Relevant matters that may be negotiated include
payments to native
title parties calculated by reference to profits made,
income derived or things produced by the grantee party by using the land (s
33).  If any of the negotiating parties request "the arbitral body" to do so,
it "must mediate among the parties to assist in obtaining
their agreement" (s
31(2)).  The object of these procedures is to produce an agreement between the
parties (s 37) or a determination
by the arbitral body that the proposed right
over, or in respect of, the land should or should not be granted (ss 35, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">36</a>,
38)".</i>
<P>

53	He later affirms the identification of the significance of the structure of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and its Preamble (at 637):
<P>

	<i>Another important circumstance is that the structure of the legislation
makes it clear that the primary role of the Tribunal is to
screen claims and to
assist the parties to reach settlements. If an application is accepted, ss
66-74 provide for procedures that
will result in the application being treated
as unopposed, settled by agreement or referred to the Federal Court for
decision. If
a claim is unopposed or agreement is reached, the Tribunal is
given power to make determinations. If the claim is disputed, it must
be
resolved by the Federal Court if mediation or negotiation fail. The Tribunal
has no role in deciding disputed claims of native
title.</i>
<P>

<i>	Another important circumstance is that the Preamble to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> indicates
that one of the purposes of the legislation is to establish a special procedure
for determining claims of native title
by conciliation and negotiation between
interested parties. In furtherance of this purpose, the effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> is
that, irrespective of whether a claimant has native title as claimed, as long
as the claimant has a prima facie claim of title,
he or she obtains the right
to negotiate with interested parties once the Registrar accepts the claim <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss
26</a>-42, 72).  Those rights of negotiation are valuable rights. They enable an
applicant to protect his or her claim against "permissible
future acts" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
26(2).</a>  They may also result in the applicant obtaining a commercially
beneficial settlement of a doubtful or even non-existent claim".</i>
<P>

54	That these several observations constitute authoritative expositions on the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, its structure, its purpose and importance cannot be
disputed.  Whether this decision of the High Court and others, in the end,
erect
an edifice of jurisdictional exclusivity for which the defendants
contend, is another issue.
<P>

55	As to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court itself, reference was made to
three first instance judgments of that Court.
<P>

56	In <b><i>Djiagween &amp; Ors v Douglas</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/951.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 951</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2048%20FCR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 48 FCR 535</a> the
procedural steps taken in the Supreme Court of Western Australia and the
Federal Court straddled the commencement of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> on 1
January 1994.  The applicants before Carr J had commenced proceedings in the
Federal Court seeking declarations and injunctive
relied against several
parties;  those proceedings were commenced in September 1993.  They claimed
traditional native title and possessory
title to certain land in Western
Australia.  In October 1993 the Federal Court ordered the proceedings
transferred to the Supreme
Court of Western Australia pursuant to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act, 1987</a></i> (Cth).  In January 1994
the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants' claim for interlocutory injunctions
on the basis that the balance
of convenience did not favour the grant of that
relief.  On 2 February 1994 the applicants applied to the NNTT under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> for a determination in respect of the land.  On the
same day, the applicants applied to the Federal Court for interlocutory
injunctive
relief to restrain the respondent from interfering with the land the
subject of the claim.  The State of Western Australia intervened.
 The
respondent and the intervener applied to the Federal Court for orders that the
Federal Court application be dismissed or stayed
pending the final
determination of the Supreme Court of Western Australia proceedings, or that
they be transferred to that Court.
 In the end his Honour held that the Federal
Court had jurisdiction to preserve the subject matter of an application to the
NNTT.
 Carr J declined to strike out the proceedings before him as an abuse of
process and found the preferable course was to transfer
the application back to
the Supreme Court of Western Australia under the cross-vesting legislation.  As
was submitted by Mr Basten
it can only be said of this judgment that its tenor
was that the Federal Court had the relevant jurisdiction.  
<P>

57	The<b><i> Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland &amp; Ors</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/967.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 967</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2049%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 49
FCR 1</a> involved proceedings which again straddled the commencement of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.  Drummond J was confronted with an application for
adjournment of proceedings instituted in the Federal Court claiming
declarations
as to existence of native title.  The applicants (the Wik Peoples)
applied to the Federal Court that the proceedings be adjourned
to enable them
to apply to the then new NNTT.  One of the factors relevant to the adjournment
application was whether a determination
of native title by the Federal Court in
the original proceedings (that is, proceedings not instituted under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>) would operate <i>in rem</i> or <i>in personam</i> and
whether the application were to be made to the NNTT and transferred to the
Federal Court, a determination by the Federal Court
in those proceedings would
operate <i>in rem</i>.  As I have indicated earlier in these reasons, this
judgment is authority for the proposition that a determination of native title
by the Federal Court under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> is a judgment <i>in
rem</i>.  It was in the context of his analysis of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>
(see pp 9 and following) that his Honour came to that conclusion and held
accordingly that to refuse the application for the adjournment
of the
(non-native title) proceedings in the Federal Court and to make a determination
of native title in those proceedings would
result only in a judgment <i>in
personam,</i> while to allow the adjournment and the application to the NNTT
and its transfer therefrom to the Federal Court would enable that
Court to make
a determination of native title which would operate <i>in rem</i>.  Whilst in
the end his Honour did not have to make a decision as to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Court to the exclusion of all
others, he did remark at page 12
having referred to <b><i>Mabo No. 2</i></b> <i>(supra</i>):
<P>

	<i>"But subject to judgment in the action binding all represented persons, any
judgment in this action involving a determination on the
claim to native title
can operate only as  judgment in personam;  as such, it could not bind any
persons, other than those persons
who have been joined as respondents in the
action, who are interested in any of these lands the subject of this action,
including
Aboriginal people who may wish to make different claims to native
title in respect of any of these lands".</i>
<P>

58	His Honour's comments were relied upon specifically in the context of the 16
other indigenous parties with native title interests
in the current application
before the NNTT referred to above as evidenced in the affidavit of Mr
Blackshield vis-a-vis the particular
parties to the application presently
before this Court.
<P>

59	The third judgment of the Federal Court was that Lockhart J in <b><i>Yuin
Council of Elders Aboriginal Corporation v New South Wales</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2060%20FCR%20501" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 60
FCR 501.</a> 
<P>

60	The headnote purports to inform that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> deals with
native title and compensation claims within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> (s <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p66" class="autolink_findacts">66</a>);  there is provision
for "<i>non-claimant</i>" to the NNTT and provisions <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 67)</a> for such
applications to be treated as "<i>unopposed</i>".  Apparently within the
proceedings with which his Honour was concerned, a purchaser of lands
comprising closed lands which had
been sold in pursuance of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands
Act, 1989</a></i> (NSW) had made a "<i>non-claimant</i>" application which was
taken to be unopposed within the operation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 213</a> of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> required that determinations of native title be made in
accordance with the procedures of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and conferred jurisdiction on the
Federal Court in relation to matters arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 24(2)</a>
provided that native title holders could recover compensation from the Crown in
right of a State if the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> giving rise to compensation was attributable to the
State.  The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ra199373/" class="autolink_findacts">Roads Act, 1993</a> </i>(NSW) enabled the Minister to propose
"<i>claiming"</i> (sic) (<i>scil</i>. "<i>closing"</i>) a public road,
specified procedures to be followed and required notice of closure to be
gazetted.  Thereafter such a road ceased
to be a public road and previous
rights of access and passage were extinguished.  The relevant land, if
previously vested in the
Crown, remained vested in the Crown as Crown land.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ra199373/s226.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 226</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ra199373/" class="autolink_findacts">Roads Act</a></i> dealt with claims for compensation.
<P>

61	The applicant in the Federal Court claimed title to land which had formed
roads in the relevant Shire but which had been closed
pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ra199373/" class="autolink_findacts">Roads
Act</a></i> and sold to P. The applicant submitted that any extinguishment of
native title on the creation of those roads was negatived by the
road closure,
so that native title revived and conferred on the applicant a right to
compensation in pursuance of s 24(2) of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.  His
Honour held that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 213(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> was limited to matters
arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> itself and such jurisdiction did not extend to
determining that native title existed at certain times.  In this regard his
Honour
followed Carr J in <b><i>Djaigween</i></b> (<i>supra</i>).  Further, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
213(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> confers no jurisdiction on the Federal
Court, it merely governs the exercise by the Court of a jurisdiction it
acquires elsewhere.
 Further, the <i>"motion</i>" (<i>sic</i>- his Honour uses
the word "<i>notion</i>") of re-establishment of native title is unsupported by
authority and inconsistent with the very concept of native title.  To succeed
in a claim under s 24(2) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, the claimant would
need to demonstrate, not re-establishment, but extinguishment of title.  His
Honour therefore dismissed the application
as disclosing no reasonable cause of
action.
<P>

62	From p 505 onwards his Honour analyses the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> and the
relevant procedures thereunder.
<P>

63	At p 508 having outlined the procedure for a claim for compensation being
made to the Registrar, his Honour deals with the situation
where no
determination is made by the Tribunal and the Registrar lodges an application
with the Federal Court.  It is then that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> comes into play:  it confers
jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine applications lodged
with it under s 74 and that
is an exclusive jurisdiction.  His Honour goes on
to say:
<P>

	<i>"The argument of counsel for the applicant was as follows.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5(2)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</a> (Cth) provides that the Court is a
superior court of record, and a court of law, and of equity.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19</a> of
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> confers upon the Court such jurisdiction as Parliament grants to it.
The Federal Court has jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 213(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>, so
the argument goes, which is a jurisdiction of both law and equity.</i>
<P>

<i>	The essential point made by counsel for the applicant was that because the
power of this Court to make declarations is a very wide
one <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 21)</a>, the Court
must have jurisdiction to simply declare that someone has established a native
title claim over a given piece of land.
 Counsel argued that, although native
title is enshrined in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>, it is fundamentally a common law
concept.</i>
<P>

<i>	The argument is fallacious, because this Court had jurisdiction conferred
upon it under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 213(2)</a> only in relation to matters arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a> itself.  This Court does not have jurisdiction in a case such as the
present one to hold that native title existed at certain times.
 Carr J said in
Djaigween v Douglas <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/951.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 951</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2048%20FCR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 48 FCR 535</a> at 541 and 542, that there is no
provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> for an applicant to initiate proceedings in
the Federal Court by way of an application for determination of native title,
as that
is a function of the Registrar.  I agree with Carr J's
observations".</i>
<P>

64	It is submitted that his Honour's remarks in that context reflect this
present case in reverse, thus further reinforcing, so
it is submitted, the
proposition that substantively by operation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> or
by implication from the overall scheme of that legislation, this Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain the application for relief
by this plaintiff against
the two defendants as set out in the Amended Summons.
<P>

65	As to the grant of a stay on a discretionary basis, the defendants rely on
the "<i>substantive"</i> bases (overall exclusive scheme), to the extent that
they cannot, in a <i>substantive</i> way, found the relief by way of stay.
<P>

66	By the Amended Summons the plaintiff seeks declaratory relief only and
relating to the extinguishment or suspension of native
title rights.  This
necessarily would involve the determination of those native title rights in
respect of which the declaratory
relief is sought.  The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>
deals with what is involved in such a determination (for the purposes of that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>):  s225.  Section 225(b)(iv) provides that upon the determination that
native title exists, there can be determined "<i>in any case the nature and
extent of any other interest in relation to the land or waters that may affect
the native title and interests"</i>.  As I understand the submission made in
this context, it is that the issue of extinguishment or suspension or the
continuance of
"<i>something in between</i>" would be determined upon its
necessarily and inevitable arising in the Federal Court.
<P>

67	Particularly with respect to extinguishment (in the area of the grant of
pastoral leases) the difficulties attending relevant
determinations were
referred to in <b><i>Wik </i></b>at p 132-3 by Toohey J in the post-script as
follows (at p133), his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"So far as the extinguishment of native title rights is concerned, the
answer given is that there was no necessary extinguishment
of those rights by
reason of the grant of pastoral leases under the Acts in question.  Whether
there was extinguishment can only
be determined by reference to such particular
rights and interests as may be asserted and established.  If inconsistency is
held
to exist between the rights and interests conferred by native title and
the rights conferred under the statutory grants, those rights
and interests
must yield, to that extent, to the rights of the grantees.  Once the conclusion
is reached that there is no necessary
extinguishment by reason of the grants,
the possibility of the existence of concurrent rights precludes any further
question arising
in the appeals as to the suspension of any native title rights
during the currency of the grants".</i>
<P>

68	In the litigation in this Court there is no agreement as to what native
title rights and interests there could be in relation
to the subject land.  The
evidence from Mr Emmerig I find to be of no weight either as to the typicality
of the plaintiff's lease
or the ambit of the native title rights and interests
that may affect it.
<P>

69	Given the triggering of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> scheme by the claims
made to the Tribunal, the litigation in this Court, it is submitted, will be
futile unless the plaintiff is
successful in establishing first, exclusive
possession and second, that exclusive possession extinguishes all native title
rights
and interests <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s223.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 223</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> refers to the
<i>"sources</i>" of native title).
<P>

70	Given what the plaintiff would have to here establish to gain, as Mr Basten
put it, any solace from the Western Land Lease, without
regard to possible
native title, there is no evidence or other basis that points even to the
possibility of that which the plaintiff
here seeks positively being established
for his benefit or, authoritatively, for the benefit of other leaseholders, the
more so,
it is argued, when the parties to the NNTT are not parties here and
thus would not be bound by any decision of this Court.
<P>

71	Further, as to discretion, can be taken into account, it is said, the
failure of the plaintiff to institute a non-claimant application
and his
permitting the expiration of about one year after notification of the NNTT
acceptance before commencing proceedings in the
Supreme Court.  Also, there is
no evidence that the plaintiff has, is or is likely to suffer, prejudice as a
result of the native
title issue being unresolved.
<P>

72	The relevant claim having been accepted, the registered claimant has a right
to have the matter proceed to mediation under s
72 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i> and, if the matter cannot be resolved, to have the application referred
to the Federal Court for decision under s 74.  The Federal
Court would have
power to enforce those rights were they otherwise to be denied <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 213).</a>  This
Court would not have that jurisdiction.
<P>

73	Other matters, not subject to oral submissions in chief by Mr Basten but set
out in written submissions are as follows.  The
present relief, it is said, is
an attempt to review the decision of the Registrar of the Tribunal to accept
the application and include
details of the claims on the Register.  Until those
decisions are set aside the statutory entitlements of the claimants remain.
However,
no proceedings have been instituted under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative
Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, 1977</a></i> (Cth) or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s39B</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act, 1903</a></i> to seek to review those decisions.  It is said that the plaintiff
appears to have carefully eschewed such a course.  It is argued
that if that
course had been taken a different issue would have arisen, namely whether this
Court could exercise jurisdiction under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative Decisions
(Judicial Review) Act, 1977</a></i> (Cth) or the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a></i> pursuant to
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act, 1987</a></i>.  Such a course
would require very careful consideration and would, in all probability, simply
not be available, it is argued.  That
jurisdiction is constituted as a
"<i>special federal matter</i>" pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3(1)</a> of the cross-vesting
legislation.  The procedure for dealing with such special federal matters is to
be found in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6.</a>  There is a "<i>high threshold of satisfaction to be met</i>
<i>before a State court determines not to transfer a proceeding to the Federal
Court</i>":   <b><i>NEC Information Systems v Iveson </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2036%20FCR%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 36 FCR 258.</a>
Accordingly, no relief which seeks to have an effect inconsistent with the
operation of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, or which seeks to set aside decisions
made by Commonwealth officers under that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, should be made in the present
case.  It is argued that the commencement of the proceedings in the Supreme
Court of New South Wales
is an abuse of process and thus should be stayed or
dismissed.  
<P>

74	Under the heading "<i>Other Considerations"</i> in the written submissions
the second defendant refers to the Notice given under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78B</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act, 1903</a></i> (Cth).  That Notice was constituted by a letter to the Federal
Attorney-General dated 8 May 1998 from Messrs Blake Dawson Waldron
which is
annexed to the affidavit of Andrew John Chalk sworn 8 June 1998.  The plaintiff
asserts that there are two matters which
raise doubts about the jurisdiction of
the Federal Court to decided an application to determine a native title claim
and to make
orders <i>"directed to the Registrar</i>" in relation to the
purported acceptance of the native title application under s 63 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
These doubts are said to arise, at least in part, from a decision of the full
Federal Court in <b><i>Fourmile v Selpam Pty Limited </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/67.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 67</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20152%20ALR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 152 ALR
294.</a>  
<P>

75	That there may be doubts about the jurisdiction of the Federal Court (which
is not conceded by the defendants), it is argued,
cannot give this Court a
jurisdiction which is does not otherwise have.  In any event, all that was
substantively held in <b><i>Fourmile</i></b> was that sub-division E of Div. 5
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> is invalid.  That sub-division covers ss
166 to 168.  It deals with determinations made under s 160 which in turn refers
to determinations
made by the Tribunal in relation to applications made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
61.</a>  The relevant provisions, as acknowledged in the s78B Notice, are <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a>, 71
and 73.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 70</a> is concerned with unopposed applications and ss 71 and 73
are concerned with determinations made pursuant to an agreement.  That
fact
such determinations cannot be made legally binding by registration in the
Federal Court is said to follow from the decision
of the High Court in
<b><i>Brandy v Human Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
183 CLR 245.</a>
<P>

76	It is submitted that accepting for present purposes that a single judge of
the Supreme Court of New South Wales would follow
that decision of the full
Federal Court, it does not follow that any doubt is thereby cast on the
validity of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 63</a>, 74 and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">81</a>.  The referral of an application to the Federal
Court involves no application of judicial power:  indeed, it is said, the
practice
of the Tribunal, given the doubts surrounding its power to make
determinations which themselves are to be registered in the Federal
Court, is
simply to refer all applications to the Federal Court which can itself, in
appropriate circumstances, make a determination
by consent.  
<P>

77	The approach set out in the s 78B Notice, it is submitted, is inconsistent
with the careful and limited declaration made by the
High Court in
<b><i>Brandy</i></b> and with the limited finding of the full Federal Court in
<b><i>Fourmile</i></b>.  In particular, it is said, it is far from clear as to
how one could argue from proposition that the Tribunal cannot exercise judicial
power of the Commonwealth to the proposition that a section purporting to vest
exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 81)</a> is invalid, an argument that
must also extend to assert the invalidity of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 213(2).</a>  
<P>

78	The reference in the s 78B to the possible invalidity of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction
of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act, 1987</a></i> (NSW) is, it is submitted, beside the
point.  The Federal Court has jurisdiction under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> in
relation to applications for determination of native title and putting the
previous argument to one side, there is simply no need
to go to the New South
Wales cross-vesting legislation.
<P>

79	Finally, it is argued that if the Court is not being asked to rule on those
questions, it is difficult to understand what relevance
they have to the
present proceedings.  The arguments, if pursued, may perhaps indicate a
concession that, even if it were satisfied
that it had jurisdiction, this Court
would not be likely to exercise the jurisdiction which the plaintiff seeks to
have it exercise
in the present case, unless it were doubtful that any other
Court had such jurisdiction.
<P>

80	Mr Larkin of Counsel for the first defendant adopted Mr Basten's submissions
for the second defendant. 
<P>

81	Mr Larkin referred to the structure of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, in
particular <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 68</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a> which provide that once a claim has been accepted,
among others, "<i>any person who holds a propriety interest in any area covered
by the application</i>" is entitled to become a party to the proceedings in the
Tribunal.  The present plaintiff is a party to the proceedings before the
Tribunal pursuant to those provisions.
<P>

82	The first defendant in these proceedings is entitled to exercise the
statutory rights under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> which flow from the
acceptance of the native title claims.
<P>

83	It was submitted by Mr Larkin that the objective of proceedings in this
Court was to mount a collateral attack upon those statutory
rights, a course
which this Court should not permit.
<P>

84	Reference was made to the observations of the High Court as to the two
methods for the resolution of claims in the <b><i>North Ganalanja </i></b>case
(<i>supra</i>) at 625 (that is, opposed and unopposed), it being argued that
the legislation accordingly provides a manner for the plaintiff, should
he wish
to do so, to have any question of extinguishment determined in a binding manner
by the Federal Court;  those proceedings
are presently on foot in the sense
that the claims have been initiated in the NNTT.
<P>

85	It was argued that to commence the current proceedings in the Supreme Court
constitutes an abuse of process where there are other
proceedings in which the
issues raised by the plaintiff could, and should, be raised for determination.
Reliance was placed upon
the observation of Drummond J in <b><i>Wik Peoples v
Queensland</i></b> (<i>supra</i>) at 13 where his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"As a prima facie rule, it is vexatious for a person to institute two
separate proceedings in which the same issue is raised for determination.
 The
principle is applicable whether the proceedings are both by way of court action
or where one only is by way of action, the other
being by way of administrative
process:  see Slough Estates Limited v Slough Borough Council  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20Ch%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] Ch 299.</a>
Although the relief with respect to the applicant's claim to native title
obtainable in proceedings under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> differs from that obtainable in that
regard in this action, the only difference is that while both lots of relief
will determine
exactly the same question, any relief claimed in the
first-mentioned proceeding will bind a wider range of persons than that
obtainable
in the second-mentioned proceeding.  I therefore think it would be
impermissible for the applicants to have on foot the two proceedings
here in
question and that if that were to occur, one of the proceedings would be
stayed".</i>
<P>

86	It is argued that in the present proceedings it is appropriate for the
proceedings to be stayed so that a judgment <i>in rem</i> regarding the
existence of native title, or otherwise, over the subject lands can be
obtained.  Further, the proceedings should also
be stayed because they are
futile.  No declaration that this Court might make in these proceedings can
operate to bind the parties
to these proceedings in the conduct of the
proceedings in the Tribunal or the Federal Court.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 86</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a></i> provides for the Federal Court, in its discretion, dealing with
evidence and findings in other proceedings, including the adoption
of any
finding, decision or judgment of any Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 86(c)).</a>
<P>

87	Insofar as there was a submission in writing by the second defendant to the
effect that to assert that the Supreme Court of New
South Wales has power to
make a determination of the kind encompassed by the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a>,</i> is to assert an inconsistency with a law of the Commonwealth,
the State law must be invalid and inoperative to the extent of such
an
inconsistency pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

88	The first defendant argues specifically that if the Supreme Court, apart
from the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>,</i> had the jurisdiction to make the declarations
claimed by the plaintiff, that jurisdiction has been ousted by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a></i>.  One statement of principle relied upon in support of this
proposition was that set out in paragraph 59 Volume 1(1) <b><i>Halsbury's Laws
of England</i></b> 4th ed.: "...<i>the original jurisdiction of superior courts
may be indirectly ousted where a statute creates a new legal right or
obligation and
prescribes a specific method for its enforcement, whether this
method is by way of proceedings before an inferior court or tribunal
or by way
of complaint or appeal to an administrative authority.  If recourse to the
prescribed procedure is held to be mandatory,
a superior court will not permit
a party to raise the relevant issue before it in declaratory or other
proceedings instead of before
the designated body".</i>
<P>

89	Reliance was also placed upon <b><i>Taylor v The Minister </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%201%20NSWLR%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 1
NSWLR 352</a> in which it was held that the special statutory proceedings for the
determination of compensation consequent upon acquisition of
land by the Land
&amp; Valuation Court impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
to grant declaratory relief.
<P>

90	On the question of ouster, particular reliance was placed upon the decision
of Talbot J in <b><i>Andrew Donnelly &amp; Anor v Tenterfield Shire Council
&amp; Ors </i></b> (Land &amp; Environment Court of NSW, unreported, 2 June
1998).  His Honour after considering the scheme of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>,
the decision of the High Court in <b><i>North Ganalanja </i></b>(<i>supra)</i>,
the decision of Carr J in <b><i>Djaigween</i></b> (<i>supra</i>) and that of
Lockhart J in <b><i>Yuin</i></b><cite> </cite>(<i>supra) </i>said at pp
31-32:
<P>

	<i>"I agree with Mr Hughston (for the Crown) that the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> expressly, or by
necessary implication, ousts the jurisdiction which any State or Territory
Court might otherwise have had to hear
and determine matters </i><cite>arising
under that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a></cite><i>. Under section 251, the Commonwealth Minister may, in
the circumstances described in that section, determine that a State or
Territory
Court or Tribunal (referred to as a "recognised State/Territory
body") can exercise jurisdiction to hear and determine matters arising
under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. The Commonwealth Minister has not made any determination under section
251 in respect of the Land and Environment Court, nor indeed,
in respect of any
other State or Territory Court or Tribunal.</i>
<P>

<i>	In these proceedings the applicants seek recognition of their status as
"native title holders" under the statutory scheme laid down
under the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
Furthermore, they allege invalidity of certain actions by the Minister on the
basis that their procedural rights, "as native title
holders", under the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
have not been complied with. Those procedural rights only accrue if,
ultimately, it is determined that the applicants do in fact
hold "native title"
as that term is defined in the Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, and that their title has been
affected by the Minister's actions.</i>
<P>

<i>	Mr Larkin relies upon the absence of unambiguous and clear words in ss 81
and 213 of the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> to oust the jurisdiction of this Court. In Voth v
Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538</a>, particularly at p 559, the
High Court appears to have preferred, as the relevant test for a choice between
competing jurisdictions,
whether the selected forum is a clearly inappropriate
forum to exercise jurisdiction.</i>
<P>

<i>	This Court is clearly ill-equipped to deal with the evidentiary
requirements for the establishment of native title under the provisions
of the
NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. It is not at present constituted in a way which facilitates holding the
type of inquiries foreshadowed in the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. The procedures stipulated for the
NNTT recognise the peculiar nature of the evidence which may be relied upon to
establish the existence
of native title.</i>
<P>

<i>	Accordingly, it would be inconvenient from the point of view of the
parties, and the Court's own administration, for a native title
claim to be
heard in this Court. Moreover, all of the relevant parties and interests are
not necessarily represented or entitled
to be heard in this Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	The procedural rights conferred on the holders of native title under the NT
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are statutory, not common law, rights. The applicants' claim is that they
are the holders of a form of native title recognised and
protected by the NT
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, and are thereby entitled to assert statutory procedural rights conferred
by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. The claim should be pursued in the manner prescribed by the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
This Court should not circumvent the procedures laid down by the NT <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and
avoid the very forum which the Commonwealth legislature has said is to have
jurisdiction to make determinations of native title"</i> (emphasis added).
<P>

91	I shall return to his Honour's decision in due course.
<P>

92	Mr Sullivan Q.C. for the plaintiff established the context of his client's
proceedings as follows.  The principle relief sought
by the plaintiff is
declaratory as to whether native title, if any, that may have existed over the
land the subject of the lease,
is extinguished by one or more of:  the
provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Western Lands Act, 1901</a></i> or regulations or instruments
made thereunder at any time;  the grant of Western Lands Lease number 7951;
the terms and conditions
of that lease at any time and the entry by the current
or any previous lessee onto the subject land at any time; or suspend for the
duration of the lease.
<P>

93	The plaintiff and the first defendant are New South Wales residents;  the
second defendant is an entity established pursuant
to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land
Rights Act, 1983</a></i> (NSW).  The land in issue is entirely in New South
Wales.
<P>

94	It is said that there are no substantive factual matters that could
reasonably be in dispute in these proceedings which are essentially
concerned
with legal issues only.
<P>

95	The law relating to native title is of recent original and many of the
issues arising have yet to be determined by the courts.
 In particular, which
propriety interests are inconsistent with native title rights has to date been
the subject of relevantly few
court decisions.  
<P>

96	The plaintiff has sought to bring proceedings in this Court because he wants
an authoritative ruling by this Court on the legal
issues raised in the
proceedings;  there is no doubt about the jurisdiction of the Court to grant
the relief sought;  the NNTT cannot
grant the relief sought and in any event,
there is considerable doubt, it is said, about the Federal Court's jurisdiction
to grant
the relief sought at all or in a timely manner.
<P>

97	It is said that the legal issues are matters of general principle of great
public importance to other New South residents because
of the statistical
material to which I have referred earlier in these reasons.  On one issue
advanced by Mr Sullivan namely the typicality
of the lease the subject of the
relief sought, I have already indicated my view that the evidence does not
support a finding that
it is typical.
<P>

98	It is argued that there has been considerable uncertainty generated by
<b><i>Wik</i></b>.  It is said that there is no clear ratio in
<b><i>Wik</i></b> and the majority judgments do not speak with a single voice
on the principles and factors to be taken into account in determining
whether
native title has been extinguished by the grant of pastoral leases.  Examples
of areas of uncertainty arising from the decision
on important issues are said
to include:  the capacity of lessees to use their land, for example, by
installing fences, building
dams or drilling bores and drains;  the capacity of
lessees to change the types of farming practices currently undertaken on the
property;  the diminution in the value of leasehold properties because of the
uncertainty arising from <b><i>Wik</i></b> and the decline in market demand for
the properties and the costs associated with dealing with native title claims,
including the
costs of legal representative and the absence from (and hence
inability to work) the properties.  
<P>

99	Pausing here, I am not persuaded that there is any necessity for me to
decide what <b><i>Wik</i></b> decided or as to whether or not there is any
uncertainty arising from their Honours judgments in that case.  Mr Larkin has
submitted
in reply (see below) that there is no legal uncertainty generated by
the decision;  it has to be conceded, and one cannot ignore
this as a matter of
general knowledge or common sense that it has given rise to some "<i>political"
</i>or<i> "social"</i> uncertainty.  Although there are four separate majority
judgments in <b><i>Wik </i></b>the differences in reasoning in the majority
judgments are minor.  Each of the majority considered that the pastoral leases
in issue
in that case were creations of statute, conferring rights to be
determined by reference to the statute (see Toohey J at 112.7; Gaudron
J at
149.5, 150.6, 152.8;  Gummow J at 176.9-177.1, 187.9, 190.2, 198.2 and Kirby J
at 242.9);  that it is necessary for the statute
to use clear, plain and direct
words before native title will be held to have been necessarily extinguished
(see Toohey J at 123.7,
125.5, 126.4, 127.2, 129.2, 130;  Gaudron J at
154.9-155.4, 161.7;  Gummow J at 168.7, 171.3, 185.5, 193.8, 203.1 and Kirby J
at
247.5-250) and that in the facts of <b><i>Wik</i></b>, there were no such
clear, plain and direct words in the Queensland legislation.  I am grateful to
Mr Larkin for his analysis of
the decision of <b><i>Wik</i></b> for the
purposes of identifying the matters in issue between the parties on the status
and significance of the High Court's judgment
in that case.
<P>

100	It is contended for the plaintiff that this Court has jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act, 1970</a></i> unless it is excluded by Commonwealth
legislation.  There is no legislation and in particular, jurisdiction is not
excluded by the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.
<P>

101	By reason of the New South Wales State connection matters to which Mr
Sullivan referred and which I have set out above, it is
argued that his client
has regularly invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.  Having done so he has a
prima facie right to insist
upon its exercise and to have his claim heard and
determined;  <b><i>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co. Inc v Fay </i></b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20165%20CLR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988) 165 CLR 197</a> at 241.5 per Deane J. 
<P>

102	The proceedings instituted in this Court are discrete and not to be
compared with or confused with an authorised determination
of the NNTT or the
Federal Court and their prosecution in this Court does not affect any rights
which the defendants may have in
the NNTT to the extent to that a decision of
this Court, given the importance of this Court and its standing and reputation,
would
be treated with great respect and authority by another court.
<P>

103	It is argued that the decision of this Court will not be futile first,
because in the mediation process which is thrust upon
a party under the route
for which the defendants contend under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> and contend
to be an "<i>exclusive route"</i>, would be an attempt to compromise rights -
the mediator might be assisted with a determination of this Court in persuading
the parties
where their rights lay; secondly, if the mediation was to fail and
the matter was referred, if it could be referred to the Federal
Court under s
74 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, one might expect within the comity of Courts
in Australia, that a judge of the Federal Court would pay the greatest respect
to a
decision of this Court;  thirdly, a decision of this Court has
ramifications well beyond the ambit of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.  A decision
of this Court would resolve uncertainties in respect of private dealings in
land by a person in the position of the
plaintiff, for example, his ability to
borrow money in a way which could give proper security for the borrowing over
the land vis-a-vis
the defendants who could still maintain any rights asserted
in the mechanism under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.
<P>

104	The Court's jurisdiction to make a declaration is a very wide one and it is
a well accepted principle of statutory construction
that the jurisdiction of a
superior court can only be excluded by the clearest expression of legislative
intent:  <b><i>Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited &amp; Anor

<P>

105	Given and accepting that the plaintiff has the right to have this Court
exercise its jurisdiction, the imperative of the application
of the principle
of statutory construction as to abrogation of that right (or ouster of
jurisdiction) is reinforced, it is submitted,
by what the High Court said in
<b><i>Coco v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 427</a> at 437 per Mason CJ, Brennan,
Gaudron &amp; McHugh JJ:
<P>

	<i>"The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of
a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood
as a requirement
for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed
its attention to the question of
the abrogation or curtailment of such basic
rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or
curtailment
of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an
intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must
be
clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language.  General words
will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they
do not specifically deal
with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often
be ambiguous on the aspect
of interference with fundamental rights".</i>
<P>

106	It is submitted that this Court's jurisdiction under s 23 of its <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> has
not been excluded by express statutory provisions or any necessary implication
for present purposes.  The only Commonwealth legislation
is the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i> and the only express provision in that legislation excluding state
jurisdiction of courts other than the Federal Court and High Court
is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81.</a>
<P>

107	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 81</a> confers exclusion jurisdiction on the Federal Court only to hear
and determine applications lodged with it under s 74.  This is the
nub of the
matter.  (In the instant case there is no evidence that an application has been
lodged with the Federal Court under that
section in relation to the land the
subject of the lease).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 213</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> provides
that, if for the purpose of any matter or proceeding before the Federal Court
it is necessary to make a determination of
native title, that determination
must be made in accordance with the procedures in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and subject to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> the Federal Court has jurisdiction in relation to matters arising under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

108	The plaintiff relies, in effect, on the silence within s 213 to contain a
"<i>mirror</i>" provision with the effect that for the purpose of any matter or
proceeding before any State or Territory court it is necessary to
make a
determination of native title, that determination must be in accordance with
the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, indicating a lack of intention that there be an
exclusive code under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> and positively pointing to
there being, in fact, no such exclusive code.  
<P>

109	Insofar as reliance was placed on the decisions of Carr J in
<b><i>Djaigween</i></b> (<i>supra</i>) and Lockhart J in <b><i>Yuin</i></b>
(<i>supra</i>) by the defendants, in support of the exclusive "<i>code</i>" or
<i>"scheme</i>", I am not persuaded upon reading those judgments that they
provide such a foundation at all merely by reason of the emphasis, particularly
in the latter, given to the existence and operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 213.</a>
<P>

110	The defendants' position as perceived by the plaintiff in the proceedings
before me is that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> confers an exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine
applications lodged with it under s 74.  Notwithstanding that the section
is
silent as to providing that the only way a determination of native title can be
obtained is by the mechanism under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, in any case
where there is a determination as to native title the statutory regime must be
pursued.  
<P>

111	At this point I can indicate my presently held view that nothing in the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> justifies expressly or by implication such a
construction.
<P>

112	The defendants, notwithstanding the position perceived (and, in my view,
correctly) by the plaintiff to have been taken, nonetheless
seek to accommodate
by way of exception cases such as <b><i>Mason v Tritton &amp; Anor
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 572.</a>  In that case a member of the Aboriginal community
had been charged under the <i>Fisheries &amp; Oyster Farms (General) Regulation
1989</i> with having more than the permitted quantity of abalone in his
possession.  He argued unsuccessfully in his defence in the Local
Court that he
had a "<i>traditional right to fish</i>" in the relevant waters and that this
right constituted a native title recognised at common law under the principles
of <b><i>Mabo No. 2</i></b>.  In the end the Court of Appeal constituted by
Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Priestley JA held that the appellant had failed to
establish
that he was exercising a traditional fishing right on evidentiary
bases.  It is in the judgment of Priestley JA (commencing at 595)
that
consideration is given to the enactment of the then recent <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a>.</i>  His Honour deals with the legislation page 595G and Mr Sullivan Q.C.
quite rightly drew my attention to the following passage from
his Honour's
reasons (600C-F):
<P>

	<i>"A further reason for mentioning the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a> (Cth) and
complementary State Acts is that it seems quite clear they have simplified the
process by which assertions that native
title is still on foot in a particular
place can be either validated or found not to have been proved.  The enactment
into statute
of the substance of the Mabo v State of Queensland [No 2]
decision, the provision of statutory definitions for terms previously only
defined (for Australian purposes) in the High Court decision, the provision of
tribunals and courts for the decision of the questions,
and the dispensation
from technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence of courts determining
applications for determination of
native title <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s82)</a> </i><cite>all make it seem
very likely that the best way for common law native title claims to be pursued
will be through the provisions and
procedures of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act
1993</a></cite><i> (Cth). For example, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s223.html" class="autolink_findacts">s223(2)</a> puts beyond doubt the inclusion of
hunting, gathering or fishing rights and interests within the meaning of native
title.  So far
as I am aware there is no Australian decision directly deciding
that this is the case at common law. It may be that in the absence
of statute,
judicial decision would in due course have reached this position. The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act 1993</a> (Cth) puts an end to possible argument about the matter, at
least in cases brought under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. (These comments are confined to common
law claims. Many of the Mabo v State of Queensland [No 2] requirements need not
be proved
in the statutory claims for which the New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/alra1983201/" class="autolink_findacts">Aboriginal Land
Rights Act 1983</a> provides: see Daruk Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister
Administering the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act</a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20140" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 140</a> at 156-158, 159-160)"</i>
(emphasis added).
<P>

113	The discussion by Priestley JA, it is said, does not amount to an
indication that there is any exclusive jurisdiction conferred
upon the Federal
Court or the NNTT with respect to the offence with which the Court of Appeal
was dealing.  I agree but I also agree,
as I have to say, with the statements
by his Honour as to the "<i>best way</i>" for native title claims to be
pursued.  I add, given the <i>obiter</i> nature of his Honour's remarks, that I
am not persuaded by anything in the course of submissions in the matter
presently before me,
that any Australian decisions have directly brought about
that desirable objective.
<P>

114	<b><i>Mason</i></b>, on the one hand, constitutes in my respectful view a
discomforting exception to the basic exclusive scheme stance of the defendants.
It also, on the other, constitutes a pointer to a desirable mechanism and
structure for the determination of native title:  the question
of course in the
proceedings before me is whether or not it can now be said that that position
as advanced for the defendants has
in fact been reached as a matter of
construction or in a substantive way or whether the position has been reached
where by the proper
exercise of discretion a stay should be granted to reflect
and effect that objective.
<P>

115	As to the decision of Talbot J in <b><i>Andrew Donnelly</i></b>
(<i>supra</i>), it is submitted that his Honour was wrong in distinguishing
<b><i>Mason</i></b>.  His Honour having come to the conclusion (at page 36)
that the detailed provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> impliedly oust any
jurisdiction of his court to determine native title issues, particularly in
circumstances where undetermined claims
have been lodged by the applicants,
held that <b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b> was distinguishable on that ground.
His Honour said "<i>the implied ouster results from the scheme of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a></i>".  There is nothing in the judgments in <b><i>Mason</i></b>
(<i>supra</i>) which in my very respectful view which either warrants a
conclusion that there was decided the ouster of jurisdiction or which provides
some basis for distinguishing the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the manner
adopted by his Honour.  If his Honour is to be understood
as saying that
<b><i>Mason</i></b> was wrongly decided by reason of the implied ouster there
is no foundation, in my respectful view, for any such conclusion.  The
only
point of distinction was that in <b><i>Mason</i></b>, of course, there had been
no "<i>undetermined claim</i>" to the NNTT by the person charged with the
criminal offence.  In my respectful view, that does not constitute a basis for
distinguishing
<b><i>Mason</i></b> or coming to a view to the effect that
<b><i>Mason</i></b> cannot constitute, at the very least, the exception for
which the defendants contend.
<P>

116	The regime under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, upon analysis, provides no
basis, it is said, for express exclusion or exclusion by implication of the
jurisdiction of this Court.
 This is demonstrated by the distinction between
"<i>approved determinations</i>" and "<i>determinations</i>".
<P>

117	As to the former, it is said, the whole purpose of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i> and the Tribunal proceedings is to enable a person to have an approved
determination of title the granting of which continues (and,
it is said, only
continues) the right to negotiate in respect of the subject land.
<P>

118	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13(1)(a)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> provides for an application
being made to the Registrar for a determination of native title in relation to
an area for which there
is no approved determination of native title.  An
"<i>approved determination</i>" is one made on application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(1)(a).</a>
(As referred to above, it is agreed that there is no<i> "recognised</i>
<i>State/Territory body" </i>for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13(3)(b).)</a>  Thereafter the
reference to an "<i>approved determination</i>" is in s 24(1)(c) relating to a
"<i>future act</i>" before the making of an "<i>approved determination</i>"
giving rise to a right to compensation if the act extinguishes title:  s
24(1)(d).  One next goes to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55(a)</a> where reference is made to the NNTT and
Federal Court proposing to make an "<i>approved determination</i>" and
procedural consequences which are to follow.  There, it is said, ceases the
references to "<i>approved determinations</i>" except, significantly, for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s193.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
193(1)(a):</a>  Contents of Register - Determinations to be Included.  The
determinations to be included are the "<i>approved determinations of the NNTT,
the Federal Court and the High Court".</i>  It is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s193.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 193(1)(c)</a> which is of
critical importance because it provides for "<i>other determinations of, or in
relation to, native title in decisions of courts ..."</i> to be included in
that register;  a recognition of jurisdiction in another court to make a
determination, albeit not an "<i>approved determination</i>".
<P>

119	Thus far there is, it is submitted, a clear pointer to two routes, the
"<i>approved determination</i>" route via the NNTT and Federal Court or the
"<i>determination route</i>" via another court.  One then goes to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 86</a> which
gives the Federal Court a discretion to adopt any decisions or judgments of any
court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 86(c)).</a>  Thus, it is argued, "<i>parallel streams" </i>are recognised
constituting indicia to the contrary of any express or implied exclusive
jurisdiction which, in clear language, ousts
this Court's jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>.  Thus, there is no "<i>substantive</i>"
basis for the grant of the stay each defendant seeks.
<P>

120	As to whether or not a stay should be granted on discretionary grounds it
is contended for the plaintiff, in the light of communications
passing between
the parties to which I have earlier referred as to an agreed statement of
facts, that the only fact apparently in
dispute is whether or not the plaintiff
has been in occupation of the subject land since 1984.  It is said that that is
a matter
which could be proved by affidavit of some brevity.  That position I
am prepared to accept.
<P>

121	It is next suggested however that it does not matter "<i>one jot</i>" what
the native title is the defendants might have;  whatever it is, it is argued,
that title is extinguished by the grant of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Western Lands Act</a> Lease</i>.
This is said to be a "<i>very short and simple point</i>", obviously within
this Court's competence for its determination.  In this regard I say two
things:  first, in the light of the enunciation
and judicial consideration of
the "<i>common law</i>" of native title rights from <b><i>Mabo No 2</i></b> to
date and including <b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b> <i>(supra) </i>I am not
persuaded that it is otherwise than facile to assert that the nature of the
native title which the plaintiff says is extinguished
matters not "<i>one
jot</i>".  It may well turn out that in the adversarial disputation of the
issue as to native title arising from the very relief sought that
it will
warrant little attention in evidence;  it might turn out that it will warrant a
great deal of evidentiary attention.  The
second matter however, is that
notwithstanding my rejection of the simple proposition put by Mr Sullivan as to
the importance of
the "<i>native title</i>" component in the relief he seeks,
the possibility that it may be agitated and subject to evidentiary and indeed,
legal considerations
in terms of the "<i>common law</i>" of native title, does
not persuade me, by itself, that on a discretionary basis the stay should be
granted.
<P>

122	In oral submissions on the question of discretion reference was made to
delays involved in the "<i>maelstrom"</i> of the meditation process under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> procedure.  It is said that the mediation procedures
under s 72 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> would take considerable time given
that there are 844 parties to the application including 16 Aboriginal parties,
46 leaseholders
and 776 holders of mining interests.  Those parties will have
disparate interests in the outcome of the mediation process.  The plaintiff
disputes the existence of native title, and thus it can be assumed that
mediation of the application will fail as against the plaintiff.
 However, many
if not most, of the other parties may wish to participate fully in the
mediation process.  
<P>

123	It is said that it is extremely unlikely that the issues raised by the
plaintiff in these proceedings would be referred to the
Federal Court for
determination before the completion of the mediation process involving the
other parties to the application, irrespective
of the participation or
non-participation of the plaintiff in the mediation.
<P>

124	The mediation process relating to the application will take considerable
time as the Tribunal must attempt to resolve with clarity
whether native title
exists in respect of the land the subject of the application and if so,
precisely what, if any, native title
rights and interests are preserved with
respect to each of the interests in land held by the respective lessees and
mining interest
holders.
<P>

125	The plaintiff submits that he will be unfairly disadvantaged if he must
wait until the conclusion of such a lengthy mediation
process before his legal
rights can be determined by a superior court.
<P>

126	Accepting, for the moment, these propositions as to the "<i>maelstrom</i>"
and the "<i>Byzantine</i>" process under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>, and even
taking into account the possibility of factual issues being in dispute in this
Court, obviously there could be advantages
in the maintenance of the
proceedings in this Court assuming it to have the jurisdiction which the
plaintiff asserts.
<P>

127	It is at this point, in my view, that the essential considerations as to
whether or not a stay should be granted can be determined.
 The parties
however, in written submissions have dealt with other matters which I should
rehearse though the view I have formed
is that they are not determinative of
the outcome of the proceedings before me.
<P>

128	The plaintiff contends that there are serious constitutional doubts about
the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.  These uncertainties,
it is said, will
not be resolved unless and until the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> is amended in
relevant respects by the <i>Native Title Amendment Bill 1998</i> and which
bill, if enacted, itself will likely to be subject to constitutional challenge.
I shall below deal with the enactment of
the amending legislation.
<P>

129	Moreover, it is argued, if the plaintiff were forced into following the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> procedures the matter could go as far as the High Court
only to encounter a decision that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> provisions
concerning the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and Federal Court were
constitutionally invalid, and that the substantive
legal issues could therefore
not be decided by the High Court in those proceedings (cf:  <b><i>North
Ganalanja </i></b><i>(supra).</i>
<P>

130	It is submitted that the plaintiff should not be forced to await the
outcomes of the Commonwealth legislative processes and
constitutional
challenges and that the substantial injustice to the plaintiff from the delays
and uncertainty should be avoided by
allowing these proceedings to continue in
this Court.  The doubts about the jurisdiction of the Federal Court are as
follows:  jurisdiction
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> in respect of an application does not arise
unless and until the application has been lodged by the Registrar with the
Federal Court
under s 74.  Thus, preconditions to the lodging of an application
with the Federal Court (a) that the Tribunal has not made a determination
under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a>, 71 or 73 in relation to an application;  and (b) that the application
was made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63.</a>  
<P>

131	Section 74 assumes that the Tribunal has power to make determinations under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a>, 71 and 73.  It is strongly arguable that, if those sections are invalid,
the Registrar has no power to lodge an application with
the Federal Court under
s 74;  that it cannot have been parliament's intention that applications could
be lodged if the procedures
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a> - 73 were not available.  It is
strongly arguable, so it is said, that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a>-73 are invalid on the ground that
they are inseverable from the provisions (sub-division D of Div. 5 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 6)</a> for
registration and enforcement of Tribunal determinations in the Federal Court
which were held invalid by the full Federal Court
in <b><i>Fourmile</i></b>
<i>(supra) </i>applying the High Court decision in <b><i>Brandy</i></b>
<i>(supra).</i>  The argument is that parliament could not have intended the
Tribunal to have power to make determinations under those sections if
they
would be unenforceable and so legally futile.
<P>

132	In <b><i>Fourmile</i></b> the Federal Court did not consider whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 70</a>
was inseverable from the invalid registration provisions, and therefore itself
invalid, and was not considered since <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 70</a> was not challenged by Mr Fourmile:
see 152 ALR at 318 per Drummond J.  <b><i>Brandy</i></b> is not relevant on the
consequences under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> of the invalidity of the
registration and enforcement provisions.  Unlike the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>,
the original act in question in <b><i>Brandy</i></b> did not provide for the
relevant Tribunal determinations to be registered in the Federal Court;  the
provisions held invalid in <b><i>Brandy</i></b> had been purportedly inserted
by an <i>"amending</i>" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  The validity of the principal act providing for
the making of determinations by the Tribunal was not in issue.  
<P>

133	It is strongly arguable that if ss 70-74, and 81 are invalid, so too is s
63 on the ground that Parliament could not have intended
s 63 to operate in the
absence of valid provisions for determinations by the Tribunal and the Federal
Court.  In particular, it is
strongly arguable that Parliament could not have
intended to make futile provision for applications to be made and accepted
without
valid provision for legally effective determinations;  or, that the
"<i>right to negotiate</i>" provisions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 26</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">44</a> by holders whose
applications have been accepted by the Registrar (ss 29(2)(b) and 253) should
continue indefinitely (for example,
for mining or "<i>upgrades</i>" to
freehold).
<P>

134	The only other jurisdiction of the Federal Court in proceedings seeking a
declaration would be jurisdiction under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i> (NSW) based on the jurisdiction that is vested
(according to the plaintiff's submissions above) in the Supreme Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>.  It is noted however that the second
defendant in its written submissions contends that there is no such
jurisdiction in the Supreme
Court.  In any event, it is submitted, the validity
of the cross-vesting of State jurisdiction to the Federal Court (like its
jurisdiction
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>) is open to substantial doubt.
The provisions are indistinguishable from the provisions in the State
Corporations legislation which
purport to cross-vest State jurisdiction in the
Federal Court and which have been upheld only by an evenly divided High Court:
<b><i>Brown v Gould</i></b> (1998) 72 ALJR 375.
<P>

135	The written submissions for the plaintiff proceed to deal with various
points raised in writing by the defendants and orally.
 
<P>

136	As to the second defendant's submissions in relation to an application to
the Native Title Registrar pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>
renders this Court without jurisdiction, the plaintiff submits that that
submission would have anomalous results and would be readily
evaded.  It would
mean, for example, that a lessee wishing to undertake activities that would
obstruct the exercise of native title
rights if there were any, could not
obtain a declaration from the Supreme Court that native title had been
extinguished by the lease,
but could only make a non-claimant application under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> and await the lengthy and constitutionally
uncertain outcome of those proceedings.  This could easily be avoided by the
lessee undertaking
a proposed activity for which he could be sued in the
Supreme Court or other court of competent jurisdiction.  On the second
defendant's
submission the Supreme Court or another court would then have
jurisdiction since the proceedings would be for assault, trespass or
the like
and not simply for a declaration as to whether native title existed.  The
plaintiff submits that the Commonwealth parliament
is not likely to have
envisaged such a distinction between proceedings for the purpose of obtaining a
declaration and other proceedings
where the existence of native title is
relevant.  The plaintiff submits that the correct answer is not that the
Supreme Court lacks
jurisdiction but that it has a discretion in appropriate
cases (and the present matter is not one), to stay the proceedings so as
to
allow only the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> procedures to be followed.
<P>

137	As to the point taken in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> that the
State laws otherwise giving jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in these matters
are inconsistent with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> and so invalid and
inoperative, (<b><i>Belmont v General Motors Holden</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2055%20ALR%20142" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 55 ALR 142)</a>
the plaintiff has, served notices under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78B</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a>.</i>
<P>

138	The second defendant submitted that a registered claimant has a right to
have the matter proceed to mediation under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 72.</a>  The plaintiff in response
points to the paradox involved in the second defendant later submitting that
the practice of the Tribunal,
given the doubts surrounding its power to make
determinations which are to be registered in the Federal Court, is simply to
refer
all applications to the Federal Court.  Thus, it is said the second
defendant concedes that there are "<i>doubts</i>" about the Tribunal's powers
to make determinations under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s73.html" class="autolink_findacts">73</a> as the plaintiff has contended
<i>(supra).  </i>It is submitted that a Tribunal practice as described by the
second defendant would overlook the real and substantial doubts about
the
jurisdiction of the Federal Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> (see above).  It must therefore be
doubted whether such a practice has any proper legal foundation.  
<P>

139	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> </i>itself recognises that "<i>determinations of,
or in relation to," </i>native title can be made by the Supreme Court: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s193.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
193(1)(b)</a> and the Register is to contain the relevant information.  There is no
basis for impliedly restricting this provision to proceedings
that do not have
the primary purpose of obtaining a declaration that native title exists, or
does not exist, in relation to particular
land.
<P>

140	There is no inconsistency between the statutory rights of a registered
claimant to negotiate <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 26</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">44</a>), remaining until the claim is removed from the
Register pursuant to a decision by the Federal Court or the High Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
109(2)(b))</a> and the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to make a declaration that
native title has been extinguished.
<P>

141	There is no reason why proceedings in the Supreme Court involving questions
of law that do not involve the interpretation of
Commonwealth legislation to be
stayed.  The Supreme Court proceedings would not prevent the proceedings under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> continuing (assuming the validity of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 70</a>-74 and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">81</a>).  If the Supreme Court made a declaration in the meantime, this would
provide useful guidance in the mediation process (if any)
and in the Federal
Court.  If the matter reached the High Court, the High Court decision would be
followed by the Tribunal and the
Federal Court in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>
</i>proceedings.  If the matter did not reach the High Court, the Federal Court
in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> proceedings could follow the Supreme Court
decision.  If it did not do so, the matter could then be taken to the High
Court.
<P>

142	Insofar as the second defendant suggests that the plaintiff relies on
doubts about the Federal Court's jurisdiction in order
to support the
submission that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</a>,</i> that is misconceived, it is submitted.  The "<i>doubts"</i> are
relied upon to support the submission that the Supreme Court should not
exercise its discretion to grant a stay of the proceedings.
<P>

143	As to the "<i>doubts"</i> raised in the s 78B Notice about the jurisdiction
of the Federal Court in these matters under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i> (NSW) were raised only in the event of the
defendants submitting that the Federal Court would have such jurisdiction.
Since the second
defendant does not make any such submission that aspect of the
s78B Notice can be disregarded.
<P>

144	Issue is joined between the parties on the effect of the decision in
<b><i>Fourmile</i></b> and I do not propose to further agitate it.
<P>

145	In response to the submissions for the first defendant both in writing and
orally the plaintiff rejects the suggestion that
the current proceedings amount
to a collateral attack on any statutory rights of the first defendant under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.  The plaintiff repeats that he merely seeks a
declaration of his rights as lessee and submits that the provisions of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> will continue to apply, but that they do not (expressly
or by implication) preclude the plaintiff from seeking the relief in the
Amended Summons.
<P>

146	Further, in all the circumstances, the institution of these proceedings by
the plaintiff cannot on any view amount to an abuse
of process.  The extract
from the judgment of Drummond J in <b><i>Wik v Queensland</i></b>
<i>(supra)</i> was dealing with the question of two sets of proceedings brought
by the same plaintiff.  The same principles do not apply were the
second
proceedings are brought by a defendant in the first proceeding and there are
good reasons, in the particular circumstances,
for seeking a declaration from
the other court.  Those good reasons I have already referred to in dealing with
the plaintiff's submissions
generally.
<P>

147	As to the suggestion of futility in the first defendant's submissions, it
is submitted that if this Court made a declaration
and the matter reached the
High Court the decision of that court would be followed by the Tribunal and the
Federal Court in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a> </i>proceedings.  If the matter did
not reach the High Court, it is said, it would be fanciful to suggest that a
decision of this Court
would be treated with less than the highest respect of
the Tribunal and the Federal Court.  The decision of this Court could
materially
contribute to successful mediations in this and other native title
claims and considerably influence decisions of the Federal Court.
<P>

148	The first defendant in submissions in reply to all the submissions made by
the plaintiff expresses concern as to what it sees
as an invitation to this
Court to make a finding that there is "<i>doubt</i>" about the constitutional
validity of the relevant provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> as a matter
relevant to discretion on the stay application.  It is said that this Court is
being invited, in effect, to make observations
about the constitutional
validity of the relevant provisions, based on a "<i>doubt</i>" that is,
something less than a certainty.  It is argued that if the Court does so, it
will cast <i>"doubt</i>" on perhaps all of the proceedings in the Tribunal and
the Federal Court arising under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.
<P>

149	It is suggested that for so long as the plaintiff declines to challenge the
constitutional validity of the relevant provisions,
the Court should accept the
constitutional validity of those provisions.
<P>

150	As I have already indicated the resolution of the issue of a stay will be
determined at a point well in advance of the issues
of constitutional
<i>"doubt</i>" or <i>"certainty</i>" raised by the parties.
<P>

151	I must deal however in conclusion with certain oral submissions made by
both Mr Basten Q.C. and Mr Larkin in reply to all that
had been advanced by Mr
Sullivan Q.C.
<P>

152	Mr Basten reaffirmed his client's position that where a matter arose
otherwise than by way of application for a determination
of native title, then
there may well be circumstances in which a State court would have jurisdiction
and he accepted that <b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b> was one and did not seek to
resile from that position.  What he then submitted was that one had to look at
the whole of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> to ascertain what the purpose and
intention of establishing the structure of it is, not merely by reference to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
81</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 82</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s213.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 213</a> in relation to the Federal Court, but also taking into
account the recognised State and Territory bodies scheme to demonstrate that
there was a procedure by which a determination of native title in the sense
used in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, could be done by another process, albeit a process which does
not exist in the present case.  The High Court decisions to which
Mr Basten
referred demonstrated how that Court had addressed the structure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and
permitted the inference to be drawn that contrary to what the plaintiff is
submitting, the structure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> is inconsistent with the suggestion that
this Court has jurisdiction.  The proposition which is put is simply a
constitutional one,
it is said:  if a valid Commonwealth statute (and the
validity of this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> is not challenged), has a particular operation and effect
which are inconsistent with a State law, then the State law must to that
extent
give way and the effect in the present case would be technically upon the
operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>.  
<P>

153	It was submitted by Mr Basten that the question I have to ask is one which
seeks to ascertain the intention of the Commonwealth
legislature, it being the
legislature which has the dominant power in an area of shared power and the
question is really not one
of seeking to take away anybody's rights.  One is
asking whether the Commonwealth Parliament has spoken in a way which is
inconsistent
with what the plaintiff seeks to do in this case.  The plaintiff
now wishes to avoid the delay in going through the procedures under
the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> described as the "<i>maelstrom of mediation"</i>.  It
is suggested that the problem with that submission is that Commonwealth
Parliament appears to have laid that "<i>maelstrom of mediation</i>" down as
the appropriate procedure, for its own reasons, and imposed it upon parties who
wish to intervene.
<P>

154	It is put that it is open to the plaintiff not to intervene;  the plaintiff
can accept that there is native title or allow the
other parties to debate the
issues themselves but, it is submitted, if the plaintiff wishes to take a
position in opposition, which
it is quite entitled to do, then the Commonwealth
Parliament has laid down the procedure.
<P>

155	Insofar as the plaintiff had submitted that it was not open to the second
defendant to seek declaratory relief from the Federal
Court as to the existence
of native title, that was not in issue.  The point sought to be made was that
the Parliament of the Commonwealth
had laid down a procedure and once that
procedure is unavailable because there is a registered native title claim, then
it is simply
subversive of the Commonwealth Parliament's intention to say that
the plaintiff can nevertheless can come to another court and seek
precisely the
same result:  that points to the inconsistency between the Commonwealth <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and
suggested jurisdiction of this Court without, Mr Basten hastened to add, in any
way demeaning the status or jurisdiction of this
Court or the right of New
South Wales residents to have access to it.
<P>

156	Mr Basten rightly pointed to the eschewing by Mr Sullivan of reference to
the decision of the High Court in the <b><i>North Ganalanja</i></b> case,
particularly the passages cited above.
<P>

157	What is submitted by Mr Basten is that there is a logic to that which says
that the structure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, once there is a registered claim, is that the
procedures of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> be followed.  If the High Court in a judgment of its
seven members (Kirby J only dissenting on this point), says that it is not
appropriate
to consider the legal issue underlying the substantive question
namely, whether extinguishment by a pastoral lease had occurred,
then it
follows, so it is submitted, then that is not a question which the Supreme
Court of New South Wales would consider appropriately
to be entered into in the
exercise of some jurisdiction relied upon by the plaintiff.
<P>

158	With respect to what was asserted by Mr Sullivan as to a very limited area
of fact with which this Court would have to deal,
Mr Basten argued that it is
only limited if one assumes that one knows what all the particular bundles of
rights are that constitute
the native title.  Until one has determined whether
there are rights which could co-exist consistently with a pastoral lease, no
decision of this Court would result in any effective order which would bind the
parties.  With so much of Mr Basten of submission
as relates to knowledge of
the bundle of rights concerned, I agree.  The other component of the submission
will not be irrelevant
to discretionary considerations.
<P>

159	Mr Larkin in his oral submissions in reply dealt with various matters
including the plaintiff's submissions in relation to s
213.  It was submitted
that the reason why the section is silent insofar as it does not contain the
posited components suggested
by Mr Sullivan is that the jurisdiction of the
State courts has been excluded.  That is, the jurisdiction to make an approved
determination
by a State court.
<P>

160	As to <b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b>, whilst adopting Mr Basten's
submissions, Mr Larkin added that the first question to be asked is whether
there is jurisdiction in
the NNTT and the Federal Court to determine an issue.
There was no jurisdiction in the NNTT or the Federal Court to determine the
issue of the breach of criminal law alleged against the defendant in
<b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b>.  There can be no exclusion of the jurisdiction
of a State court where there is no jurisdiction in the Federal Court to
determine
the issue that is litigated.  That is not the situation here.  There
can be determinations in other courts in relation to native
title, for example,
<b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b>;  the determination in relation to native title,
if it arises in relation to matters in respect of which the Federal Court or
the
NNTT has no jurisdiction, explains the function and purpose and operation
of ss 193 and 86:  that is<i> "the work"</i> that those sections do.  
<P>

161	In relation to there being said to be no advantage to an "<i>approved
determined" </i>as against any other determination, Mr Larkin referred again to
the decision of Drummond J in <b><i>Wik v Queensland </i></b><i>(supra)</i> and
his holding that the approved determinations are binding <i>in rem</i> as
against the world.  That is an advantage which is far greater an advantage
than, important though it might be, advantage in the
proceedings to the
plaintiff instituted in this Court especially vis-a-vis the procedure under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.  Mr Larkin exemplified this:  in the present
proceedings a declaration by this Court would be binding on Mr Larkin's client
but
not in the Tribunal.  If a declaration was made in the Supreme Court that
native title was extinguished and then later the Federal
Court and the Tribunal
determined that native title existed, what would be the position of the first
defendant?  It would enjoy the
benefit of a finding <i>in rem</i> as against
the world (enjoying native title perhaps to hunt fish or conduct ceremonies).
The plaintiff would then contend that he
is entitled in reliance upon the
declaratory relief granted in this Court to restrain the conduct constituting
the enjoyment of the
native title contrary to the binding <i>in rem</i>
decision in the Federal Court.  This, as I understand the submission, would
constitute a legal and juridical paradox that the due
administration of justice
simply could not tolerate.  This submission is not without some immediate
attraction.
<P>

	<b>The 1998 Amending Legislation</b>
<P>

162	As indicated early in these reasons I have dealt with the submissions of
the parties based upon the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act 1993</a></i>.  Before ruling on the
motions for a stay I now turn to the question of the effect, if any, of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ntaa1998227/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Amendment Act 1998</a></i>.
<P>

163	The principal submission for the defendants was, shortly stated, that the
scheme of the 1993 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> was to vest exclusive jurisdiction with respect to
determination of native title in the Federal Court:  s 81.  That conclusion
followed
from a detailed consideration of the scheme of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> as the Federal
Court did not obtain its exclusive jurisdiction under that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> until the claim
had been lodged with it under s 74.  Lodgment with the Court under s 74 did not
occur until the Native Title Registrar
takes the appropriate step, after
completion of the procedures within the NNTT (including mediation) provided for
in Div. 1 of Pt
3 of the 1993 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

164	The amending legislation came into effect on 30 September 1998.  Schedule 5
provides comprehensive transitional provisions in
relation to applications made
under s 61 of the 1993 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  Where the application has not been referred to the
Federal Court (as is the case here) but is still with the Tribunal, the
application
is "<i>taken to have been made to the Federal Court"</i> (Schedule
5 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> items 6 and 7).  The expression "<i>taken to have been made to the
Federal Court"</i> is a defined expression provided for in Schedule 5 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/index.html#p9" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 9</a> item
36 in the following terms:  "<i>if an application is taken to have been made to
the Federal Court:  (a) the application is to be treated as if it were made to
the
Federal Court under the relevant provisions of the new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>..."</i>  The new
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> refers to the 1998 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> which requires that applications now be made to the
Federal Court (s 61(1)) and the applications must be in a prescribed form and
filed in the Court (s 61(5)).
<P>

165	It fairly can be said therefore that at the commencement of the 1998  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
(30 September) every application pending before the Tribunal will be treated as
having been made to the Federal Court in accordance
with s 61 and accordingly,
as having been filed in the Federal Court.
<P>

166	Section 81 has been amended to now read:  "<i>The Federal Court has
jurisdiction to hear and determine applications filed in the Federal Court that
relate to native title and that
jurisdiction is exclusive of the jurisdiction
of all other courts except the High Court".</i>  
<P>

167	In this context the defendants submit that from 30 September 1998 the
Federal Court will have "<i>exclusive jurisdiction</i>" in relation to this
"<i>claim</i>".  The reference to "<i>this </i>c<i>laim</i>" is ambiguous.
Insofar it is sought to refer to the claim constituted by the application for
relief made in the Amended Summons,
I am not persuaded that the amendments to
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> have that effect at all.  "<i>The claim</i>" in
respect of which the Federal Court will have exclusive jurisdiction is, in my
view, still the claim now deemed to have been made
to the Federal Court but
originally made to the NNTT.  
<P>

168	"<i>The application, saving or transitional provisions</i>" particularly in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> relating amendments relating to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s61.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 61</a> applications, on my reading,
constitute no enactment that in clear and unambiguous language operates
retrospectively either to deprive
the plaintiff of any right to approach this
Court or to preclude this Court giving consideration to the matters otherwise
argued
on the Notices of Motion.
<P>

169	I am not persuaded by the arguments of the first defendant that the
"<i>careful provision</i>" in the 1998 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> with respect to the transitional
effects of the amendments make it impossible to rely upon the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/" class="autolink_findacts">Acts
Interpretation Act 1901</a></i> (Cth), (cf.  <b><i>Mahboob v The Minister for
Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs </i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/1319.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 1319</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2064%20FCR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 64 FCR 398</a> at 403 and
<b><i>Mahboob (No. 2) </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2065%20FCR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 65 FCR 48).</a>  Indeed, I do not see that the
exercise of this Court's jurisdiction is dependent on s 8 of the <i>Acts
Interpretation 1901</i>.
<P>

170	In the written submissions delivered on 24 September 1998, the plaintiff
states that in the event of this Court forming the
view that it does have
jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's application but that it ought not exercise
that jurisdiction, the plaintiff
then seeks to have these proceedings
transferred to the Federal Court of Australia under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a></i> (NSW).  This generated
no response from the defendants .  In the light of the relief sought and the
whole approach taken to this
case by the plaintiff I find this application
extraordinary.  It has not been argued before me and I do not propose to grant
leave
to the plaintiff, in effect, to amend his Notice of Motion to seek that
relief.
<P>

171	As to the affidavit of 14 October 1998 sworn by Mr Emmerig and the attached
Hansard from the New South Wales Parliament, this
has generated no response
either.  I have perused the material, I do not take it into account in the
light of the view I have already
indicated in the course of these reasons, as
to the role of any issue as to "<i>doubt</i>" will play in the determination of
whether or not a stay should be granted.
<P>

	<b>Rulings - Stay Applications</b>
<P>

172	As to what I have hitherto described as the "<i>substantive basis"</i> for
the grant of a stay (the exclusive jurisdiction, the exclusive scheme or ouster
basis) I am not persuaded that a case therefor
has been made.
<P>

173	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</i> <i>1993</a></i> and the amending legislation of
1998 still provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 81)</a> but
only in respect of claims made under that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  Neither expressly nor by
implication can it be said that that legislation operates to oust the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of this State.  In this respect I accept the
submissions of the plaintiff.  The provisions of ss 86 and 193 (even as
amended) are
critical in this regard.  The "<i>work</i>" such sections perform
as Mr Larkin put it, is not limited, I find, despite the initial attraction of
the submission, to matters
in which the Federal Court has no jurisdiction (cf:
<b><i>Mason v Tritton</i></b> <i>(supra)</i>).
<P>

174	As I have said the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction as provided by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 81</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> such jurisdiction being exclusive to that
Court in matters the subject of claims made under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>.
I am not persuaded that any case thus far decided, including <b><i>North
Ganalanja</i></b> <i>(supra)</i>, has authoritatively and clearly held
otherwise:  that is, any claim made "<i>anywhere</i>" for the determination of
native title rights (but not made under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>) must by
reason of the nature of the claim be determined by the Federal Court of
Australia and under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a>;</i> and any claim made
"<i>anywhere</i>" but at the same time the subject of a <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>
claim must be determined by the Federal Court because it has exclusive
jurisdiction.  As to this latter situation the principles
of abuse of process
may apply to stay the proceedings "<i>elsewhere</i>".  I do not however, find
any such abuse here, not least by reason of the nature of the relief sought nor
by reason of the specific
parties to the proceedings.  Otherwise the
propositions I have just set out, in my view, do not represent the law.
<P>

175	I accept that the plaintiff has the right to approach this Court for the
relief of this kind to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> is directed
and that it can be sought concurrently with the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>
proceedings, but the jurisdiction of the Federal Court under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native
Title Act</a></i> does not exclude them or oust the jurisdiction of this Court.  I
do not see the need (nor otherwise consider it appropriate at this
stage) to
consider and determine any issue said to arise under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 109</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

176	I turn now to the <i>discretionary</i> basis for the grant of the stay.  As
stated earlier in these reasons the defendants of course rely upon the bases
for the substantive
ground for a stay as applying to the exercise of discretion
in the event that they fail on the first basis.
<P>

177	I am persuaded by the proposition that upon the enunciation of the
"<i>common law</i>" of native title rights in <b><i>Mabo No. 2</i></b>
<i>(supra)</i> and the enactment of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</i> <i>1993</a></i>
there has been created in a general sense a corpus common law and statute with
the view to the new legal and factual issues being
resolved uniformly at least,
if not uniformly on a national basis.
<P>

178	It is in this area that the observations of the High Court in <b><i>North
Ganalanja</i></b> and with respect, those of Priestley JA in <b><i>Mason v
Tritton</i></b> (and, indeed, the observations as to practicalities of Talbot J
in <b><i>Andrew Donnelly</i></b>) are very pertinent.
<P>

179	A powerful consideration on this matter is the involvement in the
concurrent process under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i> in respect of the subject
land of all parties whose respective interests can there be determined.
<P>

180	The paradoxical situation to which Mr Larkin referred and to which I have
made reference above in the context of his submissions
in reply is, in my view,
one that simply cannot as a matter of practical reality, be ignored.  Whilst I
do not hold that the prosecution
of the proceedings in this Court would be
<i>"futile</i>" I do seriously question their overall utility, especially in
the light of the submissions made in respect to the resolution of the
competing
claims between relevant parties in the proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i>.
<P>

181	As I have already indicated, I do not accept the submissions for the
plaintiff that the proceedings initiated in this Court
involve the resolution
of a short, sharp and fundamentally simple question of law.  Whilst it might be
the case that as far as the
plaintiff is concerned the disputed question of
fact relating to occupation to which I have referred is one that simply can be
resolved,
the disregard for all that is involved in the parcel of native title
rights sought to be extinguished or suspended by the grant of
relief, cannot be
overlooked.  I am not persuaded that in this area the Court would not be called
upon to consider and decide matters
in relation to any such parcel of rights to
the ends referred to, and to so decide them on what would no doubt be a body of
evidence
the extent of which, for present purpose, remains unknown.
<P>

182	It does not derogate from the authority or standing of this Court or from
the existence of the right of the plaintiff to institute
the current
proceedings to express the view that whilst the Federal Court might not have
exclusive jurisdiction it has appropriate
and activated jurisdiction, the
exercise of which to my mind will bring about practical and sensible resolution
of all claims in
relation to the plaintiff's lease.
<P>

183	I am not persuaded that the plaintiff is prejudiced or otherwise
disadvantaged by the prosecution of the proceedings under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title
Act</a></i>.  It is interesting to note in this regard the Ministerial Media
Release which the solicitors for the plaintiff forwarded to me on
13 August, a
document which proclaims, amongst other things, that the amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
include "<i>new streamlined procedures for processing of native title claims
through the NNTT and the Federal Court"</i>.  I merely remark upon this.  I am
not in a position to make any observation as to the efficiency or despatch with
which the claim
before the NNTT/Federal Court will be dealt with.  On the other
hand, it cannot be said, as I have already remarked in the context
of the
defendants submissions, that the plaintiff acted with promptitude, upon the
initiation of native title proceedings by forthwith
initiating the proceedings,
in this Court.  A year after "<i>acceptance</i>" was allowed to elapse.
<P>

184	Whether what I have acknowledged to be "<i>political"</i> or "<i>social"
</i>concerns arising from the decisions of the High Court and indeed, the
enactment of the 1993 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wla1901163/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, will have been ameliorated by the amendments, I am
not position to say.  No doubt arguments for and against will be rehearsed.
<P>

185	Thus, in the exercise of my discretion I will order a stay for the
following reasons in summary:  (a) the legal "<i>pointers"</i> to which I have
referred arising from the cases to which reference has been made;  (b) the
appropriateness of the present proceedings
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/" class="autolink_findacts">Native Title Act</a></i>
for the resolution of all rights of all parties and all their claims;  (c) the
real question of the utility of the present proceedings
in this Court; and, (d)
the absence of evidence of prejudice or disadvantage to the plaintiff.
<P>

	<b>Ruling - Removal Application</b>
<P>

186	The remaining matter is the plaintiff's motion to have the proceedings
transferred to the Court of Appeal.  In the course of
submissions, towards
their conclusion, my then predisposition was to make no such order.  That view
has not changed.
<P>

187	In my view the observations I have made on the question of discretion in
relation to the stay, as to the lack of simplicity
particularly in the area of
facts and evidence of the proceedings as presently instituted, I do not
consider it appropriate to remove
the proceedings under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(5)</a> and SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p12" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 12</a> r
2.  All relevant aspects were argued before me in relation to the stay
applications upon which I have now ruled.  Whether or not
the plaintiff will
appeal or seek leave to appeal that ruling, I do not know.  In the event,
however, of appellate proceedings being
instituted, the Court of Appeal will
have the availability of these rulings and the reasons therefor as a discrete
matter for its
consideration.  As I have indicated, the statement that the
"<i>central</i>" issue in contention between the parties is whether native
title, if any, that existed is extinguished or suspended, whilst it can
be made
with simplicity, does not reflect, in my view, the reality.  I am not persuaded
that the issue is as starkly stated, even
assuming that its resolution may
affect all Western Land Leases (though the typicality of the present lease is
certainly in issue)
or is one amenable to decision under SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 2 by
itself or by reference therefrom to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

	<b>Orders</b>
<P>

188	In relation to the plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed on 27 April 1998,
order 1 has been made (granting leave to file and serve
the Amended Summons);
orders 2, 3 and 6 are irrelevant given the discontinuance of matter number
10917/98;  accordingly orders 4
and 5 seeking removal to the Court of Appeal
are the only relevant orders and the result therefore would be that the
plaintiff's
Notice of Motion is dismissed.
<P>

189	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed on 27 April 1998 is dismissed.
<P>

2.	In respect of the first defendant's Notice of Motion filed on 27 April 1998,
in the exercise of my discretion, I make Order 1
that the proceedings
constituted by the plaintiff's Amended Summons filed on 27 April 1998 be
stayed.
<P>

3.	In respect of the Notice of Motion filed by the second defendant on 19 May
1998, in the exercise of my discretion, I make Order
1 that the proceedings
constituted by the plaintiff's Amended Summons filed on 27 April 1998 be
stayed.
<P>

4.	As between the plaintiff and the first defendant I order the plaintiff to
pay that party's costs.
<P>

5.	As between the plaintiff and the second defendant, pursuant to the orders
made by Bell AJ on 29 April 1998, I make no order as
to costs.
<P>
