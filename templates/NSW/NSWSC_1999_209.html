<b>99/1998 - APPLICATION OF O'HARA;  RE M</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    This is an application made by a stranger to the first
defendant's family for a declaration that the first defendant is incapable
of
managing her affairs and an order that the Protective Commissioner be appointed
manager of her estate.
<P>

2	The first defendant is clearly a person who is unable to manage her affairs.
She is suffering from severely advanced dementia
of the Alzheimer's type and
she has for some years been living in the Mayflower Nursing Home at Westmead.
She is now some 94 years
of age.
<P>

3	The question that has taken the time in this case is whether the existing
administration of the first defendant's affairs by the
second defendant under
an enduring power of attorney made 6 September 1990 should continue, or whether
the Protective Commissioner
should take over the administration under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a>.
<P>

4	There is very little precedent as to the relationship between administration
under powers of attorney and administration under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a>.
<P>

5	However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a> makes it clear that it is subject
to s 160 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> and s 160 was a deliberate legislative
reform in 1983 to permit people to appoint attorneys to look after their
affairs, so that
the authority would continue after supervening mental illness.
Moreover, s 163G of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> empowers the court to adjust matters
should there be problems with the exercise of the power after incapacity sinks
in.
<P>

6	Accordingly, it seems to me the general flavour of the two Acts is that the
power of attorney administration should continue.
<P>

7	Mr Poulden for the plaintiff pointed to the decision of Cohen J in<b> Miner v
Anderson,</b> 30 November 1998, unreported, where his Honour was concerned that
the attorney appointed under power was a solicitor who would have
conflicts of
interest and difficulties in getting instructions as to how to act.  He would
also have difficulties in fixing his own
fees.
<P>

8	At p 6 of the judgment Cohen J seems to have taken the general intention of
the legislation as indicating that having a continuing
power of attorney has
much in its favour  However, he considered in that case that the conflict meant
that there should be an administration
by the Protective Commissioner. 
<P>

9	In the instant case, there is a conflict in one sense and that is because
there was a transaction in 1992 which an  independent
person might consider was
appropriate for him to investigate and move to set it aside.
<P>

10	The first defendant owned a property at Currarong near or on Jervis Bay and
in 1992 she conveyed that property to the attorney
for $1.  It was clearly a
gift.  The medical evidence that has been tendered by the plaintiff shows that
from 15 October 1990 for
about a year the first defendant was in a generally
confused state.  However, the attorney says that whilst he acknowledges this,
the first defendant's problem was mainly caused by consuming a mixture of
brandy and Valium, and once she had been weaned off the
brandy she
substantially recovered, so that by 1992 she was sufficiently competent to
enter into the transaction.  According to the
attorney she did in fact know
what she was doing.  That of itself might not be enough to allay suspicion, but
the documents show
that she consulted an experienced solicitor in Nowra, who
was both her own and her husband's solicitor, as well as the attorney's
solicitor, and that she herself signed the transfer and not the attorney.
<P>

11	There is still a little suspicion about the transaction because the witness
to the document was a mutual friend and there was
nothing on the face of the
document which would show that it was the free and voluntary act of the first
defendant.  Against that,
it was prepared by a solicitor; it was done openly;
it was, on the majority of the evidence, something that the first defendant had
said she was going to do at some time or other, and it in fact carries out a
devise that is in her latest will, which was made on
6 September 1990.
<P>

12	The transaction having taken place in March 1992, is now seven years old,
and furthermore the attorney would have the advantage
of indefeasibility
provisions of the Torrens Act.  Accordingly, although there must be something
suspicious about the transaction,
it seems to me that a reasonable person with
an estate of about $40,000 would probably not risk that $40,000 on the chance
that that
particular transaction could now be upset.
<P>

13	Apart from that transaction, there is no criticism of the attorney's care of
the first defendant's funds.   I should note that
I appreciate that the
transaction was not only the conveyance of the property but carries with it the
conveyance of the fruits of
the property so that the rents have been passing to
the attorney rather than the first defendant for the last seven years.
<P>

14	The question that I have to decide is whether it is best in the interests of
the first defendant that her affairs be continued
to be administered by the
attorney, or whether it would be better for an independent person, such as the
Protective Commissioner,
to take that role.
<P>

15	On this issue Mr Willmott for the defendants submits that the court should
follow the wishes of the first defendant and permit
her nominated attorney to
manage her affairs.  Mr Poulden submits that in view of possible conflicts, the
Protective Commissioner,
a completely independent expert person, should be
appointed.
<P>

16	In working out what is good for the first defendant I must take into account
her expressed wishes when she was compos mentis,
and that undoubtedly was that
the attorney was a person who she would like to administer her affairs.
<P>

17	The attorney under the will gets the property, which he has already taken in
1992 under the transfer.  A person other than the
plaintiff gets the balance of
the estate and that person has filed an affidavit for the attorney.
<P>

18	The Protective Commissioner has expertise and, as Kirby P said in<b> Holt v
Protective Commissioner</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 227</a>,  administration by the
Protective Commissioner has a number of advantages, including manifest
independence and a dispassionate and
neutral approach.  However, administration
is a matter that comes at some cost and at the moment, perhaps partly as a
result of the
gift, the attorney is doing the administration without cost.
<P>

19	In my view, it is better to leave the matter with the second defendant, the
attorney, and accordingly, I decline to exercise
my discretion to appoint the
Protective Commissioner as manager.
<P>

20	Accordingly, I will make the declaration that the first defendant is
incapable of managing her affairs, but I make no other order
other than an
order for costs.
<P>

COUNSEL ADDRESSED ON COSTS 
<P>

21	As to costs, Mr Poulden has said that the proper order is that each side's
costs should come out of the estate.  He says that
that should flow because
both parties have acted in the interests of the incapable person and the
plaintiff has obtained the appropriate
declaration of incapacity.
<P>

22	He refers to the decision of Powell J in<b> M v K </b>- 24 April 1989, where
his Honour points out that in contrast with the principle that applies in most
parts of the court, in the Protective
List it is not the general rule that in
the absence of special circumstances costs follow the event.  His Honour
said:
<P>

"On the contrary, the principle upon which, in cases such as these, the Court
is accustomed to act is:  what, in all the circumstances,
is the order which is
proper to make?"
<P>

23	The application in<b> M v K</b> was brought by a social worker employed by a
hospital.  However, the main protagonist was the second defendant "C", who was
a daughter
of the incapable person.  Although "C" failed in her application,
Powell J said in that case:
<P>

"I am satisfied that that application was not brought out of any conscious
desire to advantage herself and her children, but was
prompted by her
attachment to her mother, her concern to ensure that K is well cared for and
her sense of duty to her mother and
her late father".
<P>

24	Each case will depend on its facts.  The difference between this case and<b>
M v K</b> is that the plaintiff was really a stranger in every sense.
<P>

25	Mr Poulden objects to me saying this because he says that the plaintiff was
the husband of a person who was treated by the incapable
person as a niece.
However, he was no blood relative.
<P>

26	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a> would not work if people were dissuaded from
making applications for fear of incurring costs, and so, almost as of course, a
social
worker attached to a hospital, or the like, who acted in the course of
their occupation would not be at risk as to costs, even though
the application
is unsuccessful, and may even be entitled to costs.
<P>

27	However, one has to draw the line somewhere.  The plaintiff is not a
relative.  He is an old acquaintance of the incapable person
and he seems to
have thought that something was amiss.
<P>

28	The estate is only a relatively modest one.  As I said earlier, somewhere in
the vicinity of $40,000.  The costs of preparing
and presenting an application
of this nature would normally be in the five figure range, and the effect of
ordering both parties'
costs out of the estate would be to leave the incapable
person with relatively little.  I think that I need to take that into account
when working out what is the proper order to make.
<P>

29	In my view, a stranger who takes it upon himself to make an application of
this nature, which is partially successful, or which
fails, runs the risk of at
least having to pay his or her own costs.
<P>

30	I think that what should happen in this case is that the second defendant's
costs should come out of the estate, as he was brought
here.  I have thought of
the possibility of ordering the plaintiff to pay those costs, but it seems to
me that such an order would
run against the policy of encouraging people to
make proper applications to the court.
<P>

31	Accordingly, I make no order as to the plaintiff's costs and order that the
defendants' costs should be paid out of the estate
of the first defendant.  The
exhibits may be returned.
<P>

 
<P>

 
<P>
