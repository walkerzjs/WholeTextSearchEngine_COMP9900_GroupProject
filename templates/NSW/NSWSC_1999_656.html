<P>

<b>50198/96 	ANZ BANKING GROUP LTD  v  PA WRIGHT &amp; SONS PTY LTD &amp; 8 ORS
</b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	In this matter I delivered reasons for judgment and
directed the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to those
reasons
for judgment and to resolve two outstanding matters as to interest and costs.
In relation to those matters, the plaintiff
has presented short minutes dated
29 June 1999.
<P>

2   	In relation to paragraph 3 of those proposed orders, the
application for indemnity costs is based upon an offer of compromise
as
evidenced in the affidavit of Lindsay Michael Powers sworn 29 June 1999.  That
offer was made on 11 December 1997 and proposed
judgment in favour of the
plaintiff in the sum of $31,000,000 together with orders which appear to be
expressed in terms of what
is claimed in the second amended summons relating to
possession and rectification.  
<P>

3   	No detailed calculation has been placed before me as to the
component of interest that might be seen to be waived by the plaintiff
in
respect of that offer.  However, one could assume that it would exceed $3
million subject to this:  There is some doubt in the
plaintiff's mind whether
the amount of approximately $31,900,000 claimed in the second amended summons
includes a quantum of costs
assessed in accordance with clause 1 of the
cross-deed of covenant dated 8 July 1992, part of Exhibit A.  However, putting
that aside,
the correct approach to the compromise offer, I think, is to treat
it as one which, as things have eventuated, ought represent a
benefit to the
defendants/cross-claimants of at least some $3,000,000.  Nevertheless, I am of
the view that having regard to the
complexity and the nature of the dispute,
which I think I have outlined in some detail in the reasons for judgment, I
would not be
prepared to visit the defendants/cross-claimants with indemnity
costs by reason of their refusal of that offer, particularly having
regard to
the comparatively small amount, although measured in millions, that the
defendants' compromise may have represented to
the
defendants/cross-claimants.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff further seeks an order for costs on a
"solicitor and own client" basis (in accordance with clause 1 of the cross-deed
of covenant dated 8 July 1992) for the period from 11 October 1996.  Senior
counsel for the defendants/cross-claimant opposes the
making of that order on
the basis that it had not been precisely claimed in the plaintiff's summons.
<P>

5   	That submission overlooks the terms of the second  amended
summons of the plaintiff which did so claim costs of the proceedings
and, in my
view, nothing has been advanced on behalf of the defendants/cross-claimants to
indicate any prejudice arising outside
of that oversight and no other basis has
been advanced why such an order should not be made.  However, during the course
of submissions
I noted that there appeared to be no obvious explanation for the
calculation of the costs on that basis from 11 October 1996, that
being the
date of the summons, unless costs as assessed had been included in the amount
claimed in the plaintiff's summons.  The
plaintiff has not be able to confirm
that to be the case.
<P>

6   	Accordingly, the approach I have decided to take is to
decline the making of an order on an indemnity basis and to confine
the orders
to one, being the assessment of costs in accordance with the referred to clause
in the cross-deed of covenant without
limitation as to time and I have amended
that by striking out the following words from paragraph 3 of the short minutes,
namely "for
the period from 11 October 1996 until 11 December 1997, and on an
indemnity basis thereafter".
<P>

7   	In relation to the judgment sum stipulated in paragraph 1
of the short minutes, the defendants/cross-claimants have not been
given an
opportunity of calculating whether that sum has been correctly arrived at.  The
evidence for that calculation is that of
Brian Patrick Soper sworn 29 June 1999
and, in view of the desirability of concluding the matter today as far as it
concerns this
Court, the course I propose to follow is to give judgment in the
terms sought but on the undertaking of counsel for the plaintiff
that that
judgment will not be entered within forty-eight hours without the consent of
the defendants and by giving the defendants
liberty to apply on twenty-four
hours notice should it be necessary to correct that calculation.  I will deal
with that matter when
I come to making the final order.
<P>

8   	In relation to paragraphs 7 and 9 to 11 in the renumbered
paragraphs, I have made alterations in manuscript as follows:  In
paragraph 7,
by adding the words "such writ to lie with the sheriff for twenty-one days
thereafter"; paragraph 9, by substituting
"26" for the figure "19" and "13" for
the figure "6"; paragraph 10, by substituting "20" for the figure "13"; and
paragraph 11, by
substituting "9" for the figure "7".
<P>

9   	In relation to paragraph 8, Senior Counsel for the
defendants has submitted that the injunction there referred to should remain
in
place pending any further order of the Court of Appeal.  In substance I agree
with that approach. However, I think the combination
of paragraphs 8 and 9 in
practical terms will have the same effect.  Certainly it is my intention that
in making these orders and
in granting the stay and suspension referred to in
paragraph 9, it is intended that, in the event of an application for a
continuation
of a stay being made to the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal
will revisit all elements affecting the status quo of the parties
in the event
that a continuation of a stay is granted:  including in that a relook at the
terms of the subject injunction which may
need recasting in the light my
judgment of 25 June.
<P>

10   	Accordingly, on the undertaking of counsel for the
plaintiff not to enter the subject orders without the consent of the defendants
within forty-eight hours of the making of these orders, I give judgment and
make the orders as set out in the short minutes dated
29 June 1999, initialled
and as amended by me and placed with the papers. The plaintiff has liberty to
apply on twenty-four hours
notice in the event that the sum referred to in that
judgment has been calculated incorrectly with the view to reviewing that
judgment
sum.
