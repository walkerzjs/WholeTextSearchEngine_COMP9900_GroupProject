<b>2134/97 - JASON MANDALIDIS AND MARINO RODRIGUEZ  v  ARTLINE CONTRACTORS PTY
LTD AND MARAZA HOLDINGS PTY LTD T/AS L J HOOKER (MASCOT)
PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is a dispute between a vendor and purchaser of
a warehouse and office building near Kingsford Smith Airport
in Sydney.  It
arises because the s 149 certificate attached to the contract of sale did not
disclose that at the date of the contract
there was a Council policy on
aircraft noise.  The purchaser says that the policy affected the land, that the
purchaser was unaware,
but if it had been aware it would not have entered into
the contract, and consequently that it was entitled to rescind the contract.
The vendors disagree.  
<P>

<b>The contract</b>
<P>

2  	On 14 November 1996 the plaintiffs as vendors entered into a
contract with the first defendant as purchaser for the sale and
purchase for
$460,000 of property described in the contract as a warehouse and office at Lot
2 in Strata Plan 52116, 76 Bay Street,
Botany (`the Property').  A deposit of
$46,000 was paid to the second defendant, a real estate agent.  The Property is
part of a
single storey brick warehouse which has been divided into two units.
Unit 2 is located on the eastern section of the building.  The
contract was
entered into pursuant to an auction in which the first defendant was the
successful bidder.  It was the 1992 Edition
of the Standard Form Contract for
the Sale of Land approved by the Law Society of New South Wales and the Real
Estate Institute of
New South Wales, supplemented by special conditions and
annexures.  
<P>

3  	By virtue of s 52A(2)(b) the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW) the
plaintiffs as vendors were deemed to have included in the contract such terms,
conditions, and warranties as are prescribed
by the Conveyancing (Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land)
Regulation 1995</a>, and a notice to that effect was included in the contract.
Clause 7 of the Regulation states that the prescribed warranty for a contract
for the sale of land, such as the contract in the present proceedings, is the
warranty set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of Schedule 3 to the Regulation.  The relevant
warranty is as follows:
<P>

`1.	Except as disclosed in the contract: ...
<P>

(c)	the section 149 certificate attached to the contract specifies the true
status of the land the subject of the contract in relation
to the matters set
out in Schedule 4 (item 3 excepted) to the Environmental Planning and
Assessment Regulation 1994, 
<P>

as at the date of the contract.'
<P>

Hence one turns to Schedule 4 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment
Regulation 1994, the relevant part of which is as follows:
<P>

`12.	Whether or not the council has by resolution adopted a policy to restrict
the development of the land because of the likelihood
of land slip, bushfire,
flooding, tidal inundation, subsidence or any other risk.'
<P>

Thus, in substance the relevant statutory warranty was a warranty that the s
149 certificate attached to the contract specified
the true status of the
subject land on the question whether the Council by resolution had adopted a
policy to restrict the development
of the land because of the likelihood of a
number of specified matters `or any other risk'.
<P>

4  	Special condition 28 of the contract was in the following
terms:
<P>

`28.  The Purchaser shall be deemed to have satisfied itself as to the purposes
for which the Property may be used in accordance
with the requirements of the
responsible authority under the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act, 1979</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act, 1993</a> (including, without
limiting the generality of this clause, any proposals which the Purchaser may
have in respect of the subdivision
or use of the Property) and (except where
required by statute) subject to Schedules 2 and 3 of the Conveyancing (Sale of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation 1995</a> the Vendor makes no warranties with respect to any of
these matters.  The Purchaser shall make no objection requisition or claim
for
compensation in respect to any of the matters or things referred to in this
clause nor shall the Purchaser (except where entitled
by statute) be entitled
to rescind this Contract in respect thereof.'
<P>

Special condition 28 seeks to exclude all vendor warranties with respect to
certain matters, but it is expressed to be subject to
Schedule 3 to the
Regulation, and therefore does not purport to affect the statutory warranty to
which I have referred.  Indeed,
that must be so, because any attempt to exclude
the implied warranty in Schedule 3 would be void:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
52A(4).</a>
<P>

<b>The first s 149 certificate</b>
<P>

5  	As required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52A(2)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, the contract
annexed a certificate issued by Botany Council under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> (NSW).  The certificate stated that `as at the
date of this certificate' (namely 18 June 1996) the land was subject to the
Botany
Local Environmental Plan which took effect on 30 June 1995 (`LEP') and
the zoning was `Zone No.4(b) - Mixed Industrial 4`B''.
<P>

6  	The certificate annexed an extract from the LEP which explained
Zone No.4(b) by (inter alia) setting out the developments which
may be carried
out with development consent, in a list which included development for the
purpose commercial premises or light industries.
 The extract stated that any
development other than the developments which were set out was prohibited.  
<P>

7  	The certificate also stated that as at its date the land was
affected in the manner shown in a table, which included the following:
<P>

<center>
 [ IMAGE ] </center>
<P>


<P>

8  	A separate page of the certificate was in the form of circular
letter from the general manager of the Council, stating `should
you require
information relating to the levels of aircraft noise affecting the property, it
is suggested that you write to the Federal
Airports Corporation', the address
of which was then given.
<P>

<b>Events prior to the contract</b>
<P>

9  	The directors of the first defendant were Mr Leigh Reading and
his wife, Lynne.  Mr Reading's evidence is that he was interested
in buying an
investment property with a view to possible tenancy, and inspected the Property
at the invitation of the second defendant.
 He obtained a copy of the draft
contract and supplied it to his solicitors, David Landa Stewart &amp; Co,
instructing them of his
proposal that the purchaser would be the first
defendant as trustee of the G &amp; G Unit Trust.  David Landa Stewart &amp; Co
obtained
a `pre-purchase building inspection report', which concluded that the
property was in `fair to reasonable condition' and recommended
some repairs,
but did not refer to any intended future use.  However, Mr Reading gave
evidence, which I accept, that he understood
before purchasing the property
that the adjacent property, Unit No.1, had constructed a mezzanine floor which
enabled the inclusion
of office space in that property, and he was interested
in doing the same to Unit No.2.  Mr Reading's intention prior to the purchase,
which I accept to be the intention of the first defendant, was demonstrated by
his conduct immediately thereafter.  He entered into
an agreement with the
second defendant, by which the second defendant was granted exclusive leasing
agency rights over the Property
for a period of three months. 
<P>

10  	David Landa Stewart &amp; Co reviewed the draft contract and on
12 November 1996 they wrote to Mr &amp; Mrs Reading drawing
their attention to
certain `significant matters' in the contract.  Those matters included the
following:
<P>

`5. clause 28 provides that you have satisfied yourself as to the purpose for
which the property may be used.  In that regard we
advise that any prospective
tenant to whom you may grant a lease would have to obtain a development consent
from Botany Council for
the proposed use of the property.  We note that the
property is zoned 4(b) mixed industrial, the primary objective is to improve
the environmental amenity of the locality by encouraging the upgrading and
redevelopment of properties within the zones for light
industrial, retail and
commercial uses;...
<P>

9. the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 149</a> Certificate annexed to the contract provides that off-street
car parking is subject to a development control plan.  We suggest that
you
contact the Council, telephone 9317 0555, and satisfy yourself as to the
off-street car parking permissible under the plan;
<P>

10. the 149 Certificate indicates that aircraft noise may affect the property.
Any information relating to the levels of aircraft
noise may be obtained from
the Federal Airports Corporation, P.O. Box 63, Mascot, 2020.'
<P>

11  	It will be seen that the solicitors drew the attention of Mr
&amp; Mrs Reading to the need to obtain development consent from
Botany Council
for any prospective tenant's use of the property and they drew attention to
what they considered to be significant
aspects of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate annexed
to the draft contract, including the matter of aircraft noise.
<P>

12  	On the same day David Landa Stewart &amp; Co wrote to Baron
&amp; Associates, solicitors for the plaintiffs as vendors, making
comments on
the draft contract.  No comment was made about clause 28 or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a>
certificate, but the letter submitted that a clause which would have permitted
the release of the deposit to the vendors be deleted
and that the completion
date be later than was at that stage proposed.  By letters of 12 and 13
November 1996 Baron &amp; Associates
replied, agreeing that the deposit would
not be released to the vendor and that settlement be nine weeks from the date
of exchange,
but disagreeing with some other proposed amendments.
<P>

13  	I conclude from this evidence that the first defendant and its
directors intended at all relevant times that the Property would
be acquired as
an investment property and would be leased, and that some structural
alterations including the construction of a mezzanine
office floor might be
undertaken in conjunction with the leasing.  The first defendant and its
directors were aware that leasing
would require development approval by Botany
Council.  As Mr Reading admitted in evidence, the level of aircraft noise was
not important
to them as such.  Mr Reading did not take up the invitation in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate to contact the Federal Airports Corporation, although it
was specifically drawn to his attention by his solicitor.  However,
as Mr
Reading also made clear in evidence, anything which may restrict development or
affect the prompt granting by the Council of
development consent would be a
material matter for the first defendant and its directors, because this would
affect the investment
return on the Property.  Nothing in the draft contract,
including the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate, put the purchaser or its directors on notice
that aircraft noise might be a matter relevant to the Council's granting
of
development consent or building approval in respect of the Property.
<P>

<b>After the contract - the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate</b>
<P>

14  	David Landa Stewart &amp; Co submitted requisitions on title on
29 November 1996.  Paragraph 13(b) of the requisitions asked:
<P>

`Are there any restrictions on the use, or development of, the parcel by reason
of the likelihood of land slip, bushfire, flooding,
tidal inundation, noise
exposure, subsidence or any other risk?'
<P>

15  	Baron &amp; Associates replied to the requisitions on title on 5
December 1996.  Their answer to requisition 13(b) was `Not
so far as the Vendor
is aware'.  David Landa Stewart &amp; Co submitted a transfer on 10 January
1997.  
<P>

16  	On or about the same day they received a fresh <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate
which had been issued to Legalco Legal Support Services and was dated 19
December 1996.  The second certificate differed
from the first certificate
annexed to the contract.  Apart from more specifically identifying the property
(nothing turns on this),
the answer to question 10 in Section B, which had
previously been `No', had become `Yes'.  An attachment to the certificate
said:
<P>

`For any responses in Section B that were YES, the following applies: ...
<P>

10. Council's policy on Aircraft Noise Refer to Attachment.'
<P>

17  	The same circular letter, directing the enquirer to the Federal
Airports Corporation for information about the levels of aircraft
noise
affecting the property, was attached to the certificate but in addition, there
was the following attachment to the certificate:
<P>

<center>`THE CITY OF BOTANY BAY
<P>

COUNCIL'S POLICY ON AIRCRAFT NOISE
<P>

ADOPTED 4TH JUNE 1996 AND AMENDED 18TH JUNE 1996</center>
<P>


<P>

`Until such time as a new contour map or any other official documentation
depicting aircraft noise is produced by either the Federal
Airports
Corporation, Air Services Australia or any other appropriate official
Government body with jurisdiction in this matter,
Council should assess all
Applications affected by aircraft noise in accordance with  both the 1992 ANEI
and also the November 1994,
to November 1995, ANEI, adopting whichever depicts
the worst case scenario for the subject site.
<P>

Where the Council is of the opinion that the guidelines provided in AS 2021
cannot be complied with and having regard to Clause
13 of Botany Local
Environmental Plan 1995, Council then should issue a `Deferred Commencement'
Consent which would clearly distinguish
that the Consent is not to operate
until the applicant satisfied Council that the guidelines provided in AS 2021
can be complied
with and that submission of certification from the Federal
Airports Corporation and/or Air Services Australia indicating that the
proposed
development would comply with AS 2021 and will continue to do so for the life
of the Consent, would be considered as complying
with Council's Conditions of
Deferred Consent and would enable the Consent to operate.
<P>

Submission of any other official Government documentation which would
demonstrate to Council that the guidelines provided in AS
2021 can be complied
with and will continue to do so for the life of the Consent would also be
considered as complying with Council's
Condition of Deferred Consent and would
enable the Consent to operate.
<P>

Any property, the subject of a Development Application which, in the Council's
opinion, lies outside the 20 ANEI contour line on
both of the two maps, would
not be the subject of a Deferred Commencement Consent.

<P>

Mr Ray Warren	The Department of Transport, GPO Box 594, Canberra City, 2601'
<P>

18  	The additional material in the second s 149 certificate requires
some explanation.  There is a reference to clause 13 of the
LEP.  That clause
is headed `Aircraft noise', and states:
<P>

`13.	The Council, in determining an application for consent to carry out any
development in an area affected by aircraft noise (as
advised by the Federal
Airports Corporation in terms of ANEF contours) shall take into consideration
the guidelines provided in AS
2021.'
<P>

`ANEF' stands for Australian Noise Exposure Forecast', which is a single number
index for predicting accumulative exposure to aircraft
noise in communities
near aerodromes during a specified time period.  ANEF values taken at
individual positions around an aerodrome
are combined on a map to form ANEF
contours.  The lowest-graded contour is 20 ANEF.  While clause 13 of the LEP
refers to ANEF contours,
the policy set out in the second s 149 certificate
refers to ANEI contours.  An Aircraft Noise Exposure Index (ANEI) is the actual
rather than the forecast noise exposure for a designated previous year,
calculated on the basis of aircraft types, flight frequency,
height and other
matters.
<P>

19  	According to the second s 149 certificate, Council will decide
the question whether an area is affected by aircraft noise by
reference to the
contours shown in two maps produced by the Federal Airports Corporation, namely
the Aircraft Noise Exposure Indices
for 1992 and for 4 November 1994 to 3
November 1995, both of which are in evidence.  The Property is outside the 25
ANEI contour
but inside the 20 ANEI contour in the 1992 map.  The 1994-95 map
is dramatically different from the 1992 document because the later
document has
drastically curtailed the east-west flight path and consequently a much smaller
part of the suburb of Botany (as well
as some other suburbs) is shown to be
affected.  The subject property is shown to be outside the 20 ANEI contour on
that map.  The
Sydney Airport 1995 and 2010 ANEFs prepared by Federal Airports
Corporation also show the Property as outside the ANEF contours,
although those
documents are not identified in Council's statement of its policy.<b>  </b>
<P>

20  	The statement in the second s 149 certificate that Council
should assess applications affected by aircraft noise in accordance
with the
ANEI `which depicts the worst case scenario for the subject site' means that
for the purpose of assessing an application,
Council would treat the Property
as if it were affected by aircraft noise because it is within the 20 ANEI
contour depicted in the
1992 map.  The policy does not require that the Council
must issue a `deferred commencement' consent whenever the property which
is the
subject of an application is affected by aircraft noise, but only that Council
must apply AS 2021 and form a view as to whether
the Standard can be complied
with.
<P>

21  	It is true that the LEP had indicated in 1995 that where an area
was affected by aircraft noise in terms of ANEF contours,
the Council would
take into consideration the guidelines in AS 2021 in determining any
application.  The policy adopted by Council
in 1996 was not itself part of any
development control plan or local environmental plan, but rather appears to
have been one of the
miscellaneous group of council documents which have no
formal status under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> (NSW),
but could legitimately be taken into consideration by a council when assessing
a development application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90(1)(q)</a> or (r) (as in force at the relevant
time):  see P Stein, N Hemmings, P Ryan and L Taylor,<i> Local Government
Planning and Environment NSW </i>(Butterworths, looseleaf, 1993), Vol C, para
[450,205].  The adoption of the policy nevertheless added to clause 13 of the
LEP in
significant ways.  It indicated that pending the availability of new
contour maps, Council would use ANEI rather than ANEF contours.
 In effect,
historical ANEI information would be used as a proxy for ANEF figures.  The
policy also identified the particular ANEI
maps which would be used in order to
determine whether an area was affected by aircraft noise, and stipulated that a
`worst case
scenario' would be used, with the consequence that the Property
would thereafter be treated as affected.  It stated that if Council
formed the
requisite opinion as to the application of AS 2021, the result would be a
`deferred commencement' consent.  More generally,
it drew attention to AS 2021
and clause 13 of the LEP in the context of development and building approvals.
Therefore the adoption
of the policy was a matter of considerable importance,
notwithstanding the existence of clause 13 of the LEP.
<P>

22  	If an application were made to Council with respect to the
Property after the adoption by Council of its amended policy on
18 June 1996,
Council would take into consideration the guidelines in AS 2021.  AS 2021 is an
Australian Standard entitled `Acoustics
- Aircraft noise intrusion - Building
siting and construction'.  It contains a table (Table 2.1) which classifies
building sites
into three ANEF zones, described as `acceptable', `conditional'
and `unacceptable'.  For a commercial building the acceptable zone
is less than
25 ANEF, and for light industrial building the acceptable zone is less than 30
ANEF.  Paragraph 2.3.1 of AS 2021 states
that if the building site is
classified as `acceptable', there is usually no need for the building
construction to provide protection
specifically against aircraft noise, but
there is a cross-reference to Note 3 in Table 2.1.  Note 3 points out that
there will be
cases where a building of a particular type will contain spaces
used for activities which would generally be found in a different
type of
building (eg an office in an industrial building).  In these cases Table 2.1
should be used to determine site acceptability,
but the internal design within
a specified space should meet further standards for aircraft noise reduction in
indoor areas, which
are measured by reference to a `design sound level', which
is the maximum level of sound from an aircraft flyover which an average
listener would judge to be not intrusive or annoying when carrying out the
activity contemplated for that part of the building. 
A chart in Table 3.3 of
the Standard sets out the design sound levels for various kinds of activity,
the figure naturally being higher
for, say, commercial buildings than for, say,
relaxing and sleeping areas. Thus, Table 3.3 shows that relaxing or sleeping
areas
have an indoor design sound level of 50, whereas the figure is 55 for
private offices, 65 for open offices and 80 for light machinery
and bench
work.
<P>

23  	It is appropriate to infer from this information that Council
would treat a development or building application with respect
to the Property
as in the less than 25 ANEF range and therefore classed as `acceptable'
according to the Standard.  Consequently
the building construction would not
need to provide protection specifically against aircraft noise, but if the
building were to contain
spaces used for activities of a different type,
internal design sound levels would need to be calculated and those parts of the
building
may have different noise reduction requirements for building
construction.
<P>

24  	The Property contained a warehouse and office building, which
the defendants were intending to lease.  The evidence indicates
that the
Council would have required a development application for any change of use or
any additions or alterations.  Alterations
to the building, including internal
alterations, may also have required lodgment of building application and the
issue of a building
approval before the works could commence.
<P>

<b>The significance of the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate</b>
<P>

25  	Evidence was given by qualified town planners on behalf of both
parties.  Mr R B Smyth gave evidence on behalf of the first
defendant that in
his opinion, the Council's policy on aircraft noise was applicable to the
subject property because it was located
within the 20 ANEI contour in the 1992
map, and that consequently the policy would apply both to a development
application and a
building application with respect to the site.  He said that
since the policy indicates that an application may receive `deferred
commencement' consent, the application of the property could have delayed any
use on the site for a year or more.  He noted the `then
fairly constant state
of flux in determining runway usage patterns and associated flight paths and
therefore noise exposure forecasts.'

<P>

26  	He elaborated on this point in his report of 2 October 1997, as
follows:
<P>

`4.  The use of the runways at Kingsford Smith Airport, whether they be
north-south or east-west is mostly set by prevailing Federal
Government
policies.  Only extreme weather conditions would cause a deviation from those
policies.  The policy parameters changed
almost immediately after the March
1996 Federal Government election, on the return of the Coalition government,
such that then the
east-west runway was again brought increasingly into
service.
<P>

5.  At the time of the contract and at the time of the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 149</a>
Certificate, the site had the potential to be noise affected, but the extent of
that affectation was not known at that time, and
is still not known as no
Aircraft Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) maps have been produced for the
projected future pattern of runway
usage and aircraft operations.  Because of
this, it was my experience with the Botany Bay City Council that around the
time that
the contract was exchanged, if the land could have been affected by
aircraft noise, Council was taking a very tough stance in regard
to approval of
developments affected by aircraft noise, irrespective of the type of the
development. ...'
<P>

He concluded that he would have advised a purchaser in January in 1997 that
approval from Council would not be a quick and simple
matter because of the
aircraft noise policy, and although a court appeal would be possible if Council
delayed or refused the development
application, the more likely alternative
would have been for Council to issue a `deferred commencement' consent, given
that Air Services
Australia could not provide any certainty about when they
would have ANEF maps or what the ANEF might be.
<P>

27  	The plaintiffs' town planner was Mr C L Hill. Mr Hill's opinion
was that any development application for a change of use of
the existing
warehouse building, and any application for building approval, would have
complied with the provisions of clause 13
of the LEP, and the Council's policy
on aircraft noise would not have had a significant effect in relation to
Council's consideration
and determination of any such application.  He strongly
disagreed with Mr Smyth that an applicant in respect of the Property could
have
been faced with a `deferred commencement' consent which could have involved a
delay of a year or more.  In support of his opinion,
Mr Hill referred to a
subsequent application made in respect of the Property for the addition of a
steel frame first floor structure
over the existing car space, and for the use
of the factory/warehouse for offset printing.  The application was made on 25
June 1997.
 A conditional approval was granted by Council on 2 July 1997 and
the applicant was advised of Council's requirements in relation
to building
approval on 17 July 1997.  Council did not seek to apply any special conditions
in relation to airport noise. 
<P>

28  	I prefer the evidence of Mr Smyth to Mr Hill's evidence for
several reasons.  First, Mr Hill's opinion is influenced by the
outcome of an
application made on 25 June 1997, a substantial time after the making of the
contract, the issue of the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate, and the purchaser's
purported rescission.  Mr Smyth's opinion is based on experience in January
1997.  Although the
case about which Mr Smyth gave evidence was obviously
different from the present case in many ways, it put Mr Smyth in contact with
the Council's officers and enabled him to assess their attitude at a time close
to the significant events in this case.  He therefore
had a more reliable
empirical basis than Mr Hill for his opinion that Council was at the relevant
time taking a `very tough stance'
in regard to approval of developments
affected by aircraft noise, irrespective of the type of the development.  He
also gave evidence
that Council reviewed its June 1996 policy on developments
affected by aircraft noise in March 1997, and so by June 1997 the policy
circumstances had changed.  Consequently I give weight to Mr Smyth's assessment
that Mr Hill's example is `totally irrelevant' and
I generally prefer Mr
Smyth's evidence.
<P>

29  	Additionally, I have concluded that Mr Hill's opinions are
expressed too categorically to be entirely in accordance with the
documents.
In particular, at page 13 of his report he refers to AS 2021 and relies on the
definition of `Acceptable' in Table 2.1
at page 9 of the Standard.  He quotes
the statement that `there is usually no need for the building construction to
provide protection
specifically against aircraft noise', but he makes no
reference to Note 3 to Table 2.1, which is specifically referred to in the
explication of `Acceptable' at paragraph 2.3.1.  As I have pointed out, Note 3
contemplates that a building of a particular type
may contain spaces used for
different activities leading to different requirements for internal design
sound levels and therefore
different construction requirements.  
<P>

30  	Mr Hill drew attention to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 96(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning
and Assessment Act</a> as in force at the time, according to which, if Council does
not determine a development application with 40 days of its lodgment,
it is
deemed to have refused consent and therefore at that time, the unsuccessful
applicant may appeal to the Land and Environment
Court for relief.  On that
basis Mr Hill concluded that it would highly unlikely that an applicant would
experience any undue delay,
even if Council were unable to make a decision in
respect of the application.  In my opinion this is an obvious non sequitur.
The
fact that an appeal right crystallises after 40 days does not ensure the
expeditious resolution of a dispute about an application,
and at the very least
a delay of 40 days, which may be commercially unacceptable, would be entailed.

<P>

<b>The first defendant's attitude to the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate</b>
<P>

31  	Mr Reading's evidence is that he and the first defendant did not
become aware that the Property was affected by Council's policy
on aircraft
noise, as set out in the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate, until he was informed of
that fact by David Landa Stewart &amp; Co on or about 13 January 1997.  He said
that had the
matter been disclosed to him on or before 14 November 1996, the
first defendant would not have entered into the contract.  He said
that he
would not have been interested in viewing the property or making further
inquiries in relation to it prior to the auction,
and would not have been
interested in attending the auction and bidding for the property.  I accept
this evidence.  While it is self-serving,
it is supported by external
circumstances from which inferences may be drawn, as I shall explain. 
<P>

32  	David Landa Stewart &amp; Co wrote to Baron &amp; Associates on
13 January 1997 enclosing a copy of the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate and drawing
attention to the differences between the first and the second certificate.
They said:
<P>

`It is our view that the property is substantially or materially different from
that which our client contracted to buy and our
client reserves its rights
under the contract.'
<P>

<b>Effect of Council's policy on the value of the Property</b>
<P>

33  	There is some evidence to substantiate the view of David Landa
Stewart &amp; Co that the Property was materially different
from that which the
first defendant had contracted to buy.  Mr S J Reilly, a registered valuer, was
asked by the first defendant
to prepare a report expressing his opinion as to
how the market value of the Property would be affected by the presence or
absence
of the information in the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate.  Mr Reilly
expressed the opinion that if the factory had been bought for owner occupation
or as an investment that required
alterations, there could have been a delay of
three to six months before Council's approval would permit occupation.  This
affected
the value of the property by about 5%, and consequently once the
application of the Council's aircraft noise policy became known,
the Property
was reduced in value by around $25,000.  
<P>

34  	Mr Reilly's evidence was challenged on behalf of the plaintiffs
by another valuer, Mr S Feilich, and by Mr Hill, the plaintiffs'
town planner.
Mr Feilich's opinion was that the Council's adoption of its aircraft policy did
not have any significant effect on
the value of the Property.  Mr Hill
disagreed with Mr Reilly that the effect of Council's policy on aircraft noise
would have necessarily
made it any more difficult to obtain a development
approval that would otherwise have been the case.  It seems to me that Mr
Feilich's
opinion is flawed in much the same way as the opinion of Mr Hill, the
town planner.  Mr Feilich referred to clause 13 of the LEP
and AS 2021, and
observed that a light industrial building is acceptable if it is in an area of
less than 30 ANEF.  He drew attention
to the definition of `Acceptable' which
(he said) indicates there is usually no need for the building's construction to
provide protection
specifically against aircraft noise.  These are the words
used in paragraph 2.3.1 of AS 2021, but like Mr Hill, Mr Feilich omitted
the
cross-reference in that paragraph to Note 3 of Table 2.1, to the effect that if
a building contains spaces used for different
activities, internal design
levels must be considered for those spaces.  Mr Feilich said that Mr Reilly was
unduly pessimistic in
contemplating a delay of three to six months in Council's
assessment of an application, relying on the speedy processing of the
application
made on 25 June 1997.  However, as I have already found, the
application of June 1997 was of little or no relevance to the position
in the
period from November 1996 to January 1997.  I therefore generally accept the
evidence of Mr Reilly in preference to Mr Feilich's
evidence, as showing that
Council's policy had a significant effect on the value of the Property.  It is
unnecessary for me to make
any finding on the specific degree of delay which he
predicted, or the specific effect on value which he assessed.
<P>

<b>Rescission and termination</b>

<P>

We have been instructed by the purchaser to rescind the contract dated 14
November 1996 for the sale of Lot 2 in Strata Plan 52116
known as 76 Bay
Street, Botany pursuant to clause 20(1) of the Conveyancing (Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land)
Regulation 1995</a>, because of the breach of the prescribed warranty under
Schedule 3 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of the Regulation such that the Section 149 Certificate
attached to the contract did not specify the true status of the land the
subject of the contract in relation to the matters set out in Schedule 4 (Item
3 excepted) to the Environmental Planning &amp;  Assessment
Regulation 1994.
In particular the land was affected at the date of the making of the contract
by the Council having adopted a policy
to restrict development of the land
because of the likelihood of the risk of aircraft noise as is indicated in the
Attachment to
the Section 149 Certificate dated 19 December 1996 being
Council's Policy on Aircraft  Noise a copy of which Certificate with
attachments
is enclosed.
<P>

(a)	The breach of the prescribed warranty constitutes a failure to disclose to
the purchaser the existence of a matter affecting
the land;
<P>

(b)	The purchaser was unaware of the matter when the contract was entered
into;
<P>

(c)	The matter is such that the purchaser would not have entered into the

DAVID LANDA STEWART &amp; CO'
<P>

36  	There are issues between the parties as to whether these three
conditions have been met in the present case.  However, it is
not contested
that the Notice of Rescission formally complied with, and was served according
to, the requirements of clause 20 of
the Regulation.  If it was validly given,
the first defendant would be entitled to the refund of the deposit under clause
21(1),
and by clause 21(4) the rescission would not affect any liability under
the contract to pay damages or reimburse expenses. 
<P>

37  	Baron &amp; Associates responded by letter dated 28 January
1997.  They said that it was their client's position that the issue
and service
of the purported notice of rescission was unjustified and constituted a
repudiation of the contract by the purchaser.
 Accordingly, they notified the
purchaser that the vendors terminated the contract, forfeited the deposit
moneys and reserved the
right to sue for damages.  David Landa Stewart &amp; Co
replied by letter to Baron &amp; Associates dated 31 January 1997, setting
out
their contentions for validity of the notice of rescission.  
<P>

38  	Baron &amp; Associates responded by letter of 26 February 1997
setting out their contentions for invalidity of the notice of
rescission and
validity of their client's termination of the contract for repudiation.  They
asserted that the Council policy on
aircraft noise was not a matter within item
12 of Schedule 4 to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation; and
further,
to the extent that the Council policy on aircraft noise incorporated
AS 2021, AS 2021 was not a restriction upon the development
of the land and for
that reason also the policy did not fall within item 12 of Schedule 4.  The
letter claimed that the Property
was not within the land which is affected by
the Council's policy on aircraft noise, because it did not fall within the
relevant
contour lines of the 1992 and 1994/95 maps.  This is not true, because
the Property was within the 20 ANEI contour in the 1992 map,
and the Council's
policy therefore applied to it because Council adopted a `worst case
scenario'.
<P>

39  	In their letter of 26 February 1997 Baron &amp; Associates
rejected the first defendant's claim that it would not have entered
into the
contract had it or its officers been aware of the existence of the Council's
aircraft noise policy.  However, they invited
the first defendant to put
forward evidence to establish that this state of mind existed at the time of
the contract, and specifically
invited evidence of inquiries made on behalf of
the first defendant between the time when it became aware of the aircraft noise
policy
(13 January 1997, according to my finding) and the time of issue of the
notice of rescission, including evidence of communications
with the Federal
Airports Corporation.
<P>

40  	There is no evidence of any reply to the invitation by or on
behalf of the first defendant.  However, in my opinion no adverse
inference
flows from the absence of a reply.  The second s 149 certificate informed the
first defendant that in the Council's view,
the Property was subject to the
policy on aircraft noise.  There is no evidence that the first defendant or Mr
Reading was aware
of anything which might cast doubt on the Council's opinion
that the policy applied to the Property.  Mr Reading's evidence is that
he
approached the Council to find out their attitude to a development application
for the Property when he discovered the policy
on aircraft noise, but he failed
to obtain any guidance, other than that the policy would taken into account.
He formed the view
that there was a `restriction' which would affect any
application, and was concerned about what the restriction would entail.  In
my
opinion, it was not unreasonable for the first defendant to make no further
inquiries with the Council or the Federal Airports
Corporation or anyone else
before rescinding.
<P>

<b>The proceedings</b>
<P>

41  	By summons filed on 21 April 1997 the vendors as plaintiffs took
proceedings against the purchaser as first defendant and Marazo
Holdings Pty
Ltd trading as L J Hooker Mascot, the agent which holds the deposit, as second
defendant.  By letter dated 22 April
1998 the second defendant wrote to the
plaintiffs' solicitors confirming that it will abide by any decision or
direction of the Court
but has no desire to participate in the proceedings.
Neither the plaintiff nor the first defendant seeks any order for costs against
the second defendant.  
<P>

42  	The summons seeks declarations that the plaintiffs as vendors
validly terminated the contract and that the deposit has been
forfeited to
them, and an order that the first defendant pay damages for breach of contract.
By a cross-claim filed on 22 May 1997
the first defendant seeks declarations
that it validly rescinded the contract as purchaser and that it is entitled to
the return
of the deposit.  In the alternative, the plaintiff seeks an order
for recovery of the deposit under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW).  The
cross-claimant also claims the costs of investigating title and interest on the
deposit.  There is no claim for specific
performance and the evidence is that
the Property was re-sold by the plaintiffs in April 1997 for a price of $10,000
less than the
price agreed to by the first defendant.
<P>

<b>The statutory warranties</b>
<P>

43  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, the effect of which has
been set out above, was introduced by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1985221/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing (Amendment) Act 1985</a> and
consequent regulations.  In his second reading speech in the Legislative
Council on 13 November 1995, the Minister explained
that the legislation was
designed to require the vendor to disclose certain information about the
property before the contract is
signed by the purchaser, and that by removing
delays between the decision to purchase and the exchange of contracts, the
legislation
would reduce the incidence of gazumping.  He referred to the
concept of <i>caveat emptor </i>which underlay the traditional conveyancing
practices, according to which the vendor is not obliged to disclose defects and
the purchaser
must undertake searches and inquiries in order to ensure that the
property is suitable.  The Minister said (Hansard, 9494):
<P>

`The vendor offering a property for sale has more knowledge than the purchaser
about matters affecting the land, such as easements,
restrictive covenants and
government affectations.  It is preferable for the vendor to furnish
information about the property rather
than to have purchasers competing to
obtain sufficient information to be able to exchange contracts in
confidence.'
<P>

44  	The scope and effect of s 52A were considered by the Court of
Appeal of New South Wales in <i>Timanu Pty Ltd v Clurstock Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%20338" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988)
15 NSWLR 338.</a>  In that case the contract annexed a s 149 Certificate which
stated that the subject land was not affected by any road widening or
road
realignment, any environmental planning instrument or any resolution of
council.  After the date of the contract the purchaser
obtained a s 149
certificate which disclosed that the land was affected by a road widening
proposal adopted by resolution of council
nine years earlier, requiring as a
condition of subdivision consent that a strip of land along the frontage be
dedicated for road
widening purposes.  The regulation made pursuant to s 52A
was at that time different from the present regulation.  The relevant warranty
was, in substance, that at the date of the contract the land was not affected
by any road widening or road realignment under any
resolution of the council,
other than as disclosed by the contract (including the s 149 certificate
annexed to it).  The Court of
Appeal held that there was a breach of this
warranty which entitled the purchaser to rescind the contract.  This was so
although
the council revoked its road widening resolution shortly after the
contract was rescinded.  
<P>

45  	Kirby P (with whom Hope and McHugh JJA agreed) addressed the
legislative policy underlying s 52A in these words (at 339):
<P>

`The plain object of the legislation is to reduce disputes concerning the
representations about the land which are made by the vendor
to the purchaser,
to facilitate a proper judgment about the bargain at the time of the signing of
the contract and to provide, at
that time, a clear indication of the terms,
conditions and warranties upon which the parties agree to contract.
Effectively, the
new procedure shifts the obligation from the purchaser to the
vendor, so that the latter has to supply rather than the former to
discover,
certain basic information about the subject land.  The provision is clearly a
remedial one with a reformatory object. 
The courts should not frustrate the
attainment of that policy by a narrow construction of the legislation, and the
subordinate regulations
made under it.  On the contrary, the courts should
endeavour to facilitate the attainment of the purpose which clearly emerges
from
the legislation, understood in the context of the practices which preceded
it:  cf <i>Kingston v Keprose Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 404</a> at 423.'
<P>

46  	Later in the judgment (at 346) he returned to the question of
legislative policy and said:
<P>

`Typically, a party to the sale of land and its solicitors have comparatively
little time in which to make a decision whether to
rescind or not, following
receipt of information about the land which qualifies or contradicts material
contained in a certificate
disclosed as the law now provides.  Typically, that
party and its solicitors do not have time to shilly-shally.  They have little
time to weigh up the possibilities that a policy may be rescinded (as actually
happened in this case) or that it may not be applied
to their particular case.
A quick decision has usually to be made, as was pointed out in the context of
the earlier contractual provision:
 see <i>Jones v Assef</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%202%20NSWLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 2 NSWLR 13</a>,
15.'
<P>

47  	In terms of the wording of the statutory warranty at the time,
the principal question was whether the land was `affected' by
the road widening
resolution.  Kirby P held that the council's resolution was a burden on the
land with which the owner would have
to deal, given that the right to subdivide
land is a valuable incident to land ownership and the resolution on road
widening would
arise if an application for subdivision were made.  He rejected
a submission that the resolution of council did not affect the land
because it
had no immediate impact but required further steps to be taken.  He considered
that the judgment of Powell J on the meaning
of `affect' in <i>Little v
Piccin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2052%20LGRA%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 52 LGRA 258</a>, 274 supported his conclusion.
<P>

<b>Item 12 of Schedule 4 to the Environmental Planning and Assessment
Regulation</b>
<P>

48  	In the present case, the first question to consider is whether
the first s 149 certificate specified the true status of the
Property in
relation to item 12 of Schedule 4 to the Environmental Planning and Assessment
Regulation.  The certificate stated that
the land was not affected by any
Council policy to restrict development by reason of land slip, bushfire,
flooding, tidal inundation,
subsidence or any other risk.  The certificate did
not conform exactly to the wording of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act</a> and item 12 of the Regulation.  The certificate referred to
whether the land was `affected' by Council's policy, whereas <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149(1)</a> speaks of
a certificate `with respect to' the land specifying matters `relating to' the
land.  But it seems to me that nothing turns
on that difference of language in
the present case.  Another difference is that item 12 refers to whether the
Council `has by resolution
adopted a policy', whereas the certificate stated
that the land was not `affected by any Council policy'.  But again, nothing
turns
on this difference of wording if one assumes (as I do) that a Council
policy could be adopted only by resolution.  Thus, the warranty
given by the
plaintiffs as vendors was, in substance, that the true status of the Property
was that Council had not adopted any policy
with respect to the land to
restrict development by reason of the matters listed in item 12.  
<P>

49  	The next question is whether there was a breach of that
warranty.  The first defendant says that a breach of the warranty is
established simply by comparing the first and second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificates.  In
answer to question No. 10, the first certificate said `no' but the second
certificate said `yes' and referred to
the Council's policy on aircraft noise,
attaching a statement of the policy.  The first defendant says that it is not
open to the
plaintiffs to go behind the second certificate to contend that the
Council policy on aircraft noise does not constitute a matter
within item 12.

<P>

50  	I disagree with the first defendant's submission on this point.
Reliance is placed on <i>Jones v Assef,</i> but in that case the contract of
sale stated that the property was deemed to be affected by a proposal if the
purchaser produced
a written statement of the authority concerned, the
substance of which was other than that the property was not affected by any
proposal
of the authority.  Needham J held that the production of a written
statement produced a conclusive result under that clause, which
could not be
negatived by evidence to the contrary.  There is a provision similar to the
contractual clause in clause 2(b) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of Schedule 3 to the Conveyancing
(Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation</a>.  However, clause 2(b) applies only where the
question to be decided is whether a public or local authority has a `proposal'
in respect
of the land.  That question must be considered in order to determine
whether the land is subject to any `adverse affectation' for
the purposes of
the warranty in clause 1(a) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of Schedule 3, because under clause 2(a)
adverse affectation depends (inter alia) upon whether certain authorities have
`proposals'
of certain kinds as listed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of Schedule 3.  But no
question of adverse affectation is raised in the present case, the issue here
being whether for the purposes
of clause 1(c) Council had by resolution adopted
a policy of a certain kind in respect of the land.
<P>

51  	It is clear from the second certificate that Botany Council
regarded its policy as falling within item 12, since question 10
in the
certificate was framed largely in the language of item 12.  But in the absence
of an applicable provision such as clause 2(b)
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of Schedule 3 of the
Regulation or the contractual provision in <i>Jones v Assef, </i>I do not
regard Council's assertion to that effect in the second certificate as
conclusive.  Council's view, expressed in the second
certificate, is not
irrelevant, just as the view of the council in <i>Timanu v Clurstock </i>that
the property was `affected' by its policy was regarded by Kirby P (15 NSWLR at
345) as `informative'.  However, the question
of the application of item 12 to
the Council's policy on aircraft noise is a question of construction to be
resolved by the Court.
 Although a s 149 certificate is `conclusively presumed
to be true and correct' by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149(7)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act</a>, the conclusive presumption operates only for specified purposes
of which this is not one.  I therefore turn to consider whether
there was a
breach of the statutory warranty as asserted by the first defendant, having
regard to the proper construction of item
12.
<P>

52  	The plaintiffs submitted that Council's policy on aircraft noise
was not within item 12 for three reasons:  
<P>

(i)	the policy was not `adopted ... because of the likelihood of ... any ...
risk', since aircraft noise is not a `risk' within
the ordinary meaning of that
word;
<P>

(ii)	even if aircraft noise if a `risk', it is not a `risk' of the kind with
which item 12 is concerned, since it does not arise
by reason of any natural
feature of the land (as is the case with the other `risks' described in item
12);
<P>

(iii)	Council's policy is not `a policy to restrict the development of the
land', since at most the application of AS 2021 to the
Property could impose
additional requirements with respect to the form of building construction.
<P>

53  	I disagree with these submissions.  As to the first reason, my
opinion is that Council's policy on aircraft noise is concerned
with something
falling within the ordinary meaning of the word `risk'. The Macquarie
Dictionary (revised edition, 1985) defines risk
as `exposure to the chance of
injury or loss;  a hazard or dangerous chance'.  The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary (3rd ed, 1987
reprint) defines `risk' as `hazard, danger;  exposure
to mischance or peril'.  While the former definition speaks in terms of injury
or loss, it does not seem to me that the chance of physical injury or pecuniary
loss is a necessary ingredient of the concept of
risk.  For example, exposure
to the chance of a quarrel or an irritating situation can amount to a risk in
the ordinary sense - thus,
I may chose to speak candidly `at the risk' of
offending you;  or I may take the `risk' of being irritated and kept awake by a
dripping
tap by going to bed without turning it off.  In the same sense, it
seems to me that a policy on aircraft noise which restricts land
development
can be said to do so `because of ... risk', namely the risk that occupiers of
property within the affected area will
be annoyed or distracted by aircraft
noise if the policy is not successfully implemented.  There may be an outer
boundary to the
concept of risk which would exclude the merely trivial, and no
doubt one can envisage borderline cases (such as risks associated
with traffic
noise or visual amenity), but in my view aircraft noise is not on the
borderline.
<P>

54  	Council's policy deals with and responds to the risk of
interruption by aircraft fly-overs in affected areas.  The nature of
the risk
emerges if one peruses AS 2021, a very significant document for the purpose of
Council's policy.  Note 1 to Table 3.3 of
AS 2021 explains the meaning of a
`design sound level'.  It refers to the maximum level of noise from an aircraft
fly-over which,
when heard inside a building by an average listener, will be
judged as not intrusive or annoying by the listener while carrying out
a
specified activity.  The risk here is that in premises within the relevant ANEF
contour, aircraft noise will be judged intrusive
or annoying in the absence of
remedial measures. 
<P>

55  	The plaintiffs' second contention is that even if (as I have
found) the word `risk' is wide enough to cover the present situation,
I should
identify in the matters listed in item 12 a category or `genus' and restrict
the breadth of the word `risk' to the same
category.  The plaintiffs say that
the category identified by the words `land slip, bushfire, flooding, tidal
inundation, subsidence'
is risk arising by reason of natural features of the
land.  I disagree.  I accept that the <i>noscitur a sociis </i>and <i>ejusdem
generis</i> rules of interpretation are available weapons in the armoury of
statutory interpretation.  But they are not always determinative,
and it is
arguable that they are less important now than once they were, except perhaps
in such areas as criminal and taxation laws:
 see DC Pearce, <i>Statutory
Interpretation in Australia </i>(4th ed, 1996), 98-104.  Some judges,
particularly in modern times, have attacked the process of reasoning which
underlies the application
of the rules:  <i>Mattinson v Multiplo Incubators Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NSWLR%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NSWLR 368</a>, 373 per Mahoney JA;  <i>Brewarrana Pty Ltd v Commr.
of Highways (No 2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%206%20SASR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 6 SASR 541</a>, 587 per Wells J.  Without necessarily
going so far, it seems to me that the two rules of statutory interpretation are
least likely
to be of assistance where the legislation to be interpreted has a
remedial and reformatory object, as Kirby P has held to be so (in
<i>Timanu v
Clurstock</i>) in the case of s 52A.  When interpreting such legislation, the
task of a modern court, where the grammatical meaning of the legislation
is
open to doubt, is to adopt the construction which will promote the purpose or
object of the Act (Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW),
s 33).  This involves, as
McHugh JA explained in <i>Kingston v Keprose </i>(11 NSWLR at 423), `a
sophisticated analysis to determine the legislative purpose and a
discriminating judgment as to where the boundary
of constructions ends and
legislation begins'.  After one has had regard to the objects or purposes of
remedial and reformatory legislation
of the kind presently under consideration,
it is unlikely that much room will be left for the application of the old rules
of statutory
interpretation.  
<P>

56  	In the present case, I doubt whether so clear a category or
confining environment arises from the words of item 12 that the
old rules could
be applied with confidence.  Land slip and subsidence affect the land itself,
while bushfire, flooding and tidal
inundation may affect things on the land as
well.  While flooding and tidal inundation will normally (though perhaps not
necessarily)
relate to natural phenomena, land slip, bushfire and subsidence
may be caused by natural events or by human intervention.  If earthquakes
are
another `risk', vibration due to aircraft noise would not be unconnected.
However, my view is that the remedial purpose of s
52A requires rejection of
the plaintiffs' contention, even if (contrary to my view) an appropriate
limiting category can be identified.
 The legislation is intended to allow
purchasers to make contracts with confidence, relying on the vendor's
information and without
the first making their own inquiries about matters
concerning council policies which may affect the use and enjoyment of the
property
purchased.  The existence of a council policy under which there is
risk that a development or building application may be subject
to `deferred
commencement consent' because of standards regarding aircraft noise is a matter
about which a reasonable purchaser would
wish to be informed.  Item 12 should
be construed in such a fashion as to require information on such a matter to be
included in
the s 149 certificate, consequently entailing that the vendor's
warranty under s 52A extends to such a matter.  
<P>

57  	Here it is true that the text for interpretation is in a
schedule to a regulation made under the Environmental Planning and
Protection
Act 1979, made relevant by but not included in the legislation which has been
held to be remedial and reformatory.  However,
it seems to me appropriate to
extend the same approach to the interpretation of item 12 as to s 52A and the
regulations made under
it, given that the Legislature has regarded the text of
Schedule 4 as appropriate to be used in the pursuit of its remedial and
reformatory
purpose.
<P>

58  	Therefore, without pretending to define the word exhaustively, I
conclude that the word `risk' is wide enough on its literal
construction to
include the risk to which the Council's policy on aircraft noise relates, and
that in view of the remedial purpose
of the legislation, there is no basis for
reading down the word by reference to the <i>noscitur a sociis </i>or
<i>ejusdem generis</i> rules of interpretation.
<P>

59  	Mr Hill, the town planner, whose evidence was relied on by the
plaintiffs, expressed the opinion (at page 15 of his report)
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 90(1)(g)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> (as in force at the relevant
time), the wording of which was not materially different from item 12 in
Schedule 4, was concerned with
the suitability of the land in relation to its
exposure to the risks which were stated, rather than the likely impact which
aircraft
noise may have on the use of the site.  This is an opinion at to the
proper construction of a legislative provision. That is not
a matter upon which
expert evidence from a town planner should be given weight.
<P>

60  	The plaintiffs' third contention is that the Council's policy on
aircraft noise is not `a policy to restrict the development
of the land'.
There can be no doubt that the policy on aircraft noise is a `policy' for the
purposes of item 12.  The only question
is whether that policy is appropriately
described as a policy which restricts the development of land.  The plaintiffs
say that at
most, the policy could impose additional requirements with respect
to building construction in accordance with AS 2021.  In my opinion
this is
factually untrue.  As formulated in the second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate, the policy
applies  to any application, including a development application as well as a
building application.  A development
application would be needed, according to
the evidence, before the premises could be put to any new use by the owner or a
lessee.
 The policy would require, amongst other things, that the Council would
assess the new use by reference to the standards applicable
under AS 2021
according to the relevant ANEF contour and the application of Tables 2.1 and
3.3.  The policy in its terms implies
that if the building or any part of it
does not structurally comply with the requirements of the Standard having
regard to the new
use which is proposed, the development application may fail.
In this sense, it is correct to describe the policy as one which restricts
the
development of the land.  
<P>

61  	My conclusion is that there was a breach of the statutory
warranty implied by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52A(2)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 7</a> and
clause 1(c) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of Schedule 3 to the Conveyancing (Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land)
Regulation</a>, and item 12 of Schedule 4 to the Environmental Planning and
Assessment Regulation.
<P>

<b>The right to rescind</b>
<P>

62  	I must now consider whether the purchaser was entitled to
rescind the contract on the ground of that breach.  Section 52A(6)
states that
the regulations may make provisions for or with respect to the remedies and
relief available to a purchaser for any breach
of a warranty deemed to be
included in the contract under that section.  Clause 19(1)(b) of the
Conveyancing (Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation</a> states that the purchaser may rescind
for breach of the warranty referred to in clause 7 in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> of Schedule 3.
Clause 19(3) provides that a contract may not be rescinded on the ground
referred to in sub-clause (1)(b) unless:
<P>

(a)	the breach constitutes a failure to disclose to the purchaser the existence
of a matter affecting the land;  and
<P>

(b)	the purchaser was unaware of the existence of the matter when the contract
was entered into;  and
<P>

(c)	the matter is such that the purchaser would not have entered into the
contract had he or she been aware of its existence.
<P>

63  	The evidence shows that at the time when the contract was
entered into on 14 November 1996, the first defendant was aware of
the
Council's requirements for a development application, but was unaware of the
existence of the Council's policy on aircraft noise,
even though the policy had
been adopted on 4 June 1996 and amended on 18 June 1996.  Mr and Mrs Reading
were advised by David Landa
Stewart &amp; Co that the s 149 certificate
attached to the draft contract indicated that aircraft noise may affect the
property
and that information relating to the level of aircraft noise could be
obtained from the Federal Airports Corporation, but the evidence
is that the
first defendant did not obtain any such information.  Instead, it relied on the
s 149 certificate, which made no mention
of the policy and stated that the land
was not affected by any Council policy to restrict development by reason of
`any other risk'.
 The fact that prior to the contract, the first defendant
made no evaluation of the policies of the Council in regard to development
applications and the likely impact of any such policies on the value of the
property is not to the point.  In light of s 52A and
the legislative policy
underlying it, a purchaser of the Property was entitled to assume, in the
absence of anything unusual in the
s 149 certificate or other parts of the
contract, that any necessary development application would not encounter any
unusual difficulties,
provided that it fitted the requirements of the
appropriate zoning category.
<P>

64  	The plaintiffs submitted that paragraph (a) was not satisfied in
this case.  They said that there was no undisclosed `matter
affecting the
land'.  The meaning of a matter `affecting' the land was explored in another
context by Powell J in <i> Little v Piccin</i>.  He held that a property is not
relevantly `affected' unless the actual or potential effect of the relevant
matter is a legal or
factual prohibition of, or limitation upon, what would
otherwise be the right of the owner to alienate or use the land (52 LGRA at
274).  As I have mentioned, Powell J's reasoning was applied by the Court of
Appeal in <i>Timanu v Clurstock, </i>to hold that (again in a context different
from the present) a council's subdivision policy which required the dedication
of a strip
of land upon subdivision `affected' the subject land.  Kirby P (15
NSWLR at 344) found that the council's policy burdened the right
to subdivide
the land and therefore interfered with one of the rights which the purchaser of
land might reasonably be expected to
enjoy.  
<P>

65  	In the present case, a policy burdening the right to make a
development application falling within the terms of the Council's
zoning
requirements is properly described as actually or potentially interfering with
one of the rights which the purchaser of land
might reasonably be expected to
enjoy.  The plaintiffs say that the Property was only within the 20 ANEI
contour at most, and was
a commercial and industrial building, and that the
noise level was treated as `acceptable' by AS 2021 and the Council's policy.
However,
I have pointed out that AS 2021 might nevertheless have required
compliance with building standards for parts of the premises to
be used for
other purposes (such as relaxation areas), and consequently in my opinion the
policy was capable of imposing a significant
burden even though the basic use
of the building placed it in the `acceptable' range of the standard.  Further,
the evidence is that
during the period from November 1996 to January 1997 the
policy was administered in a manner which would have caused real delay to
any
development application in respect of the Property.  I conclude, therefore,
that paragraph 19(3)(a) was satisfied because the
plaintiffs failed to disclose
the existence of a matter affecting the Property.
<P>

66  	The remaining question, arising under paragraph 19(3)(c),
relates to whether the first defendant would not have entered into
the contract
had it been aware of the existence of the undisclosed policy.  Submissions were
made as to whether paragraph 19(3)(c)
requires a finding as to the subjective
position of the purchaser, or as to the position of a reasonable person in the
purchaser's
shoes.  The Court is required to consider a hypothetical situation
- namely, what the purchaser would have done had it been aware
of something
which in fact it did not know at the relevant time.  The question is not about
`subjective' or `objective' intention,
in fact, since it is based on an
hypothesis.  There is, however, an issue as to whether, in making its
determination, the Court should
take into account any special circumstances
which would have affected the purchaser's decision at the time, or any peculiar
predilections
to which the purchaser was subjectively prone.  To the extent
that a `subjective' approach on this issue would permit rescission
in a wider
range of circumstances than would otherwise be the case, I am inclined to think
that a `subjective' approach should be
preferred, having regard to the remedial
object of the legislation.  The legislative purpose is to make it unnecessary
for the purchaser
to check out any aspect of the information contained in the s
149 certificate which is annexed to the contract, including matters
which have
peculiar and unexpected importance to the purchaser.  However, it is not
necessary for me to decide the point in this
case.  Here there is no evidence
of special circumstances or other peculiarities affecting the position of the
purchaser at the time
of contract.  
<P>

67  	The relevant facts are that the Property was a warehouse and
office which would in all likelihood be deployed by the first
defendant to a
new use, through a lessee.  A development application would almost certainly be
needed, and possibly also a building
application.  The Council's policy in fact
applied to the Property, and raised the spectre of `deferred commencement
consent'.  The
policy implied that there was considerable uncertainty with
respect to government policy on aircraft flight paths at Kingsford Smith
Airport at the time, and that would have raised an apprehension in the first
defendant or in any reasonable purchaser that the application
of the policy
would be uncertain, conservative and slow.  Mr Reading's inquiries with Council
officers, and Mr Smyth's experience
in another matter, indicate that such
apprehension would at that time have had a reasonable basis.  I agree with Mr
Smyth that Council's
policy on aircraft noise would have raised a significant
doubt in the mind of a purchaser regarding what could and could not be done
on
the Property.  As earlier mentioned, I also agree with Mr Reilly, the first
defendant's valuer, that the policy would have had
a significant impact on the
value of the Property.  Taken together, these matters justify the conclusion
that the first defendant,
or any reasonable purchaser in its shoes, would not
have entered into the contract (that is, the contract in its very terms other
than the s 149 certificate, and at the price stated in the contract) had he or
she been aware of the existence of the policy.  I
so find.
<P>

68  	Mr Reading has given evidence that he had in mind the
installation of a mezzanine floor to provide office space.  Building
and
development of that kind would naturally have raised a greater risk of delay or
even refusal than a more orthodox application
(such as the development
application of 25 June 1997 for use for offset printing).  This evidence
reinforces the conclusion which
I have reached, but while I accept Mr Reading's
evidence, it is not necessary for me to rely on it.  It seems to me that any
reasonable
purchaser in his position, whether contemplating such a specific
development or not, would not have entered into the contract in
November 1996
if Council's policy as then administered had been known, and would have sought
to extract some concession in price
or in some other way.  
<P>

69  	The plaintiffs seek to attach significance to the fact that
after being informed of the contents of the second s 149 certificate
on or
about 13 January 1997, the first defendant made no inquiry as to the practical
effect of the Council's policy on aircraft noise
on the Property, other than to
speak to officers of the Council.  They seek to draw the inference that the
first defendant's decision
to rescind was motivated by factors other than the
aircraft noise policy, and accordingly that the first defendant's decision to
enter into the contract in the first place was made regardless of the existence
or absence of that policy.  In my opinion, for a
purchaser in the position of
the first defendant to rescind immediately upon receiving the new s 149
certificate would not imply
any collateral motive.  The purchaser was entitled
to take the view that a matter potentially significant to its use and enjoyment
of the Property had been misrepresented in breach of the statutory warranty,
and accordingly that it was entitled to rescind.  The
inquiries which Mr
Reading in fact made with the Council tended to support the view that the
policy may well have a significant impact
on any application with respect to
the Property.  Nothing in the evidence in this case leads me to believe that
the first defendant
was motivated by a collateral purpose.  I therefore reject
the inferences which the plaintiffs seek to draw.
<P>

70  	It follows, in my view, that the first defendant was entitled to
rescind the contract under clause 19 of the Regulation, and
it validly did so
on 21 January 1997.  Consequently the first defendant is entitled to be
refunded the deposit under clause 21 of
the Regulation.  However, argument was
also addressed to me on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55(2A)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, and I should I
express my view on the application of that provision.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55(2A)</a> states
that in every case where the Court refuses to grant specific performance of the
contract, or in any proceeding for the return
of a deposit, the Court may, if
it thinks fit, order the repayment of any deposit with or without interest
thereon.  The breadth
of the discretion has been emphasised in many cases:
see, in particular, <i>Lucas &amp; Tait (Investments) Pty Ltd v Victoria
Securities Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%202%20NSWLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 2 NSWLR 268</a>, 272-3;  <i>Wight v Foran </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20470" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11
NSWLR 470</a>, 482;  <i>SA Mearns v Parris Holdings Pty Ltd </i>(1994) 6 BPR
13,677, 13,685.  In the present case the cross-claim is a proceeding for the
return of the deposit.  Had I reached the
view that the first defendant did not
have a statutory entitlement to a refund of the deposit, I would have exercised
my discretion
to order repayment of the deposit under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55(2A).</a>  This is
because the contract in the present case was misleading because of the answer
to question 10 in the s 149 certificate which
was attached to it, and the
failure of the certificate to refer to the Council's policy on aircraft noise
which had been adopted
some months earlier.  The deficiency in the contract
would in all probability have been avoided if the vendors had obtained another
s 149 certificate closer to the time of the auction.  The first certificate was
dated 18 June 1996 and the property was sold at an
auction on 14 November 1996.
It was reasonable for the purchaser to rely on the certificate annexed to the
contract, given the statutory
support provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52A.</a>  It would not be
reasonable for the vendors to retain the deposit in circumstances where their
omission to update the s 149 certificate
before the auction caused the
purchaser to be misled with respect to the Council's policy on aircraft noise.
The present case bears
some analogy with the <i>Lucas &amp; Tait</i> case
itself, and I would have no hesitation in concluding for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
55(2A)</a> that in the circumstances it would be unjust and inequitable to permit
the plaintiffs to retain the deposit.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

71  	By attaching the s 149 Certificate to the contract, the
plaintiffs warranted that the certificate specified the true status
of the land
in relation to various matters, including that the Council had not by
resolution adopted any policy to restrict the development
of the land because
of the likelihood of land slip, bushfire, flooding, tidal inundation,
subsidence or any other risk.  That warranty
was untrue, because the Council
had adopted a policy on aircraft noise well before the date of the contract,
and that policy restricted
the development of the Property because of a
relevant risk. 
<P>

72  	The purchaser was therefore entitled to rescind the contract
under clause 19(3) of the Conveyancing (Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation</a>.  I have found
that the prerequisites for rescission under that clause were all met.  The
first defendant exercised this right of
rescission by notice in writing
properly served under clause 20 of the Regulation.  Consequently by clause 21
of the Regulation,
the contract was rescinded as from the time that it was
made, and the deposit of $46,000 which the purchaser paid under the contract
is
to be refunded to the purchaser under clause 21(1) of the Regulation.
<P>

73  	Consequently the plaintiffs are not entitled to any of the
relief which they have sought in the Summons, which should accordingly
be
dismissed.  The first defendant as cross-claimant is entitled to the
declarations sought in the first and second paragraphs of
the cross-claim,
namely declarations that the contract was validly rescinded and that it is
entitled to the return of the deposit.
 The alternative relief in paragraph 3
is not needed.
<P>

74  	Since the first defendant has been entitled to the refund of the
deposit at all material times from the date of the contract,
it is entitled to
recover any interest in fact earned on the deposit by the second defendant as
stakeholder, on ordinary restitutionary
principles.
<P>

75  	The first defendant as cross-claimant has also claimed an order
that the plaintiffs/cross-defendants pay its costs incurred
in preparing and
entering into the contract, investigating title and endeavouring to procure
good title.  In my opinion there is
no proper basis for this claim.  Clause 28
of the contract excludes vendor warranties other than the statutory warranties
with respect
to use of the Property and prevents the first defendant as
purchaser from making any claim for compensation or rescinding in respect
of
such matters.  Therefore as a matter of contract the first defendant had no
entitlement to rescind or claim compensation in respect
of the deficiency in
the first s 149 certificate.  The right to rescind arises only under the
statute.  Clause 21(3) of the Conveyancing
(Sale of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_reg/lr1995139/" class="autolink_findacts">Land) Regulation</a> states
that the rescission of the contract does not render the vendor liable to pay to
the purchaser any sum for damages, costs or
expenses.  However, clause 21(4)
states that sub-clause (3) does not affect any liability under the contract in
relation to payment
of damages, costs or expenses arising out of breach of a
term or condition of the contract.  In the present case, as I have mentioned,
the contract does not permit any claim for compensation to be made.  In my
opinion, therefore, the additional claim for relief in
the cross-claim
fails.
<P>

76  	On the questions of costs, I am strongly inclined to order that
the plaintiffs pay the first defendant's costs in all respects.
 The first
defendant's claim for compensation has failed but that claim was not
sufficiently significant to justify any qualification
of the order for costs.
However, I shall hear any further submissions which the parties may wish to
make on the question of costs
and the form of the orders.
