<b>JUDGMENT  (On application by defendant to tender of evidence from
plaintiff's affidavits in support of application for leave to amend:
T1038)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The defendant in its application for leave to amend has tendered
the following paragraphs of the following affidavits.
 The affidavit of Mr MBJ
Lee, 1 March 1999, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and the first sentence of paragraph 5
and annexures A and B; the
affidavit of Mr BJ Whittaker, 1 March 1999,
paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 and annexures B
and E; and
the whole of the affidavit of Mr W Flynn sworn 2 March 1999.
<P>

2	The affidavits were read by the plaintiff on that issue which resulted in my
delivery of the judgment on 19 March 1999, on the
plaintiff's notice of motion
to preclude inspection by the defendant of certain documents, which itself were
subject to an appeal
to the Court of Appeal which delivered a judgment on 15
April 1999.
<P>

3	The position now appears to be in relation to the defendant's application to
amend, that the plaintiff contends or will be contending,
prejudice with
respect to D18 to 25 and argues that, in the light of the generality of the
material the subject of the tender, it
is irrelevant.  The defendant submits
the relevance is to be to the question of prejudice, especially as to any
asserted need on
the part of the plaintiff for further investigation of
specific allegations and any lengthy adjournment required therefor.  The
material
is relevant also to the issue of the terms to be imposed on any grant
of leave and the reasonableness of any such terms.
<P>

4	The nub of the matter as arises from the material tendered, is that since the
"<i>Gruzovin"</i> allegations in December 1994 the plaintiff has taken steps,
through the resources of three firms of solicitors including his own
and the
barrister Mr Flynn, to gather evidence and prepare his position in relation to
anticipated criminal proceedings, police investigations,
the Royal Commission
and the two defamation actions.  That he has done so the tendered material
indicates with clarity.  He has done
so in the context of his position of
denial of allegations of sexual misconduct with underage males in a general
sense, and specifically
by asserting the falsity of all imputations hitherto
pleaded but now, more relevantly, those in fact found by the jury.
<P>

5	This appropriate conduct by and for the plaintiff over the last four to five
years is available to be relied upon, in my view,
to meet the assertion of
particular prejudice, and is clearly relevant to the issues enunciated by Mr
Nicholas QC. What inferences
can be drawn from those matters will be no doubt
raised in submissions.  What weight will be attached to them will also be a
matter
for submissions.
<P>

6	Equally, however, it must clearly be said that the ultimate admission of this
material cannot be taken in any way as circumventing
any existing privilege
that applies to documents or statements referred to in the respective
paragraphs of the affidavits.  Insofar
as formal objection was taken to
questions of form and hearsay, I apply <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 190(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> to
dispense with the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3.2</a> of the that Act, but for the purpose of
the determination of the tender only.  The tendered material is relevant,
notwithstanding
its generality, to the determination, by reference to the
conduct of the plaintiff by way of preparation of his position of denial
generally and the assertion of falsity of the found imputations, to the
question of prejudice in regard to D18 to D25, and the terms
and reasonableness
thereof of any grant of leave.
<P>

7	The paragraphs of the respective affidavits, to the tender of which objection
has been taken, are admitted.
