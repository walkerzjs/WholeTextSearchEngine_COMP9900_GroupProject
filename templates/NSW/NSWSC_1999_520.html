<b>L012/92	REGINA v Sam CONSTANTINOU</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:   This is an application by Sam Constantinou pursuant to
s13A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> that the Court set minimum terms and
additional terms to replace three sentences of imprisonment for life, which
were imposed on
the applicant by Lusher J on 24 September 1984, after the jury
in a trial conducted before Lusher J had found the applicant guilty
of the
murder of John Thomas Gibson at Marrickville on 14 October 1982, of the murder
of Leonard Herbert Carey at Camperdown on 26
November 1982 and of the murder of
Michael John Condon Brown at Lilyfield on 10 December 1982.  At the trial the
applicant was also
found guilty of four charges of robbery with striking and
wounding of four other victims, all of these offences having been committed
on
10 December 1982 and a charge of robbery with striking on 17 December 1982.
<P>

2	The applicant was tried jointly with a co-offender, Christopher
Hatziathanasiou, on the charges of murdering Mr Gibson and Mr
Brown.
Hatziathanasiou was found guilty on both charges of murder.  Hatziathanasiou
had pleaded guilty to four charges of robbery
with striking and wounding,
committed with the applicant.  Hatziathanasiou also pleaded guilty to nine
other charges of robbery with
striking and wounding, one charge of assault with
intent to rob with striking and wounding and one charge of robbery in
company.
<P>

3	The applicant did not dispute the statement of the facts of the cases of
murder contained in the notice filed by the Director
of Public Prosecutions
pursuant to Practice Note 57 and the following statement of the facts of the
offences and the course of the
criminal proceedings against the applicant is
taken from the notice filed by the Director and from the recorded interviews of
the
applicant on 9 and 10 January 1983.
<P>

	<b>Murder of Mr Gibson</b>
<P>

4	As I have already stated, the victim, John Thomas Gibson was murdered on 14
October 1982.  On the afternoon of 14 October 1982
the applicant met the
co-offenders Hatziathanasiou, a youth named Boland and a juvenile named
Vassilakis at a milk bar at Earlwood.
 The group discussed obtaining money for
the purchase of heroin by robbing some one.  The group travelled by bus to
Marrickville
Railway Station and then walked in the direction of Marrickville
R.S.L Club.  When questioned by police on 9 January 1983 the applicant
said,
"we were walking along the road... I saw an old bloke walking through the park
and Arthur (Boland) or George (Vassilakis),
I don't know who it was, said,
`there's a mug'".  I interpolate to say that I understand what was said to mean
that the old man,
who was Mr Gibson, was thought to be a suitable target for a
mugging.  Mr Gibson was seventy-two years old.  The applicant continued
in his
answers to the police as follows:-
<P>

	"We followed him across into the park and I pushed him to the ground and then
reached for his pockets... I got some money out of
his pockets, I think it was
two or three dollars".
<P>

5	The applicant, Hatziathanasiou and Vassilakis lifted the victim up and placed
him behind a park bench.  The four offenders then
left the park, having been
disturbed by passers by.  The offence was committed in daylight.
<P>

6	The post mortem examination of the deceased revealed extensive fractures of
the skull and nasal bones.  The cause of death was
found to be haemorrhages due
to the skull fractures.
<P>

7	When interviewed by the police, the applicant, while admitting that he had
pushed Mr Gibson over, denied that he had kicked Mr
Gibson.  
<P>

8	Vassilakis, who, as I have said, was a juvenile, had already been dealt with
for his part in this offence by the time of the applicant's
trial.  Boland, who
was tried at the same time as the applicant and Hatziathanasiou was found
guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Gibson.
<P>

9	In his remarks on sentence delivered on 24 September 1984 Lusher J simply
found:-
<P>

	"As he (Mr Gibson) walked through the park, Constantinou ran at him from
behind, pushed, shoved or held him to the ground, where
he was kicked,
robbed".
<P>

10	His Honour made no finding about who did the kicking.
<P>

	<b>Murder of Mr Carey</b>
<P>

11	Shortly after midnight on 25 November 1982 the applicant, who was alone, was
sitting on a bench at Annandale, when he observed
Mr Carey, who was sixty-five
years old, walking along Parramatta Road.  The applicant followed Mr Carey for
over 500 metres, until
he turned into a lane.  The applicant then ran up behind
Mr Carey, pushed him heavily in the back and punched him, causing him to
fall
to the ground.  As Mr Carey attempted to get up, the applicant punched him
about the head, until Mr Carey fell unconscious to
the ground.  While the
applicant was searching Mr Carey's pockets, he was disturbed by a barking dog.
The applicant took Mr Carey's
wallet, ran to a nearby street, extracted about
$50 in cash from the wallet and threw the wallet away.  
<P>

12	The pathologist who conducted the post mortem examination of the deceased
observed that Mr Carey had substantial abrasions and
brain injuries and formed
the opinions that the abrasions were consistent with blows from a fist and that
the brain injuries could
have been caused by the victim's head striking the
ground.
<P>

	<b>Robbery Offences</b>
<P>

13	Between 9.30 pm and 11.00 pm on 10 December 1982 the applicant and
Hatziathanasiou robbed four men in the Annandale/Glebe area.
 They used the
applicant's motor cycle as a means of transport.  Three of the victims were
elderly men and the other victim was a
man in his thirties.  Three of the
victims were assaulted and robbed by the applicant, while Hatziathanasiou kept
watch.  The other
victim was initially assaulted by the applicant but
Hatziathanasiou then kicked and robbed the victim.  All the victims suffered
head injuries of some kind.
<P>

	<b>Murder of Mr Brown</b>
<P>

14	The victim of the third murder, Mr Brown, was murdered later on the same
night, that is the night of 10 December 1982.  Shortly
after 11.00 pm the
applicant and Hatziathanasiou travelled on the applicant's motor cycle to a
part of Annandale.  There they kept
three elderly men, who were walking
together, under observation.  After the three men had separated, the applicant
and Hatziathanasiou
selected one of the men, Mr Brown, who was sixty-three
years old, as the target for a robbery.  The applicant and Hatziathanasiou
followed Mr Brown on foot for some distance.  Both the applicant and
Hatziathanasiou then ran up behind Mr Brown.  The applicant
pushed Mr Brown
heavily in the back and punched him in the head, causing him to fall face
forward to the roadway.  The applicant
and Hatziathanasiou moved Mr Brown to a
nearby street, searched his clothing and took about $80 from his pockets.
<P>

15	Mr Brown's body was later found, lying in a pool of blood.  A post mortem
examination of Mr Brown's body revealed extensive fractures
to his nose and
skull, which could have been caused by his face striking the roadway.  The
doctor who performed the post mortem examination
considered that the immediate
cause of death was the inhalation of blood from the nose and skull
fractures.
<P>

16	When interviewed by police on 9 January 1983, the applicant said, "I ran up
behind a man and I saw he did not have a wallet in
his hip pocket, so I hit him
from behind with my fist... he fell down on the road. I pinned him while he was
struggling and went
through his pockets".
<P>

	<b>Robbery with Striking</b>
<P>

17	The offence of robbery with striking was committed on 17 December 1982.  The
applicant followed the victim to his home.  When
the victim had arrived at his
front door, the applicant tapped him on the shoulder.  As the victim turned the
applicant punched him
on the jaw, rendering him unconscious.  The applicant
took $15 and a cigarette lighter from the victim.
<P>

18	The applicant was arrested on 9 January 1983 and has been continuously in
custody ever since.
<P>

19	In his summing-up to the jury at the trial the trial judge identified as the
act which on the Crown case caused the death of
each victim as being "the act
of running a man down from behind, in effect so that he does not see you and so
striking him and he
goes to the ground".  At the trial the Crown, under the
provisions of s18 of the <i>Crimes Act</i> as then in force, relied on two
heads of murder, contending that the act causing death was done in each case,
either with reckless
indifference to human life, that is with the knowledge
that it was probable that death would result, or during or immediately after
the commission of a crime punishable by death or penal servitude for life, such
as robbery with striking and wounding (that is felony
murder).  The Crown did
not allege that any of the accused had acted with an intention to kill or with
an intention to inflict grievous
bodily harm.  The trial judge also gave the
jury directions about common purpose, including a direction that an accused who
did not
himself do the act causing death would nevertheless be guilty of
murder, if that act was within his contemplation as an act which
might be done
in the course of carrying out a common purpose to which he was a party.
<P>

20	In his remarks on sentence Lusher J described the nature of the offences as
being "to select some elderly man, follow him and
then on getting close to him
to run fast at him from behind, either to push or hurl him to the ground and
then rob him".
<P>

21	In his remarks on sentence Lusher J did not make any finding about the basis
on which the applicant was to be regarded as having
murdered the victims.  In
my opinion, the applicant should be regarded in all cases as having committed
felony murder.  The case
against him that he had committed felony murder was
overwhelming.  On the other hand, it would, in my opinion, be difficult to be
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant foresaw that it was
probable that death would result from an act performed in
carrying out the
common purpose of robbery with striking.  Among other considerations the
applicant had committed a number of robberies
without a weapon but with
striking and wounding, where the death of the victim had not resulted.
<P>

22	In his remarks on sentence Lusher J referred to the applicant's subjective
circumstances.  The applicant was born on 1 April
1963.  His parents were Greek
Cypriots.  The applicant had convictions in the Children's Court and
convictions in 1982 but his Honour
stated that none of those offences had any
effect upon his Honour in dealing with the matters he was concerned with.  The
applicant
had had an unfortunate history at school and had been asked to leave
school, following an altercation with a teacher.  He had had
various jobs as a
bricklayer and labourer but had been dismissed on grounds of unsuitability,
poor attendance and suspected drug
use.
<P>

23	The applicant began taking drugs when he was eleven years old.  In his
teenage years he experimented with drugs and by the age
of eighteen he was
addicted to heroin.  Lusher J found that the applicant "presented as rebellious
and undisciplined with a lifestyle
that was irresponsible and without direction
and had descended to the pursuit of excitement and enjoyment through alcohol
and drug
abuse".
<P>

24	Lusher J after reviewing the subjective circumstances of the applicant and
Hatziathanasiou continued as follows:-
<P>

	"The whole picture presented by these two young men is, of course, a
devastating one.  It is sad and sickening to relate it. They
are both fine
looking, well built young men.  In another time and circumstances they would no
doubt have been fine young citizens".
<P>

25	At the time at which Lusher J sentenced the applicant and Hatziathanasiou,
the penalty for murder was imprisonment for life,
unless it appeared to the
sentencing judge that the prisoner's culpability was "significantly diminished
by mitigating circumstances".
 Lusher J found that there were no such
mitigating circumstances in the case of either the applicant or
Hatziathanasiou.  His Honour
then proceeded to sentence the applicant to penal
servitude for life on each of the three charges of murder and to concurrent
terms
of imprisonment for ten years on all the charges of robbery with striking
and wounding or with striking.  Hatziathanasiou was sentenced
to penal
servitude for life on each of the two charges of murder of which he had been
convicted and, with one immaterial exception,
to concurrent terms of
imprisonment for ten years on all of the charges of aggravated robbery.
<P>

26	As I have already stated, the applicant's application was made as long ago
as 26 July 1992.  A report of the Serious Offenders
Review Board concerning the
applicant was made on 11 November 1992.  I have read and have taken into
account this report and all
the annexures to the report.  The
summary-conclusion at the end of this report included the following:-
<P>

	"Until fairly recently Constantinou's gaol history has been unstable.  For a
long time there was no progress or any attempt on
the prisoner's part to come
to terms with his problems.  He must face these before he is to become an
acceptable member of the community
at large.  He has close family ties".
<P>

	*  *  *
<P>

<center>	"He has been a heroin addict, undisciplined and rebellious.  He is now
making good progress.  He still has to make more progress
but, if his present
behaviour continues to improve, hopes for the further down grading his security
and for preparing him in due
course to the community are real".</center>
<P>

27	Because of the long delay in the applicant's application coming before the
Court, a supplementary report of the Serious Offenders
Review Council
authenticated on 9 March 1999 was prepared.  I have read and have taken into
account this report and all the annexures
to this report.  At the end of the
report the Serious Offenders Review Council commented as follows:-
<P>

	"This supplementary report outlines Constantinou's progress in custody since
1994.  His admissions to the Special Care Unit and
the Violence Prevention
Programme are evidence of a willingness to address issues associated with his
criminal activity.  In spite
of his being the target of numerous allegations
there has been little concrete evidence to substantiate the suspicions of
authorities.
 There is support, however, for the view that he is manipulative
and that his motivations may be open to question".
<P>

28	Mr Saxby, the secretary of the Serious Offenders Management Committee, gave
brief evidence at the hearing of the application.
 Mr Saxby said that on 14
September 1998 the applicant's classification as a prisoner was reduced to C1
and it has remained at C1.
<P>

29	The applicant has been in custody in the Industrial Training Centre since
August 1998.  A memorandum from the Acting Governor
of the Industrial Training
Centre dated 5 May 1999 contained the following passages:-
<P>

	"(1)	In the period of time Sam Constantinou has been at the I.T.C he has
without doubt kept a low profile.  
<P>

	*  *  *
<P>

<center>	By and large... his conduct has been quite good both from an officer
and inmates' point of view.</center>
<P>

	(2)	Sam has completed the KAIROS course and has demonstrated a preparedness to
undertake personal development.  In many ways all
he has known since his late
teens is prison.  "Prison" has dictated much of his thinking and interaction
with officers, other inmates
and also those that visit him.  Understandably
this institutionalisation of Mr Constantinou has made it very difficult for him
to
learn the many coping mechanisms and behavioural models that most of us take
for granted.
<P>

	(3)	Consideration for a sentence determination at this time I feel is
appropriate and would give him an opportunity to be placed
on a programme that
would eventuate in his ultimate progression to a C3 classification.  That is
not saying that he, Constantinou,
will get it easy, without doubt this period
will be a difficult transitional stage and require a considerable amount of
counselling
and a preparedness to undertake personal development courses".
<P>

30	While in custody the applicant has in fact completed a number of courses,
including personal development courses.
<P>

31	No psychiatric or even psychological evidence about the applicant was placed
before me, even though some of the documents which
were admitted into evidence
disclose that he has been seen by psychologists while in the Industrial
Training Centre.  Senior counsel
for the applicant said that it was apparent
from the reports of the Serious Offenders Review Board and the Serious
Offenders Review
Council that the applicant had had his "ups and downs" within
the prison system and it had been considered by him that any further
material
would not be helpful to me.
<P>

32	The applicant gave evidence on the hearing of the application.  He said that
he was the eldest of the three children of Greek
Cypriot parents.  His mother,
sister and brother were in Court on the hearing of the application.  His father
is in Cyprus.  The
applicant gave evidence that in February 1999 he had married
within the prison system a young woman, whom he had known for twenty
years and
by whom he had had a child born in May 1995.  From soon after the applicant's
arrest and until he was sentenced, he was
in protective custody but the
applicant has not since been in protective custody.   The applicant said that
he would undertake the
considerable amount of counselling and the personal
development courses referred to in the memorandum of the Acting Governor of the
Industrial Training Centre.
<P>

33	According to a letter from the Department of Corrective Services, the
concurrent terms of penal servitude for ten years imposed
on the applicant for
the offences of aggravated robbery expired on 29 March 1989 and as at the date
of the hearing of this application
the applicant had served a period of ten
years one month eight days exclusively referable to the sentences for
murder.
<P>

34	As is usual, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions communicated
with the relatives of the deceased victims.  The
widow of Mr Brown replied,
opposing the granting of the present application.  
<P>

35	An application under s13A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> made by the
co-offender Christopher Hatziathanasiou on 1 April 1991 was heard and
determined by me in 1995.  I granted Hatziathanasiou's
application and set
minimum terms and additional terms to replace the original sentences of
imprisonment for life for the murders
of Mr Gibson and Mr Brown.  For each of
the two murders Hatziathanasiou was sentenced to a minimum term of penal
servitude of twenty
years commencing on 6 January 1983, being the date on which
Hatziathanasiou was first taken into custody, and expiring on 5 January
2003,
that being the earliest date on which he would be eligible for release on
parole, and an additional term of six years, the
sentences to be served
concurrently.  
<P>

36	No appeal was brought from my decision on Hatziathanasiou's application and
the redetermined sentences for Hatziathanasiou stand.
<P>

37	Because of parity arguments which have been advanced on the hearing of the
present application, it is important to note some
of the findings I made in
determining Hatziathanasiou's application.  Hatziathanasiou, of course, was not
involved at all in the
murder of Mr Carey.  As to the murders of Mr Gibson and
Mr Brown, I noted that at the trial the Crown had accepted that Hatziathanasiou
did not have an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm and I
found that he did not foresee that it was probable that
either victim would
die.  I found that the actual perpetrator of most, at least, of the physical
violence was Constantinou, and not
Hatziathanasiou.  I found that
Hatziathanasiou was to be regarded as being sentenced in each case, on the
basis that it was within
his contemplation that his co-offender Constantinou,
in carrying out the common purpose of robbing the victim with striking, would
do acts, which in fact caused the victim's death.  
<P>

38	Hatziathanasiou is about the same age as Constantinou;  he is in fact a few
months older, having been born in August 1962.  Unlike
the present applicant,
Hatziathanasiou had spent most of his sentence on protection, in more than
usually onerous conditions of imprisonment.
 In Hatziathanasiou's case I had
the advantage of a psychiatric report from Dr Westmore. I found that there were
some prospects of
rehabilitation for Hatziathanasiou.  
<P>

39	The applicant's application, having been made as long ago as July 1992, is
not subject to the amendments to s13A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> which came
into effect on 21 November 1993.  Under ss(4) of s13A the court may set a
minimum term and an additional term to replace
an original sentence of
imprisonment for life or decline to determine a minimum term and an additional
term.  Under ss(9) the court
is to have regard to:-
<P>

	"(a)	The knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to
imprisonment for life was eligible to be released
on licence under s463 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</i> 1900</a> and of the practice relating to the issue of such
licences; and
<P>

	(b)	Any report on the person made by the Serious Offenders Review Board and
any other relevant reports prepared after sentence
(including, for example,
reports on the person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made
available to the Supreme Court;
and
<P>

	(c)	Any relevant comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing
the sentence, 
<P>

	and may have regard to any other relevant matter".
<P>

40	I have already discussed and I have had regard to the reports of the Serious
Offenders Review Board and the Serious Offenders
Review Council and the remarks
on sentence of Lusher J.  I have also had regard to the matters referred to in
par(a) of ss(9).  
<P>

41	The principles to be applied by a court hearing an application under s13A of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> have been stated in a number of cases, some of which
are referred to in my judgment of 25 October 1995 in Hatziathanasiou's case.
Without attempting to state all of the relevant principles, I will simply note
some of them.
<P>

42	1.	The principles to be applied in sentencing for murder under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s19A</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></i> are generally applicable, except that a court on an
application under s13A is able to take into account all that has happened to
the applicant since he was originally sentenced.
<P>

43	2.	In general at least, an application under s13A should be refused, only if
the judge hearing the application considers that
a sentence of penal servitude
for life would be appropriate, that is only if the judge considers that the
case falls within the worst
category of cases of murder.  A case falling within
the worst category of cases is a case dealing with the worst type of offence
committed by the worst type of offender (<b>R v Boyd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2081%20A%20Crim%20R%20260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 81 A Crim R 260</a>
at 264).
<P>

44	(3)	A judge is prohibited from adopting a two tiered process of sentencing
and is required to draw together the relevant objective
and subjective
circumstances (<b>R v Twala </b>(unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 4 November
1994).  However, a judge is entitled to consider sequentially the arguments for
and
against a conclusion that the case before him is a case of the worst type
(<b>R v Garforth</b> (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 23 May 1994).
<P>

45	(4)	If a judge decides to set a minimum term, then in setting a minimum term
a judge fixes the minimum period which the prisoner
must serve in prison.  On
the expiration of the minimum term set by the judge the offender will be
eligible for release on parole
but he will not be entitled to be released on
parole unless a parole order is made by the Parole Board and the Board is not
to make
a parole order unless the Board has inter alia determined that the
release of the offender is appropriate, having regard to the principle
that the
public interest is of primary importance.
<P>

46	(5)	By virtue of the provisions of s13A(5) it is not possible to impose
cumulative sentences on an application under s13A.  Consequently,
where, as in
the present case, more than one sentence was imposed by the original sentencing
judge, then, if the application is granted,
the longest of the sentences
imposed by the judge hearing the s13A application must reflect the totality of
the criminality in all
of the offences committed by the offender, including the
offences for which determinate sentences were originally imposed.
<P>

47	At the hearing of this application senior counsel appearing for the Crown
opposed the application that I should set determinate
sentences to replace the
sentences of imprisonment for life originally imposed.  Counsel submitted that
the three murders which the
appellant had committed fell within the worst
category of cases of murder, for which the appropriate sentences would be
sentences
of imprisonment for the remainder of the offender's life.  Counsel
pointed to the facts that there were three murders, and not merely
one;  that
they were committed on separate occasions;  that two of the murders were
committed in company;  and that the applicant
and his co-offender were strong
young men and the victims were elderly, defenceless persons.
<P>

48	A submission was made on behalf of the Crown that I should find that the
applicant at least had the intention to inflict grievous
bodily harm on the
victims.  It was contended that it would have been apparent to the applicant
that it was unlikely that any of
the victims were carrying much money and that
I should not accept that the purpose of the assaults was to rob the victims, as
distinct
from injuring them.
<P>

49	However, at the trial the Crown did not contend that the applicant had the
intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm to any of
the victims and in his
remarks on sentence Lusher J found, notwithstanding the small, and even
trifling, amounts of money actually
taken from the victims, that the
applicant's motive in assaulting the victims was to obtain money for drugs.  In
these circumstances,
as in the case of Hatziathanasiou, I find that the
applicant had no intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on any of
the victims.
<P>

50	Senior counsel for the Crown accepted that the youth of an offender is a
relevant factor in sentencing and that the applicant
at the time of committing
the offences was only nineteen years old.  However, counsel pointed to recent
decisions of the Court of
Criminal Appeal <b>R v Leonard</b> (unreported Court
of Criminal Appeal 7 December 1998) and <b>R v Fernando</b> (unreported Court
of Criminal Appeal 14 April 1999), in which life sentences for murder imposed
on offenders only a few years older
than the applicant had not been disturbed
on appeal.
<P>

51	It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that, while it could be that the
applicant had some prospects of rehabilitation, the
existence of some prospects
of rehabilitation will not necessarily prevent a case falling within the worst
category of cases, for
which the only appropriate sentence is imprisonment for
life.  
<P>

52	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that it was of concern that there was
no psychiatric evidence about the applicant.  
<P>

53	It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the applicant's case could be
distinguished from Hatziathanasiou's case, in which
I had allowed the
application to set determinate sentences, on the basis that the applicant had
committed three murders, and not
two, and that the applicant had been the
perpetrator of most at least of the physical violence, Hatziathanasiou having
been treated
as criminally liable under the doctrine of common purpose.  
<P>

54	What was described as a "fall back" submission was made by the Crown that,
if the application was granted and determinate sentences
set, a very
substantial minimum term should be set with an additional term for life.
Reference was made by the Crown to <b>R v Rees</b> (unreported Court of
Criminal Appeal 23 September 1995 and <b>R v McCafferty</b> (unreported New
South Wales Supreme Court 15 October 1991), in both of which an application
under s13A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i> by an applicant who had committed three
murders was granted and determinate sentences set.
<P>

55	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that I should accept that all the
murders were felony murders, the applicant not having
intended to kill or to
inflict really serious bodily injury.  The murders had been committed on
separate occasions but, it was submitted,
during one period of criminality
extending over a couple of months.  The applicant was nineteen years old at the
time the offences
had been committed and has been continuously in custody since
he was nineteen.  It was submitted that the applicant has some prospects
of
rehabilitation and that the comment in the report of the Serious Offenders
Review Council and the remarks of the Acting Governor
of the Industrial
Training Centre were, to some extent at least, favourable to the applicant.
<P>

56	As to parity, it was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant that,
notwithstanding such differences as might exist between
their cases, the
applicant would have a legitimate sense of grievance, if, Hatziathanasiou's
application having been granted, the
applicant's application was refused.  It
was submitted that the applicant should receive a minimum term of the same
length as that
set for Hatziathanasiou and that, if there was to be any
difference in the sentences passed on the two offenders, that difference
should
be limited to a longer additional term in the case of the applicant.
<P>

57	It is clear that the objective circumstances of the crimes of murder were
very serious, for the reasons given by the Crown. 
<P>

58	I am satisfied that the applicant's case is worse that Hatiathanasiou's
case.  The applicant was convicted of three murders;
 Hatziathanasiou was
convicted of two murders.  The additional murder more than offsets the
additional offences of aggravated robbery
to which Hatziathanasiou pleaded
guilty.  The applicant was the perpetrator of at least most of the physical
violence to which the
victims were subjected, whereas Hatziathanasiou was dealt
with on the basis that he was liable under the doctrine of common purpose.
Hatziathanasiou had spent most of his sentence on protection, in more than
usually onerous conditions of imprisonment, whereas the
applicant, apart from a
period between being arrested and sentenced, has not been on protection.  In
Hatziathanasiou's case there
was some psychiatric evidence;  in the applicant's
case there is no psychiatric evidence.  Accordingly, as the applicant's case is
worse than Hatziathanasiou's case, the applicant should be dealt with more
severely than Hatziathanasiou.  
<P>

59	The question for decision is whether, in accordance with the Crown's primary
submission, the applicant's application should be
refused, on the ground that
the case falls within the worst category of cases of murder involving offences
of the worst type.
<P>

60	I have concluded, after anxious consideration, that I should grant the
application.  I am aware of the need to avoid a two tiered
process of
sentencing but I should indicate the factors which have led me to my
conclusion.
<P>

61	In my opinion, notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal
in <b>R v Mills</b> (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 3 April 1995) it is a
mitigating factor, even if only slight, that in no case did the applicant
intend to kill or to inflict really serious bodily injury or foresee the
probability of death.
<P>

62	The offences were committed when the applicant was nineteen years old and he
has been in gaol since he was nineteen.  His youth
is relevant, both because of
his immaturity at the time of committing the offences and the severity to him
of a sentence for the
rest of his life.  If the applicant is to serve a life
sentence, he could spend upwards of fifty years or more in prison.  I
appreciate
that in a proper case a judge is required to impose a life sentence
on an offender as young as the applicant, however severe the
impact of the
sentence on the offender.  However, the youth of the applicant at the time of
committing the offences and at the time
of entering into custody is a matter I
should take into account.
<P>

63	I find that the applicant has some prospects of rehabilitation and the
memorandum by the Acting Governor of the Industrial Training
Centre offers some
encouragement.
<P>

64	In my opinion, there is some force in the argument based on parity.
Hatziathanasiou's application was granted and under the determinate
sentences
set Hatziathanasiou is eligible for release on parole in January 2003, when he
will be forty years old, and he will be
entitled to be released no later than
January 2009, when he will be forty-six years old and, if not earlier released,
would have
served twenty-six years in gaol.  Even though there are differences,
and important differences, between the cases of Hatziathanasiou
and the
applicant, which should be reflected in the applicant receiving severer
sentences, I have concluded that the differences
are not such as to warrant a
situation where Hatziathanasiou will be released from custody at some stage in
his forties, while the
applicant will be kept in custody, with no prospect of
ever being released, even if he lives to the age of sixty or seventy or more.
As noted by the Crown, there have been cases in which applications by triple
murderers have been granted.  See <b>McCafferty </b>and <b>Rees</b>.
<P>

65	In setting a minimum term I take into account inter alia that in setting a
minimum term I am fixing the minimum term of imprisonment
which the applicant
must serve before becoming eligible for release on parole and that whether, and
when, the applicant will be released
on parole depends on the Parole Board
deciding that it should make a parole order.  In all the circumstances,
including that it was
the applicant who was the perpetrator of at least most of
the violence to which the victims were subjected, I should set an additional
term for the remainder of the applicant's life.
<P>

66	I have concluded, taking into account the objective facts of the murders,
the facts of the offences of robbery and the sentences
imposed for them, the
subjective circumstances of the applicant before and after he was sentenced,
the terms of s13A including the
matters I am required to take into account, and
the principles of sentencing which I have stated or referred to, I should
impose
the following sentences.
<P>

67	Mr Constantinou for each of the murders of John Thomas Gibson, Leonard
Herbert Carey and Michael John Condon Brown, I sentence
you to a minimum term
of penal servitude of thirty years commencing on 9 January 1983 and expiring on
8 January 2013, that being
the earliest date on which you will be eligible for
release on parole and an additional term for the remainder of your life, the
sentences to be served concurrently.
<P>
