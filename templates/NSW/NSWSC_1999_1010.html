BYRNE</u></b>
<P>

<b><u> </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  The plaintiff, McIver Transport Pty
Limited, by summons filed on 9 July 1999 sought orders, firstly, that
proceedings number 5277/98
pending in the Local Court at Sydney be transferred
to this Court and, secondly, an order that those proceedings be then
transferred
to the Supreme Court of Queensland.
<P>

2   	It was the plaintiff's submission that power to transfer
the proceedings from the Local Court to this Court was to be found
in s 8(1) of
the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act</a></b> (1987).
<P>

3   	By agreement dated 14 May 1997 the defendant agreed to
design, manufacture and sell to the plaintiff and the plaintiff agreed
to buy
twenty-one trailers and four dollies in accordance with specifications set out
in a schedule.  The defendant agreed to manufacture
the equipment in accordance
with designs approved by Road User Research Pty Limited.  The trailers and
dollies were to be delivered
to the plaintiff in accordance with a schedule
which set out staged delivery dates.  The final delivery, being a consignment
of four
A trailers and two B trailers and one dolly (collectively described as
an Icon unit) was to be effected on or before 1 March 1998.
 Delivery was to be
at the plaintiff's premises in Cloncurry, Queensland.  The defendant is a
resident of New South Wales.  The trailers
and dollies were manufactured at the
defendant's premises in Wagga Wagga. The plaintiff is a resident of Queensland.
The agreement
was expressed to be governed by the law of Queensland.
<P>

4   	In early April of 1998 it appears that there was some
reluctance on the part of plaintiff to accept delivery of the final Icon
unit.
Prior to that time modifications had been carried out by the defendant to items
of equipment delivered under the agreement.
 In particular, the trailer bins
required modification.  The plaintiff contended that they were subject to
cracking and warping.
 The process of strengthening the bins was said to have
led to a reduction in their capacity.  
<P>

5   	The plaintiff required the Icon units for the purpose of
hauling lead and zinc from the BHP Cannington mine to a rail head
at
Cloncurry.
<P>

6   	By letter dated 17 April 1998 the defendant's solicitors
wrote to the plaintiff demanding payment of the purchase price of
the final
Icon unit.  By summons filed on 18 April 1998 in the Commercial Division of
this Court the defendant claimed damages or,
alternatively, an order for
specific performance.  The defendant pleaded that the agreed purchase  price
was $575,382.
<P>

7   	On 8 May 1998 the parties handed up to the court a document
headed Terms of Interim Settlement.  The parties' agreement was
that the
plaintiff would take delivery of the final Icon unit and pay to the defendants
the sum of $575,382.  The plaintiff further
agreed to pay to the defendants the
sum of $2,181 being the balance of certain invoices referred to in a schedule.
The defendants
specifically reserved their rights to pursue claims in relation
to two invoices numbered 102251 and 102378.  The plaintiff reserved
its rights
as against the defendants.
<P>

8   	As at the date of the settlement of the proceedings no
defence had been filed.  It is clear that the plaintiff, at a meeting
between
the parties and their solicitors on 22 April 1998, had made reference to a
claim against the defendants for breach of contract,
negligence and breaches of
the relevant provisions of the<b> Sale of Goods Act (Qld)</b>.  The reservation
of plaintiff's rights should be viewed in the light of that history.
<P>

9   	The proceedings came on before Giles J on 22 May 1998. The
terms of interim settlement had earlier been handed up but there
had been no
agreement how the proceedings might be finally disposed of.  His Honour heard
evidence going to that issue and submissions
on 22 May. His Honour noted that
the defendants had, by the terms of the interim settlement, obtained the
substance of that which
they had claimed in their summons.  His formal order
was that the summons be dismissed but that the plaintiff (the defendant in the
subject proceedings) pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

10   	Prior to the final disposal of the proceedings before
Giles J, but after the terms of settlement had been handed up, and consistent
with the reservation of their rights in relation to the two invoices, the
defendant commenced proceedings in the Local Court by statement
of liquidated
claim seeking payment of two sums of $16,200 relating to invoices numbered
102251 and 102378 together with the sum
of $2,181.  The plaintiff had agreed to
pay the latter sum in the agreement of 24 April 1998 which led to the
settlement of the proceedings
in the Commercial Division.  It appears that the
principal was paid consistent with that agreement, but that as at the date of
filing
in the Local Court the outstanding amount of $2,181 had not been paid.
Subsequently, it appears that sum was paid and that which
remains in issue in
the Local Court is the sum of $34,400.  It is alleged that that sum represents
the agreed costs of carrying out
modifications to sixteen trailer tubs.  The
modifications were carried out in two batches and it is contended by the
defendants that
on or about 31 March 1998 the plaintiff agreed that the sum of
$16,200 was a fair price in respect of the modifications of eight
of the
trailers.  In the event it is contended identical modifications were carried
out to sixteen trailers.
<P>

11   	After the commencement of the proceedings in the Local
Court, by writ issued on 16 June 1998 the plaintiff commenced proceedings
in
the Supreme Court of Queensland by Statement of Claim against the defendants
seeking damages for breach of the contract entered
into on 14 May 1997.  The
plaintiff claimed a breach of an implied term in that agreement that the design
and manufacture of the
Icon units would be carried out with due  care and
skill.  It was further pleaded that the units were not of merchantable quality
nor fit for the purpose for which they were supplied.  It was also pleaded that
the defendants had been negligent in the design and
manufacture of the units.

<P>

12   	The defendants applied to have the Queensland proceedings
stayed upon the basis that the plaintiff could have asserted its
claims by way
of defence or cross-claim in the proceedings before the Commercial Division of
this Court.
<P>

13   	The defendants relied on the authority of<b> Port of
Melbourne v Anshun Pty Ltd (No 2)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589.</a>  Atkinson J dismissed
the defendant's application.  She found that there was no possibility that the
Queensland proceedings would
give rise to conflicting judgments.  Her Honour
noted that there had been no adjudication on the merits.  She further found it
had
not been unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have raised its present
claim by way of defence or cross-claim in the New South Wales
proceedings.  In
that regard her Honour reviewed the authorities and concluded that there is no
necessity for a party sued for the
price of goods to set up in those
proceedings a claim by way of breach of warranty or lose the opportunity to
subsequently assert
such a claim.
<P>

14   	On 11 June 1998 the plaintiff filed a notice of grounds of
defence in the Local Court proceedings.  The plaintiff did not
in that defence
plead the matters which form the basis of its claim in the Queensland
proceedings.
<P>

15   	On 19 June 1998 the plaintiff prepared a Notice of Motion
in the Local Court proceedings seeking to have those proceedings
stayed pending
the determination of the Queensland proceedings.  Craig McIver, the plaintiff's
solicitor, swore an affidavit on 17
June 1998 setting out the basis upon which
the application for a stay was made.  It was contended that the Local Court in
Sydney
was not an appropriate Court in which to deal with the issues raised by
the defendant's Statement of Claim because there was insufficient
connection
with the Local Court district.  Further, the plaintiff submitted that it wished
to raise a counter-claim which exceeded
the jurisdictional limit of the Local
Court.  The Queensland Supreme Court was suggested to be the more appropriate
court in which
to deal with the matter.  Finally, it was asserted that the
Queensland proceedings involved the same facts and circumstances as the
Local
Court proceedings.
<P>

16   	The application for a stay pursuant to s 20(3) of the
<b>Service and Execution of Process Act</b> came on before Magistrate O'Shane
on 15 January 1999.  Her Worship refused the application.  It appears that
following that refusal
the plaintiff sought to appeal against her Worship's
determination.  The affidavit of Meredith Louise Cridland, a solicitor in the
employ of the plaintiff's solicitors, sets out the history of the purported
appeal.  Apparently there was some difficulty in obtaining
a copy of her
Worship's reasons and an extension of time in which to lodge the appeal was
sought.  In the meantime, amendments to
Pt 5 of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> </b>(1902)
came into effect.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff commenced proceedings by way of appeal
against Magistrate O'Shane's determination of 15 January 1999 in conformity
with the procedures set out in Pt 51B of the Supreme Court Rules pursuant to
the newly inserted provisions of Pt 5 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> 1902.  Those
provisions govern appeals from the Local Court arising out of determinations on
or after 1 March 1999.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff's summons came on before Adams J on 12 April
1999.  His Honour was constrained to dismiss the proceedings, taking
the view
that they were misconceived.  It was after that determination that the
plaintiff commenced the present proceedings seeking
orders under the<b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act</a></b>.
<P>

19   	The matter came before me for hearing on 20 August 1999.
The proposed transfer of the Local Court proceedings to this Court
and the
further transfer of those proceedings to the Queensland Supreme Court was
opposed by the defendants. Mr Aitken, who appeared
for the defendants,
submitted that the Local Court proceedings had been commenced well over a year
ago and it was likely they might
be disposed of in the near future.  It was Mr
Aitken's submission that the Local Court proceedings are a discrete claim and
that
his clients ought not be denied the opportunity to have it heard promptly.
In particular, Mr Aitken placed emphasis on the fact that
the plaintiff's
defence did not in terms raise the matters the subject of the Queensland
proceedings.
<P>

20   	Mr Parker, who appeared for the plaintiff, conceded that
to be the case.  Mr Parker sought an adjournment to obtain instructions
as to
whether the plaintiff wished to seek leave to amend its defence in the Local
Court or to raise by way of cross claim the matters
raised in the Queensland
proceedings.
<P>

21   	The application was stood over for further hearing to
today.  When it came on this afternoon Mr Parker sought leave to file
an
amended summons together with an affidavit of his solicitor, Mr McIver,
annexing thereto a draft of a proposed cross-claim.  Leave
was granted to file
the amended summons. By that summons the plaintiff claims, firstly, an order
that proceeding No 5277/98 pending
in the Local Court at Sydney be transferred
to this Court.  Secondly, leave to file the cross-claim, being Annexure A to
the affidavit
of Craig Douglas McIver, sworn on 24 August 1999, in the
proceedings so transferred.  Thirdly, an order that the proceedings so
transferred
be then transferred from this Court to the Supreme Court of
Queensland.
<P>

22   	Mr Aitken relied on a further affidavit of Warwick
Archibald Colbron sworn on this date.  That sets out something of the progress
of the Local Court proceedings over the past week.  Relevantly, it establishes
that no application has to date been made in the Local
Court to file an amended
defence.  Further, that at a call-over on 23 August 1999 Mr Hield, appearing
for the plaintiff, provided
an estimate to the court that the hearing would
take between one-half day to one day.  The matter has been stood over to 1
September
1999.  The Registrar has indicated that the proceedings may be heard
in the week commencing 22 November 1999.
<P>

23   	Mr Aitken opposes the making of the orders sought in the
amended summons.  Again, he relies on the circumstance that the proceedings
were commenced in the  Local Court in May 1998.  It is submitted that his
clients ought not be denied the opportunity to have their
claim resolved
promptly.  On the last occasion Mr Aitken drew my attention to the circumstance
that Road User Research Pty Limited
had been joined as a defendant in the
Queensland proceedings.  It was Mr Aitken's submission that the Queensland
proceedings were
likely to be lengthy and to raise issues quite outside the
scope of the Local Court proceedings.
<P>

24   	On the face of things, the proceedings in the Local Court
are wholly distinct in the sense that they raise discrete legal
and factual
issues when viewed in comparison with the claims advanced in the Queensland
proceedings.
<P>

25   	Mr Parker accepts, in a sense, that this is so, but
submits that the proper approach is for the Court, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8(1)(b)(ii)</a> of
the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act</a></b>, to transfer the
proceedings to this Court and give leave to file the cross-claim.
<P>

26   	It is Mr Parker's submission that there is a real area of
factual overlap and that proceeding in this way would enable all
issues to be
efficiently disposed of by the one Court.  In that respect Mr Parker places
reliance on the observations of Rogers J
in<b> Bankinvest AG v Seabrook
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 711</a> at 725:
<P>

"It is important that full effect be given by the courts to the imaginative and
detailed code for ensuring that throughout Australia
disputes are dealt with by
the one court and that be the court most appropriate for the particular
dispute."
<P>

27   	The power of this Court to transfer proceedings pending in
another court in this jurisdiction in order that they might be
transferred to
the Supreme Court of another State is discussed by Austin J in <b>Heath Group
Australasia v Hanning</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/719.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 719.</a> That case involved an application
to remove proceedings from the Chief Industrial Magistrate to this Court in
order that those proceedings
might be heard together with related proceedings
transferred to this Court from the Federal Court.  His Honour held that by
reference
to the powers under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss8(1)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">5</a>(1) of the Act "the Supreme Court may
remove a proceeding from another court of the State so that it becomes a
proceeding of the Supreme
Court, in order to transfer the proceeding to the
Federal Court".	
<P>

28   	I accept his Honour's analysis and consider that I have
the power to transfer the Local Court proceedings to this Court with
a view to
the transfer of them to the Supreme Court of Queensland.
<P>

29   	The issue that arises for my determination, consistent
with the observations of Rogers J in<b> Bankinvest,</b> is a consideration of
where the interests of justice lie.  
<P>

30   	I note, having regard to the  pleadings in the Local Court
which were completed by the filing of a notice of grounds of defence
in June of
1998, that the legal issues raised are discrete.  They do not seem to me to
overlap with the issues raised in the plaintiff's
Statement of Claim in the
Queensland proceedings.
<P>

31   	The factual issues, having regard to the pleadings, do not
involve a large measure of overlap, although I accept Mr Parker's
submission
that the witnesses are likely to be the same.  
<P>

32   	As noted, the defendants oppose the making of the orders
sought. The fact that both parties do not consent to a transfer of
proceedings
under the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act</a></b> is by no means
determinative, but it is a matter to be taken into account.  However, the
critical issue remains a consideration of
where the interests of justice
lie.
<P>

33   	I place more significance on the fact that the defendants
moved promptly to commence proceedings in the Local Court.  Those
proceedings
involve a limited and distinct issue which, on the evidence, is likely to be
resolved in a hearing occupying not more
than one day at the Local Court.
<P>

34   	The plaintiff has delayed in bringing the present
application.  The reasons for that may be explained having regard to the
application for a stay and the abortive appeal.  Nonetheless there has been
delay and it has the effect of putting off the defendants'
claim.
<P>

35   	I consider, on balance, that the interests of justice do
not favour the making of the orders sought by the plaintiff and,
accordingly, I
propose to dismiss the amended summons.  
<P>

36   	On the matter of costs I note that on the last occasion,
that is on 20 August 1999, I made an order that the plaintiff pay
the
defendant's costs of that day.  I was proposing making an order simply in terms
that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs
of these proceedings.  To that Mr
Parker makes two submissions.  Firstly, he observes that on the last occasion
the issue of my power
to transfer the Local Court proceedings to this Court was
contested.  He says that since I am of the view that I have the power,
I ought
structure the costs order to take into account time taken up in consideration
of this aspect. 
<P>

37   	Secondly, Mr Parker points to the circumstance that a
Notice of Motion was filed by the defendants seeking to have these proceedings
struck out as an abuse of process.  Though I have not granted the relief Mr
Parker seeks he submits that there was no basis for an
application of that
sort.  
<P>

38   	The basis for Mr Aitken's submission that I did not have
the power to transfer the Local Court proceedings to this Court related
to a
contention as to the relationship between the<b> Service and Execution of
Process Act</b> (1992) and the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/joca427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting)
<A HREF="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/">Act</a></b>1987</A> (NSW).  Had I been minded to grant the plaintiff the relief it
seeks, Mr Aitken would have sought an adjournment in order to serve
notices
pursuant to s 78B of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/">Judiciary Act </b>1903</A> (Cth) in order to ventilate
that matter.  In the event, that was not necessary.  I do not consider the way
the proceedings were 
developed before me that it is appropriate to structure
the order for costs to take account of the submission by Mr Aitken that I
did
not have the power to grant the relief that the plaintiff seeks.  
<P>

39   	Accordingly, my order is that the plaintiff pay the
defendant's costs of the proceedings.  That order does not include any
costs
incurred in relation to the defendant's motion but it seems to me, on such
material as is available, that the proceedings,
when they first came before
Grove J, being the summons proceeding, went over in what I would describe as
the ordinary course.  The
defendant is entitled to his costs of the
proceedings.  The only item excluded is the preparation of the Notice of
Motion.
