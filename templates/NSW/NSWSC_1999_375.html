<center><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  In these proceedings as presently constituted, the
Plaintiff sues the First Defendant, a company incorporated in New South Wales,
in contract and the Second Defendant, a company incorporated and carrying on
business in New Zealand and not in New South Wales,
in tort.  It seems that it
was with a view to fulfilling the First Defendant's obligations under its
contract with the Plaintiff
that the Second Defendant was engaged in the
packing in New Zealand of a printing press for dispatch to Holland.  The claim
of the
Plaintiff against the Second Defendant was that it was negligent in
about the execution of that activity.
<P>

2	In Reasons delivered by me on 17 March last I indicated that the Second
Defendant was entitled to succeed in an application the
result of which would
be to prevent the Plaintiff pursuing the Second Defendant in this court.  Inter
alia, I held that a New Zealand
statute had the effect of precluding the claim
brought against the Second Defendant and that this court was a clearly
inappropriate
forum for the resolution of issues involving the Second
Defendant, a fortiori if account was taken of the likelihood that, absent
some
restriction imposed by the Court, another New Zealand organisation, Ryder's
Customs Agency Ltd would be also joined.  Evidence
from the solicitor for the
First Defendant indicated she had instructions to cross claim against the First
Defendant and Ryder's.
<P>

3	(In re-reading the Reasons given by me on 17 March, I observe that on two
occasions the word "inconvenient" mistakenly appears
instead of
"inappropriate".  These instances are in the last line of paragraph 38 and the
second, but not the seventh, line of paragraph
39.  So far as the first of
these is concerned, as recorded in paragraphs 16 and 28, the parties had agreed
that "clearly inappropriate"
was the test.  So far as the second is concerned,
my conclusion is stated correctly at the beginning of paragraph 43.)
<P>

4	I left outstanding the manner by which my conclusions should be given effect.
On 26 March last that matter was the subject of
argument and it is to that
manner that these Reasons are directed.  Obviously also relevant to my
conclusions are the earlier Reasons
but it is unnecessary that I repeat at
length matters referred to therein.  It will be convenient hereafter to refer
to the First
and Second Defendants by the names used in my earlier Reasons,
"Bollinger" and "Pope" respectively.
<P>

5	On 26 March, the Plaintiff sought that I make orders:-
<P>

	"1.  That leave for the Plaintiff to proceed against the Second Defendant be
refused.
<P>

	2.  That so much of the Statement of Claim as constitutes a claim against the
Second Defendant be set aside.
<P>

	3.  That the Plaintiff file and serve an Amended Statement of Claim on or
before 12 April 1999.
<P>

	4.  That the First Defendant file and serve an Amended Defence on or before
May 1999.
<P>

	5.  That the Plaintiff pay the Second Defendant's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

	6.  That there be no order as to the First Defendant's costs of the Second
Defendant's Notice of Motion.
<P>

	7.  That the matter be stood over for further directions on 7 May 1999.
<P>

6	I did not understand the Plaintiff's pursuit of those orders as a withdrawal
of the stance it had adopted originally and which
in my earlier Reasons I had
rejected.  The orders proposed were directed, as I understood them, to
implementing the decisions previously
made.
<P>

7	A draft of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim was provided.  Apart from
making apparent that somewhat more attention has
been paid to the precise
formulation of the Plaintiff's claim against Bollinger, the document omits the
earlier claim that Bollinger
had agreed to ship a printing press from premises
at Auckland in New Zealand, retaining merely the claim that Bollinger had
agreed
to arrange for the shipment of that printing press.
<P>

8	Bollinger's preferred position in light of the decisions at which I have
arrived was that I should stay the whole of the proceedings.
 Its fall-back
position was that I should make the orders sought by the Plaintiff.  Unless the
order took the form of staying the
whole proceedings, Bollinger opposed the
making of any order which had the effect of staying, in advance of it being
made, any cross-claim
by Bollinger against Pope.  (Such a cross-claim is out of
time.  Bollinger would need Pope's consent or an extension of time to make
it.)
<P>

9	Counsel appearing for Pope indicated that his client was content that the
Short Minutes of Order advanced by the Plaintiff reflected
the Reasons
previously given.  However, his client's preferred position was that all
proceedings should be stayed and if not, in
addition to the orders sought in
the Short Minutes of Order there should be a stay of any cross-claim by
Bollinger against Pope.
<P>

10	The hearing on 26 March proceeded on the basis of Bollinger's original
Notice of Motion of 8 December 1997.  Given the circumstances
in which the
matter again came before me and the width of that notice of motion, I do not
see any formal restriction on any party
seeking the orders it did.  No further
evidence was put before me although there was a suggestion that, recently,
there has been
some movement in the New Zealand proceedings referred to in
paragraph 8 of my earlier Reasons.  The parties agreed that if it seemed
to me
that the present state of those proceedings was relevant to my conclusion I
would advise them before giving judgment.
<P>

11	I was informed from the bar table by counsel appearing for the Plaintiff
that his client has not sued Bollinger elsewhere - a
fact I would infer from
the evidence which was originally tendered.  I was also informed that the
Plaintiff does not propose to sue
Bollinger other than in New South Wales or to
sue anyone else in New Zealand.  Had I seen the Plaintiff's intentions in that
regard
as of importance, I would have afforded the Plaintiff an opportunity to
place the matter on affidavit because the argument as to
the form of order
which should be made was brought on at fairly short notice.  However, while it
would be clearly relevant to my
decision to know that the Plaintiff intended to
litigate the issues raised in the current proceedings in some other
jurisdiction,
it does not seem to me that the Plaintiff's intentions as
outlined are of any significant weight.  Such intentions are liable to
ready
change, particularly in response to changes in circumstances.  If the Plaintiff
is precluded from suing Bollinger here it may
well decide to sue Bollinger in
New Zealand rather than give up its claim entirely.
<P>

12	The solicitor for Bollinger in the New South Wales proceedings said that she
had instructions to cross-claim against Pope and
to join Ryder's and although,
again, instructions may change, the circumstances as they have been revealed in
the proceedings before
me make that course inherently likely.  This, together
with the fact that Bollinger has already commenced proceedings against Ryder's
and Pope in New Zealand leads me to conclude that the strong probability is
that, unless the New South Wales proceedings are stayed,
a significant number
of issues will be litigated in both New South Wales and New Zealand.  (Of
course one must recognise that, one
or more aspects of the dispute may be
settled, but there was no evidence to suggest this was more or less likely than
one might expect
from the nature of the litigation.)
<P>

13	It is unnecessary to repeat the views expressed in my Reasons of 17 March.
The question is whether New South Wales is a clearly
inappropriate forum for
the litigation.  In this respect I should have regard to the whole of the
controversy represented by or involving
the litigation the court is asked to
stay - see <b>Societe ationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20AC%20871" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) AC 871</a> at 900-1, <b>Hi-Fert v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/1914.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 1914</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2071%20FCR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 71
FCR 172</a> at 185 (RSH CHECK subsequently overruled on another point), <b>CSR Ltd
v Cigna Insurance Ltd </b>(1996-7) 189 CLR 345 at 400-1.  In light of the
conclusions expressed in paragraph 11, I take account of Bollinger's
anticipated cross-claim.
<P>

14	It must be recognised that at this stage the Plaintiff wishes to sue only
Bollinger and that, as between these parties, the litigation
has substantial
connection with New South Wales.  Some aspects of this are referred to in my
earlier reasons particularly in paragraphs
7 and 28 and in paragraph 10 of
these Reasons.  In addition, Mr Meagher SC, appearing for the Plaintiff,
pointed out that Bollinger's
performance under its contract with the Plaintiff
occurred or was likely to have occurred in New South Wales and no questions of
New Zealand law were raised by the Plaintiff's claim.  Mr Meagher pointed out
also that there were likely to be significantly different
issues in the
Plaintiff's claim against Bollinger compared with Bollinger's claim against
Pope or against Ryder's.
<P>

15	I acknowledge that all of these matters are entitled to weight.  I
acknowledge also that it is not a case of looking at the situation
as between
Bollinger and Pope and, having come to a conclusion as to that, using  that
conclusion in deciding whether New South Wales
is a clearly inappropriate forum
so far as the balance or totality of the action is concerned.  Rather should
all of what may be
called the primary factors be considered together.
<P>

16	Nevertheless, the conclusion at which I have arrived is that New South Wales
is a clearly inappropriate forum for the determination
of the dispute.  Most of
the matters arguing in that direction are referred to in my earlier Reasons.  I
should add however reference
to the fact that if the Plaintiff is allowed to
continue its action here and Pope is not a party, Bollinger almost certainly
will
be obliged to call witnesses from Pope if Bollinger is to have any hope of
disputing many of the Plaintiff's allegations.  While
Bollinger and Pope have a
common interest in resisting the Plaintiff's claim, one must recognise also
that their interests are in
some respects in conflict.  I think I may take note
of the fact that there is commonly a practical difficulty in such a situation
of obtaining co-operation of witnesses resident in another jurisdiction.
<P>

17	Although I do not need to rely on the fact, it seems to me not irrelevant
also that, notwithstanding the substantial New South
Wales connection to which
Mr Meagher drew attention, at all times the Plaintiff knew that the packing and
shipment of the printing
press would have to be effected in New Zealand.  The
fact that Bollinger is located in New South Wales and not in New Zealand is
not
conclusive against the application - <b>Sedgwick Ltd v Bain Clarkson Ltd</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1193.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1193</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20129%20ALR%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 129 ALR 493</a> 
<P>

18	The more limited formulation of its claim in the proposed Amended Statement
of Claim may well have had an impact on the issues
and number of witnesses
involved in the dispute between the Plaintiff and Bollinger but it was not
suggested that, if the overall
dispute is considered, this would be
significant.
<P>

19	It was at one stage suggested that Bollinger's claim against the other
parties was limited to $13,500.00, a figure mentioned
in the New Zealand
proceedings Bollinger has commenced, and so removed from the amount of the
Plaintiff's claim as to indicate little
likelihood of any claim by Bollinger
resulting in significant dispute.  However, I am satisfied that Bollinger has,
and wishes to
pursue, in addition to the claim for $13,500.00, a claim for the
consequential losses the Plaintiff seeks against it.  A loss adjuster's
report
attached to the affidavit of the Solicitor for the Plaintiff of 22 April 1998
indicates these consequential losses are in
the sum of NLG$330,000.  I think I
may take judicial notice of the fact that one NLG is worth something of the
order of $A0.75 so
that Bollinger's claim, assuming it is liable to the
Plaintiff in that regard, is of the order of $250,000.
<P>

20	To the conclusion expressed in paragraph 16 there is however one
qualification.  The Plaintiff's opportunity to successfully
litigate its claim
must not be prejudiced by matters such as jurisdictional limits or time bars
which may apply in New Zealand and
not in New South Wales.  Bollinger did not
dispute this reservation and, consistently with the statement that the
Plaintiff did not
intend to sue anyone in New Zealand, it was not suggested
that Pope might be involved in the reservation.  There was no attempt by
any
party to precisely formulate an order to give effect to it and it is of a
nature such that the parties should have an opportunity
to consider its
terms.
<P>

21	However there should be some limit on the time during which Bollinger is
exposed to further proceedings.  The matter has not
been argued but the normal
6 year limit from the accrual of the Plaintiff's cause of action does not seem
inappropriate.  Although
this may not be precise, I am disposed to select as
the commencement date for the period 8 November 1995, a date appearing on the
Bill of Lading.  Again, I will afford an opportunity to the parties to debate
this date.
<P>

22	Because the order staying proceedings here will have the result of imposing
extra costs on the Plaintiff if it does choose to
pursue its claim in New
Zealand, and Bollinger will be the substantial beneficiary of it, Bollinger
should bear these extra costs.
 Set out below is a form of order I propose in
this regard but because the precise form of this order also has not been the
subject
of argument, I will provide an opportunity to debate its form.
<P>

23	Pope has succeeded in its Notice of Motion of 8 December 1997 and is
entitled to its costs of the motion and, in light of all
of my reasons, of the
action against the Plaintiff.  Subject to the caveat that it desired only one
forum, Bollinger originally supported
the Plaintiff.  Although it has now had
some success, it should pay its own costs of and incidental to the motion. 
<P>

24	The general costs of the action both of the Plaintiff and of Bollinger,
other than those I have mentioned, should be determined
by the result of the
dispute between them.  Given no proceedings have been commenced by the
Plaintiff in New Zealand, the best course
seems to me to reserve them.  This
matter also was not argued.
<P>

25	The orders which seem to me appropriate are:
<P>

(i) 	Conditional on the First Defendant, Bollinger Shipping Agency Pty Limited,
undertaking to the Court that it will -
<P>

(a) 	submit to the jurisdiction of any court in New Zealand in which the
Plaintiff may, on or before 7 November 2001, commence proceedings
on the
cause(s) of action pleaded herein,
<P>

(b) 	subject to sub-paragraph (a) hereof, in such proceedings waive any defence
which would not be available to it in these proceedings,
and
<P>

(c) 	consent to any extension of time sought by the Plaintiff which is
necessary to give effect to sub-clause (b) hereof,
<P>

		stay the further prosecution of these proceedings.
<P>

(ii) 	Order the Plaintiff to pay the costs of the Second Defendant of and
incidental to the proceedings, including the costs of
and incidental to the
Notice of Motion of 8 December 1997.
<P>

(iii) 	Order the First Defendant to pay its own costs of and incidental to the
Notice of Motion of 8 December 1997
<P>

(iv) 	Order the First Defendant to pay so much of the Plaintiff's costs of and
incidental to the proceedings, other than the costs
of and incidental to the
Notice of Motion of 8 December 1997 and of and incidental to the Plaintiff's
claim against the Second Defendant,
as will not be of use to the Plaintiff if
it commences and prosecutes proceedings in a New Zealand court on the cause(s)
of action
pleaded herein.
<P>

(v) 	Subject to the foregoing, the general costs of the action other than those
I have mentioned, both of the Plaintiff and of the
first Defendant are
reserved.
<P>

(vi) 	Liberty to apply in respect of the conditions upon which the stay
referred to in order (i) hereof, is or may be, granted or
continued.
<P>

26 Without making those orders, I will publish these Reasons and stand the
proceedings over for a short period for the parties to
consider their form.
<P>
