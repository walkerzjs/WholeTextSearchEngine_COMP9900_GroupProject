24 FEBRUARY 1999
<P>

<b>4464/95  K A &amp; C SMITH PTY LTD (trading as Uticolor Australia)  V  BRIAN
DOUGLAS WARD &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 24 February 1999 and revised on 2 March
1999)</b>
<P>

1	On 23 December 1998 I handed down reasons for judgment on the substantive
issues in this matter.  I concluded that Mr Ward, the
first defendant, had
breached the restraint clause in the franchise agreement between him and the
plaintiff dated 6 January 1990,
and the plaintiff was entitled to damages for
that breach, but was not entitled to an injunction.  The plaintiff's claims
against
the second and fourth defendants (Starcar Pty Ltd and Mrs Ward) were
unsuccessful because they had not become parties to the franchise
agreement and
were not bound by it.  I found that the cross-claim brought by the first and
second defendants against the plaintiff
and Mr Lindsay Smith, its managing
director, failed.  I stood the matter over to give the parties the chance to
consider my lengthy
reasons for judgment, and to make submissions on costs and
other matters.  
<P>

2	Apart from the question of costs on the main proceedings and the cross-claim,
there were two other ancillary matters relating
to costs.  The first of these
arose out of the cross-defendants' successful application to amend their
defence to the cross-claim.
 The second arose out of my decision of 21 October
1998, which dealt with the plaintiff's application to restrain the enforcement
of a costs order in favour of the defendants made by Santow J on 11 July 1998.
In my reasons for judgment of 23 December 1998 I invited
the parties to make
submissions as to costs on the former application, but I had already heard
submissions as costs on the latter
application and I indicated that I proposed
to order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

3	When the matter came before me again on 19 February 1999, the following
issues were contested:
<P>

(a) 	the plaintiff's measure of damages;
<P>

(b) 	the proper orders for costs on the claim and cross-claim;
<P>

(c) 	costs on the cross-defendants' application to amend the defence to the
cross-claim.
<P>

4	I propose to deal with these three matters in the present judgment, and then
make my orders in the proceedings. 
<P>

	<b>The plaintiff's measure of damages</b>
<P>

5	In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I found that the first defendant failed to
perform the franchise agreement during the period
from approximately 27 April
1995 until approximately 16 June 1995, when the plaintiff accepted the first
defendant's repudiation
of the franchise agreement and brought it to an end.  I
held that damages for the breach of contract were properly measured by the
royalty and product payments which the plaintiff was entitled to receive under
the franchise agreement in respect of the North Shore
Uticolor business during
that period.  During the period from approximately 16 June 1995 to
approximately 26 April 1997 the first
defendant continued to breach the
restraint provision in clause 5 of the franchise agreement.  I held that an
appropriate measure
of damages for breach of the restraint clause during that
period would be to calculate the amount of royalty and product payments
which
the North Shore Uticolor business would have been required to pay had the first
defendant remained a franchisee during that
period.  In other words, the
measure of damages for the period from 16 June 1995 to 26 April 1997 was the
same as the measure of
damages for the period from 27 April 1995 to 16 June
1995.
<P>

6	The plaintiff contended that damages could be calculated as a 5% royalty
based on the gross actual income of the North Shore Uticolor
business during
the whole period (in my judgement, the period from 27 April 1995 to 16 June
1997) and adding to that figure an average
21.5% mark up on all produce
purchases during that period.  The plaintiff handed up a document which made
the calculation and showed
total damages of $28,693.67.  I indicated that the
plaintiff's figures would need to be revised, because they had made the
calculation
from 1 May 1995 to 2 May 1997 rather than from 27 April 1995 to 26
April 1997.  The plaintiff subsequently made that calculation,
and at the
further hearing on 19 February 1999, counsel for the plaintiff handed up a
revised calculation document showing a total
figure of $28,330.45.  The
plaintiff also claims interest in a total sum of $7,327.78.
<P>

7	In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I took the view that the plaintiff's
method of calculation of damages was undoubtedly correct
with respect to the
period from 27 April 1995 to 16 June 1995, when the franchise agreement came to
an end.  As to the period from
approximately 17 June 1995 until 26 April 1997,
I found the position to be more complicated.  However, I took the view that the
plaintiff's
method of calculating the loss was appropriate to be used for that
period provided the two conditions were satisfied.  The first
condition was
that on the facts, the first defendant's continuation of the North Shore
Uticolor business in breach of the restraint
clause prevented the plaintiff
from establishing a new franchise agreement in the North Shore of Sydney or
from benefiting through
sales by other franchisees in the North Shore area.
The second condition was that on the facts, the gross income actually generated
by Mr Ward's business and the purchases of products actually made by the
business would have been generated and made by a new Uticolor
franchisee if Mr
Ward's continuation of the North Shore Uticolor business in breach of the
restraint clause had not prevented the
appointment of a new franchisee.  
<P>

8	The defendants submitted at the hearing on 19 February 1999 that I erred in
my finding on the second question. In my judgment
of 23 December 1998 I said
that there was no evidence that the business of North Shore Uticolor expanded
into areas outside vinyl,
leather and plastic repairs during the two years
commencing April 1995. The defendants submitted on 19 February 1999 that there
was
evidence in the plaintiff's newsletter of 8 October 1993 that a major part
of Mr Ward's business was automotive spray and spot repairs
using paints which
he mixed up at the shop.  The defendants also referred to Mr Smith's affidavit
as to damages, sworn 4 September
1998. The defendants also attacked my finding
that under cl 6 of the franchise agreement the first defendant was obliged to
purchase
all supplies only from the plaintiff, and they referred to Mr Smith's
affidavit of 15 February 1996 in which he says he authorised
the first
defendant to buy certain products from someone else.
<P>

9	In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I took into account the evidence that Mr
Ward engaged in some such spray-painting activities
in reaching the conclusions
which I expressed in my judgment. This is why I acknowledged (revised judgment
page 43) that there was
"room for argument about some business activities". But
there was no evidence, as I said, of any expansion in Mr Ward's business
during
1995-1997 into other areas - that is areas not already occupied in April 1995.
I remain of that opinion.
<P>

10	I do not regard Mr Smith's "damages" affidavit of 4 September 1998 as
providing an alternative and more satisfactory way of calculating
damages than
the submissions made by the plaintiff at the hearing. The defendants
successfully objected to the admissibility of large
portions of that affidavit,
with the result that though the deponent's assertions as to his calculations
concerning estimated loss
remain, most of the reasoning which he used to reach
his conclusions was not admitted into evidence. The gap was not adequately
filled
by Mr Smith's oral evidence. I therefore find the affidavit of 4
September 1998 generally unhelpful and I prefer to adhere to the
method of
calculating loss which the plaintiff advocated at the hearing and which I
adopted and explained in my judgment of 23 December
1998.
<P>

11	In a case such as this no method of assessment of damages can avoid relying
on inferences and findings of fact on the balance
of probabilities from
relatively thin evidence, but I am satisfied that the method which I adopted is
a rational evaluation properly
based on such evidence as there is.
<P>

12	As to my conclusion that the first defendant was obliged to buy products
only from the plaintiff, I do not regard Mr Smith's
evidence as showing more
than that on occasions he waived his right in order to suit the particular
circumstances.
<P>

13	In the result I adhere to the conclusion which I expressed on 23 December
1998 that the correct method of calculating damages
for the whole period from
27 April 1995 to 26 April 1997 is as set out in the plaintiff's written
calculation handed up at the hearing.
However, I agree with the  defendants
that the plaintiff's actual calculation is deficient in one respect. The
"Amended Summary of
Materials" in the document handed up on 19 February 1999
lists and adds up a series of amounts for goods purchased by Mr Ward's business
during the two years from 27 April 1995, the total figure being $21,523.05.
Then the plaintiff's loss of sales profit is calculated
as $4,627.45, that
amount being 21.5 per cent of the total figure.  21.5 per cent is the
plaintiff's average mark-up. That process
contains an error in mathematical
logic.  One should calculate the amount ($X) which, if marked up by 21.5 per
cent, would produce
$21,523.05; and then the loss of sales profit is that
mark-up, namely $21,523.05, minus $X. According to my calculation $X is
$17,714.77
and the loss of sales profit is $3,808.28. I propose to make orders
on that basis.
<P>

14	The plaintiff also seeks interest on the two components of its damages (loss
of royalty and loss of profit on sale of materials)
for the period from
March/April 1996 to 19 February 1999 and continuing. Interest was claimed in
the amended Statement of Claim which
is the current pleading. In my opinion
there is a proper case for the award of interest under s 94 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</a><b>,</b> on the basis that the successful party ought ordinarily to be
compensated for the loss of use of money of which it has been wrongly
deprived
by the defendant: <b> </b><i>Falkner v Bourke</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20574" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 574.</a> Interest
should be applied at the rate set out in<b> </b>Sch J to the Supreme Court
Rules. It has not been contended that interest should be reduced by virtue of
some such factor as a settlement
offer.
<P>

15	It seems to me that the plaintiff's calculation of interest which was handed
up on 19 February 1999 was excessive because it
assumes that the whole of the
plaintiff's loss had accrued by the end of the first year of breach (that is by
April 1996). At that
stage only one year's loss of royalty and mark-up had
occurred. The calculation must be revised to reflect that point and also (as
explained above) the reduced capital figure for loss of mark-up.
<P>

16	I propose to take the simple course of calculating interest on an annual
basis rather than seeking to identify the point of time
at which each royalty
and mark-up payment would have accrued due and applying interest on the several
amounts from each of those
points of time. I do so in the interest of
simplicity.
<P>

17	In order to bring this case to a conclusion I have myself re-calculated the
interest claim on an annual basis and in accordance
with the principles
outlined above in a total sum of $6,642.08. I shall annex my calculations to
these reasons for judgment and I
have handed down a copy to the representative
of the plaintiff (the defendants not being represented before me today). In
case either
party wishes to take an issue about the method of calculation I
propose to grant leave to apply. I must say that if an application
is made with
respect to interest it is unlikely that the successful party, if success
occurs, will obtain an order for costs in view
of the relatively small amounts
involved.
<P>

	<b>Costs on the plaintiff's claim and the cross-claim</b>
<P>

18	In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to an order that its costs of the
proceedings be paid by the first defendant. The plaintiff
succeeded in
establishing that the first defendant breached a valid contract and that it
suffered loss in consequence of the breach.
It is true the plaintiff also
unsuccessfully claimed injunctive relief. I have no doubt that in terms of its
economic significance,
the claim for an injunction which would have
substantially prevented the first defendant from pursuing his livelihood was a
much
more serious threat to the first defendant and that his success in
resisting it was no small victory for him. But in my opinion that
is not a
sufficient basis for departing from the normal rule that costs should follow
the event.
<P>

19	The first defendant submits that as the plaintiff's damages are less than
$75,000 the case falls within<b> </b>Pt 52A r 33(2)(e) of the Supreme Court
Rules<i>.</i>  Therefore he says the plaintiff is not entitled to costs unless
it appears to the Court that the plaintiff had sufficient reason
for commencing
or continuing the proceedings in the Court and the Court makes an order for
payment. In my opinion that rule does
not apply to proceedings in the Equity
Division having regard to r 33(1)(a). If it did I would take the view on
balance that the
plaintiff had sufficient reason to commence and continue the
proceedings in this Court.  Although the plaintiff has succeeded in
proving its
entitlement to only a relatively small amount of damages, it asserted a claim
for damages which if proved would have
yielded a substantially higher figure.
It also sought an injunction to enforce the restraint clause for a period of
two years from
the time of the hearing. Such a claim is an appropriate one for
this Court.
<P>

20	As to the fourth defendant's costs I propose to order that they be paid by
the plaintiff. The fourth defendant was wholly successful
in the proceedings
and was not a party to the cross-claim. It is true that she and her husband
were represented by the same counsel
and solicitors at the hearing but I am not
in a position to make any inferences as to how she and her husband contributed
to any
joint costs of representation. That may be a matter for the assessing
officer to determine.
<P>

21	The plaintiff has urged me to make a Bullock or Sanderson order having the
effect that the fourth defendant's costs would be
borne by the first defendant.
Counsel relies on<b> </b><i>Lackersteen v Jones (No 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/NTSC/1988/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] NTSC 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2093%20FLR%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 93 FLR 442</a>;

of O'Bryan J in the last mentioned case (at 577):
<P>

	`The plaintiff cannot tell, in advance, which of the defendants will be held
to be legally responsible for his injuries, until
all the evidence is heard,
and it may well be that the defendants will contend against each other that the
other is legally responsible.
In such a case it is clearly reasonable for the
plaintiff to join more than one defendant in his action, and the unsuccessful
defendant
can be rightly said to be the cause of the whole litigation either
because of his conduct before action in not accepting sole responsibility
or
because his tortious conduct in the subject matter of the litigation was done
in such circumstances as to make the joinder of
the other defendant or
defendants reasonable.'
<P>

22	The key requirement for such an order is that at the commencement of the
action it must have been reasonable for the plaintiff
to join the first, second
and fourth defendants as defendants. In my opinion this requirement is not
satisfied in the present case.
A difficulty in the present case is that the
plaintiff amended its pleadings on several occasions, as outlined in my
judgment of
21 October 1998. That behaviour could not be said to be reasonable
even if steadfast adherence to a single pleading strategy could
have been so
described. Moreover, in this case the uncertainty as to the proper defendant
arose out of uncertainty as to the identity
of the contracting parties and the
effect of the alleged "assignment". These were transactions to which the
plaintiff was a party.
The uncertainty was as much attributable to the
plaintiff as to anyone and could have been avoided by clarity of thinking on
its
behalf. In other words the plaintiff itself contributed in no small measure
to the difficulty which lead it to sue three defendants
in circumstances where
it was highly likely that it would lose against at least one of them. This is
very different from a case in
tort where the plaintiff is an involuntary victim
seeking to establish vicarious as well as direct liability.
<P>

23	In the alternative, the plaintiff submits that I should make no order for
payment of the fourth defendant's costs, with the result
that she must bear her
costs herself. But I see no proper basis for doing so. The fourth defendant was
successful in her basic submission
that she was not a party to the franchise
agreement on which the plaintiff sued.
<P>

24	The plaintiff's third alternative is that I should make an order permitting
the fourth defendant to recover from the plaintiff
only the costs which are
separately identifiable and attributable to her, so that the common defence
costs of the defendants (which
are presumably the bulk of the defendants'
costs) would not be recoverable from the plaintiff.
<P>

25	In my opinion there is no satisfactory basis for making such an order. The
fourth defendant was successful in her defence and
should be able to recover
all her costs just as the plaintiff is entitled in my opinion to recover all
its costs from the first defendant,
even though many of its contentions failed.
I might add that if it is determined that the fourth defendant's costs are
approximately
one half of the total costs of the defendants, so that under my
orders the first defendant pays the whole of the plaintiff's costs
and the
fourth defendant recovers about half of the total defence costs from the
plaintiff, then in my opinion the overall outcome
will approximately reflect
the relative success of the parties.
<P>

26	In my opinion the position of the second defendant is quite different from
the position of the fourth defendant. While a Bullock
or Sanderson order is not
appropriate for the reasons already given, it would not be fair to order the
plaintiff to pay the second
defendant's costs without qualification. The second
defendant is a creature of the first and fourth defendants which no longer
trades.
The defendants submitted that the second defendant was liable under the
franchise agreement and the second defendant therefore succeeded
in spite of
the submission made on its behalf. I do not regard it as appropriate that the
second defendant's costs be recoverable
from the plaintiff.
<P>

27	I am concerned, however, that the effect of making no order for costs in
favour of the second defendant may be that the plaintiff
will be required to
bear a smaller proportion of the overall defence costs than I regard as
appropriate. If one third of common defence
costs were allocated to the second
defendant then the fourth defendant would be able to recover only one third of
the common defence
costs from the plaintiff rather than one half. My intention
in making no order for costs in favour of the second defendant is only
that the
second defendant cannot recover from the plaintiff those costs which are
separately identifiable as its costs. I propose
to make my intentions clear by
an appropriate direction in the orders which I shall make.
<P>

28	As to the cross-claim, I see no reason for departing from the usual approach
and so I propose to order that the cross-defendants'
costs be borne by the
cross-claimants, Mr Ward and Starcar.
<P>

<b>	Costs of application to amend defence to cross-claim</b>
<P>

29	In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I indicated that I was inclined to make
no order for costs on that application with the result
that each party would
bear their own costs of that matter. Though counsel addressed me on this point
on 19 February 1999 I believe
the correct course is to follow this inclination.
Whilst the cross-defendants' application succeeded it was made at an extremely
late stage and in order to correct a mistake in the earlier pleadings. The
cross-claimants were right to complain about the untimeliness
of the
application to amend.  Although I decided that by allowing the amendment I
would not unduly prejudice them, they should not
be required to bear the
cross-defendants' costs of the application.
<P>

	<b>Orders</b>
<P>

30	On 19 February 1999 the plaintiff handed up draft short minutes of order. I
have amended that document so that it reflects my
reasons for judgment just
delivered.  I make the following orders: 
<P>

1. 	Judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant on the Statement of
Claim in the sum of $27,511.28 together with interest
thereon of $6,642.08.
<P>

2. 	Statement of Claim otherwise dismissed.
<P>
