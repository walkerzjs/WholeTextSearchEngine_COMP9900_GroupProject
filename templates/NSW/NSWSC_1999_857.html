<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR:  The appellant, Joan Pierpoint, appeals
against the decision of a magistrate in proceedings which were commenced
in the
Local Court at Port Macquarie and completed at the Downing Centre, Sydney. The
appellant was the defendant to an action brought
by the respondent, Elizabeth
Pittis, which resulted in judgment being entered for the respondent for $14,500
plus costs.
<P>

2    	The appellant is a solicitor.  At the relevant time
she had an office at Port Macquarie, where she employed another solicitor,
Mr
Timothy Fox.  In June 1996 the respondent retained her for the purpose of the
purchase of a property at Port Macquarie, and it
was Mr Fox who had the
carriage of the matter.  After contracts were exchanged it was discovered that
the house had structural problems
requiring repair.  The respondent did not
proceed with the purchase and forfeited the deposit which had been paid on
exchange of
contracts.  She sued the appellant for the amount of that deposit
and associated expenses.
<P>

3    	The basis of the action with which this appeal is
concerned is the allegation that the appellant, through Mr Fox, was negligent
in failing to advise the respondent to obtain a building report before
contracts were exchanged.  There was an issue of fact whether
any such advice
had been given.  His Worship found that it had not and that it should have
been.  No complaint is made about that
in the appeal.  The difficulty arises in
relation to the question of causation, that is, whether the respondent would
have obtained
a building report even if she had been advised to do so.
<P>

4    	She was cross-examined about this at the hearing
before the magistrate.  She agreed that she had been on a tight budget and
that
any additional expenditure would have placed her in difficulty.  Nevertheless,
she insisted that she would have found the fee
for a building report if she had
been advised to obtain one.  Her evidence was that she had acted upon any
advice she received in
relation to the purchase of the property: for example,
the recommendation of an estate agent that she obtain a pest report.
<P>

5    	In his reasons for judgment, his Worship dealt with
this aspect of the matter as follows:
<P>

...another matter which is to be considered is whether or not the Plaintiff
would have obtained a report even if Mr Fox had advised
her to do so.  The
defence submits that from the evidence of the Plaintiff she indicated that she
didn't want to proceed with the
purchase of the property because her budget was
such that she could not afford to expend money on repairs.  The defence makes
reference
to evidence given by the plaintiff in which she was asked:
<P>

Q:	In fact because you budgeted down to the last dollar, it would have been
extremely difficult if you'd incurred any additional
expenditure, wouldn't
it?
<P>

A:	Yes
<P>

The defence submitted that it should be found that Ms Pittis would not have
followed the advice of Mr Fox in relation to obtaining
a Building Report
because of her finances, and hence causation has not been established.
<P>

In reply to that submission Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the
Plaintiff always did what she was told to do in relation
to the purchase of
this property.  When the Plaintiff was told to obtain a Pest Report she made
arrangements for a Pest report to
be obtained.  After the exchange when Mr Fox
(sic) advised her to obtain a structural report she made arrangements for one
to be
obtained. <i> It is unknown as to whether or not the Plaintiff would have
taken action to obtain a Building Report, to say one way or the other
would be
mere speculation.  Having failed to advise the Plaintiff to obtain a structural
report, the Defendant cannot rely upon speculation
as to whether or not the
Plaintiff would have heeded that advice to submit to the court that causation
has not been established.</i>
<P>

(The emphasis is mine. In the last sentence I have corrected an obvious
typographical error where the word "Plaintiff" appears but
"Defendant" was
intended.)
<P>

6    	Implicit in the italicised passage is the assumption
that the appellant bore the burden of establishing that the respondent
would
not have heeded advice to obtain a building report, if it had been given.  This
was to misapprehend the burden of proof in
relation to causation, and it is
common ground in the appeal that his Worship fell into error in that respect.
In an action for damages
arising from the negligent omission to provide advice,
it is for the plaintiff to prove that he or she "would have taken action to
obtain the benefit or avoid the risk" embraced by that advice: <i>Allied Maples
Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] EWCA Civ 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%204%20All%20ER%20907" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 4 All ER 907</a>, per Stuart-Smith LJ
at 915: see also <i>McKellar v Blake </i>(Court of Appeal, unreported 30
October 1998).  This leads to the only question which I have been asked to
determine in this appeal:
what relief, if any, should be afforded to the
appellant?
<P>

7    	Counsel for the appellant, Mr Dicker, submitted that
I should allow the appeal and enter judgment for the appellant.  He argued
that
the italicised passage from the magistrate's reasons demonstrates that, if his
Worship had applied the burden of proof correctly,
he would have found that the
respondent had failed to establish that she would have obtained a building
report if advised to do so.
 That being so, causation would not have been
proved and the respondent's claim must have failed.
<P>

8    	He relied upon <i>McKellar v Blake </i>(supra), in
which the Court of Appeal set aside a judgment for a plaintiff in the District
Court and substituted judgment for the
defendant in circumstances similar to
the present case.  That was a case in which it was alleged that the defendant,
a medical practitioner,
had failed adequately to warn the plaintiff about the
risks of a surgical procedure.  The trial judge found that, because of the
inadequacy of the warning, the plaintiff was unable to make an informed
decision about whether to undergo the surgery.  His Honour
found that "if she
had been fully informed of the facts her decision might have been different",
and that this was sufficient to
entitle her to a verdict.
<P>

9    	It was common ground in that appeal that his Honour
had erred, the true test being whether the plaintiff would not have undergone
the surgery if an adequate warning had been given.  That had been the effect of
her evidence, and in his judgment his Honour referred
to that evidence without
expressing any finding about it. Nevertheless, in the view of the Court of
Appeal, it was implicit in his
Honour's reasons that he did not accept it.
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the proper course was to substitute
judgment for
the defendant, rather than ordering a new trial.
<P>

10    	The first submission of counsel for the present
respondent, Ms Hartstein, was that the italicised passage from his Worship's
reasons, correctly understood, was not a finding of fact.  It was no more than
an encapsulation, admittedly based upon a misapprehension
as to the law, of an
argument on behalf of the respondent in reply to the appellant's submission
that she would not have been prepared
to meet the expense of a building
report.
<P>

11    	In any event, the argument continued, the only
finding reasonably open to his Worship was that the respondent would have
obtained a report if she had been advised to do so.  That was her evidence, and
it was consistent with the fact that she had complied
with other advice about
steps to be taken in connection with the property.  In his reasons his Worship
made no observation expressly
adverse to the respondent's credibility.  Indeed,
on the question of whether she had been advised to obtain a report, his Worship
preferred her evidence to that of Mr Fox, about which he expressed "some grave
reservations".  It was submitted that I should conclude
that the respondent had
discharged her burden of proof on the issue of causation and that, accordingly,
this appeal should be dismissed.
<P>

12    	I am satisfied that the relevant part of his
Worship's reasons is a finding of fact, not merely the summary of a submission.
The passage from the reasons quoted above is all his Worship had to say on this
issue.  It is clear, then, that the last two sentences
were intended to express
his conclusion.
<P>

13    	What is more troubling is whether it is open to me
to set aside that finding and, recognising the burden of proof born by
the
respondent, arrive at my own view on the issue.  Mr Dicker submitted that I
could not do so.  He argued that this is not a case
such as <i>Warren v Coombes
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20142%20CLR%20531" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 142 CLR 531</a>, where an appellate court is as well placed as the trial
court to draw inferences from established facts.  Rather, it is an appeal
in
which I should not disturb a finding of fact by the court of trial, recognising
that court's advantage in having seen and heard
the witnesses: <i>Abalos v
Australian Postal Commission </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%2d91%29%20171%20CLR%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990-91) 171 CLR 167</a>, per McHugh J at 178;
<i>Devries v Australian National Railways Commission </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%2d93%29%20177%20CLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992-93) 177 CLR 472</a>,
per Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 479.
<P>

14    	I think that Mr Dicker's submission is sound.  In
any event, there is another reason why I could not take the course urged
on
behalf of the respondent.  The observations of the High Court about the powers
of appellate courts referred to in the previous
paragraph were concerned with
appeals by way of re-hearing.  The present appeal is not.  It is brought
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act </i>1970</a>, which
incorporates the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act </i>1902</a> as far as
they are applicable.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 69(2)</a> permits an appeal to this Court only on a
question of law.  The somewhat more expansive right of appeal conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s104.html" class="autolink_findacts">s104</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> </i>would appear to be confined to convictions or orders
under that Act, and to have no application to civil claims.
<P>

15    	It does not follow, however, that the appellant is
entitled to the orders which she seeks.  With respect, I am concerned
about the
adequacy of his Worship's reasons on the issue of causation.  He referred to
the respondent's evidence about her budgetary
restraints, but not to her
evidence that she would still have obtained a building report if she had been
advised to do so.  In this
respect, this case is distinct from <i>McKeller v
Blake</i>.  This was the critical evidence, and it was essential that his
Worship determine whether or not he accepted it.  I am not persuaded
that the
italicised passage from his judgment conveys that he did not.  The fact is that
he did not give the matter proper consideration,
no doubt, as a result of his
misapprehension about where the burden of proof lay.  Accordingly, his
Worship's reasons are deficient
because of their failure appropriately to deal
with an essential issue of fact: cf <i>Mifsud v Campbell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR
725</a>, per Samuels JA at 728.
<P>

16    	It would seem that the powers of this Court in an
appeal such as this are those set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s109.html" class="autolink_findacts">s109</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></i> (while
acknowledging that that section also appears to be directed to convictions or
orders under that Act).  Among them is the power
to remit the matter to the
magistrate who heard it and, in the circumstances of this case, I see no
alternative but to do so.  I
am mindful of the relatively modest amount of the
judgment and of the fact that this is not a course favoured by either party.
Nevertheless,
it is the course which justice requires: cf <i>McKeller v
Blake</i>, per Sheppard AJA at p8.
<P>

17    	The judgment in the Local Court is set aside and the
matter is remitted to the learned magistrate to be determined according
to law.
I shall hear the parties on costs.
