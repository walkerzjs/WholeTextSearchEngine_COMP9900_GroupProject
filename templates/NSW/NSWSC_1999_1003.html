WALES<br>COMMON LAW DIVISION<br>ADMINISTRATIVE LAW LIST<br><br><br>MASTER
MALPASS<br><br>FRIDAY 1 OCTOBER 1999<br><br><u>30039/1999	SORIN SOARE &amp; ANOR
v RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES TRIBUNAL/RESIDENTIAL TRIBUNAL &amp;
ORS</u><br><br><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b><br><br>1  	In 1995, the
plaintiffs became the tenants of premises known as 2/5 Bowman Street, Richmond
(the premises).  The landlords were
the second
defendants.<br><br>2  	It appears that the plaintiffs made a claim for
damages which related to a defective hot water service.  It had been brought out
of time and was dismissed on 6 January 1999 by the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal (the tribunal).  The second defendants served a
Notice of Termination
and also brought an application for termination and vacant possession of the
premises in the tribunal.<br><br>3  	On 2 February 1999, by Summons
the plaintiffs commenced proceedings in this Court.  The process sought the
setting aside of the
order dismissing their application.  In relation to that
matter, the plaintiffs were claiming that there had been a denial of natural
justice, a failure to consider all orders sought and a failure to fully give an
opportunity to fully present claims.<br><br>4  	The second
defendants&#8217; application in the tribunal came before a member (Mr Vrabac). 
There was a hearing on 23 February
1999.  The plaintiffs appeared in person. 
They were provided with a Romanian/French interpreter.  Mr Devine of Havelock
Real Estate
appeared for the second defendants.  Certain findings were made. 
Certain orders were made.  This material may be found in a written
document
which records the orders made and the reasons for the &#8220;interim
decision&#8221;.  It was the second defendants&#8217;
case that there had been a
breach of the agreement by reason of the non-payment of rent.  The plaintiffs
advanced an argument that
by reason of the contents of a letter dated 4 June
1998 there had been a waiver in relation to the payment of rent.  The member
found
that there had been no such waiver.  He found that there had been a breach
of the agreement by reason of the arrears in rental. 
An order was made to pay
the arrears of $520 by 9 March 1999.  Questions of hardship were argued.  The
member found that the hardship
seemed to be greater on the second defendants
than the plaintiffs.  He further found that the second defendants were entitled
to
issue a Notice of Termination pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 57</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential
Tenancies Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).  The further hearing of the second
defendants&#8217; application (including the issue of retaliation) was adjourned
to
another hearing day.<br><br><br>5  	In the proceedings then in this
Court, further Notices of Motion were filed (on 8 March and 10 March 1999).  In
these applications,
relief was sought in relation to what happened on 23
February 1999.  Again, there was a claim of denial of natural justice.  The
Summons was amended.<br><br>6  	On 30 March 1999, the arrears of
rental were paid by the plaintiffs.  On 1 April 1999, an application for the
summary dismissal
of the proceedings then in this Court came before Dunford J. 
Judgment was delivered on that day.  The judgment records that all
submissions
made on behalf of the plaintiff were recorded in the transcript.  Dunford J said
that he could see no error of law and
was satisfied that the second defendants
were entitled to summary dismissal and he made an order pursuant to Pt 13 r 5 of
the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</u> 1970</a>.<br><br>7  	The judgment delivered
by Dunford J records inter alia that he dealt with matters which are sought to
be re-agitated in these
proceedings.  I shall mention some of the matters
recorded in the judgment.  It records that he perused the reasons given on 23
February
1999.  It appears that his Honour dealt with submissions concerning
alleged errors of law and denial of natural justice.  His Honour
observed inter
alia that the reasons disclosed no error of law or denial of natural justice. 
He observed that it had been suggested
that the reasons did not correctly
represent what had transpired at the hearing.  He further observed that no
justification had been
shown for him to go behind those reasons.  He did not
accept the contentions that there were defects in the proceedings and that
the
tribunal did not take into account various parts of the evidence which were
available.  He saw certain of these complaints as
amounting to no more than a
submission that the tribunal came to the wrong decision.  Specific reference was
made to an argument
as to waiver.  In relation to this matter, his Honour
observed &#8220;once again I can see no error of law&#8221;.  A question
relating
to the use of the interpreter was also unsuccessfully
raised.<br><br>8  	The proceedings in the tribunal came back before
the member on 28 April 1999 (there is evidence that it had also been before the
tribunal on 31 March 1999).  An order was made for termination and possession
(possession to be given on 10 June 1999).<br><br>9  	By document dated
3 May 1999, the tribunal gave notice of the orders made on 28 April 1999 and
provided reasons for the decision.
 By document dated 29 June 1999, it provided
amended reasons.  It is convenient to digress and observe that these documents
are largely
similar in substance.  It may be that they contain some factual
error.  In my view any such error is not of
significance.<br><br>10  	On 18 May 1999, the plaintiffs sought a
re-hearing of the decision of the tribunal.  This application was unsuccessful
(it was
refused on 24 May 1999).  Whilst it has been said that this may have
been dealt with as an application pursuant to s 110 of the Act
it was in fact
made to and determined by the Residential Tribunal as an application for
re-hearing pursuant to s 63 of the <u>Residential Tribunal Act</u>
1998.<br><br>11  	The present proceedings were commenced by Summons
filed on 1 June 1999.  Pursuant to an order of this Court, the plaintiff filed
Points of Claim.  The document sets out four categories of complaint.  The
relevant headings are &#8220;<u>Re Swain&#8217;s Case&#8221;</u> (RTA v<u>
</u>Swain  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 452)</a>, &#8220;<u>Bias Issues</u>&#8221;,
&#8220;<u>Failure to Exercise Jurisdiction &amp; &#8216;Wednesbury&#8217;
Unreasonableness</u>&#8221; and &#8220;<u>Decision not open on the
Facts</u>&#8221;.  These proceedings are in effect an appeal under s 107 of the
Act.  A number of affidavits have been filed in support of
the
appeal.<br><br>12  	The second defendants have brought a Summary
Dismissal Application.  This application was heard on 31 August 1999.  All
parties
were represented by counsel.<br><br>13  	Section 107 of the
Act deals with &#8220;Appeal against decision of Tribunal with respect to matter
of law&#8221;.  It enables
only a restricted ambit of challenge to be brought to
this Court.  An appeal lies only where &#8220;the Tribunal decides a question
with respect to a matter of law&#8221;.  The reference to &#8220;a matter of
law&#8221; is expressed to include &#8220;a matter relating
to the Jurisdiction
of the Tribunal&#8221;.<br><br>14  	I shall first look at the
complaints which are made under the heading of &#8220;<u>Re Swain&#8217;s
Case</u>&#8221;.  It is said that the tribunal failed to make any decision in
relation to the issues of hardship.  This submission is clearly
erroneous.  I
have already referred to the finding made on 23 February 1999.  Any complaint as
to this finding should have been agitated
before Dunford  J.  More of the
reasoning process was disclosed in the documents dated 3 May 1999 and 29 June
1999.  Questions of
inter alia hardship were taken into account in considering
whether or not to make an order terminating the agreement.  It is said
that the
tribunal erred in law by not considering the provisions of s 65 (2) (b) of the
Act.  This contention is also erroneous.
 The matter of the remedying of the
breach was taken into account.  This appears from the documentation which
disclosed the reasoning
process.  There is a further attempt to re-agitate the
merger question.  This is an abuse of process as the question was finally
dealt
with in the appeal before Dunford J.<br><br>15  	I now turn to the
&#8220;<u>Bias Issues</u>&#8221;.  The Points of Claim allege actual bias only. 
Evidence in support of these issues is to be found in an affidavit sworn on
22
June 1999.  Paragraphs 2 - 31 set forth in that affidavit relate to allegations
as to what took place on 23 February 1999.  The
vehicle for the ventilation of
these complaints was the appeal which came before Dunford J.  Although the
relevant transcript was
not placed before this Court, it appears that matters of
denial of natural justice were agitated before his Honour and rejected by
him. 
I should also add that it appears that questions of bias were not raised before
the tribunal.  There are also complaints made
as to alleged matters taking place
on 31 March and 28 April 1999.  I have carefully perused each of the various
matters of complaint.
 I am satisfied that any case founded on denial of natural
justice in respect of these matters (or any of them) is doomed to
failure.<br><br>16  	Although the case as pleaded was restricted to an
allegation of actual bias, it was still sought to agitate a case based on
apprehended
bias.  For completeness, I should observe that the alleged matters
do not throw up any legal basis for disturbing the orders made
by the
tribunal.<br><br>17  	The matters which appear under the headings
&#8220;<u>Failure to Exercise Jurisdiction &amp; &#8216;Wednesbury&#8217;
Unreasonableness</u>&#8221; and &#8220;<u>Decision not open on the
Facts</u>&#8221; have at least in part been dealt with earlier in this judgment.
As I have said, no appeal lies in respect of matters of fact.
 There is no
remedy merely because the plaintiffs may be unhappy about the decisions made by
the tribunal.  This Court is not at
liberty to intervene simply because it may
have taken a different view on evidence.  I am unable to identify error of law
in relation
to any of these matters.<br><br>18  	The court has a
discretionary power to summarily dismiss proceedings.  The authorities make it
clear that the remedy should be
exercised only in what might be described as
clear cases.  The onus demonstrating an entitlement to such relief rests with
the applicant.
 The power is exercised so as to ensure that justice between the
parties is best served.<br><br>19  	I am satisfied that this is one of
those clear cases.  I should add that there has now been an application for
re-hearing and
two appeals in respect of the second defendants&#8217;
application to the tribunal.  Justice requires that litigation be brought
to
finality.<br><br>20  	I order that the proceedings be dismissed. The
plaintiffs are to pay the costs of the proceedings.  The exhibit may be
returned.<br><br>21  	In conclusion, it may be helpful to make a
general observation relevant to what are often referred to as minor
administrative
appeals.  Generally speaking it may be an unproductive exercise
to pursue summary relief in administrative appeals.  There is the
risk of two
hearings rather than one.  Mostly the hearing of the appeal itself will occupy
little more time than the hearing of a
summary relief application.<br><br></p>
