<b>JUDGMENT (On application for adjournment - T3086)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  By a Notice of Motion filed in court on 30
November, the plaintiff seeks the following order (1):
<P>

<i>"Following the plaintiff's evidence on damage the trial be adjourned until
commencement of the new term in February 2000."</i>
<P>

2   	In support of the Motion two affidavits were relied upon.
The first is that of Mr Nassir Bechara sworn 30 November 1999. Paragraphs
1, 2,
8 and 9 were read without objection, paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 were admitted over
objection. Paragraphs 3 and 4 were not read.
This deponent was cross-examined.
He has been employed on a contract basis by Marsdens since October in relation
principally to the
damages claim but also to assist in the discovery process.
He has but a limited understanding in relation to what I will describe
as the
$240,000 matter consequent upon orders of the Court of Appeal. He has made no
inquiry, and he knows of nobody else who has
made an inquiry as to "<i>the
availability of counsel of whatever level and experience to act for Mr Marsden
through to the end of 17 December 1999</i>" (T2982.30 per Nicholas Q.C.). 
<P>

3   	The second affidavit was that of Mr Potter sworn on 26
November 1999. It was read without objection subject to it being relevant,
which it clearly became. Mr Potter was cross-examined.  From his evidence I
find that Mr Marsden's position vis-a-vis Mr Barker Q.C.
is unchanged in this
sense, that Mr Barker's unavailability until the new term has been known since
August.
<P>

4   	Second: Mr Barker has now been retained from the first day
of term 2000, subject to what has been described as "<i>the financial
aspect</i>".
<P>

5   	Third: that financial aspect as at the date on which Mr
Potter gave his oral evidence is very close, or was then very close
to a
position of finality. Nothing in Mr Potter's evidence would lead to any view
that the situation will be otherwise than that
the financial aspects will be
attended to.
<P>

6   	Fourth: Mr Potter has not made any inquiry as to counsel on
the damages question. That is clear from his oral evidence.
<P>

7   	Fifth: Mr Potter has not made any inquiry as to the
availability of counsel on the truth issue other than of Mr Barker who,
as a
matter of record of course, appeared at the jury trial in this action, and
during the critical Amendment Application. 
<P>

8   	A generalised assertion that the plaintiff has made no
inquiry as to the availability of counsel to act for him up to 17 December
is
not open on the evidence, or in the face of the record by reason of Mr Donohoe
Q.C. and Mr Hall's appearance on the damages issue,
and by reason of the
inquiries of Mr Barker.
<P>

9   	The point is that no step has been taken to engage counsel
for the truth issue and act for the plaintiff on that issue up to
the end of 17
December this year. That, on, the material, is indisputable.
<P>

10   	Other evidence is made up of Exhibit 1, tendered by the
defendant, being the transcript of proceedings in the Court of Appeal
on 13
September 1999. The relevant part of that transcript is at page 4, and I read
from some remarks of the President to provide
a context for the statement made
by Mr Reynolds S.C. His Honour said:
<P>

<i>"I am very conscious of the fact that Levine J intended your client to be
put in funds so as to get on with the trial as a represented
party.</i>
<P>

<i>REYNOLDS: In the sense it is blunter than that. If my client doesn't get
these funds he will be presenting the case personally. That's
what it amounts
to.  That's the suggestion that we're making, and they are my
instructions."</i>
<P>

11   	I make no comment on his Honour's observation. The fact
relied upon is the statement by Mr Reynolds as at 13 September that
in the
event of the matters he refers to, the plaintiff will be representing
himself.
<P>

12   	Exhibit B is a bundle of correspondence that has passed
between Mallesons Stephen Jacques, solicitors for the defendant, and
Marsdens.
<P>

13   	On 13 September, coincidentally the day on which Mr
Reynolds made his statement to the Court of Appeal, Marsdens wrote a letter
which was addressed to my associate, but a copy of which appears to have been
provided to the defendant's solicitors. In that letter
the plaintiff makes an
observation  propos the trial resuming on 15 November.  He was endeavouring to
be ready on that day, and noted
that the "<i>learned judge had said there would
be no further adjournments</i>", stating his need to clarify his position in
relation to recoverable costs.
<P>

14   	The only observation I make with regard to the letter of
13 September is that I could find no statement by myself that there
would be
"<i>no further adjournments"</i>.  Be that as it may, as I understand the
letter it is relied upon, as evidencing a perception in the plaintiff, at the
very least,
as to his chances of any such development.
<P>

15   	On 5 November Mallesons wrote to Mr Marsden, apparently in
response to a request, with that firm's assessment of the likely
course the
proceedings would take. Mallesons state their view:
<P>

<i>"1.	We estimate that the evidence from your damages and reputation witnesses
should take about two weeks.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	If you choose to give evidence in the plaintiff's case, we anticipate
that will commence on approximately 29 November 1999.  If
7 court days are
allowed for your evidence, the defendant's first truth witnesses will commence
their evidence on or about 8 December
1999 and will continue until the end of
the Court term on 17 December 1999.  The balance of the defendant's truth
witnesses will
give evidence, presumably from 31 January 2000 onwards.  They
will be followed by the witnesses on qualified privilege.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	If you choose not to give evidence in your case in chief, the defendant's
truth witnesses will commence giving evidence on or about
29 November 1999 and
will continue until the end of the Court term.  The balance of the defendant's
truth witnesses will give evidence,
presumably from 31 January 2000 onwards.
They will be followed by the witness on qualified privilege".</i>
<P>

16   	As a matter of history of course the prognostications of
the defendant, who cannot be criticised for forming a view as they
saw it as of
5 November, have not been shown to be accurate.
<P>

17   	Included in Exhibit 2 is a letter from Marsdens dated 11
November 1999 that refers to the plaintiff having provided a witness
list on 25
August this year, and to something that might be described as a confusion of
information, as at 11 November 1999, relating
to whether or not the plaintiff
would give evidence. I propose not to further remark on that letter.
<P>

18   	There are two other letters, the significance of which is
that they play no part in the resolution of this motion.
<P>

19   	On 25 June, 1999 in DLJT:45 I gave directions after the
delivery of the judgment on the Amendment Application. The fourth
direction is
in these terms:  "<i>At the trial the defendant is directed to present its case
on justification and qualified privilege in that order. In that regard:
(a) the
defendant is to present its case on justification by commencing with D1 and
then in numerical sequence to D24</i>". Subparagraph (c) provided that the time
within the notification of the witnesses was to be made would be the subject of
further
directions.
<P>

20   	A letter dated 3 September, 1999 from the defendant
solicitors to Marsdens indicates an order of witnesses which commences
with
Shane Olive (D18), then proceeds to Mr Stalls (D1), then Mr Kinsella (D5) and
then Mr Ray Leary (D23). On 12 October the order
indicated in relation to the
first 4 witnesses was Mr Olive (D18), Mr David Maynard (D15), Mr John Maynard
(D16), Mr Stalls (D1).
<P>

21   	I raised the question during Mr Marsden's submissions that
those letters on their face did not indicate compliance with the
Direction I
had given. The defendant relied on consent orders made on 13 August, the
relevant one of which is number 2, that the
defendant is "<i>to provide the
plaintiff with a list of names of the witnesses to be called and the order in
which they will be called on the issue
of justification by 3 September
1999"</i>.
<P>

22   	It is not necessary for me to make a finding about that.
But I will express the view that I do not presently consider the
consent orders
to have varied the direction other than as in accordance with the direction to
provide a date by which  the list of
names was to be provided. But there has
been no complaint about that. The nub of Mr Marsden's submission in this
application is that
he will be confronted by the calling of truth witnesses. I
certainly am in no position to make a qualitative judgment about those
witnesses.  The matter of apparent non-compliance with the direction is a
non-issue in the adjournment application. 
<P>

23   	Further I will not take as evidence, or in any other way,
what the plaintiff said from the bar table as to other counsel,
as to the
personal attributes of anticipated witnesses for the defendant, or indeed his
own. Other matters clearly by way of submission
I will have regard to: the
question of fairness, matters of history in light of earlier rulings and the
like.
<P>

24   	The essence of the plaintiff's basis for the application
was set out in an affirmative answer to a question from myself at
page 2976.
The import was that the only reason, or it may be the principal reason, for the
adjournment application, is that a firm
of solicitors, Phillips Fox, and Senior
Counsel, Mr Barker, are now in a position to act for the plaintiff in meeting
the defendant's
case on truth, that Mr Barker is not available until 31
January, the first day of the new term.
<P>

25   	The essence of the application in terms of relevant
principle was stated by counsel for the defendant at the close of his
submissions at T3021.25 in these terms: <i>"in the interests of the overall
justice of this case at this point of time to both parties would require the
rejection of the application."</i>
<P>

26   	The statement I have reproduced was made in a context that
was important, and I will return to it. 
<P>

27   	What is the point of time in the trial over which I am
presiding? As at the conclusion of submissions at about 11.30 yesterday,
we
were in the middle of a four day week, it being the second last week of term
and the fourth week of the resumed hearing. We are
in the presentation of the
plaintiff's case on damages in which hitherto thirty-nine witnesses have been
called, and, perhaps inconsequentially
I add, fourteen rulings have been
delivered since 15 November. We are at a point where the duration of the
plaintiff's case cannot
be in any finite way identified.  What is now clear is
that the plaintiff will not be giving evidence in it, and what is equally
clear
is that had he chosen to do so, this present exercise would be academic.
<P>

28   	Also at this point of time there is part-heard an
application for inspection by the defendant of documents set out in the
plaintiff's list recently served pursuant to order. About half an hour has been
spent on that matter. As to inspection, it is said
by Mr Wheelhouse to be of
the utmost importance to the presentation of the justification case; so
important, that I should rule in
favour of the plaintiff, steps forthwith will
be taken to institute an appeal.
<P>

29   	Not having heard submissions what I will decide is
unknown. If I decide adversely to the defendant, it will only be a matter
of
speculation as to what the Court of Appeal will do, and if it does anything,
whether it's intervention, that is by doing anything,
will in effect operate in
some way as a stay of the progress of the hearing which the defendant  is
anxious otherwise to secure.
<P>

30   	What are the interests of the defendant?  It will be ready
to proceed to call its truth witnesses, about four, doing the best
one can to
anticipate progress, and taking into account as far as necessary the unresolved
inspection application. The witnesses
have been ready on a prior occasion. So
have presumably those of the plaintiff.
<P>

31   	The readiness of the defendant is to call truth witnesses
to be dealt with by an unrepresented plaintiff. I do not concern
myself with
the forensic manoeuvring and obvious forensic advantage to the defendant of
that situation. The unrepresented plaintiff
is to deal with such witnesses on
such an important issue: that is a matter that goes, at least, to his
interests.
<P>

32   	The defendant submits the position in which the plaintiff
presently finds himself is one which can be characterised as his
being the
author of his own misfortune, to adopt the language of the justices of the High
Court in <b><i>Sali v SPC Limited and Another</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20116%20ALR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 116 ALR 625</a> at
631.29. <b><i>Sali's</i></b> case, leaving aside the valuable statement of
principles by their honours, like<b> <i>The State of Queensland v JL
Holdings</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d7%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-7) 189 CLR 146</a>, on a factual basis, is far removed from
the present circumstances. The former is concerned with proceedings in an
appeal court,
the latter with the question of an adjournment well before any
trial had commenced.
<P>

33   	At this point the plaintiff's case has run quite smoothly
over four weeks, about one and a half hours only being lost by reason
of
running out of witnesses. At this point of time neither side can be criticised
for that.  No doubt the plaintiff did not anticipate
Mr Lyall lasting about two
minutes upon his being called on 15 November, and then there taking three days
to complete his evidence.
The defendant no doubt did not anticipate having the
opportunity legitimately to expend so much time, including a whole day of
cross-examination
with Dr Dent, in the light of the events that occurred during
his evidence.
<P>

34   	I do not see any benefit in speculating at this point, or
hypothesising, as to what would have been the position had Mr Marsden
been
appearing in fact alone - that is unrepresented  - from August.  Nor do I see
any point in speculating or hypothesising as to
what the position would have
been had the plaintiff's case, with representation, in fact ended at the end of
what I understand to
be Mr Donohoe's two week retainer from November 15.
<P>

35   	At this point of time it further has to be observed that
there is no evidence before me other than that the defendant will
be ready to
begin at the end of the plaintiff's case on damages. By that I mean there is no
evidence that it will not be ready on
any day from 31 January 2000 or that
there has been lost to it witnesses and the like.
<P>

36   	The only matter adverted to, by way of submission in this
context, is the natural fading of human memory in a case in which
alleged
events are said to have occurred decades ago, at the earliest.  The four or
five witnesses ready now for the defendant, in
the absence of evidence to the
contrary, safely can be assumed will be ready whenever called, and would have
been ready next year
in the event, for example, of the plaintiff having gone
into the witness box and the balance of this Term taken up with his being
dealt
with.  
<P>

37   	A point of time has been reached which exposes a situation
which, with stark simplicity can be described as the plaintiff's
case on
damages will soon end.  Mr Marsden has been represented by Mr Donohoe, for two
weeks, commendably by Mr Hall who still appears
for him, and by himself.
<P>

38   	The defendant will be ready, as I have said.  Its
representation has been, on a comparative basis, quite stable.  Importantly,
that which the defendant will be ready to do is to present its first four or so
witnesses on the most profoundly significant component
of the trial: its case
on the truth of the defamatory imputations which constitute serious charges
against the plaintiff.  The evidence
will be led from about 28 people relating
to the plaintiff's alleged sexual misconduct.  That is the case the presently
unrepresented
plaintiff will be called upon to deal with in whatever number of
days will be left this year.  That is the case the plaintiff, with
the
independent, detached representation of a senior member of the bar who has been
in this trial, will otherwise have to meet from
31 January 2000.
<P>

39   	Consistency in approach has been urged upon me (the
context of Mr Nicholas' remarks above) and rightly so, by reference to
at least
eight earlier judgments or rulings of my own being:  DLJ:2 of 5 May 1998 which
dealt with the application for expedition;
DLJ:4 of 18 September 1988 which
dealt with the fixing of hearing dates for the expedited hearing; DLJ:5 of 23
October 1998, which
dealt with an application for a three day adjournment
during the trial; DLJT:44 of 23 June 1999, which was the lengthy judgment on
the defendant's amendment application, which foreshadowed the giving of
directions, the directions themselves, DLJT:45 (25 June 1999)
to which I have
referred; DLJT:47 of 19 August dealing with the plaintiff's application to
adjourn the trial by two weeks, which
was successful, thus resulting in its
commencement on 15 November; DLJT:48 of 26 October 1999, dealing with what was,
in effect,
the second application by the plaintiff to restructure the trial;
DLJT:51 of 12 November 1999, dealing with pseudonyms.
<P>

40   	The consistent threads through those judgments and the
transcript references made during the course of submissions, are that
availability of counsel has not been a consideration in date fixing; secondly
and more to date, the plaintiff has said that he will
represent himself; and,
thirdly, the repeatedly announced availability of the period from 15 November
1999 to 17 December 1999 for
the hearing of this trial, subject to notified
non-hearing days. Other consistent themes have been of course the magnitude of
the
litigation, the significance of the truth plea, and what I have expressed
at least one if not more than once, the earnest hope that
the plaintiff will
adequately be represented. Consistency is important, but not at the expense of
recognising changed circumstances,
and there have been  changed
circumstances.
<P>

41   	First, as a result of the amendment application, the
appeal of the costs order and proceedings in the Court of Appeal, the
plaintiff's representation status has changed. That was known in August.  In
that context all that has happened is that the plaintiff
has not made
inquiries, on the evidence, as to anyone's availability to be his counsel on
truth, upon clarification of his financial
position, other than the counsel of
his choice who has been in the matter, Mr Barker QC.  It would be imprudent to
speculate as to
the outcome of any inquiry if it had been made.  This is the
principal adverse thing against the plaintiff and the principal thing
upon
which the defendant relies.
<P>

42   	What other changes have there been? In the evidence of Mr
Potter, there is the availability of funds to which I have referred
and the
confirmation of the availability of Mr Barker from 31 January 2000.
<P>

43   	But other things of critical importance have changed.  The
trial before me has been running quite well, with representation,
thus far into
the second last week of term for 1999.  That is a critically important and new
perspective from which to view the history,
at this point of time.  
<P>

44   	The resources of the court are not, in my concluded view,
a real consideration.  Some weeks ago the parties were informed
of the then
rostered time available until May 2000.  Insofar as the expression has been
used that a judge has been "<i>dedicated" </i>to the hearing of this trial,
that has been myself from the first week of 1999, and by "<i>dedicated</i>" I
mean allocated virtually exclusively to hearing the case.  That is the position
that will apply in the year 2000.  The present
application can therefore be
characterised as a "<i>trial in progress" </i>management matter, as distinct
from a case management matter or a court list management issue.
<P>

45   	It has been submitted that court time, in the public
interest, must be responsibly be used.  I agree. "<i>Responsibly</i>" is the
key word.  The public does have an interest in court time being used for the
interests of the overall justice of this case
for both parties at this point,
not in the creation of unfairness or injustice for one party as weighed against
the position of the
other.  On present indications, if the order is made there
will be other matters for the court to deal with, and I mention that merely
in
the context of the exploitation of court resources.
<P>

46   	I have been referred by both sides to what Kirby J said in
<b><i>J L Holdings</i></b>, particularly between pages 170 to 172.  His Honour
concludes his most useful review of relevant principles in relation to
adjournments
and case management considerations as they were thrown up by that
particular case by saying this: from p 172 (7):
<P>

<i>"Whilst taking all of the considerations relevant to the circumstances of
the case into account, the judge must always be careful
to retain that
flexibility which is the hallmark of justice.  New considerations for the
exercise of judicial discretion in such
cases have been identified in recent
years, but the abiding judicial duty remains the same.  A judge who ignores the
modern imperatives
of the efficient  conduct of litigation may unconsciously
work an injustice on one of the parties or litigants generally or on the
public".</i>
<P>

47   	At this point of time, will the interests of overall
justice to both parties, given the respective positions I have identified
on
the evidence, in the orderly fair and sensible conduct of this part-heard trial
before me, be served by an unrepresented plaintiff
being constrained to meet
the truth case in the circumstances I have described it?  Constrained that is
by, over the next few days,
being kept to his position as stated, and known
since August and, vis-a-vis a defendant about whom it can be said that it is
"<i>ready"</i>.
<P>

48   	Given the position of the parties, to force the plaintiff
on, and that is what it amounts to, would be manifestly unfair in
itself.  It
would serve no purpose in the orderly conduct of this part-heard trial before
me and would bring about a situation contrary
to the interests of overall
justice, a situation which that flexibility to which Kirby J referred, can, and
in all the circumstances,
should be, employed to eliminate.  I make order 1 in
the notice of motion.
<P>

49   	In the normal course of events, there would either be an
order for costs made or an argument about costs.  In the normal course
of
events, I would anticipate that an order for costs be to the following effect,
and I am not making it, but that the plaintiff
pay such costs as are thrown
away by reason of the adjournment, that is the defendant's costs, and the
defendant pay the plaintiff's
costs of the contested application.  If there is
to be an issue about costs I will reserve it.
<P>

50   	Costs reserved.
