<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is the hearing of a case stated by
her Worship, Ms Staunton, in the Civil Claims Division of the Local Court at
Sydney, arising
out of a determination by her striking out the plaintiff's
Amended Statement of Claim pursuant to Part 8 rule 3(1) of the <b><i>Local
Court (Civil Claims) Rules</i></b> <b><i>1988 </i></b>which is in the following
form:
<P>

"Where a relevant document:
<P>

(a)	discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the document . . . . .
<P>

the court may at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the whole
or any part of the document be struck out."
<P>

2   	Subrule (2) provides that the court may receive evidence on
the hearing of such an application, and that where it makes an
order under
subrule (1), it make such further order as it thinks fit as to subsequent steps
to be taken in the proceedings, granting
time to any party to file amended
documents, and granting leave to a plaintiff to have judgment entered after the
striking out of
grounds of defence, costs and other consequential orders.
<P>

3   	The rule has a similar ambit to that of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Rules 1970</a></i></b>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Part 15</a> rule 26(1).
<P>

4   	Having struck out the plaintiff's Amended Statement of
Claim, her Worship dismissed the action and also ordered the plaintiff
to pay
the costs of all parties.
<P>

5   	Although the pleadings and a number of other documents
referred to in the Stated Case were not annexed to it, copies were tendered
before me and a number of admissions made.  Although the rule permits evidence
to be called on an application under the rule, an
application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p8" class="autolink_findacts">Part 8</a> rule
3 essentially depends on the form of the pleading, and the issue is whether the
pleading, as pleaded, discloses a reasonable
cause of action: <b><i>Bramson -v-
Rocla Concrete Pipes Limited</i></b> [1982] 2 NSWLR 927 at 941-943.
<P>

6   	The principles on which the jurisdiction under the rule is
to be exercised are authoritatively stated in<b> <i>General Steel Industries
Inc. -v- Commissioner for Railways (NSW)</i></b> (1964) 112 CLR at 125, and
have been repeated in a number of subsequent cases to which it is unnecessary
to refer.
<P>

7   	By its Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiff alleged
that it was the occupier of certain premises, that it entered into
a contract
with the defendants to carry out roof works at the premises, that the works
were carried out and the plaintiff paid for
such work, but subsequently the
roof was removed by wind, as a result, it was alleged, of a breach of implied
terms of the contract,
particulars of which were supplied, whereby the
plaintiff suffered loss and damage.  It was further pleaded, in the
alternative,
that the removal and destruction of the roof was due to the
negligence of the defendants in carrying out the work, and as particulars
of
negligence the same matters were specified as were specified as particulars of
breach of the implied terms of the agreement. 
Particulars which were, in
effect, the particulars of the cost of repairing and replacing the roof, were
set out, totalling $39,574
and that was the amount claimed by the plaintiff.
<P>

8   	By their Amended Notice of Grounds of Defence the
defendants admitted the contract, the carrying out of the works and the
payment.
 They denied that the work was not carried out in a proper or workman
like manner and in accordance with the plans and specifications
prepared by the
plaintiff's architects and under the supervision of the plaintiff as
owner/builder of the premises, and that the
premises had also been inspected
and approved by officers of the relevant local council.  They denied the breach
of any implied terms
of the agreement, admitted that the roof had been
subsequently removed and destroyed by wind, but claimed this was not as a
result
of any breach on their part but due to faulty design and supervision.
In respect of the claim in negligence they denied negligence
and made similar
claims that the removal and damage to the roof was not due to their negligence
but to the faulty design thereof.
<P>

9   	The learned Magistrate gave as her Grounds of Determination
in the Stated Case that having pleaded in the Amended Statement
of Claim that
the plaintiff was merely an occupier and having pleaded no proprietary
interest, it was not entitled to recover, either
in contract or in tort,
damages in respect of structural repairs to the premises claimed and
particularised in the Amended Statement
of Claim.  Accordingly she struck out
the Amended Statement of Claim and entered judgment for the defendants.
<P>

10   	The Amended Statement of Claim alleges a contract for work
and labour between the plaintiff and the defendants, the carrying
out of such
work, payment by the plaintiff for such work and breach of the contract.  Those
facts establish the essential ingredients
of a cause of action in contract.  If
no damages were established the plaintiff would, nevertheless, be entitled to
nominal damages:
see <b><i>Lindgren, Carter and Harland: Contract Law in
Australia</i></b> at para [2106].
<P>

11   	The fact that a plaintiff will only be entitled to nominal
damages does not justify an action being struck out in accordance
with the
principles in<b> <i>General Steel Industries Inc. -v- Commissioner of Railways
(NSW)</i></b>.
<P>

12   	The respondent submits that (as found by the learned
Magistrate) as the plaintiff was only an occupier and did not have proprietary
interest in the premises, it therefore had no interest in the damages allegedly
suffered and claimed.  In fact, there was evidence
before the Magistrate, which
amounted to prima facie evidence that the plaintiff was a monthly tenant of the
registered proprietors.
 This, I would have thought, constituted a sufficient
proprietary interest in any event, but it is not necessary, for present
purposes,
to explore this aspect any further.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff submits that in any event, in this case, if
the plaintiff proves its case, it is entitled to considerably more
than nominal
damages.  The plaintiff entered into a contract for the installation and fixing
of a roof and, according to the evidence,
it paid $9,925 for that work to be
done.  If the roof blew off in a storm and was destroyed, it is at least
arguable that it did
not get what it paid for, but got a defective job worth
something considerably less, or possibly even nothing at all.  Whether it
can
claim the amount specified, namely the cost of fixing a new roof, may be
another matter.
<P>

14   	The defendants refer to what is submitted to be a general
rule in relation to building work, to the effect that the only person
who can
suffer damage or maintain an action for damages for defective work is a person
with a proprietary interest in the building,
and submit that this case does not
fall into any of the recognised exceptions to that rule.
<P>

15   	In my view it is not necessary to look for exceptions to
the general rule, but the plaintiff is entitled to rely on basic
concepts of
contract law.  If a person spends money to have work done and the work is not
done properly, that person has suffered
a loss; he, she or it has not received
what he, she or it has paid for and the loss, and therefore, the entitlement to
damages, is
the difference between what the person has paid for and what the
person has got.  It does not matter in respect of building work
if it is for
work done on the person's own house or that of someone else.
<P>

16   	On behalf of the defendants, I was referred in particular
to<b> <i>Albacruz -v- Albazero</i></b> <b><i>(The Albazero</i></b>)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20774" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC
774</a>, particularly at 845 and to<b> <i>Linden Gardens Trust Limited -v- Lenesta
Sludge Disposals Limited</i></b> [1994] 1 AC 85 where an exception to what is
said to be the general rule has been recognised, at least in England, in
respect of
building cases in the case of valid assignments of the employer's
rights under the building contract.
<P>

17   	However, in another case heard and reported with the
<b><i>Linden Gardens case,</i></b> namely<b> <i>St Martins Property Corporation
Limited -v- Sir Robert McAlpine Limited,</i></b> which involved a claim by the
original employer who under a building contract had since disposed of his
proprietary interest in the
premises, but had not validly assigned the
contract, Lord Griffiths distinguished <b><i>The Albazero</i></b> at 97 and
said:
<P>

"In cases such as the present the person who places the contract has suffered
financial loss because he has to spend money to give
him the benefit of the
bargain which the defendant has promised but failed to deliver.  I therefore
cannot accept that it is a condition
of recovery in such cases that the
plaintiff has a proprietary right in the subject matter of the contract at the
date of breach".
<P>

18   	Lord Browne-Wilkinson decided this aspect of the case on
the narrower ground of an exception to the general rule and, although
the other
members of the House concurred with Lord Browne-Wilkinson's reasons, a number
of them, particularly Lord Keith of Kinkell
at 95 and Lord Bridge of Harwich at
96, expressed sympathy with the broader view of Lord Griffiths, but found it
unnecessary to reach
a firm conclusion on that point.
<P>

19   	The matter has recently been considered by the English
Court of Appeal in <b><i>Darlington Borough Council -v- Wiltshier Northern
Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1994/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] EWCA Civ 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 68</a> and <b><i>Alfred McAlpine Construction Limited
-v- Panatown Limited</i></b> (unreported - 5 February 1998).  In the former
case there had been a valid assignment of the employer's rights to the owner of
the
premises so the case came within the exception relating to building cases
expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, but Steyn LJ at 80
expressed his agreement
with Lord Griffiths' "wider principle" which he described as "based . . . . .
on classic contracts theory".
 Similarly in the <b><i>Alfred McAlpine
Construction Limited case </i></b>the Court of Appeal again found it
unnecessary to consider whether Lord Griffiths' principle should be applied
because, as it was
a building case, it came within the exception approved by
Lord Browne-Wilkinson.
<P>

20   	The matter was referred to in passing by Hunter J in
<b><i>Downie -v- Hashman</i></b> (Supreme Court NSW - unreported - 29 August
1995), but his Honour found it unnecessary to express any concluded opinion on
whether
<b><i>Linden Gardens Trust Limited -v- Lenesta Sludge Disposals
Limited</i></b> [1994] 1 AC 85 represented the law in Australia.
<P>

21   	The most that can be said, therefore, is that the extent
of the exception and whether, apart from the so-called exception,
there is a
broader principle as outlined by Lord Griffiths, is unclear, and courts of high
authority have not finally resolved the
matter.  It was therefore not
appropriate, for the Local Court to strike out an Amended Statement of Claim on
the grounds that it
disclosed no reasonable cause of action.
<P>

22   	This is also related to another issue that arises, to
which I have already referred, which is whether there was sufficient
evidence
to justify a finding that the plaintiff was a lessee of the premises and,
therefore, did have a proprietary interest.  In
all the circumstances this is
not a case where the Amended Statement of Claim should be struck out under the
rule.  The proposed
pleadings could have been tidied up in relation to the
claim in contract, but the Local Court is not a court of strict pleading and
it
should have regard to the real merits of the case rather than dry and expensive
arguments about the form of pleadings.
<P>

23   	As to the case in negligence, I would have thought that
whether possessed of a proprietary interest or not, an occupier who
claims to
have been deprived of a roof over the premises because of what is alleged to
have been the negligent manner in which the
defendant installed the roof, would
be a person who has a sufficient degree of proximity to be owed a duty of care,
and being deprived
of the roof would constitute sufficient damage to justify
bringing an action in negligence.
<P>

24   	Once again, I would have thought, the damages in that case
would not be the cost of replacing the roof, but would be a claim
for
unliquidated damages, and it can fairly be said that the way the Amended
Statement of Claim is drafted it does not make it clear
that it is a claim for
unliquidated damages.  But once again these pleading points could have been
rectified, if anyone considered
it necessary to rectify them, by amendment of
the pleadings.  The Amended Statement of Claim should not have been struck out
and
a judgment should not have been entered for the defendants.
<P>

25   	Another question that may still arise is whether the
proceedings should be amended by joining the registered proprietors as
co-plaintiffs pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> rule 2 of the Rules.  These matters can all be
dealt with in due course.
<P>

(Counsel addressed on costs).
<P>

26   	I answer the question posed in the stated case "yes", I
set aside the orders of the Local Court and remit the matter to that
Court to
be dealt with according to law.  I order the first and second defendants to pay
the plaintiff's costs of the appeal, but
they are to have a certificate under
the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors Fund Act 1951</a></i></b>.  I make no order as to the costs of
the third and fourth defendants.
