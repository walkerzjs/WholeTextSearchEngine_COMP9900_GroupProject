<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>These proceedings relate to the plaintiffs' claimed
entitlement to extension of their lease from the defendant of the land and
buildings
known as the Blackman's Swamp Reserve Trust, formerly the site of the
Springside Public School on the Cadia Road, about 10 kilometres
from Orange,
New South Wales. The City Council is the trustee of the Reserve lands, and at
the time of the more significant events
the land-holding was regulated by Pt
III B of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913.  That Act ceased to have
effect on 1 January
1990, but for present purposes it is sufficient to refer to
it.
<P>

2	     The plaintiffs were unrepresented at the hearing.  The second plaintiff,
Mr Stephen Czipo-Barna, appeared and conducted the
proceedings, of course for
himself, and claimed to do so on behalf of the first plaintiff who did not
attend.
<P>

3	     The plaintiffs' more recent lease, referred to as the Second Lease, is
dated 23 October 1984 and registered V 658145.  They
earlier held a lease
referred to in the pleadings as the First Lease dated 4 June 1980 in which the
lessor was the City Council,
for a term of 20 years from 26 January 1979 at a
nominal rent of $1 a year.  There were onerous covenants in the First Lease
which
required them to renovate and put in order the buildings on the property,
and they did so at considerable expense.  The house on
the property then became
their home and still is.  The Second Lease was expressed to be made in
replacement of the First Lease and
granted a term commencing on 23 October 1984
and terminating on 25 January 1999, that is several months ago.  The Second
Lease contained
an acknowledgment that the plaintiffs had fulfilled their
obligations under clause 4 of the First Lease as regards repair and renovation
of the buildings and certain other obligations relating to clearing the Reserve
Lands.  The plaintiffs continued to hold the property
at a nominal rental of $1
per annum until the Second Lease expired.
<P>

4	     The Statement of Claim sets out a claim based on equitable estoppel or
proprietary estoppel. It appears from the terms of
the Statement of Claim that
it was informed by the propositions stated by Priestley JA in <b>Silovi v
Barbaro</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 466</a> at 472, including proposition 5 which, as
modified by Priestley JA in<b> Austotel Pty Ltd v Franklins Self Serve Pty
Ltd</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 582</a> at  610 is as follows:
<P>

	<i>"For equitable estoppel to operate, there must be a creation or
encouragement by the defendant in the plaintiff of an assumption that
a
contract will come into existence, or a promise be performed or an interest
granted to the plaintiff by the defendant, and reliance
on that by the
plaintiff in circumstances where departure from the assumption by the defendant
would be unconscionable."</i>
<P>

5	     The modification added the reference to an interest to be granted, and
is apposite to this case.
<P>

6	     An aspect of the law of proprietary estoppel of some importance now was
expressed in this form by the learned authors of
Meagher, Gummow and Lehane
<i>"Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies"</i> 3rd Edition, paragraph [1721]:
<i>"...the interest or expectation.... must be one which [the defendant] could
lawfully satisfy...."</i>.
<P>

7	     For land owned by public authorities with statutory controls over their
powers this limitation of proprietary is well borne
out by authority in New
South Wales. In <b>Attorney-General v The Municipality of the Council of
Sydney</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1919/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1919] NSWStRp 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281919%29%2020%20SR%20NSW%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1919) 20 SR NSW 46</a> at 58 Mr Acting Justice Owen, after reviewing a
number of authorities in which observations had been made about the
implications
of statutory regulation of land ownership by the Crown, and
applying<b> Plimmer v The Mayor of Wellington</b>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281884%29%209%20AC%20699" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1884) 9 App. Cas. 699</a>, a
classic case in this field, said:
<P>

	<i>"In all these cases the court held that where the Crown's power of
alienation was not fettered by statute on equity somewhat similar
to that
claimed by the defendant council might be established as against the Crown.  It
seems to me, however, that in cases where
the Crown only has power to alienate
or dispose of Crown lands in accordance with statutory provisions, no Minister
or Ministers
of the Crown could by any Act or Acts create an interest in Crown
lands in any manner which is not authorised by the law, and that
this applies
to any interest which the Crown has power to dispose of (see the observations
of the Chief Justice of the High Court
in O'Keefe v Williams (5 CLR, at
225)."</i>
<P>

8	     The same area of the law was considered by Chief Justice Jordan in
<b>New South Wales Trotting Club Limited v The Council of the Municipality of
Glebe</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1937/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] NSWStRp 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%2037%20SRNSW%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) 37 SRNSW 288</a> at 307 to 309, and his Honour, after referring
again to the classic cases in this field and to other authorities and the
principles
involved, said at 308-309:
<P>

	<i>"Neither of these principles can, however, be applied if the interest
sought to be established against the owner of the land is an
interest which he
has no power lawfully to create: (Attorney-General v Municipal Council of
Sydney 20 SR46."</i>
<P>

9	     The basis in principle of this view appears to me to be the truism that
it is of no value to establish that a person is estopped
from denying that some
particular obligation exists, or that some particular state of facts exists, if
were the obligation or state
of facts to exist, that person would not be able
lawfully to carry out what is required of him.
<P>

10	     The facts of this case, and the evidence in detail of the dealings
between the parties, must in my view be understood to
be heavily overhung by
the restrictions created by Pt III B of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913
on dealings with Reserve Land,
and on the formalities required before there
could be any effectual dealing.
<P>

11	     In both leases the City Council is the lessor, but its limited position
as a Reserve Trustee is expressly set out in the
First Lease, and it appears at
a number of places in the evidence and the pleadings that the parties knew of
it.  There was recurring
advertence in the communications in evidence between
the plaintiffs' solicitors and the City Council to the need to refer to the
Lands Department if anything effectual was to happen. The concept that the City
Council as Reserve Trustee owned the Reserve Land
was true only for limited
purposes established by the provisions of Pt III B, and declared by s 37 X, a
provision difficult to follow,
to the effect that the trustees are deemed to
have a fee simple estate for the purposes only of Pt III B.  I understand the
provision
to mean that operations by trustees in accordance with the Part had
effect as if they had a fee simple estate, but that any operations
which were
not in accordance with Pt III B would not be within that supposition. It is
expressly declared in subs 37 X (2):
<P>

	<i>"The trustees of a reserve are not capable of alienating, charging,
granting leases of, or licences in respect of, or in any way disposing
of the
reserve or any part of the reserve except in accordance with Div 3."</i>
<P>

12	     Div 3 at s 37 J J and following creates an elaborate procedural regime
for obtaining the consent of the Minister to transactions
including leases, and
to preparing leases and bringing them into effect.
<P>

13	     It is plain, in my view, that it is only by following the course so
indicated that anything effectual could happen with
respect to creating a lease
or an entitlement to a lease of Reserve Land, and that without the Minister's
consent obtained in the
prescribed way the City Council could do nothing; it
could not grant a lease which had any effect, and it could not agree to grant
a
lease in any way which was binding on the City Council or the Crown, or in any
sense binding on the land itself.
<P>

14	     In the Statement of Claim a number of allegations are admitted.  These
establish the facts in which the Council is the Reserve
Trustee, and some
history of the constitution of the reserve trust and of the leases.
<P>

15	     The pleadings and admissions in them show that on 18 January 1985 and
again on 13 March 1985, that is after  the Second
Lease had been granted, the
plaintiffs' solicitors asked the City Council to extend the term of the lease
by a period of twenty-five
years. It is alleged (SC para 9) and the City
Council disputes, that the City Council on 13 February 1985 and on 26 April
1985, with
the knowledge and approval of the Crown, offered to extend the term
for a period of ten years so as to expire on 25 January 2009.
 Particulars of
paragraph 9 name two letters which are said to have this effect.  The letter of
13 February 1985 (Exhibit B), advised
the plaintiffs' solicitors:
<P>

	<i>"The Lands Department raises no objection to the term of the lease being
extended for a further ten (10) years ...  It would seem
that this is a
reasonable compromise and if Mr Barna is prepared to accept an extension of
this lesser term, a recommendation to
such effect will be placed before Council
shortly."</i>
<P>

16	     The second letter of 26 April 1985 passes on this information:
<P>

	<i>"The Land Board Office has now advised by letter dated 16th April, 1985
that ...  the Land Board Office is only prepared to agree
to the term of the
Lease being extended for a further ten (10) years ..."</i>
<P>

17	     In my view the terms of these letters in no way constitute an offer to
extend the term of the lease. They must be taken
with the overhanging knowledge
of the limits on what the Council could do, and the officer who wrote the
letters speaks of no more
than a readiness to place a recommendation before
Council.
<P>

18	     Even if they were offers, they would have no effect unless the
plaintiffs accepted the proposal that there be an extension
for ten years or
adhered to it in some way. Quite otherwise, other correspondence in evidence
shows that for some years the plaintiffs
pursued their wish to obtain a much
longer extension, and later moved to a project of obtaining the freehold
itself. There is no
evidence of any clear acceptance by them of the proposal
that there should be an extension of ten years.
<P>

19	     Particulars to paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim also say to the
effect that the Council, or it may be the Crown, acknowledged
that there was an
offer to extend the term for ten years -  <i>"The acknowledgment was oral and
made by Mr M J Boss an employee of the Defendant to the Plaintiffs' then
solicitor Robert Graham
Bloore."</i>
<P>

20	     Mr Bloore did not give evidence in the proceedings and hence did not
affirm that there ever was any such acknowledgment.
 Mr Bloore wrote a letter,
in evidence as part of Exhibit 3, dated 16 October 1991 which opened:
<P>

	<i>"We refer to the discussions between the writer and yourself in regard to
the present lease of the above mentioned premises, including
your
acknowledgment that the present term of the lease has been extended for a
further ten (10) years to the year 2009."</i>
<P>

21	     As the letter was marked <i>"attention Mr Boss"</i>, it  probably meant
that it was asserted that Mr Boss had acknowledged this.  The letter went on to
deal with another subject, obtaining
the freehold title from the Crown and
getting the Council's support in the form of an indication that the Council
would raise no
objection to sale of the reversion and relinquishment of its
trusteeship. The letter concluded by asking that the request be submitted
to
Council for a decision to be made. This project did not go on to any conclusion
and, as far as I see from evidence, no decision
was made.
<P>

22	     The correspondence does not show that the assertion that Mr Boss had
made an acknowledgment was ever expressly denied. On
the other hand the
assertion was made can have very little weight as there are no particulars of
the time or manner or terms of the
acknowledgment.  Mr Bloore does not give
evidence verifying that there was an acknowledgment, and in his letter he only
made incidental
reference to it, quite off the main theme of the letter, and
did not assert that any arrangement about extending the lease term ought
to be
carried any further.
<P>

23	     Mr Boss also did not give evidence, but that is well explained by
evidence of difficulties in arranging his attendance at
short notice. The short
notice was necessary because I made directions for the parties'
evidence-in-chief to be on affidavit, and
the plaintiffs did not comply, and
did not put forward until the hearing either Mr Bloore's own evidence, or any
suggestion that
inferences were to be based on his letters, leaving the
defendant with nothing to reply to until I departed from my direction and
allowed the plaintiffs to put material into evidence otherwise than on
affidavit.
<P>

24	     I see nothing in the circumstances of the correspondence in which it
was the duty of the City Council or of Mr Boss to enter
into a debate on such a
vague suggestion when it was not apparently being relied on; nor do I see any
circumstances which would raise
a constructive admission out of not taking up
debate on the subject at the time.
<P>

25	     It is very improbable that Mr Boss, as a rational person as I must
attribute to him, ever gave the plaintiffs or their solicitor
any assurance
which purported to override or to go  behind or ignore the statutory
procedures.
<P>

26	     As I have no real statement from Mr Bloore of what he claims that Mr
Boss did, I cannot really address closely a finding
on the probabilities of
what he may have said.  There is nothing for him to answer and it is very
unlikely that if he did give any
assurance, the plaintiffs' solicitor, or even
for that matter the plaintiffs themselves would have thought that there was any
effectual
commitment in the absence of the consent of the Minister for Lands.
Knowledge of the statutory context could well have created a
sense of immunity
in which somewhat freer language might have been used than otherwise could have
been used. It is incorrect to concentrate
on the absence of Mr Boss from
evidence.  The key element in a finding about the agreement attributed to Mr
Boss is the absence of
Mr Bloore, and there is very little to show what Mr Boss
was to say or to reply to, if he had attended here and attempted to deal
with
the matter put against him.
<P>

27	     In oral evidence Mr Stephen Czipo-Barna gave evidence of a conversation
which occurred in February 1985 on an occasion when
Mr Boss and the plaintiff
were present. As I understand this evidence it was that Mr Boss said to the
effect (transcript 9 and 10)
that an extension to the lease would have to be a
matter for discussion with Council, that Mr Boss could see no impediment to
guaranteeing
a loan, and that he would put matters in train to extend the term
of the lease by a period of ten years.  Mr Boss said to the effect
that he did
not think at that time that the length of time would be agreeable but he would
submit it to Council nevertheless. This
material, if correct, would not well
bear out the allegation in the particulars, as it could not have been
understood to have been
an offer to extend the term of the lease for ten years.
But further, at a later point in his evidence (transcript 22), the witness
accepted that the conversation which he had on his mind must have taken place
earlier, before acceptance of the Second Lease.
<P>

28	     For these reasons I find that in fact the defendant did not offer to
extend the term of the lease for a period of ten  years
as alleged.
<P>

29	     No offer established by evidence could have given rise to any equitable
estoppel, and of course there has been no agreement,
however informal, by the
defendant for the grant of an extension of the lease. Considerations relating
to the circumstances in which
specific performance of partly performed
agreements for the grant of interests in land may be ordered by the Court are
simply not
raised by the facts; nor indeed, were they raised by the
pleadings.
<P>

30	     It is also alleged in the Statement of Claim paragraph 11 that the
plaintiffs, induced by an assumption formed on the City
Council's conduct that
the term of the lease had been extended, and relying upon the assumption,
incurred expense which they would
not otherwise have incurred.  This is
disputed.  This allegation is apparently continued in the Statement of Claim
paragraph 14,
which alleges to the effect that by reason of that expense the
value of the land has been improved so that it would be inequitable
for the
City Council to re-enter into possession without compensating the plaintiffs
for the improvements. However, in evidence the
second plaintiff accepted that
expenditure on improvements did not go beyond the covenant obligations, which
included obligations
relating to maintenance and repairs, and withdrew the
allegation in the Statement of Claim paragraph 14.
<P>

31	     In these circumstances there can be no finding that even if there had
been some conduct of the City Council giving rise
to an assumption as alleged,
the plaintiffs had acted on that conduct to their detriment, and there can be
no finding that in any
other way it became unconscionable for the City Council
to rely on the absence of any enforceable arrangement.
<P>

32	          The evidence of communications between the parties over the many
years after 1985 when their leasehold relationship
continued appears to me to
show that the plaintiffs long persisted with their attempts to get a 25 years
extension, not a 10 year
lease extension, and then moved to seeking purchase
from the Crown of the freehold.  In the course of this they received some
encouragement
from the City Council to press for a 10 year extension, which at
least at one stage the Lands Office at Orange was prepared to support;
 this
appears from Exhibit D, the Lands Office letter of 25 June 1986.  What the City
Council did was no more than to encourage and
indicate support for an endeavour
by the plaintiffs to get a 10 year extension.  The City Council did not in any
way act the part
of the grantor of the 10 year extension nor, as far as the
evidence shows, did the plaintiffs take up the project of the 10 year
extension
until the very late stage of commencing these proceedings on 7 July 1998, when
the Second Lease had little more than six
months still to run.
<P>

33	     In his evidence at transcript 13 the second plaintiff said to the
effect that by reason of the correspondence and discussions
the plaintiffs had
with the City Council he was of the belief that the term of the Second Lease
had been extended for 10 years. 
When I take this statement with the rest of
his evidence and the findings I have made about those communications, I am of
the view
that there was not a reasonable basis in the defendant's conduct for
him to hold that belief.  His evidence on this subject must
be taken with his
evidence in cross examination at transcript 25 which establishes that he was
aware throughout that it was not up
to the Council to extend the leases, but it
was up to the Lands Board and the Minister for Lands to approve, and that
getting the
Council on side was only one step on the way.
<P>

34	     The Crown and the Minister for Lands are not parties to these
proceedings.  The expressions of support for an extension
of 10 years which
were at one stage given by the Lands Office at Orange did not in any way take
the place of the statutory requirements
for the Minister's consent, and for the
consent to be obtained in accordance with the statutory procedure.
<P>

35	     In my opinion whatever the merits may be and however strong a claim may
be to have the Minister's favourable consideration,
and whatever advice the
Minister may receive from departmental officers, there could be no effectual
dealing with an interest in
Crown land under Part III B unless the statutory
procedure had in fact been followed and the Minister's consent had in fact been
given.  I would think that unless those things had happened there could be no
equitable claim against the Crown, no matter what dealings
had taken place.
However that may be the Crown is not a party and it is even less open to doubt
that there can be no equitable claim
against the City Council as trustee,
unless the statutory course has been followed.
<P>

36	The plaintiffs' principal claims are a claim for a declaration that the term
of the Second Lease has been extended and for orders
requiring this declaration
to be given effect to by variation of the Second Lease.
<P>

37	     There were subsidiary claims, but these were not pressed at the
hearing
<P>

38	     In my opinion the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief claimed.
<P>

39	     The order is:
<P>

	     I give judgment for the defendant with costs.
<P>

I certify that paragraphs 1-39 are the reasons for judgment of the Honourable
Justice John Bryson.
