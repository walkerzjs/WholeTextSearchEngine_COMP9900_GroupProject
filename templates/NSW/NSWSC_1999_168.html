<b><u>070092/96  -  REGINA  v  Anthony Stuart MOFFATT</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT re application for a verdict by direction - see transcript page
197.</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>   This matter has proceeded before me as a Judge sitting
alone.  The Crown has presented its case, subject to the resolution of one
issue.  It sought to tender an interview with the accused which is recorded on
video, and in respect of which there is a transcript
of the ERISP tape, MFI 4.
The argument and ruling on the admissibility of that interview has been
postponed.  The accused, through
Counsel, has foreshadowed a challenge to its
tender on the basis that it was not voluntary. Instead of dealing with that
issue on
the voir dire, it was thought sensible that it be postponed until
after certain medical evidence was given, in the accused's case.
<P>

2	I mention this background because it has some relevance to an application by
the accused at the end of the Crown case for a verdict
by direction.  In
dealing with that application I must, for the moment, assume that the interview
is included in the Crown case and
is available as material which may be
considered in determining the present application.
<P>

3	I indicated at the close of argument that I would dismiss the application and
later provide brief reasons.
<P>

4	The submission is directed to the first count, that is the count of murder.
The issue is one of causation.  The submission was
that there was no evidence
upon which the Crown could establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the actions
of the accused caused
the death of the deceased, Mr Richard James Fyfe.
<P>

5	For the purposes of determining this issue, I must take the Crown case at its
highest.  The question of causation has been described
as one to be determined
by the application of commonsense to the facts, rather than approaching the
issue as a philosophical or scientific
question.  The essential question, in
the context of this case, is whether there is evidence capable of satisfying a
jury, beyond
reasonable doubt, that the actions of the accused accelerated the
death of Mr Fyfe.
<P>

6	 A number of matters, at least on a prima facie level, appear to be clear.
<P>

&#183;	First, Mr Fyfe, who was 43 years of age at the time of his death,
suffered from severe coronary arteriosclerosis, which included
75 percent
stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery.  This was a condition
which may give rise to a spontaneous heart
attack which could be fatal.  It was
also a condition which was capable of being aggravated, were Mr Fyfe subjected
to trauma.
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, Mr Fyfe, the deceased, was, before his death, in an advanced
state of intoxication.  His blood alcohol level at
the time of death was
estimated to be 0.48 g/100 ml.  He was approaching a level where death from the
effects of acute ethanol intoxication
may occur.
<P>

7	The case against the accused substantially depends upon admissions said to
have been made by him, either to neighbours or to the
police.  I need not refer
to all the evidence.  In the ERISP interview, the accused described an incident
which had the following
features.
<P>

&#183;	First, immediately before the incident, he described the deceased, in
terms of his health, as "fine" (Q 179).  He had not
complained of "being crook
or anything".
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, he described a conversation in which the deceased called him a
"mutt", and this in the context of having previously
called him a "dog", and
having been warned not to repeat the insult.
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, the accused, according to the interview, then began striking
the deceased on the chest, a number of blows with the
flat part of a claw
hammer.  He described these blows as being "not soft" (Q 161).  
<P>

&#183;	Fourthly, he described what happened thereafter in these words, and I
quote from MFI 4:  (page 12)
<P>

	"Q91	After you hit, after you hit him ...?
<P>

	A	... I threw the hammer away and then I choked him to death.
<P>

	Q92	O.K.  How long did you hold him around the throat for?
<P>

	A	Wouldn't have been any more than a minute and a half, two minutes.  Then I
... you know, where my hands were around him, my fingers
were down there like
that, and my hands were around him, I just went, I just went crack and that was
it, he was dead.
<P>

	Q93	How do you know ...?
<P>

	A	Nothing much I could do after that.
<P>

	Q94	How did you know he was dead?
<P>

	A	His eyes rolled back in his head and his tongue turned blue.  And he wasn't
breathing.
<P>

	Q95	Was that ...
<P>

	A	Couldn't feel no pulse in his neck."
<P>

8	Elsewhere, in the course of the interview, the following answers were
provided:  (page 13)
<P>

	"Q100  All right.
<P>

	A	His tongue was goin' blue while I was strangling him.
<P>

	Q101  All right.
<P>

	A.  The only thing was he couldn't push me away.
<P>

	Q102  He couldn't push you away?  He ...
<P>

	A	No, no, when I'm coming in on top of somebody, I'm not easy, I'm not an easy
thing to push away.
<P>

	Q103  So he was trying to push you off him?
<P>

	A	He was trying to, but it didn't work."
<P>

9	Dr Christopher Lawrence performed the autopsy.  He provided a report.  The
report, exhibit A, included the following description
of the cause of death:
<P>

	"The combined effects of compression of the neck, blunt force, chest injury
and acute ethanol intoxication."
<P>

10	Dr Lawrence also identified a "significant condition contributing to the
death, but not relating to the disease or conditions
causing it", namely,
"arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease".
<P>

11	Dr Lawrence gave evidence.  He acknowledged that his findings on post mortem
were consistent with a number of possible causes
of death, including death from
a spontaneous heart attack.  Counsel for the accused submitted that the Crown
had not, in these circumstances,
excluded two possible causes of death, namely,
death through a spontaneous heart attack,, and death through the action of a
lethal
dose of ethanol.  However, on the basis of Dr Lawrence's evidence read
as a whole and, in particular, his evidence in re-examination,
I believe there
is evidence that the actions of the accused were the substantial or
significant, or the operating cause, of the death
of the deceased (<b><i>Royall
v R</i> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20172%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 172 CLR 378).</a>
<P>

12	There is evidence upon which a jury could form the view that the Crown has
excluded causes which are unrelated to the accused
 (cf <b><i>Puckeridge v R
</i></b> (CCA, unreported, 2 November 1998)).
<P>

13	As I said on Friday, therefore, I dismiss the application.  The application
can, of course, be renewed once the admissibility
of the ERISP interview has
been determined.
