<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :   </b>The plaintiff sues for relief against the forfeiture of
interests relating to "Round Mountain" a property said to comprise 651.3
hectares
in the Copmanhurst Shire with a plantation of tea trees which produce
leaf for oil.  A Receiver and Manager of the plaintiff was
appointed by a
secured creditor on 24 March 1999.  The defendant granted a lease of the
property to Melacare Industries Australia
Limited in 1993 for a term commencing
on 18 August 1993 and expiring on 30 June 2008. The defendant's title is
largely freehold,
although one part is a permissive occupancy.  The lease was
registered 0871322 and a variation dated 7 September 1995 was registered
0871323.  The defendant granted to Melacare Industries Australia Limited by
Deed dated 17 August 1993 an option to purchase to be
exercised by 30 June 2008
on written notice and payment of $100,000, whereon the property was to be sold
for $1,000,000.
<P>

2	The varied lease and the option were assigned to the plaintiff with the
consent of the defendant by Deed of Assignment of 22 July
1997.  The
plaintiff's obligations were supported by Guarantees of Mr Steven Rose and Mr
Harry Hollis
<P>

3	The plaintiff claims relief against a forfeiture brought about by a notice
delivered by the defendant's solicitors to the plaintiff
on 9 April 1999.  By
claiming relief against forfeiture the plaintiff admits and alleges that the
forfeiture was effective.  The
defendant has since delivered other notices to
deal with some perceived possible defect.  
<P>

4	In Clause 14.1 of the Lease, which deals with default and termination, there
is a provision (Clause 14.1(d)) to the effect that
there is a default if a
Receiver and/or Manager of any of the assets of the lessee is appointed, and in
that case it is provided
that the lessor may:
<P>

	<i>"(ii) (Determination by Notice):  by notice in writing to the Lessee
determine this Lease and from the date of giving such notice
this Lease shall
be absolutely determined;....".</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>These provisions brought about a forfeiture of the leasehold interest
when a Receiver and Manager was appointed; a contractual termination
of a
valuable leasehold with many years to run must be characterised as a forfeiture
of an interest in land.
<P>

5	Clause 14 of the lease brings about termination after appointment of a
Receiver and Manager without the occurrence of any act
or omission of the
lessee, or any breach by the lessee of an obligation; termination can be
effected when the stated conditions exist
without any act, omission or breach
and sub-section 133E(2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act, 1919</a> does not apply.  The
secured creditor has expressed qualified readiness to withdraw the Receiver,
but has not done so.  Withdrawal
would not alter what has happened.
<P>

<b>6	</b>In Clause 10 of the Deed of Option there is a provision to the effect
that if either party has a Receiver and Manager appointed there
has been an act
of default and the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement forthwith
by written notice. I would also characterise
Clause 10 as bringing about a
forfeiture, but in my opinion the jurisdiction to relieve does not extend to
the Option because the
Deed of Option does not create an interest in land.  The
characterisation of an option, even when granted for consideration as in
this
case, as being or not being an interest in land is difficult and the grounds of
the characterisation are sometimes obscure.
 The parties took care to create
the option by a separate transaction and did not annex the option to the lease
or make it run with
the interest of the lessee.  It was a personal right of the
grantee; this is emphasised by the means adopted for the option to be
assigned
in a transaction in which the grantor was a party, in substance a further grant
of an option.  The option conferred no element
of control over the land in the
period before it was exercised; and this is sufficiently explained by the
existence of the lease.
 No aspect of the option as assigned elevates it into a
present interest or distinguishes it from what on its face it is, the grant
of
a contractual right to acquire an interest in the land at the option of the
grantee.  For that reason there is no power to grant
relief on its forfeiture.
The relationship is wholly contractual and takes effect according to its plain
terms and effect at law.
<P>

<b>7	</b>In any event there is no ground upon which relief against forfeiture
of the option ought to be granted, or on which I would exercise
any
discretionary power to do so.
<P>

<b>8	</b>The plaintiff's counsel conceded that the plaintiff has obtained no
proprietary interest pursuant to the option, and told me that
the plaintiff
applies for relief against the forfeiture of the lease only.  In my view this
concession was correct and no event shown
by evidence has created any
proprietary interest relating to the option.
<P>

<b>9	</b>The Court has power to grant Equitable relief against the forfeiture
of interests in land. Where a forfeiture is based on non-payment
of rent,
relief is granted fairly readily, but on a discretionary basis, on the footing
that the right to terminate the lease is
security for payment of the rent.  The
Court's practice in such cases was stated by Hope J in <b>Pioneer Quarries
(Sydney) Pty Ltd v Permanent Trustee Co. of NSW Limited</b> (1970)  2 BPR 9562.

<P>

<b>10	</b>The plaintiff's claim does not relate to non-payment of rent, and is
advanced in the wider context of the power of a Court of Equity
to grant relief
against forfeiture of interests in land which was considered and expounded by
Lord Wilberforce in <b>Shiloh Spinners v Harding </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20AC%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] AC 691</a> at 721-725.
His Lordship's observations at pp 722 and following show that there are two
heads of jurisdiction; one is where the right
to forfeit is essentially to
secure payment of money or where relief is granted on the basis of fraud,
accident, mistake or surprise;
and there is also a debatable area which
includes obligations in leases to repair and other obligations concerning the
condition
of property, covenants to insure, covenants not to assign and cases
of waste.  These observations have established the view that
even in cases
under the second head there is power to grant relief where full compensation
can be made; the power extends to covenants
which were consciously broken, and
is discretionary.  The second head raises much more difficulty than cases where
the lease forfeited
was security for payment of money or cases where some
established ground for equitable intervention has been proved.  In the same
case Lord Simon of Glaisdale stated the jurisdiction of Equity more broadly.

<P>

<b>11	</b>The law as stated by Lord Wilberforce has been authoritatively
accepted in New South Wales; see Kirby P in <b>Minister for Lands and Forests v
McPherson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20NSWLR%20687" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 22 NSWLR 687</a> at 691-693, including the citations at 693
from <b>Legione v Hateley </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20152%20CLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 152 CLR 406.</a>  Meagher JA agreed on this
matter; see 716; and Mahoney JA reached the same conclusion on a different
basis. 
<P>

<b>12	</b>The statutory power to grant relief against forfeiture of leases
created by sub-section 129(2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act, 1919</a> is a discretionary
power; there is no need for a lessee seeking relief to show an equitable ground
for intervention.  To my mind
it is doubtful whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> applies in the
present case, having regard to its application to a right of re-entry or
forfeiture for a breach of any covenant,
condition or agreement in the lease.
In this case the right of termination relied on does not turn upon any act or
omission of the
plaintiff or anything which could be called a breach by the
plaintiff of a covenant, condition or agreement, or a breach capable
of being
dealt with by a notice specifying a particular breach and requiring remedy,
such as is contemplated by sub-section 129(1).
 If the condition in which the
right of termination occurs it occurs irrespective of any act or omission of
the lessee and in circumstances
where there cannot be said to have been a
breach of a condition, or any breach, by the lessee or otherwise.  
<P>

<b>13	</b>The defendant's counsel referred me to observations of Cozens-Hardy M
R in <b>Rose v Spicer </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%202%20KB%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 2 KB 234</a> at 241-242, on legislation generally
similar to sub-section 129 (2):
<P>

<b>	</b><i>"When Parliament in 1881 empowered the Courts to relieve against
forfeiture for breach of the covenants in a lease a wide discretion
was given
to the Court either to grant or refuse relief, having regard to the conduct of
the parties and to all other circumstances,
and in case of relief such terms,
including the granting of an injunction to restrain a like breach in the
future, may be imposed
as the Court in the circumstances thinks fit.  I am
aware of the danger of defining the mode in which discretionary powers of this
nature ought to be exercised.  Yet I think it expedient to attempt to lay down
some general principles.  In the first place the applicant
must, so far as
possible, remedy the breaches alleged in the notice and pay reasonable
compensation for the braches which cannot
be remedied.  In the second place, if
the breach is of a negative covenant, such as not to carry on a particular
business on the
demised premises, the applicant must undertake to observe the
covenant in future, or at least must not avow his intention to repeat
the
breach complained of.  In the third place, if the act complained of, though not
a breach of a negative covenant, is of such a
nature that the Court would have
restrained it during the currency of the lease on the ground of waste, the
applicant must undertake
to make good the waste if it be possible to do so.  In
the fourth place, if the act complained of does not fall under either the
second or the third head, but is one in respect of which damages, other than
nominal, might be recovered in an action on the covenant,
the applicant must
undertake not to repeat the wrongful act or to be guilty of a continuing
breach.</i>
<P>

<i>	In short, subject only to the maxim de minimis, the applicant must come
into Court with clean hands, and ought not to be relieved
if he avows an
intention to continue or to repeat a breach of covenant."</i>
<P>

<b>14	</b>As His Lordship's observations show, the statutory power is
discretionary and the manner of exercise cannot be prescribed by authority
.
The Court's attention is directed toward possible remedial measures, and
remedial measures should be accepted if they can be expected
to be effective,
but not if the lessee can be expected to continue or repeat the breach of
covenant.  His Lordship's attempt to lay
down general principles does not
control the exercise of the discretion, and is not authoritative in New South
Wales.  
<P>

<b>15	</b>If the plaintiff cannot rely on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129</a>, the plaintiff must show some
Equitable ground such as accident or mistake.  There would, I would think, be
such a ground if a Receiver
were appointed in some circumstances which had no
bearing on the lessee's financial responsibility, or on the protection of the
interests
of the lessor the protection of which is the purpose of the power of
termination.  The onus is on the plaintiff to show that its
exposure to
termination was in some sense an accident or a mistake, or that for some other
reason it should be relieved in equity
against it.  This would, I would think,
require that the plaintiff show that it is in a financially sound position and
that the appointment
of a Receiver is not in fact an indication of any
circumstances against which the lessor is in need of protection by terminating
the lease. 
<P>

<b>16	</b>The Court does not have a general power to dispense with the
contractual entitlements of the defendant.  It is necessary to show some
ground
for the grant of equitable relief; one of the classic grounds such as fraud,
accident, mistake or ignorance, or conduct of
the defendant which over-reached
the plaintiff in some way.  It is necessary there should be some basis on
which, proceeding by analogy
to known grounds on which Equitable relief is
granted, the Court should determine that it is unconscionable or inequitable
for the
defendant to rely on its right of termination.  It is not
unconscionable or inequitable to rely on a contractual right of termination.

<P>

<b>17	</b>To entitle the lessor to terminate the lease simply on the
appointment of a Receiver might be thought to be a very strong measure,
but it
is the measure which the parties to the lease adopted.  Its purpose plainly
enough was to protect the lessor against being
held in a continuing
relationship with a lessee which was not financially responsible and was not
able to sustain the relationship.
 The lessor is entitled to take this
protection or let it go, at its choice.  It is conceivable that there might be
cases where it
would be unconscionable for the lessee to determine the lease on
the appointment of a Receiver because the appointment of a Receiver
was not a
signal for any concern about the financial responsibility of the lessee, and
did not indicate any need for the lessor to
protect itself.  For example a
Receiver of some piece of property might be appointed by order of a Court for
some purpose arising
in litigation although the lessee was in a completely
sound financial position.  It is also conceivable that a Receiver of a lessee
in a sound financial position might be appointed in some abuse or oppressive
use of the power of a third party creditor to make the
appointment, and in that
case it might be unconscionable for the lessor to rely on the appointment. 
<P>

<b>18	</b>In the present case however there are very ample grounds for concern
about the plaintiff's financial responsibility and its ability
to bear the
continuing financial burdens which come with the lease.  Mr Nicholls, the
Receiver and Manager, was appointed on 24 March
1999 by Interstate Mortgage
&amp; Investments Pty Limited, which owns a  mortgage debenture registered
under the Corporations Law.
 His evidence shows that the plaintiff is in
default under that debenture.  Mr Nicholls' inquiries were not complete because
he has
not been provided by the Directors of the plaintiff with the books and
records of the company or with a Statement of Affairs, so
his evidence was
given in approximations, but I am satisfied that the approximations are broadly
correct and sufficiently so to be
acted on for the purposes of the proceedings
before me.  
<P>

<b>19	</b>The result of Mr Nicholls' inquiries was that he had established that
the amount due to the first chargeholder was approximately $3.8
million.  The
amount may be somewhat less as the evidence of Mr Rose was that he had reduced
the interest payable to the first chargeholder
by several hundred thousand
dollars.  However that may be, there are still very significant amounts, in the
context of the  plaintiff's
affairs, overwhelming amounts, owing to the first
chargeholder for principal and interest; either over $3 million, or Mr Rose
says
$2.625 million, for principal as well as unpaid interest, and the
plaintiff is in the hands of its first chargeholder for any respite
of payment
of principal.  Mr Rose told me that he expected to pay the outstanding interest
out of the proceeds of cropping tea tree
on the plantation on Round Mountain;
cropping has begun although it has been impeded by rain.  Cropping could well
produce large
sums of cash, depending on the progress of cropping, the rain and
the state of the market for the produce.
<P>

<b>20	</b>Mr Nicholls' evidence also showed that the amount due to a second
chargeholder, Melacare Industries Australia Pty Limited is approximately
$3.1
million.  This represents money payable for the purchase of the lease and the
plantation from the original lessee.  Mr Nicholls'
evidence also showed that
approximately $210,000 was owing to unsecured creditors.  The list of unsecured
creditors on which this
figure was based is not reliable in detail.  Mr Rose's
evidence was to the effect that he had reduced the unsecured creditors to
about
$180,000.  He expected to pay them in the coming weeks from proceeds of the
cropping.  
<P>

<b>21	</b>An unsecured creditor has brought proceedings to wind-up the
plaintiff; after the plaintiff came to terms with the original applicant
those
proceedings have been continued by another unsecured creditor.  On the first
day of the hearing before me, 13 May 1999, the
Registrar adjourned the
winding-up application for two weeks with a view to putting into effect some
arrangement for the satisfaction
of the substituted applicant.  There are many
other unsecured debts and they include many debts which a business which was in
a position
to pay its debts would certainly pay, such as obligations to
Telstra, which has cut off telephone and facsimile services for non-payment,
and obligations to many suppliers whose co-operation the plaintiff must need
continually to conduct plantation operations.  The inference
is clear that the
plaintiff is unable to pay its unsecured debts as they fall due, and is
insolvent; indeed Mr Rose's evidence confirmed
this by showing that he depends
on future cropping operations to meet unsecured debts which have already fallen
due.  
<P>

<b>22	</b>The evidence shows that the plaintiff is not in a financially strong
or stable position, as it has large debts, including capital
debts, and large
sums are overdue for interest on secured debts and also for unsecured debts.

<P>

<b>23	</b>Mr Rose's account of how he proposed to deal with the secured debt
for interest and his unsecured debts and also his obligations yet
to come due
to the plaintiff related to funds which he expects to raise from the cropping
venture now in progress.  His explanation
was to my mind of itself a reasonably
clear demonstration that the plaintiff is insolvent at present.  His plans
assume that there
will be orderly progress of cropping and realisation of cash
for the crop.  Mr Rose also gave evidence of some projects for re-financing
secured obligations; it is obvious that these projects have not advanced to any
concrete position, and that the plaintiff is still
confronted by a first
mortgagee who has appointed a Receiver and a second mortgagee which has sought
repayment.  
<P>

<b>24	</b>It is I think very significant that the plaintiff not only did not
produce in evidence any balance sheet or books of account, but
as Mr Rose's
evidence makes clear, the plaintiff is quite unable to do that; books of
account and a statement of affairs have not
been furnished to the Receiver
appointed as long ago as 24 March, and the task is still before the plaintiff's
accountant to put
the books of account into a position where they can be
delivered to the Receiver.  The substance of the matter is that I have no
detailed knowledge or clear view of the plaintiff's financial position,
although there are a number of indications that it is probably
not in good
order.
<P>

<b>25	</b>The defendant's counsel referred me to the judgment of Starke J in
<b>Direct Food Supplies (Victoria) Pty Ltd v D L V Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1975/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] VicRp 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20VR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) VR 358</a>
and in particular to the following passage at 361:
<P>

<b>	</b><i>"....it emerges quite clearly in my judgment that the plaintiff will
be unable to pay its rent in the future or that if it does, at
the expense of
other creditors, the defendant may well have to disgorge such payments under
winding-up proceedings.  The same might
well apply to any payment I now order
to be made by the plaintiff to the defendant as a condition of giving relief
against forfeiture.
 In the circumstances, it would seem to me to be not only
pointless but also unjust and inequitable to give the plaintiff the relief
sought."</i>
<P>

26	It is not open to me to take exactly the same view as it is not clear that
the plaintiff will be unable to pay its rent in the
future or that the
defendant may well have to disgorge any payments under winding-up proceedings.
The circumstances in which the
plaintiff's financial position is not clear are
not to the advantage of the plaintiff's case; although the plaintiff was under
a
strong and obvious forensic need to establish its financial position and show
that it can bear its present and future obligations,
it did not do so and
indeed the evidence shows that it is not able to do so; its records are not in
a position where they can be
shown to the Receiver.  There actually are
winding-up proceedings pending, and after coming to terms with the first
applicant the
plaintiff is now hoping to settle with the substituted applicant.
There are many other unsecured creditors and there are strong grounds
for my
apprehension that any payments which the defendant receives for future rental
under terms which I might impose may have to
be disgorged, later or perhaps
sooner, under some liquidation or other insolvency arrangement.
<P>

<b>27	</b>In these circumstances it is in my view clear that the plaintiff has
not been making unconscionable use of its contractual entitlement,
but has been
proceeding in an appropriate way to protect itself by terminating the leasehold
of a lessee which is not in a position
to bear the financial responsibilities
which come with the lease.  
<P>

<b>28	</b>The evidence ranges much more widely.  There has been a continuous
history of default and late payment of rent on the part of the
plaintiff since
the assignment.  It is perfectly clear from Clause 4.1 of the lease that rent
is payable monthly in advance on the
first day of each month.  This obligation
was reinforced by the Deed of Assignment, which recorded in Recital L
assurances given
by Mr Rose himself that the plaintiff would pay the monthly
rent on time as well as complying with other matters, and an express
contractual promise by the plaintiff in Clause 2.5 to pay the monthly rent by
bank periodical deduction authority on the first of
each month.  The bank
periodical deduction authority was withdrawn by the plaintiff after one or two
payments, and there has been
a long series of defaults in complying with the
obligation to pay rent at the contracted time.  It is only on rare occasions
that
rent has been paid at the contracted time, the payments have almost always
been late, and there has been a long series of events
in which payment was made
only after delivery of a demand which pre-figured termination action.  
<P>

<b>29	</b>Mr Rose's evidence has made it completely clear that late payment of
rent has been a deliberate policy adopted with the view to obtaining
the
advantage of retaining money for as long as is possible and after obtaining
legal advice which addressed the remedies available
to the defendant in cases
of default.  In my view the plaintiff has adopted an altogether unsatisfactory
approach to the performance
of its contractual obligations, notwithstanding the
undertaking given by Mr Rose himself in the Deed of Option and the emphasis
given
by the Deed of Option to the performance of this obligation.  In this
matter, the importance of which presents itself anew each month,
the plaintiff
is prepared to meet its obligations only under pressure, and only at a time
which suits itself and does not conform
to the defendant's entitlement.  The
adoption by the plaintiff of this policy is a mark of continued financial
difficulty and of
an irresponsible attitude to obligations.
<P>

<b>30	</b>There have been other controversies and litigation between the
parties.  After proceedings based on a claim by the defendant that
the
plaintiff was in breach of a repair covenant relating to internal drainage, the
defendant obtained access to the property for
the purpose of carrying-out
drainage works, with the benefit of an injunction granted by this Court, and
carried them out.  That
is to say, the defendant has had the experience that it
is not able to obtain compliance by the plaintiff with repair obligations,
and
was not able to perform remedial work itself until it obtained an injunction.
The plaintiff made complaints about the quality
and effect of the remedial work
performed by the defendant; these complaints were little to the point, and they
were not shown to
have any substance; the Environmental Protection Agency,
which was set in motion in the matter, at least in part by the plaintiff,
reached the position clearly recorded in correspondence that it did not contend
that the defendant's measures had had an adverse
effect on the environment.
<P>

31	There have been a number of conflicts between the parties arising out of
their relationship under the lease, and the generally
conflictual nature of the
relationship is adverse to its continuance.  There are several matters which
require particular attention.
 The plantation is in a very poor state of
husbandry; a report prepared in May 1997 by Mr Wilkie, an agronomist, shortly
before the
lease was assigned to the plaintiff shows that the state of
deterioration was already advanced, and that large tracts of the plantation
were unproductive.  There is no reason to think that any activity of the
plaintiff has improved the position; it seems to be in much
the same poor state
of husbandry now as it was then.  
<P>

32	Some special arrangements were made on the occasion of the assignment of the
lease to deal with concerns relating to maintenance
and the state of the
property.  Recitals to the Deed of Assignment show that in 1997 the lessor had
delivered a notice requiring
the original lessee to carry-out work and the work
was not carried-out, after which there were a Notice of Determination of the
lease
and litigation relating to its effect, a second Notice requiring works
and another Notice of Determination; and the arrangements
for the assignment of
the lease followed.  Recital L records assurances specifically given by Mr Rose
that the plaintiff would pay
the rent on time and would repair and maintain the
property and otherwise comply with the terms of the lease, and there was an
express
term of the Deed of Assignment that the plaintiff would pay the monthly
rent by bank periodical deduction authority on the first
of each month.  The
second Notice of Breach of Covenant which the lessor had delivered to the
plaintiff's predecessor was annexed
to the Deed of Assignment, and the
plaintiff gave a contractual undertaking to carry-out the work in the second
notice within twelve
months of settlement of the assignment.  
<P>

33	Of seven classes of remedial work set-out in that notice it is quite clear
that the plaintiff has not carried-out four of them,
namely, rebuilding or
replacing a concrete block retaining wall, and three requirements for cleaning
channels and pipes.  Mr Rose
offered an explanation for not having replaced the
concrete block retaining wall; although the explanation was rather elaborate,
the effect of it was that he no longer wished to use the concrete block
retaining wall for loading vehicles, that he now had a timber
loading ramp
elsewhere, and that an expert had told him that the reconstructed retaining
wall would not be useful.  The short position
is that for reasons which he
thought sufficient he decided that the plaintiff would not conform with this
contractual requirement.
 
<P>

34	With respect to cleaning the channels Mr Rose offered an excuse in terms of
a recommendation from an Environmental Protection
Authority officer which did
not constitute a statutory direction, and which later experience shows could be
overcome as the plaintiff
with the assistance of an injunction entered the
property, carried-out work on the channels, and eventually received
correspondence
from the Environmental Planning Authority confirming that no
adverse action would be taken; the officer who communicated with Mr
Rose was
"<i>taken off the case</i>".  In this case too the plaintiff did not conform to
its contractual obligations and did not find means to do so, although such
means
could be found.  A train of unfortunate events has been set off by the
defendant's concern for clearing the channels; Equity litigation
and an
injunction, work done by the defendant to which the plaintiff ought to have
attended in whatever way was proper, and a further
damages claim by the
plaintiff against the defendant as a result.
<P>

35	Other aspects of the relationship under the lease have been very
unsatisfactory, although in money value they could be thought
of as relatively
minor.  The plaintiff has not shown real readiness to conform to its
obligations relating to time of payment of
rent, and this disturbs confidence
that the plaintiff will conform with any other obligations, including
obligations which I might
impose as a term of relief.  There is no history of
ready and uncompelled compliance with the plaintiff's obligation to pay rent.
The plaintiff's counsel offered on its behalf to submit to any terms or give an
undertaking which the Court required for performance
of obligations under the
lease.  I lack confidence that such arrangements would be complied with.
<P>

36	Another matter, small but potentially very serious, is the long course of
difficulties experienced by the defendant in obtaining
evidence of insurance;
Mrs Daley's evidence shows that the plaintiff did not respond in any reasonable
way to its obligations and
engaged the defendant in a long series of
appearances in a Local Court, plainly with the object of deferring or it may be
avoiding
a small obligation, and then did not pay $180 for many months until
one or two days before the hearing.  
<P>

37	In view of the plaintiff's poor record of compliance with obligations I do
not regard it as just to require the relationship
to continue on terms that the
plaintiff comply with obligations under the Lease.  I see little point in
spelling-out in what may
well be a long and complicated order obligations with
which the plaintiff should already comply, and (it may be) embarking the Court
on supervision of them.  If the process is elaborate, or if detailed attention
by the Court is required to obtain compliance with
contractual obligations, it
were better that the relationship were not continued.  
<P>

38	The plaintiff has tenant rights under Clause 19.2 of the Lease which will
ensure that it can realise the current crop notwithstanding
termination.
<P>

<b>39	</b>The history of the relationship of lessor and lessee between these
parties is one of continued and studied breach of obligations by
the plaintiff,
and of continued conflict, involving litigation.  These circumstances strongly
incline me against any discretionary
decision which would have the effect of
continuing the relationship and overriding the contractual right to bring it to
an end. 
In my view my discretion should be exercised against any course which
would compel the defendant to have continued dealings with
the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>40	</b>The proceedings are dismissed with costs.
