<P>

<b>108637/98 - FRANCIS MARTIN AMY v PERMANENT TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED THE
ESTATE OF STEPHEN KAZIMIR POLYAK</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (ex tempore;  revised on 23 August 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff, as the executor named in an undated,
informal, but allegedly testamentary document, seeks a declaration
to the
effect that the deceased, Stephen Kazimir Polyak, prepared the document
intending that it constitute his will;  and consequently
an order that probate
in solemn form of that document be granted to him.
<P>

2  	The summons filed on 16 June 1998 sought those orders in respect
of a typed document, which was Exhibit P1 in the proceedings,
and also a
handwritten document which was Exhibit P2.  However, in submissions, the
plaintiff's counsel took the view that in light
of the evidence, the proper
course was to seek relief in relation to the typewritten document only.
<P>

3  	The typewritten document is unsigned and purports to be the last
will and testament of Mr Polyak, revoking all other wills.
 It purports to
appoint the plaintiff to be executor and trustee.  It gives a neighbour, Anne
Pollard, five percent of the value
of Mr Polyak's real and personal property
and gives a further five percent to the secretary of the Montefiore Home to
benefit the
purposes of that institution. The document then gives the remainder
of Mr Polyak's real and personal property to the plaintiff `in
appreciation of
his kind support in my old age'.  It makes provision for dating, though the
month of February 1998 is typed in, and
leaves a space for signature.  It then
lists the property of the testator and at the bottom of the document, which is
only one page,
there is a direction to `insert in will' at a specified point an
instruction with respect to cremation.
<P>

4  	The handwritten document, which was Exhibit P2, is substantially
similar to the typewritten document, though there are some
differences.  For
example, there is no reference to the Montefiore Home in the handwritten
document, nor to cremation.  There is
no specific provision for dating and
execution in the handwritten document and some of the descriptions of assets
are different.
<P>

5  	In the handwritten document there are two alterations which
appear to have been made with a different ink from the original.
 One of those
alterations changes the name `Ann (sic) Pollard' to `Elisabeth Anne Pollard'
and the other is an addendum with respect
to money invested with the
Commonwealth Bank, which is identical with one of the items in the list of
assets in the typewritten document.
<P>

6  	The evidence concerning the creation and evident alteration of
the handwritten document is extremely slim.  It appears that
the handwritten
document was found by the plaintiff when he searched Mr Polyak's room at the
Montefiore Home shortly after Mr Polyak
died.  He says he found the document in
a closed writing pad in the room and he tore it out of the writing pad.  It is
impossible
to be sure from the evidence before me whether the handwritten
document was created before or after the typed document.  However,
the evidence
does indicate that the handwritten document and the alterations to it are all
in Mr Polyak's handwriting.
<P>

7  	As far as the typewritten document is concerned, the evidence of
Mrs Grossman, a social worker at the Home, is that on 16 February
1998, she had
a discussion with Mr Polyak in which, in effect, it was arranged that he would
make a `draft copy' of what he wanted
to write in his will and bring it to her
two days later.  She says he brought the typed document to her on 18 February
and she read
it then.
<P>

8  	I therefore infer that the typed document was created some time
between the meetings with Mrs Grossman and Mr Polyak on Monday,
16 February
1998 and their meeting on 18 February 1998.  I also find that the typed
document was created by Mr Polyak during that
period using the old typewriter
which, according to Mr Amy's evidence, was always on Mr Polyak's desk in his
room at the Home and
was frequently used by Mr Polyak.
<P>

9  	The typed document was found when Mrs Grossman, the plaintiff and
his wife went to Mr Polyak's room at the Home on Tuesday 24
February 1998, two
days after Mr Polyak died.  The room had been sealed by the Home's staff
immediately after the death.  When they
entered the room Mrs Grossman handed to
the plaintiff an envelope which he then opened. The typewritten document was in
the envelope.
 There is some inconsistent evidence as to whether the envelope
was addressed.  On balance, it is likely that the envelope was not
addressed
and was unsealed, but it was an envelope large enough to contain the unfolded,
typewritten document.  It was on the desk
or bureau in the room.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff's application is made under s 18A of the Wills
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a> (NSW).  Sub-section 18A provides:
<P>

`A document purporting to embody the testamentary intentions of a deceased
person, even though it has not been executed in accordance
with the formal
requirements of this Act, constitutes a will of a deceased person, an amendment
of such a will or revocation of such
a will, if the Court is satisfied that the
deceased person intended the document to constitute the person's will, an
amendment of
the person's will or the revocation of the person's will.'
<P>

11  	Clearly, the typed document is `a document' for the purposes of
the section.  It purports to be a will and to embody testamentary
intentions.
The evidence shows, as I shall indicate, that the contents of the typed
document are the testamentary intentions of Mr
Polyak.
<P>

12  	The critical question in this case, as in other similar cases,
is whether the document, which clearly has not been executed
in accordance with
the formal requirements of the Act since it has not been executed at all,
`constitutes a will of the deceased
person' because `the Court is satisfied
that the deceased person intends the document to constitute the person's
will'.
<P>

13  	The proper construction of s 18A was dealt with by the Court of
Appeal in<b> </b><i>Re Estate of Masters; Hill v Plummer</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR
446.</a>  Although he dissented, Mahoney JA fully addressed the relevant
principles, and the other members of the Court did not disagree or
depart from
his statements of principle.  His Honour said (at 454):
<P>

`Every document which a person prepares or executes is, in the sense here
relevant, intended by him to be something.  It may, for
example, be intended to
be a letter, a personal memorandum, a draft of something to be prepared later,
or a presently operative document.
 The section requires, of course, that the
document to which it refers be of the latter kind.  It must be intended that
the document
be presently operative and be operative as &#180;a will'.'
<P>

14  	After exploring some elements of the concept of a `will', which
are satisfied in the present case, his Honour drew attention
to the requirement
of s 18A that the deceased must have intended the document to constitute his
will and he said (at 455):
<P>

`For the section to operate, the Court must be satisfied that the intention was
that the document operate in the sense to which
I shall refer, as an actual act
in the law. ... 
<P>

There is, in principle, a distinction between a document which merely sets out
what a person wishes or intends as to the way his
property shall pass on his
death and a document which, setting out those things, is intended to cause that
to come about, that is,
to operate as his will.
<P>

A person may set down in writing what are his testamentary intentions, but not
intend that the document be operative as a will.
 This may occur, for example,
in informal circumstances, in a letter, or diary or the like. What is to be
determined in respect of
a document propounded under s 18A is whether, assuming
it to embody the testamentary intentions of the deceased, it was intended
by
the deceased as his testamentary act in the law, that is, to have present
operation as a will.'
<P>

15  	Kirby P (at 452) warned against a `too stringent requirement of
proof' that a propounded document which otherwise clearly embodied
the
testamentary intentions of the deceased constituted his or her will.  In my
view those remarks are not intended to qualify, and
are entirely consistent
with, the remarks of Mahoney JA which I have set out above.
<P>

16  	The New South Wales provision was derived from South Australian
legislation which prescribes a standard of proof higher than
the civil
standard.  In New South Wales, proof that the document was intended to
constitute the deceased's will is on the ordinary
civil standard.  Section 18A
was introduced following recommendations of the Law Reform Commission of New
South Wales in its report,
`Wills - Execution and Revocation' LRC 47 (1986).
Substantial passages from the Commission's report are set out in the judgment
of
Powell J in<b> </b><i>Re Application of Brown; Estate of Springfield</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 535.</a>  Consistently with Mahoney JA's observations set out
above, the Commission (paragraph 6.28) distinguished between a document
prepared
as an instruction to solicitors for the preparation of a will which
was not intended to fall within the proposed section, and a document
which,
though informal, was intended to constitute the deceased's will.  The
Commission observed:
<P>

`We think that it is reasonable that this should be so because testators
sometimes change their mind as a result of legal advice
and we would not wish
to see merely deliberative documents being admitted to probate.'
<P>

17  	In addition to the<b> </b><i>Masters </i>and<b> </b><i>Brown</i>
decisions, counsel for the parties referred me to a number of unreported
decisions of this Court:  <i>Cloon v Allingham</i> (14 December 1990, Needham
J);<b> </b><i>Re Kenkalo</i><b> </b>(23 October 1991, Powell J);<b>
</b><i>Pahlow-Silady v Siladi</i> (21 November 1994, Santow J; on appeal 22
April 1997, Gleeson CJ, Mason P and Powell JA);<b> </b><i>Re Perram</i> (4
April 1995, Santow J); <i>Re Stewart</i> (12 April 1996, Cohen J); and<b>
</b><i>Laurence v Gorman</i><b> </b>(17 November 1995, Simos J).  In my
opinion, those cases depended so much on their facts that they are of only
general assistance
in the present case.  They do not appear to me to add to the
principles of law to which I have referred.
<P>

18  	There is some useful academic literature, which includes an
article by Professor Rosalind Atherton in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%202%20Australian%20Property%20Law%20Journal%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 2 APLJ 68.</a>  To a degree
Professor Atherton's analysis has been superseded by the Court of Appeal's
decision<b> </b><i>Masters</i><b> </b>and, in any event, the distinction which
she identifies in the case law do not appear to me to be critical in this
case.
<P>

19  	In summary, the critical question in this case - whether the
Court is satisfied that Mr Polyak intended the typewritten document,
being a
document which purports to embody his testamentary intentions even though not
executed, to constitute his will - depends
on a close analysis of the facts.
<P>

20  	Mr Polyak was a Hungarian immigrant, who arrived in Australia in
1938.  He was naturalised in May 1946.  When he died on 22
February 1998 he was
87.
<P>

21  	He was a lawyer in Hungary.  There is evidence that he worked
for a firm of Sydney solicitors, Boyce &amp; Boyce, for a short
period in about
1945, but there is no other evidence that he practised law in this country.
According to the plaintiff, Mr Polyak's
main occupation here was as a legal
officer in the New South Wales Public Service, perhaps in the Department of
Lands, until his
retirement in about 1976. There is no evidence of the nature
of his work as a public servant except that he was a legal officer,
and
specifically no evidence that his work involved anything closely comparable to
private legal practice in the area of probate
and wills.
<P>

22  	From at least 1965 Mr Polyak lived at 45 The Boulevard,
Cammeray.  He lived there with his wife, Klara, until she died on 19
June 1982.

<P>

23  	Mr Polyak made a will in favour of his wife in 1965.  Shortly
after she died, he went to the Permanent Trustee Company Limited
to arrange for
a new will to be prepared.  On 25 July 1982 he wrote to the company solicitor
of the Permanent Trustee Company referring
to a previous interview and
instructing him to draw up a will.  The letter set out detailed and precise
instructions with full particulars
of Mr Polyak's assets.  Subsequently, the
deceased made a will dated 3 September 1982, in which he appointed the
Permanent Trustee
Company as his executor and trustee.
<P>

24  	The will required the estate to be divided into 20 equal parts.
The plaintiff was to have one part and John David Pollard,
another neighbour,
was to have one part.  The remaining 18 parts were held for named persons with
addresses in New York.  The evidence
indicates that they are Corinne Kirchner
and Phyllis Endreny (Mr Polyak's nieces), and Richard Endreny (his nephew).
Richard Endreny
has since died and under the terms of the 1982 will, his son,
Ray Endreny, takes in his place.  I should mention, at this stage,
that the
beneficiaries under the 1982 will have been notified as required by Part 78
rule 34E and Form 106E of the Supreme Court
Rules and none of them has elected
to appear at the hearing.
<P>

25  	Mr and Mrs Amy came to know Mr and Mrs Polyak well during the
period beginning in 1965.  The evidence indicates to my satisfaction
that Mr
and Mrs Amy, with great generosity, treated Mr and Mrs Polyak as part of their
extended family.  Thus, when Mr and Mrs Polyak
went overseas for a holiday in
1981 Mr and Mrs Amy drove them to the airport; Mr Amy delivered the eulogy at
Mrs Polyak's funeral
and took Mr Polyak to the funeral; each Christmas Mr and
Mrs Amy gave Mr Polyak a yellow shirt to represent his dedication to cycling;
Mr Polyak's 80th birthday was held at their house and Mrs Amy gave him a watch
which he wore until he died; when Mr Polyak had a
fall they visited him in
hospital daily, shopped for him and took meals to him; they regularly lunched
together; they visited him
at hospital after he suffered a stroke; eventually
they assisted him to gain admission to the Montefiore Home; they regularly
visited
him there on Tuesdays and Saturdays and brought him newspapers and
delicacies, and occasionally took him to lunch;  Mr Amy looked
after Mr
Polyak's financial affairs up to his death pursuant to a power of attorney
granted by Mr Polyak on 10 October 1996;  they
were his principal carers, who
kept watch to ensure that he was properly looked after.  The records of
Montefiore Home treat the
plaintiff as Mr Polyak's next-of-kin and a report
entitled `Social and Human Needs Assessment' describes the plaintiff as Mr
Polyak's
principal carer.
<P>

26  	The evidence concerning Mr Polyak's relationship with his nieces
and nephews is much more sparse.  Mr Polyak was a private
man, who was not in
the habit of discussing his relatives or his contact with them with any of his
Australian friends.
<P>

27  	There are only two items of evidence which show contact between
Mr Polyak and the United States relatives.  One is a copy of
a letter which he
wrote to `Matt', Ray Endreny's son.  The letter was typewritten on 4 January
1995 in response to Matt's request
for help on an assignment which  must have
had to do with the family history.  The letter sets out in some detail
information about
Mr Polyak's father and grandparents.  It does not suggest an
absence of connection or a remote connection between Mr Polyak and his
United
States relatives, but it certainly does not suggest close and regular contact.

<P>

28  	The second piece of evidence is a Christmas card of December
1997, which was sent by Ted Endreny to Mr Polyak, who was referred
to as `Uncle
Pisti'.  Ted Endreny introduced himself as Corinne's nephew and the unofficial
family historian, and sought information
about the family history.  It enclosed
a photograph of various US relatives.
<P>

29  	The plaintiff says that Mr Polyak read him this letter and
stated he did not know `these people'.  That does not demonstrate
to my mind
that Mr Polyak was unaware of the US relatives, but only that he did not
recognise the particular correspondent and some
people in the photograph.
However, it reinforces that while there was some contact with the US relatives,
it could not be described
as either close or constant.  Therefore, there is a
singular contrast between the warmth and depth of the contact with Mr and Mrs
Amy on the one hand and the level of contact with the US relatives on the
other.
<P>

30  	I turn now to the events leading up to the death of Mr Polyak on
22 February 1998.  It is important that they be dealt with
in proper
chronological sequence.  The story starts with a conversation between Mr Polyak
and the plaintiff on 17 February 1997.
 In that conversation Mr Polyak
indicated that he intended to change his will.  The plaintiff observed that the
portion which was
to go to John Pollard should now go to his divorced wife,
Anne, because she continued to provide care and comfort to Mr Polyak. 
The
significance of this conversation is to show the deceased was thinking about
changing his will and I infer that the will he wished
to change was the will of
1982.
<P>

31  	Next, there was a conversation between Mr Polyak and his close
friend, Marianne Ruttkai, before Christmas 1997.  The conversation
is
sufficiently important that I should set it out in full:
<P>

`Polyak: I do not know what to do, Frank and his wife do so much for me.  I
will give them 10 percent of my assets and the balance
will go to my American
relatives.
<P>

 
<P>

Ruttkai: Why do you do that?
<P>

 
<P>

Polyak: They are only relatives, that's the reason [I infer that Mr Polyak
intended to say that they were his only relatives]
<P>

 
<P>

Ruttkai: Why do you do that, why not the other way around?'
<P>

32  	This conversation indicates that by December 1997 Mr Polyak was
thinking seriously and broadly about his testamentary dispositions.
 Mrs
Ruttkai had planted the seed, if it was not already there, that a very
substantial increase in the disposition in favour of
the plaintiff and his wife
should occur.
<P>

33  	Next, there is evidence of a telephone conversation between Mr
Polyak and another close friend, Ernest Challen, on 13 February
1998.  In that
conversation Mr Polyak  indicated that he wished to leave the bigger part of
his estate to Frank and the smaller part
to `the other neighbour' [whom I
assume to be Anne Pollard].  Mr Challen did not discourage this intention, but
strongly advised
Mr Polyak to see a solicitor.  Mr Polyak said that he would
get someone to buy a will form cheaply and would prepare his own will,
but Mr
Challen strongly advised to the contrary.  He reminded Mr Polyak that he would
need two witnesses.  This indicates that by
the second week of February 1998 Mr
Polyak had become quite specific as to changing his will and conferring a very
substantial benefit
on the plaintiff and, at that stage, had formed the
intention to do so without legal assistance.
<P>

34  	Next, on Monday, 16 February 1998, Mr Polyak had a conversation
with Mrs Grossman, to which I have already referred.  He asked
her to obtain a
standard will form from a newsagency so he could change his will.  She did so
and gave the document to him.  He may
have used the will form merely as a
precedent, and it has not subsequently been found.  They then had another
conversation in which
he said that he would make `a draft copy of what I want
to write in this last will and testament' and then that he would run through
it
with her before `writing the final copy of the actual document'.  It was
arranged that there would be a subsequent meeting on
the following Wednesday,
and that meeting occurred.
<P>

35  	However, before he met again with Mrs Grossman, Mr Polyak had a
visit from a friend, Mrs Susan Orlay on 18 February 1998. They
had a
conversation in which Mr Polyak indicated that he was changing his will from
leaving everything to his relatives in America
to leaving it all to the
plaintiff.  He said he had asked the social worker to obtain a will form.  Mrs
Orlay encouraged him to do
so.
<P>

36  	Later on 18 February, Mr Polyak handed Mrs Grossman the typed
document and asked her to `go through this with me now'.  He
said that as he
had no contact with his niece and nephews he wished to leave his inheritance to
the people who have taken care of
him over the last ten years, especially the
plaintiff.  They had taken care of him and he wanted to share his
appreciation.
<P>

37  	Mrs Grossman read the document, assessing it from the point of
view of language and terminology, and told him that it sounded
fine.  She then
suggested that they go together to the Chief Executive Officer of Montefiore,
Mr Richard Gould, to read the document
through and to discuss whether a
solicitor was needed to write up the final copy of the document.  Mr Polyak
agreed.  They then went
to see Mr Gould, who has also given evidence.  Mr Gould
says that he advised Mr Polyak to inform the people handling the will (that
is,
I presume, the Permanent Trustee Company) and that a solicitor should be
involved.  They then discussed how to select a solicitor.
 Mr Gould offered to
talk to Montefiore's solicitor and, after speaking to him, to make arrangements
for Mr Polyak to see a local
solicitor.  Mr Polyak agreed. It is evident from
these conversations that the proposal to involve a local solicitor came from
Mrs
Grossman and Mr Gould rather than from Mr Polyak.  Mr Polyak had already
satisfied himself that the `draft' was properly expressed
in English by having
it checked by Mrs Grossman.
<P>

38  	On 19 February 1998 Mrs Grossman had a further conversation with
Mr Polyak, which is important enough to be set out in full:
<P>

`Grossman: Mr Gould spoke to Mr Freedman [Montefiore's solicitor] who suggested
that you get a solicitor, a local solicitor to draw
up the Will, that you
inform the Permanent Trustee of your intention to change the will.
<P>

 
<P>

Polyak:  Could you please arrange early next week to get a local solicitor to
draw it up for me.  But I need the whole weekend [19
February was a Thursday]
to contact all the  people who I have written in my draft, namely, Mr and Mrs
Amy and Mrs Pollard to check
that I have their correct details and correct
addresses.  I can only do this on the weekend as Frank Amy is away on holidays
and
is returning this weekend.
<P>

 
<P>

Grossman: Let's meet on Monday and make the arrangements.'
<P>

39  	A crucial meeting occurred on 21 February 1998, the day before
Mr Polyak died. Mrs Ruttkai visited Mr Polyak again at the Home
 As the visit
was coming to an end, the following conversation occurred:
<P>

`Polyak: I have changed my will the other way around.
<P>

Ruttkai: Very good, very clever.
<P>

 
<P>

Polyak: I am just waiting for the solicitor and Frank to return from
Queensland.'
<P>

40  	In light of these facts it is necessary for me to apply s 18A,
as interpreted in cases such as<b> </b><i>Masters</i>, and to decide whether,
on the facts, I should be satisfied that Mr Polyak intended the typewritten
document to constitute his will.
 Were it not for the evidence of events from
18 February 1998 until Mr Polyak's death, including especially the evidence
given by
Mrs Ruttkai of the conversation on 21 February 1998, I may well have
found it difficult to reach a conclusion favourable to the plaintiff.
 The
evidence with respect to the period prior to 18 February 1998 is somewhat
ambiguous.  It shows a growing firmness of intention
on the part of Mr Polyak,
beginning in July 1997 with an incipient intention to make a change,
crystallising gradually through Christmas
1997 and into February 1998 - a
change which would confer substantial benefit on the plaintiff and possibly
also his wife, but arguably
not culminating in an intention that any particular
new document should constitute Mr Polyak's will.
<P>

41  	It is quite clear from the evidence that by 18 February 1998 Mr
Polyak had formed the firm intention that the bulk of his estate
should no
longer be left to his US relatives, but should benefit the Amys.  Until that
time, however, there was some ambiguity as
to the specifics.  The evidence
indicates that Mr Polyak was not clear as to whether the principal beneficiary
would be Mr Amy or
Mr and Mrs Amy, nor as to whether his intention was to
exclude the US relatives entirely or to simply reduce their benefit very
substantially,
although he had indicated that he was at least contemplating
excluding them completely.
<P>

42  	It seems to me that the position changed some time between 16
and 21 February 1998.  By 18 February Mr Polyak had produced
the typewritten
document which he handed to Mrs Grossman on that day, which was found in an
envelope in his room after he died. 
The typewritten document indicates a very
specific intention set out unambiguously - namely the intention that, apart
from gifts
to Anne Pollard and the Montefiore Home, the whole of the estate
would pass to the plaintiff alone in appreciation of his kind support.
<P>

43  	It is true that in their conversation on 16 February 1998 both
Mr Polyak and Mrs Grossman contemplated that Mr Polyak would
prepare a `draft
copy' which they would subsequently `go through'.  However, by their meeting of
18 February what had been produced
was a very specific and unambiguous typed
document.  Mrs Grossman approved the document with respect to language and
expression,
thereby removing an obvious reason for Mr Polyak to regard it as a
draft.  While her evidence is that on 19 February Mr Polyak still
referred to
this document as a `draft', it seems to me that in the context in which he used
that word, Mr Polyak regarded the typed
document as expressing his clear and
final testamentary intention, subject only to checking correct names and
addresses and review
by the solicitor.
<P>

44  	When it was suggested by Mrs Grossman, and later by Mr Gould,
that a solicitor become involved, it does not seem to me that
those suggestions
were accepted by Mr Polyak as anything more than suggestions to review drafting
so as to ensure that proper legal
terminology was used.  Specifically, the
evidence does not indicate to me that Mr Polyak agreed to seek legal advice as
to whether
his intentions were appropriate.  Although in their conversation of
19 February 1998 Mrs Grossman advised Mr Polyak to `get a solicitor
... to draw
up the will', what was contemplated was engrossment of the text, perhaps with
changes of legal language, rather than
anything which would affect the content
or finality of the testamentary intentions that Mr Polyak had expressed in the
document.
<P>

45  	The tendency of the evidence of Mrs Grossman and Mr Gould in
that direction is, in my view, confirmed by the evidence of Mrs
Ruttkai.  Mrs
Ruttkai gave oral evidence and was cross-examined.  I was very impressed with
her in the witness box.  She is an intelligent
and alert person who, though she
professed to be deaf, quickly understood the questions put to her and answered
them without even
the slightest hesitation.  When counsel put to her that Mr
Polyak had not said that he had changed his will, she insisted that he
had,
indeed, done so.  Her clear recollection was that he said he had already made
the change, not that he merely intended to do
so at a future time.  I accept
that evidence.
<P>

46  	Counsel for the defendant sought to attack Mrs Ruttkai's
evidence on a number of grounds.  He drew attention to her oral evidence
that
Mr Polyak had said:  `I wrote it down with my own handwriting'.  While I accept
her evidence that Mr Polyak said this, I do
not infer that this was a reference
to the `will' which he told her he had changed.  Document P2 is a handwritten
document which
Mr Polyak may well have been referring to as an intermediate
step towards the preparation of the typewritten document.  
<P>

47  	Counsel for the defendant also drew attention to Mrs Polyak's
affidavit evidence that in the conversation before Christmas
of 1997, Mr Polyak
had expressed an intention to benefit `both Frank and his wife'.  While I
accept that evidence, it is in my opinion
consistent with the text of the
typewritten document and, indeed, the text of the 1982 will.  A provision in
favour of the plaintiff
would undoubtedly benefit his wife.  In light of the
text of the typewritten document, nothing in Mrs Ruttkai's evidence suggests
that Mr Polyak, at any stage, had a firm intention to nominate the plaintiff
and his wife as joint beneficiaries.
<P>

48  	Further, counsel for the defendant drew attention to Mrs
Ruttkai's evidence that Mr Polyak told her that he changed his will
`the other
way around'.  He says that was an obvious reference to the previous
conversation in which she had suggested to him that
instead of giving 10
percent to the friends and 90 percent to the relatives, their situations should
be reversed.  In my opinion,
Mr Polyak's reference `to the other way around'
was merely a general reference to the earlier conversation and was not intended
to
indicate a firm intention to achieve a 90 percent/10 percent split in the
estate.  The most important part of his remark was that
he had changed his
will, thereby treating the typewritten document as a firm and final declaration
of testamentary intention.
<P>

49  	Finally, counsel for the defendant referred to Mr Polyak's
statement to Mrs Ruttkai that he was waiting for the solicitor and
for Frank to
return from Queensland.  In her oral evidence, Mrs Ruttkai said that Mr Polyak
had told her that he would `finalise'
or `complete' the `business' when the
plaintiff returned and the solicitor was consulted.  In my opinion, the
reference to finalisation
or completion of the business is to be understood in
the light of the other evidence which relates to Mr Polyak's intention.  As
I
have indicated, the evidence of Mrs Grossman is to the effect that at the end
of their conversation on 19 February 1998 Mr Polyak
explained that he wished to
check the correct details and correct addresses of Mr and Mrs Amy and Mrs
Pollard.  That kind of checking
cannot affect the completion or finalisation of
the testamentary intention already expressed in the typewritten document.
Further,
as I have indicated, my view of the evidence is that the consultation
with the solicitor was to ensure that the document was in proper
legal language
rather than to seek advice on the content of the intention which the document
expressed.  This distinguishes the present
case from the Law Reform
Commission's hypothetical example.
<P>

50  	It follows, in my view, that by the time he died on 22 February
1998, the deceased had formed the intention that the typewritten
document to
which I have referred constituted his will.  In my opinion, therefore, the
plaintiff's case succeeds.  
<P>

51  	I reject the defendant's contention that on the evidence Mr
Polyak had not finalised his testamentary intention to change the
1982 will.  I
do not agree that the evidence indicates that up to the date of his death Mr
Polyak was open to persuasion with respect
to the alteration of the
testamentary intention contained in the typewritten document, nor do I agree
that the evidence indicates
that there was any change as to the identity of the
persons upon whom he wished to confer benefits, during the period from 18
February
to his death.  While I agree that the onus is on the plaintiff to
satisfy the Court of the ingredients of s 18A, applying as I do
the civil
standard of proof I have reached the conclusion that this onus has been
discharged.
<P>

52  	In reaching my conclusion I have taken into account that Mr
Polyak had been a legal officer and that his friend Mr Challen
reminded him
that his new will should be signed before two witnesses.  But Mr Polyak was an
old man who appears to have regarded
the signing and witnessing as mere
formalities of the same order as checking the addresses of the Amys and Mrs
Pollard and having
the solicitor check the legal language, for he was able to
tell Mrs Ruttkai that he had changed the will before it had been signed.
<P>

53  	I turn finally to the question of costs.  Since, in my opinion,
the plaintiff succeeds, it follows that he is entitled to an
award of costs in
his favour.  Though the question is probably academic, I see no reason why in
the circumstances I should not order
costs on an indemnity basis from the
estate.  The parties concede that the defendant's costs should also be paid out
of the estate
on an indemnity basis.
<P>

54  	The plaintiff has handed up an amended copy of the  summons in
this matter which I initial and date for the purposes of identification.
 I
make the declarations in paragraphs 1 - 3 of that document and the orders in
paragraphs 4 and 5.
