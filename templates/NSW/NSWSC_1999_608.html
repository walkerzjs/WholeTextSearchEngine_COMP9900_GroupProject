<b>2092/99 - MARTIN JOHN GREEN  V  CHISWELL FURNITURE PTY LIMITED (IN
LIQUIDATION)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  By summons filed on 22 April 1999, the plaintiff Mr
Martin Green, the liquidator of the defendant company, sought
an extension of
time under s 588FF(3) of the Corporations Law within which to bring any
application under s 588FF(1) in relation
to any voidable transactions by the
defendant within the meaning of s 588FE.  The application for an extension of
time was urgent
because the three year limitation period expired, for reasons
which appear below, on 1 May 1999.  I therefore heard the application,
ex
parte, on 27 April 1999 and on the same day I made an order extending time
under s 588FF(3) to 1 May 2000, on the basis that I
would deliver my reasons
for judgment later.  I now do so.
<P>

2  	The other relief sought in the Summons, namely that the company
be wound up by order of the Court (ie converting the present
creditors
voluntary winding up into a Court winding up) could not be dealt with until
after the relevant advertising requirements
under the Supreme Court Rules had
been complied with, and so on 27 April 1999 I stood the proceedings over for
further hearing.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

3  	On 1 May 1996 the plaintiff was appointed administrator of the
defendant company.  On 28 May 1996 the second meeting of creditors
of the
company in administration resolved that the company execute a Deed of Company
Arrangement (`DCA').  The DCA was executed by
the company on 4 June 1996.
Chiswell Holdings Pty Ltd and Chiswell Properties Pty Ltd, two related
creditors, were excluded from
participating as creditors under the DCA: see
definitions of `Deed Creditor' and `Directors Interests' cl 1, DCA.
<P>

4  	On 16 October 1998 the plaintiff issued a Report to Creditors as
administrator under the DCA, and convened a meeting of creditors
on 13 November
1998 to consider, amongst other things, a resolution pursuant to s 445C(b) that
the DCA be terminated and that the
company be wound up.  The meeting of
creditors was adjourned to 30 November 1998.  On 30 November 1998 the adjourned
meeting of creditors
resolved to terminate the DCA.  The meeting considered a
resolution that the company be wound up but that resolution was not carried
because of the votes of the related creditors, Chiswell Properties Pty Limited
($1,900,000) and Chiswell Holdings Pty Limited ($175,000),
against the
resolution.  On 1 December 1998 a secured creditor (Howard Finance Ltd)
appointed Mr Prentice and Mr Barilla, as receivers
and managers of the company.
Then on 3 December 1998 a summons was filed by the Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation, a creditor of the
company, in proceedings 4894 of 1998, seeking an
order that the company be wound up and an interim order for the appointment of
a
provisional liquidator.  On 4 December 1998 I made an order appointing Mr
Green provisional liquidator of the company.
<P>

5  	On 17 December 1998 Windeyer J made orders in proceedings 4894 of
1998 for reconvening of the meeting of creditors to re-consider
the winding up
resolution, and (as I shall note below) granted consequential relief under s
447A.  The reconvened meeting of creditors
was held on 21 January 1999 and
resolved that the company be wound up.  Subsequently on 8 February 1999
Windeyer J dismissed the
winding up summons in proceedings 4894 of 1998.  Then
the present proceedings commenced on 22 April 1999.
<P>

<b>Limitation period - the law</b>
<P>

6  	Any application by the liquidator for relief under s 588FF(1) in
respect of voidable transactions by the company under s 588FE
must be made
within 3 years after the `relation-back day', or such longer period as the
Court orders on an application by the liquidator
within that three year
period.
<P>

7  	The expression `relation-back day' is defined in s.9. Its meaning
depends upon when the winding up of a company is `taken to
have begun' because
of Division 1A of Part 5.6.  In the present case, being a creditors voluntary
winding up, sub-paragraph (b) of
the definition in s 9 applies, so that the
`relation-back day' is the day on which the winding up is `taken to have begun'
because
of Division 1A of Part 5.6, the relevant provisions of which are s 513B
and s 513C.
<P>

8  	A voluntary winding up is `taken to have begun', in the ordinary
case, on the day on which the special resolution is passed:
s 513B(e). Where
however the special resolution is preceded by some other form of administration
(eg voluntary administration, or
a deed of company arrangement) then the
winding up is taken to have begun at an earlier date, being usually the date
upon which the
voluntary administration commenced. For example,  s 513B(d)
provides that where the special resolution that the company be wound
up
voluntarily is taken to have been passed because, at a meeting convened under s
445F, the company's creditors:
<P>

(i)	passed a resolution terminating a deed of company arrangement executed by
the company; and
<P>

(ii)	also resolved under s 445E that the company be wound up,
<P>

then the winding up is taken to have begun on the s 513C day in relation to the
administration that ended when the deed was executed.
<P>

9  	In the present case, the meeting of creditors of the company
convened under s 445F (and initially adjourned to 30 November 1998),
passed a
resolution terminating the deed of company arrangement, but the further
resolution (namely that the company be wound up)
was not carried at that
meeting, because of the votes of certain `related creditors' against the
resolution.  However, pursuant to
the orders by Windeyer J on 17 December 1998
in proceedings 4894 of 1998, the meeting of creditors was reconvened to
consider a winding
up resolution, the related creditors were precluded from
voting, and consequential relief was granted under s 447A to the effect
that
the meeting of creditors held on 30 November 1998 be treated for all purposes
as having being adjourned to the time and place
as subsequently notified to
creditors in accordance with the Court orders (namely the meeting reconvened on
21 January 1999).
<P>

10  	The adjourned meeting of creditors on 21 January 1999 passed the
resolution that the company be wound up, and hence the requirements
of s
513B(d) were then satisfied.  That is, at a meeting convened under s 445F
(initially convened on 13 November 1998, then adjourned
by resolution of the
meeting to 30 November 1998, and further adjourned pursuant to Court order on
17 December 1998 to 21 January
1999), the company's creditors:
<P>

(i)	passed (on 30 November 1998) a resolution terminating the DCA; and
<P>

(ii)	(at the adjourned meeting on 21 January 1999) also resolved under s 445E
that the company be wound up.
<P>

11  	It is therefore necessary under s 513B(d) to identify the
`section 513C day'.  The administration that ended under s 435(2)(a)
when the
deed was executed on 4 June 1996 was that which commenced with Mr Green's
appointment on 1 May 1996. Sub-paragraph (a) of
the definition in s.513C is
inapplicable, because when the administration began (i.e. on 1 May 1996) a
winding up of the company
was not then `in progress'. Hence, under s 513C(b)
the `s 513C day in relation to the administration' is the day on which that
administration
began, namely 1 May 1996 (see s 435C(1)(a)).
<P>

12  	It follows that the voluntary winding up of the company is
`taken to have begun' on 1 May 1996, and that this is also the `relation-back
day' for the purposes of voidable transactions under s 588FE(1). 
<P>

<b>Principles governing extension of time application under s 588FF(3) </b>
<P>

13  	Section 588FF(3) does not specify any criteria which the Court
should consider in deciding whether to exercise its discretion
to grant an
extension of time. However, the purpose of the recovery provisions with which s
588FF(1) is concerned  (namely to prevent
depletion of a company's assets prior
to insolvency to the detriment of unsecured creditors) indicates the type of
matters which
should be considered. The question is whether it is reasonable to
allow the liquidator to commence proceedings in a period longer
than three
years after the `relation-back day'. The principal consideration would appear
to be the reason why proceedings have not
been commenced within the three year
period - that is, the explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings.
<P>

14  	The three year limitation period (with the proviso for an
extension of time) was first introduced by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/clra1992225/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporate Law Reform Act 1992</a>,
effective 23 June 1993, following the recommendation of the Harmer Report (see
Australian Law Reform Commission, <i> Report of the General Solvency
Inquiry</i> (Report No.45), para 688).  It is apparent from the Harmer Report
that the purpose of shortening the limitation period (which previously
was six
years) was to place liquidators under more rigorous time limitations for taking
action to recover in respect of voidable
transactions. The justification for
the amendment appears to have been complaints concerning inordinate delays in
commencing proceedings
in respect of voidable transactions, and judicial
observations critical of general delays associated with winding up of insolvent
companies (see AR Keay, <i>Avoidance Provisions in Insolvency Law</i> (1997) at
286, and the authorities referred to in note 127).
<P>

15  	Considerations relevant to the exercise of the Court's
discretion under s 588FF(3) were stated by Finn J in <i>Taylor v Woden
Constructions Pty Ltd</i> (Federal Court, 23/8/98, unreported). The following
propositions, with which I respectfully agree, emerge from that case:  
<P>

(a)	ordinarily, the issues raised on an extension application are threefold:
<P>

(i)	the explanation for the delay in bringing proceedings;
<P>

(ii)	a preliminary review of merits of the foreshadowed proceedings - that is,
an investigation as to whether such proceedings would
be so devoid of prospects
that it would be unfair, by granting an extension, to expose the other party to
the continuing prospect
of suit;
<P>

(iii)	whether the likely actual prejudice resulting from the grant of an
extension is sufficiently substantial to outweigh the case
for granting an
extension;
<P>

(b)	where the liquidator's purpose in seeking the extension of time is simply
to put himself into a position where he can properly
decide whether or not to
bring proceedings, a preliminary inquiry into the merits of any consequent
proceedings may not always be
necessary.
<P>

In the present case there is no evidence of any prejudice which would flow from
granting an extension and so that is not an issue.
<P>

16  	In my opinion, there is a risk that in some cases a preliminary
inquiry into the merits may impose an unnecessary burden on
both the liquidator
and the Court, especially in a case where the circumstances appear to give rise
to complex or disputed questions
of fact and law and the evidence before the
Court is manifestly incomplete. 
<P>

17  	It is significant that s 588FF(3) requires that the application
for an extension of time be made prior to expiry of the limitation
period, in
circumstances where it is unlikely that the Court, if it grants the
application, will be able to proceed immediately to
a hearing of the permitted
proceedings on the merits.  This suggests that a preliminary inquiry into the
merits may often be of limited
utility.  
<P>

18  	In this case, I have formed the view that the plaintiff's
affidavit evidence establishes a proper and sufficient explanation
for the
delay in bringing proceedings.  The intervention of the voluntary
administration and the subsequent deed of company arrangement
prior to the
appointment of the liquidator at the adjourned creditors meeting held on 21
January 1999, has had the effect that instead
of the normal three year period
after his appointment as liquidator, the plaintiff had just over three months
after becoming liquidator,
to commence proceedings or apply to the Court for an
extension.  In addition, the plaintiff has been hampered in carrying out his
investigations by the circumstance that the affairs of the company have been in
the hands of the receivers since December 1998. 

<P>

19  	The purpose of the extension of time in the present case is to
enable the liquidator to conduct appropriate enquiries and investigations
and
obtain necessary legal advice to decide whether or not to bring proceedings.
That process will most likely involve the need to
convene a meeting of
creditors to consider proposals for funding arrangements in respect of any
prospective litigation.  That being
so, I regard it as unnecessary and
premature to embark upon any preliminary inquiry into the merits of any
possible or prospective
proceedings by the liquidator under s 588FF(1).
<P>

20  	I was persuaded by these considerations at the hearing on 27
April 1999 that this was an appropriate case to order an extension
of time of
one year to 1 May 2000, under s 588FF(3), and I made an order accordingly.
