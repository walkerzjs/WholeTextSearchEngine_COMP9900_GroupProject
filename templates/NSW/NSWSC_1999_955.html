<b><u>No. 3 of 1999   Rachel Ann LYNCH  v  The Vessel "BRYANNA"</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:	These proceedings are brought in the Admiralty
List of the Equity Division of this Court.  The plaintiff, Rachel
Ann Lynch
(Rachel), is a citizen of the United States of America.  The defendant, the
vessel "Bryanna" (Bryanna), is a sea-going
yacht registered in the United
States of America with the United States Coast Guard and bears the official
number 645565.  Bryanna
was arrested on 18 February 1999 under a warrant issued
by this Court pursuant to a writ of the same date, filed on behalf of Rachel,
claiming damages in the sum of US $40,651.00 or, alternatively, US$40,000.00
together with interest and costs.  The amount is claimed
as owing under a
mortgage of Bryanna, the mortgagor being Loretta Dawn Reed Lynch (Loretta) who
is named as the "relevant person"
in the writ.  The statement of claim
accompanying the writ sets out the circumstances in which the mortgage debt is
alleged to have
arisen.  I shall refer to these later.
<P>

2   	By her defence, Loretta seeks to impugn the validity of the
mortgage and denies her indebtedness under it.  She also asserts
that she has
an unencumbered title to Bryanna.  Again, I shall refer to these matters later.
It is convenient, at this stage, to
set out, by way of background, facts which
are not in contention between the parties, or which I find to be
established.
<P>

3   	<b>Background</b>
<P>

On 18 February 1995 Loretta married Matthew John Lynch (Matthew), Rachel's son,
at Morro Bay, California in the United States of
America.  Both were interested
in yachts and yachting, as was Rachel.  At the time of the marriage, Loretta
owned a yacht "Gitana".
 Matthew owned a yacht "Rubicon".  Rachel, also, owned
a yacht "Lucky Day".  Matthew was contemplating a round-the-world trip in
Rubicon and was taking steps to prepare the boat for this purpose.  Rachel's
boat was constructed of timber and she was having difficulty
in maintaining it
without help from Matthew.  Accordingly, she sold the boat and had available to
her the purchase money.
<P>

4   	After their marriage Matthew and Loretta decided to
circumnavigate the world in Matthew's boat Rubicon.  They set about further
preparing the boat.  However, towards September 1995 Rachel, Matthew and
Loretta became aware that there was a larger vessel, the
"Mona", for sale at an
anchorage some 350 miles away.  It was generally agreed that this boat would be
a better one for the purpose
and that the price appeared to be reasonable.
Matthew and Loretta did not have funds sufficient to enable purchase of this
vessel.
 Rachel offered to provide the money to enable the purchase to be made,
if the boat was regarded as suitable on inspection and a
purchase price was
agreed upon.  The offer was accepted.  
<P>

5   	I am satisfied that there were some difficulties in the
marriage at this time and that Rachel was concerned as to its stability.
However, Matthew told her that, even if the marriage broke down, he would still
wish to purchase Mona for the purpose of the circumnavigation.
 Loretta was not
a United States citizen and it appears that this fact was accepted as producing
some difficulties in relation to
her being registered as an owner of the boat.
In any event, I am satisfied that Rachel was prepared to lend the money only to
Matthew
and that, having regard to the loan being of a substantial size,
US$30,000.00, she wished that some form of security be provided.
 
<P>

6   	Accordingly, prior to advancing the money, without the
knowledge of Loretta, Rachel and Matthew entered into an agreement (the
first
promissory note).  Rachel was an accountant with some commercial experience.
She drew up the document herself, which was signed
by her and Matthew on 5
September 1995.  The document provided as follows:
<P>

"Sept. 5, 1995
<P>

I agree to loan to Matthew J. Lynch, my son, $30,000 (thirty thousand dollars)
which are proceeds received from sale of my boat,
`Lucky Day' as an initially
interest-free loan so that he can purchase a 38' sail boat, documented name,
MONA, in Moss Landing, CA
if his offer to purchase said boat is accepted under
the following terms.
<P>

1.	If offer not accepted &amp; boat not purchased by Sept. 30, 1995, the
$30,000 is to
<P>

 be returned to me.
<P>

2.	Interest begins to accrue on loan on Nov. 4, 1995 at Wells Fargo Prime Rates
or 
<P>

7%, whichever is lower.
<P>

3.	The loan is a demand loan &amp; is callable at any time by me, Rachel A.
Lynch, or
<P>

		assignee 10 days after notice of demand for repayment.
<P>

4.	If I call the loan &amp; Matt does not have cash to repay me I have the 
<P>

following options.
<P>

		1.	put lien on the 38' sail boat which was purchased with the loan
<P>

			proceeds
<P>

		
<P>

	2.	Take physical possession of the 38' sail boat which was purchased 
<P>

with the loan proceeds &amp; have title transferred to me / have boat, a 
<P>

documented vessel documented in my name.
<P>

	3.	If 2. occurs, Matt agrees to deliver (or have delivered) this boat to a
<P>

		Calif. port of my choice.
<P>

5.	Both parties agree that this loan is the sole &amp; separate liability of
Matthew J. 
<P>

	Lynch and not a gift.
<P>

Agreed upon this 5th day of September, 1995   By:
<P>

	Rachel A. Lynch					Matthew J. Lynch"
<P>

7   	On 8 September 1995 Matthew and Loretta inspected the Mona
and agreed to purchase her for US$32,000.00.  They paid a 10% deposit,
which
came from Matthew's own funds.  They received a receipt in the following
terms:
<P>

"SEPT 8/1995.
<P>

Matt &amp; Loretta Lynch agree to purchase the vessel "Mona" for $32,000.
Jenise Whelan/Vanderworp accepts a 10% deposit for $3,200.
 Jenise is
responsible for obtaining a clear abstract of title.  If for any reason she is
unable to do this the deposit will be refunded.
 Vessel must be in same
condition (as of Sept. 8, 1995) when final paperwork is signed.	
<P>

							Loretta Lynch 9/8/95
<P>

								Matt Lynch     9/8/95
<P>

							Jenise Whelan 9/8/95"
<P>

There is no evidence that Rachel knew of this document, or its terms.
<P>

8   	On 2 October 1995 Matthew, utilising the money provided by
Rachel, completed the purchase of the vessel Mona, which was thereafter
renamed
"Bryanna".  On 16 October 1995 the vessel Bryanna was registered with the
United States Coast Guard, being given the official
number 645565.  Matthew was
recorded as being the owner of the vessel.  It is clear that Bryanna required
restoration and refitting
work, to put her in an appropriate state of readiness
for the projected trip.  
<P>

9   	Between October 1995 and May 1996 Matthew and Loretta
worked on the preparation of Bryanna.  They also worked on Matthew's
boat,
Rubicon, and Loretta's boat, Gitana, with a view to these boats being sold.
Loretta had a debt of $15,500 by way of a student
loan.  Matthew paid this debt
for her.  When Gitana was sold for US$14,000, Loretta gave him this money,
which Matthew accepted in
full satisfaction of the amount he had paid on her
behalf.  Rubicon was not sold before they left on the world trip in May 1996.
Matthew provided Rachel with a power of attorney which would enable her to sell
the boat on his behalf in his absence and, also,
make payments on his behalf.
It appears that the same power of attorney, or a similar one, was given to
Rachel to enable her to make
payments on behalf of Loretta.  
<P>

10   	The work on Bryanna was not completed until May 1996.
Matthew and Loretta had largely exhausted their funds in the doing of
this
work.  The boat had been moved to the Port of San Pedro near Los Angeles for
the work to be done.  In late April 1996 Rachel
drove from Monterey, where she
was then living, to San Pedro to assist the young people in their final
preparations.  She offered
to lend them a further US$5,000 for the purchase of
travellers' cheques and to increase the amount in their bank account in case
of
an emergency.    This offer was accepted and the money provided.  Prior to the
departure, agreement was reached that Rachel would
join Matthew and Loretta in
Tonga and sail with them from Tonga to Australia.  She was to take six weeks
leave from her work, beginning
in October 1996 and return to Los Angeles from
Sydney, by a flight leaving on 6 December 1996.  Matthew and Loretta sailed
from San
Pedro on 6 May 1996.  
<P>

11   	Before flying to Tonga in October, Rachel made certain
payments on behalf of Matthew and Loretta, under power of attorney.
 These will
be referred to later.
<P>

12   	The voyage from California to Tonga was not a success.
Loretta suffered considerably from seasickness.  She was not, unlike
Matthew,
an experienced sailor in the open seas.  As well as being ill, she was
apprehensive at sea.  There were strains on the marriage.
 When Rachel joined
them in Tonga, Loretta made it known that she would probably not continue on
the voyage after they had reached
Australia.  Departure from Tonga for New
Caledonia, the next landfall, was delayed until weather conditions were
favourable for Loretta.
 
<P>

13   	On arrival in New Caledonia, a stop of several days was
made.  On resumption of the voyage, approximately an hour out of the
port,
Loretta was upset by unfavourable weather conditions and, at her request,
Matthew brought Bryanna back into port.  The party
then remained in New
Caledonia for a period of time, during which it became obvious to Rachel that
they could not reach Sydney in
time for her return flight to Los Angeles.
Accordingly, she flew out of New Caledonia to Sydney so that she could catch
the return
flight in time.  
<P>

14   	During the period that the party remained in New
Caledonia, I am satisfied, Rachel became increasingly aware of problems in
the
marriage.  It was plain that the voyage would not continue beyond Australia.
She decided that she would obtain a second promissory
note from Matthew to
cover the amount of US$5,000 which had been advanced in California.  She drew
up the document herself and it
was signed by her and Matthew on 17 November
1996.  It appears that Loretta was not aware of the signing of this document
(the second
promissory note).  The document read as follows:
<P>

"New Caledonia
<P>

November 17, 1996
<P>

	Aboard Bryanna
<P>

I, Matthew J. Lynch promise to repay Rachel A. Lynch the $5000 she loaned us
(Loretta &amp; myself) in April 1996 in San Pedro CA
to purchase travelers
checks &amp; have cash for trip.  I also promise to pay interest on loan at 7%
per annum if this loan is not
repaid in full in six months.
<P>

					Matthew J. Lynch
<P>

I agree to the above terms.
<P>

					Rachel A. Lynch"
<P>

15   	Whilst the three people were in New Caledonia, there was a
heated discussion between Matthew and Loretta, in which Rachel
played a part.
Rachel made a note of the main features of this discussion shortly after it
took place.  There is some conflict of
testimony in relation to it.  This is
understandable, the discussion having been heated, with the result that the
participants tended
to remember those aspects of it which registered most
forcibly with each of them.  In view of the fact that she made the note
referred
to, I am prepared to accept, broadly, Rachel's version.  This was to
the effect that Matthew asked Loretta what was to be done about
Bryanna and all
the money that was owed to his mother from her and that Loretta responded that
she didn't know that Matthew had two
boats and she had nothing.   At this point
Rachel intervened saying "No Loretta, Matt only has "Rubicon".  I paid for most
of "Bryanna"
and I can either take possession or put a lien to force her sale
in order to get my money back.  It's in the promissory note."  She
also
referred to the various amounts that she had provided including the loan of
US$5,000 and expenditures she had made.  Whilst
I accept that Rachel made these
comments or something similar, I am of the view that references to the lien and
the first promissory
note made no significant impact upon Loretta at the time,
in the heat of the discussion.  It is apparent that she was not shown any
document.  She denies having been told of either the lien or the note.  I think
the probabilities are that she was told but that
in the circumstances, the
remarks did not register with her.  Further argument occurred at this time
between Matthew and Loretta
as to the appropriateness of her being paid for
work done on Rubicon and Bryanna.  A figure of US$5,000 was mentioned by
Matthew
as an appropriate payment to her.  This was rejected by Loretta.  She
asserted that Bryanna was her home and that she should receive
something for
that.  The discussion went nowhere and ended with Loretta, in an emotional
condition, isolating herself in the foreward
cabin of Bryanna and refusing to
speak to either Matthew or Rachel.  
<P>

16   	It is clear that, by the time Matthew and Loretta arrived
in Sydney in late December 1996, the marriage had broken down. 
Bryanna was
berthed at a marina at Cammeray, in Sydney, where Matthew and Loretta held
inconclusive discussions about their future,
what to do with Bryanna and the
debts relating to her and what financial arrangements should be made between
them.  I am satisfied
that these discussions were conducted in an air of
mounting hostility.  Some documents were signed but, in the ultimate, no
significance
appears to have been attributed to them.  Accordingly, I do not
set them out in these reasons.  
<P>

17   	Despite the failure of Loretta and Matthew to reach any
overall agreement, I am satisfied that by the time Matthew left Australia
to
return to California in January 1997, there was at least an understanding
between them that Bryanna should be sold and that Rachel
should be paid, from
the proceeds of sale, the money that she had advanced for the boat and the
trip.  There was no agreement between
them, however, as to how any balance from
the proceeds of sale should be divided between them.  Matthew returned to
California in
January 1997, leaving Loretta in charge of and living on Bryanna.
On his return, he visited Rachel where she was living in Carmel,
California.
He told her that Bryanna was up for sale with a broker in Sydney and that he
and Loretta had agreed that, after it was
sold, Rachel would get her money back
first.  He said he was going to get a job and start paying back some of the
money that was
owed.  He then left Carmel and returned to San Pedro where he
lived upon the Rubicon, which had not been sold.  He proceeded to do
work upon
it to enhance its sale prospects.  It was sold in late March 1997.  
<P>

18   	There appears to have been fairly desultory communication
between Matthew and Loretta in the first seven months of 1997. 
There were
telephone conversations and e-mails which produced no agreement between them.
In late May 1997 he sent a long and involved
e-mail to her, in which he
mentioned (inter alia) a proposed split of the "profit" from the sale of the
Rubicon, this being the difference
between the US$42,000, the cost of the
original investment, and the US$52,000 for which it was sold.  He suggested
that each of them
should receive US$5,000 from this profit, her share being "in
recognition of the time, effort and money that you contributed to Rubicon
in
making her ready to go cruising."  There were some complicated suggestions as
to the splitting of any balance from the sale of
Bryanna in Australia after
payment of debts including the debt to Rachel.  He said:
<P>

"I see it as imperative that we pay of (sic) my Mom as quickly as possible if
for no other reason than to eliminat (sic) the interest
payments due her.  The
interest payments on Bryanna are cureently (sic) around 240 dollars a
month."
<P>

19   	He admitted in cross-examination that this statement was
partly untrue.  There was no interest currently being paid to his
mother.
Moreover, I am satisfied that this was the first time that any specific mention
was made to Loretta that interest was payable
to Rachel on the amount of her
loans.  However, I am also satisfied, having regard to the size of the loans,
that she would have
expected that reasonable interest would have been
payable.
<P>

20   	I am satisfied that after receiving this e-mail, Loretta
took legal advice in Sydney from the solicitors who act for her in
these
proceedings.  Those solicitors wrote to Matthew on 31 July 1997 setting out
proposals for the settlement of differences between
them.  Inter alia, the
letter acknowledged that "Brynna (sic) was purchased from money borrowed from
your mother US$32,000" and asserted
that "Each party is jointly responsible to
repay your mother a sum of about AUS$21,000".  
<P>

21   	It does not appear that Matthew responded to this letter.
However, he decided that nothing could be achieved by the continuance
of the
marriage and that he should take proceedings for divorce in California.  I am
satisfied that he did not acquaint Loretta with
his intentions.  Before taking
the proceedings, he had discussions with his mother about the outstanding debt
to her.  This was in
the context that her understanding had been that the boat
was up for sale in Australia and that she would be paid from the proceeds.
 I
should add that I am satisfied that, at least partly because they were living
at a very considerable distance from each other,
there was no regular
communication between Matthew and Rachel.  The discussion was confined to
taking steps to further protect her
interests in respect of the loan.  He told
her that she should register her lien on Bryanna with the U.S. Coast Guard.
After discussing
the matter with Matthew she decided to take this course.
Matthew obtained a registration form from the U.S. Coast Guard Documentation
Centre.  It was called "Application for Filing".  She read it and considered
that the instructions that came with it were not very
informative.  However,
Matthew prepared a document which he headed "Security for Promissory Notes
Documented Vessel `Bryanna'." 
He signed the document as "Grantor" and had it
notarised by Ms Ellen Quinn, a Notary Public.  The document was dated 5 August
1997.
 It made reference to three promissory notes, two of which I have already
mentioned, the third being one dated 9 January 1997 for
amounts that had been
paid under power of attorney by Rachel and which had been drawn up and signed
after his return from Australia.
 This document (the fourth promissory note)
provided as follows:
<P>

"1.  This is an agreement between grantor, Matthew J. Lynch, residing at 6817
Roanoak Pl., Riverside, CA 92506 and grantee Rachel
A. Lynch, residing at 2556
Santa Lucia, Carmel, CA 93923.
<P>

2.  Grantor hereby places the entire value of the vessel "Bryanna", US
documentation number 645565, as security for debts accrued
to grantee.
<P>

3.  As of 8-1-97, the value of the debt secured by this agreement is
$40,651.
<P>

4.  Grantor's liability arises from three promissory notes.  1)  Promissory
note dated Sept. 5, 1995 for $30,000 towards purchase
price of "Bryanna."
Interest accruing at an annual rate of 7%.  B)  Promissory note dated November
17, 1996 for $5000 used to purchase
American Express travelers checks.
Interest accruing at an annual rate of 7%.  C)  Promissory note dated January
9, 1997 for $1174
for debts paid while acting with power of attorney.  Interest
accruing at an annual rate of 7%.
<P>

5.  Grantor acknowledges that grantee has the right to collect promissory notes
on demand.  Grantor agrees to relinquish title to
"Bryanna" if he is unable to
cover the full amount of the promissory notes.
<P>

5.  Certification and Attestation:  I hereby certify that the preceding
information is true and correct.  I attest that I understand
that the US. Coast
Guard will rely on these recitations in securing grantor's debts with the title
on the vessel "Bryanna."

<P>

22   	Having executed this document on 5 August 1997 he posted
it along with the "Optional Application For Filing" document to the
U.S. Coast
Guard office.  He then attended the Superior Court of California at
Riverside(the Californian Court), where he was then
living, and filed the
necessary papers to commence divorce proceedings against Loretta.  He did not
engage a lawyer to assist him
in the proceedings.  I am satisfied that he took
these two steps, in the order that he did, to prevent getting himself into
difficulties
under Californian law which would have restricted him in
encumbering Bryanna after the commencement of proceedings.  I am also satisfied
that his mother was unaware that he was undertaking this course.  
<P>

23   	After commencing the proceedings, Matthew returned to
Australia.  He took with him "the Californian divorce papers" for service
upon
Loretta.  There is conflict in the evidence as to the circumstances surrounding
the service.  In my view, nothing turns on this.
 Service was, in fact,
effected.  There were then discussions as to some settlement of the divorce.
Again there is conflict in the
testimony.  However, I am satisfied that at some
stage Matthew told Loretta that "the lien on Bryanna has been sent to the Coast
Guard".  This statement obviously upset her.  It brought the discussions to an
end, as she wished to seek the advice of her solicitor.
 She did so and, in the
result, she commenced proceedings in the Family Court of Australia for
dissolution and property settlement,
which proceedings were served upon Matthew
whilst he was in Sydney.  He engaged the services of a Sydney solicitor before
returning
to California.  Again there is a dispute in the evidence as to his
intentions in relation to the Californian proceedings.  I consider
that,
whatever words were used, Loretta was left with the impression that
negotiations for the ultimate settlement of their problems
would be conducted
in the context of the Australian proceedings and that the Californian
proceedings would be, at least, placed temporarily
on hold.  
<P>

24   	It appears that, on 25 August 1997, Matthew's solicitor
filed on his behalf in the Australian proceedings an affidavit sworn
21 August
1997 and pleadings described as responses.  After that, unspecified
negotiations occurred between the solicitors, one result
of which was the
filing of certain consent orders on 13 November 1997 with the Family Court of
Australia, one of which provided that
neither party was to sell, mortgage or
otherwise encumber or deal with the Bryanna without the consent of the
other.
<P>

25   	Matthew returned to California later in August 1997.
Thereafter he did in fact continue with the proceedings he had instituted
in
California.  In his affidavit he speaks of preparing the necessary papers and
filing them.  He maintained contact with his solicitor
in Sydney and was
appraised of the course of settlement negotiations.  However, it appears that
he did not inform his solicitor as
to steps he was taking in the Californian
Court.  Before any hearing date was reached in California, he received on 10
September
1997 notification from the U.S. Coast Guard that "the Optional
Application For Filing" which he had forwarded attaching the fourth
promissory
note was "deficient in the fact that promissory notes are not recordable" and
had been rejected.  He was advised that
the deficiency could be corrected in
accordance with the Regulations and that an application to correct would have
to be accompanied
by an instrument which was eligible for filing.  He was
further advised that such an instrument included a Chattel Mortgage or
Preferred
Mortgage.  Ninety days were allowed for the correction of this
deficiency after which "in the absence of correction" the original
application
would be cancelled.  
<P>

26   	He discussed this matter with his mother and the view was
formed that it would be better to obtain the services of a professional
person
to prepare the appropriate documents for lodging.  Rachel made contact with Ms
Donna Jenkins of an organisation known as Maritime
Document Service
Incorporated, which operated a business of preparing such documents for
registration with the U.S. Coast Guard.
 On 21 November 1997 Ms Jenkins
forwarded to Matthew a form of Preferred Mortgage over Bryanna.  This was a
standard form document
containing standard terms to be found in a mortgage.
The document referred to Matthew as the mortgagor and Rachel as the mortgagee.
Bryanna was referred to as the vessel the subject of the mortgage.  The amount
of indebtedness was stated to be US$40,651.00.  The
mortgage required the
payment by the mortgagor of the principal sum together with interest in
accordance with the terms of the attached
promissory note (the fourth
promissory note).  That promissory note was attached to the mortgage.  Matthew
executed the mortgage
on 25 November 1997 and it was forwarded to Ms Jenkins'
organisation for the purpose of its being registered.  Registration was
effected
with the U.S. Coast Guard on 1 December 1997 giving it the status of a
Preferred Mortgage under U.S. law (the Preferred Mortgage).
 It is apparent
that Loretta was not advised of the execution or registration of this mortgage.

<P>

27   	On 17 March 1998 Matthew attended the first hearing in the
Californian Court.  He represented himself.  There was no appearance
by
Loretta.  The transcript of the proceedings is annexed to his affidavit of 28
April 1999.  He was asked by the presiding judge
whether he had made contact
with Loretta.  He said  "I have made telephone calls".  This fact is denied by
Loretta.  Matthew advised
the Court of the existence of the Australian
proceedings, but this topic was not explored.  The Court then embarked upon the
question
of "property division".  The judge was apparently relying upon
documents which had been previously filed by Matthew.  She referred
to "the
community property declaration" as indicating "money loaned by Rachel Lynch".
He was asked whether he had any written documents
showing the debt.  He
responded that he had "a lien that my mother placed on the boat."  The judge
asked to see the document and
enquired how the value of the boat had been
established.  Having regard to the fact that the Preferred Mortgage had been
registered
and that it incorporated the promissory note given in August 1997
(the fourth promissory note) I assume that the document which Matthew
handed up
and referred to as "a lien" was a copy of the Preferred Mortgage.  The
proceedings became somewhat confused.  The Court
proceeded to make orders but
was interrupted from time to time by Matthew on the basis that the Court
appeared to be under a misunderstanding
as to the facts.  He was advised by the
Court that "the general presumption is that everything acquired during marriage
is community
property of the parties."  At a later point the judge said "the
general rule is that if you acquired it during marriage I have to
assume it's
community property until you prove to me otherwise."  These comments were made
in relation to an assertion made by Matthew
that equipment on the boat had been
purchased by him with money that he had before the marriage and that it was
separate property.
 He did not have documents with him to establish this matter
and, on that basis, the hearing was "continued" to give him the opportunity
of
producing such evidence.  He was told to advise Loretta of "the continuance".
There was, however, a "tentative finding that Matthew
would be awarded the boat
as well as the debt."
<P>

28   	Although Loretta complains that she was not advised of the
continuance, it is clear that Matthew spoke to her about the result
because a
conversation occurred, by telephone, in which he advised her that the
Californian Court had awarded him the boat and that
she could buy it from him.
I find the evidence as to communications on this topic confusing.  
<P>

29   	Matthew was to return to the Californian Court on 7 April
1998.  Before that he was in contact with Mr Bell, Matthew's Sydney
solicitor,
who advised him that settlement negotiations were still proceeding in Sydney.
Matthew says that he was told that "terms
of settlement" had been agreed in
principle and that they provided that Bryanna was to be given to Loretta in
exchange for her repaying
the debt to Rachel of US$38,864.00.  This information
accords with a document, in fact dated 7 April 1998, headed "Terms of
Settlement"
and forwarded by Loretta's solicitors to Matthew's solicitors in
Sydney.  It is not clear whether a copy of this document had been
received by
Matthew before he returned to Court on 7  April 1998.  Whether it was or not, I
am satisfied that he had received the
information as to the offer of settlement
and that he was agreeable to it.  When he appeared, again without a lawyer, on
7 April
1998 he told the judge "[t]here has been some changes based on the
Court proceedings in Australia and I would like to ask you today
to change the
way that I asked you to decide.  Loretta is going to keep the boat and I would
ask that she be responsible for the
debts and she's agreed to do that."  The
hearing then continued, rather as it had before, with questions being addressed
to Matthew
based apparently upon documents that had been filed.  The transcript
indicates, in my view, that there was some confusion between
Matthew and the
judge as to the nett value of Bryanna, the judge having misunderstood what
Matthew was putting.  She considered,
at one stage, that the boat had a nett
value of US$42,500 and that is after the loan had been subtracted from its
value.  Matthew
corrected this misapprehension by saying "No, the vessel is
worth approximately $45,000.  The loan I think is worth about $40,000."
 This
led to a re-calculation.  In the result, when a Minute of the Order of the 7
April 1998 issued, Bryanna was awarded to Loretta
but there was no reference to
the US$40,000 debt on the boat.  I am satisfied that as a result of Court
procedures this order was
transmitted to Loretta in Sydney by the Californian
Court.  Quite simply, the order was incorrect.  Although the matter of
Loretta's
receiving the boat plus the obligation to pay the debt on it had been
clearly raised and the Californian Court had been told that
there was an
agreement to that effect, this was not reflected in that Court's order.  
<P>

30   	Unfortunately, this led to problems.  Loretta was
obviously quite satisfied with this order of the Californian Court, when
notified of it.  On her instructions her proceedings for a property settlement
in the Family Court in Sydney were discontinued. 
Indeed, she has maintained in
these proceedings that she has an entitlement to Bryanna unencumbered by any
debt to Rachel, purely
as a consequence of this order of the Californian Court.

<P>

31   	It is difficult, from the evidence, to obtain a clear
picture of the course of events in 1998, in Australia, after Loretta
and her
solicitor were made aware of the Californian Court order of 23 June 1998.  Not
only were Loretta's proceedings for a property
settlement in the Family Court
discontinued but an order was also sought and obtained, on her behalf, that
Matthew be "estopped"
from taking proceedings in relation to property
settlement in the Family Court.  Presumably this order was obtained on the
basis
that he had taken proceedings in the Californian Court, which had
resulted in an order in relation to the matrimonial property. 
It appears that
a hearing had been arranged in Sydney for a date in December 1998.  It appears
that, in all the circumstances, this
hearing was abandoned and Matthew was
ordered to pay Loretta's costs.  That appears to be the final position so far
as Family Court
proceedings in Australia are concerned.  However, the
solicitors remained ready to negotiate.
<P>

32   	It is necessary, now, to consider Rachel's position in
1997 and 1998.  I should indicate that I found Rachel to be an impressive
witness.  I accept her evidence as to her knowledge of matters relating to
Bryanna in these years.  I have already referred to the
circumstances
surrounding the provision to her by Matthew of the fourth promissory note and
subsequently of the Preferred Mortgage.
 She was aware of the registration of
this mortgage with the U.S. Coast Guard by December 1997 and had, indeed, made
arrangements
for its preparation by Ms Jenkins.  Apart from entering into these
arrangements with Matthew, however, she was not kept informed
in any precise
way as to what was occurring between Matthew and Loretta.  In 1997 she was not
living with Matthew.  Indeed, she was
residing at Carmel, some considerable
distance from him, and was not in regular contact.  When he returned from
Australia in January
1997 he had advised her that Bryanna was up for sale and
that she would be repaid the moneys owing to her when the sale occurred.
 On
occasions he told her that he was looking after the matter and would fix
everything up.  At some later stage she was informed
by Matthew that the boat
was now not to be sold and that Loretta was going to buy it and pay out the
loan.  This did not eventuate.
 However, she continued to leave matters in
Matthew's hands.  As indicated, in August 1997 she followed his advice in
relation to
the registration of her security.  
<P>

33   	I am completely satisfied that she was unaware that
Matthew had taken proceedings in the Californian Court in August 1997.
 He did
not tell her.  They were taken in the Court at Riverside, where he was
residing, so that it is quite reasonable that she
would have had no means of
knowing of them, except from him.  Furthermore, I accept her evidence that she
did not become aware of
the proceedings until May 1998.  It was in that month
that she came to Riverside.  She was in the process of changing her abode from
Carmel and moving to the eastern states.  She called in at Riverside to see
Matthew.  She suffered a disabling accident which resulted
in her remaining in
Riverside.  Whilst she was recovering from the effects of the accident, it
appears, she was made aware by Matthew
of the proceedings he had taken in the
Californian Court.  She then knew that the Court had awarded Bryanna to
Loretta.  She was
not aware of the absence from the Court's order of any
reference to the debt owing to her although later in the year, at a time she
cannot clearly remember, she became aware of this.  When she did so she, or her
attorney, Mr Swift, on her behalf, sought that Matthew
arrange for the order to
be corrected.  I shall refer to this later.  I am also satisfied that, at the
time she arranged for the
preparation and filing of the Preferred Mortgage, she
was unaware of the Australian proceedings.  She only became aware of these
proceedings some time in 1998 while she was living in Riverside.  Matthew had
told her nothing about them, whilst she was living
in Carmel.
<P>

34   	Rachel clearly relied upon her Preferred Mortgage on
Bryanna, after seeing the order of the Californian Court.  Obviously
she spoke
to her attorney, Mr Swift, about it and received advice that it would remain
enforceable against the boat, even though
the boat had been awarded to Loretta.
It also appears that she obtained some information that the Customs Department
in Australia
was planning to seize the boat on 1 September 1998, because of
unpaid duties.  She wrote to Loretta, enclosing a copy of the Preferred
Mortgage.  The letter is a lengthy one and is annexure A to her affidavit of 21
July 1999.  I shall not set it out in these reasons.
 It indicated that she had
"retained a maritime attorney to protect [her] interest in Bryanna".  It
contains the following paragraph:
<P>

"As you knew, there was a preferred mortgage on Bryanna.  It was my
understanding that you were going to pay the custom's duty and
send me a check
for $39,500 to release the preferred mortgage so that you could keep Bryanna,
which is why you changed your mind
about selling her even though the broker had
a deposit, etc.  This is why the final divorce decree awarded you the boat.
Loretta,
since the preferred mortgage was attached to Bryanna, it has become
your responsibility.  I am enclosing a copy of the Coast Guard
abstract of
title and the filed preferred mortgage.
<P>

As my attorney assures me after seeing the above information as well as a copy
of the divorce papers, I have a valid claim on Bryanna.
 He has contacted a
maritime attorney in Sydney to begin the process there and all I see is more
$$$ going out to the lawyers, so
I am hoping we can solve this ourselves."
<P>

35   	The reference to the divorce decree awarding Loretta the
boat clearly relates to the information which Matthew had conveyed
to the judge
as to the new arrangements in Australia.  This letter with the accompanying
copy of the Preferred Mortgage was received
by Loretta only shortly after the
copy of the Californian Court order of 23 June 1998 would have been received by
her.  She would,
thus, have been aware at the time her proceedings in Australia
were discontinued, that Rachel was claiming to have a mortgage over
Bryanna of
about US$40,000.  
<P>

36   	In the letter Rachel made an offer for Loretta to pay the
amount of the secured debt by instalments and to have, at Rachel's
expense, an
agreement drawn up by a lawyer "so that there would be no misunderstandings
about the terms."  Other suggestions were
made in the letter as to steps that
could be taken to prevent seizure.  The final paragraph of the letter reads as
follows:
<P>

"You can reach me at Uncle Mike's address in Riverside or at the following
phone number.  where I am staying (909) 683-3527.  You
can call me collect.  I
am no longer in Monterey as I had an accident in May and am now on disability,
until/if I get movement back
in my hand and fingers(nerve damage)."
<P>

37   	It does not appear that Loretta responded to this letter.
She, apparently, took the view that the Californian Court had awarded
her the
boat free of the debt.  Indeed, this view has been advanced on her behalf in
these proceedings.  
<P>

38   	On 16 November 1998 Rachel's attorney, Mr Swift, wrote to
the solicitors acting for Loretta and for Matthew in Australia making
demand
"that the principle obligation of $40,651.00 (U.S) under the ship mortgage,
together with all interest due thereon, be satisfied
immediately."  The
suggestion was made that the vessel be sold under order of the Australian Court
and that the proceeds be used
"to satisfy all liens and obligations so as to
provide the purchaser with clear title; and any balance paid into the registry
of
your court."  It was indicated that Rachel would co-operate in such
arrangements and that "if such an approach is unacceptable, we
will have no
option but to pursue other legal remedies."  It appears that no response was
made to this demand.  
<P>

39   	After a period of what he described as "procrastination,"
Matthew approached the Californian Court in relation to the order
of 23 June
1998.  He had been advised by his Sydney solicitor that negotiations in Sydney
were affected by confusion over the fact
that the Californian Court order made
no mention of the debt on Bryanna.  Eventually, he retained an attorney on 12
January 1999
who filed papers in the Californian Court drawing to the Court's
attention that the transcript of the earlier hearing had indicated
that the
boat and the debt had been awarded to Loretta.  There does not appear to have
been any hearing involved.  The Court ruled
on "The Court's Own Motion" that
"[d]ue to a clerical inadvertence" the previous order was "amended Nunc Pro
Tunc" to delete the
reference to "Bryanne (sic) boat" and add, in substitution,
"Bryane (sic) boat and debt thereon".  When the Californian Court's order
issued on 22 January 1999 the award made to Loretta was shown as "BRYANNA boat,
subject to debt in the amount of $40,000.00 with
Rachel Lynch".  
<P>

40   	It is clear that Loretta was not informed of this approach
to the Californian Court in January 1999.  She was, however, aware
of Rachel's
intention to take proceedings in relation to her security over Bryanna. 
<P>

41   	Against this background, I turn to consider the cases
presented by the parties.  
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's case</b>
<P>

The plaintiff relies upon the promissory notes and the Preferred Mortgage as
giving her security over Bryanna.  It is acknowledged
that the first promissory
note could not have this effect until demand was made.  This demand occurred,
as a result of Mr Swift's
letter, on 18 November 1998.  In my view, there is no
need for the plaintiff to rely this document.  She does not, in fact, do so
in
the writ in these proceedings.  There, reliance is placed upon the Preferred
Mortgage.  As has been seen, this security attaches
the less formal security
prepared and executed by Matthew in favour of his mother over Bryanna in August
1997.  I am satisfied, that
it is the security in this form which is the
subject of the order of the Californian Court when that order speaks of
transfer of
the debt with Rachel Lynch of US$40,000 to Loretta.  It is
convenient in the resolution of these proceedings, to regard the Preferred
Mortgage as constituting the security relied upon.  
<P>

42   	I am satisfied that the relevant Californian law should be
regarded as the governing law of this security.  I have been taken
to relevant
sections of the Californian Commercial Code and am satisfied that it is a valid
security in accordance with Californian
law. Indeed, I do not understand the
defendant to assert any formal invalidity on the part of the Preferred Mortgage
based upon any
failure to comply with relevant sections of the Code or US
Federal Maritime laws.  The defences go to other matters.
<P>

43   	The plaintiff seeks orders, giving effect to the security
and for repayment of the debt.  She relies correctly, in my view,
upon s. 16
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1988115/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 4(2)(a)(iii)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1988115/" class="autolink_findacts">Admiralty Act 1988</a> (Cth) to found her claim against
Bryanna and upon the definition of "mortgage" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1988115/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 3</a> of that Act.
<P>

44   	<b>The defendant's case</b>
<P>

A number of matters have been raised by way of defence.  I deal with them in
the following paragraphs.
<P>

Loretta alleges that there was a firm agreement between herself, Matthew and
Rachel that Rachel's loans should be repaid to her
from the proceeds of sale of
the Rubicon.  Conversely, Loretta alleges there was no agreement that Bryanna
should be subject to the
plaintiff's debt.  She gave evidence of conversations
which she asserts produce this result.  I was not particularly impressed with
Loretta's evidence.  I do not consider that she was seeking to mislead the
Court, but I formed the opinion that her recollection
of events has been
distorted by some fixed ideas as to what the justice of the situation requires,
as she sees it.  Her memory is,
in my view, coloured, to a significant extent,
by wishful thinking.  I prefer the evidence of Rachel where there is conflict.
I am
satisfied that there was some discussion, at an early stage, as to Rachel
selling the Rubicon, under power of attorney and, perhaps,
using those funds to
repay herself.  I am equally satisfied that no legally binding agreement arose
as a result of those discussions.
 I am fortified in this view by the simple
fact that Rachel, even before Bryanna was purchased, sought to give herself
security over
it, in the event of the loan not being repaid.  Furthermore, the
loan was expressly advanced, to the knowlege of Loretta, for the
purpose of
enabling the purchase of Bryanna.  I am also satisfied that Rachel endeavoured
to make this clear to Loretta during the
discussion in New Caledonia although,
as I have indicated, I entertain some doubt as to whether Loretta fully
comprehended what was
being said.  Moreover, it appears from Rachel's evidence
that, to a significant extent, Rubicon had been purchased with money provided
by her and also the refitting of the vessel had been largely financed by her.
As she said, if she had accepted that Rubicon was an
ultimate source of
repayment to her of the money she was advancing for the purchase of Bryanna she
would, in effect, be repaying
herself with her own money.  This defence must
fail.
<P>

45   	It is also claimed, by way of defence, that Loretta became
entitled to Bryanna free of any debt, as a result of the Californian
Court
order of 23 June 1998.  As part of this claim, it appears to be asserted that
the alteration of that Court order was a fraud
upon her, the Court having been
misled into making the alteration.  I do not accept this.  The evidence makes
it quite clear that
the Court, no doubt because of Matthew's appearing without
a lawyer, made a simple mistake in its orders.  When this was drawn to
its
attention, it corrected the judgment of its own motion and made an order "nunc
pro tunc" transferring the debt, along with the
boat, to Loretta.  It is
regrettable that Matthew took so long to obtain the correction of the order.
It appears that Loretta may
have altered her position in relation to the
Australian proceedings, on the faith of the original order.  As to that,
however, I
am inclined to the view that she felt that some mistake might have
been made, especially in light of the offer that had been made,
shortly before,
by her solicitor, that she should receive the Bryanna and pay out the debt to
Rachel.  Moreover, as I have already
indicated, she received Rachel's letter
shortly after receiving the copy of the order.  The letter made it quite plain
that Rachel
regarded Bryanna as being subject to her mortgage debt and that, if
matters could not be resolved, proceedings would be taken.
<P>

46   	Even if it could be asserted that some estoppel might
arise in relation to Matthew's failure to take timely steps to have
the
Californian Court order corrected, this would, in my view, only affect Matthew.
Loretta would have been fully aware of Rachel's
position in relation to the
mortgage, as a result of her letter in August 1998 and Mr Swift's letter in
November of that year.  
<P>

47   	In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that Loretta
cannot rely upon the Californian Court order of 23 June 1998 as giving
her an
unencumbered title to the vessel.  This defence must fail.
<P>

48   	It is not clear to me whether, or to what extent, Loretta
makes a claim based upon the Californian law as to community property
in
marriage.  This is, of course, foreign law.  It has not been proved before me
by the calling of expert evidence or the tendering
of the Statute itself.  It
is clear that Rachel did not regard Bryanna as being the community property of
Matthew and Loretta at
the time she entered into the first promissory note.  I
accept her evidence that she was of the view that because the vessel could
clearly be traced to funds advanced by her to Matthew for the purpose of the
purchase of the vessel in his name only, the boat when
so purchased and
registered did not become community property of the marriage.  I am satisfied
that she held this view up until the
time she was advised that the Californian
Court had, apparently, treated it as community property and made orders
accordingly.  No
argument was put to me that, as a matter of Californian law,
Matthew could not have created a mortgage interest in favour of Rachel
over the
vessel.  What is put, as I understand it, is that some unconscionability
attended the creation of the mortgage, resulting
in Loretta's being able to
assert that Rachel was bound, in equity, not to seek to enforce the mortgage
against Bryanna.  I shall
deal with that submission shortly but, before doing
so, indicate that there is nothing shown in the case, which, in my opinion,
would
indicate that Matthew could not, in law, grant the mortgage interest to
his mother.  
<P>

49   	I am also satisfied that, in so far as it may be alleged
(and I am not certain that it is) that Rachel took the mortgage over
Bryanna
knowing that the boat was community property and was therefore bound in equity
not to take steps which might prejudice Loretta's
community interest, there is
no factual basis for this submission.  I am satisfied, as I have already said,
that Rachel took the
mortgage, in circumstances where she was of the opinion
that the boat was not community property.  Also, I do not accept the submission
that Matthew was Rachel's agent in executing and registering the mortgage so
that his knowledge should be imputed to her.
<P>

50   	It appears to be asserted that reliance cannot be placed
by Rachel upon the mortgage because, at the time it was given, Matthew
was
bound by a rule of the Californian Family Code that, once proceedings had been
commenced in the Court, no community property
of the marriage could be
encumbered or otherwise dealt with by either party to the marriage.  A warning
to this effect appears upon
the Court originating process which is in evidence
before me.  The parties appear to accept that this, indeed, is a rule of
Californian
law and, accordingly, I accept that it is so for present purposes.
In any event, an order in similar terms had been made in the proceedings
in the
Australian Court.  It may be ( I express no concluded view) that Matthew in
granting the Preferred Mortgage after the commencement
of the Californian
proceedings and the making of the order in Australia was in contempt of both
Courts.  I am quite satisfied, however,
that Rachel had no knowledge of the
Court proceedings in either jurisdiction at the time the mortgage was given.
If Matthew's behaviour
could give rise to any equities in favour of Loretta,
those equities would not effect Rachel.  In the circumstances her conscience
would not be bound.  No evidence was adduced before me sufficient to prove that
Californian or United States Federal law contains
principles which could found
a contrary conclusion.
<P>

51   	As I understand it, a final broad defence is sought to be
raised, namely that Matthew and Rachel entered into a conspiracy
to prevent
Loretta obtaining anything from the break-up of the marriage.  It is put that
the giving of the mortgage in respect of
Bryanna was not bona fide but was
entered into with the intent of preventing Loretta from establishing her just
claims to the vessel.
 The facts simply do not support any assertion of this
kind.  It is clear that from the very first Rachel regarded the loan which
she
was providing, with some hesitation, as being repayable, at her option, from
the sale of Bryanna.  The addition to the original
amount loaned of the other
amounts advanced to Matthew and Loretta for the purpose of the circumnavigation
and also for relatively
small payments on their behalf in California, were seen
as debts that could be added to the security.  In the result they were all
incorporated within the security of the Preferred Mortgage.  There was a
suggestion that the mortgage was given without consideration.
 However, it
asserts in its terms the giving and receipt of consideration and no evidence
was given to contradict this.  In the result,
I am satisfied that Rachel, at
all times, wished to have security over Bryanna for the substantial sums that
she had advanced and
that it was to Bryanna that she always looked for the
repayment of the debt in the event that Matthew did not answer the demand for
repayment.  
<P>

52   	I am of the opinion that Rachel has established her claim
to realise the security given by way of the Preferred Mortgage over
Bryanna.
<P>

53   	I consider that all the defendant's defences fail and that
appropriate orders should be made in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

54   	It follows from what I have said that I am not prepared to
make any of the orders sought by Loretta in her cross-claim.  This
cross-claim
must be dismissed with costs.
<P>

55   	In respect of the plaintiff's claim, it has been submitted
that I should make orders which would have the effect of enabling
the plaintiff
to take possession of the vessel Bryanna and exercise her rights under the
Preferred Mortgage.  It is put, I think
correctly, that this approach would
expedite the realisation of the security and improve the prospects of obtaining
a satisfactory
sale price.  Accordingly, I make the following declarations and
orders based upon those proposed by the plaintiff:
<P>

The Court declares that:
<P>

1.	The Preferred Mortgage executed on 25 November 1997 is valid.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff is entitled to take possession of the vessel "Bryanna",
registered in 
<P>

the United States of America and bearing US Coast Guard No. 645565, and its 
<P>

equipment and exercise her rights under the Preferred Mortgage executed on 25

<P>

November 1997.
<P>

The Court orders that:
<P>

1.	The defendant give possession of the vessel "Bryanna", registered in the
United 
<P>

States of America and bearing US Coast Guard No. 645565, and its equipment to

<P>

the plaintiff.
<P>

2.	The cross-claim be dismissed.
<P>

3.	The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the claim and cross-claim.
<P>

The Court directs:
<P>

1.	The Admiralty Marshal to deliver to the plaintiff or her legal advisers in
Sydney 
<P>

the vessel "Bryanna", registered in the United States of America and bearing US

<P>

Coast Guard No. 645565, and its equipment.
<P>
