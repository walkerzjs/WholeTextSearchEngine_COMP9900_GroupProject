<b><u>012978/98 - MARCEL KALFUS t/as MARCEL KALFUS &amp; CO. v SYDNEY
MIDDLETON</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:</b>      This is a case stated by Mr
Morahan, Magistrate, pursuant to s.69(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims)
Act</a></b> 1970.  Before the Local Court the respondent to the present
proceedings, Sydney Middleton, sued the appellant, Marcel Kalfus t/as
Marcel
Kalfus &amp; Co., for damages for negligence.  The Magistrate ordered the
appellant to pay to the respondent the sum of $10,899.00
by way of damages. 
<P>

2   	The facts as determined by the Magistrate are as
follows:
<P>

(1)	The respondent, Sydney Middleton, is a former client of the appellant,
Marcel Kalfus.  The respondent resides at and is owner
of strata title unit No.
5 situated at 39 Bundarra Road, Bellevue Hill (hereinafter called "unit No.
5").  The appellant is a solicitor
practising as a sole practitioner in Darling
Point, New South Wales, under the style "Marcel Kalfus &amp; Co". 
<P>

(2)	On or about 12th June 1989, Mr Mann, the owner of unit No. 3 at 39 Bundarra
Road, Bellevue Hill, carried out building works
(hereinafter called "the
building works") which were not approved by the body corporate of the strata
title units (hereinafter called
"the body corporate").  Unit No. 3 was situated
directly below unit No. 5.  As a result of the building works carried out by Mr
Mann,
substantial structural and internal damage was caused to unit No. 5
(hereinafter called "the damage to unit No. 5").  
<P>

(3)	On or about 4th June 1990, the body corporate issued a Statement of
Liquidated Claim in the Local Court of New South Wales at
the Downing Centre,
Sydney against the respondent for unpaid levies alleged to be owed by the
respondent totalling $4,988.71 (hereinafter
called "the Local Court
proceedings").  
<P>

(4)	On or about 8th November 1990, the respondent attended the appellant's
office to instruct him to defend the Local Court proceedings.
 He also
instructed the appellant to sue for the damage to unit No. 5 which he said was
caused by the building works.  The respondent
informed the appellant that one
of the reasons levies were unpaid was because of the damage to unit No. 5.  Mr.
Julius Mayer ("Mr
Mayer") who was an employed solicitor with the appellant was
assigned to and acted for the respondent in both matters.  
<P>

(5)	On receipt of instructions from the respondent, Mr Mayer immediately
consulted with counsel, Mr. Gary McGrath.  Mr McGrath advised
the respondent
that the respondent's claim for damage to unit No. 5 could be set-off against
the claim against the respondent in
the Local Court proceedings in a
cross-claim.  In accordance with Mr McGrath's advice and on the respondent's
instructions, the appellant
prepared a Defence and a Cross-Claim to the Local
Court proceedings to be filed in the Local Court.  The respondent's claim in
the
Local Court (hereinafter called "the cross-claim") sought damages against
both the body corporate and Mr Mann for the damage to unit
No. 5.  When the
appellant attempted to file the Cross-Claim it was rejected by the Local Court
Registry as the quantum of the claim
in the Cross-Claim exceeded the
jurisdiction of the Local Court.
<P>

(6)	On 28th February 1991, the appellant issued proceedings in the District
Court of New South Wales against the body corporate
and Mr Mann for the same
claim as in the Cross-Claim (hereinafter called "the District Court
proceedings").
<P>

(7)	At the same time, the appellant filed a Notice of Motion in the District
Court seeking to transfer the Local Court proceedings
for unpaid levies to the
District Court and for the body corporate's claim for unpaid levies against the
respondent to be dealt with
and heard together with the District Court
proceedings.  In about August 1991, the appellant ceased acting for the
respondent in
the District Court proceedings and the Local Court proceedings.
At the time the appellant ceased to act for the respondent, the motion
to
transfer the Local Court proceedings had not been dealt with by the District
Court.
<P>

(8)	In about September 1991, the respondent instructed the firm Watson Davey to
take over conduct of the matters and to act on his
behalf.  On 5th October
1991, Mr Mann joined his architect and builders involved in the building works
as third parties in the District
Court proceedings.  Some time prior to
December 1993, Watson Davey ceased acting for the respondent when the
respondent refused to
pay their fees.  
<P>

(9)	On 13th December 1993, the respondent appeared before his Honour Judge
Phelan in the District Court proceedings unrepresented.
 He was directed by his
Honour to serve an Amended Statement of Claim by 17th January 1994.  The
District Court proceedings were
then adjourned for further directions on 11th
March 1994.  
<P>

(10)	The respondent himself prepared an Amended Statement of Claim in the
District Court proceedings and on or before 17th January
1994 filed it in the
District Court Registry but did not serve it.  The Amended Statement of Claim
filed by the respondent only named
the body corporate as a defendant in the
action but did not name the other existing defendant, Mr Mann, nor the third
parties joined
by Mr Mann.  
<P>

(11)	The respondent again appeared before his Honour Judge Phelan in the
District Court proceedings unrepresented on 11th March
1994.  His Honour noted
that the Amended Statement of Claim filed by the respondent omitted naming Mr
Mann as a defendant in the
action and drew the respondent's attention to the
omission.  The respondent affirmed his intention to discontinue the action
against
Mr Mann.  As a result, court orders were sought against him by Mr Mann
and the third parties.  Judge Phelan made an order for the
respondent to pay
the costs of Mr Mann and a Bullock order for the respondent to pay the costs of
the third parties joined in the
proceedings by Mr Mann.
<P>

(12)	The total costs ordered to be paid pursuant to the order of Judge Phelan
on 11th March 1994 were taxed and amounted to $21,798.48.
 These costs
comprised the damages sought by the respondent against the appellant in this
action.  After the respondent discontinued
the District Court proceedings
against Mr Mann, the body corporate, as the remaining defendant in the District
Court proceedings,
joined Mr Mann as a third party and, in turn, Mr Mann again
joined his builder and architect as fourth parties in the District Court
proceedings.
<P>

(13)	The District Court proceedings settled in November 1995.  
<P>

3   	Annexed to the Stated Case were the transcript of the
proceedings together with his Worship's Judgment  and a number of the
exhibits.
<P>

4   	The Magistrate determined:
<P>

1.	As the body corporate was the owner of the structural wall it was the body
corporate which had suffered damage and not the respondent.
 The appellant
should therefore not have initiated proceedings on the respondent's behalf as
it did in the District Court.
<P>

2.	The respondent should not have amended the Statement of Claim as he did and
discontinue the action against Mr Mann without first
obtaining legal advice or
obtaining representation in the District Court before his Honour Judge Phelan.

<P>

3.	The appellant was partly responsible for the respondent's loss and the
respondent was partly responsible for his own loss.  They
were more or less
equally responsible for the cost orders made against the respondent.
<P>

5   	The appellant contends that the Magistrate's determination
was erroneous in point of law upon the following grounds:
<P>

"(a)	That I was in error in law in holding that the appellant should not have
commenced proceedings on behalf of the respondent
when I had found that the
damage to unit 5 was both structural and internal;  and that the damage to unit
5 was not limited to common
property within the meaning of the <b>Strata Titles
Act</b> 1973.
<P>

(b)	That I was in error in law in holding that the appellant should not have
commenced proceedings on behalf of the respondent when
there was no evidence
which could support the conclusion that the walls were structural walls or that
the damage to unit 5 was limited
to structural damage or that the damage to
units was limited to common property within the meaning of the <b>Strata Titles
Act</b> 1973.
<P>

(c)	That I was in error in law in holding that the commencement of the District
Court proceedings by the appellant exposed the respondent
to a risk that his
proceedings would be struck out when there was no such risk or no evidence that
there was such a risk.
<P>

(d)	That I was in error in law in failing to take into account the fact that at
no time did any of the parties seek to strike out
the respondent's claim in the
District Court proceedings or to seek costs against the respondent by reason
that the action had been
commenced against Mr Mann in the District Court.  
<P>

(e)	That I was in error in law in holding that the appellant was responsible
for any of the loss in circumstances where I had already
found it was the
respondent's decision to discontinue the District Court proceedings of his own
volition.
<P>

(f)	That I was in error in law in holding that the appellant was responsible
for any of the loss in circumstances where I failed
to advert to the fact that
the respondent's own counsel advised against the course which the respondent
then took.  
<P>

(g)	That I was in error in law in holding that the appellant was fifty percent
responsible in circumstances where I had already
found that the effective cause
of the loss was the respondent's own actions.  
<P>

(h)	That I was in error in law in holding that the appellant was fifty percent
responsible in circumstances where I failed to advert
to the fact that the
respondent's own counsel advised against the very course which the respondent
then took.
<P>

(i)	That I was in error in law in failing to award the appellant its costs of
the proceedings in the Local Court."
<P>

6   	Mr Sirtes appeared for the appellant in the proceedings
before me.  He indicated that the principal ground of challenge to
the
Magistrate's determination was contention (b), namely, that there was no
evidence which could support the Magistrate's conclusion
that the walls were
structural walls or that the damage to unit 5 was limited to structural damage.

<P>

7   	It will be noted that, among the facts found by the
Magistrate, was that "substantial structural and internal damage was caused
to
unit No. 5" (paragraph 2.2).  It was the appellant's submission that this
factual finding could not sit with the Magistrate's
determination that "it was
the body corporate which has suffered damage and not the respondent" (paragraph
4.1).  This matter is
the subject of contention (a). 
<P>

8   	In the proceedings before me it was contended that the
evidence before the Magistrate led on behalf of the respondent was deficient
in
that it did not identify with precision the damage to unit 5.  In that respect
it was submitted that one could not exclude that
some of the damage the subject
of the respondent's original claim in the District Court proceedings was to
property forming part
of the respondent's lot  as distinct from the common
property.  The appellant sought to call in aid the suggested inconsistency
referred
to in paragraph 7 above.
<P>

9   	The Statement of Claim drafted by the appellant in the
proceedings initiated in the District Court was in evidence before the
Magistrate.  I pause to note that Mr Sirtes drew attention to the circumstance
that the Statement of Claim as amended, being the
pleading which was before
Phelan DCJ as at 11th March 1994 when the order for costs was made, was not
tendered.  In my view nothing
turns on this.  In the Statement of Claim, as
drafted by the appellant, the following particulars of damage are pleaded:
<P>

(a)	Lounge room:  adjoining bedroom:
<P>

	
<P>

(i)	the internal walls show cracking
<P>

	(ii)	there is continuing stress and tension in internal walls due to
undermining of lateral support
<P>

(iii)	the internal walls are unstable and load-bearing capacity reduced.
<P>

(b)	Bathroom:
<P>

	(i)	the walls surrounding the door jamb shows cracking, and deformation 
<P>

	(ii)	the tiling demonstrates measurable separation between walls and floor
<P>

	(iii)	the bathroom floor has subsided, and there are continuing lateral
stresses.
<P>

(c)	Generally:
<P>

	(i)	the load-bearing and lateral supports of home unit lot 5 in strata plan
22669 have been undermined.
<P>

10   	It may be appropriate to note something of the way in
which the proceedings developed before the Magistrate.  On that occasion
the
appellant was represented by Mr Perram.  No issue appears to have been taken as
to whether the damage was to the common property.
 The focus of Mr Perram's
submissions was directed to issues of causation.  The transcript of proceedings
on 18th December 1995 records
Mr Freeman, who appeared for the respondent,
stating:
<P>

"There's been no evidence called to rebut any of the evidence given by my
client regarding the walls and the fact that they represent
common walls.  And
I understand from my friend that he conceded that they were common walls from
the outset."
<P>

Mr Perram did not take issue with that assertion in reply. 
<P>

11   	When one has regard to how the matter was conducted before
the Magistrate any apparent contradiction between the factual finding
that
internal damage, in addition to structural damage, was caused to unit No. 5 and
the finding that it was the body corporate which
had suffered damage and not
the respondent loses the significance for which the appellant now contends.
Internal walls may form part
of the common property or they may form part of a
lot. In <b>Burcchard v Holroyd Municipal Council</b> &amp; Ors. (unreported,
NSWSC, 16th January 1984) Roden J held that the internal walls in that case
were not part of the common property.
Mr Freeman submitted before the
Magistrate that the evidence as to the structure of the walls in the present
case (structural cavity
walls containing air ducts) distinguished it from
<b>Burcchard</b>. There was no submission to the contrary.  The status of
internal walls may depend upon whether they correspond with a heavy "base"
line
drawn on the floor plan, (<b>Strata Title Management Practice In New South
Wales</b>, Bugden, 6th Ed. CCH para 207) or whether they enclose pipes, wires,
cables or ducts not for the exclusive use of one lot;  s.5 of
the <b>Strata
Titles Act </b>1973 (the proceedings took place prior to the renaming of this
Act as the <b>Strata Titles (Freehold Development) Act </b>1973). 
<P>

12   	The Statement of Liquidated Claim by which the respondent
commenced proceedings in the Local Court against the appellant pleaded:
<P>

"On or about 12 June, 1989 illegal and improper building works carried out in a
unit below the plaintiff's caused <i>substantial structural and internal
damage</i> to the plaintiff's unit.  The plaintiff suffered loss and damage."

<P>

 
<P>

13   	The Magistrate's formulation "substantial structural and
internal damage" may have been taken from the pleading. It was at
all times the
respondent's case before the Magistrate that the damage was to common property.
There is nothing in the formulation
"substantial structural and internal
damage" from which I would conclude that the Magistrate found damage occasioned
to the respondent's
unit was to other than the common property. Nothing in the
particulars contained in the Statement of Claim (paragraph 9 above) identifies
damage to property which on its face falls outside common property.  The
reference to "internal walls" is not to be viewed as exclusive
of common
property.
<P>

14   	It was Mr Sirtes' contention that in the absence of the
respondent identifying with precision every item of damage alleged
he should
not have succeeded before the Magistrate on the locus issue;  "If there was one
crack in one wall which was not common
property that was enough locus standi".
 
<P>

15   	I am asked to determine whether there was any evidence to
support the factual finding set out in paragraph 2.2.  To this end
I may have
regard to the depositions;  <b>Glover v McDougall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%202%20NSWLR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 2 NSWLR 359</a> at
361.  
<P>

An error of fact finding will not be elevated to an error of law, if based on
evidence open to the Magistrate;  <b>Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) P/L</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247.</a> 
<P>

  
<P>

16   	The respondent gave evidence before the Magistrate. He was
qualified as a person who had been engaged in the building industry
for a
period of twenty years (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.14 &amp; Ex 7). He described the
general structure of the block of units. The building
comprised three storeys;
two above ground level and one below. The walls were bedded on foundation beds
in the ground and common
floor joists and bearers were let into the walls so
they could support both the flooring on top and the ceiling underneath (t'cpt
29/11/95 p.14). If the walls were not holding up the floor nothing would
support it (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.14). A copy of the floor plan
of unit No 3 (the
unit the subject of the renovations carried out by Mr Mann) was tendered in the
course of the respondent's examination
in chief. The respondent stated that
unit 3 was directly below unit 5 and that unit 1 was proportionally below unit
3 (t'cpt 29/11/95
p.15). Brick walls come from the foundations of the building
up to the roof. Those walls are brick cavity walls with an air duct
in the
centre (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.15). The bathroom walls are cavity walls. They travel
up through unit 3 to unit 5 (t'cpt 29/11/95
p.15).  All the plumbing and
services to the respondent's bathroom are contained in the cavity wall (t'cpt
29/11/95 p.16). 
<P>

17   	The respondent next identified a floor plan of unit 3
which depicted the building works proposed by Mr Mann (Ex 3). The internal
wall
between the family room and the dining room is of double brick cavity
construction (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.16). That wall was depicted
on Ex 3 as a double
line of the same thickness as the double lines showing the external walls. The
wall between the dining and living
rooms is of double brick cavity construction
(t'cpt 29/11/95 p.16). Ex 3 also shows the bathroom walls earlier referred to
by the
respondent as cavity walls (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.16). Ex 3 shows the
alteration to the location of one of the bathroom walls. This was
the wall
which divided the bathroom from the living room (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.16). The
walls between bedroom 1 and the courtyard and
from the kitchen to the courtyard
(as shown on Ex 3) were partly demolished (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.17). The walls to
the respondent's
unit were directly above those walls (t'cpt 29/11/95 p.17).

<P>

18   	Mr Sirtes contended that the respondent had not in terms
identified the damage to his unit. In this respect the submission
was advanced
that the tender of the floor plans of unit 3 showing the original plan and the
alterations to that unit did not assist
in determining whether the damage
occasioned to unit 5 was as to the common property. The evidence was that unit
5 was located directly
above unit 3 and that the walls of unit 5 were directly
above the walls of unit 3.  The damage pleaded was damage to walls, subsidence
of the bathroom floor and undermining of load-bearing and lateral supports. In
my view it was open to the Magistrate to conclude
in the light of the evidence
as to the floor plan of Unit 3 (the walls depicted thereon being identical to
those in Unit 5), the
evidence as to the structure of the block and the
alterations to the walls in Unit 3 that the damage pleaded in the Statement of
Claim in the District Court proceedings was damage occasioned to the common
property. 
<P>

19   	As noted above, the contention that was to the fore in the
submissions advanced before me by Mr Sirtes was contention (b).
 Contention (a)
I have already dealt with in paragraph 12.  I do not find there was an
inconsistency (putting to one side the question
of whether an inconsistency in
factual findings would in any event amount to an error of law;
<b>Soulemezis</b>).  Mr Sirtes advanced no submissions relating to contention
(c) and, indeed, foreshadowed that he may abandon it.  In the ultimate
analysis
he did not formally do so.  Given that I am of the view that there was evidence
to support the Magistrate's finding that
it was the body corporate which had
suffered damage and not the respondent, I consider there was no error in law in
the Magistrate
holding that the commencement of the District Court proceedings
exposed the respondent to a risk that his proceedings would be struck
out.  
<P>

20   	Paragraphs (d) to (f) raise issues of causation. Mr Sirtes
frankly conceded that if I was of the view that the Magistrate
did not err in
relation to contention (b) it would flow that the appellant had difficulties
with the causation challenge. The only
issue of causation upon which Mr Sirtes
advanced submissions was contention (e). On their face neither contentions (d)
nor (f) have
merit and that was recognised in the way the matter was argued.

<P>

21   	Ground (e) relies on the circumstance that it was the
respondent's decision to discontinue the District Court proceedings.
 This it
was submitted was the immediate cause of the order for costs made against him.
The Magistrate found that the proceedings
ought not to have been commenced
against Mr Mann in the first place.  The proceedings  were commenced on the
advice of the appellant.
From these facts he found the respondent had made out
his case in negligence against the appellant and rejected the view that the
discontinuance by the respondent was a novus actus interveniens breaking the
chain of causation such as to relieve the appellant
from liability for the
damage suffered.   The finding of novus actus interveniens is a question of
fact and degree. In my view it
was open to the Magistrate to find as he did.

<P>

22   	Given my view that the Magistrate did not err in law in
determining that the appellant should not have initiated proceedings
on the
respondent's behalf in the District Court, I see little to commend contentions
(g) and (h). In written submissions it is contended
on the appellant's behalf
that the respondent "had the burden of proving that had the pleading not been
filed against what he contended
was the wrong party he would never have
suffered an order for costs" and that the respondent "had to bring evidence
that the costs
order, or any costs order, was an inevitability". I do not
accept these propositions. The Magistrate found that the proceedings ought
not
to have been commenced. Commencing proceedings without standing so to do
exposes a plaintiff to the risk of an order for costs
against him or her. That
risk eventuated in the present case. As Mr Sirtes conceded in the course of
oral argument, once it was accepted
that Mr Mann ought not to have been joined
in these proceedings, it might be thought fortunate from the appellant's point
of view
that the Magistrate apportioned the damages to be paid at 50% of the
costs order.
<P>

23   	I would answer the contentions raised by the stated case
by holding that the Magistrate's determination was not erroneous
in law.
