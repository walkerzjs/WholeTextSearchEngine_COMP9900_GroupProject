<b>50124/1994 - COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA   v  HURST &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	On 18 September 1998 the Court ordered that the plaintiff,
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, for which Mr M. Walton of Senior
Counsel
appeared, should, relevantly for present purposes, have judgment against the
fifth defendant, Cade Hurst Enterprises Pty
Limited, ("Cade Hurst"), for
possession, inter alia, of all the land contained in Certificate of Title
Reference 6/2/757544 being
the land at 79 Creek Street, Jindera in the State of
New South Wales, ("the property").  That order flowed from Cade Hurst's having
mortgaged the property to the plaintiff by a mortgage, which is dated 9 January
1980, and which is registered on the title. The correct
reference to the title
is Certificate of Title Reference 6/2/758544, which was corrected pursuant to
the slip rule and without objection.
<P>

2   	By a Notice of Motion filed on 6 July 1999 the plaintiff
sought leave to issue a Writ of Execution forthwith to obtain possession
of the
property and, subject to a matter to which I shall refer in a moment, it is not
suggested that the plaintiff is not entitled
to that order.
<P>

3   	By a Notice of Motion filed in Court on 16 July 1999, Mrs
Helen Ann Hurst, who was not a party to the original proceedings
and for whom
Mr J.J. Loofs of Counsel appeared, sought orders that she be granted leave to
intervene in these proceedings and be
added as the sixth defendant, that the
plaintiff's Notice of Motion seeking leave to issue the Writ of Execution be
stayed:-
<P>

<b>"pending the outcome of the proceedings commenced by Helen Ann Hurst in the
Family Court of Australia at Melbourne on 11 May 1999
numbered 4881 of
1999",</b>
<P>

and for ancillary relief.  The Notice of Motion was supported by an affidavit
she swore. The plaintiff consented to her being added
as the sixth defendant
and, at that time, it was envisaged that she would file a Cross-Claim. The
plaintiff made it clear that it
reserved its right to object to the form of any
Cross-Claim.
<P>

4   	Mrs Hurst is married to the fourth defendant, Mr Roger Cade
Hurst.  Divorce proceedings between Mr and Mrs Hurst are presently
pending in
which she seeks, inter alia, a settlement of property.  Her claim is that Mr
Hurst transfer all his right, title and interest
in the property to her; that
pursuant to s.85 of the <b>Family Law Act</b> the disposition by Mr Hurst of
the property be set aside; and alternatively, pursuant to s.78 of that Act, it
be declared that either
she or she and Mr Hurst are the owners of the
property.
<P>

5   	In her affidavit of 14 July 1999 Mrs Hurst deposed that she
resides with her son at the property in which she has lived since
it was
purchased in 1980.  She set forth that she is the wife of Mr Hurst and certain
particulars about their relationship and, in
paragraph 3, that she did not seek
legal advice in relation to the present proceedings until about April 1999,
because until then
she considered she was unable to do "anything".  She
continued:-
<P>

<b>"It was only after I sought advice that I became aware of my right to bring
an application with respect to my home."</b>
<P>

6   	She referred to the orders sought in the Family Court and,
in paragraph 9, deposed to her belief that Cade Hurst, which is
apparently now
in receivership, holds the property on a constructive or resulting trust for
her "subject to the amount outstanding
on loan number 22939501".
<P>

7   	She stated that if a Writ of Possession is issued:-
<P>

<b>".. the Family Court application will be nugatory and I will have no
opportunity to prove my interest in the property".</b>
<P>

<b>The Cross-Claim</b>
<P>

8   	By a Cross-Claim, filed in Court on 30 July 1999, Mrs Hurst
pleaded that Cade Hurst is the registered proprietor of the property,
and that
between late 1979 and 8 January 1980 Mr Hurst represented to her that she and
he were purchasing the property as their matrimonial
home for $70,000, and that
in reliance on the representation she agreed to borrow $30,000, by way of a
home loan, to assist with
the purchase.  She alleged that in about January 1980
the plaintiff advanced $30,000 to her and Mr Hurst, and represented to her
that
the advance was a home loan to be used for the purpose of the purchase of the
property "as a home".  Mrs Hurst pleaded that
in reliance on that
representation she borrowed $30,000 and directed its disbursement for use in
the purchase of the property, and
that the property was purchased in the name
of Cade Hurst with the funds she and Mr Hurst had borrowed.
<P>

9   	Mrs Hurst pleaded that she did not authorise Mr Hurst or
Cade Hurst to purchase the property in the latter's name; that she
was not
aware that they had done so; that the plaintiff knew or should have known that
she reposed trust and confidence in Mr Hurst;
and that it believed that she was
purchasing a matrimonial home to be enjoyed by her beneficially.
<P>

10   	She continued that the plaintiff knew that the property
was purchased in the name of Cade Hurst, and was not a matrimonial
home owned
beneficially by her but property acquired by Cade Hurst; that at all material
times it was held upon a resulting or constructive
trust for her, or for her
and "the fifth defendant", which I think should read "the fourth defendant";
and that by reason of the
matters pleaded the plaintiff has known that the
property has been held on constructive or resulting trust for her and/or for
her
and Mr Hurst.
<P>

11   	Mrs Hurst pleaded that a mortgage was granted over the
property to secure the repayment of $30,000 advanced by the plaintiff
to her;
and that unbeknown to her, the plaintiff also procured Mr Hurst and Cade Hurst
to grant a further mortgage to secure advances
and financial accommodation to
Cade Hurst, each of such mortgages being pleaded as in breach of the resulting
or constructive trusts
upon which Cade Hurst held the property.
<P>

12   	In paragraph 21 she pleaded that the plaintiff knew, or
should have known, that the purport and effect of the mortgages were
not known
to her; that the mortgages were over property in which she had a beneficial
interest; that there was no consideration to
her for the granting of the
mortgage (presumably the second mortgage) in respect of the property; that the
mortgages were of no benefit
to her; that the mortgage (presumably the second
mortgage) involved a dealing with her property by Cade Hurst; and that the
mortgages
were in breach of the resulting or constructive trusts upon which
Cade Hurst held the property.
<P>

13   	It was pleaded that by reason of the plaintiff's knowledge
or implied consent to Cade Hurst's breach of trust, the plaintiff
holds its
interest in the property the subject of the first or second mortgages on
constructive trust for Mrs Hurst; or that by procuring
the purchase of the
property and its and the subsequent registration of a transfer of it to Cade
Hurst, the plaintiff acted "unconscionably".
<P>

14   	In the alternative it was pleaded that the plaintiff is
estopped from denying that the property is and has been at all material
times
owned beneficially by Mrs Hurst, or by her and Mr Hurst "subject to the
repayment of the housing loan from asserting any interest
in the property by
way of charge or mortgage".
<P>

15   	In paragraph 26 it was pleaded that there is a matrimonial
cause between Mrs Hurst and Cade Hurst "by reason of which the
Family Court of
Australia has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rights of" Mrs Hurst and
Cade Hurst.
<P>

<b>The Present Situation</b>
<P>

16   	Mr Walton submitted that:-
<P>

(i)	as between the plaintiff and Cade Hurst, the plaintiff has a judgment which
remains enforceable until it is set aside;
<P>

(ii)	there is no application by any party to set that judgment aside;
<P>

(iii)	there is no submission that, subject to the alleged interests of Mrs
Hurst, the plaintiff is not entitled to have leave to
issue a Writ of Execution
for possession of the property; and
<P>

(iv)	by her Cross-Claim Mrs Hurst does not assert any entitlement, as against
the plaintiff, to possession and, perhaps more significantly,
she does not
plead as against the plaintiff that it acquired its interest in the property by
way of fraud.
<P>

17   	On behalf of Mrs Hurst, Mr Loofs submitted that her
Cross-Claim clearly pleaded an entitlement to an interest in the property,
and
that until such time as that entitlement had been litigated the plaintiff
should not be allowed to exercise its rights to take
possession.  He did not
submit that the Cross-Claim asserted other than an equitable interest in the
property or fraud.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

18   	In my opinion Mrs Hurst's Cross-Claim pleads sufficient to
establish on the necessary prima facie basis, and accepting the
truth of the
facts pleaded for present purposes, that she may have an equitable interest in
the property.  If, in due course, she
can establish such an interest and that
it has been adversely affected by the actions of the plaintiff it may be, and I
put the matter
no higher than that, that she is entitled to some relief against
the plaintiff.  However, the position is that the plaintiff is seeking
to
enforce the rights it has under a registered mortgage against the registered
proprietor of the property, Cade Hurst, which gave
the plaintiff the mortgage.
Even allowing, for present purposes, that the plaintiff had knowledge of Mrs
Hurst's interest in the
property, in the absence of any allegation of fraud it
has the benefit of the provisions of s.43 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/rpa178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></b> 1900
and, accordingly, is not affected by any such asserted knowledge.
<P>

19   	In these circumstances it does not seem to me that there
is any basis for not entitling the plaintiff to enforce its legal
rights
against Cade Hurst.  A further relevant matter is that there is no allegation
that any conduct on the part of the plaintiff
estops or otherwise disentitles
it from obtaining possession as against Mrs Hurst.
<P>

20   	No submissions were addressed to me that this matter could
only be determined by the Family Court of Australia or that the
enforcement of
the judgment could only be effected in that Court.  In my opinion, as there is
a judgment of this Court in the plaintiff's
favour against Cade Hurst, which is
the only judgment the plaintiff is seeking, relevantly for present purposes, to
enforce the Family
Court proceedings raise no impediment in relation to that.
It may be, and I put the matter no higher, that the matters raised in
the
Cross-Claim should be determined by the Family Court in assessing, as between
the relevant parties to that Court's determination,
the various rights.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

21   	I order that:-
<P>

(a) 	leave be granted to the plaintiff to issue a Writ with respect to the
property referred to in paragraph 3(b) of the judgment
entered on 12 October
1998, being the whole of the land contained in Certificate of Title Reference
6/2/758544 and known as Creek
Street, Jindera in the State of New South
Wales;
<P>

(b)	the sixth defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the Notice of Motion;
<P>

(c)	the sixth defendant's Cross-Claim stand over for mention to Friday, 20
August 1999.
