<b><u>3276/97 BOHISA PTY. LIMITED v FREEDOM FURNITURE PTY LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Question for decision</b>
<P>

1   	The question for decision is whether or not the plaintiff,
Bohisa Pty. Limited (Bohisa) is entitled to rent of premises 79
Princes Highway
Kogarah for a period from 15 June 1996 to 19 July 1997.  Bohisa says that there
is an agreement between Bohisa and
the defendant, Freedom Furniture Pty.
Limited (Freedom No 2 or Freedom) to grant and take a lease of that property
for a period of
five years from 20 July 1992; that it is entitled to specific
performance of that agreement by the Freedom No 2 as lessee, that Freedom
No 2
vacated the premises on 7 June 1996 and has refused to pay rent after 15 June
1996; and it is entitled to damages accordingly.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	The following facts are not in issue.  Some are admitted on
the pleadings.
<P>

3   	The premises the subject of dispute were leased by Bohisa
to Freedom Furniture Pty. Limited (Freedom No. 1) by lease registered
number
X617546.  That company is not the present defendant. That lease was for a
period of five years from 20 July 1987.  It contained
an option for a further
term of five years to be exercised by notice in writing given not less than
three months nor more than six
months prior to the expiration of the first
term.  Clause 18 of the lease contained the provisions for exercise of the
option and
for determination of the rent for the period of the ensuing
lease.
<P>

4   	Four individuals guaranteed the performance by the lessee
of its obligations under the lease.  The covenants in question are
set out in
Clause 17 of the lease.  Clause 17.7 provided that in case of exercise of
option:
<P>

17.7	If this Lease shall contain an option for a further lease and the Lessee
shall exercise such option the Lessor's obligation
to grant such a lease shall
be subject to the guaranteeing the Lessee's obligations under such lease and
indemnifying the Lessor
in respect thereof in the terms of the guarantees and
indemnities contained in this clause of this Lease.
<P>

5   	In June 1991 the lease was assigned by Freedom No. 1 to
Pademella Pty. Limited.  It seems that on assignment or about that
time the
lessee Freedom No. 1 changed its name to Feldex No. 1 Pty. Limited and the
assignee Pademella changed its name to Freedom
Furniture Pty. Limited (Freedom
No. 2).  Changes such as this can only result in confusion for creditors but
that is not in issue
here.  On 16 May 1992 Freedom No. 2 changed its named to
Freedom Furniture Limited.  Bohisa consented to the assignment by a deed
of
assignment which bears date 16 June 1992.  The evidence is that it was executed
before that date and that consent was given some
months earlier and certainly
before April 1992.  Prior to giving consent to the assignment, Mr. Lyons, on
behalf of Bohisa sought
advice and received confirmation that the original
lessee and the original guarantors were not released from their obligations
under
the lease on assignment.  It was an additional condition of assignment
that the obligation of the assignee would be guaranteed by
its holding company
Jamison Equity Limited, and that took place.  While the document in question is
called deed of assignment of
lease, in fact it was not an assignment of the
lease but a consent to the assignment together with the guarantee required from
Jamison
Equity Limited.  However, the original guarantors were party to it.
One of the recitals in the document refers to a "transfer of
lease of the same
date".  That transfer was never registered.  Thus until it was written off as
expired, it seems pursuant to request
No. 5530574, as having expired by
effluxion of time, the lease on the title was the lease to the company renamed
Feldex No. 1 Pty.
Limited.
<P>

6   	There were discussions in April 1992 between Mr. Lyons and
Messrs. Hammerschlag and Dewdny representing the assignee.  These
were in
connection with the exercise of the option under the lease which because of the
dates of Easter would have needed to be exercised
by 16 April.  It is not
necessary to decide for the purposes of this case whether an equitable assignee
of the lease can exercise
an option under a registered lease, but only to
recognise that the discussions took place with the last date for exercise in
mind.
<P>

7   	On 16 April 1992 there was an exchange of faxes between
Bohisa and Freedom No. 2.  The first was from Bohisa and was returned
with
additional words written by Mr. Hammerschlag. I set out the complete
document:

<i>			Dear Ray			16/4/92</i>
<P>

<i>			This offer is acceptable.</i>
<P>

			(signed)<i> I. Hammerschlag</i>
<P>

8   	It is this document which is said to bring about a binding
agreement for lease giving rise to this action.
<P>

9   	The solicitor for Bohisa was Mr. Caldwell of Messrs.
Michell Sillar McPhee Meyer.  He had acted for that company for many years.
 On
6 May 1992 he sent to Freedom a form of lease for approval enclosed with a
letter the terms of which are of some significance
and which I set out:
<P>

	
<P>

We act for the Lessor and now enclose the following documents for your
approval:
<P>

1.	Lease (in triplicate);
<P>

2.	Authority;
<P>

3.	Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements;
<P>

Kindly note that the enclosed Lease has not yet been approved by our client and
we therefore reserve the right to make any alterations
or additions thereto as
our client may require.
<P>

Subject to our client's approving of the enclosed documents and our client not
requiring any amendments thereto, we look forward
to receiving the duty
executed Lease together with a cheque in payment of our costs and disbursements
as set out in the enclosed
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements.
<P>

Please ensure that the full details of the Lessee and the Guarantor are
inserted in the Lease and that the Lease is signed at the
foot of each page and
alterations thereto are initialled.
<P>

Please note that the enclosed documents have been submitted on the basis that
no contractual obligation shall be deemed to have
arisen between the Lessee and
the Lessor pending our receiving the duty executed Lease in the form approved
by our client.
<P>

We advise that our assessment of the stamp duty payable on the Lease has been
calculated on a "once and for all" basis whereby the
total rent payable under
the Lease is calculated by compounding for each year after the first year the
rent payable in the first
year of the Lease by the percentage increase in the
Consumer Price Index last issued prior to commencement of the Lease.  As this
figure is liable to vary prior to commencement of the Lease, we reserve the
right to require additional moneys for stamp duty.
<P>

In accordance with the recent resolution of the Council of the New South Wales
Law Society in respect of leasing practice and procedure,
we advise that upon
the terms of the Lease being finalised and our receiving your advice that the
Lessee is in a position to execute
the Lease, we will forward a copy of the
Lease to our client for execution.  We will then conduct an exchange of Leases
in accordance
with the requirements of the Law Society.
<P>

	
<P>

Please note that our client requires that the Lease be executed and returned to
us within twenty one (21) days of the date hereof.
<P>

10   	There was some discussion between the parties about the
condition of the premises.  Then on 24 June 1992 Mr. Raward, solicitor
acting
for Freedom Furniture No. 1 wrote to Mr. Caldwell referring to "the option
lease enclosed with your letter of 15 June 1992"
and requiring some amendments.
No letter of 15 June 1992 is in evidence and it seems more likely than not that
he was really referring
to the letter of 6 May 1992.  While the letter refers
to an option lease his evidence was that he did not treat the matter as an
exercise of option and was seeking changes to the document submitted.  It is of
some importance to understand that it is not claimed
in this action that there
was an exercise of the option.  One of the amendments sought was that any
guarantee of Jamison Equity Limited
be released upon Freedom No 2 being listed
on the Australian Stock Exchange.  The draft lease submitted by Mr. Caldwell
had added
the following words to the covenant in clause 4.1 of the original
lease to keep in repair "the lessee acknowledges that the premises
were in good
and substantial repair order and condition at the commencement of the term."
<P>

11   	There was further correspondence between the solicitors in
October 1992.  Among other matters Mr. Raward said Jamison would
not offer a
guarantee.  Mr. Caldwell responded.  He claimed that there was an enforceable
agreement arising from exercise of the
option.  More importantly he said the
requirement for a guarantee by Jamison Equity would not be waived.
<P>

12   	There was then a gap in correspondence.  Freedom No 2
remained in occupation paying monthly rental on the basis of an annual
rent of
$330,000 plus outgoings.  However, it was seeking a reduction in rent and
either claiming that it had no lease and could
leave at any time, or that it
would find a loophole in the lease and leave in any event.  In the
circumstances it does not much matter
as on any basis there was no lease.  By
this times it seems from a letter of 20 May 1993 from Mr. Caldwell to Mr.
Raward, the lessor
was claiming that there was an enforceable agreement for
lease arising out of "the offer and acceptance contained in correspondence
between our clients of 16 April 1992" and gave notice that consideration was
being given to proceedings for specific performance
and that its rights against
the guarantors to the original lease were reserved, this latter claim being
quite contrary to the rights
asserted.  It should be noted those guarantors
included Jamison Equity as a result of the consent being given to the
assignment to
that original lease.  Mr. Raward responded that there was no
binding agreement as it was clear that the parties had intended that
a formal
document be executed before there was anything binding upon them.
<P>

13   	Matters continued for a while in a state of what might be
described as armed neutrality during 1993.  There was a "without
prejudice"
offer to make some adjustments to what were called "the terms of the lease
agreed to be executed" and a statement from
Freedom No. 2 that it was in
occupation on a monthly basis.
<P>

14   	On 8 January 1996 Freedom No 2 wrote to Mr. Lyons of
Bohisa stating that it intended to vacate, that it was bound to give
only one
month's notice but wished to be reasonable, and that it would be vacating the
premises between April and June 1996.  There
were then negotiations between the
parties as to what work would be required by Freedom under the make good
provisions of the original
lease, Freedom apparently accepting that it was
bound by those.  In April and May there was further correspondence between
solicitors
at which stage Messrs. Freehill Hollingdale and Page were acting for
Freedom.  Freedom finally said that it would vacate on 7 June
1996, which it
did.
<P>

15   	Bohisa then attempted to re-let the premises.  At the
commencement it sought a rent of $400,000 per annum net, meaning with
outgoings
in addition.  While that figure was later reduced, the clear evidence is that
the reason the premises were not re-let prior
to 19 July 1997 was that Bohisa
was seeking an excessive rent, even though it should be noted they did
eventually succeed in securing
a tenant for ten years with two five year
options from 1 July 1998 at a commencing rent of $510,000.  It should be noted
however
that a rent-free period of one year was given to the tenant.  It is not
necessary to go into this further other than to state that
as Bohisa was
seeking a rent which was not obtainable it did not do what it could have done
to mitigate its loss, that being its
responsibility, both under the general law
and the specific provisions of the original lease which it claimed were part of
the terms
of the lease agreed to be entered into.
<P>

16   	It is necessary to deal with the pleadings as they present
some real problems.  The plaintiff says that:
<P>

A.	By the exchange of faxes on 16 April 1992 it agreed to lease the premises
for five years from 20 July 1992 at a yearly rent of
$330,000 with a review to
CPI but otherwise upon the terms of the 1987 lease.  I should say it is not
pleaded that the defendant
agreed to accept that lease by that letter, but that
is obviously intended.
<P>

B.	That Freedom continued in occupation but in breach of the agreement refused
to execute a lease.
<P>

C.	That Freedom vacated on 7 June 1996 in breach of the agreement and refused
to pay rent thereafter.
<P>

D.	That by refusing to execute the lease, vacating the premises and refusal to
pay rent, Freedom repudiated the agreement.
<P>

E.	That the plaintiff accepted the repudiation on 10 July 1996 and that it
suffered damage as a consequence of the repudiation.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff then seeks (a) a declaration as to there
being a binding agreement as alleged; (b) a declaration it is entitled
to an
order for specific performance of that agreement; (c) a declaration the
defendant has repudiated the agreement and the plaintiff
has accepted that
repudiation; and (d) damages and interest.
<P>

18   	The defendant (a) denies the agreement; (b) denies any
damages; (c) says there is a failure to mitigate; (d) as alternative
defences
says that (i) the parties as from 6 May 1992 abandoned any agreement; (ii) any
lease which would have arisen was surrendered
by operation of law (iii) any
lease which would have arisen was terminated by agreement.
<P>

19   	I have set the plaintiff's claim out in some detail
because it throws up some real problems.  This is an action in the Equity
Division.  Whatever else it could have been intended to be it could hardly have
been thought to have been an action for damages for
breach of contract properly
brought in the Common Law Division.  That in some ways would seem to be clear
from the claim for a declaration
as to entitlement to an order for specific
performance.  However, while there is a claim for a declaration as to
entitlement to the
order there is no claim for an order for specific
performance.  Rather there is a claim for a declaration of termination upon
acceptance
of repudiation by the defendant which would be quite contradictory
to a declaration of entitlement to an order for specific performance.
<P>

20   	In the light of this rather extraordinary state of affairs
and the contradictory claims it is probably best to try to deal
with those
contradictory claims and I will do so.  There are many points which have been
argued on some of which it would be possible
to write a detailed judgment,
perhaps interesting to lawyers but not to the parties, and therefore I will
endeavour to deal with
the matter in as clear and simple a way as possible.
<P>

21   	It is clear the court could not make a declaration that
the plaintiff is entitled to an order for specific performance if
no order is
sought or could be sought on the pleaded claim.  In those circumstances it is
not necessary to consider further the question
of backdating an order for
specific performance so as to give it some efficacy in this case, in light of
the fact that the term of
the lease, on any basis, has expired: as to this see
the discussion in <b><cite>Chan v Cresdon Pty. Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168
CLR 243.</a>  For the same reason it is not necessary to consider what might flow
from this on the assumption an order would have been made so
as to bring a
claim for damages within in the principle of <b><cite>Walsh v
Lonsdale</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1882%5d%2021%20Ch%20D%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1882] 21 Ch D 9.</a>  It follows from this that the claim of
the plaintiff must be limited to a claim for damages for refusal to enter into
a lease in
terms of the agreement pleaded.  That is of course a common law
claim but nevertheless I will deal with it.  Any damages would not
necessarily
equate with those which would be available on a successful claim for a breach
of the covenant in the lease agreed to
be entered into.  The first answer to a
claim is that the plaintiff has never asked Freedom to enter into such a lease.
Rather the
lease put forward on 6 May 1992 by the plaintiff's solicitors was
not a lease in accordance with the pleaded agreement.  But even
had it been and
had Freedom signed it, that would not in itself have been acceptable to Bohisa
because it required a guarantee of
the lessee's obligations from Jamison Equity
Limited which Freedom was not able to obtain.  The clear evidence of Mr. Lyons,
made
even clearer by the correspondence, was that the guarantee was necessary.
Thus it cannot be said there was any loss which would have
arisen had Freedom
Furniture been asked to sign and refused to sign a lease on the terms set out.
As I have said it was not asked
to do so.  It follows from this that the
plaintiff's claim must fail.
<P>

22   	In fairness to the parties I should deal with some of the
other matters.  The contract was required to be in writing - <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act 1919</a></u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s54a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s54A.</a>  Assuming then that it was a contract to enter into a lease
upon the terms of the existing lease as altered, as set out in the letter,
then
the letter did not make it clear that the guarantee of Jamison Equity Limited
was required.  It was an essential term.  However,
I think that the better view
is that it could be taken to be necessarily implied in view of the negotiations
on the assignment. 
Nevertheless it was essential to the landlord being willing
to grant a lease and was a condition precedent to any lease being entered
into.
It has not been claimed that Freedom contracted to obtain the guarantee.  As
the agreement put forward to enter into the lease
was admittedly dependent upon
the guarantee being available, there could be no breach of the agreement if
that condition was not
fulfilled.  
<P>

23   	Most of the argument in this case was directed towards the
question of whether the parties intended to be bound upon the signing
of the
letter or faxes, or whether their intention was that there be no binding
agreement until formal documentation was drawn up.
 The parties were, I think,
directing their minds towards an option for renewal rather than a new lease.
It would have been possible
to arrange a valid exercise of the option with the
rent agreed in advance and appropriate documentation, but that was not done.
Nevertheless
I consider that the parties intended to enter into binding
relations by the exchange on 16 April 1992, but that their intention was
that
there would be a lease following an exercise of option.  They expected the
agreement to be encapsulated in formal documentation
as at a later date.  While
the case law establishes that in commercial agreements of the magnitude of this
one which relate to land,
the general principle is that the executing of formal
documentation is necessary for a contract to come into existence, it
nevertheless
remains a question of intention:  <b><cite>Blackburn Developments
No. 19 Pty. Limited v Downs Surgical (Australia) Pty. Ltd.</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20BPR%2097%2d689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2
BPR 97-689</a>; <b><cite>Landsmiths Pty. Limited v Hall</cite></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/735.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC
735.</a>  I consider here that it was the intention of the parties to be bound, but
on the basis of a common mistake as to the effect of their
action.  However I
have also concluded that if I am wrong in this and there was a binding
agreement the parties acted so as to abandon
or bring that agreement to an end,
and embarked upon negotiations for a new agreement.  So far as the plaintiff is
concerned that
is made perfectly clear by the letter from its solicitor dated 6
May 1992 and the proposed alterations to the lease clearly brought
about as a
result of negotiations about the state of the building which took place between
the parties.  So far as the tenant is
concerned, it is made clear by the
negotiations upon the terms of the lease and the inability to offer the
guarantee.  The plaintiff's
solicitor never sought to retract the statements in
his letter of 6 May 1992.  What he did on 23 October 1992 was adopt a new
position
based upon exercise of the option which position was not maintainable.
Neither party proceeded on the basis of the contract originally
made, both
parties proceeded on a basis contrary to it.  Thus it is proper to conclude
that they both abandoned it, both acting on
that basis in their actions towards
the other; <b><cite>Summers v The Commonwealth</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1918] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2025%20CLR%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 25 CLR 144</a> at

<P>

24   	For these various reasons I find that the plaintiff's
claim fails and that the amended statement of claim should be dismissed
with
costs.
