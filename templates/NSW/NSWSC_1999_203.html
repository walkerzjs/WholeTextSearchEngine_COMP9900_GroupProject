<b>4957 OF 1997 KAREN ANNE WILLIAMS v JAMES ALBERT MASTERTON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER: </b> This is an application under the <b>Defacto Relationships
Act</b> for adjustment of property interests of the parties.  There is no
dispute about the existence of the defacto relationship and its
duration.  The
parties commenced their relationship on 12 December 1989 and it continued until
11 October 1997.  The parties have
one child, Jamie who was born on 14 December
1990.  In addition the plaintiff had two children by her former husband.  These
were
Gavin who was born on 11 November 1976 and Joseph who was born 28 October
1977.  At the commencement of cohabitation Gavin was 13
years of age and Joseph
12 years of age.  They both lived with the parties until they left home at
various times and were members
of the household consisting of the parties and
later the parties and their child, Jamie.  
<P>

2		The plaintiff and the defendant first met in August 1988 and they socialised
for some time until they commenced cohabitation
in December 1989.  At that
stage the plaintiff was 35 years and the defendant 26 years.  They lived
initially in the plaintiff's
parent's home in Tuncurry and paid rent to the
plaintiff's parents.  At the time of commencement of cohabitation the defendant
was
involved in a business known as Great Lakes Appliance Service.  The
plaintiff was not working and was in receipt of social security
with which she
supported her children.  
<P>

3		At the time of the commencement of cohabitation the plaintiff's financial
situation was fairly straightforward.  She had the
following assets:-
<P>

	A Holden motor car                        600.00
<P>

	Household furniture &amp; appliances        2,000.00
<P>

	Bank account                            <u>  500.00</u>
<P>

	Total                                  <u>$3,500.00</u>
<P>

4		The defendant's situation at the commencement of cohabitation also was
fairly straight forward although there was some debate
before me about the
extent of his interest in the business.  His business was one which prior to
the beginning of December 1989 was
operated by him and his brother-in-law.  It
dealt with the retail sale of household appliances and also the repair of
appliances.
 In November 1989 the defendant and his brother-in-law sold the
retail side of the business to Godwins Betta Electrical.  Emmanuel
Vanary, the
defendant's brother-in-law decided at that stage, because he did not have
skills in repairing, that he would continue
to work with Godwins Betta
Electrical.  Accordingly the parties came to an agreement for the purchase of
his half interest in the
remainder of the business.
<P>

5	Both the defendant and Mr Vanary saw their accountant and they adopted a
figure of $36,000 as the value of the goodwill of the
repair side of the
business.  On 12 December 1989 the sum of $60,000 was deposited to the credit
of the account for the business
which the two had maintained.  That was the
purchase price which they received for the sale of the retail side to Godwins.
In early
December Mr Vanary commenced working with Godwins and over Christmas
Mr Masterton and the plaintiff set up fresh premises for the
repair business
which he was to continue.  
<P>

6	The defendant and Mr Vanary kept the account open into which the $60,000 had
been deposited so that the final payment of creditors
and receipts relating to
the repair side of the business could be adjusted.  Eventually in May cheques
were drawn in favour of Mr
Masterton for $25,523.37 and in favour of Mr Vanary
for $51,640.51.  The difference between these two figures, namely, $26,117.14
was accounted for by the amount which the two had agreed was the payment for a
half share of the goodwill of the repair business,
namely, $18,000 and the
balance of $8,117.14 represented an allowance for one half of the value of the
stock which Mr Masterton had
taken over plus minor matters of interest.
<P>

7		There was evidence by both the defendant and Mr Vanary as to these
arrangements and I have no reason to doubt the evidence. 
Given the agreed
price for the value of the business it would seem that the total value of the
business, excluding stock, would be
$36,000.
<P>

8		Although the arrangements in respect of the sale of the business occupied
from December to the following May before the funds
were finally paid out they
do give a useful indication of what were the assets of the defendant as at
commencement of cohabitation
on 12 December 1997.  Accordingly, it is useful to
use these figures in order to determine the position of the defendant as at
commencement
of cohabitation.  On this basis the defendant's position at the
commencement of the relationship was as follows:-
<P>

	Goodwill of the business known as
<P>

	Great Lakes Appliance Service             36,000
<P>

	Stock Great Lakes Appliance Service
<P>

approx                                    16,000
<P>

<b>	</b>Cash resulting from the sale of the 
<P>

	retail side of the business               25,523.37
<P>

	Toyota Landcruiser                         4,000
<P>

	Half Cabin boat &amp; 15 HP Johnson Motor      4,000
<P>

	Household furniture                        4,000
<P>

	Camping equipment                          3,000
<P>

	Tools                                      2,000
<P>

	Personal effects &amp; Jewellery
<P>

9		So far as liabilities are concerned the defendant had a loan from his mother
of some $12,000 which was due to him and which had
originally provided funds
for him to go into the business.  That amount is still outstanding to his
mother and perhaps for the purposes
of adjustment  of the parties' property can
be put to one side.  The camping equipment and tools were ultimately received
by the
defendant after the termination of cohabitation and they can also be put
to one side.
<P>

10		I will now deal with some of the history which occurred so far as assets
are concerned following commencement of cohabitation.
<P>

11		It is apparent from the details that I have given of the assets of the
parties at the commencement of the relationship that
the defendant had the
majority of the assets and he also had a business which ultimately turned out
to be quite successful.  Accordingly,
the purchase of properties which are
referred to later were made in his name.  
<P>

12		In December 1990 the defendant purchased a property 57 Surfview Avenue,
Forster in his name for $107,000.  The purchase price
was provided as to
$30,000 from the defendant's savings and as to $77,000 by way of a mortgage
from the National Australia Bank.
 The defendant paid the legal costs and stamp
duty of $3,673 and thereafter mortgage payments were made at $250 per week.

<P>

13		In 1992 the defendant opened an additional business in Taree known as Taree
Appliance Service which was initially operated by
a manager, Phillip Barry
Hodges, with the plaintiff working there one day a week.  
<P>

14	In October 1992 the National Australia Bank loan was increased $33,000 and
this money plus an additional $1,000 from the defendant
was used for extensions
and renovations on the property Surfview Avenue.  The mortgage repayments
increased at that stage.  In 1995
a caravan was purchased in the defendant's
name at a cost of $6,200 funded by a loan from the National Australia Bank of
$6,500.
 Also in this year a boat was purchased with Mr Hodges to which the
defendant contributed $500.  
<P>

15		On 18 August 1995 vacant land at Russell Island was purchased in the name
of the defendant for $16,000 which was funded as to
$700 by the defendant and
the balance by vendor finance.  The defendant paid the stamp duty and legal
cost of $1,241.20.  In January
1996 Joseph, the plaintiff's son, started to
work in the defendant's business and in that year the Taree business was sold
for $20,000.
 That sum was used to reduce the mortgage on the Surfview Avenue
property.  Mr Hodges, the Manager, started working at Foster in
that business.
On 1 May 1996 the defendant purchased a property at 26 Nanimar Street, Eugowra
for $36,000 which was fully funded
by a mortgage from the National Australia
Bank for $37,000.  The defendant paid the legal costs and stamp duty of $1,372.
The property
had been purchased from the plaintiff's parents and I will return
to the arrangements for the determination of the purchase money
later when
considering contributions.  The property was then let out and was negatively
geared.  
<P>

16		On 30 July 1996 the defendant leased a Nissan Pathfinder which cost
approximately $48,000.  
<P>

17		On 25 November 1996 a property at 1 Colvin Avenue, Tuncurry was purchased
jointly by the defendant and Mr Hodges for $113,000.
 This again was financed
totally by the National Australia Bank who advanced $117,000.  The defendant
paid the legal costs and stamp
duty.  The property was let to Mr Hodges for
rent of $150 a week which was used to repay the mortgage.  To the extent that
the rent
was not sufficient Mr Hodges and the defendant contributed the
balance.
<P>

18		Early in 1997 Gavin left the Surfview Avenue property.  
<P>

19		At separation the defendant moved from the home at Surfview Avenue to
rented accommodation at 26 Pacific Parade, Tuncurry. 
The parties' child, Jamie
and the plaintiff's son, Joseph, remained at Surfview Avenue.  Subsequently
Joseph left the home and he
is presently apprenticed to the defendant as a
refrigeration mechanic.  
<P>

20		The plaintiff not long after the commencement of the relationship commenced
work in the business.  The extent of her involvement
varied and the details of
what work she did I will come back to later but it meant of course that she
ceased receiving social security.
 Accordingly the various assets that were
purchased came as a result of the income stream coming to the defendant through
the business.
 The plaintiff was paid a wage from the business from October
1990 until November 1996 of $400 per week from November 1996 until
November
1997 of $500 per week.  These wages were used by her to make payments for
household expenses of the family.
<P>

21		It is useful to look at the parties' assets as at separation and at the
present time before considering the extent of contributions
both financial and
non-financial and then the necessary adjustment.
<P>

22		The plaintiff's position at separation had not changed substantially.  She
had household goods and furniture estimated at $4,835,
jewellery and personal
effects and also a financial resource, namely, a superannuation fund which had
a payout value of $3,235.92.
 
<P>

23		At the date of separation the defendant still held the business.  The
parties are agreed that as at the date of the hearing
the value of the business
which presumably incudes stock is $113,000.  The business has a debt which as
at the date of separation
was $64,680.63.  As at the present time that debt has
been reduced to $56,362.48.  The business also has a trading account but as
that fluctuates from substantial credit to debit from time to time depending
upon trade, the amount for these purposes should be
taken as zero.  There was
also a vehicle loan of some $28,332 at separation.  That relates to vehicles
which are used in the business
and is being substantially repaid out of
profits.  It was suggested that as the valuation was on a capitalisation basis
based on
profits any repayments of that loan are taken into account and,
accordingly, it should not be considered.  This is appropriate notwithstanding
that the vehicles are not leased.
<P>

24		The next property held at separation was 57 Surfview Avenue, Foster.  The
parties are agreed that it has a value of $132,500
at the present time.  That
property does not seem to be subject to a loan as at separation or at present.

<P>

25		The next property is the vacant land at Russell Island which the parties
are agreed now has a value of $16,000.  The amount
owing at separation was
$2,694 and none is now owing.
<P>

26		The next property is 26 Nanimar Street, Eugowra which has an agreed present
value of $43,000.  The liabilities at separation
were $34,619.93 and as at
August last year $32,899.85.  The next property is the defendant's one half
interest in 1 Colvin Avenue,
Tuncurry which has an agreed value of $62,500.  At
separation the loan was $56,749.54 and at 23 November 1998 was $53,396.95.
<P>

27		The caravan has a present value of $6,000 and was subject to finance of
$2,590.25 at separation and none at the present time.
 The boat has an agreed
value of $500 is not subject to a liability.  
<P>

28		The Nissan Pathfinder had a value at separation of about $37,000 and
$33,000 at the present time and is subject to a lease and,
accordingly, given
that it will probably be retained and ultimately the lease paid out it is best
to put it to one side bearing in
mind that the amount due under the lease for
payout at one stage probably exceeds the value until one comes to the end of
the lease.
<P>

29		The reason for noting the differences and the liabilities at separation and
at the present time is, of course, that the repayment
of these liabilities have
been by the defendant.  The other post separation matter to which consideration
has to be given is the
fact that the plaintiff has been residing in the
property since separation.  There is evidence which I am prepared to accept
that
the rental value of that is $190 per week and the total of one half of the
rent since separation is $6,555.  The defendant has paid
all the rates and
taxes on the property since separation.  
<P>

30		There are four items of personalty which are in dispute between the
parties.  One is a video camera which each of them wanted
in respect of which
there is no evidence of value.  There are steel rims for tyres worth about $100
which the defendant wishes to
retain.  There is a spa bath worth $1,500 which
the defendant wishes to retain and there is a tub of bromide, value unknown,
which
the defendant wishes.  It is apparently used to clean the pool.
<P>

31		The defendant had a superannuation policy with the AMP having a surrender
value at separation of $6,119.57.  Both parties' policies
were as a result of
compulsory employer contributions.  Later I will deal with the plaintiff's work
history and it will be seen that
she played a major part in the homemaker and
parenting roles.  Given her reduced work hours later in the relationship she
has in
part enabled the defendant to earn his income.  The difference between
the parties' superannuation entitlements is small but I will
take account of
this contribution by the plaintiff in the final adjustment process.
<P>

32	The assets of the relationship are substantially in the name of the
defendant and have been purchased out of or improved using
the cash flow of the
defendant's business.  In these circumstances a global approach rather than an
asset by asset approach is appropriate.
<P>

33	At the commencement of the relationship the parties assets were:-
<P>

	Plaintiff                $3,500
<P>

	Defendant               $89,523
<P>

	(Including tools and camping equipment)
<P>

34	The parties have helpfully agreed many values of present assets.  There is
also agreement on the outstanding loans at separation
and at the present time.
Such equity is, however, in both cases, based upon the present value of the
asset.
<P>

<P>

<b>Total                    <u>$212,164         $230,840</u></b>
<P>

35	The increase in the defendant's assets is thus $122,641 at separation and
$141,317 at trial.
<P>

36	The plaintiff's assets have increased from $3,500 to $4,835 a sum of
$1,335.
<P>

37	Earlier in paragraph 19 I have referred to the fact that the plaintiff was
paid a wage from the business from October 1990 until
November 1996 of $400 per
week and from November 1996 until November 1997 of $500 per week.  These wages
were used by her to make
payments for household expenses of the family.  This
is a total drawing of $152,400.  Over the same period the defendant's gross
personal taxable earnings from the business were $301,916.  There is no doubt
that both parties used these funds for the purposes
of their joint
relationship.  No doubt the payment of wages to Karen was useful from a
taxation point of view for the business as
it provided an appropriate
deduction.  However, even leaving this aside it is probably useful to look at
the plaintiff's contribution
to the business in terms of the nature and
quantity of work which she was engaged in the business.  Clearly, of course,
the defendant
himself was working full time in the business.  The plaintiff has
set out her work in some detail in her affidavit and it is clear
that the
extent of her involvement varied depending upon the progress of the business
and also the birth and age of the child of
the parties, Jamie.  
<P>

38	The business moved in December 1989 and the plaintiff was involved in the
move and setting up the new arrangements.  By April
1990 she says she was
working full time and she typically worked from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. the
business being open five and half days
a week.  Her work involved telephone,
reception, arranging for the booking of repair and service jobs, liaising with
customers, selling
spare parts and second hand appliances.  There was also a
variety of book-keeping functions including typing, some ordering and pricing
of stock and various checking of matters connected with stock, warranty claims
and other accounting matters.  By August 1990 a full
time mechanic was engaged
as the plaintiff was pregnant and was finding it difficult to keep working on a
full time basis.  She started
to take time off and ceased work in November
1990.  In February 1991 she started coming to the business working one or two
days a
week.  Her work started to change to more book work and computer work.
She would tend to spend several days per week doing two hours
work per day.  By
1993 she was working two days per week at the Foster outlet and one day per
week at the Taree outlet.  Taree was
sold in 1995 and the plaintiff concedes
that around this time she obviously did not attend Taree and was spending less
time at the
business and more time at home.  By the time the parties separated
the business had expanded to the extent that there were some six
employees and
a number of service vans which it used and they even had to sub-contract out
work.  This indicates the extent to which
the business had grown.  With the
growth of the business the plaintiff's involvement as she freely conceded in
her affidavit did
diminish.  
<P>

39	For the defendant's part, as I have mentioned, he was working full time in
the business.  It was he who had commenced it and
continued its direction. He
made the major decisions in relation to the ordering of stock and the
management of the business since
he had the knowledge necessary for the
operation of the business in a practical sense.  
<P>

40	So far as homemaker contributions are concerned, it seems that the plaintiff
was primarily responsible for cooking, washing,
ironing, sewing, shopping and
cleaning.  At times the defendant, who regarded himself as house proud, was not
satisfied and would
do some work including vacuuming and occasionally the
defendant would prepare one or two meals a week quite often when the plaintiff
was out on one of her activities such as playing tennis.  
<P>

41	Of greater significance in this case is, of course, the parenting
contributions.  
<P>

42	I have earlier referred to the time that Karen spent in the business.
Although she had some personal activities substantially
the remainder of her
time when not working was involved in undertaking parenting responsibilities
for the children.  At the time
of commencement of cohabitation Gavin was aged
13 years and Joseph was 12 years old.  At that stage the defendant had known
the plaintiff
and the children for over twelve months.  The defendant took a
great interest in the plaintiff's children probably because he had
been
deprived of a father at an early stage in his life.  He had missed the
activities and the enjoyment of a relationship between
a father and a son.  The
defendant in his affidavit set out a substantial number of examples which
showed the assistance which he
gave the children.  Clearly these bespeak an
interest in the boys' welfare and a willingness to be involved in their
activities.
 The plaintiff does not deny this.  However, the fact of the matter
is that the defendant was also working very hard in his business.
 He had to do
service calls and, accordingly, a substantial part of the organisation of the
children's life fell upon the plaintiff.
 She was also, of course, the primary
care giver for the parties' child, Jamie, as he grew up and in his infancy.  By
the end of
the relationship the plaintiff's children were becoming independent
and I have referred to when they moved out from home.  One must
conclude that a
substantial part of the parenting contributions were provided by the plaintiff.
However, this does not diminish the
quality of the contribution that the
defendant made to the children's upbringing.
<P>

43	One thus has a situation where over the period of the relationship there has
been an increase in the parties' assets of something
in the order of $125,000.
One has to balance the homemaking and parenting contributions which have to be
recognised in a substantial
way.  In addition one has to take account of the
actual work that the plaintiff did in the defendant's business.  To this extent
there was a contribution to the joint enterprise which was in the defendant's
name.
<P>

44	There was, as I have mentioned earlier, a claim for an adjustment in respect
of the plaintiff's occupation of the property at
Foster since separation.  The
defendant is paying maintenance to the Child Support Agency and the
accommodation which has been made
available over this period has also been for
the benefit of the parties' child.  In these circumstances I do not see that it
is appropriate
to make a full deduction for the rental value.  Probably what
would have been more appropriate would be direct costs involved but
there is no
evidence of the amount of these costs.  I have earlier referred to the rental
value of the unit and taking these factors
into account I propose to make an
allowance in the final figure in the defendant's favour for $5,000 in respect
of this benefit.
 
<P>

45	The plaintiff gave evidence that in respect of the purchase from her parents
of the property at Eugowra the defendant was given
a discount of $5,000 to
$36,000 to take account of a family arrangement whereby each of the plaintiff
and her siblings were to receive
$5,000 from their parents.  The defendant said
that he negotiated the price with the plaintiff's father and that no such
arrangement
was mentioned.  Such an arrangement may have been considered a
private matter so I would not make an inference adverse to the plaintiff
about
the failure to call her father.  I am prepared to accept that this reduction
was a contribution on the part of the plaintiff

<P>

46	The plaintiff, in her application, seeks a transfer to her absolutely of the
house at 57 Surfview Avenue, Forster.  The defendant,
for his part, originally
contended that an appropriate adjustment would be for him to retain the assets
and to pay the plaintiff
$50,000.  In submissions at the hearing this figure
was modified to $20,000.  
<P>

47	I have earlier indicated that I am putting to one side certain matters,
namely, the tools and camping equipment which the defendant
brought into the
relationship and the loan which he had at the commencement of the relationship
which he still owes to his mother.
 There is a minor adjustment to be made in
regard to superannuation which I have earlier referred to and after noting
these matters
it seems to me that the appropriate order to properly reflect the
contributions, both financial and non-financial would require a
payment by the
defendant to the plaintiff of $67,500.  This pre-supposes that the defendant
will retain the property in which the
plaintiff and the child of the parties
are presently residing and also the Nissan Pathfinder which is leased.  The
plaintiff is to
retain her assets being household goods, furniture and personal
effects.
<P>

48	In paragraph 29 I referred to the items of personalty in respect of which
there is a dispute.  The defendant is to have the steel
rim tyres for an
additional $100 and if the defendant retains the house he should retain the spa
bath and the tub of bromide for
an additional $1,500.  The plaintiff is to have
the video camera.  
<P>

49	There is no suggestion that the plaintiff who is now in receipt of Social
Security could finance any purchase of the property.
 Accordingly, it is likely
that the defendant will retain the property and can raise the appropriate
finance to pay out the plaintiff.
 In the event that this does not occur the
property can be sold.  In any event it will be necessary for the plaintiff and
the child
of the parties to move out of the property.  It may be that the
parties can spend some little time fruitfully arranging for these
matters to
take place.  Accordingly, I will not make orders at this stage but will direct
the parties to bring in short minutes to
reflect these reasons which I now
publish.
<P>
