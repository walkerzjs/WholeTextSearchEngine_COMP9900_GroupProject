<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:  </b>This is the hearing of these proceedings
which concerns a claim as to the making of what are said to be mutual wills by
Derek James
McDonnell and Gwendoline McDonnell.  The matter originally came
before me for the purposes of hearing the defendant's Notice of Motion
filed on
8 June 1999 seeking dismissal of a Statement of Claim both under Part 15 Rule
26 and Part 13 Rule 5.  With the concurrence
of the parties that motion was
stood over to the final hearing of the suit which was brought on expeditiously.
A judge of the court
has referred the whole of the proceedings to a Master for
his determination.  
<P>

2   	Derek James McDonnell and Gwendoline McDonnell married on
13 May 1967.  Each had been married before and each had two children
from an
earlier marriage at the time of their marriage to each other.  They each made
wills on 12 November 1986.  Their wills were
not expressed to be mutual wills.
They appointed the Public Trustee as Executor.  The depositive part of the will
of Derek James
McDonnell is in clause 5 and is the following terms:-
<P>

"I give and devise and bequeath the whole of my estate both real and personal
to my trustee upon trust to pay thereout all my just
debts funeral and
testamentary expenses probate estate death or other duties and thereafter for
my wife Gwendoline McDonnell absolutely
if she be living at the expiration of a
period of thirty (30) days from the date of my death or should my said wife
predecease me
or survive me and die before the expiration of a such period of
thirty (30) days then to divide the residue thereof into two (2)
equal parts
and to hold such parts upon the following terms and conditions namely:-
<P>

(A) As to one (1) of such parts for such of them my children James Robert
McDonnell and Lorraine Noelene Baird who shall be living
at my death and if
both in equal parts absolutely provided however should my said children or
either of them predecease me leaving
a child or children living at my death who
shall attain or have attained the age of eighteen (18) years such child or
children shall
take and if more than one in equal shares absolutely the share
or interest his her or their parent would have taken under this clause
of this
my will had such parent been living at my death.
<P>

(B) As to the remaining one (1) of such parts for such of them my said wife's
children Dolores Smee and Donald William Straney 
who shall be living at my
death and if both in equal shares absolutely provided however should my said
wife's children or either
of them predecease me leaving a child or children
living at my death who shall attain or have attained the age of eighteen (18)
years
such child or children shall take and if more than one in equal shares
absolutely the share or interest his her or their parent would
have taken under
this clause of this my will had such parent been living at my death.
<P>

Provided however that should any of the above mentioned parts fail to vest then
the total number of parts into which residue shall
be divided shall be reduced
by the number of parts failing to vest and the parts failing to vest shall be
construed as nil parts."
<P>

3   	Gwendoline McDonnell's will was a mirror image of this
will.  Derek McDonnell died on 27 April 1992 and the whole of his estate
under
his will passed to Gwendoline.  On 12 March 1993 Gwendoline made a new will
under which she left the whole of her estate to
her two children to the
exclusion of Derek's children.  Gwendoline died on 23 April 1996 and probate
was granted in respect of her
1993 will.   
<P>

4   	The house held by Derek and Gwendoline was held by them as
joint tenants and passed by survivorship to Gwendoline and now hence
to her
children.  The estate of Donald comprised a small amount of cash in the order
of $20,000.  
<P>

5   	In an Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiffs have
pleaded the terms of the agreement for mutual wills as relevantly being
the
following:-
<P>

'(i) that each testator would gift his or her estate absolutely to the other
testator and that in the default of the other testator
surviving the original
testator would gift his or her estate equally to his or her own children of the
one part and to the children
of the other testator of the other part in equal
shares.
<P>

(ii) that each testator promised that he or she would not revoke his or her
mutual will without giving reasonable notice to the
other.
<P>

(iii) that in the event that the first of the two testators to die died in
reliance on his or her mutual will that the survivor
of them would not revoke
his or her mutual will prior to his or her death."
<P>

6   	This case is notable for the fact that there is no direct
evidence of the alleged agreement to make mutual wills in the terms
set out
above.  The court has been asked to infer that there was such agreement from
the following conduct which is particularised
in paragraph 2B of the Amended
Statement of Claim.  That paragraph particularises the following circumstances
as giving rise to the
agreement.
<P>

"(i)  The implication arises from the terms of each of the mutual wills and in
particular the division into two equal parts of the
residuary gift of the
property of each testator and the gifting of those equal parts to the children
of the first marriage of each
testator.
<P>

(ii)  The implication arises from the fact of the making of mutual wills in
identical terms as regards gifting of property equally
to the children of each
testator and the children of each testator's spouse in the circumstances of the
marriage between each of
the testators being the second marriage of each
testator .
<P>

(iii)  The implication arises from the delay on the part of the deceased as the
survivor of the two parties to the mutual wills
agreement in revoking her
mutual will for a period of more than six years between 12 March 1986 and 27
April 1992 (when Mr McDonnell
died) but instead revoking her mutual will some
10 months after Mr McDonnell's death in circumstances where there is no
explanation
for that delay, other than that the deceased was aware that Mr
McDonnell died in reliance on the terms of the mutual wills agreement
and the
mutual wills made pursuant to it.
<P>

(iv)  The implication arises from the state of mind of Mr McDonnell as to his
understanding of the existence of the mutual wills
agreement as is apparent
from the terms of the conversations attributed to him in paragraph 4 of the
affidavit of James Robert McDonnell
sworn 25 June 1998 and in paragraphs 3 and
4 of the affidavit of Lillian Jean McDonnelll sworn 24 June 1998."
<P>

7   	In order to see whether the court can come to the
conclusion which is suggested by the plaintiffs it is necessary to look at
the
evidence which was adduced on the point.  As I have already mentioned above
both of the deceased had previously married and had
children by their earlier
marriage.  It was on 12 March 1986 after they had been married for some 19
years that they made their wills.
 The wills themselves did not contain any
recital of an agreement for mutual wills nor were they even expressed to be
mutual wills.
 There was also tendered in evidence the will instruction sheet
from the Public Trustee who was engaged to draw the wills.  That
also makes no
reference to the wills being mutual but merely reflects what was produced by
way of wills and signed by both deceased.
 Derek McDonnell's former wife,
Lillian Jean McDonnell gave evidence.  She and Derek were divorced in May 1963
and notwithstanding
this she and Derek maintained a cordial relationship given
their children's interests.  She recounted two occasions when Derek spoke
to
her about the wills.  In 1987 during a conversation at South Sydney Junior
Leagues Club Derek discussed the arrangement he had
made with his then wife,
Gwendoline.  He said:-
<P>

"Gwen and I have made our Wills and they provide for our assets to be left to
our two children and to Gwen's two children so they
will all be provided
for."
<P>

8   	This conversation was about a year or so after the wills
had been made.  At a later time, which she estimated at about five
weeks prior
to Derek's death Lillian McDonnell said that Derek rang her and said:-
<P>

"I am not well and I really only have a short time left.  The children need not
worry about the property.  What I told you before
about Gwen's and my Wills has
not changed.  Each of the children will be looked after."
<P>

9   	The only other evidence which was available to the court
was that given by the son of Derek, namely, James Robert McDonnell.
 Several
months before his father's death he came across his father who mentioned to him
that he had cancer and that he wanted to
talk to him.  They met at the Lakes
Hotel the following Saturday where the deceased, Derek, said to his son:-
<P>

"Gwen and I have made our wills.  They provide that my half of the unit will go
to you and your sister and the other half to Gwen's
children."
<P>

10   	As I have mentioned Derek died on 27 April 1992 and it was
on 12 March the following year that Gwendoline made her new will.
 
<P>

11   	In <b>Birmingham v Renfrew </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2057%20CLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 57 CLR 666</a> the High
Court set out a number of principles which apply in respect of mutual wills.
At page 674 His Honour Chief Justice Latham
had the following to say:-
<P>

"There was evidence which, if believed, justified the learned judge in finding
that the existence of the agreement in the terms
already stated was
established. Those who undertake to establish such an agreement assume a heavy
burden of proof. It is easy to
allege such an agreement after the parties to it
have both died, and any court should be very careful in accepting the evidence
of
interested parties upon such a question. Perhaps most husbands and wives
make wills "by agreement," but they do not bind themselves
not to revoke
their wills. They do not intend to undertake or impose any kind of binding
obligation. The mere fact that two persons
make what may be called
corresponding wills in the sense that the existence of each will is naturally
explained by the existence
of the other will is not sufficient to establish a
binding agreement not to revoke wills so made (<b>In re Oldham</b> 60  (1925)
Ch. 75; <b>Gray v. Perpetual Trustee Co.</b> 61  (1928) A.C. 391; and see
<b>Lord Walpole v. Lord Orford</b> 62  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1797/489.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1797] EngR 489</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281797%29%203%20Ves%20402" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1797) 3 Ves. 402</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=30%20ER%201076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">30 E.R. 1076</a>, where
attention is directed to many considerations which may go to show that in a
particular case no binding agreement was intended)."

<P>

12   	At page 681 His Honour Dixon J agreed that the agreement
can only be established by clear and satisfactory evidence.  He went
on to
expand on the result of the agreement found by the trial judge in these
terms:-
<P>

"Gavan Duffy J. found that an agreement had been made, and I do not think that
his finding can be set aside. He found, too, that
the arrangement was not of a
character leaving legal relations unaffected. So far as this is a question of
fact, I think he was fully
justified in taking the view that the wife meant to
obtain from her husband a promise and meant that it should be communicated to
the intended beneficiaries in order the better to ensure its fulfilment. I
think the legal result was a contract between husband
and wife. The contract
bound him, I think, during her lifetime not to revoke his will without notice
to her. If she died without
altering her will, then he was bound after her
death not to revoke his will at all. She on her part afforded the consideration
for
his promise by making her will. His obligation not to revoke his will
during her life without notice to her is to be implied. For
I think the express
promise should be understood as meaning that if she died leaving her will
unrevoked then he would not revoke
his. But the agreement really assumes that
neither party will alter his or her will without the knowledge of the other. It
has long
been established that a contract between persons to make corresponding
wills gives rise to equitable obligations when one acts on
the faith of such an
agreement and dies leaving his will unrevoked so that the other takes property
under its dispositions. It operates
to impose upon the survivor an obligation
regarded as specifically enforceable. It is true that he cannot be compelled to
make and
leave unrevoked a testamentary document and if he dies leaving a last
will containing provisions inconsistent with his agreement
it is nevertheless
valid as a testamentary act. But the doctrines of equity attach the obligation
to the property. The effect is,
I think, that the survivor becomes a
constructive trustee and the terms of the trust are those of the will which he
undertook would
be his last will."
<P>

13   	These passages refer to what has been described in later
cases as the key element in the concept of mutual wills, namely,
the agreement
not to revoke.  See <b>Re Newey (decd) </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%202%20NZLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 2 NZLR 590</a> at 593, <b>Re
Goodchild </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/1611.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] EWCA Civ 1611</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%201%20WLR%201216" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 1 WLR 1216</a> at 1225 and <b>Hubbard v Mason </b>Santow J
unreported 9 December 1997.  They illustrate the requirement that the parties
must have intended to enter into legally binding
relations.  They also refer to
the burden of proof which in New South Wales is the ordinary civil standard
under s 140 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>.  Having regard to the subject matter
this would require clear and satisfactory evidence.  See <b>Hubbard v Mason
</b>at p 17.
<P>

14   	It is clear that the agreement not to revoke may be
implied from all the circumstances.  See <b>Hudson v Gray </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1927/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1927] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281927%29%2039%20CLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1927) 39 CLR 473</a>

16 May 1995 unreported.  
<P>

15   	The judgment of the court in <b>Aslan v Kopf </b>was given
by Gleeson CJ who when discussing the question involved in that case said the
following:-
<P>

"A particular application of these general principles arises in the case of
people who, in a contractual context, make mutual, or
corresponding, wills.
(People may, of course, make mutual wills in a context where there is nothing
more to it than that, and they
regard themselves as free to alter their wills
as they please or as circumstances alter). The law on this subject was
explained by
Dixon J in <b>Birmingham v Renfrew</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1937/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1937] HCA 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2057%20CLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 57 CLR 666</a> . (See
also <b>Bigg v Queensland Trustees Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%202%20Qd%20R%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 2 Qd R 11).</a>  
<P>

If two persons make mutual wills, and agree, expressly or by implication, and
either conditionally or unconditionally, not to revoke
their wills, a breach of
that agreement gives an entitlement to an equitable remedy. If the agreement is
express, equity will give
effect to it according to its tenor. If it is
implied, it will be important to identify with precision the nature of the
implied
promise.  
<P>

It may, in a particular case, and depending upon the circumstances, be proper
to conclude that the parties to an agreement to make
mutual wills by
implication agreed, unconditionally, never to revoke their wills. Ordinarily,
however, and especially when all that
is relied upon for the implication is the
conduct of the parties in making mutual wills, the proper implication is that
neither party
will revoke his or her will without notice to the others.  
<P>

.......
<P>

It was clearly arguable that there was an implied agreement between Napti, Cox
and the appellant that, so long as three of them
remained alive, no one of them
would revoke his will without giving notice to the other two. No such argument
was advanced, no doubt
for the reason that such an implication was of no
assistance to the appellant. During the lifetime of the other two and, indeed,
within a few weeks of the making of the mutual wills, Cox gave Napti and the
appellant notice that he was revoking his will."
<P>

16   	In the present case the submission of the plaintiffs
fastened upon His Honour's comments that it was clearly arguable that
there was
an implied agreement not to revoke without notice.  However, it is not apparent
what was the precise evidence relied upon
and, in any event, as notice of
revocation was given the court was more concerned with the next level, namely,
whether the agreement
was never to revoke the will.
<P>

17   	As has been mentioned above and, indeed, in may cases the
mere fact that there are corresponding wills executed simultaneously
is
relevant to, but not determinative of, the question of whether the parties
intended to enter into a legally binding agreement
to execute mutual
irrevocable wills.  Such agreement does not necessarily have to be expressed in
the language of revocation.  If
one looks at the conversations which I have set
out above there are two things that are immediately apparent.  The first is
that
none of the conversations refer to the fact that the property was to be
left to the other person prior to it being left to the children.
 The second
matter is that all the conversations address  is the contents of the wills.
There is no indication that the wills comprise
a mutually binding arrangement
between them which will not be changed.  Therefore such an agreement which is
necessary if the plaintiffs
are to succeed must result from some implication
from other facts.  The only other facts which might assist the process of
implication
are the matters pleaded in paragraph 2B of the Amended Statement of
Claim.  I myself can see no reason why delay should be a reason
for implying
the necessary condition and the only arguable matter is that which appears in
sub-paragraph (ii) of the Particulars
to paragraph 2B of the will which I have
quoted above.  
<P>

18   	If one looks at that circumstance that of itself would not
necessarily lead to the appropriate implication.  We are here dealing
with two
people who are married, living together and who have children from prior
marriages.  The ordinary experience of life would
tend to suggest that there
may be circumstances in which such children may offend a testator sufficiently
to cause a change in testamentary
intentions.  The evidence also showed that
the two deceased did not bring with them any substantial assets from their
previous marriages.
 In the circumstances the relevant property was something
which they had accumulated themselves during their marriage. 
<P>

19   	Mr McDonnell's state of mind as revealed in the
conversations only goes to the content of the wills not the question of any
relevant agreement.  I am mindful that the later conversations were shortly
before and in the knowledge of his certain death.
<P>

20   	The facts of other cases are not always helpful but I note
that the relevant evidence in <b>Hubbard v Mason </b>was described by Santow J
in these terms:-
<P>

"While binding character of such an alleged contract depends upon implying a
term not to revoke and finding consideration, each
can be found.  The words of
the alleged conversation, were that "when Bill dies Bill will leave the unit to
Ronald and Laura", with
Bill saying "that's right".  That clearly implies
Bill's last will would so provide, thus precluding revocation.  Then the
earlier
words "I have made a will leaving everything to Bill because Bill
doesn't have anywhere else to live.  If I don't leave everything
to Bill then
everything would have to be sold", imports consideration, namely that Mr
Hubbard would not revoke his will in favour
of Bill Mason."
<P>

21   	The important element of the evidence is the linking of
the operation of the will to Bill's death.  By way of contrast in
<b>Hudson v
Gray</b> (supra) the relevant evidence was described in these terms:-
<P>

"Mrs Hargrave expressed the wish that the children should only be given life
interests in the property so that the Perpetual Trustee
Co Ltd should have the
management of the property during their lives and that then their children
could be provided for.  After considerable
discussion of this question, Mr
Hargrave agreed to Mrs Hargrave's view, and so far as I can remember something
was said between them
to the effect that if he made a will leaving everything
to her for life with remainder to the children for life and then to their
children would she do the same, and she said that she would."
<P>

22   	Higgins J who was one of the majority carefully considered
this evidence and decided at p498 that even if it was accepted
it did not
amount to an agreement to revoke.  Starke J, like Isaacs J, decided the matter
on the basis that the promise did not affect
the settled property.  However,
Isaacs J considered that the conversation and the circumstances of the
execution allowed the implication
of the agreement not to revoke.
<P>

23   	In <b>Low v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd </b>(supra) the fact
that the parties were planning their affairs for when they "died" seemed to be
an important element in implying the
necessary condition.
<P>

24   	In assessing the evidence of the conversation it should be
borne in mind that there is no report of any statement by Mrs McDonnell.
 It
appears from the somewhat varied results illustrated in the cases that it may
be easier to imply the necessary condition if the
corresponding wills were made
on the deathbed of one of the testators.  The opportunity for circumstances to
arise which might lead
to revocation would be non-existent and the clear
contemplation of the parties would be the imminent death.  A similar result
would
occur if the discussions were predicated upon what would happen on a
party's death.
<P>

25   	In this case the wills were made six years before Mr
McDonnell's death.  One can assume that there was discussion between
Mr and Mrs
McDonnell at the time of making the wills about the terms of the wills.
Unfortunately, there is nothing in the two reported
conversations shortly prior
to death which suggests that Mr and Mrs McDonnell had again discussed the
matter.  Indeed, the second
conversation recounted by Lillian Jean McDonnell in
terms only confirms the advice previously given.  For all the court knows Mr
McDonnell may have been relying on the fact of the initial discussions and may
not have again discussed the matter with Mrs McDonnell.
 There is thus no
evidence that both Mr and Mrs McDonnell considered the matter after the initial
discussions which would have occurred
at the time of making the wills.  In
these circumstances one has to remove the imminence of death as one of the
relevant facts to
be considered when deciding whether or not to imply the
condition.
<P>

26   	In my view the evidence in this case does not establish
the appropriate agreement that the wills would be mutually binding
and would
not be revoked without notice.  In these circumstances I dismiss the
proceedings and order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's
costs.
