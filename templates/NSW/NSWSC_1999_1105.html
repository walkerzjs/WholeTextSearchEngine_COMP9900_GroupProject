<b><u>2258/97 NATIONAL ENGINEERING PTY LTD v CHILCO PTY LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>General Outline</b>
<P>

1   	The questions for decision are:
<P>

A.	On the summons
<P>

1.	Whether there was a contract between the plaintiff, National Engineering Pty
Ltd (National Engineering) and Chilco Pty Ltd trading
as Trojan Contractors
(Chilco) for the lease by Chilco to National Engineering of a crane to be used
in connection with the construction
of the Olympic stadium at Homebush.
<P>

2.	If there were a contract, whether it was properly terminated by National
Engineering for breach, entitling it to recover a deposit
of $144,000 paid.
<P>

B.	On the cross-claim - whether National Engineering's purported termination
amounted to a repudiation of the contract accepted
by the defendant/cross
claimant entitling it to damages for breach.
<P>

2   	If the plaintiff succeeds it is entitled to recover
$144,000 plus interest plus costs.  If the defendant succeeds in defending
the
claim, and succeeds on the cross-claim, the quantum of damages will remain to
be determined, either by me or by inquiry before
a Master.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

3   	National Engineering had a contract with Multiplex
Constructions Pty. Ltd, (Multiplex) for certain construction work on the
Olympic stadium site at Homebush.  Multiplex was the head contractor.  The work
which National Engineering had contracted to perform
required a crane of
substantial capacity to be available.
<P>

4   	Mr Ray Bradbury (Bradbury), who had been a substantial
crane operator or owner in the 1980s through various companies, which
had
suffered misfortunes, was anxious to get back into the business and secure a
presence on the Olympic site.  He knew that he or
any company he controlled
would need to have in place an enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA) to gain
any work.  To that end he
commenced negotiations with a Mr Owens in late 1996,
Mr Owens being a man who stated he could get union approval for such
agreements.
<P>

5   	In December 1996 Bradbury had discussions with Mr Favelle
of Favelle Favco Cranes about the availability of a particular crane
for the
stadium work, and later had discussions with Multiplex senior employees and Mr
Favelle with the intention of showing that
the crane National Engineering
proposed to hire was unsuitable for the work involved, thereby obtaining for
himself, a chance to
put in a quote for the work to be done with the crane.  He
arranged for Chilco to be formed or purchased for this purpose.
<P>

6   	In the course of sourcing appropriate cranes for the
stadium job, Bradbury had some discussions with persons who could provide
cranes having a capacity to lift 80 tonnes at a radius of 40 metres over a
height of 50 metres, these being, he was told, the requirements
for the
capacity of any crane.  One such supplier discussed a crawler type crane
described as a Demag CC4800.  This led to Bradbury
being contacted by Van
Seumeren (Singapore) Pte Limited, (Van Seumeren), a large world-wide crane
owner and hirer, as a result of
which Van Seumeren provided details and
subsequently hiring charges for a crane known as an MDC 3500.  This was an 800
tonne crane,
being one capable of a vertical lift at minimum radius of 800
tonnes.
<P>

7   	At about the same time, namely in January 1997, Bradbury
obtained details of the Demag 4800 including relevant load charts,
which he
discussed with Mr Burns (Burns) the general manager of National Engineering and
later lent to him for detailed perusal.
<P>

8   	Discussions between Bradbury and Burns revealed that it
would be necessary for a tender to be put in at under $1,500,000 for
it to be
successful.  There were negotiations between Bradbury and Van Seumeren along
those lines as a result of which Bradbury obtained
offers from Van Seumeren all
relating to the MDC 3500 crane type which was an 800 tonne capacity crane but
which was truck mounted.
 The tender offers received from Van Seumeren provided
that the contract would be placed with whatever subsidiary it nominated, within
its worldwide organisation.  On 25 January Bradbury sent to Burns an offer to
supply "a 800 tonne heavy lift crane for the Olympic
2000 site at Homebush
NSW".  Terms as to payment and the like were included.  The tender price of
$1,600,000 was for a six month
hire period based on an average week of sixty
hours and included cost of assembly and disassembly.  This was rejected by
National
Engineering as being outside its price range, but suggesting an
acceptable price as $1,440,000 and on 27 January 1997 Bradbury put
forward a
revised tender based on that lower figure.
<P>

9   	There can be no doubt that at this stage Burns believed
that the tender related to a Demag CC4800 crawler crane because that
was the
last crane discussed between him and Bradbury, and equally there can be no
doubt that the crane which Van Seumeren proposed
to supply to Chilco was the
MDC 3500 crane in accordance with its offer document.
<P>

10   	At this time Van Seumeren had a Demag 4800 under hire to
BHP at Port Hedland in Western Australia and there were discussions
about
bringing that crane to the Olympic site after it was finished at Port Hedland.
It seems from the evidence that there would
have been considerable difficulty
with this in view of the import licence restrictions and the requirements for
sales tax if that
crane were not exported by a time earlier than the conclusion
of the six months' hire for the Olympic site.  The fact that National
Engineering thought that the quote from Bradbury on behalf of Chilco was in
respect of the Demag CC4800 crawler crane is made perfectly
clear by a letter
of intent issued by National Engineering to Chilco Contracting on 28 January
1997, which commences as follows:
<P>

Ray,
<P>

<b>Re:	Hire of Demag CC4800</b>
<P>

We wish to advise our intent to enter into a contract with Trojan for the hire
of the Demag CC4800 Crawler Crane as quoted in your
fax dated 27.1.97.
<P>

11   	The next day, namely 29 January 1997, there was a meeting
between Bradbury and Messrs Bakker and Robinson on behalf of Van
Seumeren.  Mr
Robinson was apparently in charge of the crane at Port Hedland.  After that
meeting the three of them went to the Homebush
site to inspect it and to talk
to Burns.  After that Bakker and Robinson had a discussion with Mr Rolls, who
was apparently a site
manager for Multiplex.  It later turned out that
Multiplex was for some unexplained reason very concerned about having Bradbury
or
any of his employees on the site.  Burns said, and I accept, that at the
meeting he was told by the Van Seumeren people that they
were not guaranteeing
that a Demag CC4800 crane would be available, but was told that they had ten
cranes around the world which
could do the job and one of these would be made
available.  It was for this reason he said, and I accept, that a revised letter
of
intent was issued to Chilco, the first paragraph of which was as follows:
<P>

Further to our discussions on site of 31/1/97, we wish to reconfirm and advise
our intent to enter into a contract with Trojan for
the hire of the Demag
CC4800 Crawler Crane or equivalent as quoted in your fax dated 27.1.97.
<P>

If there were a contract, it is this document which was the first of the
contract documents.  It is of some significance so I will
set it out in
full.
<P>

3rd February 1997
<P>

Trojan Contracting
<P>

Attention:  Mr Ray Bradbury
<P>

Fax No: 02 9252 4634
<P>

Ray,
<P>

RE:  HIRE OF Demag CC4800
<P>

Further to our discussions on site on 31/1/97 we wish to re-confirm and advise
our intent to enter into a contract with Trojan for
the hire of a Demag CC4800
Crawler Crane or equivalent as quoted in your fax dated 27.1.97.
<P>

We confirm the agreed costs of $1,440,000.00 for hire of the crane for a period
of 6 months commencing 14th July 1997.
<P>

We wish to confirm our understanding of issues discussed with you in regard to
the crane hire:
<P>

1.	Van Seumeren as the crane's owner will provide an unconditional guarantee of
the crane's availability for the stated hire period.
 This guarantee is to take
the form of a letter to both National Engineering and Multiplex Constructions
guaranteeing that the crane
will meet all required commitments.  When freight
arrangements for the delivery of the crane have been finalised, Van Seumeren
will
provide regular updates of the progress of the delivery to ensure that the
delivery date will be met.
<P>

2.	Van Seumeren as the crane's owner would be prepared allow Multiplex
Constructions to take over the crane hire under the crane
conditions in the
event of National Engineering being unable to complete its contractual
responsibilities.
<P>

3.	The crane would be supplied with 66 m main boom, 90 m luffing fly, 200 tonne
superlift counterweight, all lifting blocks and
hooks necessary to complete a
320 tonne lift, and basic lifting tackle and chains suitable for general
erection work up to 20 tonne
lifts.
<P>

4.	Trojan and/or Van Seumeren will satisfy all requirements of Multiplex
Project Manager with regard to personnel on site.  Such
requirements will
include but not be limited to EBA's and other site related issues.
<P>

5.	Included in the hire cost are the following:
<P>

	
<P>

	-	Insurance of the crane itself
<P>

	-	Public liability insurance
<P>

	-	60 hours maximum operation per week.
<P>

	-	Crane driver, support labour and technical 			supervisor.  The crane driver
is to be employed 			under certified EBA signed by
the CFMEU.
<P>

	-	All freight to and from the site.
<P>

	-	All assembly and disassembly cranage and 			rigging labour.
<P>

	-	6 months operating time taken from completion 			of mobilisation to
commencement of 				demobilisation.
<P>

	-	All maintenance costs for the crane.  Any 			substantial breakdown of the
crane would be 			compensated by an equivalent lengthening
of the
<P>

		hire period.
<P>

	-	All WorkCover approvals for the operation of the 		crane.
<P>

6.	With reasonable notice National Engineering would have the right to extend
the hire period for the crane.
<P>

Upon confirmation of these issues we will proceed to enter into a formal
contract.
<P>

Please allocate the crane for the period state based on this letter of
intent.
<P>

We look forward to a successful involvement of your company in this project.
<P>

Yours faithfully
<P>

Peter Burns
<P>

General Manager
<P>

12   	On 3 February, Bradbury wrote to Van Seumeren in Singapore
referring to the last quote from that company and stating 
<P>

Enclosed is a copy of the quotation from Trojan to National Engineering and on
acceptance of the above National Engineering and
Trojan will enter into a
formal contract and Trojan will formalise its contract with Van Seumeren as per
our discussions.
<P>

P.S. Please note the crane model and/or its equivalent.
<P>

13   	On 5 February Bradbury wrote to Burns at National
Engineering saying:
<P>

I would like to confirm that Trojan - Van Seumeren have satisfied all party
[sic] involved that your letter of intent and Trojan
quotation for us to supply
the heavy lift crane is acceptable.
<P>

Please issue Trojan with a National Engineering order number which will keep
all parties comfortable with the arrangement ...
<P>

14   	On 5 February National Engineering issued a purchase order
to Trojan Contracting for the "supply of Demag CC4800 crane or
equivalent for 6
months hire as per letter of intent dated 3/2/97."  On 5 February Mr Bakker of
Van Seumeren wrote to Bradbury stating
that any order or letter of intent
issued to Van Seumeren should contain certain details, and commented on the
letter of 3 February
and on the requirements in the National Engineering letter
of intent.  On 7 February 1997 Van Seumeren Australia Pty Limited sent
a fax
message to its solicitors asking them to prepare a draft agreement between Van
Seumeren Australia and Trojan for the supply
of the crane in accordance with
the terms agreed.  There followed inquiries by Bradbury about the cost of
bringing the CC4800 crane,
which was at Port Hedland to Sydney.
<P>

15   	In the middle of February various discussions took place
and there was correspondence received by Chilco from Burns about
construction
details and layout of the Homebush site, and there were also continuing
attempts by Bradbury to get Mr Owens moving
on the required enterprise
bargaining agreement.  Bradbury had paid $3,000 to Mr Owens to obtain this, but
it seemed that the co-operation
of Mr Childs in the relevant union office was
required.  During this time also a schedule of payments for the order was
agreed and
the first payment referred to as the deposit was paid on 21
February.
<P>

16   	At the beginning of March Bradbury was contacting various
crane operators around the world, seeking details of cranes that
might be
available to do the job.  This has little relevance other than it does not
reflect particularly well on Bradbury because
it is clear that if there was a
contract in existence it was to provide a Van Seumeren crane.
<P>

17   	On about 10 March Mr Bakker and Mr Maddison came to Sydney
again and were involved in some direct discussions on the Homebush
site with
National Engineering.  It seems that during those discussions Mr Bakker said
that the CC4800 crane would not be available
and discussions took place about
the availability of another crane.  There were also discussions between
Bradbury and Burns about
the availability of the EBA.  At this time also a
suggestion was made to Bradbury by Mr Maddison that he should accept the
deposit
which had been paid and "walk away from the job".  Subsequently a
further meeting was held when there was a further suggestion that
Bradbury take
$278,000 and give up the job.
<P>

18   	By this time National Engineering had commenced putting
pressure on Bradbury as to identification of the appropriate crane
and the
availability of the EBA.  On 13 March Burns wrote about these matters and
further stated that the commencement date for pre-assembly
of arch units had
been postponed because the required lifting positions were not available.  The
identity of the crane type was relevant
to the pouring of foundations for
sub-assembly framework because different cranes would have lifted the arches
from different positions.
 The letter also required information about the EBA
and the identity of employees and their competency to be provided within
fourteen
days of the date of the letter.  Bradbury sent a copy of this fax to
Mr Bakker saying that he had a copy of the EBA and an early
meeting to have it
signed.  The former statement at least was not correct.  Multiplex wrote to
National Engineering on 17 March setting
out certain of its requirements which
included an unconditional guarantee from Van Seumeren in favour of Multiplex
confirming that
the CC4800 crane would be available, and that the hire
agreement would be novated to Multiplex in the event of National Engineering
not completing its contractual obligations with Multiplex and the requirement
for the EBA from Chilco, and the site layout for the
pre-assembly work.
Multiplex asked for that documentation by 24 March.  A copy of that letter was
sent by Burns to Bradbury on 18
March requiring response from Van Seumeren of a
guarantee of the availability of the 4800 crawler crane or equivalent for the
stated
hire period, and a requirement that if that crane or its equivalent
could not be guaranteed they needed to have that advised to them
immediately by
Van Seumeren.  They also required confirmation as to whether there was any
contract between Chilco and Van Seumeren
for the supply of any crane.  Once
again they required an EBA and employee information.  Bradbury replied on 19
March stating he
believed he would have the EBA signed off by the union that
day.  He pointed out that even the fourteen days allowed by the letter
of 13
March had not expired, and said that between Chilco and Van Seumeren a "mostly
written and also verbal contract exists".  On
20 March Van Seumeren sent a fax
message to National Engineering stating that it could not provide an
unconditional guarantee "that
our <u>Demag CC4800</u> will be available on site
on 14.07.1997 at Homebush, Australia", and also stating that there was no
written contract, but there was
a verbal contract for an MDC 3500 800 tonne
truck mounted lattice boom crane.  At the same time Van Seumeren sent a
quotation to
Bradbury for the supply of a Demag CC2600 crawler crane, but
whatever the relevance of that, the offer was not accepted.  On 21 March,
National Engineering through Burns by facsimile to Chilco stated that Van
Seumeren had advised it could not supply the <u>Demag CC4800 crane or
equivalent</u> and that Van Seumeren had stated that the MDC 3500 crane was
inadequate, that the Demag CC2600 crane might be available and could
lift all
arch lifts and carry out eighteen out of twenty-two of the roof infill lifts.
National Engineering however, did offer to
take the Demag crane under certain
conditions, which were not acceptable to Bradbury, who made a counter proposal
on 24 March.  (The
underlining is my emphasis).
<P>

19   	On 25 March National Engineering by facsimile to Bradbury
at Chilco wrote as follows:
<P>

It is the opinion of our company that Trojan Contracting is unable to meet its
contractual obligations.
<P>

Accordingly we hereby terminate our agreement with Trojan Contracting effective
immediately ...
<P>

There followed a demand for repayment of the deposit of $144,000.  Also on 25
March Burns rejected an offer from Chilco in respect
of the CC2600.  On 27
March Van Seumeren wrote to Bradbury by fax stating that as National
Engineering had terminated its contract
with Chilco "any agreement between Van
Seumeren and Chilco for supply of the crane must also be regarded as
terminated".  The message
went on to say that National Engineering had
approached Van Seumeren direct and they considered themselves free to contract
the supply
with the required crane, which was the CC2600, which in fact was
never supplied, or used on the site.  By response of 27 March to
National
Engineering Bradbury rejected the claim that Chilco could not meet its
contractual obligations and confirmed it could supply
an 800 tonne crane as
contracted, and stated that if National Engineering wished to terminate the
contract, then Chilco would be
entitled to damages well in excess of the
deposit.  Whether or not that amounted to an acceptance of the termination as
an improper
repudiation may not be quite clear but there can be no doubt that
became the position upon the filing of the cross-claim.
<P>

<b>Pleadings</b>
<P>

20   	The matter commenced by summons under which National
Engineering sought a declaration that it was entitled to the whole of
the
deposit, some amount by that time having been taken from the account.
Unfortunately, due to the way the matter progressed, the
court did not require
the plaintiff's claim to be pleaded, although the cross-claim of Chilco was
properly pleaded.  Nevertheless
as argued the claim of the plaintiff was as
follows:
<P>

1.	That there was no binding contract between National Engineering and Chilco
and therefore the amount of the deposit with interest
was repayable.
<P>

2.	In the alternative, if there were a binding contract, then the contract was
terminated by National Engineering for breach, the
breach claimed being either
(1) breach of conditions of the contract that (a) submission of the EBA and
employee details, and (b)
confirmation of the availability of an appropriate
crane to be provided under the contract be available within a reasonable time,
or (2) anticipatory breach being the inability of Chilco to perform the
contract at the due date, namely 14 July 1997 or to comply
with the conditions
within a reasonable time to ensure start on the due date.
<P>

21   	The claim of Chilco under the cross-claim is that it had a
contract and that the purported termination for breach was improper
and
amounted to a repudiation, which was accepted by Chilco resulting in loss to
Chilco. In addition, there is a claim by Chilco
for unconscionable conduct
under s51AA of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></u> which relies as its basis
upon a claim that National Engineering, having determined to keep Chilco off
the site in accordance with
the desire of Multiplex and being prepared to
negotiate direct with Van Seumeren, engaged in unconscionable conduct.  It was
accepted
the pleaded case under s51AB of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></u> must
fail. The final claim under the cross-claim is that National Engineering
induced Van Seumeren to breach the contract between
Chilco and Van Seumeren.
The claims in paragraph 23 of the cross-claim so far they were for misleading
and deceptive conduct under
ss51A and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">52</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></u> were
abandoned.  It is necessary to deal with these matters in turn. 
<P>

<b>Was there a contract?</b>
<P>

22   	I consider that there was and that its terms were
contained in the letter of intent of 3 February 1997, the confirmation of
5
February 1997 and the purchase order of that same date.  Thereafter the parties
clearly conducted themselves upon the basis of
there being a contract.  This is
evidenced by their actions including agreement on payment terms, the payment of
the deposit, National
Engineering seeking advice on construction layouts,
National Engineering making demands for compliance with the terms as to the EBA
and guarantee of availability, and by the references by National Engineering to
"the continuation of this contract for crane hire
is in serious doubt" "our
original contract for the supply of a Demag CC4800 cannot proceed" the offer of
alternative terms and conditions
"to restructure the contract to suit the
alternative crane", the "spirit in which the original contract was entered
into;" and finally
the terms of the letter of termination I have set out.  Mr.
Burns agreed there was a deal.  It is clear both parties regarded themselves
as
bound even if it were intended to have a more formal document at a later stage.
I find there was a contract.
<P>

<b>Was the plaintiff entitled to terminate for breach?</b>
<P>

23   	The plaintiff says that what are described as issues in
the letter of intent of 3 February 1997 were conditions of contract
which had
to be complied with within a reasonable time, that the reasonable time was the
time when the footings for the pre-assembly
work were to be poured, that being
13 March 1997, and that Bradbury knew of this important date.  In other words,
the plaintiff says
that the period from 3 February 1997 to 13 March 1997 was a
reasonable time for compliance with the two matters of substance relied
upon
for breach, namely failure to provide an unconditional guarantee of crane
availability and the requirement to satisfy Multiplex
as to the personnel to be
engaged on the site and the availability of the required EBA.
<P>

24   	The hire was to commence on 14 July 1997.  I accept that
Chilco was required to satisfy National Engineering as to its requirements
within a reasonable time to give it certainty that the crane would be on site
able to commence work by 14 July 1997.  However, the
idea that 13 March was the
time by which those conditions were to be fulfilled was, as far as I can
establish, first advanced by
counsel for the plaintiff in final submissions.
On any basis that date was not an agreed date nor an essential date, and if it
were
reasonable to set a time limit after that date, being the fourteen days
specified in the letter of 13 March, then the notice of termination
was given
two days before the expiry of that fourteen days.  Thus I do not consider that
there was any basis on which to find satisfaction
of the conditions by 13 March
was a term of the contract, and, in the circumstances of a contract for hire
commencing on 14 July
1997, I do not consider that fourteen days' notice to
comply after 13 March, was a reasonable time, even if 13 March was a fixed
date
but not an essential date.  In any event, as I have said, it does not matter
because the plaintiff purported to terminate the
contract prior to the
expiration of that time.
<P>

25   	I turn to anticipatory breach.  The plaintiff seemed to
embrace this rather late, which reinforces the desirability of pleadings
in all
but the most obvious cases.  However, the letter of termination is based on
inability to perform.  At its most simple the
question is whether at the date
of purported termination Chilco was unable to comply with the contract.
However, contrary to the
submissions of counsel for Chilco, it is not a case of
merely having to decide whether Chilco was unable to perform as at 14 July
1997.  The plaintiff was entitled before that time to be assured the EBA was in
place, and to have the provision of an appropriate
crane guaranteed and the
agreement to novate in place.  Thus the question is whether the plaintiff has
established that at termination,
these conditions could not have been fulfilled
within a reasonable time.  I do not consider that the plaintiff has established
that
the requirements of Multiplex set out in its letter of 17 March were
reasonable and justified.
<P>

26   	To establish anticipatory breach National Engineering must
show that at the time of termination Chilco was disabled from performing
the
contract:  <b><cite>Universal Cargo Carrier Corporation v Citati</cite></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%202%20QB%20401" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 2 QB 401</a>; <b><cite>Sunbird Plaza Pty Ltd v Maloney</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20166%20CLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 166
CLR 245</a> at 267 and 280.  That requires proof of disablement to comply with the
relevant conditions 1 to 4 of the letter of intent within
a sufficiently
reasonable time to ensure that hire could commence on 14 July 1997.  It has not
been established 13 March was a reasonable
time or what was a reasonable time.
I do not consider I need determine it.  It is certain it has not been shown
Chilco was disabled
from obtaining the EBA within a reasonable time.  The
provision of the crane is more difficult.  The Van Seumeren fax of 20 March
says nothing about an equivalent crane.  There was certainly a possibility that
at the date of purported termination Bradbury would
have been able to prevail
upon Van Seumeren to provide an equivalent crane and to give a guarantee to do
so within a reasonable time.
<P>

27   	I should add that I do not accept the argument of Chilco
that it could have provided an appropriate crane through another
provider as an
answer.  The contract with National Engineering was subject to an implied, if
not express, term that the crane would
come through Van Seumeren.  
<P>

28   	The result of this is that National Engineering has not
established breach entitling it to terminate so that its purported
termination
amounted to a repudiation which the cross-claimant was entitled to accept,
which it did.  This leads of course to a consideration
of the cross-claim for
breach of contract.  
<P>

<b>Cross claim for damages on acceptance of repudiation</b>
<P>

29   	In view of my previous finding, Chilco is entitled to
succeed on its claim for breach of contract and is entitled to some
damages for
breach, even if nominal.  This was accepted and although I have been
sidetracked for a time in considering the detailed
judgment in <b><cite>Foran v
Wight</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%20385" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 385</a> on the question of anticipatory breach and
the requirement for the terminating party to be "ready, willing and able" to
perform before
breach as opposed to damages can be found that position does not
arise here and was not argued.
<P>

30   	While it is not part of the present hearing to determine
the quantum of damages, it is desirable to make some reference to
this in the
hope that the matter may be concluded with as little cost as possible.  The
claim of Chilco to any substantial damages
under the cross-claim depends upon a
finding that it would have been able to perform the contract.  On the
particulars furnished
its claim extends not only to damages for loss of the
profit it would have made on that contract, but for loss of other moneys it
claims it would have received had it performed the particular contract through
some flow on benefits.  There is a positive onus on
Chilco, if it is to succeed
on a claim for loss of profits and more, to show on the balance of
probabilities that it would have been
able to perform the contract and to
fulfil the conditions to which it was subject prior to the commencement.  The
loss must flow
from the breach through repudiation.  It is not a case of loss
of chance.  Thus Chilco would be required to show on the balance of
probabilities that it would have been able to provide through Van Seumeren a
Demag CC4800 crane or its equivalent and obtain a guarantee
of this in
reasonable time.  The words "or equivalent" are not an industry term of art,
but I accept the evidence of Burns that the
words relate to "capacity, mobility
and efficiency or speed of lifting operations".  Evidence is that the MDC 3500
crane, the type
that Van Seumeren had stated to Chilco it would provide, is not
an equivalent crane.  A wheel mounted, as opposed to a crawler crane,
is not an
equivalent crane for the required job.  The evidence established that the Demag
CC2600 crane, while it could possibly carry
out all the lifting requirements,
was not an equivalent crane.  It was difficult for Bradbury to say it was as it
was a 500 tonne
crane, and he had insisted on an 800 tonne requirement.  It
would require position change to do the job if in fact it could do it
at all.
In any event the terms on which it was offered were rejected by Chilco and
there is no basis on which it would be possible
to determine that even if it
were an equivalent crane, it would have been available to Chilco through Van
Seumeren on terms which
would have given a profit to Chilco and been accepted
by that company.  It is not necessary to go further at this stage.  I have
gone
this far to explain the difficulties which confront Chilco in its claim for
special as opposed to nominal damages.
<P>

31   	It follows from this that as the claim of the plaintiff
for refund of the deposit was based, in the event of my finding there
was a
contract, upon breach of the contract by Chilco, that claim must be dismissed,
there being no such finding and no total failure
of consideration.  On the
cross-claim there should be a finding that National Engineering repudiated the
contract and that the cross-claimant
is entitled to damages for such
repudiation having accepted it.  Such damages can probably best be determined
by me, rather than
a Master and if it is necessary I will fix a date for that
after the parties have considered these reasons.  As I have said a question
will arise as to whether the cross-claimant is entitled to anything above
nominal damages.
<P>

<b>Claim under s51AA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a></b>
<P>

32   	It is almost impossible to understand the pleaded claim
for unconscionable conduct.  Paragraph 23 of the amended cross-claim
for the
most part relates to a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct under ss 51A
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">52</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></u>, which was abandoned.  The particulars
furnished for paragraph 23 might be appropriate to a claim for inducement of
breach of contract,
but it is difficult to see how they could give rise to some
separate claim under s51AA.
<P>

33   	The argument of counsel for the cross-claimant was that
having entered into a contract with Chilco, National Engineering took
steps to
ensure that the contract could not be performed, so that it could in some way
obtain some advantage for itself in dealing
direct with Van Seumeren.  This of
course is more relevant to a claim for inducement of breach of contract.
Chilco was a company
newly formed for the purpose of attempting to obtain work
on the Olympic site.  It was controlled by Bradbury, who was a man who
was well
versed in the crane and construction business, albeit that he had had fallen
into financial difficulties.  It would be extraordinarily
difficult in such
circumstances to say that Chilco was under some special disability or
disadvantage and that some generalised claim
for damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s82</a> or other
relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> could be brought based on some
claim for unconscionable conduct.  Among other things it ought to be borne in
mind that Bradbury,
after he entered into the contract with National
Engineering for the provision of a crane through Van Seumeren, was busy making
inquiries
about cranes from other sources.  For any claim for unconscionable
conduct to succeed it is necessary to bring it within the principles
enunciated
in cases such as <b><cite>Blomley v Ryan</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2099%20CLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 99 CLR 362</a>;

Such a claim cannot be used as
some sort of substitute for damages for breach of contract.
<P>

<b>Claim for inducing breach of contract</b>
<P>

34   	The allegation is that National Engineering induced Van
Seumeren to breach its contract with Chilco for the supply of a crane.
 The
first requirement to make good this claim is the existence of a binding
contract between Chilco and Van Seumeren.  It is unlikely
there was any such
binding contract and I would have come to that conclusion were it not for the
letter from Van Seumeren to National
Engineering admitting that there was in
existence a verbal contract for the provision of the MDC 3500 800 tonne truck
mounted crane.
 Whether the fax from Mr Bakker to National Engineering of 20
March 1997 would amount to an admission of a binding oral contract
is not quite
clear.  However, in my view, that does not matter because the contract for an
MDC 3500 crane would not have been of
any benefit to Chilco because it would
not have fulfilled the requirements of its contract with National Engineering.
There was no
binding contract for supply of a Demag CC4800 crane or equivalent.
Thus even if it were established that National Engineering had
procured the
breach of the admitted contract no damage to Chilco would have flowed.  On that
basis the claim, being a claim in tort,
would be dismissed in any event in the
absence of damage.  It is probably desirable to proceed a little bit further.
The pleaded
claim is that National Engineering commenced negotiating direct
with Van Seumeren for the supply of a crane.  There is no evidence
that it did
so before 25 March 1997, although it is clear there were meetings between the
representatives of National Engineering
and Van Seumeren to the exclusion of
Chilco, and certainly Van Seumeren was made aware, either by National
Engineering or directly
by Multiplex employees, that there was a desire to keep
Bradbury and persons associated with him away from the Olympic site.  The
reasons for this were never explained.  Suspicion in these circumstances does
not amount to proof.  The unavailability of the Demag
CC4800 crane operating at
Port Hedland has not been shown to have occurred through any interference
whatever by National Engineering.
 In fact it has not been established why that
crane was not available.  This claim must fail.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

35   	The plaintiff's summons claims declarations that the
deposit of $144,000 was held in trust for it and that withdrawals from
the
account into which the deposit was placed were in breach of trust.  No basis
was put forward for such trust claim, unless there
were no contract, other than
that the amount was repayable upon termination of the contract for breach.
That claim has failed.  No
other issue was raised about those moneys and the
court should not invent one.  Some amount has been expended by Chilco and
approximately
$72,000 is admitted to be remaining, held in an account upon
which Bradbury is sole signatory.  I should just dismiss the summons.

<P>

36   	The orders that I would propose are as follows:
<P>

<u>On the summons</u>
<P>

1.	Summons dismissed with costs.
<P>

<u>On the cross-claim</u>
<P>

1.	Declare that the cross-claimant is entitled to damages against the
cross-defendant for breach of contract as claimed and order
that a date be
fixed for the determination of such damages.  Cross-claim otherwise dismissed.

<P>

2.	Costs of cross-claim reserved until its final determination.
<P>

I will stand the matter over for a few days for the parties to consider these
reasons and to bring in draft minutes of order and
directions as to the balance
of the proceedings.
