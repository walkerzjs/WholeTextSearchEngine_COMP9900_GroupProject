<b><u>NEWCASTLE:	146/96:    PRITCHARD  v  PORT WARATAH COAL SERVICES
LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is a claim for damages for
personal injuries brought by the plaintiff who was at the time of an alleged
incident, an employee
of the defendant. While the plaintiff's case is primarily
based upon an allegation that the subject accident occurred because the
system
of work in which he was engaged was unsafe because a motor vehicle was involved
in the incident, the case falls within the
purview of the <b>Motor Accidents
Act</b> 1988 as amended.
<P>

2   	The subject accident is alleged to have occurred on
Saturday, 3 July 1993 at about 1.30 pm. At that time the plaintiff was
employed
by the defendant as a plant operator. His duties involved driving machinery
operated by the defendant including frontend
loaders, fork lifts and similar
devices.
<P>

3   	On Saturday, 3 July 1993 the plaintiff was directed by his
supervisor, who apparently was a Mr Selby Green, to assist a fellow
plant
operator, a Mr Leonard Marks, to pick up scrap material from the defendant's
yard. That scrap material consisted of off-cuts
from machinery upgrades and
included steel pipes, flat steel plate, angle iron, girders and rollers. To
perform the task a Hiab crane
truck was utilised.
<P>

4   	Marks was driving the crane and the plaintiff was acting as
a crane chaser. The truck itself was of the type known as a flat
bed truck and
the crane was mounted on its rear. As may be gained from the description of the
metallic objects to be picked up they
were irregular in shape.
<P>

5   	The operation being carried out consisted of the truck
being driven around the yard and the crane being utilised to lift the
metallic
objects on to the bed of the truck. To prevent the off-cuts sliding off the
truck when it was in motion, steel bars were
placed around the side of the
truck - it being a flat bed truck it had no sides around its tray. From time to
time the truck would
drive alongside bins which were located in the yard and
the metallic objects were hooked to the crane by the plaintiff after which
Marks would operate the crane to deposit the scrap metal into the bins. When
the scrap metal had been placed in the bin the plaintiff
would then unhook the
crane and the process of picking up and loading the truck would recommence.
<P>

6   	It was the plaintiff's case that the following method was
employed to move the scrap metal from the body of the truck into
the bin. The
plaintiff would stand on the flat bed and hook the chains which were underneath
the pieces of scrap metal to the crane.
The plaintiff alleged that he was
standing in a position on the truck's bed where Marks could see him. The crane
would then be operated
so that initially the weight of the load would be taken
up by the crane and when it appeared to be secure then the crane would be
operated to lift the load from the bed of the truck into the skip.
<P>

7   	On one such occasion the plaintiff deposed that the
following occurred:
<P>

<i>"Q.  And as he proceeded to lift, what happened?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Well, as he proceeded to lift, the load underneath started to slide -
the pipe must have been holding it in place. As he had taken
the heavy weights
off, the sheets beneath started to slide and slid towards me. I thought I was
going to have my foot crushed, so
I jumped off the back of the truck."</i>
<P>

8   	In jumping off the side of the truck the plaintiff landed
in a manner which he described as doing the splits. He immediately
felt a pain
in his left groin. However, as the shift which he was working was nearing an
end the plaintiff decided to complete the
shift. He said nothing to Marks at
the time when the incident occurred about any injury occurring to him but at
the completion of
the shift he discussed the matter with Marks while they were
heading to the showers.
<P>

9   	Marks' account of the events of the afternoon of 3 July was
not inconsistent with that of the plaintiff. In chief Marks had
this to say
about the observation he made of the plaintiff while the plaintiff was on the
truck:
<P>

<i>"Q.  But until he got off the truck would it be necessary for you to watch
him?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Oh, he could be out of my sight around the other side of the
truck.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  That is when he was off the truck?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  I am talking about until he got off the truck, was it necessary for you
to watch him?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Oh, not really necessary. I'd be just watching the - not really, no,
once everything was hooked up and right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Well, what happened after it was hooked up and you commenced to lift the
load?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  What happens?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Well, I'd just slew it off the truck and around into the bin.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.  When would you do that in relation to where Mr Pritchard was?</i>
<P>

<i>A.  Well, all depends. If you had a load that was swinging around the crane
chaser could get on the same side as me on the truck and
just guide it off the
truck, or otherwise, if it was just a small load, he'd just get down off the
truck into a safe spot where I
could see him and then I'd slew it off into the
bin."</i>
<P>

10   	Marks recalled that the plaintiff had told him when they
were heading towards the showers that he had hurt his groin when
he had jumped
off the truck.
<P>

11   	In these circumstances, despite a challenge being made to
the plaintiff's evidence on the basis that the accident did not
occur on that
day, I accept the version given by the plaintiff.
<P>

12   	Expert reports were tendered on behalf of both the
plaintiff and the defendant. Dr Adams, an ergonomic and safety expert,
expressed the view that the risk of part of an oddly associated load of the
type involved here, moving as it was being lifted, was
a possibility which
should have been anticipated by the defendant.
<P>

13   	He pointed to a number of preventative measures which he
thought could reasonably have been put in place. These included:
<P>

1.	The use of two trucks, namely the one which was utilised and a tip truck.
The crane on the flat bed truck being used to lift
scrap metal off the yard
directly into the tip truck thus obviating the need to unload the material into
skips as the tip truck,
when full, could be driven to a dump.
<P>

2.	That Marks and the plaintiff should have been directed to carry out their
tasks in several stages so that only similar items
would be picked up and
unloaded during each complete stage.
<P>

3.	That sufficient chains and cables should have been provided so that the
bundle of scrap could be so lashed that the load would
have been less likely to
slide.
<P>

14   	Dr Adams also made comments about the observations which
Marks should have made while driving the crane. However, I need not
go into
those.
<P>

15   	Dr Olsen, another expert in the same field as Dr Adams,
had been given a somewhat different version of events. However, he
concluded as
follows:
<P>

<i>"If the version given by Dr Adams is correct in that the crane driver
elevated the load whilst the crane chaser remained on the back
of the truck,
then there was an unsafe system of work. This would be so on the basis that the
load shifting can occur and given the
relatively confined area on the rear of
the truck, it is better safety practice for the crane chaser to get off the
truck prior to
actually lifting the load."</i>
<P>

16   	Accepting as I do the version given by the plaintiff it is
plain in my view, that the system of work being utilised on the
day in question
was unsafe. Because it is my view that the plaintiff suffered injury in the
accident I am thus driven to the conclusion
that the plaintiff has succeeded in
establishing that the defendant was in breach of his duty to take reasonable
care for his safety
and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the matter.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff's case was that the injury he had suffered
was one to his adductor longus tendon and his symphysis pubis as
a result of
the accident. There is in fact little dispute that the plaintiff suffered such
an injury.
<P>

18   	Dr R Opie, general surgeon, described his injury in these
terms:
<P>

<i>"Mr Pritchard's accident on 3/7/1993 caused a tear and possibly a partial
avulsion of the adductor longus tendon at its attachment
to the pubis."</i>
<P>

19   	The issue which emerged was not that the plaintiff had
such an injury but in the light of his activities as a soccer player
whether
the disability he undoubtedly suffers is related to the accident of 3 July 1993
or to his sporting activities. 
<P>

20   	I should add that the plaintiff also suffers from a
condition of plantar fasciitis which has been brought about by the plaintiff
favouring his right leg over his left as a consequence of his groin injury.
<P>

21   	I then turn to the plaintiff's post injury activities.
Evidence was led from him, in chief, that he continued on at work after
the
accident and indeed played soccer on a reasonably regular basis  in 1993, 1994
and 1995. He denied suffering any frank injury
to his groin while playing
soccer either before or after the incident on 3 July 1993.
<P>

22   	His case was that he expected that the injury would
resolve in time and that he continued as far as possible to carry out
normal
activities. However, as time went by his injury not only did not improve but
deteriorated.
<P>

23   	While he returned to work on Monday 5 July 1993 he in fact
saw a general practitioner, Dr Kochanski on 6 July 1993 who, while
not making a
specific diagnosis of the exact nature of the plaintiff's injury, put him off
work for two weeks and directed that he
have physiotherapy. The plaintiff
undertook such treatment.
<P>

24   	He returned to work on 19 July 1993 on restricted duties.
He continued to work until October 1994 when following another incident
at work
in which he injured his right elbow and shoulder. He was off work for some
three months. This, of course, is totally unrelated
to the injury under
review.
<P>

25   	However, when he returned to duties in February 1995 he
continued this time carrying out, as I understand his evidence, normal
duties
but with persistent pain in his groin.
<P>

26   	In November 1995 there was a substantial exacerbation of
that pain which arose as a result of no particular incident. However,
he, as a
result in a change in his duties in early 1995 that is after his return from
his shoulder and arm injury, he was required
to climb on to the top of large
items of equipment. One such item known as a stacker required him to climb, by
utilising a combination
of stairs and ladders, about ten flights, taking him
about 100 feet from the ground. Similar climbing was involved when he had to
work on an item of equipment known as a reclaimer.
<P>

27   	He observed that the climbing caused an increase in the
pain in his groin. Following the exacerbation in mid 1995 he had been
referred
to an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr P Mitchell who diagnosed the adductor longus
tendon injury plus the symphysis pubic damage.
<P>

28   	As time went by the pain caused the plaintiff to miss time
from work so much so that by letter dated 25 March 1998 the defendant
company
wrote to him advising him that his absenteeism was unacceptable.
<P>

29   	By July 1999 the plaintiff found it impossible to continue
his duties and indeed his general practitioner certified that he
was unfit for
his duties. As I have indicated earlier there is no dispute that the plaintiff
is unfit for his pre-injury duties.
<P>

30   	Dr M Tarrant who saw the plaintiff on behalf of the
defendant, while acknowledging the existence of the plaintiff's injury,
was
somewhat suspicious as to the aetiology of the injury having regard to his
sporting endeavours in 1993 through to 1995.
<P>

31   	Dr R Opie, who had originally opined on 7 May 1998 that
the plaintiff's prognosis for a full recovery was doubtful and that
his
condition was caused by the incident on 3 July 1993, felt, when advised of the
plaintiff's soccer playing activities from 1993
through to 1995, that he had
made a full recovery from his injuries and that it was no longer possible to
ascribe his present condition
to the episode of 3 July 1993.
<P>

32   	Dr Mitchell, who has been his treating specialist, has
suggested that surgery may be of assistance to him although the plaintiff
has
indicated to Dr Mitchell that he is not agreeable to surgical intervention. Dr
Mitchell is of the view that the plaintiff is
now fit only for sedentary
work.
<P>

33   	Ex facie the fact that the plaintiff played soccer for
some two years after the episode of 3 July 1993 is a matter which could
give
rise to suspicion as to whether his present disability is in fact related to
his work injury of July 1993.
<P>

34   	While it is true that the plaintiff did not disclose the
full nature of his soccer playing activities to Dr Opie when he saw
him I
accept the plaintiff's explanation that as it was not directly raised he did
not mention it.
<P>

35   	I accept the plaintiff's evidence that he accepted advice
given to him by a Dr Hicks that the matter might resolve and advice
to him by a
physiotherapist that he should not keep himself in cotton wool. 
<P>

36   	In short, on balance, I am of the view that the
plaintiff's present disabilities are in fact related to his injury of 3 July
1993 and that he has done his best to persist with work and carry on as far as
he could, a normal life following the work incident
which included playing
soccer.
<P>

37   	In the absence of any evidence of any frank injury while
playing soccer I do not find that his soccer playing is causative
of his
present condition. I thus find that the plaintiff did suffer damage to his
adductor longus tendon on 3 July 1993 and as a
consequence of that injury has
missed time from work and also has not been able to work as much overtime as he
otherwise would have
due to his injury. Since 28 July 1999 the plaintiff's
condition is such that he is now fit only for sedentary employment.
<P>

38   	The plaintiff is now aged forty-one having been born on 1
August 1958.
<P>

39   	Prior to commencing employment with the defendant in June
1987 he had worked in a variety of occupations including work as
a spare parts
salesman, a crane driver and marking lines on roads and car parks. Accordingly,
the effects of his injury will therefore
cause him grave difficulties in
obtaining suitable work as he has no clerical experience.
<P>

40   	His sporting activities will be circumscribed as a
consequence of the injury - albeit it is doubtful that at the age of forty-one
his soccer playing would have continued in any event. He still is, as I would
understand his evidence, able to play the occasional
game of golf.
<P>

41   	Pursuant to s 79 of the New South Wales <b>Motor Accidents
Act</b> I am required to assess his damages for non-economic loss on the basis
of a percentage of the most extreme case. Having regard to
his age and the
continuing and indeed permanent effects as I would find them, of his injury, I
am of the view that I should assess
his damage for non-economic loss on the
basis of 35% of the most extreme case which quantifies at $95,550.
<P>

42   	Out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed in the sum of
$12,280.75 and I thus award him this amount.
<P>

43   	I turn then to the question of past economic loss. Two
employees of the defendant, namely Messrs Mullington and Cheetham were
advanced
as being comparable earners to the plaintiff. Taking the mean of their average
weekly earnings to 28 July 1999 as against
the earnings of the plaintiff, a
loss of $82,173 emerges for the period from 3 July 1993 to 28 July 1999, the
date when the plaintiff
ceased work.
<P>

44   	While, as I understand the matter, he is still technically
employed by the defendant there seems to be, on the evidence, no
prospect that
he will return to the defendant's employ because there are no duties of a
sedentary type available to him. I am of
the view that the plaintiff, having
regard to the extent of his injury, should be regarded as being totally
incapacitated from 28
July 1999 to the last day of the trial, namely 25 October
1999. That gives rise to a further loss of $14,508. Accordingly, adding
that
figure to the one previously mentioned, the sum of $96,681 emerges.
<P>

45   	I turn then to the question of future economic loss. The
plaintiff is now, as I have said, fit only for sedentary work. I
should add
that the plaintiff acknowledges that he has a capacity for work. As I
understand the parties, they have agreed that suitable
work in a sedentary
capacity would result in the plaintiff being able to earn, as an operator grade
2, the sum of $566 per week.
It seems to me that having regard to the mean
earnings of Cheetham and Mullington at $1,116 per week it is appropriate to
assess
the plaintiff as suffering from a present economic loss of $500 per
week. Using a multiplier 733.7 as being appropriate to his age
when utilising
the 5% tables it gives rise to a raw figure of $366,850. After deducting 15%
for vicissitudes a final figure of $311,822.50
emerges.
<P>

46   	I thus tabulate my findings as to damages as follows:
<P>

Out-of-pocket expenses	12,280.75
<P>

Past wage loss	96,681.00
<P>

Future economic loss	311,822.50
<P>

Damages for non-economic loss	<u>95,550.00</u>
<P>

	516,334.25
<P>

47   	I shall defer formally entering a judgment and the making
of any orders as to costs or interest (should such be allowable)
until after
the delivery of these reasons.
