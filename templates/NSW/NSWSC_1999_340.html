<b><u>4980/98 APPLICATION OF PJ v DIRECTOR GENERAL DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY
SERVICES.</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT:</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Mr and Mrs J seek a declaration pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 21</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/" class="autolink_findacts">Status
of Children Act 1996</a> (the Act) that they are respectively the father and the
mother of a child E, who was born on 18 December 1998.
<P>

2	That child was born as the result of a surrogacy arrangement under which it
was arranged that Mrs W, who is the mother of Mrs
J, would bear the child, Mrs
J being unable to do so, having not developed any uterus.
<P>

3	An ovum from Mrs J and fertilised by the sperm of Mr J was inserted in the
uterus of Mrs W and as a result of this having been
successful, the child was
born. This was done with the consent of Mr W, at least so far as the procedure
taking place was concerned.
<P>

4	It is important to understand that this court is not in any way expressing
any view on the desirability or otherwise of such procedures
taking place. When
I say that, it is for the purpose of that part of the proceedings which is the
subject of this judgment, it having
been agreed and ordered that the
alternative order namely an order for adoption, would be heard subsequently to
that part of the
proceedings which I am now determining.
<P>

5	Nor should it be thought that the court does not understand the distress
which has been caused to Mr and Mrs J by these proceedings,
and probably also
to the parents of Mrs J. Nevertheless, the matter must be determined in
accordance with the law and particularly
the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/" class="autolink_findacts">Status of
Children Act 1996</a>. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 14</a> of that Act is as follows: 
<P>

14.	Presumptions of parentage arising out of use of fertilisation procedures

<P>

(1)	When a married woman has undergone a fertilisation procedure as a result of
which she becomes pregnant: 
<P>

(a)	her husband is presumed to be the father of any child born as a result of
the pregnancy even if he did not provide any or all
of the sperm used in the
procedure, but only if he consented to the procedure, and 
<P>

(b)	the woman is presumed to be the mother of any child born as a result of the
pregnancy even if she did not provide the ovum used
in the procedure. 
<P>

(2)	If a woman (whether married or unmarried) becomes pregnant by means of a
fertilisation procedure using any sperm obtained from
a man who is not her
husband, that man is presumed not to be the father of any child born as a
result of the pregnancy. 
<P>

(3)	If a woman (whether married or unmarried) becomes pregnant by means of a
fertilisation procedure using an ovum obtained from
another woman, that other
woman is presumed not to be the mother of any child born as a result of the
pregnancy. 
<P>

(4)	Any presumption arising under subsections (1) --(3) is irrebuttable. 
<P>

(5)	In any proceedings in which the operation of subsection (1) is relevant, a
husband's consent to the carrying out of the fertilisation
procedure is
presumed. 
<P>

(6)	In this section: 
<P>

(a)	a reference to a married woman includes a reference to a woman who is
living with a man as his wife on a bona fide domestic
basis although not
married to him, and 
<P>

(b)	a reference (however expressed) to the husband or wife of a person: 
<P>

(i)	is, in a case where the person is living with another person of the
opposite sex as his or her spouse on a bona fide domestic
basis although not
married to the other person, a reference to that other person, and 
<P>

(ii)	does not, in that case, include a reference to the spouse (if any) to whom
the person is actually married.
<P>

6.	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 3</a> of that Act defines fertilisation procedure as being:
<P>

(a) 	the artificial insemination of a woman, 
<P>

(b) 	the procedure of transferring to a woman's body an ovum, (whether or not
produced by her) fertilised outside her body, or 
<P>

(c)...
<P>

7	The first question that arises, therefore, is whether or not the procedure
which took place here was a fertilisation procedure.
It was if it falls within
subsection (b) of the definition. The only basis on which it would not fall
within that definition is if
it could be said that what was transferred to the
body of Mrs W was not an ovum fertilised outside her body. The only basis on
which
it is argued that it was not such an ovum was that the proper description
of what was transferred to her uterus was that it was an
embryo.
<P>

8	According to the evidence of Dr Bowman which, apart from some small
variations, is the evidence which was given by Mrs J and Mrs
W, Mrs J
"underwent ovarian stimulation and had oocyte collected on 9 December 1997,
that these were fertilised with the sperm of
Mr J, and that six suitable
embryos resulted which were then cryo-preserved."  Then, following a quarantine
period, two embryos were
thawed and transferred to the uterus of Mrs W. One of
these developed and became the foetus and the child was subsequently born thus
in the words of Dr Bowman the child is genetically the child of Mr and Mrs
J.
<P>

9	I do not think that there is substance in the argument, based on some
uncertain distinction between an embryo and a fertilised
ovum, particularly in
view of the evidence in this case of the very short time between the
fertilisation and preservation. In my
view what happened was a fertilisation
procedure within the definition under the Act.
<P>

10	Once that conclusion is reached then the presumptions under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> follow
automatically as a matter of course. Mrs W, having undergone a fertilisation
procedure, is presumed to be the mother of the
child. As she underwent or
became pregnant by means of a fertilisation procedure, using the sperm obtained
from Mr. J who is not
her husband, then Mr. J is presumed not to be the father;
and as she became pregnant by means of a fertilisation procedure, using
ovum
obtained from another woman, namely her daughter, then her daughter is presumed
not to be the mother of the child.  Those presumptions
are irrebuttable.
<P>

11	In the same way the consent of Mr W to the carrying out of the procedure is
presumed, but that presumption is rebuttable, so
that if there is evidence on
the balance of probabilities that he did not so consent, then that presumption
is rebutted.
<P>

12	It is necessary to refer to two further matters. One is that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> of the Act
provides that a person is presumed to be a child's parent if that person's name
is entered as such parent in the births,
deaths and marriages register. Mr J is
registered as the father of E. Mrs W is registered as the mother. The
registration of Mrs
W as mother does conform with the presumption under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> of
the Act. The registration of Mr J as the father does not conform with the
irrebuttable presumption under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> of the Act. It follows from this that as
the presumption under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> is rebuttable and that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> is irrebuttable,
that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> must prevail.
<P>

13	The other argument which has been put forward by the solicitor for the
plaintiffs is that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12</a> of the Act provides that if a prescribed court has found
that a person is the child's parent there is an irrebuttable presumption
that
is so.  It was argued that this court could find that Mr and Mrs J are the
parents of E, and once that was done, they would
be presumed to be the child's
parents. In my view it would be impossible for this court on this application
to disregard <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14</a> and in accordance with such disregard make a declaration
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12.</a>  That latter section is intended for the protection of persons who
have been found to be parents by some other competent court, or
by this court
in other appropriate proceedings.  It is not intended to enable the
circumvention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14.</a>
<P>

14	I should add that a good deal of this is not really relevant to the
declarations which are sought in the further amended summons.
The court is not
being asked to declare who is the mother of the child or who is the father of
the child but is asked to declare
that particular persons are the mother and
father of the child; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soca1996199/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14</a> of the Act prevents such a declaration being made.
<P>

15	There are two further matters which have been put forward by Miss Harvey for
the plaintiffs. The first is that there is some
conflict with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60H</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act 1975</a> (Cth) and that it was intended, as can be seen from the
Parliamentary debates, that the State Legislation was to bring State Law
into
conformity with Commonwealth Law.  There does not appear to be any
inconsistency between s 14 of the Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60H</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>. It was
also submitted, although I do not think this was very strongly pressed, that
there might be some argument that the Act was
in contravention of the
International Convention of the Rights of the Child. It has not been shown how
there is such a breach, if
that were relevant, and I do not think that it is
possible to carry that argument any distance. 
<P>

16	The last matter which has been argued before me is the question of the
consent of Mr W and whether or not it amounts to a consent
under s 14(1) of the
Act. It is really purposeless to decide this because whether it was or was not,
Mr J would not be the father
of the child.  However, having said that, Mr W in
his second affidavit sworn 6 April 1999, said that he only consented to his
wife
bearing the child to enable his daughter and Mr J to have their own child
and under the belief that both would be recorded on the
birth certificate as
the parents, and he said in paragraph 9 of his earlier affidavit that he
consented to his wife entering the
IVF programme for that purpose and in that
belief.  It is probably best not to make any final determination on this
question, but
only to say that my preliminary view is that, having consented to
the actual procedure being carried out, then that consent was a
valid consent,
albeit that there might have been a mistaken belief as to one of the results of
that procedure going forward.
<P>

17	It follows from this that the plaintiff's claim under paragraphs 1 and 2 of
the further amended summons must be dismissed. 
<P>

18	The orders are: 
<P>

1.	The plaintiff's claim under paragraphs 1 and 2 of further amended summons be
dismissed. 
<P>

2.	No order as to costs. 
<P>

3.	I direct that the balance of the proceedings be heard by the Judge in charge
of the adoption list, namely Bryson J. 
<P>

4.	Liberty to approach the Associate of Bryson J for a directions hearing when
the evidence is complete.
