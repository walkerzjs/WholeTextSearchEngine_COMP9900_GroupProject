20231/96	<b>GARY HASTINGS   v   RANDOM HOUSE AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Following the jury's verdict on 11 February 1999, I directed the
entry of judgment for the defendant but reserved
the question of costs.  At
that time counsel for the defendant sought costs but this application was
opposed by counsel for the plaintiff
upon the basis that the defendant had only
on the day of the trial abandoned the defence of qualified privilege and the
defence arising
under s 13 of the <i>Defamation Act</i>.  I stood the matter
over to allow further argument and to afford the parties the opportunity to put
on any evidence concerning the
significance of the defences having been raised
and then abandoned.
<P>

2	The plaintiff, in opposing the order sought by the defendant, relied upon an
affidavit of his solicitor, Mr Phillips, which was
sworn on 15 February 1999.
The defendant relied upon an affidavit of its solicitor, Mr Potter, sworn on 18
February 1999.  Those
affidavits I have considered.
<P>

3	Both counsel have now made submissions based upon the evidence to be found in
the two affidavits to which I have referred.
<P>

4	For his part Mr Lynch submitted that the defence of qualified privilege ought
not to have been pleaded in the first instance and
his first submission was
that in consequence the plaintiff should not be ordered to pay any of the
defendant's costs.  However, I
do not accept that submission.  I do not
consider the Court would be justified in concluding that there was any lack of
responsibility
in pleading qualified privilege in this case nor in pleading the
defence under s 13 of the <i>Defamation Act</i>.
<P>

5	Ordinarily of course in litigation costs follow the event but it seems to me
that in this case an injustice would be done were
I to allow the defendant to
recover all its costs.  A defendant must appreciate that when a defence is
pleaded the pleading raises
an issue which both sides must address.  Here the
issue of qualified privilege was a very significant issue and Mr Phillips in
his
affidavit of 15 February 1999 has identified the sort of preparations which
the pleading of this defence called for by the plaintiff.
 No doubt the same
sort of considerations arose for the defendant in preparing to support the
defence.
<P>

6	The defence under s 13 of the <i>Defamation Act</i> to the effect that the
matter complained of was published under such circumstances that the plaintiff
was unlikely to suffer harm
would not have led, in the circumstances of this
case, to any significant costs being incurred in addressing it.  Indeed, as Mr
Blackburn
acknowledged, if the jury had concluded that the imputations were
conveyed and the plaintiff was identified, the defence could not
have been
sustained, because these imputations were grave.
<P>

7	As the trial proceeded the central issue was whether or not the matter
complained of identified the plaintiff.  On that issue
the plaintiff failed and
the defendant succeeded, so that it seems to me it is appropriate that the
defendant should recover its
reasonable costs of the trial itself.
<P>

8	The costs related to the issues raised by the abandoned defences are another
matter.  In my opinion it would be unjust to the
plaintiff if the costs order
made by the Court did not take into account that costs were incurred by the
plaintiff in preparing to
meet the abandoned defences and that costs were
doubtless incurred by the defendant in seeking to prove the defence of
qualified
privilege.
<P>

9	Having reflected on the evidence contained in the affidavits and the
submissions of counsel, I have concluded that justice requires
a special order
to limit the costs recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff concerning
costs preliminary to the hearing which
began on 9 February 1999.  I propose to
order that the plaintiff pay only one half of such costs.
<P>

10	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs incurred in relation to
the hearing of this cause from 9-11 February 1999,
and one half of such costs
as were earlier incurred, with all such costs to be paid on a party and party
basis.
