<b>1516/99 MAURIZIO GERACE  v  ART COATING PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b> <b>	</b>This is the hearing of the proceedings in
which the plaintiff seeks specific performance of an agreement to commute
rights under the
<b>Workers Compensation Act.  </b>A Judge of the Court has
made an order that the whole of the proceedings be heard by a Master.
<P>

2  	A resolution of the issues in the case will require some
consideration of the terms of the Workers' Compensation legislation
and the way
it has changed during the history of the factual background with which I am
concerned.  In summary the defendants resist
the application on two grounds.
The first is that it was a condition precedent to any liability under the
agreement that the plaintiff
obtain the approval of Workcover to the proposed
agreement to compromise the claim by commuting the plaintiffs rights.  The
second
ground is that the defendant suggests, when looking at the parties'
actions objectively since March 1998, they have abandoned the
agreement to
compromise.
<P>

3  	In late 1989 and early 1990 the plaintiff was exposed to some
Epoxy resin paints while employed as an industrial painter with
the defendant.
He has not returned to work since that exposure.  On 30 July 1992 he was
awarded $200 per week compensation payments
from 19 February 199 1. On 7
November the plaintiff was awarded the maximum rate of compensation by an award
made by His Honour Judge
Campbell the Chief Judge of the Compensation Court on
7 November 1996.  By the this time, apart from suffering from dermatitis the
plaintiff was suffering from some psychiatric problems as a result of the
injuries which he had received.
<P>

4  	On 4 September 1997 there was before the Court a Notice of Motion
brought by the plaintiff, the applicant in those proceedings,
pursuant to s
53(1) of the <b>Workers Compensation Act </b>1987.  That section was one which
allowed the Court to determine that the incapacity is likely to be of a
permanent nature and that
the payments could be transported to Italy to which
the plaintiff then wished to return.  On that day the agreement in question was
entered into and the Court stood the motion over pending a commutation
application and gave the parties liberty to apply.  The document
is described
as 'Heads of Agreement' and provides as follows:-
<P>

"The applicant agrees to settle all entitlements to compensation and damages
against the Respondent for a total of $130,000.
<P>

Settlement is to be effected as follows:
<P>

1.	By way of Commutation which is:
<P>

(a)	to include all/any liability to pay compensation including weekly payments,
non-economic loss, Section 60 expenses and interest;
<P>

(b)	to Include nature and conditions of employment, together with any injuries
sustained in the course of or arising out of the
Applicant's employment with
the Respondent, and to cover the whole body and any psychiatric injury or
condition and industrial deafness;
<P>

(c) to be effective from the date of employment and include a Common Law
release.
<P>

2.    Applicant is to make expeditious application for Commutation and to use
best endeavours to secure approval.
<P>

......
<P>

5. Other matters.
<P>

Costs in relation to Notice of Motion listed for hearing 4/9/97 reserved.
<P>

7. In the event that the Commutation is not approved, matter to be listed for
hearing.
<P>

Dated: 9/9/97."
<P>

5  	It can be seen that paragraph 2 requires the applicant, the
plaintiff in this matter, to secure approval.  At that stage the
legislation
required that any such commutation would have to be approved <b>by </b>the
Workcover Authority of New South Wales before being dealt with by the court.
Accordingly, on 13 November 1997 an application <b>for</b> commutation was sent
by the plaintiffs solicitor to Workcover.  On 12 December 1997 they received a
letter dated 9 December 1997
from Workcover in which that body advised that the
application could not be considered in its current form.  They enclosed a set
<b>of </b>guidelines and indicated that the application needed to be submitted
by the insurer of the employer.
<P>

6  	Thereafter on 26 March 1998 the plaintiffs solicitors sent a
letter to the insurer's solicitors providing information in accordance
with the
direction of Workcover.  The solicitor asked to be advised when the documents
could be uplifted so that he could deliver
them to Workcover.  The response was
a letter on 14 April 1998 indicating that the insurer confirmed that there was
consent to commute
the claim in the sum of $130,000.
<P>

7  	The proceedings were relisted before His Honour Judge Campbell on
3 April 1998.  During that hearing the solicitor for the insurer
indicated that
the commutation application had been prepared, submitted to Workcover and was
awaiting approval.  On that ground she
sought to oppose the application for the
order under s 53.  Counsel for the applicant indicated to His Honour that those
applications
could take up to two years to be dealt with by Workcover so in the
meantime his client wished to proceed.  The matter was stood down
for a while
in order to allow the parties to try and ascertain the progress of the
application to Workcover but that was not successful.
 Ultimately in the end
His Honour made an order under s 53(1) that the applicant's incapacity for work
resulting from the injury
was likely to be of a permanent nature.  This allowed
the applicant, if he wished, to return to Italy and still receive his
payments.
<P>

8  	By a letter of 30 July 1998 the insurer's solicitors wrote to the
applicant's solicitors and referred to the coming into force
of amendments to
the Workcover legislation, particularly s 5 1, and asked whether both parties
should refrain from sending the application
for commutation to the Workcover
authority for their further consideration and probable rejection.  It is to be
noted that the amendments
removed the requirement from s 51 of having to obtain
the approval of Workcover and substituted a different provision which required
the Compensation Court to give approval.  One thing that is apparent from this
letter is that the amended application which had been
prepared quite some time
ago by the applicants and which was forwarded to the insurer's solicitors had
not been lodged with Workcover.
 This was later confirmed by Workcover and from
documents tendered on the hearing before me.  It is also quite contrary to what
the
Court was told in April 1998.
<P>

9  	On 12 October 1998 there was a further letter from the
applicant's solicitors to the insurer's solicitors in which the plaintiffs
solicitors advised that the plaintiff was making arrangements to return to
Italy permanently.  He then went on to say:-
<P>

"We are instructed that our client is prepared to accept the sum of $160,000.00
in full and final settlement of his Workers' Compensation
rights on the basis
that the settlement is approved <u>immediately __His</u> Honour Judge Campbell
the Chief Judge of the Compensation Court of New South Wales pursuant to the
exit provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act 1987</a> (as amended)."
<P>

10  	The response from the insurer's solicitors was to say that the
matter had been forwarded to the insurers for consideration.
<P>

11  	On 19 November 1998 the applicant's solicitors filed an
application for determination in the Commission seeking a commutation.
 The
amount for which the commutation was sought was $130,000.  In other words it
clearly was seeking approval of the original agreement
no doubt because there
had been no response to the suggestion in the letter of 12 October 1998.  That
then led to discussions in
which the insurers indicated that they did not
consider that the agreement of September 1997 was still on foot.
<P>

12  	The application came on for hearing on 10 December 1998.  There
was discussion about a decision about to be handed down by
Commissioner Burke
in the matter of <b>Tran v JR Manufacturing</b> <b>Industries Pty Ltd </b>and
His Honour Judge Hughes struck out the matter.  On the following day there was
again an appearance and His Honour at the request
of counsel vacated his order
of 10 December 1998 and allowed the matter to remain in the list so that there
could be an argument
in due course as to whether the worker was entitled to
bring the application for commutation.  The matter was stood to the bottom
of
the pending list and in fact it will come on for hearing before the Commission
during August this year.
<P>

13  	It seems reasonably clear that any application to a court to
enforce the agreement which the parties have reached is one which
depends upon
the general law of contract.  In that circumstance it is appropriate that the
application be in this court rather than
the Workers Compensation Court.  This
is because a suit for specific performance of an agreement is not 'a matter
arising under this
Act' as that expression is used in s 105 of the <b>Workplace
Injury Management</b> <b>and Workers Compensation Act </b>1998.  See the
decision of Waddell J in <b>West v Barker &amp; Ors </b>unreported 27 February
1981 dealing with the predecessor of s 51 on this aspect and the carefully
reasoned judgment of Judge Burke
in <b>Tran v JR Manufacturing Industries</b>
<b>Pty Ltd 10 </b>November 1998.
<P>

14  	It is necessary to turn to the form of the legislation both
before and after 1 August 1998 to consider the actual situation
of the
application such as the one which was the subject of the agreement between the
parties.
<P>

15  	The relevant parts of s 51 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act</a>
</b>1987 which were in force at the time the agreement was made are in the
following form: -
<P>

<b>"Commutation in certain cases of weekly payments.</b>
<P>

51. This section applies:
<P>

......
<P>

(c)	To a liability to make a weekly payment to a particular workers (and to the
extent) approved by the Authority in special circumstances
such as the
following:
<P>

(i) the worker requires a lump sum to establish an income-producing
business;
<P>

(ii)	the worker requires a lump sum to enable the worker to move from the area
in which he or she lives and there are substantial
economic or compassionate
grounds for doing so;
<P>

(iii)	the lump sum would otherwise be likely to assist substantially in the
rehabilitation of the worker because of the special
circumstances of the
case.
<P>

(2)	A liability in respect of any weekly payment of compensation to which this
section applies may, with the consent of the worker,
be commuted (either in
whole or in part) to a lump sum, determined by the Compensation Court, having
regard to:
<P>

(a) any dispute as to liability to pay compensation under this Act;
<P>

(b) the injury, the age of the worker, and the occupation of the worker at the
time of the occurrence of the injury; and
<P>

(c) the worker's diminished ability to compete in an open labour market.
<P>

(3) If -
<P>

(a)	the Compensation Court determines any such lump sum;
<P>

(b)	the worker agrees that payment of the lump sum should remove any liability
to make a payment under Division 3 or 4 in respect
of the injury; and
<P>

(c) the terms of any relevant regulations or approval of the Authority under
subsection (1) have been complied with,
<P>

payment of the lump sum removes any liability to which the agreement of the
worker relates.
<P>

(5)	An agreement as to the commutation of a payment to a lump sum shall not,
nor shall the payment of the sum payable under the
agreement, exempt the person
by whom the payment is payable from any liability under this Act unless the sum
has been determined
by the Compensation Court in accordance with this Act.
<P>

.............................
<P>

(9)	Payment of a lump sum to which liability in respect of any weekly payment
of compensation has been wholly or partially commuted
under this section or
redeemed under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15</a> of the former Act (as applied by Schedule 6 to this
Act) is taken for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 15</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s22a.html" class="autolink_findacts">22A</a>, 122, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151z.html" class="autolink_findacts">151Z</a> and 273 of
this Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64</a> of the former Act (as so applied) to be payment of the
compensation concerned in pursuance of the liability to pay the compensation
concerned.'
<P>

16  	It can be seen that the liability to make a weekly payment which
applies in this and in the majority of cases require approval
by the authority.
Sub-section 2 is the section providing for commutation and the Compensation
Court determines the lump sum no doubt
at the parties request by a
consideration of what the parties agree should be the appropriate amount.
<P>

17  	Effective 1 August 1998 the section was changed and the relevant
sections are as follows:-
<P>

<b>"51 Exit payments by commutation in certain cases of weekly payments.</b>
<P>

(1)	(Repealed)
<P>

(2)	A liability in respect of any weekly payment of compensation may, with the
consent of the worker, be commuted (either in whole
or in part) to a lump sum,
determined by the Compensation Court, having regard to -
<P>

(a) any dispute as to liability to pay compensation under this Act;
<P>

(b)	the injury, the age of the worker, the general health of the worker, and
the occupation of the worker at the time of the occurrence
of the injury;
<P>

(c) the worker's diminished ability to compete in an open labour market; and
<P>

(d) other benefits that the worker may be entitled to from any other source.
<P>

(2A) The Compensation Court is not to determine a lump sum for the purposes of
this section unless satisfied that:
<P>

(a)  the termination of liability concerned is in the best interests of the
worker, and
<P>

(b)	the worker fully understands the effect of the termination of liability
concerned and has received adequate advice as to the
consequences of the
termination.
<P>

............................
<P>

(3) If -
<P>

(a) the Compensation Court determines any such lump sum, and
<P>

(b)	the worker agrees that payment of the lump sum should remove any liability
to make a payment under Division 3 or 4 in respect
of the injury,
<P>

payment of the lump sum removes any liability to which the agreement of the
worker relates.
<P>

(4)	(Repealed)
<P>

(5)	An agreement as to the commutation of a payment to a lump sum shall not,
nor shall the payment of the sum payable under the
agreement, exempt the person
by whom the payment is payable from any liability under this Act unless the sum
has been determined
by the Compensation Court in accordance with this Act.
<P>

.............................
<P>

(9)	Payment of a lump sum to which liability in respect of any weekly payment
of compensation has been wholly or partially commuted
under this section or
redeemed under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 15</a> of the former Act (as applied by Schedule 6 to this
Act) is taken for the purposes of this Act, the 1998 Act and the former Act (as
applied by this Act) to be payment of the compensation concerned in pursuance
of the liability to pay the compensation concerned."
<P>

18  	Immediately apparent is a substantive change in the form of the
section.  The requirement for the consent of the authority
(which is Workcover
Authority of New South Wales) is no longer required and instead the functions
which that Authority used to perform
are dealt with by the Compensation Court
under s 51(2A).
<P>

19  	It is necessary to have regard to the terms of the agreement
which I have referred to in paragraph 4 bearing in mind the then
existing
statutory framework.  The application for commutation and approval referred to
in paragraphs 2 and 7 of that agreement clearly
contemplate the approval of the
authority which was necessary under s 51 in its then form.  The reference to
approval in clause 2
would not encompass the determination of the lump sum by
the Commission.  However a term would normally be implied that the parties
do
all things necessary to obtain such determination.  The approval of Workcover
has not been obtained and given the passage of time
it seems unlikely that the
authority could or would grant such approval given that it now has no statutory
mandate to do so.
<P>

20  	The question that arises as a preliminary matter is the effect
of the non-granting of approval given the change in the legislation.
 It would
seem clear that the condition requiring approval of the authority is a
condition subsequent.  The plaintiffs submissions
were to the effect that the
matter has to be looked at at the time of decree, that one sees that no
approval is required and therefore
one can disregard the condition.  The
defendant maintains to the contrary submitting that as no approval has been
obtained the condition
has not been satisfied and that the agreement is at an
end.
<P>

21  	There is also the question of whether the failure to satisfy the
condition subsequent automatically leads to a termination
of the contract or
whether it merely gives a right to a party not in default to terminate the
contract.  This has been a matter of
some debate in the authorities.
<P>

22  	In <b>Gange v. Sulllivan </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20116%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 116 CLR 418</a>, a contract for
sale contained a provision that the contract was made subject to the purchaser
obtaining a certain development approval
of the local council and that in the
event of the council not granting such approval by 31 May 1965 the contract was
to be at an
end.  By 31 May 1965 the council's approval had not been given and
the purchaser had not waived the condition.  It was held that
the contract did
not automatically come to an end.  Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ. said at p 44
1:
<P>

"Whilst the effect of a condition must in every case depend upon the language
in which it is expressed and a decision upon the meaning
of one condition
cannot determine the meaning of a different condition, the authorities cited do
show a disposition on the part of
the courts to treat non-fulfilment of a
condition such as that here under consideration as rendering a contract
voidable rather than
void in order to forestall a party to a contract from
gaining some advantage from his own conduct in securing, or contributing to,
the non-fulfilment of a condition bringing the contract to an end.  Accordingly
we are prepared to treat non-fulfilment of the condition
as rendering the
contract voidable rather than void."
<P>

23  	This statement of the normal inference to be drawn in such
circumstances was cited with approval in <b>Perri v Coolangatta</b>
<b>Investments Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20537" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 537</a> at 544-545 per Gibbs CJ and at
567 per Brennan J.
<P>

24  	As explained in <b>The Law of Contract </b>by Greig &amp; Davis
at p 592, a degree of difficulty arises in this respect out of some of the
language used in <b>Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1950/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2081%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 81 CLR 418.</a>  The sale
of a pastoral property was to take place under the terms of a contract
containing a cl. 12 which stated that 'in the event
of the consent of the
Treasurer not being obtained within two months from the date hereof or within
such further period as may be
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto, this
contract shall be deemed to be cancelled'.  The court expressed the view that
this
clause was 'on its true construction .... not a condition precedent but a
condition subsequent' (at 443).  However, the members of
the court (Latham CJ,
Williams and Fullagar JJ) must have been using the expression in a somewhat
broader sense as meaning not a
condition that automatically terminates the
contract (the normal sense of the expression, certainly in the context of an
interest
in property created, for example, by a will), but as referring to a
term which entitled a party to terminate if that party so wished.
 This
interpretation is necessary to harmonise with the court's earlier finding that,
notwithstanding the apparently clear words
in the contract itself, the failure
of the condition rendered the contract voidable and not void.  The court relied
upon a pronouncement
by Lord Atkinson in <b>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v</b>
<b>Societe des Ateliers et Chantiers de France </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281919%29%20AC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1919) AC 1</a> at 9.
<P>

25  	The court referred to the circumstance in that case where the
condition was one that might not be fulfilled without fault on
either side and
said that the position was 'not quite so clear'.  Here again Lord Atkinson
applied, and the provision 'construed
as making the contract not void but
voidable' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1950/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1950] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281950%29%2081%20CLR%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1950) 81 CLR 418</a> at 441).  The question of who might avoid the
contract would then depend upon the circumstances.  If fault on one side were
involved,
then the situation would be as outlined above.  If, however, 'the
event has happened without default on' either side, then either
party may avoid
the contract.  But neither need do so'.
<P>

26  	The proposition in <b>Gange v Sullivan </b>seems to have been
accepted by Kearney J in <b>Almond v Camrol Pty Ltd </b>(1984) 3 BPR 9461 at
9466 and Bryson J in <b>Childs Pty Ltd v Rumboll </b>(1990) NSW Conv.  R. 55510

27  	There are two cases which deal with the situation where a
contract provided for the obtaining of consent which was not necessary
or where
the requirement for consent was removed during the course of the contract.  The
first of these is <b>Reid v Bennett, McKinley Third</b> <b>Party </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1955/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] VicLawRp 79</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%20VLR%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) VLR
505.</a>  The contract was expressed to be 'subject to the consent of the Minister
of Lands under the Soldier Settlement Commission Act of
Victoria.  Given that
the purchaser in this case was a discharged soldier consent was not required.
The court interpreted the condition
as requiring the Minister's consent only if
it should be legally necessary under the <b>Soldiers Settlement Act.
</b>Having construed it in that way Scholl J held that the condition had thus
no effect on the operation of the contract.
<P>

28  	More difficult however is the High Court decision in <b>Besier v
Poster</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1952/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1952] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%2094%20CLR%20526" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 94 CLR 526.</a>  This decision was given after <b>Suttor v
Gundowda</b> <b>Pty Ltd </b>and before <b>Gange v SuUivan.  </b>The contract
which was made on 9 August 1948 in this case provided for the sale of land in
Tasmania and that the purchase price should
be as follows:-
<P>

"For the purchase of the land the sum of 26,500 pounds or such sum as may be
approved by the delegate of the Treasurer under the
National Security (Economic
Organisation) Regulations, which ever is the lesser."
<P>

29  	On 20 September 1948 land sales in Tasmania ceased to be
controlled by Commonwealth regulations.  On the same day the Tasmanian
Act
controlling land sales came into operation.  Ultimately an approval was given
at a reduced price by the State authority but none
was ever given by the
Federal authority . The court held that the action for specific performance
failed upon the ground that no
consent was given to the contract for the higher
sum of 26,500 pounds and the condition on which sale at the lower sum depended
was
never fulfilled in that the clause specified consent by the Federal
authority and not by the State authority.  The court in this
case clearly
treated the condition as one in which non-fulfilment terminated the contract,
i.e. rendered it void rather than voidable.
 The court at 529 expressed itself
in these terms:-
<P>

"What we shall place our decision upon is the plain meaning of the provision
which we have read from the contract, the provision
which states that the price
may be a lower sum approved by the delegate of the Treasurer under the National
Security (Economic Organization)
Regulations.  No consent was given to the
contract for the higher sum of 26,500 pounds and any approval or consent which
was obtained
capable of satisfying the terms of the provision was given only by
the State authority.  It is clear that the clause specifies the
federal
authority, the delegate of the Treasurer under the National Security (Economic
Organization) Regulations, and we think that
the plaintiff cannot escape the
consequences of the fact that the condition which those words prescribe was
never fulfilled, with
the result that the condition on which the obligation of
the contract as a sale at a lower price depends was never fulfilled.  To
escape
from that it has been argued that the words "the delegate of the Treasurer" in
the National Security (Economic Organization)
Regulations, whilst literally
referring to the federal authority, are really directed at specifying what may
be called the legal
authority for the time being who may exercise land sales
control on the same principles as appear from the Economic Organization
Regulations.  The argument is that there is nothing except the legal position
of the delegate of the Treasurer under the National
Security (Economic
Organization) Regulations to lead to the selection of him as the person to fix
the lower price and that in reality
and in substance those words are merely
directed to prescribe the legal authority as he may be from time to time
constituted provided
that the principles upon which the authority proceeds are
the same or substantially the same as those which the National Security
(Economic Organization) Regulations contemplated.  Accordingly, they should, as
it is submitted for the plaintiff, be construed as
in substance providing for
the possibility of the transfer of authority from Commonwealth to State.
<P>

We think that there cannot be found in the words any such wide intention.  They
speak for themselves.  They are definite and they
satisfy the authority which
is erected by the Commonwealth."
<P>

30  	The court also considered a submission that the implication from
the circumstances was that in the context of the transfer
of land sales control
from Federal to State governments contracts should proceed under the new
authority.  The court refused to do
this.
<P>

31  	This is a very clear authority on legislation similar to the
present situation.  The legislation changed to remove the requirement
for
consent by the national authority and the legislation in the present case has
changed by removing the requirement for the approval
of Workcover.  If it was
not obtained one would have thought that the same result might follow.  The
difference between this case
and the matter before me is that the provision in
the former fixed the actual price and was a necessary event before the matter
could
be completed. The present matteris a condition requiring approval, the
requirement for which has disappeared with the change of legislation.
<P>

32  	Given the course of authority in the High Court and the approval
of the principles in <b>Gange v Sullivan </b>in <b>Perri's case </b>it seems to
me that the condition should only be construed as voidable at the option of the
party not in default.
<P>

33  	The failure of the defendant to forward the application to
Workcover meant that the defendant was certainly in default in respect
of what
would be its implied obligation to do all things reasonably necessary on its
part to enable the plaintiff to obtain consent.
 It could thus not rely on the
non-fulfilment of the condition to avoid the contract at least up to 30 July
1998 and perhaps later.
 In any event it did not attempt to avoid the contract
until late 1998 after the requirement for consent was removed.
<P>

34  	The present situation is more like the position in <b>Reid v
Bennett </b>to which I have referred.  It seems to me that consent ceases to be
a requirement because of the change in legislation and there is
nothing upon
which clause 2 can operate provided that the contract had not been abandoned by
the parties prior to 1 August 1998.
<P>

35  	It is necessary to turn to the question of whether the parties
have abandoned the agreement.  It is apparent that the agreement
was reached at
the time there was before the court a Notice of Motion for an order pursuant to
s 53(1) of the Act to determine that
the applicant's incapacity to work
resulting from the injury is likely to be of a permanent nature.  Section 53 is
in the following
terms:-"
<P>

53 Weekly payments residence outside Commonwealth (cf former s 54)
<P>

(1)	If a worker receiving, or entitled to receive, a weekly payment of
compensation under an award ceases to reside in Australia,
the worker shall
thereupon cease to be entitled to receive any weekly payment, unless a medical
referee or medical panel certifies,
or the Compensation Court determines, that
the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is likely to be of a
permanent nature.
<P>

(2)	If the incapacity is so certified or determined to be of a permanent
nature, the worker is entitled to receive quarterly the
amount of the weekly
payments accruing due during the preceding quarter, so long as the worker
establishes, in such manner and at
such intervals as the Authority may require,
the worker's identity and the continuance of the incapacity in respect of which
the
weekly payment is payable."
<P>

36  	On the making of the agreement that application was stood over
pending the approval of Workcover to the commutation.  The next
event which
happened was the restoration of the motion for hearing, presumably by the
plaintiff, which came on for hearing on 3 April1998.
 The defendant opposed the
application being dealt with because the commutation application had still not
been dealt with by Workcover.
In other words it was taking the position that
that agreement was still in existence.  The plaintiff' case as put to the
Commission
on	that day apparently was to give the plaintiff an option of
returning to Italy as well as having the commutation in due course
approved.
It was necessary for the applicant to have the application approved if he was
to return to Italy because otherwise he could
not continue to receive the full
compensation payments which he was then presently receiving.  However, perusal
of the transcript
does indicate that the plaintiff wished, in due course, if he
obtained the consent of Workcover, to proceed with the application
for
computation.  There is some inconsistency here in the sense that I would have
thought that an application under s 53 which was
successful would have removed
one of the aspects of liability which would be necessary to be considered on
the approval of the application
for computation.
<P>

37  	The next thing that seems to have happened is the letter of 30
July from the defendant's solicitors to the plaintiffs solicitors
asking if the
application for approval should still be sent.  There is nothing in that which
would indicate an abandonment by either
party.
<P>

38  	As time passed and the plaintiff continued to receive his
payments the next matter of importance on this aspect is the letter
of 12
October 1998 the full details of which are:-
<P>

"We refer to previous correspondence in this matter and to our telephone
discussion today with Mr Peter McCarthy.
<P>

We advise that our client is presently making arrangements to return to Italy
to live permanently. 
<P>

We are instructed that our client and his wife are concerned about the cost of
future treatment in relation to his psychiatric condition
and his contact
dermatitis.  There is also concern that our client will not find any suitable
work in Italy because of his medical
condition.
<P>

Further as the agreement to accept $130,000 as a commutation settlement
occurred in 1997 and our client was willing to accept that
sum in that time if
the Workcover Authority approved the settlement, we are instructed to seek your
client's consent to the settlement
sum of $130,000 being reviewed and increased
to the sum of $160,000.
<P>

We are instructed that our client is prepared to accept the sum of $160,000 in
full and final settlement of his Workers' Compensation
rights on the basis that
the settlement is approved <u>immediately</u> by His Honour Judge Campbell the
Chief Judge of the Compensation Court of New South Wales pursuant to the exit
provisions of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act 1987</a> (as amended).
<P>

We await your advices."
<P>

39  	The critical words in that letter are:-
<P>

"We are instructed to seek your client's consent to the settlement sum of
$130,000 being reviewed and increased to the sum of $160,000."
<P>

40  	This language is not consistent with a denial of the existing
agreement and importantly seeks a review from other side.
<P>

41  	The second last paragraph of the letter goes on to indicate that
the plaintiff was prepared to accept that increase provided
that it was
approved immediately by the Chief Judge.  The letter was silent on whether, if
$160,000 was not agreed, the plaintiff
would not accept $130,000.
<P>

42  	Although the matter is not without difficulty it seems to me
that the plaintiff has not abandoned the earlier agreement by
making the
request for review.  After all, one of the factors that obviously is apparent
from the letter is the fact that time has
passed and circumstances have
changed.
<P>

43  	All that happened after this correspondence was the defendant
taking the position that they were not bound by the earlier agreement
due to
the absence of consent from Workcover and the plaintiff taking the position
that he was and seeking to enforce the same. 
In the circumstances 1 could not
conclude that there had been an abandonment of the contract by both parties.
<P>

44  	I turn to what was said to be a discretionary aspects in the
matter by the defendant.  One of these was a reference to <b>Gosper v
Christopherson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%2d86%29%20160%20CLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985-86) 160 CLR 243</a> where the High Court held that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15(1)</a>
did	not authorise the Commission to order redemption so as to force an
unwilling employer to redeem.  In <b>Tran v JR</b> <b>Manufacturing Industries
Pty Ltd </b>Judge Burke has suggested that the situation may be different under
the present s 51 of the Act.  Whether that is so probably is not
important as
the obligation on the defendant to make the payment will arise from his
agreement to do so by force of the agreement
entered into in September 1997.
<P>

45  	It would seem to me that there is no lack of mutuality and any
delay that has occurred has substantially been a result of the
respondents
failing to process the application for commutation.  In any event it seems to
be a process that would take some years
to complete.
<P>

46  	Another matter which was raised was the question of whether or
not the present application before the Workers Compensation
which has been
brought by the plaintiff is an appropriate one.  In <b>Tran v JR</b>
<b>Manufacturing Industries Pty Ltd </b>Judge Burke left this matter open
suggesting that there might be some argument that the application still has to
be brought by the
employer.  However, in the present case on the form of the
legislation both before and after 1 August 1998 it would be appropriate
to
imply a condition that each party would do all things necessary to make
application to the court for the court to determine the
lump sum.  Both forms
of section required application to the court for an order determining the lump
sum.
<P>

47  	In these circumstances it seems to me that the agreement ought
to be specifically performed.  Accordingly, 1 propose to order
that the
agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant of 3 September 1997 be
carried into execution and that:-
<P>

1.	The defendant do whatever may be reasonably required of him on the part of
the plaintiff to seek the commutation to a lump sum
of the defendant's
liability by the Compensation Court in the sum of $130,000.
<P>

2.	That in the event that the Compensation Court commutes the liability in a
lump sum of $130,000 that the defendant pay such sum
to the plaintiff less any
lawful deductions.
<P>

I will hear any submissions on the precise form of the orders and costs.
<P>

I publish my reasons.
