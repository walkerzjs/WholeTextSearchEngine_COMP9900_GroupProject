<P>

<b>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	In these contempt proceedings I made a finding on 17 May 1999 that the
contemnor, Leith Gordon Bagshaw was guilty of contempt.
 On Monday I had had
submissions from the parties as to the manner in which the court should deal
with the contemnor.
<P>

2	The court is in the difficulty that the contemnor is an undischarged bankrupt
who, although having initiated proceedings to set
aside that discharge and
having threatened those proceedings for sometime, still remains an undischarged
bankrupt.  He has given
evidence before me that he is in a position to obtain
some funds for the purpose of complying with any financial order which the
court may make.
<P>

3	This is a matter where I have found the contempt to be wilful but have taken
into account that the contemnor did not understand
the serious consequences of
failing to comply with this court's orders, notwithstanding that he was quite
well aware of what he was
doing.
<P>

4	 This would in the normal course be a matter for the imposition of a fine of
some considerable magnitude, but the court ought
not make orders which are not
likely to be complied with and are effectively impractical.
<P>

5	I have indicated to the parties that it is appropriate that a costs order be
made and the size of that order will of itself in
the nature of the
circumstances of the contemnor be a very substantial penalty.
<P>

6	I have indicated that notwithstanding that I do not think the imposition of a
fine in the circumstances is appropriate.
<P>

7	I have been addressed on this matter by both counsel.  I nonetheless think
that the contempt needs to be purged.  I therefore
propose in making an order
as to costs of the proceedings to make an order restricting the contemnor from
further proceeding with
the defences upon which he relies and the cross action
in the proceedings until the costs order is paid and the contempt is thereby
purged.  This of course does not preclude the other defendant from continuing
with the defences which she has relied on.
<P>

8	I turn then to the difficult question of quantum in terms of an order for
costs.  It seems to me that the court with some reluctance
taking on the role
of a taxing officer should assess an amount of the costs.  There is no question
in my mind that a costs order
should be made.  Costs incurred for legal
expenses may well be recoverable in any event as a debt due under the
mortgage.
<P>

9	The premises the subject of the mortgage are still occupied by the contemnor
and his wife and the value of that property is considerably
less than the
amount owing under the  mortgage, that debt now being calculated in excess of a
million dollars.
<P>

10	I have had admitted in evidence accounts from not only the solicitors but
counsel appearing in the proceedings.  The court is
placed in an awkward
position in dealing with these matters, particularly where the court is faced
with hourly charging rates which
of themselves are indeed quite proper and
indeed modest, but where the court is unable to assess the reasonableness of
the amount
of time spent.
<P>

11	Exhibit F sets out an indication by calculation of certain times spent.  The
problem arises that litigants waiting around outside
the court have fees being
incurred at an hourly rate which very quickly builds up to a very substantial
sum.
<P>

12	In terms of counsel's fees there is no question that this is a very
difficult matter and the extent and quality of the submissions
written and
otherwise on the part of the counsel for the plaintiff have been well and ably
prepared and that there is obviously a
large amount of time being spent.
However, to look at one item on 17 September 1998, reviewing affidavits filed
by the defendants
to determine whether any further subpoenas should be served,
four and a half hours and advice as to further evidence, which is another
two
and a half hours, seven hours on a matter such as this is clearly inappropriate
and, one would have thought, a matter that could
have been dealt with in an
hour at the maximum.
<P>

13	I do not in making this order intend to reflect on the worth of counsel or
solicitors for the time spent, and certainly not on
the quality of the work,
but I am merely reflecting the inability of the court in making an order to
make a proper assessment of
the time taken.
<P>

14	I order that the contemnor pay the costs of this motion and in that I
confirm and include the order made by me on Wednesday,
the 12th last as to
costs awarded on 12 May 1999.
<P>

15	I assess costs including disbursements at $20,000.
<P>

16	In relation to the contempt itself I do not propose, as I have indicated, to
fine or imprison the contemnor. However, I consider
it appropriate that an
order be made that the contemnor purge his contempt by an order that he be
precluded from relying on the defence
or any pleading filed on his behalf,
including the cross action, until his contempt shall have been purged by the
payment of costs.
<P>

17	I therefore order that the contempt herein of Leith Gordon Bagshaw, for that
contempt, the contemnor is admonished by the court
for the very serious action
which he took for contacting witnesses knowing very well that the effect
therein would be to inhibit
those witnesses in carrying out their duties as
officers of a bank or as witnesses in the proceedings.  That contempt will be
purged
by the payment in full of the order for costs that has been made.  The
contemnor having indicated that he is able to obtain some
funds to make that
payment I take that into account, but in any event order that the costs be paid
within three months from today.
<P>

18	I do not propose to restrain the plaintiff herein from proceeding by way of
formal order, but I indicate in the circumstances
that the court would consider
it inappropriate  for the plaintiff to take further proceedings in the court
during that period of
three months, except of course as may be necessary in
respect of any action to protect the security of the mortgage or in respect
of
any action which may be initiated by the contemnor.
<P>

19	I note that the order which I have made precluding the contemnor from taking
any further part in relation to the pleadings filed
does not of course preclude
him from making application to this court in respect of any issue that may
arise incidental to and in
relation to these proceedings for contempt.
<P>

	
<P>

	
<P>

20	The formal orders that I make are as follows: 
<P>

	1.	The contemnor is found guilty of contempt of this court for failing to
comply with order 3 made by the Hnourable Simpson J on
1 April 1997, as
extended by the honourable Bruce J on 7 April 1997, and the operation of which
was continued by order of the honourable
James J on 30 June 1997, in that the
contemnor did communicate in writing with two of the persons identified in the
schedule to the
order, namely Charles James Fletcher Perry and Judith Anne
Hermanson, and did in fact physically approach another person so named,
Stephen
Neil Gurney.
<P>

	2.	I order that the contemnor be admonished.
<P>

	3.	I further order that the contemnor pay the plaintiff's costs of and
incidental to these proceedings in the sum of $20,000, such
costs to be paid
three months from today.
<P>

	4.	I further order that in payment of those costs the contemnor shall be
deemed to have purged himself of his contempt.
<P>

	5.	I further order that in the meantime until that contempt is purged the
contemnor may not take any further action in relation
to his defence of the
proceedings commenced by the bank by statement of claim issued 21 July 1994 and
that the cross-claim filed
by him in the proceedings be stayed. 
<P>

	6.	Those orders do not preclude any action being taken in relation to the
proceedings for contempt or of course any appeal that
may be taken in relation
there to on the part of the contemnor.
<P>

	7.	I grant liberty to apply to me in relation to the matter on three day's
notice, or in the event of my unavailability liberty
to apply to the duty judge
on seven day's notice.
<P>
