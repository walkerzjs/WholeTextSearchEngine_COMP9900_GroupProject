<P>

<b>3286 of 1998 VERA MOSELEY v LESLIE MOSELEY</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  This is an application under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a></b> in respect of the estate of the late Norman Leslie Moseley who died on
5 March 1996.  The deceased was survived by his second wife,
the plaintiff, in
these proceedings, seven of his children by his first marriage and two step
children who are children of the plaintiff
by her first marriage.  
<P>

2	In 1936 the deceased had married his first wife, Vera, who died in October
1964.  At that stage the deceased had seven children
some of whom were quite
young.  The plaintiff who was born in 1921 married and had two daughters, Diane
and Nola.  Her husband died
in 1963.  The plaintiff and the deceased met in
1965 and in due course after the plaintiff's daughters married, the deceased
and
the plaintiff married in 1972.  They were together in what is clearly
accepted on the evidence as a close and loving relationship
until the death of
the deceased on 5 March 1996.  When the plaintiff and the deceased married
there were two children of the deceased
who were still living at home.  One was
the son, Terry who was then 17 and the other the son, Brent, who was then 12.
These children
remained at home for a while, Terry leaving in 1975 and Brent in
1978.  Both the plaintiff and the deceased retired in 1981.  
<P>

3	The deceased made his last will on 1 April 1985.  Under that will the
deceased appointed his son, Leslie Owen Moseley to be Executor
and Trustee and
gave his property in clause 3 of the will.  That clause is as follows:-
<P>

	"I give devise and bequeath all my property both real and personal whatsoever
and wheresoever situate unto my said Trustee upon
trust as follows:-
<P>

	1. To permit my wife VERA MAY MOSELEY to reside in the house known as 288
Lakemba Street, Lakemba (hereinafter called "my property")
as long as she
wishes provided she pays the rates and taxes levied on my property, the
premiums on any insurance policies taken out
and keeps my property in good
repair.
<P>

	2. Upon my said wife ceasing to live in the house permanently or to comply
with the conditions of her right of occupation my said
property shall be sold
and the proceeds of which shall be divided equally between the following
persons who survive me and attain
the age of eighteen (18) years if more than
one as tenants in common share and share alike:-
<P>

	VERA MAY MOSELEY, LESLIE MOSELEY, YVONNE BYERS, JOHNS MOSELEY, CLAUDETTE
SANDERFORD, GARY MOSELEY, TERRY MOSELEY, BRENT MOSELEY,
DIANE MARGARET LORING,
NOLA ROSE TANNER."
<P>

4	The plaintiff herself at the same time made a will in which she left her
property to her two daughters.  
<P>

5	The deceased's only assets at the date of his death were his property at 228
Lakemba Road, Lakemba and a sum of $18,000 in his
bank account.  A question
arises as to what is the proper disposition under his will of the money in his
bank account.  
<P>

6	It can be seen that in clause 3.1 there is a specific provision in respect of
the house.  The question which arises is whether
there is a residuary gift in
the will which effects a disposition of the $18,000 in the bank account.  The
plaintiff contends that
there is no residuary bequest and that she is entitled
to the sum on intestacy.  The defendant, on the other hand, contends that
clause 3.2 of the will should be properly construed as containing a gift of the
residuary personal estate to the ten named persons.
 This is said to arise from
the use of the words "my said property".  The submission pointed out that in
clause 3.1 reference is
made to the house in contrast to the reference made
later in 3.2 to the word "property".  Although one would normally construe such
a clause in a will in order to avoid an intestacy in this case this is not
possible.  Clause 3.1 defines the house as "my property"
and clause 3.2 picks
up that definition by use of the words, "my said property".  In addition clause
3.2 only disposes of the proceeds
of sale and the words used are not apt to
include cash or moneys in a bank account which can not be sold.  Thus I will
proceed on
the basis that the plaintiff was entitled to the $18,000 subject, of
course, to the costs of administration.
<P>

7	The matter is more complicated because the defendant, executor, has in fact
distributed the bank account  within the 18 months
period after the death of
the deceased and prior to any application in these proceedings.  The defendant
distributed the funds to
the ten persons named in clause 3.  This distribution
included the plaintiff.   The defendant did not publish any notice of intended
distribution and, accordingly, it would seem that his distribution has been
improper.  In these circumstances he should be taken
to have a right to recover
these funds from the beneficiaries to whom they were distributed apart from the
plaintiff.   I note that
none of the beneficiaries have put before the Court
any evidence of their financial situation and presumably the funds could be
recovered
by the executor to pay the costs of administration and then pay the
balance to the plaintiff.
<P>

8	In respect of the distribution the plaintiff herself, as I have mentioned,
received a cheque in respect of the partial distribution.
 That cheque she
banked.  She discussed the matter with the executor before the distribution and
expressed the view to him that the
funds should be kept in case anything was
necessary for the house.  Notwithstanding this she did accept it.  However, I
do not think
that one could suggest that she has acquiesced in that
distribution to the other beneficiaries.  She made a protest and it was
ignored.
 
<P>

9	There was a dispute in the evidence before me on the value of the property at
288 Lakemba Street, Lakemba.  This property comprised
a brick dwelling house on
one title, a small shop on another separate title at the front of the block and
a further vacant title.
 The shop had at one time been used by the deceased for
his barber's shop but at the date of death it was let to the proprietors
of a
video store.  Income in the order of $80 per week was received from this shop
and since the date of death the plaintiff has
received that income.  This has
been with the acquiescence of the executor.  A question which arises is whether
the plaintiff was
entitled to this income.  Her bequest was in respect of the
house, 288 Lakemba Street.  The shop is a different building in Lakemba
Street
and, accordingly, she would not be entitled to that income.
<P>

10	Evidence was given for the defendants by Mr Randall, a valuer, and he valued
the property which included all the real estate
and improvements at $277,000.
Mr Coleman, valuer, gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff.  He had been
engaged to report on some
offers that had been made for the property.  His
valuation was that the property was worth $350,000 although he was prepared to
accept
that an offer for $330,000 reflected the lower end of the range of a
range of $330,000 to $350,000 which could be obtained on the
sale of the
property.  He also addressed the value of the property having regard to the
plaintiff's life interest or right of residence.
<P>

11	The subject land is in an area which was subject to redevelopment for
commercial interests and this is a matter to which I will
return later.
However, there was another property, 280 Lakemba Street, which sold for the
purposes of redevelopment for a therapeutic
massage centre.  That sale showed a
price of $344 per square metre for the site.  There were other sales but none
really comparable
given their different zoning and history.  Mr Coleman's
valuation represented a substantial increase in value per square metre. 
He
endeavoured to justify this by reference to the possible commercial
redevelopment and the fact that the property was closer to
a corner.  I did not
find his arguments convincing.  I would accept that the value of the property
is more appropriately as stated
by Mr Randall.  He had another comparable sale
which assisted him in arriving at his valuation. 
<P>

12	The present application has been made out of time.  Time expired on 5
September 1997 and the proceedings were only commenced
on 24 July 1998. 
<P>

13		Accordingly it is necessary for the court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> to consider whether to allow an application to be made
notwithstanding it is out of time.  There are a number of cases which refer
to
the principles to be applied in an application for an extension of time.  In
<b>Re Guskett (deceased)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1947/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] VicLawRp 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%20VLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) VLR 211</a> the following was said:
<P>

	"It is necessary for the applicant to make out a case that will justify the
grant of the indulgence sought. He is to show reasons
why his failure to apply
within the time allowed should be excused.  Every case will have to be dealt
with on its own facts but it
would seem necessary for the applicant to satisfy
the court that the circumstances are such as to make it unjust for him to be
penalised
for being out of time.  As moreover he is seeking an indulgence he
should apply promptly for an extension of time."
<P>

14	His Honour Young J has in several cases dealt with the principles governing
applications to extend time under this Act.  In <b>Massie v Laundry</b>
(unreported 7 February 1986) he indicated that the factors which one looks at
include the following:-
<P>

	(a) is the reason for making a late claim sufficient?
<P>

	(b) will the beneficiaries under the will be unacceptably prejudiced if the
time were extended?
<P>

	(c) has there been any unconscionable conduct on either side which would enter
into the equation?
<P>

15		He also accepts apparently a view which was expressed by his Honour Needham
J in <b>Fancett v Ware</b> (3 June 1986) that there is no purpose in extending
the time with respect to a claim which must fail.  In <b>Phillips v Quinton</b>
(unreported 31 March 1988) Powell J when considering the matter at the
substantive hearing leant to the view that a plaintiff seeking
an extension of
time under the Testators Family Maintenance Act must now demonstrate not merely
a reasonable prospect but at least
a strong probability of obtaining
substantive relief.  That view was not accepted by his Honour Hodgson J in
<b>Basto v Basto </b>(unreported 8 September 1989).  
<P>

16		In <b>De Winter v Johnston</b>, a decision of the Court of Appeal on 23
August 1995 his Honour Powell J referred to this matter and in particular the
fact that
nowadays the application for extension of time is invariably dealt
with at the time of the application for substantive relief.  He
said at page
23:
<P>

	"In such a case, so it seems to me no extension of time ought to be granted
unless it be established (inter alia) that the application
for an extension of
time would, in the event of that extension being granted, be entitled to an
order for substantive relief."
<P>

17	There have been a number of first instance decisions in which this approach
has been followed.  See for example <b>Warren v McKnight</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1996/419.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] NSWSC 419</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR
390</a> and <b>Dare v Furness</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2044%20NSWLR%20493" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 44 NSWLR 493.</a>
<P>

18	I turn to the question of the explanation for the delay that is proffered by
the plaintiff for lateness in making her application.
 This explanation and the
facts surrounding it have to be judged bearing in mind that the plaintiff had
the right to reside in the
house as long as she wished under the terms of the
deceased's will.  I have mentioned that the property was in an area which was
likely to be redeveloped and there were efforts over a period of some two and a
half years after the death of the deceased by a developer
to put together a
development proposal encompassing a number of properties including the house in
which the plaintiff had the right
to reside.  This led to approaches from three
people, one of whom may have been acting for the final developer with whom
discussions
were held.  
<P>

19	After the funeral of the deceased there was evidence by the sister of the
first defendant, Mrs Martin, that she did raise with
the plaintiff the question
of whether or not she wanted to continue to live in the house now her husband
was dead.  She was informed
that it was the plaintiff's desire to do so it
having been their home.  The first approach from someone on behalf of
developers was
from Mr Kennedy.  The initial approach from Mr Kennedy and
discussions he had with the plaintiff led her to seek advice and she has
sworn
to the fact that on 20 January 1997, or about that time, she obtained advice
about the <b>Family Provisions Act</b> from her solicitor, Margaret Hole.  Her
solicitor made her aware that there was a time limit of 18 months from her
husband's death
in which to bring any claim.  Thereafter there were apparently
further discussions.  There is in evidence a letter from Mr Kennedy
of 16 May
1997 which refers to a proposal for redevelopment.  Part of that proposal was
the purchase of another house to accommodate
the plaintiff elsewhere which
would be held upon the same terms as the provisions of the will of the
deceased.  Mr Kennedy seems
to have dropped out of the picture after that
because in October 1997 there is a note to the plaintiff from Dr Burns, one of
the
interested developers, who owned a property nearby.  He was apparently
involved in the development with a Mr Pignat.  It maybe that
Mr Kennedy was a
consultant who was previously employed by Mr Pignat but after October the
discussions seemed to be continuing between
the plaintiff and Mr Pignat.  In
January 1998 there was a meeting with Mr Pignat and members of the family to
discuss the proposal
for the redevelopment.
<P>

20	In a letter of 14 January 1998 Mr Pignat addressed a proposal to the Moseley
family for an option for $330,000.  Clearly that
proposal was predicated upon
Mrs Moseley, the plaintiff, moving to another dwelling and purchasing it
because it refers to a share
for Mrs Moseley of $33,000 and her daughters two
shares, for similar amounts, being put towards the purchase of another dwelling
for her.  It also refers to the balance of the purchase price for this new
dwelling being provided by the developer and with the
legal costs to be paid
for by the developer.  There are a number of different versions in the evidence
of what occurred at that meeting.
 Claudette Martin referred to the fact that
all that was offered was an option and that the plaintiff had said to Mr Pignat
words
to the effect that she had everything where she was presently residing,
that she had the rent from the shop and in effect did not
wish to move.  
<P>

21	The defendant also gave evidence that after the meeting the plaintiff said
that she was happy living in the house and for various
reasons which she
expressed, she did not want to move.  
<P>

22	The plaintiff herself indicated that she was not certain what she wanted to
do but she did say she was quite happy living there,
that it provided for all
her needs and she did not consider moving at that time.  It is apparently some
time later that the thought
of construction work going on around her made her
give further consideration to the proposal.  
<P>

23	On 30 March 1998 Mrs Moseley received a further offer from Mr Pignat which
was in similar terms to the previous one.  However,
in this offer there was
specified an amount of extra provision to be provided by the syndicate to the
plaintiff for her to put towards
the purchase of a house.  The amount was
$126,000 increased by the consumer price index plus stamp duty, legal and other
costs. 
It was contemplated that this sum plus $99,000 from the other shares to
which the plaintiff and her daughters were entitled, would
be used to purchase
a house for her.  In a letter typed by her daughter and sent to her solicitor,
the plaintiff sought her solicitor's
advice because she was unsure of what she
should do.  Around this time there was a proposal from a Mr Websdale but
nothing seems
to have eventuated from this as the plaintiff did not trust him.

<P>

24	Towards the end of May or early June the plaintiff, in discussing the
proposal with Mr Pignat, asked him to give details to the
defendant but
omitting the amount that was going to be paid to her of $126,000.  Accordingly,
he sent a letter of 2 June addressed
to her but obviously forwarded to the
defendant, Mr Moseley, on the plaintiff's instructions which simply omitted the
amount of the
additional provision to be provided to her.  Reference was made
simply to an additional amount to be provided.  In the absence of
an amount in
that letter, Claudette Martin, rang up Mr Pignat and asked him the amount.  She
was informed that the amount was in
the order of $130,000 or less.  She rang
because she could not see the point of having a meeting unless she knew the
amount.  The
meeting was convened on 21 June and the plaintiff, the defendant,
his siblings and the plaintiff's daughters attended.  Mr Pignat
also attended.
Apparently this was not expected by the plaintiff.  
<P>

25	At the meeting it was disclosed by the plaintiff's daughter, Diane, that her
mother no longer wished to live in the Lakemba house.
 The defendant found out
about the amount of $126,000 which was to be paid to the plaintiff directly as
well as the purchase price
for the property the amount of which had not changed
throughout negotiations.  There was discussion at the meeting which probably
made it clear that the total amount offered was $330,00 plus $126,000.  The
plaintiff was asked in whose name the property was to
be purchased and the
reply was that it was to be in her name.  There is no doubt that it was made
perfectly clear that the plaintiff
would get substantially more than the
others.  According to the plaintiff the defendant said that they, namely, he
and his siblings
were not going to go ahead with any agreement which saw the
plaintiff get $126,000 or any amount in excess of the amount the rest
of them
would receive.  This conversation was not denied by the defendant.
<P>

26	Mr Pignat could see that the matter was not getting anywhere and the meeting
broke up.  Thereafter the plaintiff gave instructions
to commence proceedings
and the proceedings were commenced the next month.  The property is still owned
by the estate, the plaintiff
still lives in it and there is now no current
proposal for a developer to buy the property.  
<P>

27	There was a lot of heat generated in this case about the circumstances in
which the plaintiff in calling the final meeting endeavoured
to have Mr Pignat
not give the details of the amount she was to receive.  In giving her evidence
on this aspect I found the plaintiff
evasive in answering questions about this
aspect and it is clear to me that she intended the others not to know about the
payment
to her.  It would also seem clear that the children of the deceased did
not know the amount of the extra payment which she had managed
to negotiate
with Mr Pignat until just before the meeting in June although they must have
been aware from the earlier offers that
there was some proposal for her to be
paid some money.
<P>

28	The importance of this question of the extra payment to the plaintiff is not
really clear.  It seems that it was not fully explored
by the parties at the
meeting.  It seems clear that the defendant was not prepared to accept the
plaintiff getting this extra amount
of money and Claudette Martin, his sister,
appears never to have reached the stage of deciding whether or not that may
have been
important.  In her mind the fact that the option was for two years
with no value to the estate or the plaintiff, particularly as
she, the
plaintiff, now wished to move to new premises, seemed to put an end to any
consideration of the final arrangement.
<P>

29	It is necessary to see how the plaintiff puts her explanation for the delay.
Not unlike many people in her situation the plaintiff
was upset by her
husband's death and did not realise that she ought to have given consideration
to her future needs.  She was certainly
happy living in the house.  She did not
initially think it might be inappropriate in the future.  These concerns were
ones which
probably pre-date her obtaining advice in about January 1997 from a
solicitor about the possibility of making a claim.  Her other
explanations are
that she hoped some arrangement could be made with the defendant and his family
to enable another residence to be
purchased if the Lakemba house were sold.
She got to a point where she realised that the defendant and the family would
not agree
to another house being purchased and she hoped, encouraged by the
various property developers that she would get sufficient from
that sale to
provide for a house for herself in her own right.  She then says that it was
only when this proposal was vetoed in June
that she realised that she would
have to fend for herself and commence these proceedings.
<P>

30	There is a dispute on the evidence about conversations in respect of the
second aspect, the explanation, between the plaintiff
and the defendant in
about mid 1997 when she mentioned being pestered by a developer and asked the
defendant whether the proceeds
of sale could be used to buy another property
for her.  She says the defendant said, "Definitely no".
<P>

31	It seems to me, having heard the evidence and particularly considering the
type of offer that was being made by the developer,
that what the defendant was
saying was in fact that there was no point accepting such an option because
there was no benefit to the
defendant, i.e. at the end of the two year period
the option may not be exercised and nothing would have been achieved in that
time.
 It is also likely that the discussion was between Mr Moseley and Mr
Kennedy who reported the conversation to the plaintiff.  It
is not unnatural
that the plaintiff should misinterpret these comments, particularly as she says
she had a firm belief that such
a proposal was likely to succeed.  
<P>

32	The defendant's case on this aspect is that it was not until after January
1998 that the plaintiff considered that the provision
made for her was not
sufficient.  She had had the benefit of advice in January 1997 about her right
to claim and it was only when
she found a developer in early 1998 who was
prepared to pay her a substantial sum of money that she changed her mind and
decided
to pursue that option.  Ultimately, when that failed, she commenced
proceedings.  In these circumstances the defendant submits that
that there has
not been an adequate explanation.  
<P>

33	The difficulty with the matter is that the plaintiff knew in January 1997
that the time limit would expire in September 1997.
 She seems to have let that
opportunity go by and even in January 1998 she was still saying she wanted to
live in the property.
<P>

34	Her change in heart was a result of the dispute which occurred in June 1998
when it became clear to her that she was unlikely
to obtain sufficient funds
from the sale to a developer to purchase a house.  
<P>

35	I have above referred to the principles which the Court follows when
deciding these questions of extension of time.  There does
not seem to be much
doubt about the principles.  Their application to the facts in each case is
always a matter of difficulty.  For
this reason one must be cautious when
applying decisions on facts in other cases to the case in hand.
<P>

36	In <b>Bearns v Bearns-Hayes,</b> Young J unreported 7 May 1997, His Honour
spent some time considering the various authorities dealing with extension of
time.  His
Honour was there concerned with a case where a widow made an
application sixteen months out of time.  That was a case concerning
a large
estate of some $4 million in which the widow had been left a quarter share of
the house and some other funds.  There was
provision in the will which required
the house not to be sold for twelve years but, in fact, that was not sufficient
to have prevented
its sale and the eviction of the plaintiff from her home.
His Honour analysed the facts and found that the uncontradicted evidence
showed
that up until late 1984 the plaintiff had no intention of making an
application.  It was also almost certainly the case that
she did not know that
there was a right to make an application but even if she had known she had no
motivation to do so.  She had
assurances from her family that her possession of
the property at Riverwood was secure, she had income flowing to her from the
estate
investments and she had about $230,000 of her own.  His Honour then
referred to the change which occurred in the second half of 1994
when serious
arguments broke out between the parties.  His Honour concluded that the
alteration to the picture because of family
arguments at the end of 1984 and
the beginning of 1995 was insufficient to amount to sufficient facts within s
16(3).  Accordingly,
he refused the application to extend time. 
<P>

37	In <b>Re Guskett,</b> to which I have referred, there was a failure to
proceed because the Executors were making an allowance to the plaintiff to
support
herself and her children which later was found to be inadequate.  This
was held to be insufficient cause.  At page 215 Herring CJ
said:-
<P>

	"In a case such as the present the applicant is, I think, unable to show any
reasons why I should grant the indulgence sought.
 Hade she only recently
become aware of her rights under Part V the case would have been very
different, but a person who is aware
of them within the time specified and
chooses for some reason satisfactory to her at the time not to exercise them,
cannot come years
afterwards and demand an extension of time on the ground that
she now finds it desirable to exercise them.  She had her opportunity
and such
injustice as she may now consider herself to be suffering is her own doing and
not one brought about by the time limit from
which she seeks to be relieved.
Her reasons for now applying to the Court may appear to her sufficiently
compelling, but they do
not afford any ground for excusing her failure to
prosecute her application within the time allowed."
<P>

38	In <b>Re Lauer </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1984/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] VicRp 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20VR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) VR 180</a> Young J held that a deterioration in an
applicant's financial position cannot of itself be ground for granting an
extension of time
nor can the mere fact that the value of the estate has been
inflated beyond what might have been expected could be a ground.  Other
factors
which are sufficient appear for example in <b>Neil v Knott</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2068%20ALJR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 68 ALJR
509</a> where illness and poverty were sufficient to allow an extension.
<P>

39	The difficulty in the matter is that the factual situation in <b>Bearns v
Bearns-Hayes</b> is almost identical to the present situation.  The approach to
the problem in <b>Re Lauer</b> was relied upon by Young J in <b>Bearns.  </b>It
is a similar approach to that in <b>Re Guskett </b>to which I have referred.
Such decisions are binding on me and, accordingly, I must conclude that the
explanation for the delay is
not sufficient to amount to sufficient facts
within s 16(3).  Notwithstanding that I have found this way I will deal with
the remainder
of the application in case some other Court should take a
different view.<b> </b>
<P>

40	The next matter to be considered is whether the beneficiaries under the will
would be unacceptably prejudiced if the time were
extended.  The only matter
raised on this aspect is the fact that there are no assets in the estate other
than the property and that
there will be substantial costs.  The plaintiff's
costs are approximately $22,600 and the defendant's costs to date will be in
the
order of $15,000.  The fact of incurring these costs is not per se a matter
of prejudice.  That is more a matter of inevitability
in litigation.  The
improper distribution of the proceeds of the bank account partly exacerbate
that matter.  However, the property
has not been sold.  In the circumstances I
am satisfied that the application of itself being late causes no prejudice.

<P>

41	The next matter to consider is whether there has been any unconscionable
behaviour on the part of the plaintiff.  Certainly the
case has been fought on
this issue.  The defendant certainly believed that the attitude of the
plaintiff in making separate arrangements
with the developer for herself
constitutes unconscionable conduct.  However, in my view, although the
plaintiff was secretive about
it, it really was a matter which concerned her.
She was quite entitled to endeavour to obtain the best deal she could.  She
after
all was the owner of the right of residence and it was a right that has
to be accommodated if the property were to be developed.
 There does not seem
to have been any compromise of the offer to purchase the interest in remainder
by the proposed purchaser of
the property as a result of her endeavours.  In
these circumstances I cannot see that this is unconscionable conduct.  In
particular
it should be noted that the valuation which the plaintiff obtained
clearly indicated that the developer's offer was appropriate in
offering an
extra amount to the plaintiff for her right of residence.  In my view there is
no unconscionable conduct on the part
of the plaintiff.
<P>

42	It is necessary to consider the prospects of success of the plaintiff in the
event that time were extended.  Accordingly, I will
continue further with this
aspect of the case before finally deciding whether or not to extend time.
<P>

43	In applications under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> </b>the High Court has
recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two stage
approach that a Court must take.  At page 209 it said the following:-
<P>

	"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

	The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

44	As directed by the High Court I turn to the plaintiff's situation.  She is
presently 78 years of age and in good health.  She
lives in the deceased's
house and is able to manage competently in that house.  Her only assets consist
of funds which she has saved.
 At the date of the death of the deceased she had
funds of some $15,000 which she had saved in her own account.  These have now
grown
to approximately $31,000.  She has no car or other assets other than
minor personal possessions.  
<P>

45	The defendant has placed before the court no evidence of the financial
circumstances of either himself or his brothers and sisters.
 Similarly no
evidence has been placed before the court of the means of the plaintiff's
daughters although I do note that there seems
to be evidence that they were
happy for their share of the estate to be provided to their mother.  In these
circumstances, the court
can in giving consideration to whether there has been
adequate provision for the plaintiff put to one side the financial situation
of
any of the other beneficiaries.  
<P>

46	This raises quite squarely whether or not the provision made for the
plaintiff by way of a right of residence is an appropriate
one.  The matter has
been debated in a number of cases over the years.  The High Court in <b>White
White v Barron</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1924/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%2d1980%29%20144%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979-1980) 144 CLR 431</a> at page 444 had the following to
say:-
<P>

	"A capital provision should only be awarded to a widow when it appears that
this is the fairest means of securing her proper maintenance.
 However, the
provision of a large capital sum for a widow who is not young, may, in the
event of her early death, result in a substantial
benefit to her relatives,
contrary to the wishes of the testator, when a benefit of another kind would
have afforded an adequate
safeguard to her personally, without leaving her in a
position in which she could benefit her relatives from the proceeds of the
legacy."
<P>

47	In the present case, of course, the problem referred to by the High Court is
manifest.  The arrangements made by the plaintiff
and the deceased contemplated
to the knowledge of both parties that the plaintiff's assets, which were only
her savings, were to
go to her daughters.  In the event that the plaintiff
retains the fee simple in the property, which is her request to the court,
then
clearly this would be to the advantage of her daughters in due course as that
is still the provision in her will.
<P>

48	There are variety of different orders which a court can make and there are
many first instance judgments where these are discussed.
 For example, in
<b>Court v Hunt</b>, Young J (unreported) 14 September 1987, he said:
<P>

	"Old age is a growing problem in our community and judges who sit in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> applications get experience, as well as their own experience in
the community, as to what happens when people reach the age when
they can no
longer look after themselves and one judges the evidence in these sort of
proceedings against that background knowledge."
<P>

49		His Honour then went on to talk about the assumptions one could make about
the fact that frequently, people, once they pass
fifty-five, have to change
their accommodation and locate themselves either in retirement villages or
nursing homes which have different
requirements for capital contribution.
<P>

50		After talking about the evidence necessary, his Honour went on to say:
<P>

	"In many cases these days a life estate will not be sufficient because it does
not cover the situation of the plaintiff moving
from her own home to retirement
village to nursing home to hospital.  Sometimes it is possible for a court to
alter a life estate
to a more flexible non-capital provision, such as was done
by Holland J in <b>Crisp v Burns Philp Trustee Co Ltd</b>, 18 December 1979,
unreported, but noted in Mason &amp; Handler Probate Service, at page 13206.
Other times the proper provision
is for a fee simple gift, realising that this
property will be sold and will be turned over into the appropriate property to
maintain
the widow for the rest of her life.   Care also has to be given by
those administering the plaintiff's property to ensure that there
is sufficient
income being raised after tax that will provide for maintenance levies and the
other payments that have to be made
by the widow."
<P>

51	In dealing with the provisions normally made in respect of widows the Court
of Appeal in <b>Golosky &amp; Anor v Golosky</b>, unreported 5 October 1993,
summarised them in the following terms:
<P>

	"In testing the Master's decision it is appropriate to keep in mind the
principles which governed the approach which he was obliged
to take to the
widow's application under the Act.  Relevantly, these included:
<P>

	(a)	Proper respect was to be paid for the right of testamentary disposition
which is the fundamental premise upon which the provisions
of the Act are
based.  That premise requires the Court, out of respect for the continuing
right of testamentary disposition, to limit
its disturbance of the testator's
will to that which is necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act, and not
more.  See <b>The Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith and St
Charles Seminary, Perth v Scales </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20107%20CLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 107 CLR 9</a>, 19; <b>White v Barron
and Anor</b>, above, 458; <b>Hunter</b>, above, 576;
<P>

	(b)	The purpose of the jurisdiction is not the correction of the hurt feelings
of sense of wrong of the competing claimants upon
the estate of the testator.
The Court is obliged simply to respond to the application of the eligible
person who was a member of
the testator's household and to consider whether, as
claimed, the provision made by the will is inadequate for that person's proper
maintenance and advancement in life. See <b>Heyward v Fisher</b>, Court of
Appeal, unreported, 26 April 1985; (1985) NSWJB 81.
<P>

	(c)	Consideration of other cases must be conducted with circumspection because
of the inescapable detail of the factual circumstances
of each case.  It is in
the detail that the answer to the proper application of the Act is to be
discovered.  No hard and fast rules
can be adopted.  Nevertheless, it had been
said that in the absence of special circumstances, it will normally be the duty
of a testator
to ensure that a spouse (or spouse equivalent) is provided with a
place to live appropriate to that which he or she has become accustomed
to.  To
the extent that the assets available to the deceased will permit such a course,
it is normally appropriate that the spouse
(or spouse equivalent) should be
provided, as well, with a fund to meet unforeseen contingencies; see
<b>Luciano</b> (above) 69-70; 
<P>

	(d)	A mere right of residence will usually be an unsatisfactory method of
providing for a spouse's accommodation to fulfil the
foregoing normal
presupposition.  This is because a spouse may be compelled by sickness, age,
urgent supervening necessity or otherwise,
with good reason, to leave the
residence.  The spouse provided and will then be left without the kind of
protection which is normally
expected will be provided by a testator who is
both wise and just.  See <b>Moore v Moore</b>, Court of Appeal, unreported, 16
May 1984, per Hutley JA; 
<P>

	(e)	Considering what is 'proper' and by inference what is 'improper' as a
provision in a will, it is appropriate to take into account
all of the
circumstances of the case including such matters as the nature and quality of
the relationship between the testator and
the claimant; the character and
conduct of the claimant; the present and reasonably anticipated future needs of
the claimant; the
size and nature of the estate and of any relevant
dispositions which may have reduced the estate available for distribution
according
to the will; the nature and relative strengths of the competing
claims of testamentary recognition; and any contributions of the
claimant to
the property or to the welfare of the deceased.  See <b>Re Fulop</b> Deceased
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 679 (SC)</a>; <b>Churton v Christian and Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 241
(CA)</a>, 252."
<P>

52		In talking of the need to provide a house and a sum for contingencies the
President is clearly referring to <b>Wellman</b> and passages in <b>Luciano v
Rosenblum </b>and other cases.  As was pointed out by the Court of Appeal in
<b>Elliott v Elliott</b>, unreported, 29 April 1986, such a type of provision
only applies where it can be said there has been a long and happy marriage and
a widow has helped build up the estate of the deceased.
<P>

53	There is no doubt that there has been a long and happy marriage in this
case.  The plaintiff and the deceased were married for
24 years.  So far as
assistance with building the assets are concerned, the house which was the
subject of the application, was one
which had been acquired by the deceased
during his first marriage.  During that marriage an old building was removed
and a fresh
building erected in the 1960s.  This was with the benefit of a War
Service Homes loan which was repaid in later years at a rate of
$26 per month.
The loan itself was finally discharged in 1991 when the deceased paid the final
$4,000 due on the loan.  To an extent
there has been a contribution by the
plaintiff as she and the defendant both worked up until 1981 and the plaintiff
contributed her
wages partly towards meeting the expenses of the household.
There was no suggestion that she paid any mortgage instalment but there
was the
use of her salary to this extent.
<P>

54	At the heart of the concern of the children of the first marriage is the
fact that the house was substantially provided by their
parents rather than the
deceased and his second wife.  However, one has to have regard to community
expectations of what would be
appropriate for what is, in this case, a long and
happy relationship with some assistance towards paying off a loan for a house.
The defendant has since the conclusion of the hearing submitted the terms of
what it says is an appropriate provision 
<P>

55	Such terms gave a right of residence in the property or any substituted
property which the plaintiff might require for the provision
of accommodation
in an appropriate Church, Government or private institution provided that any
non-refundable capital contribution
would not be in excess of 33 percent of the
capital lump sum.  There is no evidence which suggests that this figure is in
line with
market practice and it seems a little restrictive.  
<P>

56	In my view it would have been appropriate in this case for the plaintiff to
have received the property outright having regard
to the length of her
marriage.  However as time can not be extended the only order that should be
made is that the Summons is dismissed
and I so order.
<P>

57	I will hear argument as to costs.
