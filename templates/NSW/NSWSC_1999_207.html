<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY 5 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>4861/98 - CLEARY V MASTERTON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    The plaintiffs are solicitors of this Court who
practise under the name of Walsh &amp; Blair at Wagga Wagga.  They were sued by
the defendant in connection with a problem that arose out of an estate.  The
defendant also sued persons closer to the estate as
second defendants.  Those
proceedings were number 5485/93 in this Division.
<P>

2	In May of 1998 discussions took place between the solicitors for the three
sets of parties.  Those discussions produced a settlement
between the present
defendant, Mrs Masterton, and the second defendants in the earlier proceedings.
Messrs Walsh &amp; Blair contend
that Mrs Masterton also settled the
proceedings against them on the basis that the claim would be discontinued,
each party would
pay their own costs and that Mrs Masterton would execute a
deed of release.  Mrs Masterton denies that there was any such agreement
and
Walsh &amp; Blair have sued for specific performance.
<P>

3	The evidence has been given by two solicitors, employed by Phillips Fox at
the time of the settlement negotiations, who appear
to have been instructed by
LawCover and because of that act for Walsh &amp; Blair.  The solicitors say
that on about 20 May 1998
after discussions with Mrs Masterton's then
solicitors it appeared to everybody that the probability of settlement was
high.
<P>

4	On 25 May 1998 Mr Boyd, Mrs Masterton's former solicitor, rang Phillips Fox
and asked whether they had instructions to settle,
and was told that LawCover
were agreeable to settlement, Walsh &amp; Blair had not yet given instructions,
but there should not be
a problem.  The proposed settlement would be on the
basis of a discontinuance of the action and that all parties enter into a deed
of release and pay their own costs.  Mr Boyd replied, "That seems fine, it
looks like we have settled."
<P>

5	On the same day Phillips Fox sent Mr Boyd a letter which referred, for some
reason or other, to a conversation on 20 May, and
said:
<P>

"We advise our client is prepared to bear its own costs of the proceedings on
the basis that:
<P>

*  Your client's claim against our client is discontinued;
<P>

*  The parties execute a Deed of Release in favour of our client;
<P>

*  There is no order as to costs.
<P>

Our client's offer will remain open until 23 June 1998.
<P>

This offer is made strictly without prejudice but on condition that you are
advised ... <b> Calderbank v Calderbank </b> ..."
<P>

It will be noted that there seems to be a shift from mutual releases to a
release of Walsh &amp; Blair.
<P>

6	The matter was listed for call over on 1 June 1998 and  on 29 May 1998 the
solicitors had a conference and Mr Boyd said:
<P>

"The matter is settled as far as I am concerned.  I am happy with your fax and
I agree to the matter being stood over for six weeks
to allow settlement
documentation to be prepared. I will ring the second defendants' solicitors to
see if they are happy with these
arrangements and get back to you."
<P>

7	Later that day he did ring back and indicated that the second  defendants in
proceedings 5485/93 were agreeable to the matter
being stood over for six
weeks.
<P>

8	The Phillips Fox solicitor said she would have her colleague mention the
matter on 1 June on that basis, but Mr Boyd then said:
<P>

	"My client may now only settle with the second defendants and I am still
considering the position with respect to the first defendant."
<P>

9	The Phillips Fox solicitor made no comment about that utterance.
<P>

10	While those considerations were going on there was correspondence which does
not really fit in nicely with what was being said
between the lawyers.
<P>

11	On 28 May 1998 Mr Boyd wrote to Phillips Fox confirming that his client
consented to a disposal of the matter along the lines
proposed in Phillips
Fox's letter of 25 May, and said that he was awaiting reception of the deed of
release at Phillips Fox's earliest
convenience.
<P>

12	On 5 June he again wrote to Phillips Fox saying that he had not received the
deed of release:
<P>

	"As soon as that document has been sent my client will execute same and will
be returned to you fairly shortly in the hope that
this matter can be resolved
in all it's [sic] aspects by 13 July, 1998."
<P>

	Presumably that was the date to which the matter had been stood over.
<P>

13	A new solicitor then took over the matter at Phillips Fox.  He sent a draft
deed of release and a draft deed of notice of discontinuance
to Mr Boyd by fax
on 18 June 1998. With respect, although the deed was not the best example of
the drafter's art,  it certainly fell
within the description of a deed of
release.  However, there could be legitimate debate as to some of its
provisions.
<P>

14	On 1 July 1998 Mr Boyd told Phillips Fox that he had ceased to act.
Thereafter Mrs Masterton represented herself.
<P>

15	Mrs Masterton has filed an affidavit, which contains a letter from Mr Boyd
to her of 1 June 1998, which notes her instructions
only to settle against the
other defendants and then says:
<P>

	"The Solicitors acting on behalf of Walsh and Blair are also hopeful that you
will discontinue your case against them and they
are prepared to withdraw and
seek no Order as to costs if you do likewise.  I note you have instructed me
that you feel that they
are responsible for some of the loss you have suffered
and you should be able to extract damages from them.
<P>

	I appreciate your point but ... "
<P>

16	Mr Boyd then gave advice as to why Mrs Masterton would be wise to settle,
which advice she rejected.
<P>

17	On 1 July, according to exhibit PX01, Mr Boyd wrote to the Legal Aid
Commission that Mrs Masterton wished to pursue the action
against Walsh &amp;
Blair.  The letter stated that in view of the offer of settlement which had
been made by Phillips Fox and the
solicitors acting for the other defendants,
Mrs Masterton's claim would be quite speculative and therefore he had ceased to
represent
her  because she had declined to accept his reasonable advice.
<P>

18	On that material I am asked to say that there is a settlement of the former
proceedings which should be specifically enforced.
<P>

19	If it be the fact that Mr Boyd actually settled the case with Phillips Fox
even though Mrs Masterton had told him not to, then
under the principle of<b>
Harvey v Phillips</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2095%20CLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 95 CLR 235</a> there may still be a contract to settle
the action because ordinarily the solicitor on the record is presumed to have
authority to
settle.  Accordingly, I do not need to direct my mind to that
aspect of the case.
<P>

20	The matter that I need to consider is whether there is a binding contract to
settle.
<P>

21	In all cases of this nature, the court starts by looking at the various
possibilities which were outlined by the High Court in
<b>Masters v Cameron</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 353</a>, 360.  In that case the High Court said that there were three
categories of agreement and it was necessary to look at the intention
of the
parties, as manifested by their actions, as to which of the categories a
particular fact situation fell into.  
<P>

22	(1)	There could be an informal contract which was intended by the parties to
be immediately binding; in effect a provisional
contract which was intended to
be replaced by a more formal contract later; 
<P>

23	(2)	There could be an arrangement which would only become contractual if a
condition were fulfilled;
<P>

24	(3)	There could be the situation where although the parties had agreed on
the major matters, such as price or property, there
were so many aspects still
remaining to be considered that the parties would not have intended to have
been bound at all.
<P>

25	In<b> G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2040%20NSWLR%20631" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 40 NSWLR 631</a> (an appeal from McLelland CJ in Eq reported at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2040%20NSWLR%20622" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 40
NSWLR 622)</a> the Court of Appeal said there was actually a fourth category, that
is where the parties had entered into a fully binding contract
even though they
intended in due course to supplement it or replace it by a contract containing
additional terms.  This is known
as the fourth category of <b>Masters v
Cameron</b> and it is into that class or, alternatively, the first or  second
classes that Mr Curtin, counsel for Walsh &amp; Blair, says this
present case
falls.
<P>

26	In<b> Jameson v Central Electricity Generating Board</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20All%20ER%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 All ER
193</a>, the House of Lords introduced additional consideration into the case where
the contract is one of settlement of litigation.
<P>

27	The judgment of Lord Hope, who gave the leading judgment, says that one has
always to analyse settlement contracts which have
not been fully implemented to
see whether as soon as the contract was made there has been a discharge of the
cause of action subject
to an implied resolutive condition, which would render
the settlement void ab initio if the condition was not satisfied, or whether
there is a settlement which is only to come into effect when a condition
precedent is performed (see p 207).
<P>

28	Accordingly, even if a plaintiff in this sort of case shows the court that
there was a contract under the second head of<b> Masters v Cameron</b>,
attention  must then be paid to whether the condition is a condition precedent
or subsequent.  If it is a condition precedent, then
it must be shown that it
either occurred or has not occurred due to no fault on behalf of the
plaintiff.
<P>

29	One has got to look at the intention of the parties, though in this case the
intention of Mrs Masterton must be looked at through
the actions of Mr Boyd.
That has a few problems in that what Mr Boyd said and what he wrote are not
necessarily consistent, and it
may well be that Mr Boyd was unduly optimistic
in what he said to Phillips Fox, hoping that his client would take his advice.
However,
all I can do is to look at the communication between the parties to
see whether there was a contract.
<P>

30	Phillips Fox's letter of 25 May is not the clearest example of an offer
which can simply be accepted.  The proposition is not
directly put as an offer
of settlement, but merely what LawCover is prepared to do to facilitate
settlement negotiations with the
plaintiff and the other defendants.
<P>

31	This is understandable in all the circumstances because it would appear that
what Mr Boyd was doing, as would have been understood
by the Phillips Fox
lawyers, was trying to settle with the main defendants in proceedings 5485/93,
the estate defendants, but he
could not do that unless he knew that LawCover
were prepared to walk away from the proceedings and pay their own costs.
<P>

32	However, even if one takes, as I do, the letter of 25 May as an offer to
settle by Walsh &amp; Blair, the offer certainly does
focus on there being a
deed of release and a discontinuance.
<P>

33	I note as a side comment that although the conversations between the
solicitors were in the terms of mutual releases, the offer
in the letter is
only for a release of Walsh &amp; Blair.
<P>

34	What then was the response?  The formal response from Mr Boyd was on 28 May
that:
<P>

	"My client consents to a disposal of the matter along the lines proposed".
<P>

35	I think this is too mealymouthed to be an acceptance. It is really a
conditional acceptance.  But even if it is an acceptance,
as a matter of law it
seems to me that it falls into the category of merely indicating that the
principal terms are agreed to, but
there will not be a contract until the
formal deed of release is agreed to and signed.
<P>

36	Mr Curtin, in his submissions, which I think, with respect, covered
everything that could be said on behalf of the plaintiffs,
put that it was
consistent that there was no mention of the words "subject to" a deed of
release being sealed, as one would expect.
 I take this point and have weighed
it in the balance with the other matters.
<P>

37	Then there is the letter of 5 June which, in the light of correspondence
with the client, must again reflect Mr Boyd's optimism
that his client would
eventually take his advice, but this letter too focuses on the client executing
the deed of release so that
"this matter can be resolved in all it's [sic]
aspects by 13 July".  It seems to suggest it has not yet been resolved.
<P>

38	There was no response from Phillips Fox.  It would seem that there was no
response from Phillips Fox because the former solicitor
had got on to other
things and the new  solicitor had not yet commenced his employment, otherwise I
would have thought that there
was some significance in the fact that there had
been no contradiction of what Mr Boyd said.
<P>

39	Litigation in the Supreme Court is a serious matter and settlement of that
litigation is a serious matter.  If parties have brokered
a deal whereby there
is to be a deed of release and a discontinuance, the parties, to my mind,
intend as a general rule that there
is no contract until that release has been
delivered and exchanged and the notice of discontinuance is at least signed.
There may
be in any particular set of circumstances some other intention
manifested, but I think that is the general rule.
<P>

40	In the instant case, the parties had not reached that point.  Accordingly,
it seems to me that this is in the third category
of<b> Masters v Cameron,</b>
that there was to be no contract until the formalities had been completed.
<P>

41	Even if I were wrong on this and had to look at the matter exposed in<b>
Jameson's</b> <b>case</b>, in my view, the contract would have been subject to
a condition precedent, rather than a condition subsequent.
<P>

42	It is not a case, as was<b> Jameson,</b> where the settlement was to be
consummated by the payment of money, rather it was to be consummated by
documentation, and it is more
likely than not that the intention was that this
would be a condition precedent.
<P>

43	Accordingly, having fully considered the submissions made by Mr Curtin and
the evidence filed on behalf of the plaintiffs, as
well as that of the
defendant, I am not satisfied that the matter was settled.  
<P>

44	Before concluding, I should note that because I have found that there was no
concluded contract, I do not have to consider either
the ordinary rules as to
whether I should in my discretion order specific performance or the special
considerations involved where
 the court is asked to enforce an agreement to
settle litigation in the court;  see eg <b>Lewis v Combell Constructions Pty
Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 528.</a>
<P>

45	Thus, the present summons must be dismissed with costs.                 
<P>

	
<P>
