JUDGMENT: 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1.	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application for a continuation of an ex parte
injunction granted by Levine J on 30 December 1998. As
was explained and
accepted earlier, the injunction was expressed to be until further order but it
was accepted that the plaintiff
should bear the responsibility of establishing
today an entitlement for continuance of that injunction. It should further be
noted
that although no undertaking as to damages was given and, as I
understand, no undertaking was given or offered as to damages on 30
December
1998, the undertaking as to damages is now offered and will be given if an
injunction is ordered. I should say that the
Court of Appeal has recently said
that it is the responsibility of legal practitioners obtaining ex parte orders
to offer the undertaking
as to damages and not to leave it to the Judge in a
busy and difficult time of the year to remember to ask for it. 
<P>

2.	The substantive claim of the plaintiff under the summons is for orders that
the decision of the first defendant/administrator
as to the identity of the
creditors of the company and the amounts of the debts for which those creditors
are entitled to prove was
incorrect and should be set aside pursuant to
regulation 5.6.26 of the regulations made under the Corporations Law. 
<P>

3.	If the position as to creditors and value as contended for by the plaintiff
is found to be correct then it appears that a resolution
proposed by the
plaintiff's nominee at the first meeting of creditors, that Mr De Vries be
removed as administrator and Mr Graham
Butterell of Messrs Grant Thornton be
appointed in his place, would have been passed. Thus one of the orders sought
in the summons
by paragraph 6 is an order equivalent to the resolution which
failed. 
<P>

4.	Subject to whatever rights might or might not attach to some preference
shares it seems that the shares in the company are held
equally between the
plaintiff and the second defendant. It also appears from the evidence and what
has been said to me that it is
almost certainly in the interests of the parties
that the company, Fulager Pty Limited, be placed into liquidation. On the
evidence
as it stands before the court at the moment it is difficult to
understand the basis on which the directors could have formed the
opinion that
the company is likely to become insolvent. In fact, upon the evidence as it is
at the moment it is more likely that
this was a way to achieve distribution of
the company's assets. That, however, is a matter which would not appear to be
giving rise
to any prejudice to anybody and nothing further need be said about
the procedure adopted as the plaintiff does not challenge the
resolution of the
directors to place the company into administration but rather seeks to
challenge the particular administrator appointed
for the purpose of the
administration.
<P>

5.	The question then for decision is, whether or not there is a serious
question to be tried on the matter of whether or not the
liquidator was correct
when he admitted certain persons to vote as creditors in the amounts for which
their debts were admitted and
also, of course, whether or not his decision as
to the value of the plaintiff's debt was correct or whether that debt should
have
been admitted for a greater amount. On the evidence before the court it
seems that so far as the company records have been made available
to the
representative of the plaintiff, the third and fourth defendants were not shown
as creditors in any of those records and neither
were they shown in the
original list of creditors prepared by Mr De Vries.
<P>

6.	In the affidavit of Mr De Vries sworn 11 January 1999, he says that he has
amended the original list of known creditors but,
unfortunately, the amended
list annexed to his affidavit is precisely the same as the original list also
annexed to his affidavit.
I imagine that there is some mistake in this but
there is no additional evidence and I do not, therefore, know what the position
is.
<P>

7.	All that can be gained from this is the evidence of Miss Beckett that on the
documents inspected by her and on the original list
produced by the
administrator, the third and fourth defendants were not shown to be creditors
but they have now been admitted. As
the only other evidence is that the
administrator reported to the adjourned first meeting of creditors that after
consideration he
had decided that the third and fourth defendants should be
admitted as creditors; it seems that there is at least a proper question
to be
tried on this matter.
<P>

8.	The next question is whether or not the balance of convenience requires or
is for a continuation of the existing injunctive order.
It is not suggested
that it should be continued in its present terms but rather that the
administrator should be restrained from
taking any steps to dispose of the
assets of the company. The position at the present moment is that the second
meeting of creditors
will be held by 25 January. On that date the creditors
will either have to decide that the company should execute a deed of company
arrangement, or that the administration should end, or that the company should
be wound up. If the company is wound up then the administrator
will become the
liquidator.
<P>

9.	It is quite unlikely that there will be any deed of company arrangement. The
court does not know at this stage whether or not
the administrator will
continue to accept the third and fourth defendants as creditors at the next
meeting. The administrator noted
that their inclusion in the list was objected
to; he knows of these proceedings, and thus he may take some further steps to
determine
whether or not they should properly be included in the list of
creditors. 
<P>

10.	While it is not clear that the administrator is about to take some steps to
dispose of the company's properties he is certainly
taking steps to put himself
in the position under which they can readily be disposed of. I should add that
he is the one who has
resisted the restraint on his powers to dispose of those
assets. There is no reason whatever, as I understand it, for any requirement
for their early disposition and although there is no evidence which would
suggest that Mr De Vries is not an entirely proper person
to have the control
of the company at the present time, the fact is that he would not have that
control and the plaintiff's nominee
would have that control, if the plaintiff's
contention on the question of the creditors turns out to be correct. 
<P>

11.	In those circumstances, it seems to me that the appropriate course is to
extend the existing injunction until a short period
after the conclusion of the
second meeting of creditors. 
<P>

12.	Order that the first defendant as voluntary administrator of that company
be restrained: 
<P>

(a)	from entering into any contract for sale or lease of the properties of the
company and 
<P>

(b) 	from dealing with the cash deposit of the company other than to pay
creditors (excluding the plaintiff and the second, third
and fourth
defendants). 
<P>

	Costs reserved. 
<P>

	Liberty to restore on twenty four hours notice.
