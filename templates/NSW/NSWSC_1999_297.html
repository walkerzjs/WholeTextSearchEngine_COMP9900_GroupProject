<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 22 March 1999;  transcript edited on 1 April
1999)</b>
<P>

1	By Notice of Motion filed on 8 December 1998 the first defendant, Australian
Men's Health Pty Ltd, which was then the subject
of a deed of company
arrangement, applied for orders which would have given its administrator, Mr
Star, access to fund help by Mr
Madden.  Mr Madden had been appointed by the
Court as trustee of the Australian Men's Health Unit Trust to replace the first
defendant
and was subsequently appointed by the Court as receiver.  He had sold
the trust business and assets and the fund is the residue of
the proceeds of
sale less expenses.
<P>

2	On the first defendant's application I held that the application failed
because three obstacles to it had not been overcome. 
The first obstacle was
that the evidence did not identify any particular expenditure made or liability
incurred by the first defendant
as trustee, in a way which would enable me to
conclude that expenditure had actually been made or liability had actually been
incurred
by the first defendant in the proper performance of its duties as
trustee.  In the absence of evidence of that kind I was unable
to conclude that
the first defendant had the entitlement to indemnity out of trust assets on
which the application was based.  I
said the application seems to have been
based on a false assumption that it would be sufficient to show that funds were
needed to
enable the first defendant and Mr Star to defend other proceedings
(proceedings  4237/98) in which the competence of the administration
of the
first defendant has been challenged.
<P>

3	The second obstacle was an issue arising out of Mr Madden's report as
receiver, as to whether the first defendant's right as trustee
to an indemnity
out of trust assets would be available even if particular expenditure had been
identified.  The issue arose because
a significant part of the first
defendant's expenditure as trustee seemed, on the basis of Mr Madden's report,
to arise out of related
party transactions which might have been in breach of
the trust.
<P>

4	The third obstacle was, in my view, that the application was premature.  Mr
Madden had applied for directions as to whether he
should take further steps as
receiver and trustee.  The outcome of that application, which is still not
resolved, could affect the
destination of the remaining funds in his hands.
<P>

5	I also noted in my judgment of 17 December 1998 that in view of the purported
assignment of the first defendant's right of indemnity
to Mr Star as
administrator, the application may have been brought by the wrong party as the
applicant was the first defendant in
administration rather than Mr Star as
administrator.
<P>

6	I indicated in my reasons for judgment that I would hear submissions as to
costs but that I was disposed to order that costs should
follow the event in
the usual way. That would mean, of course, that the prospects for the
respondents to recover their costs of the
motion would depend on whether the
first defendant had any assets to meet those claims.  The evidence indicates
that it does not.
 Subsequently the first defendant has by resolution of
creditors terminated the deed of company arrangement.  By virtue of the
Corporations
Law and Regulations the first defendant is therefore in a
creditors' voluntary winding up and Mr Star is now the liquidator rather
than
administrator.
<P>

7	By Notice of Motion filed on 14 January 1999 pursuant to leave granted by the
Court, the plaintiff in proceedings 4905/97, namely,
Glazier Holdings Pty Ltd,
seeks orders with respect to the costs of the first defendant's unsuccessful
motion.  The orders sought
are in the alternative, that Mr Star personally pay
the plaintiff's costs as respondent to the Notice of Motion, or that the costs
payable in relation to the motion be deferred expenses for the purpose of s
556(1)(de) of the Corporations Law.
<P>

8	In support of its application the plaintiff refers to the dispute in
proceedings 4237/98.  Although the substantive relief sought
in those
proceedings appears now to be obsolete in view of the winding-up of the first
defendant, those proceedings remain alive
on the question of costs, the
plaintiff asserting that the costs of the present proceedings should be payable
by the second and third
defendants in the present proceedings.  Affidavits
filed in proceedings 4237/98 were read on the plaintiff's motion to recover
costs
from Mr Star or under s 556(1)(de) in order to prove the existence of the
plaintiff's assertions in proceedings 4237/98 rather than
to prove the truth of
those assertions.  It appears from that evidence that the plaintiff regards Mr
Star's administration of the
first defendant as highly deficient and in effect
negligent.  It also appears from the evidence that Mr Star and the first
defendant
would vigorously contest those allegations if they were pressed
against either of them, subject only to the availability of funds
to do so.

<P>

9	The plaintiff also refers to the long and complex history of the dispute
which has led to the 1997 and 1998 proceedings and the
various motions and
orders in them.  The dispute is essentially between the plaintiff and the
second, third and fifth defendants
in proceedings 4905/97.  It relates to the
business of the trust, which was the conduct of clinics to treat virility
problems in
men.  The plaintiff says Mr Star has not paid sufficient attention
to evidence which was available in the proceedings, including
the transcript of
evidence of the hearing before Young J on 18 March 1998 which should have led
Mr Star to make fuller and more thorough
investigations than he has evidently
made.
<P>

10	The plaintiff refers to s 76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r 4 of the
Supreme Court Rules and to cases such as <i>Knight v. F P Special Assets Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20174%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 174 CLR 178</a>, and says that I have jurisdiction to make an order
that Mr Star personally pay the costs of the first defendant's unsuccessful
application.
The plaintiff submits that while the first defendant's application
was not an abuse of process or made for a collateral purpose,
it was a totally
unfounded application.  The plaintiff says Mr Star purported to conduct the
application without authority for the
purposes of Pt 52A r 4(4)(f), and that he
commenced and carried on the application as the authorised director of a
corporation for
the purposes of Pt 52A r 4(4)(g).
<P>

11	It is not necessary for me to determine whether in an appropriate case these
rules would support an order that an administrator
personally pay the costs of
proceedings.  My view is that, assuming I have the power to make such an order,
this is not a proper
case for doing so.  Here the application by the first
defendant appears to have been brought in good faith.  The fact that I rejected
it does not, in my opinion, imply that it had no arguable foundation.  These
proceedings are of considerable complexity, visited
already by three Judges of
the Equity Division of this Court, and the application involves some difficult
questions of law as to
the trustee's right of indemnity and the
inter-relationship of that right with the rights and duties of an
administrator.  The application
also involves an assessment of a complex
financial report by Mr Madden.  Whether Mr Star might or should also have been
a party to
the application, in fact he was not, and no doubt that decision was
deliberate.  There was no application to strike out the motion
on the ground
that it was incompetent for the first defendant rather than Mr Star to make it.
Taking into account all of these considerations
I therefore decline to make an
order against Mr Star personally.
<P>

12	I turn to s 556(1)(de).  I do not intend to make any order interfering with
the statutory order of priority in s 556.  In my
opinion there is no good
ground for doing so, essentially for reasons of the kind already given.  This
is a complex case in which
an application was made in good faith by a company
in administration under a deed of company arrangement with little or no assets,
and the application was contested also in good faith by parties well aware of
all the relevant circumstances.
<P>

13	My declining to make an order altering the statutory order of priority
should not be taken to imply any particular view as to
the priorities which the
statute entails.  Section 556(1)(de) has the effect that in the winding-up of a
company, debts and claims
must be paid in a certain priority in which deferred
expenses appear as the ninth category in a list of priority expenses. 
<P>

14	`Deferred expenses' are defined in s 556(2) to mean expenses properly
incurred by a relevant authority in so far as they consist
of:
<P>

	(a) remuneration or fees for services payable to the relevant authority;
<P>

	(b) expenses incurred by the relevant authority in respect of the supply of
services, by (in effect) the partnership of which the
relevant authority is a
member or an employee of the relevant authority;
<P>

	(c) expenses incurred by the relevant authority in respect of the supply to
the relevant authority of services that it is reasonable
to expect could have
instead been supplied by the relevant authority or its partnership or
employee.
<P>

15	`Relevant authority' is defined in s 556(2) to include an administrator of
the company, even if the administration ended before
the winding-up began, and
an administrator of a deed of company arrangement executed by the company even
if the deed terminated before
the winding-up began.
<P>

16	It is clear that the costs incurred by the first defendant were incurred by
its administrator under the deed of company arrangement,
Mr Star, in the course
of the performance of his duties as such. The costs incurred included his own
costs of legal representation
and costs flowing from any order which I may make
that the first defendant pay the costs of the unsuccessful application. It
seems
to me, without expressing a final view, that it is plausible to contend
that costs of both of those kinds fall within par (b) or
(c) of the definition
of `deferred expenses' in s 556(2).
<P>

17	It therefore may well be that the liability of the first defendant in
liquidation to meet a costs order made against it in consequence
of the
unsuccessful application is wholly classified as deferred expenses, and
therefore has the level of priority allocated by s
556(1)(de), without the
Court making any orders to that effect.  
<P>

18	My conclusion therefore is that the plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed on 24
January 1999 is unsuccessful.
<P>

19	On the question of costs I propose to order that the plaintiff in the 1997
proceedings, which is also the applicant in the Notice
of Motion filed on 24
January 1999, should pay the first defendant's costs of that application.
<P>

	<i>(Submissions as to costs)</i>
<P>

20	While it is true that in the reasons for judgment which I have just
delivered I expressed the view that the decision by the first
defendant and Mr
Star that the application of 8 December 1998 be made by the first defendant and
not Mr Star was deliberate, I also
noted that there was no procedural
application to challenge the constitution of the application.  It is also true
that the application,
so far as it relates to s 556(1)(de), was brought on the
basis of an apprehension that if the order were not made the first defendant
might seek to claim its costs under s 556(1)(a) or (b).  However, the thrust of
my reasons for judgment is that I see no ground for
interfering with the
consequences which flow from the application of s 556.
<P>

21	The plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed on 24 January 1999 to which the first
defendant is the respondent is denied.  I order
that the plaintiff as applicant
pay the first defendant's costs of that motion.
