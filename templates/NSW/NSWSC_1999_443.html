<b>WOOD CJ at CL</b>
<P>

<b>WEDNESDAY 12 MAY 1999</b>
<P>

<center><b>HETHERINGTON v MIRVAC PTY LTD &amp; 3 ORS</b></center>
<P>


<P>

The plaintiff, a tiler, was injured when he fell through fibro sheeting onto a
concrete floor on a construction site on 10 November
1982. There was an
elaborate system of contracting and sub-contracting at the site.  The plaintiff
was an employer, director and
shareholder of a company (G &amp; S) which
contracted with Boral (the third defendant) to fix the roof tiling which Boral
had contracted
with Mirvac (the first defendant) to supply for the various
buildings on site.  The roof framework fibro sheeting was fixed by a
company
which had a subcontract for that work with another company, which was itself a
contractor to Mirvac for the carpentry work
on site.  This led to his first
solicitors, Taylor &amp; Scott (the second defendants), allegedly failing to
sue the persons who
were believed to have been the carpenters who had
physically fixed the roof framework, and fibro sheeting, or the owners of the
business
that did such work, within the limitation period.  The plaintiff
engaged another firm of solicitors (Keddies), who in turn allegedly
failed to
bring action against Taylor &amp; Scott in time.
<P>

The plaintiff sued the head contractor, Mirvac, in negligence and breach of
statutory duty. He sued the sub-contractor of the tiling
work, Boral, in
negligence, breach of statutory duty, and breach of implied terms of the tiling
contract that the roof would be safe
for the plaintiff to work on. He sued both
sets of solicitors, Taylor &amp; Scott and Keddies, for negligence, and for
breach of
an implied term of their retainer to exercise reasonable care and
skill.
<P>

<b>HELD</b> (finding for the defendants):
<P>

<b>Claim against Mirvac and Boral</b>
<P>

<u>Breach of statutory duty</u>
<P>

(1) 	The statute imposes obligations on persons <i>actually carrying out
building work</i>, whether personally or by servants or agents.  It could not
be said that either  Mirvac or Boral was actually carrying out the work.
 And
as an independent contractor, the plaintiff could not be characterised as a
servant or an agent of either Mirvac or Boral. 
The statutory duty rested on
the plaintiff's company, G&amp;S.
<P>

Formwork Pty Ltd v Civil &amp; Civic Ltd</i></b> (1982) SC (ACT) 1,
considered.
<P>

<u>Liability of Boral as an Employer</u>
<P>

(2) The plaintiff argued that he was an employee of Boral, as his company was
only created at Boral's request that all its sub-contractors
form proprietary
companies. This claim must fail. The plaintiff was an employer of G &amp; S,
which was an independent contractor;
 he was not an employee of Boral.
Circumstances pointing to this fact were: payments were made by Boral to the
plaintiff's company,
G&amp;S, without any taxation deductions; roof tilers were
expected to provide their own plant, equipment and trucks and to arrange
their
own insurance; G&amp;S paid for all labour and materials (except tiles); the
plaintiff declared himself as G&amp;S's employee
on tax returns; he was not
supervised and his work called for an application of trade skills; and there
was no suggestion that Boral
set working hours, or paid superannuation, long
service leave or sick leave.
<P>

	<b><i>Boral Roof Tiles Ltd v O'Brien </i></b>(NSWCA, 2 December 1994,
Unreported), <b><i>Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160
CLR 16</a>, followed.
<P>

(3) While the degree of control that a person who engages another can exercise
over the latter is important and sometimes decisive,
other considerations may
prevail.

(supra), considered. 
<P>

	
<P>

<u>Liability of Mirvac and Boral under a general duty of care</u>
<P>

(4) 	The general rule is that a principal is not liable for the negligent
conduct of his independent contractor. There are two exceptions:
where the
principal directly authorises the doing of the tortious act; and where the
principal engages the independent contractor
to perform a duty resting on him
and the independent contractor fails to perform it.

CLR 672</a>; <b><i>Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd</i></b> (supra),
cited.
<P>

	
<P>

(5) 	Had Mirvac or Boral been directly involved in the co-ordination or
supervision of the work, or had the work been carried out
by subcontractors in
close physical proximity, or had there been any suspicion that this roof
possessed any special risk, then liability
might have ensued. But here, the
trades followed one another, the roofing layout was identical to that elsewhere
used on the site,
the roof tiler was in a position to apply its own expertise,
and there was no reason to suppose that the various contractors were
other than
competent themselves to control their system of work without the supervision of
Mirvac or Boral.
<P>

	<b><i>Boral Roof Tiles Ltd v O'Brien (No2)</i></b> (NSWCA, 15 December 1994,
unreported) applied; <b><i>McArdle v Andmac Roofing Co</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20WLR%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 1 WLR

<P>

	
<P>

(6) 	The plaintiff was not in position of particular vulnerability, as was
understood to be an indication of the presence of a non-delegable
duty in
<i>Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris </i>(supra). Nor should either
defendant reasonably have been required to lay down and supervise systems of
work under which either the
carpenters carrying out the roofing work, or the
plaintiff, should carry out their work.
<P>

	
<P>

(7) 	Any obligation to provide a safe place or system of work, or suitable
plant and equipment rested directly on the plaintiff's
employer, G&amp;S.
<P>

	
<P>

(8) 	A degree of carelessness must be expected and catered for. However the
plaintiff here was a skilled tiler, and knew of dangers
of stepping onto
unsupported fibro. The simple truth is that he made a misjudgment for which he
should be regarded as solely responsible.
<P>

<u>Liability of Mirvac as occupier</u>
<P>

(9) 	The old rules defining the duty of an occupier have now been absorbed by
the ordinary rules of negligence.

<P>

(10) 	The plaintiff cannot gain any additional benefit by stating his claim in
terms of the duty owed by an occupier. Precisely
the same considerations that
operated in answer to his claim based on general common law duty of care, apply
here.
<P>

<u>Liability of Boral under implied term of contract</u>
<P>

(11) 	Boral's contract was with G&amp;S, not the plaintiff. In any event, the

<P>

	
<P>

(13) 	To establish negligence or breach of professional retainer sounding in

of value (here, the

<P>

	
<P>

(14) 	The plaintiff has not shown he had a cause of action against the
carpenters. Therefore nothing of value was lost through the
pleaded negligence
of Taylor &amp; Scott. For these reasons, there will be a verdict for Taylor
&amp; Scott, irrespective of whether
the Limitations defence was made good.
<P>

<b>Claim against Keddies</b>
<P>

(15) 	Having regard to the conclusion reached in relation to the claim against
Taylor &amp; Scott, this claim fails at the outset.

<P>

(16) 	.However the Court dealt with Taylor &amp; Scott's limitation defence,
that the limitation period for suing the carpenters
expired on 10 November
1988, and that any cause of action against Taylor &amp; Scott commenced to run
from that date, and expired
on 10 November 1994.

extinguish the cause of action once the initial time for commencing proceedings
has expired. However, if a
successful extension of time application is later
brought, then the earlier extinguishment is "annulled" and treated as though it
never happened.

<P>

<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>WOOD CJ at CL:</b> These proceedings came before the Court by
way of claims against the first and third defendants for damages for personal
injury;
  and by way of claims against the second and fourth defendants for
damages for professional negligence.
<P>

<b>THE PARTIES</b>
<P>

2  	The plaintiff was injured in an accident on 10 November 1982, at
the construction site for the Cotswold Retirement Village in
Bobbin Head Road,
North Turramurra.  The head contractor/developer for the construction of this
village, which comprised eighteen
residential buildings (known as cluster
buildings), a hostel, and associated works was the first defendant
("Mirvac").
<P>

3  	Mirvac subcontracted the carpentry work for the roof and ceiling
framing, including the fibro cement eave lining, to White River
Timber Company
Pty Ltd ("White River Timber").  That company provided the timber, fibro and
nails required for this work, and subcontracted
the labour to an entity trading
under the business name Collis Construction<b> </b>Company, of which the
registered proprietor, from 1 August 1982, was Dorgor Constructions Pty Limited
(Dorgor).  From 1 September
1983, Maului Construction Pty Limited was
registered as a co-proprietor of that business name.  The beneficial
owners/controllers
of those companies were respectively Gordon Collis and Louis
Manfredotti.  These two persons, along with some apprentices, were the
carpenters on site during the relevant period.
<P>

4  	Mirvac subcontracted the supply and fitting of the roof tiling to
the third defendant ("Boral"), the agreed successor to Clark
Tile Limited
(Clark Tile).  Boral subcontracted the fitting aspect of this work to G &amp; S
Roofing Pty Limited ("G &amp; S Roofing"),
a company formed and beneficially
owned by the plaintiff.  G &amp; S Roofing was allocated work by Boral on a
regular basis.  On
this site, it moved from one cluster building to the next,
when advised by the Mirvac site foreman that the next building was ready
for
roofing.  Boral, the plaintiff said, supervised his work in the sense of
ensuring that it met the specified quality requirements.
 Additionally, he
said, it resolved any problems on site, concerning shortage of tiles or
problems with the builder or other trades
that might hold up the roof
tiling.
<P>

5  	Consequent upon his accident, the plaintiff in January 1985
instructed his solicitors John Vaughan &amp; Company, to commence
proceedings
at common law for the recovery of damages.  Subsequently he withdrew his
instructions from that firm, and from about
October 1985 retained the second
defendants (Taylor &amp; Scott) to act as his solicitors.  A statement of claim
was filed in the
Supreme Court by Taylor &amp; Scott, on 10 November 1986,
naming as defendants Mirvac, Dogor (Sic) and Maului trading as Collis
Construction
Company, and Boral.  
<P>

6  	Dorgor and Maului were deregistered on and from 27 February 1992.
Prior to that date, on 26 February 1987 the solicitors for
those two companies
advised Taylor &amp; Scott by letter, that they were uninsured, and that the
insurance policy for the business
was issued in the name of Messrs Collis &amp;
Manfredotti.
<P>

7  	On 23 April 1993, Taylor &amp; Scott, on behalf of the plaintiff,
filed an "amended statement of claim," purporting to substitute
Messrs Collis
and Manfredotti for the two deregistered companies.  An application was made by
Notice of Motion, filed on 28 June
1993, for orders under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act
1969</a>, or alternatively under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a> Rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules, so as
to extend the limitation period, or to permit the joinder of those persons as
defendants
in place of their companies.  
<P>

8  	That application was dismissed by Master Malpass, on 16 November
1993, it being held that the case was not such as to warrant
an extension of
time under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 58(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>, or an amendment of the Statement of
Claim so as to correct any mistake in the names of the parties joined as second
defendants.
 
<P>

9  	Consideration seems not to have been given, at any stage, to
joining White River Timber as a party.  No complaint has, however,
been made in
these proceedings concerning any such omission.
<P>

10  	Thereafter, in about November 1993, the plaintiff retained the
fourth defendants (Keddies) to act as his solicitors.  They
filed a "further
amended statement of claim," on 20 December 1994.  By this document they joined
Taylor &amp; Scott  as second defendants,
in place of the parties formerly
joined as second defendants, upon the basis of their alleged negligence in not
joining Messrs Collis
and Manfredotti as defendants, within the relevant
limitation period.  
<P>

11  	Taylor &amp; Scott filed a defence alleging that this new claim
was itself statute barred.  An application for extension of
the limitation
period was filed on 24 March 1995, but was, on its return on 3rd April 1995,
stood over generally, after it was realised
that the provisions of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> for extension of the time to institute proceedings, were
inapplicable to actions for professional negligence of the kind
contemplated.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff again changed solicitors to a fourth firm, which
filed a "further further amended statement of claim", in which
Keddies was
joined as a fourth defendant, alleging that it was negligent in this instance
in not commencing proceedings against Taylor
&amp; Scott within time, and in
not retaining Dorgor and Maului as parties.
<P>

13  	During the course of the hearing, that began on Tuesday 2
February 1999, some sixteen years after the plaintiff's accident,
and some
twelve years after the plaintiff first attempted to initiate proceedings in
this Court, the current solicitors for the plaintiff,
who were the fifth firm
he had retained, sought and received leave to file a "third further amended
statement of claim" amending
the particulars of negligence against Taylor &amp;
Scott and Keddies.
<P>

14  	To the precise nature and content, in a legal sense, of the
relationships of those involved in the Cotswold project  I shall
return.
Before turning to those issues, however, I observe that the history of this
matter is disturbing, in so far as it has taken
fourteen years from the time
that the plaintiff first consulted a solicitor, for his case to come on for
hearing; in so far as the
plaintiff's interests appear to have been prejudiced
or delayed by inaction, and inconsistent advice by at least some of the lawyers
who have acted for him; and in so far as his case has come into the hands of
five firms of solicitors and at least eleven different
Counsel, including two
Queens Counsel.   It provides a regrettable example of the manner in which
personal injury litigation in this
Court should <i>not</i> be conducted.
<P>

<b>THE PERFORMANCE OF WORK BY THE PLAINTIFF ON THE COTSWOLD SITE</b>
<P>

15  	The plaintiff, who was born on 4 October 1953, began work as a
roof tiler in about 1974. Upon completing his apprenticeship
he became a
subcontractor to Clark Tile.  After Boral took over that business, it required
its subcontractors to form proprietary
companies.  It was at that stage that G
&amp; S Roofing  was formed by the plaintiff.  By the time that the Cotswold
Village project
got under way, the roof tiling work was physically performed by
the plaintiff, and by a person Tom Lloyd, whom the plaintiff described
as his
"partner".  He was not, however, a shareholder or director of G &amp; S
Roofing.
<P>

16  	No formal contract or correspondence capable of spelling out the
contractual relationship between the parties, either generally
or in relation
to the present job, was tendered.  It appears, however,  that Boral had
sufficient work to keep G &amp; S Roofing
fully occupied, either at the
Cotswolds site or elsewhere.  Progress payments were made by it to G &amp; S
Roofing, as and when the
work allocated to it was completed.  Such payments
were made weekly, subject to satisfactory inspection by Boral inspectors.  Work
was allocated to G &amp; S Roofing, by a Boral allocator Ron Thompson, or by a
Boral sales representative, John Henderson.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff said that after clearance, through the bank
account of G &amp; S Roofing, and payment of expenses , the monies
received
from Boral were divided equally between himself and his "partner".  I observe
that this is not the position reflected in
the tax returns, since the only
income recorded  in the plaintiff's personal returns for 1982 and 1983, were
his directors fees,
in the order of $5,000 (1982), and $6,000 (1983), whereas
in the company returns the Profit and Loss statements include an item
"subcontractors"
in the order of $16,000 (1982) and $35,000 (1983) and an item
for "wages" equal to the directors fees mentioned.  The plaintiff was
unable to
explain these records, save to state that he had left it to his accountant to
prepare returns reflecting  the true financial
position of himself and the
company.  The profit and loss statements of G &amp; S Roofing otherwise record
expenses of the kind that
might have been expected in relation to a company
trading as a roof tiler.
<P>

18  	While some obvious inferences might be drawn in relation to the
accuracy of these income tax returns, it is not necessary for
me to reach any
conclusion concerning the plaintiff's actual earnings before or after the
accident ,having regard to the way that
his damages claim was pursued,.  The
material is, however, relevant so far as it tends to show that G &amp; R
Roofing stood in a
subcontractor relationship with Boral, and that it was a
company of which the plaintiff was a shareholder and director, and from
which
he received as directors fees, or as a `subcontractor', the benefit of one half
of the progress payments made by Boral to it,
(after payment of all expenses).

<P>

19  	The legal nature of the relationship between Boral and the
plaintiff is in issue, and will be considered later in these reasons
for
judgment.   It is convenient to record, at this stage, however, that apart from
allocating work, Clark Tile and Boral issued,
at regular intervals, documents
addressed to "All Roof Tilers"   headed "Conditions of Work" which contained
various instructions,
of which that dated 20 February 1981, being the
instruction most nearly contemporaneous with the Cotswold Village job, is
typical.
 It stated:
<P>

"Tiler must -
<P>

- have Accident Insurance .
<P>

- Accept responsibility for workmanship.
<P>

- Accept responsibility for damage done by their people.
<P>

- Notify office immediately on completion of jobs.
<P>

- Weep-hole all top ridge.
<P>

- Nail second and then every third course, unless otherwise instructed
<P>

- Leave no broken or chipped tiles on roof.
<P>

- Use ridge-clips on first and last three (3) ridge on gable roofs.
<P>

- Cut nothing through roof.
<P>

- Sweep roof down and clean out gutters.
<P>

- Make roof watertight if you cannot ridge.
<P>

- Stringline first course to ensure straight and even courses.
<P>

- Keep ridge straight and even.
<P>

- Keep tiles straight and even.
<P>

- Keep bedding and pointing on gable ends straight, even and upright.
<P>

- Leave no holes in sarking.
<P>

- Minimum lap 76 mm.
<P>

- All pointing in Sydney sand only.
<P>

Each and every job will be thoroughly inspected before any payment is made.
<P>

We will guarantee to have cheques available for work completed in the correct
fashion by Wednesday noon of each week.
<P>

We also guarantee to hold payment for work not complete, payment for such work
will be held pending  a further inspection."
<P>

20  	Boral also issued a schedule of "contract rates" for all work
done, calculated upon a square metre basis.  At the conclusion
of the 1983
financial year, it forwarded to G &amp; S Roofing a Schedule of the gross
amounts paid to it as a "sub contractor" for
the year.  For each job Boral
provided, and delivered on site, the tiles required for the work at hand.   G
&amp; S Roofing was,
however, expected to provide the necessary tools,
equipment and subcontractors or labourers required to fix those tiles.  There
was
no reimbursement for any of these expenses.
<P>

<b>THE PLAINTIFF IS INJURED</b>
<P>

21  	The plaintiff commenced work on the Cotswolds site about 12
months before his accident.  He had carried out the roof tiling
on five other
cluster buildings at this site before moving on to cluster building 7.  Each
building was similar in the sense that
it was a two story building, with units
on the bottom floor, and on the upper floor.  Each unit had an external open
verandah, and
each building had three skillion roofs, pitched at the same angle
as the main roof.  The verandahs were accessible via sliding doors
from the
lounge room.
<P>

22  	The main roof for each building was supported by timber beams
and joists erected by Collis Construction Company.  The main
roof rafters,
which were fixed with 600 mm. centres, ran down to the brick wall between the
unit and the verandah.   They terminated
at a plate on the top of the wall.
The skillion roof over the verandah to each unit was supported by dummy
Canadian pine rafters,
(whose dimensions were 124 x38mm), which were in turn
supported by a cross beam running parallel to the outer wall of the unit. 
That
beam was set into, and supported by, masonry columns at each end of the
verandah.  The dummy rafters began at the outer side
of the plate previously
mentioned, and ran out to a fascia board at the end of the eaves.  
<P>

23  	The supporting timber work including the dummy rafters for the
skillion roof was also fixed by Collis Construction Company,
as was the fibro
eave sheeting that lay on top of those rafters.  The purpose of the fibro
sheeting was to provide a lining for the
verandah roof, and eaves.
<P>

24  	The dummy rafters, which also had 600mm centres, were offset in
relation to the main roof rafters at the main roof/terrace
interface.  The ends
of the abutting fibro sheets, whose dimensions were 2.4 metres x 1.2 metres,
rested upon the dummy rafters.
 They were normally secured at their ends, and
also down the line of the rafters by nails.  By reason of their width, each
fibro
sheet spanned, and was supported at its ends, and in the middle, by three
rafters. Once tiles were fitted, the fibro sheets were
retained in place by the
weight of the tiles.
<P>

25  	The roof drawings, which the plaintiff said he did not see,
clearly showed the offset of the dummy rafters.  The need for an
offset was,
itself, attributable to the aesthetic requirement of locating the rafters at
equidistant points between the masonry columns
located at the ends of the
verandahs.
<P>

26  	The plaintiff acknowledged that he was aware, from the lines and
marks that had been left on the fibro by the carpenters, that
the rafters must
have been offset on the other five Cotswold buildings on which he had carried
out roof tiling.  He had not seen
the actual rafters, but had relied on those
marks and nail lines for his footing, when working on those buildings.  He also
acknowledged
an awareness of the obvious danger of stepping onto fibro cement
sheeting, an inherently brittle material, other than at a point
where it had
direct support from underneath.
<P>

27  	He said that on other jobs, both elsewhere and on this site, it
had been his experience that the roof carpenters left their
work in a condition
where it was obvious through chalk or pencil marks placed upon the fibro
sheets, or through a line of nails,
where the roof rafters were to be found.
He also said that it was  normal practice for the ends of the fibro sheets to
be cut clean
at the point where the dummy rafters began, thereby exposing their
position for view.
<P>

28  	The plaintiff said that after being advised, by the Mirvac
foreman, that cluster building 7 was ready for roofing, he commenced
the work
of setting out the roof.  This work included placing sarking, and fixing the
battens to which the tiles would themselves
be later fixed.  He climbed a
ladder from the ground level that he rested against the fascia.  As he looked
down onto fibro sheeting
he saw neither pencil or chalk marks, or any line of
nails.  He also saw that the sheeting extended past the wall of the unit, and
up over the main roof rafters for a distance of about 600mm, thereby concealing
from view the plate, and the position at which the
dummy  rafters commenced.

<P>

29  	The plaintiff assumed from the absence of any indication to the
contrary that, in this instance, the rafters, supporting the
fibro, extended in
a direct line from the main roof rafters.  He placed his foot on the fibro
accordingly.  The rafters were in fact
offset, and his foot went through the
brittle fibro, causing him to fall through to the concrete floor of the
verandah some 3 metres
or so below, thereby sustaining the injuries that bring
about these proceedings.
<P>

30  	No evidence was called, save  as mentioned below, to show who
had actually carried out the work in fixing the fibro, or to
show to what
extent the fibro sheets had been nailed down.  In view of the limited time that
the plaintiff spent on the roof before
falling his evidence was, perhaps
understandably, somewhat imprecise in this regard.  He was, however, adamant
that the fibro had
not been nailed up the rafters.  It was his impression that
the sheets had been nailed only at the top and at the bottom.
<P>

31  	The only indication as to the possible identity of those who had
carried out this aspect of the work lies first in the assertion,
appearing in a
statement from Mr. Collis forming part of an expert report (received into
evidence in the case of Mirvac), to the
effect that there were 4 persons on
site (himself, Manfredotti, and two apprentices) and that he worked on each
roof.  Secondly,
it lies in a conversation, (admitted only in respect of the
claims against the second and fourth defendants), recounted by the plaintiff
as
occurring at the hospital when, according to him, Mr. Collis, in Mr.
Manfredotti's presence, said that he was "sorry, the boys
should have taken
more care when putting the fibro on the roof ... to get it ready for tiling
...".  In cross examination the plaintiff
gave a somewhat different version of
this conversation to the effect that it was Mr. Manfredotti who spoke, saying
"It's my son's
fault, he didn't mark the fibro or didn't nail it down", or
something along these lines.
<P>

32  	The plaintiff had not himself seen the carpentry and fibro
fixing being carried out on this building, and accordingly was not
in a
position to know who had physically performed the work, or for that matter
whether it had been handed over to Mirvac as complete.
 However, in the
statement signed by Gordon Collis, that forms part of the expert report
previously mentioned, that person said that
it was the practice, after the roof
framing work was completed by Collis Construction Company for any building, for
him to inform
the Mirvac foreman or leading hand, so that they could arrange
for a Council inspection, preparatory to the roof tilers commencing
their work.
In the course of this inspection, he said that the Council Inspectors would
check that "the collar ties, purlins etc
were completed and in accordance with
the plans".  Additionally, he said that they would check whether the fibro
sheeting was "correctly
secured".  
<P>

33  	No evidence was called to show whether this did, or did not
occur for cluster building 7.  Nor was it shown whether any relevant
documentation existed concerning  the hand over of the roof to G &amp; S
Roofing.
<P>

34  	As a result of his fall, the plaintiff sustained fractures of
the left transverse process of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae,
 a
compression fracture of the body of the 6th thoracic vertebra, a suspected
fracture of the left side of the 1st thoracic vertebra,
and avulsion fractures
of the spinous processes of  the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae.  He was
admitted to Hornsby District Hospital
where he came under the care of Dr.
Douglas, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon.  He was treated in hospital with a
surgical collar
and bed rest before being discharged ten days later with a
surgical corset. 
<P>

35  	He had some eight weeks off work before resuming his trade as a
roof tiler.  He was, however, left with neck pain, mid back
pain, a weakness in
his right arm and shoulder, winging of the right scapula, and headaches, which
have continued to the present
time.  By reason of these sequelae, and in
particular the weakness and pain in lifting, he gave up roof tiling in about
1988.
<P>

36  	He has since worked in real estate, and in the sale of building
and construction materials.  Currently he holds a position
as a business
development manager with Tyco.  He has tried on two occasions to return to roof
tiling, the first time following resignation
from his real estate job (1987)
when he attempted a full time return to work;  the second occasion being more
recent (1997),  when
he tried to carry out some casual weekend work to
supplement his normal salary.  Each attempt to return to work was unsuccessful
due to pain and weakness.  
<P>

37  	The plaintiff said that the pain in his neck and back continues,
and that he suffers severe headaches particularly  when  driving
 a motor
vehicle.  Following the accident he had physiotherapy for some time.  He treats
the headache with panadeine.  
<P>

38  	The problem in his shoulder has been investigated by his
treating doctors.  Its presence has consistently been confirmed and
reported,
upon examination, as involving some weakness and wasting of the muscles in the
right arm, particularly the deltoid, and
winging of the right scapula.
Electrical studies have shown denervation consistent with C5 radiculopathy, the
suggested  cause of
which is traction neuropraxia.  His headaches have been
described by Dr. Hodgkinson as being cervical/discogenic in origin.
<P>

39  	There is some minor conflict between the findings of the two
medical practitioners who most recently assessed the plaintiff.
 Dr. Pullemer,
who saw him in October 1998, found continuous restriction of cervical movement,
some limitation of abduction of the
right shoulder, some winging of the
scapula, some wasting of the shoulder girdle muscles, some hypoaesthesia in the
right thumb,
and some restriction of low back movement.  In his opinion the
plaintiff was not fit to return to any work placing stress on his
back or neck.
 He thought that the best advice for him was to avoid activities that
aggravated his symptoms. In his view the plaintiff
was likely to have ongoing
problems with his neck, his thoracic and lumbar spine, and also with his right
upper limb.  Surgery was
not however indicated.
<P>

40  	Dr.  Hodgkinson who also saw the plaintiff in October 1998,
found only limited loss of function in relation to his neck, shoulder
and arm.
The general prognosis he thought "reasonably satisfactory".   He did not
express any view about the plaintiff's  capacity
to undertake heavy physical
work,  a field of activity that he had previously ruled out, (eg in September
1989).   So far as he expressed
any other view (eg in December 1992) about the
plaintiff's capacity to continue in employment, that was confined to the
administrative
and clerical work that he was then carrying out.  His most
recent report is accordingly of only limited value.  
<P>

41  	The remaining medical reports tendered were more than six years
old and of little value, save so far as they all confirmed
an ongoing history
of tenderness in the thoracic, lumbar and cervical regions, winging of the
scapula and weakening of the right
arm.
<P>

42  	I see no reason not to accept the evidence which the plaintiff
gave of continuing pain in his mid back and neck;   of regular
headaches
related to the neck injury;  of weakness in the right arm and shoulder, and of
mild winging of the scapula,  all resulting
from injuries sustained  in the
fall.   His complaints are consistent with the report of Dr. Pullemer, which I
accept in preference
to the more general report of Dr. Hodgkinson.
<P>

43  	The sequelae described by the plaintiff and by Dr. Pullemer, do
not prevent him from continuing in the  clerical and sales
positions in which
he has now been working for some years.  I find that he is, however, unable to
return to heavy physical labour
whether on a full time or part time basis.
<P>

44  	The extent to which the plaintiff's enjoyment of life, and his
current capacity to engage in leisure activities, has been curtailed,
was left
unexplored.  I am accordingly unable to make any finding in this regard other
than to note that he suffers from headaches
on a regular basis, as well as pain
in the areas mentioned, that occasion him difficulty when exercising or sitting
too long.
<P>

45  	Similarly, no evidence was tendered in proof of any medical,
hospital or pharmaceutical expenses, or of any actual loss of
earnings to date.
Although the plaintiff said that he worked more slowly following his return to
roof tiling, no attempt was made
to quantify any loss in that regard.  I cannot
determine, upon the evidence tendered, whether his earnings in white collar
employment
since 1986, have or have not exceeded those that he would have
received had he carried on as a roof tiler.
<P>

46  	The only other evidence potentially capable of reflecting on any
economic loss claim was a vocational assessment report, tendered
in the defence
case, which tends to show that employment as a roof tiler  peaks in the age
group 20 - 24 years and declines steadily
thereafter, particularly after the
age of 40 years; that there have been cyclical periods of growth and decline in
employment within
the construction industry since 1981;  and that fluctuation
in the average wage rates of roof tilers over the period reflects demand
and
supply for labour at that level of employment. This evidence is of limited
value in any assessment of damages in this case, given
the absence of any
evidence of the plaintiff's earnings beyond 1983, save for his evidence that he
is currently earning $47,000 gross
and has the use of a company vehicle.
<P>

47  	Accepting these shortcomings in the evidence, the plaintiff does
not pursue any claim for past or future out of pocket expenses.
 Nor does he
pursue any claim for actual loss of past earnings, or for impairment of future
earning capacity, save by way of a buffer
for lost opportunity.  
<P>

<b>HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION</b>
<P>

48  	In order to deal with the claims which the plaintiff has brought
against Taylor &amp; Scott and Keddies, it is necessary to
supplement the
history given so far of the litigation.  Although no witness was called from
the five firms of solicitors, or from
the  Counsel, who have had some
responsibility for the case, extracts from the solicitors' files were tendered,
from which it is
possible to reconstruct the sequence of events.
<P>

49  	On 20 February 1984, David Carter of Counsel advised  the
plaintiff's solicitors, then John Vaughan &amp; Co, that Mirvac,
as general
contractor, owed a common law duty to all workmen on the site, as the
supervisor of that site, to provide a safe system
of work;   that it also owed
a statutory duty to those workmen under the Construction Safety Act 1912;  and
that he saw no advantage
in pursuing a claim against Collis Construction
Company, because they would probably join Mirvac, and because a breach of duty
on
its part would be "more possible to prove" than a claim of negligence
against the carpenters;
<P>

50  	In October 1985, Messrs Taylor &amp; Scott took over conduct of
the proceedings from John Vaughan &amp; Co.   The latter firm
rendered their
fees and disbursements in the sum of $1,718.
<P>

51  	On 1 April 1986, Messrs Taylor &amp; Scott briefed B. Solomon of
Counsel to draft a statement of claim and to advise generally
in the matter.
Counsel delivered a draft statement of claim on 1st July 1986, accompanied by
an advice explaining the basis on which
Mirvac, Collis Construction Company,
Boral Roof Tiles/Clark Roof Tiles, might be joined with appropriate advice as
to the need to
make business name or company searches, and other inquires, to
confirm that the correct parties were joined.  Counsel also advised,
contrary
to the opinion expressed by  previous counsel, that "due to the confusing fact
situation as to the relationship between
the parties, the safest procedure is
for all these defendants to be sued".
<P>

52  	On 10 November 1986, Taylor &amp; Scott filed a Statement of
Claim naming as defendants Mirvac, Dogor (sic) and Maului, and
Boral, but not
Messrs Collis and Manfredotti.
<P>

53  	On 12 November 1986, Taylor &amp; Scott wrote to Dorgor and
Maului, enclosing  a copy of the statement of claim, asking that
it be handed
to their insurer, and requesting details as to the name and address of that
insurer.
<P>

54  	On 26 February 1987, Dexter, Healy &amp; Co, Solicitors, replied
advising that they had been instructed by Manufacturer's Mutual
Insurance
Limited which had "issued a public liability policy to Messrs. Collis and
Manfredotti trading as Collis Construction Company",
and advising that the
entity sued was not that insured by their client.  The letter concluded "we are
attempting to clarify the insurance
situation and note that in the meantime you
will advise us before taking any further steps in the matter...."
<P>

55  	On 30 April 1987, John Sharpe of Counsel delivered an advice and
a statement under Part 33 Rule 8A that had been settled after
a conference with
the plaintiff.  In this advice Counsel recommended that an application be filed
in the Compensation Court against
Boral, claiming under S 6(3)(a) of the
Workers Compensation Act.  Counsel appropriately cautioned that the case raised
a "fundamental
question of law ... as to the safety of people include (sic)
subcontractors who attend on sites."
<P>

56  	On 1 June 1987, the Part 33 Rule 8A statement was filed, along
with a notice to set the matter down for trial.
<P>

57  	On 2 October 1987, a defence, along with cross claims against
Mirvac and Boral, was filed by Dorgor (but not by Maului).  
The defence
comprised a denial of all material allegations including the allegation that
the defendant  had been engaged in building
work on the site.
<P>

58  	At the state of Readiness hearing on 8 December 1987, the matter
was stood over to the general list.
<P>

59  	On 10 August 1988, Frisina &amp; Associates filed a notice of
intention to cease acting as solicitors for Dorgor.
<P>

60  	At a pre-trial conference, held on 1 June 1988, the matter was
struck out, for non appearance on behalf of the plaintiff, and
an order was
made for a new notice to set down for trial to be filed.
<P>

61  	A new notice of set down was filed on 7 February 1989.
<P>

62  	On 16 March 1989, an application for compensation was filed by
Taylor &amp; Scott on behalf of the plaintiff in the Compensation
Court,
seeking compensation from Boral as his employer, within the meaning of the
Workers Compensation Act 1926, S 6(3)(a).
<P>

63  	On 4 October 1989, this application was by consent struck out,
upon the basis of advice from Mr. Penny of Counsel, that the
"negligence
aspect" of the common law proceedings seemed "reasonably strong", and that the
client "did not wish to take any risk
in having any findings in the
Compensation Court adversely affect his common law proceedings."   In his
letter of advice, Counsel
observed that the "major tort feasors in the common
law proceedings would be the carpenter who constructed the roof ... and also
possibly the occupier, Mirvac".
<P>

64  	On 13 August 1990, an advice was given by Mr. Penny of Counsel
to the effect that the "carpenter would seem to be at primary
fault for the
accident;  but that in relation to Mirvac and Boral the claims were complicated
and depended upon who "was carrying
out the active building work on the site."
Counsel also noted that it appeared that the wrong second defendant had been
joined, and
suggested amendment of the statement of claim to add Messrs Collis
and Manfredotti trading as Collis Construction Company.  A recommendation
was
made to issue a subpoena for production of the relevant insurance policy and
also to take steps so that the name of Dorgor was
not struck from the register.
There was no response to this advice.
<P>

65  	On 21 January 1991, the solicitors for Boral wrote to Taylor
&amp; Scott advising of their instructions to apply to the Court
for an order
striking out the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution.
<P>

66  	On 27 February 1992, Dorgor and Maului were deregistered.
<P>

67  	On 29 September 1992, Taylor &amp; Scott wrote to the plaintiff
advising that the matter was to be included in the special
sittings of the
Court, to take place between 24 May 1993 and 4 June 1993, and inviting him to
attend for a conference to discuss
his case.
<P>

68  	On 15 December 1992, a letter was sent by Taylor &amp; Scott to
the Australian Securities Commission, asking for its confirmation
that the
Commission would not oppose the reinstatement of Dorgor and Maului.
<P>

69  	On 3 December 1992, Counsel appeared before a Registrar, at a
directions hearing for the Special Sittings, in the course of
which directions
were given for the  filing of an Amended Part 33 Rule 8A statement and for the
supply of relevant back up material.
<P>

70  	On 18 December 1992, the Australian Securities Commission wrote
to Taylor &amp; Scott advising of the procedure to be followed
to secure
reinstatement of the registration of Dorgor and Maului.
<P>

71  	On 8 February 1993, Mr. Penny settled a reply to an outstanding
request for particulars, and advised of several matters that
required
attention, including the collection of documents in support of the plaintiff's
claim for financial loss.  He emphasised
the importance of making immediate
investigations in relation to the insurance position of Dorgor, the party to
whom Counsel considered
negligence prima facie attached. In this advice,
Counsel expressed the view that it would be a lot harder to prove a case
against
Mirvac and Boral for "vicarious or supervisory type liability".  He
made it clear that a great deal of work had to be done on the
case very
quickly.
<P>

72  	On 23 April 1993, Taylor &amp; Scott filed an amended Statement
of Claim, without the leave of the Court or the consent of
the originally named
second defendants, purporting to substitute Messrs Collis and Manfredotti for
the two deregistered companies.
<P>

73  	On 29 April 1993, the schedule and other documents required for
hearings in the Special Sittings were filed in Court, at a
call over before the
Registrar, and Counsel appearing sent a memo to Taylor &amp; Scott suggesting
that a Notice of Motion to extend
the time for action against Messrs Collis and
Manfredotti be filed, returnable before the List Judge at the next mention on
12 May.
<P>

74  	At the call over that followed, the proceedings were struck out
of the Special Sittings, as not being ready for trial.  The
matter was placed
in the dormant list, and the newly named second defendants were given leave to
file a defence relying upon the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.
<P>

75  	The Notice of Motion was filed on 28 June 1993, and struck out
for non appearance of the parties upon its return date.
<P>

76  	The Motion was eventually relisted before Master Malpass on 9
November 1993 and dismissed by him on 16 November 1993, with
costs, (in the sum
of $6,062).
<P>

77  	The matter next came before Badgery-Parker J on 17 November
1993, when Counsel explained the potential conflict of interest
faced by Taylor
&amp; Scott arising out of the plaintiff's loss of ability to add Messrs Collis
&amp; Manfredotti, personally, as
parties.  His Honour made directions
requiring Taylor &amp; Scott to inform the plaintiff of the outcome of the
Motion, and to outline
the consequences, and his rights  concerning that
development, within seven days.  It was indicated that the matter would be
unable
to take its place in the forthcoming Special Sittings.
<P>

78  	On 24 November 1993, Keddies were instructed by the plaintiff to
take over conduct of the proceedings from Taylor &amp; Scott.
 The latter firm
rendered a memorandum of their fees and disbursements in the sum of $16,325.
<P>

79  	On 15 December 1993, the proceedings were stood over to the
dormant list.  The plaintiff was advised by Keddies that they were
of the
opinion that Taylor &amp; Scott should be joined as defendants, and that, to
that end, Counsel had been briefed to draft an
amended Statement of Claim.
<P>

80  	The draft amended Statement of Claim was settled in March 1994,
and sent that month by Keddies to the Solicitors for Mirvac
for endorsement of
their consent.
<P>

81  	On 5 April 1994, the Solicitors for Mirvac replied, advising of
amendments they suggested  should be made in relation to the
proposed Statement
of Claim.
<P>

82  	On 13 September 1994, a conference was held with Queens Counsel
and junior Counsel, which led to a further draft amended Statement
of Claim
being prepared, and circulated to Mirvac's solicitors for their consent.
<P>

83  	On 26 September 1994, Mr. T. Clarke of Counsel delivered an
advice to the effect that the best prospect  of establishing liability
was
again the carpenters and the co-ordinator of the work, that it was important to
avoid discontinuing against any party already
joined, and that it was necessary
to qualify an expert.
<P>

84  	On 19 October 1994, the amended Statement of Claim with the
consent of Mirvac's solicitors endorsed was received by Keddies.
<P>

85  	On 11 November 1994, the proposed amended Statement of Claim was
forwarded to Boral's solicitors for their consent, the document
being returned
four days later duly endorsed with that consent.
<P>

86  	On 9 December 1994, the amended Statement of Claim was forwarded
to the solicitors for the formerly named Second Defendants,
the document being
returned with a consent endorsement ten days later.
<P>

87  	On 12 December 1994, Keddies realised that the claim against
Taylor &amp; Scott might itself by now have become statute barred
 (i.e. upon
the assumption that the time for action had commenced to run from the time that
the claim against Messrs Collis &amp;
Manfredotti had become statute barred,
namely 10 November 1988).
<P>

88  	On 20 December 1994, the amended Statement of Claim was filed by
Keddies.
<P>

89  	In an inter office memorandum dated 24 February 1995, Mr.
Baraket, a partner of Keddies, noted that "we had exceeded the six
year
limitation period to sue Taylor &amp; Scott".  The memorandum further noted the
client was "getting anxious", and asked the
addressee of the memorandum of
"look after it, ring up the Law Cover solicitor and see if he can get it moving
again, and ring the
client and <i>just sedate</i> him."  Alternatively, it was
suggested that an attempt be made to  get the parties together to negotiate a
settlement.
<P>

90  	On 8 March 1995, Keddies rendered a memorandum of their  and
disbursements  in the sum of $6,596.20 to the plaintiff.  So far
as the file
shows the plaintiff was not informed, prior to this, of the new problem that
had potentially arisen.
<P>

91  	On 16 March 1995, Keddies wrote to the plaintiff advising that
Law Cover had advised that it intended to rely on the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> in answer
to the claim brought against Taylor &amp; Scott.    An explanation was given,
that was only partially  correct, along the
lines that in order for the amended
Statement of Claim  joining Taylor &amp; Scott, to have been filed, it needed
the consent of
the other parties.  The letter advised that Mr. Barakat had been
of the view that the cause of action had occurred on the date that
Master
Malpass had given his decision, so that the time for action would not expire
until 11 November 1996, but that the matter had
been discussed with Counsel.
The letter concluded by noting that this area of law was not clear and a Notice
of Motion and affidavits
were being prepared in order to get a decision from
the Supreme Court.
<P>

92  	An affidavit was settled by K. Rewell of Counsel, who advised
that a Notice of Motion should be filed, seeking an extension
of time to sue
Taylor &amp; Scott.  This Notice of Motion was filed and made returnable for 3
April 1995.
<P>

93  	The Solicitors for Taylor &amp; Scott, however, replied inviting
discontinuance of the application, for the reason that an
application for
extension of time to sue could only be made in the case of personal injury
claims.  The strength of this advice was
accepted, and on its return date the
Motion was stood over generally.
<P>

94  	On 18 April 1995, Mr. Hewitt of Counsel, who had now been
briefed in relation to the matter, advised that both Keddies and
he could not
longer act for the Plaintiff because of the conflict arising out of Keddies'
possible negligence.  It was his recommendation
that Keddies refer the
plaintiff to another firm of solicitors which practices "in the area of law
which this case will involve".
<P>

95  	Thereafter the matter passed into the hands, temporarily, of
Messrs Hunt &amp; Hunt, who obtained leave to file the further
amended
Statement of Claim (costs of the amendment being ordered in favour of the
defendants) and who, in August 1996, applied to
have the matter restored to the
list.
<P>

96  	Eventually, after some years in the holding list, during which
period the proceedings were from time to time called up, and
upon the
application of the parties, stood over, they finally came on for hearing, by
which point the plaintiff had again changed
his solicitors and Counsel.
<P>

97  	Finally, by way of a narrative of the facts, I note that a
memorandum dated 3 June 1993, and signed by Mr. Soden, the Chief
Executive
Officer and Principal Registrar of the Court at the time, was placed into
evidence.  It stated that a jury action (which
this was not) commenced in the
Common Law Division in January 1986, and set down for hearing in March or April
1986, would have come
on for hearing during mid 1990, and no later than the end
of 1990 "in the ordinary course of events".   The parties accepted, however,
for the purpose of this trial, that a hearing date in 1991 could have been
secured, in the ordinary course of events.  In the event
of any assessment
being required of the value of any loss of opportunity to sue the carpenters,
attributable to negligence on the
part of Taylor &amp; Scott, it was agreed
that it should be made by reference to a notional trial date during 1991.
<P>

<b>CLAIMS PURSUED BY PLAINTIFF</b>
<P>

<b>Claim against Mirvac</b>
<P>

98  	The plaintiff pursued his claim against Mirvac on the following
basis:
<P>

negligence arising out of the alleged breach of a duty of care owed by it, as
the developer/head contractor;
<P>

negligence arising out of the alleged breach of a duty of care owed by it as an
occupier;
<P>

breach of a statutory duty arising under the Construction Safety Act 1912, and
the Regulations made under that Act (in particular
Regulations 73(1)(2)(3)(16)
and (17) and Regulation 74(1)
<P>

<b>Claim against Boral</b>
<P>

99  	The plaintiff pursued his claim against Boral on the following
bases:
<P>

negligence the basis of the relevant duty of care not, however, being
particularised; 
<P>

breach of the same statutory duty asserted against Mirvac;  and
<P>

breach of terms implied into the contract between the plaintiff and Boral for
the roof tiling that the fixing of the fibro to the
rafters would be carried
out in a proper and workmanlike manner, that the roof would be safe for the
plaintiff to work on, and that
the fibro would be affixed to the rafters in
accordance with usual industry practice.
<P>

Claims against Taylor &amp; Scott  and Keddies
<P>

The plaintiff brings his claim against Taylor &amp; Scott for their alleged
failure to institute proceedings against Messrs Collis
and Manfredotti within
the time fixed by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>, and for their alleged failure to
prosecute the proceedings expeditiously, upon the following bases:
<P>

breach of the duty of care they owed in tort as solicitors;
<P>

breach of an implied term of their retainer to exercise reasonable care and
skill as his solicitors.
<P>

100  	An additional particular of breach upon which the plaintiff
seeks to rely depends upon the assumption that the purported filing
of the
amendment statement of claim on 23 April 1993, which named Messrs Collis and
Manfredotti as defendants in the place of their
corporations, constituted  a
discontinuance of the proceedings against those parties.  Otherwise, so far as
I can see no order was
made striking out that portion of the original statement
of claim;  nor was a notice of discontinuance ever filed.
<P>

101  	The plaintiff's claim against Keddies is pursued upon the basis
of similar duties arising in tort, and under an implied term
of their retainer,
in respect of their alleged failure to institute proceedings against Taylor and
Scott within the time permitted
by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.  So far as the
plaintiff's claim against Taylor and Scott is concerned, he does not concede
that the cause of action has been extinguished
by effluxion of time.  The claim
against Keddies is brought against the contingency that this might be held to
be the case, and that
by their delay in commencing proceedings, he has been
deprived of the opportunity of suing Taylor &amp; Scott for professional
negligence.
<P>

102  	Similarly to the claim against Taylor &amp; Scott, the
plaintiff relies upon an additional particular of negligence, that
assumes that
the filing, by Keddies of the further amendment Statement of Claim on 20
December 1994, acted as a discontinuance or
abandonment of the proceedings
against the two corporate defendants, Dorgor and Maului.   No attempt has ever
been made by Taylor
&amp; Scott, or by Keddies, or by the plaintiff's more
recent Solicitors,   to "resurrect" those companies, or to investigate whether
by appropriate proceedings, they might be brought within the insurance policy
taken out by Messrs. Collis and Manfredotti.
<P>

103  	I shall deal with these claims in turn.
<P>

<b>LIABILITY OF MIRVAC AND BORAL</b>
<P>

104  	The plaintiff's claims against these defendants may be
conveniently dealt with together.
<P>

<b>Breach of Statutory Duty</b>
<P>

105  	As the facts earlier recited show, Mirvac was the building
contractor on site.  It sub-contracted the roof tiling work to
Boral, and the
carpentry work to White River Timber.  Boral subcontracted the fixing of the
roof tiles to G &amp; S Roofing, of which
the plaintiff was an employee,
shareholder and director;  and White River Timber subcontracted the carpentry
work to Collis Construction
Company.
<P>

106  	Within that matrix of contractual relationships, I am of the
view that the decision in <u>HC Buckman and Son Pty Ltd v Flanagan</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20133%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974)
133 CLR 422</a> stands in the way of this aspect of the plaintiff's claim.  In that
case it was held that the regulations under the Scaffolding and
Lifts Act 1912
(NSW) imposed obligations on persons <i>actually carrying out</i> building
work, whether personally or by servants or persons whose acts are in law their
acts, but did not impose obligations on persons
who had subcontracted work to
independent contractors.
<P>

107  	As in <u>Buckman</u>, it could not be said here that either
Mirvac or Boral was actually carrying out the fixing of the roofing, either by
itself or by
its servants or agents.  Mirvac had contracted the two components
involved in that work (the erection of the timber framing and the
supply and
fixing of the tiles) to subcontractors.  Boral had nothing to do with the
erection of the roof framing, and while it supplied
the tiles it had contracted
their actual fixing to G &amp; S Roofing.
<P>

108  	The question to be asked, as was similarly asked in
<u>Buckman</u>, is whether either of the defendants was carrying out the
building work of roofing the units by an agent or agents.  The interpretation
placed on the regulation by Barwick CJ and by McTiernan and Stephen JJ in
<u>Buckman</u>, would require that question to be answered in the negative.
<P>

109  	Barwick CJ was unable to accept the argument that independent
contractors were the agents of the building owner or head contractor.
 His
Honour agreed with the majority in <u>Davey v Skinner</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20648" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) SR (NSW) 648</a>,
that the regulation there in question placed the obligation on the
<i>active</i> person, that is the one who carried out the work in actual fact.
"Building work" was so defined as to encompass each section of the
work being
done, so that the obligation to take the safety measures prescribed was imposed
"on the person carrying out <i>that</i> particular piece of work".   It was not
consistent with that conclusion, his Honour said, (at p 429):
<P>

"... to include independent contractors who are carrying out particular
building work as "agents" of the building owner or contractor
so as to impose
on him the obligation which clearly will fall upon the independent contractors
vis-a-vis the building work they are
actually doing."
<P>

110  	His Honour was unable to accept the view, expressed by the
majority in Davey v Skinner, that in some circumstances the expression
`servants or agents' could extend to independent contractors, but he did agree
with their view that:
<P>

"... `the use of the familiar phrase `servants or agents', from the subject
matter of the Regulations, is intended to embrace those
employed under a
contract for services, that is, not merely servants properly so called, but
also the agents, who, though not strictly
servants, the person carrying out the
building work employs to do for him what he has engaged to do', that is to say,
persons whose
acts are in the law the acts of a principal.  But this
description does not include independent contractors."
<P>

111  	The reasons expressed by Barwick CJ, with which Stephen J
agreed, and also by McTiernan J (at 433), wherein his Honour said
that:
<P>

"the relationship between an independent contractor and the person with whom he
contracts does not carry with it the legal consequence
of the relationship of
agency";
<P>

lead to the conclusion that Mirvac was not under any statutory duty in respect
of the roofing work. 
<P>

112  	The positon in relation to Boral is somewhat more complicated
given the context in which it dealt with the plaintiff.  Boral
certainly was
contractually responsible to Mirvac to provide the roof tiling, although not
the roof supports and associated carpentry.
 G &amp; S Roofing was the
subcontractor to Boral to fix the roof tiles.  In that sense its position was
at all fours with that of
the plaintiff respondent Flanagan in <u>Buckman</u>.
There the head contractor Buckman had subcontracted to one Shaw, the
fabrication and erection of the steelwork, and Shaw had subcontracted
the
erection of the steelwork to Flanagan.  By parity of reasoning, the majority
would have held that the statutory duty rested here
in G &amp; S roofing, and
not in Boral.
<P>

113  	The majority decision in <u>Buckman</u> has been consistently
applied, e.g. <u>Canberra Formwork Pty Ltd v Civil &amp; Civic Ltd</u> (1982)
SC (ACT)1, and I am bound by its authority.  Accordingly, so far as the
plaintiff's claim depends upon the alleged breach
by Mirvac or Boral of
regulations made under the Construction Safety Act, it fails in limine.
<P>

<b>Liability of Boral as an Employer</b>
<P>

114  	The plaintiff submitted that he was an employee of Boral.  In
this regard, it was submitted that G &amp; S Roofing was formed
only because
Boral requested it, and that its interpositioning did not alter the plaintiff's
status as an employee of the latter
company.
<P>

115  	A similar argument was considered in <u>Boral Roof Tiles
Limited v O'Brien</u>, (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Appeal, 2
December 1994 unreported) in relation to a truckdriver who was paid a wage
by a
family trust company to which Boral made payments for tiles delivered on its
behalf.  He had taken over a pre-existing arrangement
between another driver
and Clark Tiles (the predecessor to Boral) and in doing so had purchased that
driver's truck.  Approval was
needed and given for the purchase of the truck
and for the take over of the existing "contract".  Payments were made according
to
the number of tiles delivered, and the distance travelled.  The driver was
required to maintain the truck in good order, and to submit
it for inspection
if required.  The truck was painted in Boral colours with its slogan.  Loading
of the truck was carried out subject
to inspection by Boral staff, and there
were specific instructions as to the manner in which tiles were to be
unloaded.
<P>

116  	Payments were made by Boral without deduction for PAYE tax, but
from the time of the introduction of the Prescribed Payment
Tax System, (PPS
)which applies to self employed persons in particular industries, Boral made
PPS deductions from these payments.
 The plaintiff's family trust company made
deductions on account of PAYE tax in respect of payments made to him and his
wife.  It
also made payments for running costs, insurance, repairs and parts in
respect of the truck.  The only work which the plaintiff did
was in the
carriage of Boral products.
<P>

117  	It was noted that there was no suggestion that the
interpositioning of a family trust company was a sham, designed to conceal
a
different transaction, as that concept was discussed in <u>The Estate of
William Vicars deceased</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1944/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] NSWStRp 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281944%29%2045%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2085" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1944) 45 SR (NSW) 85.</a>  No argument along those
lines was advanced in the present case, and I see no reason for reaching any
different conclusion.
<P>

118  	It was held, allowing the appeal, that the relationship between
Boral and the plaintiff was not one of employer/employee,
and that the degree
of control reserved to, or exercised by Boral, was not decisive.  In that
regard it has become clear that while
the degree of direction and control that
a person who engages another can exercise over the latter is an important, and
sometimes
the decisive circumstance, other considerations may prevail.
<P>

119  	This was recognised in <u>Queensland Stations Pty Ltd v Federal
Commission of Taxation</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2070%20CLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 70 CLR 539</a>, where Dixon J (as he then was)
said, concerning the work relationship between a cattle drover and his
client:
<P>

120  	"There is, of course,  nothing to prevent a drover and his
client forming the relation of employee and employer:  see, for
example,
<u>Turnbull v Wieland</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281916%29%2033%20CLR%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1916) 33 CLR 143.</a>  But whether they do so must
depend on the facts.  In considering the facts it is a mistake to treat as
decisive a reservation of
control over the manner in which the droving is
performed and the cattle are handled.  For instance, in the present case the
circumstance
that the drover agrees to carry out al lawful instructions cannot
outweigh the countervailing considerations which are found in employment
by him
of servants of his own, the provision of horses, equipment, plant, rations, and
a remuneration at a rate per head delivered.
 That a reservation of a right to
direct or superintend the performance of a task cannot transform into a
contract of service what
in essence is an independent contract appears from
<u>Reedie v London and North Western Railway Co</u> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1849/824.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1849] EngR 824</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281849%29%204%20Exch%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1849) 4 Ex 244</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=154%20ER%201201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">154 ER

<P>

121  	Similarly, in <u>Stevens v</u> <u>Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty
Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 16</a>, Mason J said, at 24:
<P>

"...the existence of control, whilst significant, is not the sole criterion by
which to gauge whether a relationship is one of employment.
 The approach of
this Court has been to regard it merely as one of a number of indicia which
must be considered in the determination
of that question:  <u>Queensland
Stations Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation;</u> <u>Zuijs' Case</u>;
<u>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Barrett</u> (1973) 129 CLR at 401;
<u>Marshall v Whittaker's Building Supply Co</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20109%20CLR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 109 CLR 210</a> at 218.
Other relevant matters include, but are  not limited to, the mode of
remuneration, the provision and maintenance of equipment,
the obligation to
work, the hours of work and provision for holidays, the deduction of income tax
and the delegation of work by the
putative employee."
<P>

122  	Wilson and Dawson JJ said, at 35:
<P>

"The classic test for determining whether the relationship of master and
servant exists has been one of control, the answer depending
upon whether the
engagement subjects the person engaged to the command of the person engaging
him, not only as to what he shall do
in the course of his employment, but as to
how he shall do it:  <u>Performing Right Society Ltd v Mitchell and Booker
(Palais de Danse) Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281924%29%201%20KB%20762" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1924) 1 KB 762.</a>  The modern approach is, however, to
have regard to a variety of criteria."
<P>

123  	Their Honours added, at  36-37:
<P>

"In many, if not most cases it is still appropriate to apply the control test
in the first instance because it remains the surest
guide to whether a person
is contracting independently or serving as an employee.   That is not now a
sufficient or even an appropriate
test in its traditional form in all cases
because in modern conditions a person may exercise personal skills so as to
prevent control
over the manner of doing his work and yet nevertheless be a
servant:  <u>Montreal v Montreal Locomotive Works</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%201%20DLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 1 DLR 161</a> at 169.
This has led to the observation that it is the right to control rather than its
actual exercise which is the important thing
<u>(Zuijs v Wirth Bros Pty Ltd</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1955/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2093%20CLR%20561" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 93 CLR 561</a> at 571)  but in some circumstances it may even be a mistake
to treat as decisive a reservation of control over the manner in which
work is
performed for another."
<P>

124  	The other indicia of the nature of the relationship that they
identified as relevant were as follows:
<P>

"Those suggesting a contract of service rather than a contract for services
include the right to have a particular person do the
work, the right to suspend
or dismiss the person engaged, the right to the exclusive services of the
person engaged and the right
to dictate the place of work, hours of work and
the like.  Those which indicate a contract for services include work involving
a
profession, trade or distinct calling on the part of the person engaged, the
provision by him of his own place of work or of his
own equipment, the creation
by him of goodwill or saleable assets in the course of his work, the payment by
him from his remuneration
of business expenses of any significant proportion
and the payment to him of remuneration without deduction for income tax."
<P>

125  	In the present case, there was no direct control over the
performance of roof tiling by the plaintiff.  He was obliged to
complete the
work to certain requirements, but that is no different from any contract for
services whereunder the party requesting
the services specifies a certain
quality of finish.  Of considerable significance in the present case are the
circumstances that
payments for work performed were made by Boral to G &amp; S
Roofing without any deduction on account of taxation;  that roof tilers
were
expected to provide and maintain their own trucks, plant and equipment and to
arrange their own insurance;  that G &amp; S Roofing
paid for all labour and
materials (other than tiles) used on Boral jobs;  that the plaintiff in his
income tax returns declared himself
to be an employee of G &amp; S Roofing;
that payments were made by Boral according to the area of tiles fixed; that the
work performed
by the plaintiff called for an application of trade skills;  and
that he was not supervised on a daily or even an intermittent basis.
 Moreover,
there was no suggestion that Boral set the hours of work, or made any payments
towards superannuation, long service leave,
or sick leave.
<P>

126  	These considerations are decisive.  I am unable to conclude
that the plaintiff was an employee of Boral, and so far as his
claim is based
upon the proposition that Boral owed him a duty of care as his employer it must
fail.
<P>

<b>Liability of Mirvac and Boral under a general duty of care</b>
<P>

127  	It was next submitted that Mirvac and Boral owed a general
common law duty of care to the plaintiff, in accordance with the
principles
discussed in <u>Brodribb</u>.  Each was said to have been in breach of this
duty in failing to warn the plaintiff of the dangers to which he was exposed;
in failing
to provide proper and safe equipment plant, tackle and appliances;
in failing to provide a safe place of work; in permitting the
plaintiff to
carry out the job of roofing when it was not safe to do so; in permitting fibro
to be positioned beyond the wall plate
and to sit on dummy rafters that were
offset from the column rafters; and in failing to warn the plaintiff that the
fibro sheets
were not nailed to the rafters or to ensure that those sheets were
nailed to each rafter in a safe and proper method.   
<P>

128  	So far as these particulars relate to fault directly
attributable to Mirvac, or to Boral they depend upon there having been
a
personal duty of care reposed in them to exercise reasonable care to protect
the plaintiff from foreseeable risk of injury, which
called upon them to ensure
that his place of work was safe, to provide him with proper plant and
equipment, and to ensure that the
roofing contractors carried out their work in
a particular way.  So far as any unsafe condition was attributable to the act
of an
independent contractor, they depend upon the duty owed by the defendants
being non delegable.
<P>

129  	It was no part of the plaintiff's case that either Mirvac or
Boral was negligent in the engagement of a subcontractor who
was either
unqualified or incompetent.  Nor was there any specific allegation that either
had failed to exercise reasonable care
in co-ordinating the activities of the
sub-contractors.
<P>

130  	It may be accepted that a risk of injury attaches in respect of
any person who has to go on to a roof structure, erected by
another, in order
to carry out or complete building work in respect of that structure.
Necessarily that follows from the circumstance
that such a person is expected
to work at a height, and upon a structure for the security and soundness of
which he has to rely upon
the other contractor.
<P>

131  	It may also be accepted that it would have been foreseeable by
each of Mirvac and Boral that a tiler, in the position of the
plaintiff,  would
have had to go on to such a roof structure on this construction site and that a
risk of injury would attach to
such activity, if the roof structure was not
sound, or if the areas upon which he could safely walk were not readily
apparent or
discoverable. 
<P>

132  	Is this enough to attract a general common law duty of care, on
the part of Mirvac or Boral vis a vis the plaintiff, or liability
on their
part, if his injury was occasioned as the result of the negligence of a
subcontractor to either of them?
<P>

133  	It has long been a general rule that a principal is not liable
for the negligent conduct of his independent contractor, or
for the independent
act of a third party:  <u>Smith v Lewis</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1945] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2070%20CLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1945) 70 CLR 256</a> at 261-2;  <u>

691-2.  
<P>

134  	To that general rule there are two apparent exceptions:  the
first, when the principal directly authorises the doing of the
act which
amounts to the tort;  the second, when the principal engages the independent
contractor to perform a duty resting on him
and the independent contractor
fails to perform it.
<P>

135  	Each of Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ in <u>Brodribb</u>
rejected the notion that there is a further exception, under Australia law, to
this general rule, based upon the circumstance that
the activities in which the
independent contractor was engaged were extra hazardous.
<P>

136  	In <u>Brodribb,</u> the Court was concerned with an operation
involving the felling, snigging, and removal by truck of felled timber to a
sawmill operated
by Brodribb.  That company engaged three classes of
independent contractors: tree fellers, sniggers and truckers.  The logging
operations
were overseen by a bush boss employed by Brodribb.  A trucker
Stevens, was injured as the result of a casual act of negligence of
a snigger
while loading a log onto his truck.  It was held by the whole Court that
<u>Brodribb</u> owed a general common law duty of care to the trucker but
(Deane J dissenting) it was not in breach of that duty.  Mason J said,
at
30-31:
<P>

"While individual fellers, sniggers and truckdrivers may have been responsible
for their own safety with regard to carrying out
their own functions, they had
little choice but to rely on the care and skill of Brodribb in the arrangements
which it made for the
disposition of the work, and on the care and skill of the
persons engaged by Brodribb in the execution of the work.  
<P>

137  	The interdependence of the activities carried out in the
forest, the need for co-ordination by Brodribb of those activities
and the
distinct risk of personal injury to those engaged in the operations called for
the prescription and provision of a safe system
by Brodribb.  Omission to
prescribe and provide such a system would expose the workers to an obvious risk
of injury.  Although the
obligation to provide a safe system of work has been
regarded as one attaching to an employer, there is no reason why it should be
so confined.  If an entrepreneur engages independent contractors to do work
which might as readily be done by employees in circumstances
<i>where there is
a risk to them of injury arising from the nature of the work and where there is
a need for him to give directions as
to when and where the work is to be done
and to co-ordinate the various activities</i>, he has an obligation to
prescribe a safe system of work.  The fact that they are not employees, or that
he does not retain a right
to control them in the manner in which they carry
out their work, should not affect the existence of an obligation to prescribe a
safe system."
<P>

138  	In considering whether this duty was a personal, non delegable
duty, his Honour observed: (32/33)
<P>

"In <u>Kondis v State Transport Authority</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 672</a>, I considered
that the law sometimes imposes on people a duty higher than the usual common
law duty to take reasonable care.  This
higher duty is a duty to ensure that
reasonable care is taken and it is said to be non-delegable because a principal
who engages
another to perform work will be liable for the negligence of the
person so engaged, notwithstanding that he exercised reasonable
care in the
selection of the contractor".  
<P>

139  	<u>Kondis</u> was, however, distinguished by his Honour upon
the basis that there was "not the requisite relationship between the parties
such
as would be required to impute liability to Brodribb for the casual act of
negligence" found on the part of the snigger.  The difference
lay in the
circumstance that in <u>Kondis</u> `the crane driver assumed the control or
supervision of the labourer who was injured, control or supervision which was
ordinarily
exercised by the employer';  whereas here the snigger "had not in
any sense assumed control or supervision" of the injured driver.
 Moreover,
Brodribb "did not exercise control of, or retain a right to control or
supervise, the loading operation" in which the
plaintiff was injured.
<P>

140  	Wilson and Dawson JJ, (at 43 to 44), noted the existence of
exceptions or qualifications to the general rule laid down in
<u>Quarman v
Burnett</u> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1840/182.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1840] EngR 182</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281840%29%206%20M%20%26%20W%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1840) 6 M &amp; W 499</a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=151%20ER%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(151 ER 509)</a> that a person is not liable for
the acts or omissions of another, unless that other is his servant acting in
the course of his employment,
and hence is not liable for the acts or omissions
of a competent independent contractor employed by him. 
<P>

141  	Although their Honours assumed that <u>Brodribb </u>owed to the
injured worker a duty of care, "arising from the general supervisory functions"
it exercised in its licence area, that
duty they suggested might be qualified
in the sense that:
<P>

"...it seems to us that the extent of the duty would have to take account of
the independent functions of the contractors and be
something less than that
owed by an employer to his employees.  To equate the duty with that owed by an
employer to his employees
would be to give no weight to the very circumstance
which differentiates the contractors from employees."
<P>

142  	They defined the duty in the following terms: (at 45/46)
<P>

"Any such duty was, in effect, a duty to exercise care in the co-ordination of
the activities of the various contractors".  
<P>

143  	Brennan J, at 47/48, described the duty arising in the
circumstances outlined, as follows:
<P>

"An entrepreneur who organises an activity involving a risk of injury to those
engaged in it is under a duty to use reasonable care
in organising the activity
to avoid or minimise that risk, and that duty is imposed whether or not the
entrepreneur is under a further
duty of care to servants employed by him to
carry out that activity.  The entrepreneur's duty arises simply because he is
creating
the risk (<u>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 424</a>
at 479) and his duty is more limited than the duty owed by an employer to an
employee.  The duty to use reasonable care in organising
an activity does not
import a duty to avoid any risk of injury;  it imports a duty to use reasonable
care to avoid unnecessary risks
of injury and to minimise other risks of
injury.  <i>It does not import a duty to retain control of working systems if
it is reasonable to engage the services of independent contractors
who are
competent themselves to control their system of work without supervision by the
entrepreneur</i>.  The circumstances may make it necessary for the entrepreneur
to retain and exercise a supervisory power or to prescribe the respective
areas
of responsibility of independent contractors if confusion about those areas
involves a risk of injury. But once the activity
has been organised and its
operation is in the hands of independent contractors, liability for negligence
by them within the area
of their responsibility is not borne vicariously by the
entrepreneur.  If there is no failure to take reasonable care in the employment
of independent contractors competent to control their own systems of work, or
in not retaining a supervisory power or in leaving
undefined the contractors'
respective areas of responsibility, the entrepreneur is not liable for damage
caused merely by a negligent
failure of an independent contractor to adopt or
follow a safe system of work either within his area of responsibility or in an
area
of shared responsibility."
<P>

144  	In deciding that there was no negligence by Brodribb, his
Honour said, inter alia, at 48/49:
<P>

"Apart from its responsibility in the organising of the loading of logs, did
Brodribb have any relevant continuing responsibility
in the conduct of the
loading operations?  I think not.  If the persons working in the vicinity of
the loading ramps had been employees,
Brodribb would have remained under a
continuing duty to prescribe and enforce a safe system for dealing with the
problem of logs
jammed on or near the ramp (see <u>Kondis v State Transport
Authority</u>) but Brodribb was not under such a duty to persons who were not
employees."
<P>

145  	His Honour otherwise agreed with Mason J, that no special
category of non-delegable duty of care arose from the circumstances
of that
case.
<P>

146  	The decision in <u>Boral Roof Tiles Limited v O'Brien</u> (No2)
(Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal, 15 December 1994 unreported)
has some relevance.  The plaintiff, for the
reasons earlier noted (paras
116-119 above) was there treated as an employee, not of Boral but of Lasmine
Pty Ltd, the company which
had contracted with Boral to deliver tiles to
building sites.  He was injured while manually unloading tiles from a truck, at
one
such site.  Boral had required that its tiles be unloaded manually, and
Lasmine had contracted with it on that basis. 
<P>

147  	Sheller JA, with whom Handley and Powell JJA agreed,
distinguished <u>Brodribb </u>upon the basis that, the plaintiff subcontractor
in that case was "working in close physical proximity with other
subcontractors,
in an area under the control of the sawmiller and in a manner
organised by" it.  In the present case, Lasmine was under contract
to provide
Boral with a carrying service, and as employer of the plaintiff, it owed to him
the complex of duties that arise in relationships
of employment.  His Honour
said:
<P>

"Those duties would not ordinarily shift from the employer to a third party
which had engaged the employer to provide a service.
 If the employer agrees to
provide that service and uses its employees to perform it , it is for the
employer to ensure that performance
does not involve any breach of the duties
it owes its employees."
<P>

148  	His Honour recognised that: 
<P>

"In circumstances such as were proved in <u>Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co
Pty Ltd</u> the third party contracting with the employer may also owe duties
to persons carrying out work for the third party regardless of
whether they are
independent contractors or the employees of independent contractors."
<P>

149  	The present was however not such a case, since as his Honour
observed:
<P>

"The system of work adopted was that of Lasmine.  It had contracted to unload
the tiles by hand.  If a party contracts to perform
a service in a particular
way I can see no basis upon which the party, with which it contracts, can be
held responsible in negligence
for injury done to the employees of the first
party in performing that service, absent some undisclosed and unexpected
hazard.  In
my opinion there is nothing n <u>Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co
Pty Ltd</u> which detracts from this general proposition." (p6)
<P>

150  	The decision in <u>O'Brien</u> is of relevance in so far as it
emphasises the need for a supervisory element, on the part of the entity
contracting out the work,
to attract liability for an unsafe condition, whether
it be a system or place of work, brought about by an independent contractor.

<P>

151  	<u>McArdle v Andmac Roofing Company</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%201%20WLR%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 1 WLR 356</a> is
also of relevance.  There a plaintiff was employed to carry out work on a
construction site by Andmac, one of two subcontractors
to the principal
contractor (Pontin).  The subcontractors were working together, under the
control of Pontin's engineer.  The principal
contractor was held to have been
negligent when the plaintiff fell down an opening in the roof that had been
made by the other subcontractor
(Newton), and left unguarded and unfenced when
the employees of that subcontractor had knocked off work.  The liability of the
principal
contractor arose because it had been directly concerned with the work
in hand, and having employed contractors without parting with
the overriding
responsibility, it had failed to make express provision with the subcontractors
as to who was to ensure that safety
precautions were taken for men working
together in close proximity in circumstances of obvious danger.
<P>

152  	Sellers LJ at 361, noted that co-ordination, where there are
multiple trades and varying activities on the one site, seemed
essential for
safety, and said that the responsibility for it will normally fall on the main
contractor, who can allocate work and
responsibility between the
subcontractors.   As his Lordship observed at 363:
<P>

"In a practical sense (the principal contractor) was conducting and organising
the operations ... Under the conditions which changed
as the work progressed
there arose a continuing duty on all the defendants to take reasonable care
that those who might be expected
to be in the vicinity of the danger, (none
more obviously so than the plaintiff) were not confronted with unnecessary
risks."   
<P>

153  	The nature of the work arrangements was also important for
Davies LJ, who said, at 365:
<P>

"As I see it, there was here a common law duty on Pontin, who were employing
two firms of subcontractors on a task which inevitably
involved that they
should work in close proximity to each other and in close proximity to this
dangerous hole in the roof, to take
steps, or to see that Andmac and Newton
took steps - reasonable steps in each case - to prevent the workmen from coming
to harm."
<P>

154  	It was similarly important for Edmund Davis LJ, who at 369
said:
<P>

"Never losing sight of the fact that Newton were independent contractors and
not the servants or agents of Pontin, the roof work
that the former were
engaged to perform was such as could well involve danger to others who, to the
knowledge of Pontin, would be
working in close proximity to the joiners -
danger, that is, unless proper safety precautions were taken.  Had Newton's men
been
in the direct employment of Pontin there could be no doubt as to the
liability of the latter.  Having regard to all the circumstances
does the fact
that Newton were independent contractors relieve Pontin of all responsibility?
In my judgment, it does not."
<P>

155  	I turn next, to <u>Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty
Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 520</a>, where Mason CJ and Deane, Dawson, Toohey &amp;
Gaudron JJ said, in relation to the non delegable duty of care that may, in
appropriate
circumstances, attach to a principal who engages an independent
contractor (at 550-551):
<P>

"It has long been recognised that there are certain categories of case in which
a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable
risk of injury to another
will not be discharged merely by the employment of a qualified and ostensibly
competent independent contractor.
 In those categories of case, the nature of
the relationship of proximity gives rise to a duty of care of a special and
`more stringent'
kind, namely a `duty to ensure that reasonable care is taken'.
(<u>Kondis v State Transport Authority</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 672</a> at 686)  Put
differently, the requirement of reasonable care in those categories of case
extends to seeing that care is taken."
<P>

...
<P>

"In Kondis (1984) 154 CLR at 679-687 in a judgement with which Deane J and
Dawson J agreed, Mason J identified some of the principal
categories of case in
which the duty to take reasonable care under the ordinary law of negligence is
non-delegable in that sense:
  adjoining owners of land in relation to work
threatening support or common walls;  master and servant in relation to a safe
system
of work;  hospital and patient;  school authority and pupil;   and
(arguably) occupier and invitee.  In most, though conceivably
not all, of such
categories of case, the common `element in the relationship between the parties
which generates (the) special responsibility
or duty to see that care is taken'
is that `<i>the person on whom (the duty) is imposed has undertaken the
care</i>, <i>supervision or control</i> of the person or property of another or
is so placed in relation to that person or his property as to assume a
particular responsibility
for his or its safety, in circumstances where the
person affected might reasonably expect that due care will be exercised'. (at
687)
 It will be convenient to refer to that common element as `the central
element of control'.  Viewed from the perspective of the person
to whom the
duty is owed, the <i>relationship of proximity giving rise to the non delegable
duty of care in such cases is marked by special dependence or vulnerability</i>
on the part of that person. (The Commonwealth v Introvigne  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 258</a>
at 271, per Mason J).
<P>

156  	Brennan J, who dissented on the facts, described the relevant
principal as follows, (at 578-579:
<P>

"... when an act done by an independent contractor and authorised by the
employer creates or increases the risk of injury to a third
party, the employer
who authorises the act brings himself into such a relationship with the third
party that he is bound to take
reasonable care to prevent the occurrence of
that injury (<u>Sutherland Shire  Council v Heyman</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 424</a> at
479)  The duty is personal and, if it is not performed, the employer is
responsible.  In practice, the act which gives rise to
a duty in the employer
to take reasonable care will be one which, in the natural course of things,
involves the risk of injurious
consequences to a third party.  In that sense,
the act will be naturally `dangerous'."
<P>

and
<P>

"... the work done by an independent contractor on an employer's premises will
impose on the employer a duty to take reasonable
care to avoid its injurious
consequences on a neighbour's premises only if the work naturally involves a
risk of those consequences.
 Where injurious consequences flow from the
negligent manner in which an independent contractor does an authorised act and
not from
the nature of the act which was authorised, the employer is not
liable."
<P>

157  	In <u>Northern Sandblasting Pty Ltd v Harris</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20188%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 188 CLR
313</a> the High Court returned to the difficult question whether the circumstances
of a given case are such as to give rise to a duty that
is discharged by the
selection of a competent independent contractor to undertake a particular task,
and the circumstances which
give rise to a duty that can be discharged only by
the non-negligent performance of that task.  
<P>

158  	The extent of the difficulty involved in the application of the
principles outlined above to any particular case is indicated
by the fact that,
in this case, the High Court divided by four Justices, (Brennan CJ, Toohey,
Gaudron and McHugh JJ) to three Justices,
(Dawson, Gummow and Kirby JJ) in
finding the defendant landlord liable, for a breach of the duty of care it owed
to a child who was
electrocuted as the result of deficiencies in the electrical
system of the house, which her parents had leased.  The problem arose
by reason
of the negligence of an electrical contractor who had been engaged, at an
earlier date by the landlord, to carry out repairs
to an electric stove.  The
existence of a duty to take reasonable care for the plaintiff was conceded, the
issue being confined to
the question whether the landlord was in breach of
it.
<P>

159  	The majority came to their decision on that issue, by different
routes.  They were not of the same mind as to whether the
case was one where
the landlord owed a non delegable duty of care which had not been discharged by
the engagement of the contractor.
 In fact, only Toohey and McHugh JJ so held;
Brennan CJ, Dawson, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ all being of the view that the
duty
of care, owed in relation to the repair of the stove, had been discharged
by the engagement of a qualified contractor, whose competence
the landlord had
no reason to doubt.  
<P>

160  	Toohey J founded his conclusion on this aspect of the case, on
the ground of the combination of the "central element of control",
in the
landlord, and of a "special dependence or vulnerability" on the part of the
child (at 353).  McHugh J rested his decision
on the simple circumstance that,
in undertaking to have the stove repaired, the landlord owed the members of the
household a personal
non delegable duty of care of which the contractor's
negligence had caused it to be in breach.   
<P>

161  	Brennan CJ said, (at 331-332):
<P>

"The question whether a defendant who employs an independent contractor to
perform a given task is liable as for a breach of the
defendant's own duty in
the event of negligence on the part of the independent contractor in performing
the task is not answered
by pointing to the independent contractor's negligence
(see <u>The Commonwealth v Introvigne </u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 258</a> at 279).  The
independent contractor's negligence is material only in showing the non
discharge of any duty that may have been imposed
on the defendant.  The basic
question is whether any and what personal duty was imposed upon the defendant
in the circumstances of
the case. Apart from well-established relationships
that give rise to non-delegable duties (<u>Kondis v State Transport
Authority</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 672</a> at 685-687) it is not easy to distinguish
between the circumstances which give rise to a duty that is discharged by the
selection
of a competent independent contractor to undertake a particular task
and the circumstances which give rise to a duty that can be
discharged only by
the non-negligent performance of the task."
<P>

162  	After a reference to the definition given in <u>Kondis</u> of
the material relationships which would give rise to a special non-delegable
duty, his Honour said (at 332/3):
<P>

"In cases where this special duty is imposed on a person in relation to a
particular task that person is under a duty not only to
use reasonable care,
but to ensure that reasonable care is used by any independent contractor whom
he employs to perform that task.
(<u>Hughes v Percival</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%208%20AC%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 8 APP Cas 443</a>
at 446).  Moreover, if the task which an independent contractor is employed to
perform carries an inherent risk of damage to the
person or property of another
and the risk eventuates and causes such damage, the employer may be liable even
though the independent
contractor exercised reasonable care in doing what he
was employed to do, because the employer authorised the running of the risk
and
the employer may be in breach of his own duty for failing to take the necessary
steps to avoid the risk which he authorised.
 In <u>Burnie Port Authority v
General Jones Pty Ltd</u>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20520" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 520</a> at 580 following Stephen J, in
<u>Stoneman v Lions</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20133%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 133 CLR 550</a> at 564,  noted that the employer of
an independent contractor would be personally liable:
<P>

"if the risk of damage arises from the way in which the work will necessarily
be done or from the way in which the employer expects
that it will be done (as
in <u>Black v Christchurch Finance Co </u>(1894) AC 48 or <u>McInnes v
Wardle</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1931] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2045%20CLR%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 45 CLR 548)</a> for in each of those situations the incurring of
the risk is authorised by the employer.  But the employer is not liable merely
because
it is foreseeable that the independent contractor might, on his own
initiative, adopt a careless way of doing the work.  If liability
were imposed
on an employer in that situation, the employer would become a virtual guarantor
of the independent contractor's carefulness'.
<P>

Cases of special relationships aside, the duty of care that arises when a task
to be performed does not carry an inherent risk of
damage to the person or
property of another may be discharged by the engaging of a competent
independent contractor to perform it.
 Whether a task does or does not carry an
inherent risk of damage to another's person or property is a question of fact
to be determined
in the light of common experience."
<P>

163  	By reason of the different approaches taken in this decision,
it is difficult to draw any clear conclusion from it as to the
application of
the underlying principle to the present facts.   The decision is however of
assistance in so far as Dawson J (at 345),
Toohey J (at 353), Gaudron J (at
361) and Kirby J (at 401), gave support to the view that the relationships
which give rise to a
special non-delegable duty of care are marked by the
central feature of control on the part of the defendant, or special dependence
or vulnerability on the part of the plaintiff.
<P>

164  	Finally I refer to the decision of the Full Court of the
Supreme Court of South Australia in <u>Le Cornu Furniture and Carpet Centre Pty
Ltd v Hamill</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2070%20SASR%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 70 SASR 414</a>, where an employee of a contractor engaged
by the owner of premises to carry out certain construction work, was seriously
injured
when he fell through a fragile asbestos roof.  Although it was
sufficient for the decision to find, in the context of the Occupational
Health,
Safety and Welfare (Commercial Safety Regulations 1987) (S.A) that the owner,
as an "occupier", owed a statutory duty to
the worker, Matheson and Prior JJ
also held that it owed a non-delegable common law duty of care that had not
been discharged.  
<P>

165  	Matheson J made reference to the passages in <u>Brodribb</u>
(per Mason J at 30-33 and per Brennan J at 47-48,), in <u>Burnie Port
Authority</u> (per the majority at 550-551), and in <u>Northern
Sandblasting</u> (per Brennan J at 331-333), (as well as the passages in the
judgments of Gaudron J at 362-3 and McHugh J at 369 in the last mentioned
decision) in holding that, having regard to the "concatenation of
circumstances" there present, a non delegable duty of care was
owed by the
building owner.  They included the circumstances that an employee of the
building's owner had previously suffered a fatal
injury when falling through
the roof; that the contractor was not qualified by experience or otherwise in
working on fragile roofs;
that no inquiry had been made as to whether it had
any such expertise; that there were no crawl boards or safety equipment on the
roof, and that employees of the building owner were on the premises at the time
of the accident.  The elements of control by the
owner and the special
vulnerability of the plaintiff to the risk of falling were present.
<P>

166  	In agreeing with this conclusion, Prior J added the
circumstance that the building owner was, as the occupier, subject to
specific
statutory obligations to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the health
and safety of any person working in or about
the premises.
<P>

167  	The facts in that case were a good deal stronger than those in
the present case, particularly  having regard to the existence
of actual
knowledge that the roof was dangerous, the absence of expertise on the part of
the contractor, and the existence of a statutory
duty on the part of the
principal to exercise reasonable care. 
<P>

168  	Had Mirvac or Boral in the present case been directly involved
in the co-ordination, supervision or direction of the work
undertaken by the
various sub-contractors, or had the work been carried out by them in close
physical proximity, such as to require
co-ordination or supervision by either
of those defendants, then <u>McArdle</u> and <u>Brodribb</u> would have been
more in point.  Equally might that have been the case had there been any reason
for suspicion that this particular
roof possessed any special feature or risk,
for example because the supporting structure was of a different design to that
used on
the other buildings on which the plaintiff had worked.
<P>

169  	However, in a situation where the trades followed one another,
where the roofing layout was identical to that elsewhere used
on the site, and
where the roof tiler was in a position to assess the job, and to apply its own
expertise in the way that it or he
went about the necessary work, then it seems
to me that the present case falls on the other side of the line.  There is no
reason
to suppose that the various subcontractors were other than competent
themselves to control their system of work without supervision
by or direction
from Mirvac or Boral,  or that there was here any risk of confusion over the
respective areas of responsibility of
any party.
<P>

170  	In summary, when considering the position of the plaintiff vis
a vis Mirvac and Boral, I remain unpersuaded that he was in
a position of
particular vulnerability, or that in the circumstances of the case either
defendant should reasonably have been required
to lay down a system for the
performance by the carpenters of their roofing work, or to supervise the
carpenters' compliance with
any such system, or to inspect their work before
requesting commencement of the roof tiling so as to ensure that the fibro was
so
fixed or marked as to flag the areas on which it was safe for a roof tiler
to work;  or to provide plant and equipment to the plaintiff;
 or to lay down a
system under which he would carry out his work.
<P>

171  	There was no evidence to suggest that there had been any
practice of direction, or supervision by Mirvac or Boral; nor was
there any
evidence to suggest that on this occasion, either party had actual or implied
knowledge of any aspect of the roof framework
that might cause it to be unsafe
for a tiler, beyond the obvious risk of stepping onto fibro at any point where
it was not supported.
<P>

172  	As I have observed, Boral had no control whatsoever over the
roof carpentry, nor did it have any contractual responsibility
for the
integrity or finish of that work.   No question arose as to the reasonableness
of the head contractor engaging specialist
contractors to provide the carpentry
and roof tiling, or as to the reasonableness of those contractors engaging
qualified tradesmen
as subcontractors to provide the labour needed for that
work.
<P>

173  	Mirvac clearly had an interest in ensuring the structural
soundness and compliance of the roof with the relevant building
code and
contractual requirements.  That is a different matter, however, from assuming a
responsibility to ensure that the timberwork
was completed and handed over to
the tiler in a state where the fibro was so fixed or marked up as to show the
line of the supporting
rafters.  
<P>

174  	Neither Mirvac or Boral was in a position, it seems to me, to
lay down the system of work that the independent subcontractors
(Collis
Construction Company and G &amp; S Roofing) should follow.  Moreover, neither
was in a position where they might have been
expected to provide equipment or
plant for the plaintiff.  Any obligation concerning the provision of a safe
place of work, a safe
system of work, or suitable plant and equipment rested
directly and appropriately upon his employer, G &amp; S Roofing. 
<P>

established particularly in master-servant cases, that a degree of
carelessness
or inattention must be expected and catered for (<u>McLean v Tedman</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984)

Northern Territory</u> (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 445 (Brennan J), 454 (Toohey and
Gummow JJ), 460-1 (McHugh J) and at 478 (Kirby J), the present case is in
a
very different situation.   
<P>

176  	The plaintiff here was a skilled tiler, and he knew of the
dangers of stepping onto unsupported fibro.  Walking on rafters
was an everyday
occurrence for him, and it was part of the skill and experience that he brought
to his trade that he cope with that
situation.  It would be somewhat pointless,
if not dangerous, to expect that he should take direction from the principal
contractor
or from other contractors or trades as to what he could or could not
do, in this regard or as to the system of work he should follow.
 
<P>

177  	It borders on the unreal for the plaintiff to argue, as he did,
that an exercise of reasonable care, in this case, required
that he be warned
that the roof on which he was injured was constructed in the same manner as the
preceding fifteen roofs on which
he had worked, on the site.
<P>

178  	As each of these roofs had offset verandah rafters, and as the
buildings were of the same overall design, there was simply
no reason for him
to assume that the roof of this building was any different.  On the contrary,
it was more probable than not that
the configuration was identical.  
<P>

179  	Moreover, the location of two out of every three rafters should
have been apparent to him from above, since he must have known
that the ends or
joins of each fibro sheet were directly supported on rafters.  From their
positions, the location of the intervening
rafter, midway between the joins,
should have also been apparent to him had he looked, as should the fact of
offset.  Upon this basis
the plaintiff did not need a nail line, or chalk
marks, to identify the location of the first and third rafters, or to estimate
the
position of the intervening rafters.
<P>

180  	Other means of locating these rafters, and of ensuring his own
safety, were available.  For example, by tapping the fibro,
the location of an
underlying rafter could be ascertained.  From beneath the fascia, or from the
verandah floor, the rafters could
be seen, and if necessary the fascia or the
fibro could have been marked up by him.  A rule or tape could have been
extended along
the fascia from the brick columns, and marked up with the known
distance between the rafters which was measurable from below.  Other
means of
safely working on the roof using scaffolding, a safety net slung under the
verandah, or a sling and harness were possible.
 Finally, as a last resort, it
was open to the plaintiff to check the position of the rafters with the
carpenters with whom he was
in daily contact.
<P>

181  	The simple truth in this case is that the plaintiff made a
misjudgment, and took a calculated risk, for which in my view he
should be
regarded as solely responsible, in assuming that the verandah rafters were in
line with the main roof rafters.  If he had
been in any doubt about the
situation, then he should have double checked and taken the necessary
precautions.  
<P>

182  	Neither Mirvac nor Boral could have directed him as to the way
that he was to go about his work, nor was he bound to accept
their advice, or
even to assume an entitlement to receive it.  The relevant expertise was his,
and it is by no means evident that
either Mirvac or Boral would have been in
any better position than him to identify the existence of any unusual or
unexpected risk
in relation to the roof, particularly in the absence of any
prior accident of this kind.
<P>

183  	The case is one in which it can properly be said that a
reasonable person in the position of Mirvac or Boral would not have
regarded it
as reasonably necessary to guard against the plaintiff acting in the manner
that he did, where he was an experienced
tradesman whose work required him to
walk on roofs on a daily basis, and where it must have been known by him that
he could only
stand on the fibro where it was supported by an underlying
rafter. 
<P>

184  	Together, these circumstances seem to be a complete answer to
his claim against Mirvac and Boral. 
<P>

<b>Liability of Mirvac and Boral as an Occupier</b>
<P>

185  	Although pleaded and argued as a separate basis for liability,
the plaintiff's claim under this heading needs to be considered
in the light of
the principles already discussed, since the old inflexible rules defining the
duty an occupier of land owed to invitees,
licensees and trespassers have now
been absorbed by the ordinary rules of negligence:  <u>Australian Safeway
Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 479</a> at 484-488, and <u>Burnie Port
Authority</u> at 548.<u> </u>
<P>

186  	No case dependent upon Boral being an occupier was pleaded or
argued, and I am in any event unpersuaded that, in the circumstances
of this
case, its contractual engagement and implied permission to enter onto the site
to deliver tiles, and to inspect tiling work
upon completion so as to determine
compliance with its quality standards and to measure the areas tiled, would
qualify it as an occupier.
<P>

187  	So far as this head of liability is concerned, it is the
condition of the roof framework as left by Collis Construction Company
that is
in issue, as is the question whether in discharging any duty of care resting
upon it as an occupier, Mirvac was responsible
for any unsafe aspect of the
roof.
<P>

188  	As I have already observed, the various categories of entrant,
and the several duties of care, traditionally adopted in the
field of occupiers
liability (see e.g. <u>Lipman v Clendinnen</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1932/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%2046%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 46 CLR 550</a> at 554-5) have
been subsumed in the general principles of the law of negligence.  In
accordance with the decision in <u>Australian Safeway Stores</u> (particularly
at 488) approving the statement of Deane J in <u>Hackshaw v Shaw</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/84.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 84</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20614" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155
CLR 614</a> at 662-3,  the question in this regard is whether, in all the relevant
circumstances, including the fact of Mirvac's occupation of
the site, and the
manner of the plaintiff's entry, it owed a duty of care under the ordinary
principles of negligence.  
<P>

189  	The touchstone of the existence of that duty again turns upon
the proximity of relationship, and the reasonable foreseeability
of a real risk
of injury to the entrant, or the class of persons of which the entrant is a
member.  The measure of the discharge
of that duty, being one to take
<i>reasonable steps</i> to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to such an entrant,
is what a reasonable person would do in the circumstances by way of response
to
the risk: <u>Romeo</u>.  
<P>

190  	This requires reference to what might be a proportional
response to the risk, taking into account its magnitude, the likelihood
of an
accident, happening, the possible serious consequence if it does occur, the
inconvenience, difficulty or expense involved in
meeting it, and the likelihood
that the precaution would have materially reduced the risk:  <u>Franklins Self
Serve Pty Ltd v Bozinovska</u> Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of
Appeal, 14 October 1998 unreported.
<P>

191  	The observations of Kirby J in <u>Australian Safeway Stores</u>
as to the scope of the duty (at 478), and as to what is required by way of the
response of a reasonable man to secure its discharge
(at 479-481) are
instructive in this regard.  It is only within the framework of the
considerations collected by Mason J, in <u>Wyong Shire Council v Shirt</u>, and
discussed by Kirby J in the passages identified, that a determination can be
made as to the risks a defendant should guard against,
and those which it can
safely ignore.  It is not the case that any foreseeable risk, no matter how
remote, must in every case be
guarded against.   Precautions need only be taken
when that course is required by the standard of reasonableness.
<P>

192  	I am not persuaded, in the circumstances, that the plaintiff
can gain any additional benefit by stating his claim in terms
of the duty owed
by an occupier.  Precisely the same considerations that operated in answer to
his claim based upon the general common
law duty of care, seem to me to apply
to this asserted head of liability.  It would be anomalous to fix Mirvac with
liability in
negligence, upon the basis of its occupation of the construction
site, where no such liability attached in relation to its position
as head
contractor.
<P>

<b>Liability of Boral under contract</b>
<P>

193  	Reliance was placed upon terms said to have been implied into
an agreement between Boral and the plaintiff that the fixing
of the rafters
would be carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner;   that the roof would
be safe for the plaintiff to work upon;
 and that the fibro would be affixed so
as not to be positioned beyond the plate to which the rafters were joined, that
it would
not be fixed to offset dummy rafters, and that it would be nailed to
each rafter.
<P>

194  	The short answer to this claim is that Boral did not enter into
any contract with the Plaintiff.  Its contract was with G
&amp; S Roofing.  In
any event, I am not persuaded that the five conditions required for an
implication of such terms into the contract,
in accordance with the decision in
<u>Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a> at 347 were here present.  In particular it does not seem to
me reasonable or equitable, or obvious, that such terms would be implied
into a
contract where Boral had no responsibility for or control over the carpenters
who had subcontracted with another party for
erection of the roof framework, or
where it engaged, as an independent contractor, a qualified roof tiler to fix
the tiles it supplied,
and to whom it was entitled to look for the supply of
labour and any necessary plant or equipment.
<P>

195  	It follows, in my judgment, that Mirvac and Boral are each
entitled to a verdict in their favour.  In case I am found to be
in error, in
this regard, I shall briefly record my findings as to the losses sustained by
the plaintiff as a direct result of his
accident, which would, upon proof of
breach of a statutory or general duty of care, have been recoverable from
them.
<P>

<b>Plaintiff's Losses arising out of the Accident</b>
<P>

196  	There was only limited dispute in relation to the relevant
heads of damages.
<P>

<u>General Damages</u>
<P>

197  	The plaintiff submitted that the range of general damages was
in the order of $50,000 to $70,000.  Mirvac placed the range
in the order of
$55,000 to $70,000.  Boral submitted that it was in the order of $60,000.
Having regard to the serious nature of
the plaintiff's injuries outlined above,
and their continuing effects upon him, I would assess those damages in the sum
of $65,000,
of which I would apportion 50% to the past and 50% to the
future.
<P>

<u>Interest on general damages</u>
<P>

198  	Upon the basis of a calculation extended over sixteen years and
six months at 2% per annum, on one half of those damages,
the interest would
be: 
<P>

16.5 x 32,500 x 2/100 = $10,725.
<P>

<u>Buffer for Impaired Earning Capacity</u>
<P>

199  	The plaintiff's claim was confined to a buffer referable to the
lost opportunity he has had in the past, and will continue
to have in the
future, to supplement his earnings with casual roof tiling work over weekends
or holidays.  I accept that his capacity
to engage in such work has been
substantially destroyed.  He has attempted it, without success, and there is a
sound medical basis
for the difficulty he described.
<P>

200  	The plaintiff argued for a buffer in the sum of $25,000 for the
past, and $40,000 to $50,000 for the future.  Mirvac suggested
a range for the
entire period of $35,000 to $50,000  whereas Boral submitted that any award
along those lines should be confined
to a cushion of $20,000.
<P>

201  	In calculating this loss, I find that it is proper to have
regard to the evidence previously mentioned which suggested that
few tilers
continue to work in this trade for the long term, that the plaintiff has been
and may confidently expect to remain in
alternative full time employment of the
kind in which he has been since the accident, and that the attractions for
undertaking this
kind of heavy work would not have been great while he was
bringing up children, or as he became older.  
<P>

202  	Nevertheless, he has sustained a demonstrable impairment of his
ability to exercise his trade and hence of his earning capacity,
for which a
modest award is appropriate, and which I would apportion, for interest
calculation purposes, as to 66.66% to the past.
 Although an argument to the
contrary was advanced during the trial, it is my understanding that the parties
accept that the plaintiff
would not at the present time be able to establish an
entitlement to an award for partial incapacity under S 11(1) Workers
Compensation
Act, although he may have been able to do so in the past (in
reliance on S 6(3A) or s 6(3)(a) of the Act).  
<P>

203  	The extent to which he would have exercised this additional
capacity to work is problematic, as is its calculation in particular
in
relation to the determination of any offset for a past entitlement to workers
compensation, in accordance with the decision in
<u>Tipper v Williams
(No.2</u>) New South Wales Court of Appeal 17 May 1994).  
<P>

204  	However, the difficulty in such an assessment does not mean
that it should go uncompensated: <u>Russell v J. Hargreaves &amp; Sons Pty
Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2030%20ALJR%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 30 ALJR 533</a> and <u>Blaseotto v Wilson</u> (New South Wales Court
of Appeal 17 May 1978).
<P>

205  	In the circumstances outlined, it would be inappropriate to
attempt  any precise mathematical calculation.  Doing the best
I can, and
allowing for all the factors mentioned, I would come to an assessment of
$40,000 by way of a buffer (both for the past
and the future) in this
regard.
<P>

<u>Adjustment for Contributory Negligence?</u>
<P>

206  	There would still remain a need for a deduction on account of
contributory negligence, if the plaintiff's claim was held to
succeed against
either Mirvac or Boral, on the basis of a tortious duty, but not if it was held
to succeed on the statutory count
or under the contractual count:  <u>Astley v
Austrust Limited</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) HCA 6</a> (ie unless a similar result could be achieved
in relation to the contracted count via the process of reasoning adverted to by
Hope
JA in <u>Harper v Ashtons Circus Pty Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%202%20NSWLR%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 2 NSWLR 395.</a>
<P>

<b>CLAIM AGAINST TAYLOR &amp; SCOTT</b>
<P>

207  	It is clear beyond question that a solicitor is liable for
failing to commence proceedings for a client prior to the expiry
of any
relevant limitation period: <u>Macrae v Stevens</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2081%2d405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) Aust Torts Rep
81-405</a> at 63, 689.
<P>

208  	Upon the basis of the information provided by the plaintiff,
and upon the basis of that which was  available when instructions
were first
taken, it was entirely reasonable for Taylor &amp; Scott to assume that the
proprietor shown upon a search of the business
name Collis Construction
Company, was the appropriate party to sue, ie if the carpenter was to be
joined.  That search was made and
the proprietors were joined, (even if one was
not registered as a proprietor until after the accident).  To that point,
Taylor &amp;
Scott had acted in pursuance of the instructions they had
received, and in accordance with the advice that was given by the second
Counsel whom they had briefed.  No breach of their retainer or of their general
duty of care could be made out, upon that basis.
<P>

209  	The plaintiff's claim must rest upon the fact that the
solicitors were later advised, before expiry of the limitation period,
that
Dorgor and Maului were uninsured, but that Messrs. Collis and Manfredotti held
insurance in respect of the business.  This,
it was submitted, should have
placed them on notice of the possibility, which should have been in
investigated that Messrs Collis
and Manfredotti were in fact the proprietors of
the business and the persons who should be joined; or alternatively, or
additionally
should have alerted them to the need to inquire whether the
insurance policy could be extended to the corporate defendants.  There
was,
however, complete inaction on this account, and no instructions were sought, or
advice given to the plaintiff about it.
<P>

210  	It does not necessarily follow from that inaction that
liability  could be proved on the part of the solicitors.  To establish
negligence, or a breach of their professional retainer, sounding in damages,
the plaintiff must show that something of value (here
a right to claim damages
from Messrs. Collis and Manfredotti), was lost by him:  <u>Nikolaou v
Papasavas</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20166%20CLR%20394" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988)  166 CLR 394)</a>;  <u>Johnson v Perez</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20166%20CLR%20351" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 166 CLR
351).</a>  If no case was available against them, then the plaintiff suffered no
loss: <u>Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%201%20WLR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 1 WLR 563</a> at 574-5
per Lord Evershed MR and <u>Phillips v Bisley</u> (Court of Appeal New South
Wales 18 March 1997.
<P>

211  	In showing that he lost something of value the plaintiff bears
the onus of proof.  The evidence, however, remains obscure
as to the precise
role of Messrs. Collis and Manfredotti.  
<P>

212  	At most what was shown was that Collis Construction Company, of
which Dorgor was the registered proprietor, at the time of
the accident, had
the contract for the roof framing.  It is not clear whether Mr. Collis or Mr.
Manfredotti personally carried out
any work on cluster building 7 and, upon
that basis, was directly responsible for the condition of the roof when it was
handed over
to the plaintiff;  or whether either acted as supervisor of the
apprentices or of any other men working on that building and, upon
that basis,
was responsible for its condition on handover;  or whether either was in some
other way liable to suit either directly
or vicariously.
<P>

213  	I add, in this regard, that vicarious liability would not
attach to Mr. Collis as a director or shareholder of Dorgor;  nor
would it
attract to Mr. Collis as a bare employee of that company, or of Mr. Manfredotti
(if that was also his status), if either
was a co-worker on site.   The
position in relation to Mr. Manfredotti is, in fact, even less clear than that
of Mr. Collis, since
"his company" (Maului) was not registered as a proprietor
of Collis Construction Company until well after the accident.
<P>

214  	Upon what basis each was named as the insured, in respect of
the public liability policy referred to in the letter from Dexter,
Healey &amp;
Company, and when that policy of insurance was first issued, remain utterly
obscure, in the absence of the tender of
the policy or of any relevant further
investigation having been carried out in relation to it, either by Taylor &amp;
Scott or by
any of the plaintiff's subsequent legal advisers.  Equally it
remains obscure, assuming that the policy had been in force at the
time of the
accident, and assuming that Messrs Manfredotti and Collis had been partners
before the formation of Collis Construction
Company, whether rectification
would have been possible to bring Dorgor and/or Maului within its coverage.
Additionally, there was
no evidence whether or not Messrs Collis and
Manfredotti had any assets, or whether access could be secured to the insurance
policy,
the terms of which and currency of which were not proved.
<P>

215  	These remain formidable hurdles for the plaintiff to overcome
in establishing that Taylor &amp; Scott  were negligent in not
joining Messrs
Manfredotti and Collis as defendants, even making full allowance for the
conversations he has variously attributed
to them, and upon which he would seek
to rely as admissions, and similarly making full allowance for what might have
been discovered
had proper inquiry been made at the time.
<P>

216  	There remains a further hurdle in that I am not persuaded, on
the evidence, that the roof framing was left in a state that
would give rise to
a claim of negligence against the carpenters (using that term generically).
<P>

217  	There was no clear evidence of any general industry practice as
to the marking up of roofs by carpenters so as to assist roof
tilers, as
distinct from doing so for their own assistance, or as a necessary consequence
of the nailing down of the fibro sheets.
 Again the plaintiff bore the onus in
this regard.
<P>

218  	For similar reasons to those mentioned in relation to the
claims against Mirvac and Boral, I am not persuaded that an exercise
of
reasonable care on the part of the carpenters, called for them to mark up the
position of the rafters.  Again they were entitled
to take into account the
expertise of the roof tiler, his assumed knowledge of the need to avoid walking
on fibro where it was not
directly supported, and his ability and
responsibility to determine for himself where the rafters were located, if he
was in any
doubt about that.
<P>

219  	The case is accordingly one where upon my assessment, the
plaintiff has not shown that he had a cause of action against Messrs
Collis and
Manfredotti personally, or a case which could reasonably have been formulated
against them.
<P>

220  	It would not be enough for him to succeed in an action against
Taylor &amp; Scott to argue, using the words of Lord Evershed
MR in
<u>Kitchen</u> (at 251):
<P>

"Though I had no claim in law, still, I had a nuisance value which I could have
so utilised as to extract something from the other
side, and they would have
had to pay something to me in order to persuade me to go away."
<P>

221  	The position would have been otherwise had the plaintiff been
able to show sufficient prospects of maintaining a claim, for
the Court to say
that it is likely that he would have received a valuable offer of settlement,
even if worth considerably less than
100% of his actual loss.  In
<u>Phillips</u>, Mason P said, in relation to the distinction between this kind
of case and the one where the plaintiff's claim is more of a "derisory
or
nuisance value":
<P>

"Difficult and elusive though the distinction may be, the court trying the
issue of the lawyer's negligence must proceed on the
evidence before it.  This
involves considering the factors mentioned in the passage quoted from
<u>Nikolaou</u>, including "the evidence that would or <i>should</i> have been
available to the plaintiff at that time" (<i>emphasis added</i>).   It also
involves looking at the likely response of the other party or parties in the
lost proceedings (ie those which would,
but for the lawyer's negligence have
been prosecuted in a timely way).  Among other things this requires the court
trying the negligence
claim to make due allowance for the fact that a less than
well informed or overly cautious lawyer for the defendant faced with a
claim in
the lost proceedings might have made a valuable settlement offer.  But what the
trial judge cannot do, in my opinion, is
shut his or her eyes to the evidence
showing the information that was known to or was reasonably obtainable by all
litigants in the
lost proceedings pointing towards an objective assessment of
the plaintiff's prospects of success in the lost action".
<P>

222  	As I have observed, a great deal of speculation would be
required, which I am not prepared to undertake, as to what might
have been
discovered had further inquires been made concerning the carpenters and the
insurance policy.  Additionally, even if it
could be shown by those further
inquiries, that Messrs Manfredotti and Collis might have been in a position
where they personally
owed a duty of care, and that there was a reasonable
prospect of attracting a valuable offer of settlement or of effecting recovery
under a judgment either from them or from the insurer, I remain unpersuaded,
for the reasons previously advanced, that it would have
been reasonably open to
the plaintiff to make the cause of action good.  
<P>

223  	Upon that basis I am not persuaded that anything of value was
lost through the pleaded negligence of Taylor &amp; Scott. 
In those
circumstances it is unnecessary to venture into the areas of some complexity
that were addressed in relation to the assessment
of damages concerning, for
example, the date at which the value of the lost chance should be assessed;
the manner in which interest
should be calculated on the sum assessed; the
extent to which there should be an adjustment to any claim for economic loss,
on account
of any entitlement to workers' compensation that the plaintiff had
at the time at which the assessment should be made;  the appropriate
discount
for the contingencies of litigation referrable both to the prospects of success
(<u>Johnson v Perez</u>; <u>Dolman v Penrose</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1983%20SASR%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983 SASR 481)</a>  <u>Scott v
Echegary</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20ATR%2081%2d120" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) ATR 81-120)</a> and the prospects of recovery upon a judgment
(<u>Murphy v Miller</u> (NSW Court of Appeal 16 October 1998);  and the
allowance to be made for the additional net costs involved in a notional trial
referable
to the joinder of the carpenters (<u>Nyman v Valmas</u>  New South
Wales Court of Appeal 26 June 1997).
<P>

224  	For these reasons there will be a verdict for Taylor &amp;
Scott, irrespective of whether or not the defence based upon the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>
was made good.  It is convenient to consider that defence in the context of the
claim against Keddies, against the contingency that
this matter might be taken
on appeal, so that the Court of Appeal may at least have some expression of the
view  which I reach at
first instance, upon this vexing question.
<P>

<b>CLAIM AGAINST KEDDIES</b>
<P>

225  	Having regard to the conclusion reached in relation to the
plaintiff's claim against Taylor and Scott, this claim fails in
limine.  I am
not satisfied that the plaintiff suffered any loss through the failure of
Taylor and Scott to sue Messrs Collins &amp;
Manfredotti before expiry of the
limitation period.
<P>

226  	If I am incorrect in that conclusion, then I would observe that
there would need to be a further discount and adjustment in
any assessment of
damages against Keddies, referable to the additional contingencies and costs
involved in litigating a claim against
Taylor &amp; Scott, and referable to the
different date for any notional trial of those proceedings.  An assessment of
damages made
in respect of a claim against Keddies would not necessarily be the
same as an assessment of damages in respect of a claim against
Taylor &amp;
Scott, or against the carpenters.
<P>

227  	Again, I consider it unnecessary to engage in any exercise of
assessing the damages that would be recoverable in respect of
this claim.  It
is hypothetical and it would depend upon factual findings that would be
inconsistent with my own findings.
<P>

228  	I will, however, deal with the argument of Taylor &amp; Scott
that the limitation period, so far as they are concerned, ran
out on 10
November 1994.  This was upon the assumption that they had until 10 November
1988 to join Messrs Collis and Manfredotti
as parties, and that any cause of
action against them commenced to run from the date that this claim became
statute barred.  In support
of that proposition they relied upon
<u>Doundoulakis v Antony Sdrinis &amp; Co</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20ATR%2080%2d199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) ATR 80-199 (Supreme</a> Court
of Victoria).
<P>

229  	In that case a firm of solicitors was sued for negligence, and
for breach of contract, for failing to commence proceedings
in time against the
plaintiff's employer in respect of a work related injury.  The issue which
arose was whether the plaintiff's
cause of action against the solicitors was
complete, so that time began to run, when his claim against the employer became
statute
barred, or whether that occurred (as the appellant contended) only when
the employer filed a defence relying upon the Limitation
act.
<P>

230  	The Court of Appeal (Ormiston J, with whom McGarvie and Marks
JJ agreed) held (affirming the decision of Lush J appealed from)
that the
period for bringing the proceedings against the solicitors commenced on the
expiration of the period for bringing proceedings
against the employer.
Ormiston J, said that:
<P>

"It is well accepted that: `a cause of action in negligence is complete when
the damage caused by the breach of duty is sustained.
 It is at that time that,
in the ordinary case, the cause of action (accrues) for the purposes of a
provision such as (sec. 5) of
the <i>Limitations of Actions Act</i> : per Deane
J in <u>Hawkins v Clayton</u> (1988).
<P>

231  	In dismissing the argument that damage was not sustained until
the defendant pleaded the defence, Ormiston J noted that the
appellant's
argument depended on "drawing the familiar distinction between barring the
remedy and barring the right, which derives
from the Court's insistence that
the right can only be lost if the statute is pleaded".  His Honour observed,
(at 67964):
<P>

"No doubt the consequence is that a defendant cannot ordinarily call in aid the
<i>Limitation of Actions Act </i>unless he pleads it, but it does not follow
that the plaintiff's rights and remedies are unaffected by the passing of the
limitation
period.  The appellant sought to draw from the mere unenforceability
of his rights against the employer that -
<P>

a)	his right to damages subsisted in an unimpaired form until the defence was
relied upon and
<P>

b)	consequently, that no damage was suffered until a defence relying on the Act
had been delivered or served.
<P>

Such a conclusion was apparently reached by Miles J in <u>Vulic v Bilinski
&amp; Ors</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20NSWLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 2 NSWLR 472</a> at pp 484-485, although in terms which suggest
that the  point was not the subject of extensive argument".
<P>

232  	In relation to this submission, his Honour said (at 67965):
<P>

Merely because the statute bars the remedy and not the right must not obscure
the fact that each is valuable.  As Isaacs J said,
in comparing a section
extinguishing a right with the `ordinary statute of limitations':
<P>

`The latter finds  a person in possession of a right and a remedy.  In some
cases it abolishes the right, in others it simply bars
the remedy. But in both
cases it takes from the person something he already has independently of the
statute':  The Crown v McNeil
&amp; Anor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1922/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1922] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281922%29%2031%20CLR%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1922) 31 CLR 76</a> at 100. 
<P>

The consequences, for each side, of time running under a statute of limitations
were succinctly stated by Windeyer J in <u>Australian Iron &amp; Steel Ltd v
Hoogland</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1962/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1962] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%20108%20CLR%20471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 108 CLR 471</a> at 489:
<P>

`When time has run against a purely personal action the result, for a
plaintiff, is that his remedy is barred but his cause of action
is not
extinguished:  for a defendant, it is that he has, if he chooses to assert it,
an immunity which Lord Esher called `his existing
right to the benefit of the
Statute of Limitations' (<u>Hewitt v Barr</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281891%29%20QB%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1891) QB 98</a> at 99)'.
<P>

It is the barring of the remedy which is critical in a case such as the
present, corresponding as it does to the immunity which
the defendant then
acquires, albeit it is an immunity he may not choose to assert.  Howsoever one
characterises this conditional
immunity and this conditional barring of the
plaintiff's remedy, the plaintiff is left with a remedy very different in
quality from
that which he had before the limitation period expired.  In the
context of the perennial argument as to procedural and substantive
rights the
following observation has been made and later followed in the High Court:
<P>

"A cause of action which can be enforced is a very different thing to a cause
of action the remedy for which is barred by lapse
of time".
<P>

Per Williams J, in <u>Maxwell v Murphy</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1957/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2096%20CLR%20261" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 96 CLR 261</a> at 278, a passage
cited with approval by Gibbs J (whose judgment was concurred in on this issue
by Menzies, Windeyer and Walsh JJ)
in <u>Yrttiaho v Public Curator of
Queensland</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20125%20CLR%20228" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 125 CLR 228</a> at 241.
<P>

Consequently, upon the expiration of the limitation period on 4 August 1978,
the plaintiff was deprived of his remedy against his
employer, subject only to
the defendant pleading the statute, and to the presently irrelevant power to
obtain an extension of that
limitation period. That conditionally barred remedy
was then substantially less valuable than it previously had been."
<P>

233  	His Honour dismissed the further submission that  no relevant
loss or damage was suffered until the defence was delivered:
(67966)
<P>

"As I have already observed, the appellant had suffered measurable damage the
moment the limitation period had expired, in that
his remedy had been
substantially impaired.
<P>

...
<P>

There is no dispute that the right of action was not completely extinguished
until either the defence was delivered or judgment
in reliance upon that
defence was entered for the defendant employer. Nevertheless, damage in the
relevant sense does not necessarily
require loss of a right, only that the
right and the related remedy should have been impaired to some measurable or
significant degree."
<P>

and later:
<P>

"The argument appeared to equate the incurring of actual financial loss with
the suffering of damage, but it is more than apparent
on the authorities that
loss of a chance may fairly be calculated once damage is suffered, although the
particular financial consequences
may not have been worked out in full and may
depend upon future events.  Although there are difficulties, the courts have
held consistently,
other than in <u>Vulic v Bilinsky</u>, that it is
practicable to assess damages in these cases, and that the ordinary rules as to
contingencies will apply in respect of
future loss: see <u>Kitchen v Royal Air
Force Association</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%201%20WLR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 1 WLR 563</a> at 574 and <u>Nickolaou v Papasavas,
Phillips &amp; Co</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2080%2d900" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) Aust Torts Reports 80-900.</a>  In the present case,
there would be little difficulty in assessing the likelihood of the defendant
employer relying on the Statute
of Limitations, as in fact it did.  If one
remembers that it is not essential to show loss of the right of action but only
significant
impairment of that right, in order to establish that damage has
been suffered, then it is not hard to see that the defendant's acts
in failing
to commence the action within the three year period resulted in significant
harm to the plaintiff the moment that period
had expired."
<P>

234  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> (NSW) relevantly provides:
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">S14</a> (1) An action on any of the following causes of action is not maintainable
if brought after the expiration of a limitation period
of six years running
from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff or to
a person through whom he claims:
<P>

(a) a cause of action founded on contract (including quasi contract) not being
a cause of action founded on a deed;
<P>

(b)	a cause of action founded on tort, including a cause of action for damages
for breach of statutory duty;
<P>

(c)	...
<P>

(d)	...
<P>

235  	This provision which operates to bar the remedy, subject to the
postponement provisions contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a>, must be understood in the context
of s 63 of the Act, which provides for <i>extinction</i> of the right or title
to the cause of action upon "expiration of (the) limitation period fixed by or
under (the) Act".  The Section
is in the following terms:
<P>

S 63(1)	Subject to subsection  (2), on the expiration of a limitation period
fixed by or under this Act for a cause of action to
recover any debt damages or
other money, the right and title of the person formerly having the cause of
action to the debt damages
or other money is, as against the person against
whom the cause of action formerly lay and as against his successors,
extinguished."
<P>

236  	The operation of SS 14 and 63(1) were considered in <u>The
Commonwealth of Australia v Mewett</u> (1997) 191 CLR 471.  Dawson J, there
held the view (at 508-510) that, while S14 operated to bar the remedy (a cause
of action in
tort) it was not to be taken to have been "extinguished" until an
application for extension of time had been brought and dismissed.
 Toohey J (at
516-517) and McHugh J (at 532-533) each took a different view, namely that once
the initial time for commencing proceedings
had expired, the cause of action
was extinguished, but that if, at a later time, a successful application for
extension was brought,
then the earlier extinguishment of the right was
"annulled" and it was to be treated as though it had never been extinguished.
They
noted that Hope JA had come to the same conclusion in <u>The Commonwealth
v Dixon</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 601</a> at 610, and it is one that gives, in my view,
proper effect to S 63(1).
<P>

237  	Gaudron J, in <u>Mewett</u> did not determine the precise
status of the cause of action in the interim period, other than to say that the
action is "not finally
statute barred merely because the initial limitation
period" has expired;  "rather the action is thereafter maintainable if the
limitation
period is extended and the action commenced within the extended
period."  The judgments of the remaining members of the Court, Brennan
CJ and
Kirby and Gummow JJ, do not throw any further light on this issue. In these
circumstances, I take the view that I should follow
the approach taken by Hope
JA and by Toohey and McHugh JJ.
<P>

238  	Even if the cause of action could be regarded as being subject
to conditional re-enlivenment, as Gaudron J appears to have
considered, it
would seem more appropriate, once the application for extension is dismissed,
to regard the moment of extinguishment
as the expiry of the original time for
action, rather than the date of dismissal.  This is more in accord with S 63(1)
and with S
61, which provides:
<P>

"Where, after the expiration of a limitation period to which this Division
applies, the limitation period is extended by order under
this Division, the
prior expiration of the limitation period has no effect for the purposes of
this Act."
<P>

239  	This provision contemplates that S 63(1) is of continuing
effect unless an order to extend the limitation period is made.
<P>

240  	Keddies and the Plaintiff placed reliance upon the principle
enunciated by Deane J in <u>Hawkins v Clayton</u> (1988) 164 CLR 539 at
588-591, to extend  the time for commencement of the action.  That case was
concerned with an action brought
by a plaintiff, as executor of the will of a
deceased testatrix, against the defendant solicitors for their failure to take
reasonable
steps to locate the executor, so as to put him in a position to
commence administering her estate.  The damage suffered was the deterioration
of certain property which, it was alleged, might reasonably have been expected
to have maintained its value, had the executor been
able to commence
administering the estate in due time.
<P>

241  	Deane J, categorised the duty of care as one owed to the
testatrix, and following her death, to the estate.  It was, upon
that basis, a
duty the breach of which could only be complained of by the executor
<u>after</u> he had obtained a grant of probate and had entered upon the
administration of the estate.
<P>

242  	In discussing the application of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> to such a
case his Honour said, at 589-590:
<P>

"It is inevitable that a Statute of Limitations will, on occasion, lead to
injustice in the special circumstances of particular
cases.  Such injustice,
when it occurs, is an unavoidable cost of the benefits involved in ensuring
that plaintiffs act promptly
and that defendants are not subjected to the
litigation of stale claims.  The present case falls, in an anomalous category
where
the applicability of a limitation provision such as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14(1)</a> would
invariably involve prima facie hardship and injustice and where any
compensating public benefit, apart from protecting the
courts from being
required to determine issues of distant fact, is absent.  If a wrongful action
or breach of duty by one <i>person not only causes unlawful injury to another
but, while its effect remains, effectively precludes that other from bringing
proceedings</i> to recover the damage to which he is entitled, that other
person is doubly injured.  There can be no acceptable or even sensible
justification of a law which provides that to sustain the second injury will
preclude recovery of damages for the first.  It would,
e.g. be a travesty of
justice and common sense if the law provided that a cause of action lay for
damages for false imprisonment
but then went on to provide that that cause of
action would be lost if the false imprisonment continued for six years after
the cause
of action first accrued.  Likewise, it would be a travesty of justice
and common sense if the law imposed a duty upon a solicitor
to take positive
steps to inform a third person of the contents of a document of which the
solicitor was alone aware and then provided
that any cause of action against
the solicitor for damage caused by a negligent failure to perform that duty
would be lost if the
negligence continued for six years.  It is arguable that
the notion of unconscionable reliance upon the provisions of a Statute of
Limitations which provides the foundation of the long-established equitable
jurisdiction to grant relief in a case of concealment
of a cause of action
until after the limitation period has expired (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a>) should, by analogy, be extended to cover cases such as these where the
wrongful act at the one time inflicts the injury and, while
its effect remains,
precludes the bringing of an action for damages.  It seems to me, however, that
the preferable approach is to
recognise that it could not have been the
legislative intent that the effect of provisions such as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 14(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> should be that a cause of action for a wrongful act should be
barred by lapse of time during a period in which the wrongful act itself
effectively precluded the bringing of the proceedings.  On that approach, the
reference in s 14(1) of the Act to the cause of action
first accruing should be
construed as excluding any period during which the wrongful act itself
effectively precluded the institution
of proceedings." 
<P>

243  	It can be seen that it was the tortious act complained of, ie
the failure to take reasonable steps to find the executor, which
was the event
that made it impossible for the cause of action to be pursued during the
limitation period.  It was in those circumstances,
that Deane J, held that the
cause of action was not statute barred.  As Gleeson CJ observed in <u>Sampson v
Zucker</u> (Court of Appeal New South Wales 11 December 1996), the principal
enunciated by Deane J, was not applied by the other members of
the High
Court.
<P>

244  	In <u>Sampson</u> the plaintiff brought proceedings against his
former solicitor for negligent advice in relation to the settlement of a claim
for
damages arising out of a motor vehicle accident.  It was acknowledged that
the alleged negligent conduct upon which the cause of
action was based occurred
on or before the date the original proceedings were settled.  It was also
acknowledged that the alleged
cause of action was complete and had accrued by
that date.
<P>

245  	Without deciding whether the principle enunciated by Deane J in
<u>Hawkins</u> was correct, Gleeson CJ (with whose judgment Cole JA and Simos
AJA agreed) held it to have no application since the tortious act
for which the
respondent solicitors were sued did not effectively preclude the plaintiff from
doing anything.
<P>

246  	Of immediate relevance to the present case, is the observation
of Gleeson CJ at 8:
<P>

"It should be mentioned in conclusion that the appellant does not present an
argument based upon the proposition that the cause
of action in the present
case only accrued when the appellant became aware of the alleged negligence of
the respondent.  Deane J's
judgment in <u>Hawkins v Clayton</u> is certainly
not authority for any such proposition;  on the contrary, at least by
implication it rejects such a proposition. If
such a proposition were true it
would have been quite unnecessary for his Honour to formulate and rely upon the
principle which I
have already mentioned." 
<P>

247  	In <u>Registrar General v Cleaver</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 713</a> at
719, Clarke JA similarly said that:
<P>

"A majority of the High Court has rejected the notion that a cause of action is
not complete until a plaintiff discovers, or could
on reasonable inquiry have
discovered that it had sustained a loss."
<P>

248  	I would regard this as a persuasive answer to the argument
advanced, in the present case, that the cause of action was not
complete, and
that the time for action did not commence to run until the plaintiff
discovered, or could on reasonable inquiry have
discovered, the alleged
negligence of Taylor and Scott.  The decision in <u>Wardley Australia Ltd v
State of Western Australia</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a> does not provide any support
for that proposition, (see Deane J at 540) nor does the detailed review of the
English and Australian
authorities undertaken by Mathews J in <u>Crisp v
Blake</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20ATR%2081%2d158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) ATR 81-158.</a>  Her Honour there accepted that the
"discoverability of damage" test was unlikely to be regarded as an acceptable
criterion for determining
the accrual of a cause of action, although upon its
facts she reached the conclusion that the case properly fell within a
qualification
to the long line of authorities discussed.  That decision went on
appeal, but by consent her judgment declining to strike out the
statement of
claim as statute barred was set aside.
<P>

249  	Counsel for Keddies however, sought to rely upon <u>Wardley</u>
and in particular upon the approval by Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ,
of the comments of Gaudron J in <u>Hawkins</u> (601/602) in support of the
proposition that the plaintiff did not suffer a loss, so as to start time
running, until his application
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> for an extension of the
limitation period failed.  To that point, it was submitted, any loss was
contingent, and akin to that under
consideration in <u>Wardley</u>.
<P>

250  	What their Honours said, in this regard (at 532/3) needs to be
examined.  It was in the following terms:
<P>

"The conclusion which we have reached with respect to the time when the
plaintiff first suffers loss in respect of contingent loss
or liability accords
with the comment of Gaudron J in <u>Hawkins v Clayton</u>: (77)
<P>

"If the interest infringed is an interest in recouping moneys advanced it may
be appropriate to fix the time of accrual of the cause
of action when
recoupment becomes impossible rather than at the time when the antecedent right
to recoup should have come into existence,
<i>for the actual loss is sustained
only when recoupment becomes impossible."</i> (emphasis added)
<P>

Gaudron J went on to point out (78):
<P>

It would be too simplistic to restrict analysis of economic loss merely to a
consideration of reduced value or increased liability."
<P>

The conclusion which we have reached is reinforced by the general
considerations to which we referred earlier.  It is unjust and
unreasonable to
expect the plaintiff to commence proceedings before the contingency is
fulfilled.  If an action is commenced before
that date, it will fail if the
events so transpire that it becomes clear that no loss is, or will be,
incurred.  Moreover, the plaintiff
will run the risk that damages will be
estimated on a contingency basis, in which event the compensation awarded may
not fully compensate
the plaintiff for the loss ultimately suffered."
<P>

251  	This passage clearly does not support a proposition in the much
broader terms for which Keddies contended.
<P>

252  	A submission was also advanced that in so far as the plaintiff
or Taylor &amp; Scott sought to rely upon <u>Doundoulakis</u>, the correctness
of that decision had been thrown into question by <u>Wardley</u>.  It was
argued, in this regard, that in their joint judgment Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron
and McHugh JJ had distinguished at least
some of the English decisions upon
which reliance had been placed in <u>Doundoulakis</u>, and had said if they
were not distinguishable, then they were wrong. (at 529 to 532).
<P>

253  	These submissions need to be understood in the light of the
very different factual situation which arose in <u>Wardley</u>.  There the
plaintiff's action was based upon misleading or deceptive representations that
led the respondent State to enter into
an indemnity in favour of a bank against
a facility granted by that bank to Rothwells Limited.  By the indemnity the
respondent undertook
to hold the bank indemnified against any net loss which
might arise if Rothwells did not  satisfy in full its liability under the
facility.
<P>

254  	In the joint judgment the liability was said to be "contingent
and executory", their Honours observing  (at 524-525):
<P>

"The indemnity was not one of a kind which generates an immediate
non-contingent liability to pay upon execution of the instrument.
 It was
neither a promise to meet a liability of the promisee to make a payment nor a
promise to pay a debt owing by a third party
to the promisee (47).  In our
view, the indemnity, on its true construction, was one which created a
liability on the part of the
respondent to the Bank to make payment if and when
the Bank's relevant "net loss" was ascertained and quantified (48), subject to
the making of a demand for payment by the Bank.  The liability was, therefore,
in conformity with the opinion of the Full Court,
contingent and executory.
The likelihood, perhaps the virtual certainty, that there would be a loss, in
the light of Rothwell's actual
financial position as it stood when the
indemnity was executed, did not transform the liability into an actual or
present liability
at that time."
<P>

255  	The English decisions which were examined were essentially
those based on <u>Forster v Outred &amp; Company</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20WLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 WLR 86</a>, which had
been accepted and applied by the Full Court of the Federal Court in <u>Jobbins
v Capel Court Corporation Ltd</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/538.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 538</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2025%20FCR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 25 FCR 226.</a>  <u>Forster</u> was
explicable, their Honours said, by reference to the immediate effect of the
execution of the mortgage that had been given, following
negligent advice from
a solicitor, on the value of the plaintiff's equity of redemption.  
<P>

256  	That and the other decisions noted (in particular <u>D W Moore
&amp; Co v Ferrier</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%201%20WLR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 1 WLR 267</a> and <u>Islander Trucking Ltd v Hogg
Robinson Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20All%20ER%20826" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 All ER 826)</a> it was said, "turned on the plaintiff
sustaining measurable loss at an earlier time (ie on entry into the agreement)
quite apart
from the contingent loss which threatened at a later date".
<P>

257  	What their Honours said in relation to this needs to be noted,
in the light of the submission which went to the basis underlying
<u>Doundoulakis</u>:
<P>

"If, contrary to the view which we have just expressed, the English decisions
properly understood support the proposition that where,
as a result of the
defendant's negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff enters into a contract
which exposes him or her to a contingent
loss or liability, the plaintiff first
suffers loss or damage on entry into the contract, we do not agree with them.
In our opinion,
in such a case, the plaintiff sustains no actual damage
<i>until the contingency is fulfilled and the loss becomes actual</i>;  until
that happens the loss is prospective and may never be incurred." (at 532)
<P>

258  	<u>Wardley</u> and the kind of case mentioned in this passage,
are very different from the present case.  They were matters where, at the time
of
the negligent act, and at the time of expiry of the initial time for action,
any loss was contingent or prospective.  It might never
be incurred.
<P>

259  	In the present proceedings, once the cause of action against
the carpenters was barred by expiry of time, the plaintiff suffered
an
immediate and quantifiable loss.  The only possible respect in which any loss
could be avoided was if a successful application
could be later brought under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>, to extend the period of time for action.  I do not agree
that this converted the loss into a contingent or prospective loss of the
kind
contemplated in <u>Wardley</u>; nor do I agree, for the reasons previously
given, that <u>Mewett</u> stands as authority for the proposition that the loss
remained prospective or contingent until an application for extension of the
limitation period was brought and dismissed.
<P>

260  	The next submission advanced by Keddies, although not by the
plaintiff, rested upon the notion that there was an equitable
duty which Taylor
&amp; Scott owed to the plaintiff, by reason of the fiduciary relationship in
which they stood, which meant that
it was unconscionable for them to plead the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> in answer to any claim for negligence.  This was said to be a
species of equitable fraud, not dependent on moral turpitude, and hence
different from the concealed fraud for which provision is made in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 55</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.
<P>

261  	While it may be accepted that a solicitor owes a fiduciary duty
to a client, <u>Breen v Williams</u> (1996) 70 ALJR 772, at 782 and 790;
<u>Boyce v Mouat</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%203%20WLR%201021" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 3 WLR 1021</a> at 1028, it does not follow that
fiduciary duties and obligations attach to all aspects of the relationship, or
to acts done in implementation
of obligations arising from the contractual or
tortious relationship of solicitor and client: <u>Macedone v Collins</u> (1996)
7 BTR 15,127 per Cole JA at 15,132.  
<P>

262  	No unequivocal authority was cited in support of the
proposition that the existence of a fiduciary relationship prevents a
solicitor
from relying on a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> when sued.  The differences in judicial
opinion in the United Kingdom concerning the question whether, by reference to
the equitable
doctrine of concealed fraud, or the statute prior to the 1980
Act, a subsequent deliberate or fraudulent concealment of the cause
of action
could override the statutory time limit, or cause time to begin running again,
were noted in <u>Sheldon v RMM Outhwaite Ltd </u> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%201%20AC%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 1 AC 102</a>, and
particularly by Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 145.   It is not possible to detect
any consistent or clear line of authority in this
regard.  Such support as does
exist for the barring of a plaintiff from relying on a limitation period seems
to depend upon active
concealment by the defendant:  Ignorance of the wrong or
of a breach of contract alone would seem not to be sufficient:  Meagher,
Gummow
&amp; Lehane <u>Equity Doctrine and Remedies</u> 3rd Ed para 3418.
<P>

263  	I am not persuaded that Keddies or the plaintiff can derive
from <u>Sheldon</u> or from the decisions there examined, a broad principle
along the lines suggested.  Further, so far as any of these decisions depend
on
deliberate or fraudulent concealment, I am not persuaded that the evidence in
the present case would support such a finding. 

<P>

264  	As a related argument it was submitted that Taylor &amp; Scott
owed an equitable duty to exercise reasonable care, to which
the same principle
of concealed fraud applied.  I confess to some difficulty in understanding this
submission.  By analogy the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> would apply to such a claim, since
it is identical to the claim in tort and contract:  Meagher, Gummow and Lehane,
at para 3415,
and see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 23</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.  Nothing said in <u>Macedone</u>
would justify any different conclusion.  
<P>

265  	Further, so far as the argument rests upon the doctrine of
unconscionability in equity, no circumstance has been identified
that would
here qualify as such, other than the asserted failure of Taylor &amp; Scott to
advise the plaintiff of his entitlement
to sue them, after the initial time for
action had expired.  In the circumstances outlined, where an application to
extend time was
brought and the plaintiff was advised of its dismissal, and of
the consequences, and where he had time to sue Taylor &amp; Scott,
I cannot see
any basis upon which the doctrine of unconscionability could attach. 
<P>

266  	The final submission advanced on behalf of Keddies, was that
Taylor &amp; Scott owed a continuing duty, after expiry of the
initial time for
action, to advise the plaintiff of his rights, and of his entitlement to sue
them.  This it was submitted, was a
continuing duty, the breach of which
continued until the time that they ceased to act for him, so that a fresh cause
of action accrued
each day that there was a non disclosure.  Even assuming that
such a duty did exist, no such breach has been pleaded.  Such a cause
of action
would be very different from the claim brought, which is confined to the
asserted negligence of Taylor &amp; Scott in failing
to sue the carpenters. No
amendment was sought to amend the Statement of Claim which was filed by Keddies
themselves, and I am not
prepared to allow the proceedings to be further
expanded to accommodate this further submission.
<P>

267  	In summary the present is not a case of the kind contemplated
by Deane J in <u>Hawkins</u>.  Nothing that Taylor &amp; Scott did prevented
the plaintiff from bringing an action against them.  They were dilatory in
considering
whether or not to join the carpenters,  but once the Master
dismissed the application in November 1993, the plaintiff had another
year to
bring an action against them. He was aware of his entitlement to do so, and he
had instructed Keddies accordingly.   
<P>

268  	In those circumstances I am unpersuaded that the principle
enunciated by Deane J can apply.  Nor am I persuaded that there
was the form of
"dishonesty or moral turpitude" of which McLelland CJ in Eq spoke in
<u>Hamilton v Kaljo</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 381</a>, or the consciousness of wrongdoing
of which Mahoney ACJ spoke in <u>Seymour v Seymour</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 358</a> that
would bring this case within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 55(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.
<P>

269  	Moreover, the case is not one where, as at the expiration of
the time to bring action against the carpenters, the loss was
contingent or
prospective, as was the case in <u>Wardley</u>, or one that was dependent on
some extrinsic circumstances, for example an action taken by a third party, as
was the case in <u>Cirino v Registrar General</u> (1993) 6 BPR 97452,
<u>Registrar General v Cleaver</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 713</a>, and <u>Christopoulos v
Angelos</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 700.</a>  At that point, assuming that the plaintiff
previously had a chance of bringing successful proceedings against Taylor &amp;
Scott,
the action was barred and the damage was actual.  The present case is
distinguishable from these decisions.
<P>

270  	Finally, I am not persuaded that the plaintiff could maintain
the action pleaded against Taylor &amp; Scott, after expiration
of the
limitation period by reference to equitable principles.
<P>

271  	For these reasons I am of the view that Taylor &amp; Scott are
entitled to rely on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 14</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>, as an answer to the claim
brought by the plaintiff against them, and that neither Keddies nor the
plaintiff can avoid that consequence
by reference to the matters discussed.
<P>

272  	For completeness, I observe that the plaintiff did assert
negligence against Keddies in filing an amended Statement of Claim
in which
Dorgor and Maului were effectively dropped from the proceedings.  Although no
substantive argument was developed by the
plaintiff in relation to this
submission, there is no evidence that a cause of action against these companies
would have had any
value.  There are two reasons for that.  
<P>

273  	First, having regard to the conclusions earlier expressed, I do
not believe that there ever was a good cause of action against
the carpenters.
Secondly, even if there was a good cause of action, by the time Keddies were
retained, those companies had been removed
from the Register. No evidence has
been called to show that they could be reinstated, or if they were reinstated,
that access could
be gained to the insurance policy, or to any other source of
funds, from which a judgment might have been satisfied, or from which
an offer
of settlement might have been made.
<P>

274  	There will be a verdict for the defendants in the principal
proceedings, and for the cross defendants on each of the cross
claims.  I will
hear further argument as to costs.
