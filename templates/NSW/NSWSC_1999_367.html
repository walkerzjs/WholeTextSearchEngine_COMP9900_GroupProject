<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 12 December 1997, the appellant was charged with goods
in custody <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s527c.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 527C</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>), following the execution of a search
warrant, on the previous evening, at his home at 629 King Georges Road
Penshurst, by officers
of the National Crime Authority.  That matter came
before the Local Court at Sutherland for hearing before Jennifer Betts LCM, on
8 May, 26 June and 31 August 1998.  On 1 September 1998, Betts LCM found that
there was no prima facie case and dismissed the charge.
<P>

2	The plaintiff thereafter made an application for costs pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>, a section which is in the following terms:
<P>

	"<b>Payment of costs by defendant, or by prosecutor or complainant</b>
<P>

	(1)The Justice or Justices making any conviction or order may in and by such
conviction or order adjudge that the defendant shall
pay to the clerk of the
court, to be by him paid to the prosecutor or complainant, or, in the case of
an order of dismissal, that
the prosecutor or complainant shall pay to the
clerk of the court, to be by him paid to the defendant such costs as to such
Justice
or Justices seem just and reasonable.
<P>

	(2) The amount so allowed for costs shall in all cases be specified in the
conviction or order.
<P>

	(3) (a)For the purpose of the exercise of the power conferred by subsection
(1), any order made under subsection (1) of section
556A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a>, shall have the like effect as a conviction.
<P>

	(b)The amount allowed for costs under subsection (1) as extended by this
subsection shall be specified in the order made under
subsection (1) of the
said section 556A and that order shall be deemed to be an order whereby a sum
of money is adjudged to  be paid
within the meaning of this Act.
<P>

	(4)Costs are not to be awarded in favour of a defendant unless the Justice or
Justices is or are satisfied as to any of the following:
<P>

	(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an
unreasonable or improper manner;
<P>

	(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad
faith or were conducted by the prosecution in an improper
manner;
<P>

	(c)	that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate
properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware
or ought reasonably to have
been aware and which suggested either that the defendant might not be guilty or
that, for any other reason,
the proceedings should not have been brought;
<P>

	(d)	that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct
of the proceedings by the prosecution, it is just
and reasonable to award
costs.
<P>

	(5) Subsection (4) does not apply to the awarding of costs against an
informant or complainant acting in a private capacity."
<P>

3	The application for costs was refused, and these proceedings have now been
commenced for orders in the nature of certiorari and
mandamus, to quash the
order refusing to award costs to the plaintiff, and to remit the proceedings to
the Local Court to be dealt
with according to law.
<P>

4	The facts are set out in the reasons for dismissing the charge.  They show
that upon their arrival and before executing the search
warrant, the police saw
the plaintiff, his wife, one of his children and another person in the house.
When police knocked on the
door, each of these persons moved quickly from the
loungeroom area towards the rear of the premises.  During the search, a total
of $10,835 in bank notes was found, made up of $8,000 in bundles of $50 notes
located between two pairs of shorts on the top of a
dressing table in the
plaintiff's bedroom, $1,000 in a bundle of $50 notes located in a drawer of a
tallboy in his bedroom, $1,345
in $5 notes located under the bottom drawer of
the tallboy, and $490 in $5 notes located in a bedside table.  The goods in
custody
the subject of the charge were those banknotes.
<P>

5	Additionally during the search, a plastic decor lunchbox containing two
resealable bags of green vegetable matter, later found
to be 5.3 gms of
cannabis, was located in a chlorine drum at the rear of the premises.  The
plaintiff said that the drum was his,
but that he had not seen its contents
before.  A fingerprint of someone other than the plaintiff was found on the
lunchbox.  A box
of similar GLAD plastic sandwich bags was found in the kitchen
area, as well as another lunchbox similar to the one found in the
chlorine
drum.
<P>

6	The plaintiff informed police, when the money was found, that it was his and
represented his life savings as well as some gambling
winnings.  He was a
pensioner and not working.  He participated in an ERISP but declined to answer
any questions other than to supply
his name and address.
<P>

7	Following his arrest, the plaintiff's solicitors sent a number of letters to
the National Crime Authority and to the Police Prosecutor
at Sutherland
inviting dismissal of the charge.  In the course of the correspondence the
plaintiff's solicitor advised that he was
a keen punter and kept his gambling
winnings at home.  It was asserted that on 12 August 1997, he had backed a
winner with the TAB
which had returned a dividend to him of $13,200.  A letter
from the TAB confirming that a dividend in that sum had in fact been paid
out,
on ticket number 6097151430, for an each way bet of $1000.  The holder of the
ticket was not identified, but it would appear
from a letter dated 8 September
1998, annexed to an affidavit in support of the application, that documents
inspected upon the return
of a subpoena addressed to the TAB, showed that the
dividend was paid out to one Norman Yates.
<P>

8	In relation to the sum of $1345, it was asserted by the plaintiff's solicitor
that he had been saving $5 notes for his son for
a considerable time.  The
other money was said to represent savings and winnings.
<P>

9	In relation to the cannabis found in the back yard, the possibility of it
having been placed there at a recent party by friends
of one of the plaintiff's
teenage children, and then forgotten, was raised.  The presence of plastic bags
and similar items in the
kitchen area were suggested to be innocent, such items
being common place in most homes.
<P>

10	Upon the basis of that material it was submitted that the prosecution was
bound to fail and that the proceedings should be discontinued.
<P>

11	On 9 April 1998, the National Crime Authority replied advising that the
representations had been considered, but that the prosecution
was to
proceed.
<P>

12	The charge sheet as presented was in the following terms:
<P>

	"That John Leslie FOSSE between the 11th day of December 1997, and the 12th
day of December 1997, at PENSHURST in the State of
New South Wales, did have on
premises $10,835 which may be reasonably suspected of being stolen, or
otherwise unlawfully obtained."
<P>

13	In the course of the proceedings, the magistrate had, in the exercise of the
discretion reserved under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 137</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, excluded surveillance evidence
that would have shown that another person, a Mr. Clarke, visited the home of
the plaintiff that day
and left those premises carrying something;  as well as
evidence showing that when his vehicle was stopped that night it contained,
in
the boot, a quantity of methylamphetamine.
<P>

14	After recording the matters led by the prosecution, and noting that the
plaintiff had not denied the presence of money in the
house, and had given an
explanation that it represented his life savings, as well as some gambling
winnings, Betts LCM said, in relation
to the no case submission:
<P>

	"... the Court must take into account at this stage the prosecution case at
its highest in determining whether the prosecution
have established the
elements to the requisite standard, at least at prima facie level.
<P>

	The counsel for the defendant indicates that the evidence is falling short in
relation to satisfying the Court that money was reasonably
suspected of being
stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.   Possession of large sums of money in
itself is not unlawful and the
prosecution are relying upon the other
circumstances - namely, the so-called movement of the occupants of the house in
the loungeroom
towards the rear when the knock on the door occurred, the
finding of the cannabis in the rear yard and the similar items found in
the
kitchen, though taking that into account, probably in just about every kitchen
in New South Wales one would find similar items
in any event, certainly in my
kitchen and the items of money being found in the positions in which they were,
being a number of circumstances
which would suggest that the money found was
unlawfully obtained with the inference being drawn and the only inference
perhaps is
that they were the proceeds of some drug dealing.
<P>

	The search warrant was executed and the information given to the issuing
justice was to search items in relation to drug use and
drug supply and the
seizing of any items in relation to the use or supplying of prohibited
substances and drugs.  No prohibited items
were located on the property and
apart from the cannabis in the container in the chlorine drum in the rear yard
and the prosecution
asks that those circumstances be taken into account in
assessing whether it has been able to establish that money seized by police
may
reasonably be suspected of being unlawfully obtained.
<P>

	In my view, the evidence falls short of establishing that the money was
unlawfully or may reasonably be suspected of being unlawfully
obtained.  The
factors themselves can be seen to be innocent enough, but even with the
combined factors of the movement of the occupants
of the premises, the Court
also takes into account the time and one of those persons who moved was indeed
one of the children of
the defendant.  The Court also takes into account the
conversation had by the police with the defendant which was recorded on video
and there's really no dispute in relation to that.  There's been no denials of
having money in the premises by the defendant and
the money itself, whilst
unusual being not in a banking institution, I do not feel that the evidence,
taken at its highest, is capable
of satisfying beyond reasonable doubt that the
money was reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully
obtained. 
Accordingly, the charge will be dismissed, there being no prima
facie case."
<P>

15	In dealing with the application for costs, Betts LCM said:
<P>

	"...at the close of the prosecution case, application to have the matter
dismissed indicating no prima facie case was successful.
 It has now been
submitted on behalf of the defendant application made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 81</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> for costs.  Principally, the defendant's relying upon ss (4c) that
the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate or to investigate
properly
any relevant matter which it was aware or reasonably ought to have been aware
that suggested either the defendant might
not be guilty or that for any other
reason, the proceedings should not have been brought and also relying upon
ss(d) that because
of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct
of the proceedings by the prosecution, it is just and reasonable to award
costs.
<P>

	The facts have already been outlined by me and there were representations made
on the defendant's behalf to the National Crime
Authority who brought the
proceedings and also to the prosecution or the police prosecutors.  A decision
was made to proceed with
the charge under Section 527(c) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>
against the defendant and evidence sought to be adduced at the outset also
involved evidence of police stopping and arresting a person
by the name of
Clark.  That person was found with a large amount of amphetamine in the boot of
his car and due to reasons previously
given that the prejudicial effect far
outweighs the probative value of that evidence, the evidence in relation to
surveillance of
the premises and subsequent arrest of the person Clark was not
admitted by me.
<P>

	The prosecution suggests that there's been sufficient evidence for the case to
be brought.  It really was a matter for the Court
to decide and is asking the
Court not to exercise its discretion in allowing costs and if the matter went
into defence evidence,
it's also been suggested that the person who
subsequently obtained the TAB winnings, his credibility would have been put at
issue.
 That may well have been the case.
<P>

	In any event, taking into account the facts as I found them and also the
nature of the evidence against the defendant on the question
of costs, I must
be satisfied that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate any
relevant matter of which it was aware or
ought reasonably to have been aware
that might suggest that the defendant was not guilty and due to that, the
proceedings should
not have been brought.  On the matters put to the Court at
this stage on the question of costs, I can't be satisfied that the prosecution
unreasonably did fail to investigate, that if they did investigate, the
proceedings would not have been brought.
<P>

	In relation to the application under Section 81ss(4c) I do not find anything
in relation to that subsection.  Also in relation
to (d), that because of other
exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the
prosecution, it is just
and reasonable to award costs.  There has been nothing
in relation to the conduct of the proceedings the Court has found makes it
sufficient to be just and reasonable to award costs against the informant.
<P>

	Accordingly, I will exercise my discretion in not making an order for
costs."
<P>

16	As appears from the reasons given for refusing the cost application, the
plaintiff relied principally on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">s81(4)(c)</a> and (d) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.  The
onus rested upon him to bring the case within an exception to the general rule
laid down by the Section that costs are not
to be awarded in favour of a
defendant to proceedings in the Local Court.
<P>

17	In substance, the plaintiff asserts that because the NCA could not prove
that the moneys were stolen or were otherwise unlawfully
obtained, and did not
investigate into, and was not in a position to disprove, the source of the
moneys that had been suggested by
him, the case was always bound to fail.  As a
consequence, it was submitted, the preconditions for a costs order specified in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)(c)</a> and/or (d) were made out.  
<P>

18	The present application falls to be determined by reference to the special
principles applicable where relief is sought in the
nature of certiorari or
mandamus and not as an appeal simpliciter.  Even so, the basis proposition on
which the application was brought,
appears to me to be questionable.  In
particular it overlooks the circumstance that for the offence charged it is
sufficient if the
thing in custody <i>may</i> be reasonably <i>suspected</i> of
being unlawfully obtained.  The word "may" falls short of "is", and the word
"suspected" falls short of "known" or even "convinced"
or "shown":  <u>Anderson
v Judges of the District Court of New South Wales</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20701" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR  701</a> at
714 and <u>Haken v Johnson</u> (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Wood J, 15
October 1993).
<P>

19	In the circumstances outlined where considerable sums of money (a large
proportion being banknotes of a large denomination) were
found in various parts
of the plaintiff's home, where cannabis was also found in that home, and where
the plaintiff was a pensioner,
I am not persuaded that the proceedings were
always bound to fail.  Moreover, when the plaintiff had declined, as was his
right,
to be interviewed in relation to the source of his moneys, and where the
only document offered in support of his claim was one provided
by the TAB
showing a payment out to a third party, I am not persuaded that the NCA
unreasonably failed to investigate or failed to
investigate properly, any
relevant matter which suggested either that the plaintiff was not guilty or
that the prosecution should
not have been brought.
<P>

20	There is no entitlement to costs as of right in criminal proceedings, the
common law principle historically being that the Crown
neither pays nor
receives costs: <u>Latoudis v Casey</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20534" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 534</a> and <u>Le
Boursicot</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2079%20A%20Crim%20R%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 79 A Crim R 549.</a>
<P>

21	In <u>Latoudis</u> Mason CJ said that this rule could not survive once
courts of summary jurisdiction were given a statutory discretion to award costs
in criminal proceedings.  That discretion, however, is exercisable only within
the limits provided by the relevant statutory provision,
in this case <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)</a>
which provides that costs are <i>not</i> to be awarded in favour of a defendant
unless one of the four circumstances specified is shown to exist.  Subsection
(4) was added
after <u>Latoudis</u> and it negatives the majority view, in that
case, that generally when a prosecution fails an order should be made that the
defendant's
costs be paid by the prosecution.
<P>

22	The decisions upon which the plaintiff placed reliance in support of his
application, in which it has been held that the discretion
of Courts of summary
jurisdiction should, in a general way, be exercised in criminal proceedings in
the same way as it is exercised
in civil proceedings, are distinguishable in
that the relevant statutory provisions conferring a discretion to award costs
there
involved were expressed in unfettered terms, without the condition that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S
81</a> (4) attaches to its exercise:  <u>Walters v Owens</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2021%20FLR%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 21 FLR 138</a>;

<P>

23	In relation to the claim for relief in the nature of certiorari, the face of
the record is limited to the charge sheet and the
magistrate's reasons for
declining to make the order for costs:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 69(4)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> and <u>Craig
v The State of South Australia</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d5%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-5) 184 CLR 163</a> at 182.
<P>

24	Jurisdictional error by the Local Court would be shown if it had mistakenly
asserted or denied the existence of jurisdiction,
or if it misapprehended or
disregarded the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it
correctly recognised that
jurisdiction did exist:  <u>Craig</u> at 177.  As the
Court there said:
<P>

	"Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court
will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes
of the writ where it makes
an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it
lacks, or refuses to exercise,
jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken
assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the
nature or
limits of jurisdiction."
<P>

It continued:
<P>

	"Jurisdictional error is at its most obvious where the inferior court purports
to act wholly or partly outside the general area
of its jurisdiction in the
sense of entertaining a matter or making a decision or order of a kind which
wholly or partly lies outside
the theoretical limits of its functions and
powers."
<P>

	...
<P>

	"Less obviously, an inferior court can, while acting wholly within the general
area of its jurisdiction, fall into jurisdictional
error by doing something
which it lacks authority to do."
<P>

	...
<P>

	"Similarly, jurisdictional error will occur where an inferior court disregards
or takes account of some matter in circumstances
where the statute or other
instrument establishing it and conferring its jurisdiction requires that that
particular matter be taken
into account or ignored as a pre-condition of the
existence of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of
the particular case.  Again, an inferior court will exceed its authority and
fall into jurisdictional error if it misconstrues that
statute or other
instrument and thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is
performing or the extent of its powers
in the circumstances of the particular
case.  In the last-mentioned category of case, the line between jurisdictional
error and mere
error in the exercise of jurisdiction may be particularly
difficult to discern."
<P>

25	The record in the present case does not disclose jurisdictional error in any
of these respects.  The learned magistrate did not
misconceive the nature and
extent of her jurisdiction to order costs.  No matter was taken into account or
ignored as a precondition
of the existence of the authority to make or refuse a
costs order, and there is no basis for assuming that the provision was
misconstrued.
 On the contrary, Betts LCM correctly stated the power and its
limits, as well as the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)(c)</a> and (d).  
<P>

26	In these circumstances any error in the exercise of the power conferred
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)</a> even if there was one, would not constitute jurisdictional
error.
<P>

27	Inability to grant certiorari does not stand in the way of a grant of
mandamus:  <u>Ex Parte New South Wales Rutile Mining Co Ltd re: Burns</u>
(1967) 85 WN (Pt1) (NSW) 494 at 504-505;  and <u>Ex Parte Donald re
McMurray</u> (1969) 89 WN (Pt1) (NSW) 462 at 467-468.
<P>

28	Relief in the nature of mandamus pursuant to S 134 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> is
not available as a form of general appeal.  The mistake attracting this
jurisdiction must be one which shows that the ostensible
determination was not
a real performance of the duty imposed by law upon the magistrate:
<u>Waterhouse v Gilmore</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 270</a> at 276, where Hunt J said:
<P>

	"It must be shown that the magistrate misunderstood the nature of the
jurisdiction which he purported to exercise in the matter
before him:  <u>Ex
parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416</a> at 420;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=64%20WN%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">64 WN 107</a> at 109.  Jordan CJ in that case included within the scope of mandamus
the application of "a wrong and inadmissible test" (<u>Estate and Trust
Agencies (1927) Ltd v Singapore Improvement Trust</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281937%29%20AC%20898" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1937) AC 898</a> at 917) and
a misunderstanding by the magistrate as "the nature of the opinion which [he]
is to form": <u>R v Connell</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1944/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] HCA 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2069%20CLR%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 69 CLR 407</a> at 432.
<P>

There is a difference between real, although possibly mistaken performance by a
magistrate of the jurisdiction vested in that office
and the performance of the
jurisdiction in a way that amounts to a constructive failure to exercise it:
<u>Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 397</a> at 418,
where Priestly JA said:
<P>

	"In a decision which has been many times followed in this Court, <u>Ex Parte
Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%20%28NSW%29%204156" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 47 SR (NSW) 4156</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=64%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">64 WN (NSW)
107</a>, Jordan CJ illustrated the difference between a real, although possibly
mistaken, performance by a magistrate of the duty imposed
on him and a
performance of that duty which was not relevantly real, called by him a
constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.
 He made two principal points
(at 420; 109).
<P>

	1.	A magistrate may make a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction
of a statute without constructively failing to exercise
jurisdiction.
<P>

	2.	A mistake of law as to the proper construction of the statute investing a
magistrate with jurisdiction which leads the magistrate
to misunderstand the
nature of the jurisdiction so that (i) he applies a wrong and inadmissible test
or (ii) misconceives is duty
or (iii) does not apply himself to the question
which the law prescribes or (iv) misunderstands the nature of the opinion he
must
form, will make the magistrate's decision one given in a purported and not
a real exercise of jurisdiction."
<P>

29	The decision reached by the magistrate in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)(c)</a> essentially
turned upon her finding that she could not be satisfied that the NCA
unreasonably failed to investigate the matter, or
if they had made further
investigations, the proceedings would not have been brought.  In reaching that
conclusion she made reference
to all of the relevant circumstances and
correctly stated the matter that the defence had to establish.
<P>

30	Similarly in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)(d)</a> she correctly identified that the
defence had to establish something about the conduct of the proceedings being
an "exceptional circumstance"
other than some matter mentioned in subsections
(a)(b) or (c) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 81(4)</a>, to make it just and reasonable for the plaintiff to
have his costs.  In that regard the mere fact that the proceedings were
resolved
in his favour was not enough.  There had to be something in relation
to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted that had
led to it being
just and reasonable for a costs order to be made.
<P>

31	In these circumstances the matter does not fall into the category of cases
where there was not a real exercise of jurisdiction.
<P>

32	For these reasons, the plaintiff's claim must fail, and the summons should
be dismissed.  I order accordingly.  I will hear the
parties in relation to
costs of the summons.
