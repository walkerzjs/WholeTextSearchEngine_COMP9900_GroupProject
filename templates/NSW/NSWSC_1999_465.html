COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 20 MAY 1999
<P>

<u>11683/1998</u>	<u>YOLANDE VICTORIA FRANCES DUBOW v MILLER GODDARD</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	In 1996, the plaintiff instructed the defendant (a firm of solicitors) to act
on her behalf in relation to a property settlement
matter.  Proceedings were
instituted and set down for hearing to commence on 8 December 1997.  Counsel
was briefed (Mr Brereton).
 The matter was resolved by compromise.
<P>

2	The compromise was effected on the first day of the hearing (8 December
1997).  The parties executed a Deed.  In substance, the
compromise saw the
plaintiff receiving the sum of $50,000.00 inclusive of costs.  There is
material to support the contention that
the settlement was reached on the basis
that the plaintiff's costs would be about $20,000.00.
<P>

3	It appears that initially an estimate in the sum of about $10,000.00 for
costs may have been given.  Later, the plaintiff was
informed that the sum of
$20,000.00 was a more realistic figure.  At about the time of the execution of
the Deed the plaintiff signed
a written acknowledgment in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"I also acknowledge that the amount payable pursuant to the said deed of
$50.000.00 includes payment of your costs and disbursements
of acting for me
less amounts previously paid pursuant to agreement dated 12 April 1996 which
costs are approximately $20.000.00.
but not in excess of that amount."
<P>

4	The defendant rendered a Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements in the sum of
$19,623.50.  It was dated 5 January 1998.
<P>

5	The plaintiff applied to this Court for an assessment of the defendant's
costs.  The Court appointed a Costs Assessor (Mr Hattersley).
 He received
submissions (including a detailed objection from the plaintiff and a response
from the defendant).  On 15 June 1998,
he issued a Certificate of Determination
assessing the costs in the sum of $18,732.50.  The certificate noted a credit
to be given
to the defendant for the sum of $11,900.00 paid on account.  The
plaintiff was to pay the sum of $6,832.50.
<P>

6	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 9 July 1998.  The
Summons sought relief pursuant to inter alia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 208L</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">208M</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L</a> provides a limited
avenue of appeal where there is a matter of law arising in the proceedings to
determine the application for assessment.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> enables the making of
an Application for Leave to Appeal.  The Summons contains what is described by
the plaintiff as a "brief but
specific statement of the grounds of appeal".
<P>

7	The relief sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> has been determined by Master Harrison.
It was argued that the Costs Assessor had failed to provide reasons and that
there was a
reasonable apprehension of bias.  The Master delivered a reserved
judgment on 30 September 1998.  The Master was not satisfied that
the Costs
Assessor had erred in law and dismissed the appeal.  The Application for Leave
to Appeal was stood over generally.  The
Court has been informed that this was
done because the plaintiff was not then ready to argue the application for
leave.
<P>

8	Subsequently the application for leave was fixed for hearing.  The hearing
took place on 13 May 1999.  The plaintiff has relied
on a number of affidavits.
It was common ground that this material should be received on the basis of the
evidentiary rulings made
by Master Harrison.  The plaintiff tendered the
documents which comprise Exhibit A.  This material had been placed before the
Costs
Assessor (submissions and response).  The defendant relied on the
affidavit sworn by Mr Miller.  In addition to this material, the
Court had
placed before it detailed documentation prepared by the plaintiff by way of
submission.  This material considerably expands
what is set forth as "the
grounds of appeal" in the Summons.
<P>

9	Subsequent to the judgment of Master Harrison a request for reasons was made
to the Costs Assessor.  He responded by letter dated
19 October 1998 (a copy is
annexed to one of the plaintiff's affidavits).
<P>

10	The letter from the Costs Assessor dated 19 October 1998 informs as to a
number of matters.  I shall mention a few of them. 
It informs that he had
reviewed the material before him at the time of the making of his
determination.  It informs that he had taken
the submissions and objections
into account in reaching that determination.  It informs that he deducted the
sum of $900.00 in aggregate
from the costs and disbursements claimed by the
defendant.  It identifies the items in respect of which the adjustments were
made.
 It informs that as to the other items he considered that the costs
charged in respect of each of them were fair and reasonable and
were allowed on
that basis.
<P>

11	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> confers a discretionary power on the Court.  There was some
conflict between the parties as to the basis upon which leave is granted.
There was reference to passages in the judgment of Sperling J in <u>Kennedy
Miller Television Pty Limited v Lancken</u> (1 August 1997).  In my view, the
power is exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances of the
particular case before the
Court.  Leave may be granted in those cases where it
is considered that the best interests of justice are served by so doing.  The
applicant for leave bears the onus of satisfying the Court that relief should
be granted.
<P>

12	At this stage, I should mention a few matters.  The plaintiff has informed
the Court that an appeal has been lodged against the
judgment delivered by
Master Harrison.  She has further informed the Court that the matter will be
proceeding to the Court of Appeal.
 The amount in dispute is less than
$7,000.00.  This Summons alone has gone to a hearing on two days.
<P>

13	The plaintiff appears in person.  In her material, she describes herself as
inter alia a fully qualified legal practitioner who
has appeared for clients in
this Court.  (However, I note that she also describes herself in the material
as "the lay person in this
instance" and as a person holding a senior position
in this Court).  The defendant is represented by Mr Miller (he is the solicitor
who had the conduct of her property settlement matter).
<P>

14	The stance taken by the plaintiff was that her case was as set forth in the
written submissions.  She did make oral submissions.
 However, these merely
stressed a few of the matters raised in the written material.  I do not propose
to embark on a process of
devoting exhaustive and detailed attention to each of
the many matters sought to be agitated in the written submissions.  This
application
can be dealt with without taking that course.
<P>

15	I have read the submissions made by the plaintiff.  I have given them
careful consideration.  I shall make some general observations
as to what is
agitated in this material.  There are matters which are of no relevance to this
application.  There are matters which
are lacking in factual foundation.  There
are matters which were not put in issue before the Costs Assessor.  There was
an attempt
to re-agitate matters which had been dealt with by Master Harrison.
There were other matters which (if they had been arguable) may
be said to fall
within the category of errors of law which had not been argued when the matter
was before Master Harrison.  In my
view, none of the matters agitated had
merit.
<P>

16	Before proceeding further, I should mention one matter.  It may be that the
Court does not have before it all of the material
given to the Costs Assessor.
The file in application proceedings was not before the Court.  The plaintiff
has made reference to an
unsigned bill of costs dated 20 January 1998. It has
not been put before me.  The material before the Court suggests that the
plaintiff's
application proceeded as an assessment of the signed Memorandum of
Costs and Disbursements dated 5 January 1998 and that this was
the bill
assessed by the Costs Assessor.
<P>

17	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has demonstrated an entitlement to the
grant of leave pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M.</a>  In my view, justice is best served between
the parties by dismissing the application.
<P>

18	I should add that in performing the assessment task, the Costs Assessor was
confronted with a significant volume of material
concerning a bill claiming a
reasonably modest sum.  During this hearing, the Court was not taken to the
detail of this material.
 On what has been put by the parties, I am not
satisfied that he did not have regard to submissions and objections made to
him. 
The Costs Assessor allowed what he regarded as being fair and reasonable.
If it be that there has been some oversight, I do not consider
that it would
give rise to any question (if sustained) of sufficient magnitude to justify the
granting of leave and putting the parties
to the hearing of an appeal and
perhaps a further determination.  I am not satisfied the Costs Assessor has
done other than perform
his task in accordance with the statutory
requirements.
<P>

19	The costs and court time now consumed by these proceedings is manifestly
disproportionate to the amount said to be in issue.
 The defendant contends
that these proceedings are vexatious.  It seems to me that there is force in
that contention.  I observe
that the plaintiff has informed the Court that
other litigation is also contemplated.
<P>

20	I dismiss the Summons.  The plaintiff is to pay the cost of the Summons.
The exhibit may be returned.
<P>
