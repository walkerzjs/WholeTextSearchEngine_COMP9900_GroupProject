<b>70029/99      REGINA v GREGORY PAUL MEGGETT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner has adhered to the plea of guilty
entered at his committal to one count of importing into Australia
prohibited
imports to which s 233B(1)(b) of the <b>Customs Act</b> applied, namely a
quantity of cocaine in an amount not less than the commercial quantity of 2 kgs
applicable to that substance. 
The maximum available penalty for that offence
is imprisonment for life.
<P>

2  	The facts giving rise to the offence, which involved a massive
171.2793 kgs of pure cocaine contained in a bulk seizure 244.8
kgs, with an
estimated street value of $40m to $50 may be briefly stated.
<P>

3  	On 7 December 1998, agents of the Australian Federal Police, in
conjunction with officers of the Australian Customs Service
seized a Boston
whaler located near the southern boat ramp of the outer harbour of Coffs
Harbour. It had previously been launched
from a 52 foot ketch, "Maeva Chiqui",
sometimes referred to as the "Maeva", which had been kept under surveillance
for some little
time prior to its arrival in Australian waters from Tonga.
<P>

4  	This surveillance and investigation had begun in relation to
persons associated with the sloop "Tvareg", which had arrived at
Lord Howe
Island from Tonga in January 1998, and which was still in port at Forster at
the time of the arrival of the "Maeva".  Investigators
ascertained that the
"Tvareg" had sailed from Central America, bound for Australia, via the
Galapagos Islands, French Polynesia and
Tonga. Persons associated with this
vessel were identified, over the months following her arrival, as recipients of
approximately
AUD$6m which was then transferred from Australia to a number of
financial institutions overseas.  This money was suspected of being
the
proceeds of the sale of cocaine in Australia on behalf of one of the Columbian
Medellin cartels.
<P>

5  	Two persons of particular interest were identified, the first
being Robert Scott Flavel, a dual British/Australian passport
holder currently
a resident of Florida in the United States; and the second being Jose Manuel
Campillo, who was found to have deposited
a little more than half a million
dollars in cash in a financial institution for remittance overseas.  This sum
had, in fact, been
seized by the Australian Federal Police in July 1998.  
<P>

6  	In November of that year, investigators learned that arrangements
had been made for one Beatriz Gonzalez-Betes Suarez, (hereafter
referred to as
Gonzales), to travel  to Australia and with the assistance of Campillo, to go
on to Lord Howe Island, to await a vessel
inbound for Australia.
<P>

7  	Some days later Flavel flew into Sydney and contacted Gonzales.
As a result of this communication she and Campillo returned
to Sydney from Lord
Howe Island.  Campillo next went to Taree where he had previously stored a
small boat trailer, while Flavel and
Gonzales went to Coffs Harbour.  Campillo
joined them there a few days later with the boat trailer.
<P>

8  	On 29 November 1998 a conversation between Gonzales and Flavel
was monitored in which they discussed a suitable place for landing
a dinghy in
the Coffs Harbour area.  On 4 December 1998 Gonzales and Campillo left Coffs
Harbour and returned to Sydney, dropping
off the boat trailer at Taree.  On the
following day, the "Maeva" arrived at Coffs Harbour under the command of the
prisoner.  Flavel
met the prisoner upon arrival before travelling on to Sydney
where he made plans to fly out to Hong Kong.  
<P>

9  	During the evening of 6 December 1998, Flavel returned to Coffs
Harbour.  Gonzales and Campillo drove to Taree, picked up the
boat trailer and
continued on to Coffs Harbour where they arrived at approximately 11.30 am on 7
December 1998.
<P>

10  	Earlier that morning Flavel had met the prisoner at the marina.
He was later seen to enter the vehicle in which Gonzales and
Campillo were
travelling.  Several conversations between them were monitored electronically
in the course of which Flavel said that,
as a video camera was located at the
top of the Customs building, the boat would have to be brought around by the
beach.  Campillo
said that he understood it would be taken to the boat ramp.
He was worried that while Flavel did not want the other two to be seen
walking
up to a deserted beach, the boat would have to arrive in the open, otherwise it
would look odd.
<P>

11  	It was agreed that the boat would arrive around lunch time.
There was discussion concerning the positions of the Customs video
camera and
what would happen if Customs stopped either Flavel or the prisoner with the
boat.
<P>

12  	A short time later Flavel left the vehicle and went to the Coffs
Harbour airport where he was arrested by Australian Federal
Police.  A short
time later the prisoner was seen to lower the Boston whaler from the marina
into the water, and to take it across
the outer perimeter of the harbour to a
boat landing ramp, where Gonzales and Campillo were waiting with the boat
trailer. All three
were seen to load and secure the whaler on that trailer.
They were arrested a short time later.
<P>

13  	Examination of the whaler revealed that 225 packages, each
containing approximately 1 kg of cocaine in bulk weight, had been
concealed
within the skins of its hull. 
<P>

14  	On being spoken to by police the prisoner made full admissions
as to his involvement in the importation.  In the course of
the ERISP that
followed his arrest he disclosed he had been asked to bring the "Maeva" to
Australia in about October 1997 by a Spanish
citizen, one Julian Delprado, also
known as Montero.  He said he had joined the vessel in Cuba in January 1998,
and sailed it to
Bonaire in the Netherlands Antilles and then on to Colon in
Panama.  While in Panama, it was taken over  by Flavel for about a week.
 The
prisoner knew that the Boston whaler would be exchanged for another whaler in
which the cocaine would be secreted, but he did
not know where the vessel was
taken for that purpose.  After its return, he set sail for Australia.
<P>

15  	He remained in contact with Flavel during the voyage, meeting
him in Tonga and in the Galapagos Islands and speaking to him
by telephone.
Repairs had to be made during the voyage as a result of breakages, and also as
a result of the consequences of a lightening
strike in port before the vessel
had left Panama.  Gonzales, he understood, had previously been an owner of the
"Maieva".  He had
been given a telephone number by Flavel through which he
could contact her upon his arrival.
<P>

16  	He acknowledged being aware that he was bringing cocaine into
Australia but he said that he had no idea of the quantity involved.
 He
acknowledged that he and Flavel had been transporting drugs for about four
years, and that he had made five or six such trips
from the Caribbean to Spain.
On each occasion, cocaine was concealed within a Boston whaler carried aboard
the vessel used.  He had
received various sums for these trips which had been
paid into his bank account.  
<P>

17  	Somewhat naively but consistently with his dependent
personality, he said in the course of these interviews that he had rationalised
his behaviour on the basis that he was involved, not in drug smuggling, but in
smuggling currency and/or gold.  The crew he had recruited
in Panama, he said,
knew nothing of the drugs.  So far as they were aware, the voyage was entirely
innocent, the purpose being to
ferry the yacht to Australia for a refit and
resale.  When interviewed, each member of the crew confirmed that to be the
case.  They
were not charged.
<P>

18  	The prisoner, who is a 25-year-old unmarried male citizen of the
Republic of South Africa, gave considerably more information,
as to his own
background and the offence in an extensive debriefing by the Australian Federal
Police, conducted over a period of
twenty days or so.  This followed his
agreement to assist the authorities in providing information concerning the
organisation for
which he had been working and in undertaking to give evidence
for the Crown in the prosecution of his co-accused.  This information
has been
disseminated, where appropriate, to cooperating law enforcement agencies.
<P>

19  	The induced statement into which the information has been
reduced shows that, after leaving school with the equivalent of the
Higher
School Certificate, the prisoner served 12 months as a conscript in the South
African navy, carrying out duties as a quartermaster.
 After a further 15
months working in South Africa in the automotive repair and hospitality
industries, and also for a while with
the Department of Mineral and Energy
Affairs, he spent a year or so travelling and living an alternative lifestyle
in the Pacific
and the Caribbean.  While travelling in the Caribbean and
attempting to make ends meet, he came into contact with Flavel, who introduced
himself as a professional captain who chartered and ferried boats for owners in
the Caribbean and other waters.  A close  friendship
developed and Flavel
eventually recruited him to sail with him to Spain in late 1993 as crew in a
vessel "The Seabird".  This voyage
he subsequently realised had been a drug
run, although he was unaware of it at the time.
<P>

20  	It was at the end of this voyage, for which he was paid
$US1,500, that he met Julian Delprado for the first time. It was the
precursor
to the six subsequent crossings he made from the Caribbean to Spain on the
vessels "Seabird: and "Kudra".  After several
such voyages he learned that they
were drug runs, the modus operandi for which was the same insofar as Flavel
took the whaler or
tender of the vessel away for a short time by himself before
they set sail.  On each of those occasions he had returned with a replacement
whaler into which the cocaine had been concealed.  That whaler was then
discharged at the port and marinas of arrival, stripped of
cocaine and returned
or replaced.
<P>

21  	Initially the prisoner's role was that of associate, chauffer,
assistant and/or companion for Flavel, work to which he was
no doubt drawn by
his sense of adventure, his youth and the culture of those who frequent the
ports and marinas of the Mediterranean,
Caribbean and similar places.  However,
as time progressed his responsibilities increased to the point where he was
placed in command
of one such vessel. Before his first voyage as captain, he
was informed that all expenses would be paid by Delprado, and he was given
a
contact telephone number in the United States in case of problems as well as a
contact number for Delprado in Spain.  He was instructed
as to the manner in
which he could present himself as a legitimate professional boat captain,
employed to ferry a yacht to Spain,
and how to deal with any problems
encountered with Customs, Immigration or other government agencies.
<P>

22  	Prior to the voyage that became the subject of these
proceedings, the prisoner was given a number of instructions in Cuba by
Gonzales whom he knew as Chequi.  She and her husband Carlos had been the
owners of the "Maieva" which, it seems, was purchased from
them for this
voyage.  She provided a telephone number of a woman Gloria, in Columbia, that
he was to use if he wished to contact
Delprado.  She accompanied him, along
with Carlos, for the first leg of the voyage from Cuba to Benaire.  Gloria
contacted him while
he was in port in Benaire and informed him that Delprado
would be meeting him there.  When Delprado arrived, he offered the prisoner
$400,000 to make the run.  The prisoner said that he was prepared to do it for
$300,000 to $350,000, a significant sum but one which
no doubt represents a
very small proportion of the anticipated profits had the cocaine been safely
delivered into Australia and placed
into the market.
<P>

23  	I have outlined the circumstances disclosed in the induced
statement, not in order to sentence the prisoner for the other offences
which
he may have committed or in aggravation of his criminality in respect of the
offence to which he stands for sentence.  The
material so disclosed is relevant
only insofar as it throws light on where the prisoner stood in the hierarchy of
the organisation
involved in this importation, insofar as it might help to
explain how it was that he became involved in it, and insofar as it shows
his
state of knowledge.  Additionally, of course, it is highly relevant as a
subjective matter concerning an assessment of the value
of his assistance to
the authorities.  The information I have recorded is necessarily a brief
summary of a very complete disclosure
in relation to the various voyages
undertaken, and the people involved. 
<P>

24  	The use of a statement of this kind is subject to the
restrictions noted in <b>Raz</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 6
November 1992).  It was here relied upon by the prisoner as throwing light on
his subjective
criminality, and particularly in relation to his offer of
assistance.  
<P>

25  	I am satisfied, upon the evidence placed before me, that the
prisoner's objective criminality on this occasion was very substantial.
 He was
in no doubt as to what he was carrying.  Having regard to the number of voyages
that he had undertaken, the personnel and
modus operandi involved, the amounts
of money that he had been receiving and was offered for this voyage, and the
fact that threats
had earlier been made to him to maintain his loyalty and
silence, he must have realised that he had become involved in an international
narcotics operation of considerable magnitude.  
<P>

26  	His criminality exceeded that of the person traditionally
employed as a courier to bring in relatively small amounts of narcotics
on his
or her person. This was a major drug run into which he had walked with his eyes
open.  Having regard to the responsibility
which he accepted to organise a
crew, to take command of the vessel, to ferry it and its cargo across the
Pacific, to liaise with
the principals on the way and to effect its delivery
into Australia, he occupied a rung that was above that of a mere courier.  It
was, however, short of a mid level executive or organiser.  That role fell to
those who made the arrangements for the acquisition
of the cocaine, its
delivery to him and its ultimate distribution upon behalf of those at the top
of the organisational tree.
<P>

27  	He was however, on any view, an indispensable part of this
operation.  Without the willingness of a person such as himself
to exercise the
skills needed for a long sea voyage and to take the risk of detection,
importations of this kind could not occur.
 The significance of that factor has
long been recognised, in sentencing couriers as well as in sentencing those
placed in more senior
levels of responsibility.  Although not principals, those
persons must expect significant penalties because of the imperative for
a
strong element of personal and general deterrence, it being accepted that if
starved of such persons, cartels such as those behind
this operation will
collapse.  See <b>Le Cerf</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%208%20ALR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 8 ALR 349</a> at 351,<b> Laurentiu</b> (1992)
(63  Crim R 402, and <b>Thiagarajah</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2041%20A%20Crim%20R%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 41 A Crim R 45</a> at 49.
<P>

28  	I return to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner and in
particular to the matters which I am required by s 16A of the<b> Crimes Act</b>
<b>1914 (Cth)</b> to take into account.
<P>

29  	But for his involvement in narcotics, the prisoner is not a
person who has revealed himself to be one of innate criminality.
 I believe
that after this experience he is unlikely to reoffend.  His elder sister, who
came from South Africa to give evidence,
described him as a person who is
generally law-abiding and supportive of his family. There was also tendered a
reference from the
proprietor of a construction company which had employed him
as a Project  Manager in South Africa during 1997.  He was described
in this
reference as a responsible employee who had displayed honesty, integrity and a
capacity to manage staff.  
<P>

30  	While these matters do point to his good prior character, at
least in those respects other than that with which brings him
before this
court, that is a matter of limited moment for offences of the kind with which I
am now concerned.  That is, for the reasons
explained in<b> Leroy</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20NSWLR%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2
NSWLR 441</a> at 466-467,<b> Ferrer-Esis</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2055%20A%20Crim%20R%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 55 A Crim R 231</a> at 238,<b>
Chai</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 153</a> at 201, and<b> Smith</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal
New South Wales 20 August 1998).
<P>

31  	The fact that the prisoner will be required to serve a sentence
separated from his family in a country, that is not his own,
is similarly of
limited relevance, since this is but part and parcel of the risk that those who
run drugs internationally must be
taken to accept,<b> Bushell</b> (Court of
Criminal Appeal New South Wales 17 July 1998).  The prisoner has no dependents
and the only hardship of any moment, that
his family might suffer, relates to
the expense that they may incur in travelling to Australia from South Africa to
see him while
he remains here in custody.
<P>

32  	Subject to one matter, there are no features of his background,
age, means or physical or mental condition that call for particular
attention.
The one exception relates to the conclusion reached by Mr Ferrier, following
psychometric assessment, that he has a dependent
personality to the point of a
personality disorder which makes him easily led and likely to look to others
for guidance.  This opinion
was said by his sister to sit very well with her
own assessment of him, and with the fact that, due to the death of his mother
when
he was quite young and the number of relationships in which his father, a
man apparently of a somewhat rigid personality, became
involved, the prisoner
as the youngest of four siblings, was deprived of the emotional support or the
parental guidance he needed.
 
<P>

33  	This goes some of the way, at least, to explain why he took up
with Flavel.  That man seems to have emerged as something of
a mentor to him
and a ticket to an exciting lifestyle, albeit one with a dangerous price tag
attached to it.  It also explains why
he returned to take command of the
"Maeva", even though he wished to break from this form of work and spent much
of 1997 in lawful
activities in South Africa.
<P>

34  	Mr Ferrier also thought that the prisoner appeared to be
depressed and anxious due to his present predicament. That is entirely
understandable and so long as it is kept under review, it does not call for any
particular consideration.
<P>

35  	The other matters I have outlined, however, are of relevance for
an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation, which I
accept are generally
favourable.  He has skills as a seaman, in building and in repair work.
Although his conviction is likely to
create something of a barrier to further
international travel, there is no reason to suppose that he cannot return to
gainful and
lawful work in South Africa and possibly elsewhere.
<P>

36  	For the purposes of s 16(A)(2)(j) of the Act I state that in
this regard I am satisfied that the prisoner's experience to date
and the
sentence that must be imposed  upon him will have a significant deterrent
effect.
<P>

37  	The prisoner is entitled to a considerable discount for the fact
of his plea of guilty which was entered at the first moment:<b> Winchester</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2058%20A%20Crim%20R%20345" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 58 A Crim R 345</a> and<b> Kogelbauer</b> 54  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2065%20A%20Crim%20R%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 65 A Crim R 357.</a>  In
that regard it is the fact that, but for the admissions made on his arrest, it
would have been exceedingly difficult, although
not necessarily impossible, for
a case to have been made out against him.  The relevance of that is emphasised
in the decisions in
<b>Ellis</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20603" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 603</a> and<b> Dodd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A
Crim R 349.</a>
<P>

38  	The prisoner is also entitled to a very considerable discount
for the assistance he has given, in making a full and frank disclosure
in
relation to his activities, as well as those of his associates and in
undertaking to give evidence against those co-offenders.
 The information he
has provided has been assessed as having a very high degree of reliability, and
it has opened a very valuable
window for local and overseas law enforcement
agencies in the operations of the group for whom he worked.  So far as this
shipment
is concerned, it helps to identify some of those who are either
principals or close to holding that status.
<P>

39  	The assistance so far provided, and that promised for the
future, can only be categorised as real and of such a high order
as to attract
a very significant discount in accordance with the principles discussed in<b>
Cartwright </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 243</a> at 253.  It will mean the prisoner will
almost certainly be required to spend most, if not all, of his sentence on
protection with
the consequent hardship that this will attract.  It will also
mean that he will be in permanent danger of reprisals from those who
are
associated with the powerful and dangerous cartels which are behind the cocaine
trade.  There is no doubt that they are capable
of exerting their will and
exacting revenge in other parts of the world, and of influencing law
enforcement and other authorities
in their activities.
<P>

40  	The extent of the assistance both past and future is such that I
would discount the sentence otherwise appropriate by a factor
of 50 percent.
Although that is a considerable discount, there is a very real public interest
in encouraging people, such as the
prisoner, to assist law enforcement
authorities in their fight against those behind the drug trade.  In this
respect I have had regard
to the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal
in<b> Chu</b> (16 October 1998),<b> Behar</b> (14 October 1998) and<b> Raz</b>
(17 December 1992).  In those decisions it was noted that the discount,
currently given in this State for assistance, has ranged
between 20 and 50
percent of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed.  The present case
ranks at the top end of the range in
this regard.  It seems to me that it is
appropriate for the greater proportion of that discount to be extended to the
future assistance,
because of its potential utility in the extradition and
prosecution of the co-offenders and in the possible recovery of the proceeds
of
this offence and of similar offences committed by them.
<P>

41  	I accept that by his plea, by his offer of assistance  and by
his evidence before me, the prisoner has demonstrated real contrition
for the
offence, although I also note that he walked into it with his eyes open.  There
are no other matters specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(A)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1914</a> (Cth)
that the prisoner can call in aid in reduction of his sentence.  
<P>

42  	As I have observed, the maximum penalty prescribed for the
offence of which he has been convicted is imprisonment for life.
 I am
satisfied for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s17a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17A</a> of the Act, in the light of the maximum
prescribed penalty, that the present offence can only be dealt with by way of a
sentence
of imprisonment.  The reason for that lies in the seriousness of the
present offence, and in the fact that it is an offence that
calls for a
substantial component of personal as well as general deterrence for all those
who are minded to bring into this country
the narcotic substances that are so
destructive of the community and particularly of its young.
<P>

43  	The quantity of cocaine here involved was enormous as is
witnessed by its estimated street value.  Further, it might be expected
that,
had it reached the market place, it would have generated very significant sums
of money that would then have been unlawfully
laundered and repatriated out of
this country to those behind this evil combine.  The prisoner, of course, is
not responsible for
that aspect of the venture, but it is inevitably the fact
that the unlawful proceeds of the crime would have been laundered and
repatriated
from this country.
<P>

44  	Having regard only to the objective circumstances of the matter,
this is a case which would in my view properly attract, for
a person occupying
the position of the prisoner in the importation, a sentence of imprisonment in
the order of thirty years.  In
coming to that conclusion I have had regard, in
particular, to the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in<b> Ng,</b> 25
July 1991,<b> Tan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1995%2078%20A%20Crim%20R%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1995 78 A Crim R 300</a>,<b> Wah</b> 13 April 1995<b> Tamaya
and Martinez</b> 24 November 1995,<b> Lara Gomez</b> 24 April 1996 as well as
the decision in <b> Wangsaimas</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2082%20A%20Crim%20R%20530" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 82 A Crim R 530.</a>
<P>

45  	In fact, that last-mentioned case is one that bears a degree of
similarity to the present case in terms of objective criminality,
insofar as
the offender had been employed as the captain of a vessel that had brought 89
kgs of pure heroin, having a street value
in the order of $300m into this
country.  He had pleaded guilty but had not provided any assistance.  He and
two others who had been
entrusted with the shipping of the drug, and its
delivery upon arrival in Australia, were each sentenced to life imprisonment.
Upon
appeal those sentences were upheld, although non-parole periods previously
refused had been fixed.  In the case of the captain of
the vessel, that was for
a period of 22 years.
<P>

46  	I have also had regard to the very helpful review undertaken by
Hulme J in<b> Spiteri</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20NSW%20CCA%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSW CCA 3</a>, of cases involving the importation
of heroin in quantities well in excess of the commercial quantity applicable
for those substances.
 Although only a few of those cases involved shipments of
a quantity of drugs exceeding or approaching  the quantity in the present
case,
they do show that the sentencing range, for an offence of this kind, is
particularly severe for those occupying levels of significant
responsibility.
Life sentences to which section 66G does not apply,<b> Lee Vanit</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20190%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 190
CLR 378)</a> but for which a non-parole period is to be fixed, or sentences of
imprisonment in excess of 25 years to which section 16G does apply,
are
realities for those who are involved in the  large scale importation of
narcotics.
<P>

47  	From that starting point, I observe that section 16G of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> requires adjustment to the head sentence, as well as to any
non-parole period that is set in relation to it, so as to allow for the
absence
of any system of remissions in this State (see<b> El Karhani</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21
NSWLR 370</a> and <b>Robertson</b> Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 6
November 1998).
<P>

48  	The sentence, as adjusted for that factor, needs to be further
adjusted to allow for all of the remaining favourable subjective
circumstances
I have mentioned, but most particularly, those relating to the assistance past
and future for which the discount previously
mentioned is appropriate, and also
for the early plea of guilty of the prisoner.  In giving effect to those
adjustments, however,
I observe that the process is not to be reduced to a
precise exercise in mathematics.  Sentencing does not permit of such a
structured
approach (see<b> Budiman</b> Court of Criminal Appeal New South
Wales September 1999) and <b>Lett</b> 27 March 1995.  Moreover, several of the
subjective factors identified in this case have an overlapping effect.  To give
each its
full weight in turn could lead to a sentence which does not reflect
the true criminality of the offender, and may well result in
one which does not
comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s16a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16A(1)</a> and 2(K) of the Act.
<P>

49  	In the end, the sentence must be one which ensures that the
prisoner is adequately punished, and which is not so far out of
touch with the
circumstances of the case as to constitute an affront to the community (see<b>
Gallagher </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2053%20A%20Crim%20R%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 53 A Crim R 218</a> and<b> Pang</b>(1991) CCA 4).
<P>

50  	Making proper allowance for the subjective factors pertinent to
this exceptional case, I have reached the conclusion that the
sentence should
be one of imprisonment for 10 years, to date from 7 December 1998 and that a
non-parole period should be set of 6
years to commence from the same date.  In
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s21e.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 21E</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1914</a> (Cth) I specify that, but
for the undertaking to give future assistance, the sentence would have been one
of imprisonment for 16
years, with a non-parole period of 12 years.
<P>

51  	Accordingly, I sentence you, Gregory Paul Meggett, to
imprisonment for 10 years to date from 7 December 1998.  I fix a non-parole
period of 6 years to date from the same date.  The earliest date on which you
will be eligible for release on parole will be 6 December
2004.
<P>

52  	I am bound to explain to you what the effect of the sentence is.
It means that you will serve a minimum term of imprisonment
of six years before
being eligible for release on parole, which release would be available for a
period of up to a further four years.
 Neither of those periods is subject to
any further reduction for remissions.  That reduction has already been taken
into account
by me in  fixing the periods which would otherwise have been
appropriate for your offence.  It may well be that after six years you
will be
deported but if not, you may be released on parole.  If so that would be
subject to supervision as well as subject to various
conditions, including a
condition that you be of good behaviour. If during any period of release on
parole you reoffend or breach
any of the conditions of parole, then that parole
may be revoked, in which event you would be liable to return to prison to serve
the balance of the sentence. Alternatively, the parole may be amended to
provide a partial return or altered provisions as to the
supervision or
conditions to which you would be subject.
<P>

53  	I further inform you that if you retreat from your undertaking
to give evidence against the co-offenders, and to provide the
assistance to the
authorities that you have promised to give, then the Commonwealth Director of
Public Prosecutions will be entitled
to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal
which may then resentence you.  In so doing it will take into account the
remarks that
I have made as to what the appropriate sentence would be but for
your undertaking to assist into the future.  It will be a matter
for that court
to determine, in all the circumstances, what an appropriate substituted
sentence would be.
