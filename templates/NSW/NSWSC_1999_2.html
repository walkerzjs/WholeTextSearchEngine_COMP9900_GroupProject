<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>This litigation arises out of a performance bond obtained
by the plaintiff (the builder) and given by Citibank Limited to the defendant
(the proprietor).  The bond is in a form the general features of which are
familiar in building construction business.  The plaintiff
is not a party to
it.  The bank made itself liable to pay to the defendant sums as demanded up to
a maximum of $196,000.  There are
no reservations about the bank's liability
and, in particular, the plaintiff was not in a position to countermand payment
by the
bank.  The plaintiff would have no equity to restrain payment by the
bank at whatever time the plaintiff might apply for an injunction
against the
bank, and the bank is not a party to these proceedings.
<P>

2		The building contract of 24 March 1995 relates to the construction of the
Sea Breeze apartments at 765 Princes Highway, Blakehurst.
The contract is not
on a printed standard form but refers to "Modified Building Works Contract -
JCCB1985 without quantities."
<P>

3		Significant provisions of the contract include clause 6.11 relating to
making good defects.  Under this clause the project manager
may issue an
instruction specifying defects and the builder has to make them good promptly,
and if this is not done within a reasonable
time the proprietor may have the
defects made good by others.
<P>

4		The contract contains provisions establishing a defects liability period
which plainly has expired; the period is fixed by reference
to clauses 6.11.06
and 9.11 and Fifth Schedule item F at fifty-two weeks from practical
completion.  Clause 9.9 contains provisions
which establish when practical
completion occurs.  The evidence has not established the actual date exactly
but there have been assertions
on both sides which mean that it occurred at
some time in December 1995 and the defects liability period of fifty-two weeks
expired
at some time in December 1996.  The defendant has stated that 23
December 1998 was the third anniversary of practical completion.
 Although this
was in difference between the parties to the point that cross-examination was
directed to the plaintiff's difficulties
in establishing exactly when it
occurred, the overall positions of the parties to which I have earlier referred
establish that practical
completion occurred in December 1995.
<P>

5		Clause 9.11 operating with the findings I have already made and the
provisions of item F establish that any defects liability
period which may be
relevant expired in December 1996.
<P>

6		By clause 6.11.06 the project manager may by notice to the builder fix a
second defects liability period and there was a limited
time during which the
second defects liability period so fixed would operate.  The plaintiff's case
is to the effect no second defects
liability period was ever fixed, so that
there was never any extension of the defects liability period in any way.  The
defendant's
position is to the effect that there was an extension by virtue of
references to the second defects liability period in the defendant's
letter to
the plaintiff of 21 June 1998.  The significant references are in the second
paragraph of that letter although the whole
letter should be taken together.
In my understanding of the letter it does no more than refer to the possibility
of a second defects
liability period being fixed.  No effectual step was taken
by that letter.  I conclude on the evidence generally that no step was
taken in
any way to extend the defects liability period.
<P>

7		The security deposit was referred to in the contract in ways which did not
establish altogether satisfactorily how it was to
be dealt with.  The rights
conferred on the defendant by the terms of the bank's performance bond are for
practical purposes absolute
but the terms of the performance bond do not
establish as between the parties to the building contract in what circumstances
the
proprietor may resort to the performance bond.  That must be established by
the terms of the building contract and not otherwise.
<P>

8		Clause 10.20 "Security to be provided by the builder" provides:  "The
builder shall provide security to the amount calculated
in accordance with item
Q1 of the appendix as the amount of security for the due performance of his
obligations under this agreement
...".
<P>

9		Item Q1 provides for two amounts:  under Q1A, two and a half per cent of the
contract sum to be released on practical completion
and under item Q1B another
two and a half per cent of the contract sum as security to be released on
expiration of defects liability
period or periods.  This is the amount which
gives rise to this litigation.
<P>

10		Clause 10.21 relates to the form of security.  Clause 10.21A is entitled
"Release of parties' securities."  For the amount in
item Q1A provision was
made for release on practical completion or by reference to practical
completion and the availability of a
s 172 certificate.  In some way this
amount was released.  The amount in item Q1B is dealt with thus:
<P>

	<i>"The security shall be released as follows;</i>
<P>

<i>	(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(b) As to the amounts specified in item Q1B</i>
<P>

<i>	    of the appendix on the expiration of the</i>
<P>

<i>	    defects liability period or any second</i>
<P>

<i>	    defects liability period or periods affixed</i>
<P>

<i>	    pursuant to cl 6.11.06."</i>
<P>

11		A clause 10.25 appears as a matter of form in the document with the heading
"Conversion and availability of security" but the
heading is followed by this:
"(Not applicable)".  On a pitilessly literal reading this I suppose could be
understood to mean that
conversion and availability to the proprietor of the
security are not applicable to this contract.  This cannot be the correct
reading
when the whole context is considered, as it is quite clear there was to
be security and if there was to be a security it was to be
there for some
purpose.  The probable effect of clause 10.25 is that the parties decided that
some standard form of a clause dealing
with that subject was not to be used.
<P>

12		Clause 11.10 "Release of security" provides "The security will be released
in accordance with clause 10.21A."
<P>

13		The plaintiff's contention is to the effect that clause 10.21A(b) operating
together with clause 11.10 has the effect that the
plaintiff had a contractual
right to the release of the security at the expiration of the defects liability
period in December 1996.
 The plaintiff contends that this right has continued
unimpaired because no second defects liability period has ever been fixed.
<P>

14		There is some difficulty about understanding these provisions together as
they seem to contemplate that the opportunity might
be held open to the
defendant over some period of time to fix several defects liability periods and
that the security would remain
available during that period.  However on the
facts as determined by me earlier no further defects liability period has been
fixed.
<P>

15		The plaintiff it appears to me has a very strong prima facie case to the
effect that it has a contractual entitlement either
to restoration of the item
Q1B security or to its being left untouched unless and until there has been
some event which fixes a second
defects liability period.
<P>

16		The performance bond should in my understanding be conceived of as a piece
of property in the nature of a deposit in the bank
which the plaintiff has
subjected to a mortgage or pledge in favour of the defendant.  The plaintiff is
entitled to protections of
kinds available to mortgagors in respect of the
security and, in particular, is entitled to be protected against action taken
by
the defendant as mortgagee against the plaintiff's property in circumstances
where such action is not authorised by the agreement
which created the
pledge.
<P>

17		The plaintiff's case that the calling up by the defendant of the security
deposit on 23 December 1998 followed by actually collecting
the proceeds on 24
December was in breach of the plaintiff's contractual and property rights is a
very strong prima facie case. 

<P>

18		The plaintiff claims today an interlocutory order in terms of claim 4 in
the summons, an order pending resolution of the proceedings
that the proceeds
of the undertaking be placed into a joint account with Citibank Limited in the
names of the solicitors for the
parties.  Evidence produced by the defendant
shows that the defendant cannot literally comply with an order in those terms.
The defendant's
evidence shows that Mr John Gerathy a director of the defendant
attended at the office of the bank on the afternoon of 24 December
and
collected a bank cheque drawn in favour of the defendant for $196,000, and that
then the cheque was not deposited in the defendant's
account but was endorsed
to Davlon Management Pty Limited and handed to Peter Londish, an officer of
that company.  The defendant's
allegation is that payment was made to Davlon
Management Pty Limited in payment of fees due to that company.  The defendant's
evidence
would also show that forthwith and out of the proceeds Davlon
disbursed money, not necessarily the whole of the proceeds, and in
particular
made two payments of $70,000 and $80,000 which on the probabilities (and Mr
John Gerathy is not in Australia and not able
to explain the circumstances)
appear to have been paid to him.  A further payment of $20,000 was made but the
payee is not identified.
<P>

19		At practical completion there were many defects and lengthy schedules of
defects, and some indications of the difficulties in
dealing with them appear
in the schedules in Exhibit 1.  From their number and the time taken to deal
with them it is not surprising
that the defendant should have the view that it
is entitled to make some claim in respect of them.  However claims specifically
that
the plaintiff should perform work to rectify defects had come down by 23
December to a very small matter which would not possibly
have justified the
appropriation of $196,000 or any sum of that kind.  Four defects are referred
to in the correspondence of 22 and
23 December 1998.  It is conceivable that it
might cost some thousands of dollars to do the work but quite impossible that
it would
cost anything like $196,000.  The plaintiff's National Contracts
Manager Mr Davey took the position and maintained under cross-examination
on
information and belief that the work referred to in that correspondence had
been completed on 24 December, but in my judgment
on the limited evidence
available it is not probable that all of the work was performed on or by 24
December.
<P>

20		On the views I have already expressed, the defendant no longer had any
entitlement to security on 23 and 24 December.  However
if there were such an
entitlement it is not at all clear that resort to the security would be limited
to the cost of work to rectify
defects.  It seems possible and reasonably open
to argument that the security is available for protection of the defendant in
respect
of claims for general damages.  I leave this question to one side and
express no opinion on it.
<P>

21		There are aspects of the way in which the defendant has proceeded which
lend emphasis to the need for interlocutory protection.
 One is the absence of
any notice given by the defendant of its intention to call up the security.
The defendant sent a fax message
to the plaintiff on 23 December indicating
that that would be done and proceeded forthwith to do it by sending a director
to attend
at the bank the same day and require payment.  Then this action was
completed the following day by collecting the cheque.  The letter
of 23
December did not in any way specify what were the claims against which $196,000
was to be collected, except in the most general
terms by saying "We confirm our
previous advices that Savday has incurred, as a result of Fletcher's default,
direct costs of approximately
$200,000.00.  In respect of these costs we
propose to call in the Bank Guarantee ....".
<P>

22		In relation to parties who had had a contractual relationship for some
years it is disturbing that there was that there was
no effectual notice or
clear statement of what were seen as the grounds supporting the action.  The
chain of events must have been
very surprising to the plaintiff in view of the
communications then proceeding, the latest being the fax message of 22 December
1998
which while complaining in appropriately strong terms about the state of
the work to rectify the remaining defects, gave no indication
that there would
be action to call up a large sum the following day.
<P>

23		Then there is the fact that having collected the cheque the defendant did
not deposit it in its own account or handle it through
its own organisation,
but immediately endorsed it to another company which equally immediately
disbursed the proceeds in part to
one of the principals of the defendant, and
he left the country shortly thereafter.
<P>

24		In my view these circumstances support the making of an interlocutory order
of the kind which the plaintiff seeks.
<P>

25		The substance of the matter is that the plaintiff has shown a strong prima
facie case to the effect that the defendant has alienated
its property in
circumstances where the defendant had no right to do so.  The plaintiff's claim
for an interlocutory injunction requires
not exactly restoration of the
property but placing of that property or an equivalent sum in a safe place
pending the decision of
the litigation, and this is a claim which I ought to
accede to.
<P>

26		The defendant having disposed the proceeds and created difficulties for
itself, given the apparent circumstances of its lack
of right to collect the
money at all, does not appear to me to have much claim for allowance of time or
consideration of its difficulties
or inconvenience.  The defendant has shown
itself capable of very rapid action in handling money and I should attribute to
it much
the same facility with respect to compliance with my order.
<P>

27	I make the following orders:
<P>

	Upon the plaintiff by counsel giving to the Court the usual undertaking as to
damages,
<P>

	I order that forthwith the defendant deposit the sum of $196,000 in a joint
account with Citibank Limited in the names of Pamela
Margaret Jack and Ann
Marie Bowen.
<P>

	The costs of the application for an interlocutory order are plaintiff's costs
in the proceedings.
<P>

                                     I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-27 are
the reasons for
<P>

                                                   judgment of the Honourable
Justice John Bryson.
<P>

                                                   Dated 29 January 1999.    (H
D LEWIS)
