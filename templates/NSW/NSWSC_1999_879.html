<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - form - capacity - special damages - aggravated
damages)</b>
<P>

1   	It appears from the Statement of Claim (41 pages in length
including 18 pages of annexures) filed on 9 March 1999  that the
action for
defamation instituted thereby arises from the following circumstances.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff was the executor of his late father's estate
which included as an asset certain property at 7 Copeland Road,
Beecroft.
There resided on that property the plaintiff's intellectually impaired sister,
Diedre.  In his capacity as executor of
his father's estate the plaintiff
lodged a Development Application with Hornsby Shire Council with a view to
obtaining permission
for the subdivision of the land.  The plan of subdivision,
as it is to be understood from the pleaded material, made allowance for
the
continued residence of the plaintiff's sister.
<P>

3   	On 17 December 1997 a Planning Meeting at Hornsby Shire
Council took place and at approximately 1.30am on Thursday 18 December
1997
reached the item on the agenda which concerned the Development Application.  A
transcript of the sound recording of the relevant
part of the meeting dealing
with that item is appended to the Statement of Claim.  In some important
respects it is incomplete. 
In addition to the councillors, there were present
the plaintiff, his sister and a neighbour Dr Liu.  The Development Application
was the subject of discussion presumably in accordance with the rules of
procedure of the Planning Meeting.
<P>

4   	On 18 February 1998 there took place another Planning
Meeting of the Council.  A transcript of the proceedings of that meeting,
prepared, as was the first transcript, by the plaintiff, indicates that in
addition to councillors present there was another neighbour
present a Mr Kelvin
Low, as were the plaintiff, and a Mr Kevin Walsh, the estate's solicitor. 
<P>

5   	The Development Application was considered and the Council
resolved to refuse the application.
<P>

6   	The plaintiff brings the proceedings in his capacity as
executor of his father's estate and personally against five defendants
arising
from words said at the two meetings.
<P>

7   	The first defendant Mr Stephen Pringle is a counsellor and
he is sued in respect of statements attributed to him at the first
meeting on
17 December 1997.
<P>

8   	The second defendant Ms Margaret McMurray is a counsellor
and she is sued in respect of words attributed to her during that
meeting.  
<P>

9   	The third defendant, Dr Yao Chee Liu was present at the
meeting as a neighbour of the plaintiff's sister.  He is sued in respect
of
statements made by him at that first meeting. 
<P>

10   	The fourth defendant, Hornsby Shire Council, is sued in
respect of all that was published and attributed to the other defendants,
as I
understand it, at the first meeting.  The Council is also sued in respect of
the material published and attributed to Mr Kelvin
Low the fifth defendant at
the meeting on 18 February 1998.
<P>

11   	Mr Low (a neighbour), is sued in respect of what he said
at the second meeting.
<P>

12   	As I have said each defendant is sued by the plaintiff in
his personal capacity and in his capacity as executor of his father's
estate.
That second capacity constitutes the first of many <i>"complications</i>" to
which the pleading points.
<P>

13   	The imputations pleaded against each defendant are pleaded
as arising from their natural and ordinary meaning and as true
innuendos (SCR
Pt 67 r 12(c)).  That is the second complication.
<P>

14   	The third complication arises from allegations of
re-publication or partial re-publication by each defendant constituted,
as best
as I can understand it at this stage, by the recording of the respective
proceedings on tape, the deposit of that tape for
access to interested parties
and the "<i>grapevine effect".</i>
<P>

15   	The next "<i>complication</i>" is constituted by a claim
for special damage by the plaintiff in his "<i>personal capacity and as
executor of his late father's estate</i>" (paragraph 27).  This claim seems to
relate to damages said to flow from the failure by the Council to approve the
Development Application
and the loss of the opportunity to sell the lots in the
subdivision until after a fall in the Sydney real estate market, subsequent
delay and the incurring of additional professional legal and other costs. A
second component of this claim appears to be that by
reason of the refusal of
the Development Application, the plaintiff in order to carry out his duty as
executor and as the person
responsible for the application, was obliged to
neglect his own business as a cattle raiser and to place that business under
contract
management with resulting costs and expenses being incurred.
<P>

16   	The last <i>"complication</i>" (as presently perceived) is
an extraordinary claim for aggravated damages the numeration of which follows
sequentially the 3 paragraphs
under the heading "<i>Special Damage</i>".  By
"<i>extraordinary</i>" I mean that there are included among the 9
"<i>particulars</i>" matters that appear to have no relevance to this head of
claim. 
<P>

17   	In the Defamation List on 13 August 1999 Mr Connell of
counsel announced his appearance with Ms Clarke as juniors to Mr Garnsey
Q.C.
for the plaintiff;  Mr Smark announced his appearance for the first, second and
fourth defendants (the two councillors and the
Council), and Mr Gray for the
third and fifth defendants (the two neighbours).
<P>

18   	In answer to an inquiry on my part Mr Connell informed me
that Mr McDougall, the plaintiff and his wife were present in Court.
 In answer
to further inquiry as to the foundation for the institution of these
proceedings Mr Connell with due candour for his client
announced that his
client had been subjected to the defamatory imputations and humiliation at the
two public meetings of the Hornsby
Council.
<P>

19   	It has to be observed at this stage that the structure of
this litigation as it presently exists, and indeed, its very nature,
points to
massive and crippling legal costs potentially being incurred by both personal
litigants and the institutional litigant.
 Such costs are likely to be incurred
by the pursuit of technical interlocutory procedures of the kind that beset the
Defamation
List.  It is as desirable as it is essential in a case of this kind
to seek to avoid the incurring of such costs and to seek to keep
to a minimum
interlocutory arguments.  Presently, in the absence of a formalised Case
Management scheme affecting defamation actions,
the Court can have recourse to
s 76A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>,</i> SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p26" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 26</a> r 1 and SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 2 to have
separately determined questions of fact and law.  At this stage it seems to me
that as soon as possible directions should
be given under those provisions for
the determination of the issues of publication and meaning including the jury
determination of
whether in fact defamatory imputations are carried.  That
course will be aided at an appropriate time by the giving of directions
as to
interrogatories, any notices to admit or informal admissions on those subject
matters.  They will certainly be the subject
of consideration when the matter
is next listed in the Defamation List.  The parties are invited forthwith to
give consideration
to the employment of these mechanisms for the speedy
disposition of these issues.
<P>

20   	Appended to these reasons is a transcript of the tape of
each of the meetings.
<P>

<b>First Defendant (Councillor Pringle) - Imputations</b>
<P>

21   	The imputations pleaded against this defendant and the
transcript references are as follows:
<P>

<i>"4.1	That Mr Macdougall has ignored the concerns of his mentally disabled
sister and was feuding with her to disadvantage her by pursuing
a subdivision
proposal for the property in which she was living over her objections.</i>
<P>

(page 4 lines 4-7, 9-12, page 5 lines 21-24 &amp; 26-30:  in the context of
page 1 lines 1-2; page 3 lines 29-54 and page 4 line
1)
<P>

<i>4.2	That Mr Macdougall, by pursuing a subdivision proposal for the property
in which she was living over her objections, was neglecting
his mentally
disabled sister's legitimate concerns and deliberately refraining from doing
anything to meet them for his own advantage.</i>
<P>

(page 4 line <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s4</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a>; page 5 lines 21-24 &amp; 26-30; in the context of page
3 lines 29-54 and page 4 line 1)
<P>

<i>4.3	That Mr Macdougall had so conducted himself as to create and maintain a
bad relationship with his sister and did not care for
her concerns or
well-being.</i>
<P>

(page 4 lines 4-7, 9-12, page 5 lines 21-24 &amp; 26-30)
<P>

<i>4.4	That Mr Macdougall was a hypocrite.</i>
<P>

(page 12 lines 17, 21 &amp; 23)
<P>

<i><strike>4.5	That Mr Macdougall was a hypocrite because he was not a
practising Christian and had protested against the relevance of that matter
to
the consideration of his subdivision proposal before the Planning Committee of
Hornsby Shire Council.</strike></i>
<P>

(page 12 lines 5-6, 14, 21, 23; in the context of page 12 lines 7-8, 10, 18-19,
22)
<P>

<i>4.6	That Mr Macdougall was a hypocrite because he was not a practising
Christian and had said he was endeavouring to act in his sister's
interests in
pursuing his subdivision proposal for the property in which she was living when
in fact he was not endeavouring to act
in her interests.</i>
<P>

(page 12 lines 5-6, 17, 21, 23; page 4 lines 9-12;  page 5 lines 26-27, 28-29;
in the context of page 4 lines 13-21;  page 6 lines
30-34, 36-42, page 9 lines
33-36, page 10 line 18)
<P>

<i>4.7	That Mr Macdougall was not a good man because he was not a practising
Christian.</i>
<P>

(page 12 lines 5-6, 17, 21 &amp; 23)
<P>

<i>4.8	That notwithstanding Mr Macdougall was executor of his father's estate
and trustee of his father's will for the benefit of his
sister, he was
misconducting himself and failing to carry out his duties as executor and
trustee in putting forward and seeking to
have approved the sub-division
proposal before the Planning Committee of Hornsby Shire Council".</i>
<P>

(page 4 lines 4-7, 9-12, page 5 lines 21-24 &amp; 26-30:  page 12 lines 5-6,
17, 21, &amp; 23; in the context of page 1 lines 1-2;
page 3 lines 29-54 and
page 4 line 1)
<P>

22   	Imputation 4.5 has been abandoned.
<P>

23   	It is to be observed that there is a certain
"<i>sameness</i>" about imputations 4.1. 4.2 and 4.3.
<P>

24   	Particular objection is taken to 4.1 by reason of the use
of the word "<i>disadvantage</i>" insofar as it is asserted that it is
ambiguous:  does it mean the effect of what he did or that was the purpose of
what he was seeking
to achieve?
<P>

25   	As to imputation 4.2 it is said that this is a rolled up
imputation the last clause commencing "<i>and deliberately ..."</i> being a
separate charge.
<P>

26   	As to imputation 4.3, as I understand the objection, it
discloses nothing as to the "<i>conduct"</i> that created the bad relationship
and it contains (the arguably) rolled up component of lack of care.
<P>

27   	The charge of hypocrisy in imputation 4.4 is filled out in
imputation 4.6 in which is incorporated what is suggested in imputation
4.7.
<P>

28   	Imputation 4.8 is really incomprehensible though it
appears to be pointing towards a charge against the plaintiff in his capacity
as executor and trustee.  
<P>

29   	It is not for me to draft the plaintiff's imputations but
the following may go some way (and of course I do not warrant them)
to seek to
capture the different concepts as I understand the plaintiff to be striving
for:
<P>

<i>"(a)	that Mr MacDougall by pursuing over her objections a subdivision
proposal for the property in which she was living ignored the
concerns of his
mentally disabled sister.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Mr MacDougall in pursuing over her objections a subdivision proposal for
the property in which she was living was deliberately
refrain for his own
advantage from meeting his sisters concerns.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Mr MacDougall by pursuing over her objections a subdivision proposal for
the property in which she was living had created a relationship
with his sister
characterised by a lack of care on his part for her well being.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Mr MacDougall was a hypocrite".</i>
<P>

30   	Mr Pringle says the last in clear term.  It is an
imputation which arguably can stand by itself.  It might be desirable however
to plead an additional or alternative imputation to the following effect:
<P>

<i>"(e)	that Mr MacDougall was a hypocrite in that he said he was endeavouring
to act in his sister's interests in pursuing his subdivisions
proposal for the
property in which she was living but was not in fact doing so/or was acting for
his own advantage".</i>
<P>

31   	A further variation might be to the effect that:
<P>

<i>"(f)	Mr MacDougall although not professing to be a practising Christian was
still not a good man because of his pursuit, to her detriment,
over her
objection of a subdivision proposal for the property in which his mentally
disabled sister was living.</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	As executor of his father's estate and trustee of his father's will for
the benefit of his sister Mr MacDougall failed to carry
out his duties as such
in pursuing approval of the subdivision proposal contrary to the interests and
benefit of his sister".</i>
<P>

32   	Somewhere within the range of these ideas, to which I
understand the imputations to be leading, can be formulated a set which
would
be unobjectionable.
<P>

33   	Nonetheless of those pleaded the following orders will
have to be made:
<P>

34   	Imputation 4.1 is struck out as bad in form:  in my view,
it is rolled up - "<i>ignored"</i> - "<i>feuding" </i>- though I reject the
submission as to the word "<i>disadvantage</i>".
<P>

35   	Imputation 4.2 is struck out as bad in form as it is
clearly rolled up.
<P>

36   	Imputation 4.3 is struck out in failing to disclose the
"<i>conduct"</i> which is clearly available to be done.
<P>

37   	Imputation 4.4 is not struck out.  It is good in form.
<P>

38   	Imputation 4.6 I will not presently strike out provided it
is the words "<i>he was not a practising a Christian and had ..."</i> are
omitted.
<P>

39   	Imputation 4.7 I will not strike out.
<P>

40   	Imputation 4.8 I will strike out as bad in form.  It can
easily be re-worded. 
<P>

41   	Those imputations I have not struck out are capable of
arising in my view, and are capable of being defamatory.
<P>

42   	Leave to amend generally however I do grant.
<P>

<b>Second Defendant (Counsellor Margaret McMurray) - Imputations </b>
<P>

43   	The imputations pleaded against this defendant are as
follows (together with the references to the passages in the transcript
relied
upon):
<P>

<i>"8.1	That Mr Macdougall was a person without compassion for his mentally
disabled sister.</i>
<P>

(page 9 lines 33-36, 38-40; page 10 lines 1-2, 6-15, 25-26; page 11 lines 7-8;
page 12 line 14)
<P>

<i>8.2	That Mr Macdougall who was prepared to risk his mentally disabled
sister's mental health in pursuing a subdivision proposal contrary
to her
wishes.</i>
<P>

(page 9 lines 33-36, 38-40; page 10 lines 1-2, 6-7, 22-23, 25-26; see further
the particulars given as to 4.1 and 4.2 as to context)
<P>

<i>8.3	That notwithstanding that Mr MacDougall was executor of his father's
estate and trustee of his father's will, he was feuding with
his mentally
disabled sister over the benefits of their late father's estate for his own
advantage;</i>
<P>

(page 9 lines 33-36, 38-40; page 10 lines 1-2, 6-15, 22-23, 25-26; see further
the particulars given as to 4.1 and 4.2 as to context)
<P>

<i>8.4	That Mr MacDougall, in pursuing a subdivision proposal for the property
in which his mentally disabled sister was living and over
her objections was a
person who had no concern for the happiness of his mentally disabled
sister;</i>
<P>

(page 9 lines 33-36, 38-40; page 10 lines 1-2, 6-7, 22-23, 25-26; see further
the particulars given as to 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 as to
context)
<P>

<i>8.5	That Mr Macdougall not a good man because he was not a practising
Christian.</i>
<P>

(page 12 line 14;  as to context see the particulars given as to 8.4 including
by way of cross-reference)
<P>

<i><strike>8.6	That Mr MacDougall's conduct concerning his mentally disabled
sister in pursuing a subdivision proposal for the property in which
she was
living over her objections was so serious, as it was not the conduct of a good
man or of a practising Christian, that it
was relevant to and should be taken
into account by the Planning Committee of Hornsby Shire Council in approving
the subdivision
proposal.</strike></i>
<P>

(page 12 line 14;  as to context see the particulars given as to 8.4 including
by way of cross-reference)
<P>

<i>8.7	That Mr Macdougall had shown such lack of compassion and preparedness to
take advantage of his mentally disabled sister that he
should be questioned as
to whether or not he was a practicing Christian and a good man.</i>
<P>

(page 12 line 14;  as to context see the particulars given as to 8.4 including
by way of cross-reference)
<P>

<i>8.8	That Mr MacDougall in rejecting an alternative subdivision plan
suggested by Councillors deliberately tried to mislead Councillors
in regard to
the topography of the site".</i>
<P>

(page 9 lines 19-28)
<P>

44   	Imputation 8.6 has been abandoned.
<P>

45   	As to imputation 8.1 it is argued on behalf of that
defendant that it is simply <i>"not there</i>".  When one considers the words
attributed to this councillor, for example at line 7 on page 10 of the
transcript of the first meeting,
it is clearly arguable.  I find imputation 8.1
capable of arising and capable of being defamatory.
<P>

46   	As to imputation 8.2 I am of a similar view.
<P>

47   	As to imputation 8.3 it will be struck out (see imputation
4.3).
<P>

48   	As to imputation 8.4 this, in my view, captures the
substance of imputations 8.1 and 8.2 and I strike it out as contravening
SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p67" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
67</a> r 11(3).
<P>

49   	As to imputation 8.5 this councillor joined in the
proposition implicit in the question asked by Councillor Pringle.  She
should
be "<i>pinned</i>" to the same imputation.  It will go to the jury.
<P>

50   	As to imputation 8.7 this captures the substance, in my
view, of 8.1 and 8.2 and 8.5.  I strike it out accordingly.
<P>

51   	Imputation 8.8 is founded on a part of what is alleged to
have been said but not recorded on the tape or in the transcript
namely, lines
27 and 28 on page 9.  On the assumption that the plaintiff in the end can prove
publication of these words I am of
the view that the imputation is capable of
arising and that the sting of "<i>misleading"</i> is available from the words
"<i>I can read a map too, you know"</i>.  Imputation 8.8 will go to the
jury.
<P>

<b>Third Defendant (Dr Liu) - Imputations </b>
<P>

52   	The imputations pleaded against this defendant are as
follows:
<P>

<i>"12.1	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate was
deliberately
acting to disadvantage his mentally disabled sister in pursuing the subdivision
proposal against her wishes.</i>
<P>

<i>12.2	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate, by
pursuing a
subdivision proposal for the property in which she was living over her
objections, was acting so unreasonably and improperly
to disadvantage his
sister as to require her to be protected against him.</i>
<P>

<i>12.3	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate, was
deliberately
pursuing a proposal for subdivision over her objections and acting so as to
have a devastating effect on her mental
health and to be likely to cause her to
have a mental breakdown.</i>
<P>

<i>12.4	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate, was
failing to carry
out his proper duties as executor and was acting to disadvantage his sister who
was one of the beneficiaries of
the estate".</i>
<P>

53   	The plaintiff relies upon the words attributed to this
defendant on pages 3 to 4 and 8 to 9 of the transcript of the first
meeting.
<P>

54   	It is to be borne in mind that the plaintiff is suing the
defendant in respect of the words uttered by him at the meeting
and relies upon
the imputations arising from the natural and ordinary meanings in the first
instance.  The primary submission for
this defendant is nothing in what Dr Liu
says is capable of referring to the plaintiff as executor and trustee of his
father's will.
 There is reference to the deceased estate;  there is reference
to the father.  There is reference to Diedre being a beneficiary.
 I agree with
this proposition.  I do not however agree with the proposition that there is
nothing in what Dr Liu is alleged to have
said that give rises to imputation
12.1 omitting the reference to the executor.  One wonders why there is a
reference by the use
of the word "<i>notwithstanding ... he was executor</i>"
at all.  Be that as it may, Dr Liu does refer to Diedre never having been
consulted.  It is implicit in my view, that that which
is being proposed is
contrary to her wishes.  Imputation 12.1 is incapable of arising.  The
plaintiff has liberty to replead.
<P>

55   	In relation to imputation 12.2 the elimination of the
reference to the plaintiff being the executor would cure this defect
and an
imputation in appropriate form will be allowed as arising and as capable of
being defamatory.  Formally, imputation 12.2 is
found as not capable of being
conveyed.
<P>

56   	Imputation 12.3 again omitting the reference to the
executor is capable of arising by reference to the passage not recorded
but
attributed to Dr Liu in relation to the danger to the mental health of the
plaintiff's sister.  I find however that in its present
form imputation 12.3 is
incapable of being conveyed.
<P>

57   	As to imputation 12.4 I strike this imputation out as bad
in form as not disclosing that which constitutes the alleged failure
to carry
out the proper duties as executor.  In any event, by reason of my holding that
there is no reference to the plaintiff as
executor (in fact there is no
reference to the plaintiff by name at all), an imputation along these lines is
simply incapable of
being conveyed.
<P>

58   	The plaintiff has leave to replead the imputations against
this defendant.
<P>

<b>Fourth Defendant (Hornsby Shire Council) - Imputations</b>
<P>

59   	The imputations pleaded against the Council are as
follows:
<P>

<i>"16.1	That Mr Macdougall had ignored the concerns of his mentally disabled
sister and was feuding with her to disadvantage her by
pursuing a subdivision
proposal for the property in which she was living over her objections.</i>
<P>

<i>16.2	That Mr Macdougall, by pursuing a subdivision for the property in which
she was living over her objections, was neglecting his
mentally disabled
sister's legitimate concerns and deliberately refraining from doing anything to
meet them for his own advantage.</i>
<P>

<i>16.3	That Mr Macdougall had so conducted himself as to create and maintain a
bad relationship with his sister and did not care for
her concerns or
well-being.</i>
<P>

<i>16.4	That Mr Macdougall was a hypocrite.</i>
<P>

<i><strike>16.5	That Mr Macdougall was a hypocrite because he was not a
practising Christian and had protested against the relevance of that
matter to
the consideration of his subdivision proposal before the Planning Committee of
Hornsby Shire Council.</strike></i>
<P>

<i>16.6	That Mr Macdougall was a hypocrite because he was not a practising
Christian and had said he was endeavouring to act in his sister's
interests in
pursuing his subdivision proposal for the property in which she was living when
in fact he was not endeavouring to act
in her interests.</i>
<P>

<i>16.7	That Mr Macdougall was not a good man because he was not a practising
Christian.</i>
<P>

<i>16.8	That notwithstanding Mr Macdougall was executor of his father's estate
and trustee of his father's will for the benefit of his
sister, he was
misconducting himself and failing to carry out his duties as executor and
trustee in putting forward and seeking to
have approved the sub-division
proposal before the Planning Committee of Hornsby Shire Council.</i>
<P>

<i>16.9	That Mr Macdougall was a person without compassion for his mentally
disabled sister.</i>
<P>

<i>16.10	That Mr Macdougall was prepared to risk his mentally disabled sister's
mental health in pursuing a subdivision proposal contrary
to her wishes.</i>
<P>

<i>16.11	That notwithstanding that Mr MacDougall was executors of his father's
estate and trustee of his father's will, he was feuding
with his mentally
disabled sister over the benefits in their late father's estate for his own
advantage.</i>
<P>

<i>16.12	That Mr MacDougall, in pursuing a subdivision proposal for the
property in which his mentally disabled sister was living and
over her
objections, was a person who had no concern for the happiness of his mentally
disabled sister.</i>
<P>

<i><strike>16.13	That Mr MacDougall's conduct concerning his mentally disabled
sister in pursuing a subdivision proposal for the property in
which she was
living over her objections was so serious, as it was not the conduct of a good
man or of a practising Christian, that
it was relevant to and should be taken
into account by the Planning Committee of Hornsby Shire Council in considering
the subdivision
proposal</strike>.</i>
<P>

<i>16.14	That Mr Macdougall had shown such lack of compassion and preparedness
to take advantage of his mentally disabled sister that
he should be questioned
as to whether or not he was a practicing Christian and a good man.</i>
<P>

<i>16.15	That Mr MacDougall, in rejecting an alternative subdivision plan
suggested by Councillors, deliberately tried to mislead Councillors
in regard
to the topography of the site.</i>
<P>

<i>16.16	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate was
deliberately
acting to disadvantage his mentally disabled sister in pursuing the subdivision
proposal against her wishes.</i>
<P>

<i>16.17	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate, by
pursuing a
subdivision proposal for the property in which she was living over her
objections, was acting so unreasonably and improperly
to disadvantage his
sister as to require her to be protected against him.</i>
<P>

<i>16.18	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate, was
deliberately
pursuing a proposal for subdivision over her objections and acting so as to
have a devastating effect on her mental
health and to be likely to cause her to
have a mental breakdown.</i>
<P>

<i>16.19	That Mr Macdougall, notwithstanding that his sister was mentally
disabled and he was executor of his late father's estate, was
failing to carry
out his proper duties as executor and was acting to disadvantage his sister who
was one of the beneficiaries of
the estate".</i>
<P>

60   	It will be seen that in paragraph 16 of the Statement of
Claim the plaintiff has brought together the imputations arising
from the
separate publications attributable to the 3 preceding defendants.
<P>

61   	The observations I have made <i>seriatim</i> in relation
to the separately pleaded imputations must apply to these imputations and the
plaintiff will be granted leave to re-plead
conformably with the leave granted
consequent upon orders made with the preceding defendants (see below in formal
orders).
<P>

62   	The fourth defendant is also alleged to have conveyed the
imputations arising from the words attributed to the fifth defendant
Mr
MacDougall of the second meeting of the Council which took place on 18 February
1998.
<P>

<b>Fifth Defendant (Mr Kelvin Low) - Imputations</b>
<P>

63   	The imputations pleaded against this defendant are as
follows:
<P>

<i>"24.1	That Mr McDougall was ignoring his intellectually impaired sister's
best interests and mental welfare in seeking approval of
a subdivision proposal
over her objections.</i>
<P>

<i>24.2	That Mr McDougall in seeking approval of a subdivision proposal over
his intellectually impaired sister's objections which ignored
her best
interests was motivated only by a concern for financial gain as a
developer.</i>
<P>

<i>24.3	That Mr MacDougall had caused his intellectually impaired sister's
financial manager appointed by the Guardianship Board to resign
by placing
pressure on that person to deprive his sister of necessary representation of
her interests.</i>
<P>

<i>24.4	That Mr MacDougall was seeking to take advantage of the lack of a
financial guardian to pursue a subdivision proposal over his
sister's
objections to his own advantage when his sister had no appointed financial
manager to represent her.</i>
<P>

<i>24.5	That Mr MacDougall as a person who was only interested in money and his
own financial gain had no concern for and was prepared
to ignore his
intellectually impaired sister's best interests.</i>
<P>

<i>24.6	That notwithstanding Mr MacDougall was executor of his father's estate
and trustee of his father's will for the benefit of his
sister, he was
misconducting himself and failing to carry out his duties as executor and
trustee in putting forward and seeking to
have approved the subdivision
proposal before the Planning Committee of Hornsby Shire Council".</i>
<P>

64   	With respect to these imputations I find as follows:
<P>

65   	As to imputation 24.1 this is capable of arising, it is
capable of being defamatory.
<P>

66   	Imputation 24.2 is capable of arising and capable of being
defamatory.
<P>

67   	Imputation 24.3, having read the transcript and listened
to the tape, I can only conclude that it would be a morbid or suspicious
mind
that would conclude that what Mr Low is here saying is that the plaintiff
applied pressure to the financial guardian to resign.
 There is no reasonable
basis for that proposition.  Imputation 24.3 I find to be incapable of being
carried by the matter complained
of.
<P>

68   	As to imputation 24.4. this was in the course of argument
was amended to read "<i>that Mr MacDougall was seeking to take advantage of a
lack of a financial guardian".</i>  The matter complained of, in my view,
generally and particularly at lines 14 to 26 on page 2 of the tape are capable
of giving rise
to an imputation in that form.  It will go to the jury as
amended.
<P>

69   	As to imputation 24.5 it is unarguable, in my view, that
this imputation does not differ in substance from the two imputations
that I
have otherwise allowed namely imputation 24.1 and 24.2.
<P>

70   	Accordingly, imputation 24.5 is struck out.
<P>

71   	As to imputation 24.6 Mr Low makes no reference to the
plaintiff by name nor to his position as executor.  The disparaging
stings are
capable as being understood to be referring to Mr MacDougall personally.
Imputation 24.6 I find incapable of arising.
<P>

<b>Fourth Defendant (Hornsby Shire Council) - Imputations </b>
<P>

72   	The imputations pleaded against Mr Low are repleaded
against the Council in paragraph 20 of the Statement of Claim.  They
are:
<P>

<i>"20.1	That Mr MacDougall was ignoring his intellectually impaired sister's
best interest and mental welfare in seeking approval of
a subdivision proposal
over her objections.</i>
<P>

<i>20.2	That Mr MacDougall in seeking approval of a subdivision proposal over
his intellectually impaired sister's objections which ignored
her best
interests was motivated only by a concern for financial gain as a
developer.</i>
<P>

<i>20.3	That Mr MacDougall had caused his intellectually impaired sister's
financial manager appointed by the Guardianship Board to resign
by placing
pressure on that person to deprive his sister of necessary representation of
her interests.</i>
<P>

<i>20.4	That Mr MacDougall was seeking to take advantage of [the lack of a
financial guardian] to pursue a subdivision proposal over
his sister's
objections to his own advantage when his sister had no appointed financial
manager to represent her.</i>
<P>

<i>20.5	That Mr MacDougall as a person who was only interested in money and his
own financial gain had no concern for and was prepared
to ignore his
intellectually impaired sister's best interests.</i>
<P>

<i>20.6	That notwithstanding Mr MacDougall was executor of his father's estate
and trustee of his father's will for the benefit of his
sister, he was
misconducting himself and failing to carry out his duties as executor and
trustee in putting forward and seeking to
have approved the subdivision
proposal before the Planning Committee of Hornsby Shire Council".</i>
<P>

73   	Thus, the same observations that I made in respect to the
imputations pleaded against the fifth defendant Mr Low are applicable
to the
imputations pleaded against the fourth defendant in respect to the second
publication (see below in formal orders).
<P>

<b>True Innuendos</b>
<P>

74   	The plaintiff, as against each defendant, has pleaded the
imputations as "<b><i>true innuendos</i></b><i>"</i> specifying in accordance
with SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p67" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 67</a> r 12(c) the "<i>extrinsic facts</i>".
<P>

75   	The structure of the Statement of Claim is that each of
the personal defendants is sued in respect of the words attributed
to him or
her.  Those words are of course part of the taped record of the whole of the
meeting.  The fourth defendant (the Council)
is sued in respect of the
publication of the several individual parts.  There is no action based upon the
whole of the transcript
of the meeting as-it-were, thus technically it does
appear to me to be open to the plaintiff to plead as extrinsic facts the other
parts of the record of the meeting relating to what was said by other
defendants and, in addition, the whole of the record of the
meeting itself
which is, for example, specified as an extrinsic fact in paragraph 6(f).
<P>

76   	Arguably insofar as Mr MacDougall seeks to plead an
imputation defamatory of him in his capacity as executor of his father's
estate
by reason of the breach by him of some duty or obligation of that office, it
would be open to the plaintiff to plead an extrinsic
fact of the kind, for
example, set out in paragraph 6(c).  
<P>

77   	Whilst the structure in my view of the whole of the
Statement of Claim is essentially artificial and on a common sense basis
does
not accord with the reality of events of the two meetings, technically I am not
presently persuaded that the pleading in the
alternative of true innuendos is
embarrassing to the defendants.
<P>

<b>Plaintiff Suing in the Capacity as Executor</b>
<P>

78   	It seems to me curious that the plaintiff has chosen to
plead that he is suing in his capacity as executor.  Assuming the
plaintiff to
have been defamed by the publication of imputations defamatory of him
personally (for example, vis-a-vis his relationship
with his sister), or
personally in the sense that as executor of his father's estate he had
misconducted himself, any damages would
be damages "<i>personal</i>" to the
plaintiff.  The estate has not been and cannot be "<i>defamed</i>".  It may
well be that some action was available to the estate as against the Council
consequent upon the Council's refusal of the
Development Application which, I
gather, was subsequently approved in the Land &amp; Environment Court.  That
any special damages
are recoverable by Mr MacDougall must be personal to him
and must be connected with the damage done to his reputation in a personal
sense.
<P>

79   	I am not in a position conclusively to rule on this aspect
at this stage.  Indeed, it might well be a matter for the trial.
 No doubt
further and better particulars will be provided of the claim made in paragraph
27 of the Statement of Claim that "<i>as executor of his late father's
estate</i>" damage was suffered and particulars of special damage are thereupon
supplied, for example, relating to what appears to be a claimed
diminution in
the sale value of the subdivided lots consequent upon delay in the approval of
the subdivision.  That delay, at first
blush, would seem to be not so much the
result of the plaintiff being defamed but as a result of the refusal by the
Council of the
Development Application.  It happened that during the meetings
of the Council concerned with that Development Application that the
plaintiff
arguably was defamed.  But whether it necessarily follows in a logical or
requisitely causative sense that such diminution
in value is payable by the
defendants as a component of special damages for having defamed the plaintiff
is an interesting question
of principle let alone of proof.
<P>

80   	Similar considerations apply to the second component of
the claim for special damages which I understand to be particular
costs
incurred by the plaintiff in the running of his business as a cattle breeder.
It is, I gather, contended that he was obliged
to place his business under
contract management in order to pursue the subdivision application.  This will
no doubt be the subject
of further and better particulars and certainly should
be.
<P>

81   	This aspect was not argued in any great length in the
Defamation List on 13 August.  It may well be that, subject to clarification
of
the plaintiff's claim in this regard to which the defendants are clearly
entitled, a more formal and considered application can
be made in regard to
this component of Mr MacDougall's action.
<P>

<b>Particulars of Aggravated Damages</b>
<P>

82   	As I have already remarked these particulars are
extraordinary not the least in their numeration.  They are as follows:
<P>

<i>"(4)	The plaintiff is and was at all material times the executor of the
estate of his late father, Robin Ramsay Macdougall.</i>
<P>

<i>(5)	The plaintiff is and was at all material times endeavouring to carry out
the terms of the will and to administer the trusts under
the will of his late
father Robin Ramsay Macdougall.</i>
<P>

<i>(6)	The plaintiff is and was at all material times endeavouring to safeguard
protect and advance the interests of his sister Ms Deirdre
Macdougall.</i>
<P>

<i>(7)	Each of the defamatory imputations pleaded above is and was false and
untrue;</i>
<P>

<i>(8)	Each of the defamatory imputations pleaded above is and was known to the
defendant making that imputation to be false and untrue,
or alternatively was
made by the defendant recklessly, not caring whether the imputation was true or
false;</i>
<P>

<i>(9)	Each of the imputations pleaded over seriously reflected on the
character of the plaintiff as a brother, and upon the propriety
of the
plaintiff's actions as executor of the will of his late father;</i>
<P>

<i>(10)	The plaintiff's sister is and was at all material times subject to the
protection of the Protective Commissioner and suffered
from mental and
intellectual disability.</i>
<P>

<i>(11)	The plaintiff was and continues to be a fond, loving and affectionate
brother seeking to protect, safeguard and advance his late
sister's interests
and as executor of the will of his late father, and was endeavouring to carry
out the terms of the will and the
trusts under the will.</i>
<P>

<i>(12)	The plaintiff has been compelled in order to carry out his duty as
executor and as the person responsible for the subdivision
application to place
his business of an active cattle raiser at Gulargambone, NSW under contract
management in order to deal with,
manage and pursue the subdivision
application, and has incurred costs and expenses accordingly".</i>
<P>

83   	Strangely enough at page 23 of the Statement of Claim
there is a heading "<i>Particulars of Aggravated Damages - Supreme Court Rules
Part 67 r 12 ... Particulars will be provided"</i>.  What this means I do not
know.
<P>

84   	I propose to strike out particulars (4), (5), (6), (9),
(10), (11) and (12).  These on their face embarrassing:  they presently
particularise no matter that is capable of being characterised as improper,
lacking in bona fides or unjustifiable in terms of conduct
by the defendants.
The plaintiff will have to redraft the Statement of Claim in this regard and
attend carefully to the proper particularisation
of any such matters upon which
he proposes to rely in aggravation of damages so that each of the defendants
will know with clarity
what case he, she or it has to meet.  
<P>

85   	As I indicated earlier in these reasons, this is a case
where it is clearly desirable that the issue of publication and meaning
be
litigated first and at an early date.  It is desirable therefore that in regard
to those subjects the plaintiff's pleading be
put in order without delay.
Matters going to damages of course can be dealt with later.
<P>

86   	Having reviewed the balance of outcomes of the hearing on
13 August I am of the view that each party should bear its own costs.
<P>

87   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	(a)	Imputations 4.4 and 4.7 will go to the jury.
<P>

	(b)	Imputations 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.8 are struck out.

11	read the written objections from Copeland Road residents 
<P>

12	and I see that these are all from those on the western 
<P>

13	side of the existing block and there are none from the 
<P>

14	eastern side. Neighbours to the west have stated that 
<P>

15	they are not opposed to the subdivision of the land into 
<P>

16	six medium sized building blocks. The main concern of the 
<P>

17	closest neighbours is the position of the access way on 
<P>

18	the western as opposed to the eastern side. I did write 
<P>

19	to all the neighbours who had lodged written objections 
<P>

20	and offered to discuss the matter on site and two 
<P>

21	households responded. 
<P>

22	Now this eastern way. Why did we reject it?
<P>

23	This is the... the way on the eastern side. You've got 
<P>

24	the plans...
<P>

25	There are several very very difficult problems with this. 
<P>

26	It's the steepest slope on the block and a lot of cutting 
<P>

27	and filling would be required to get it down to the 25% 
<P>

28	maximum permitted. An attractive screen of trees on the 
<P>

29	eastern boundary would have to go. Access to lot 3 would 
<P>

30	be very difficult. Lot 4 would be cut in two by the 
<P>

31	access way and lot 1 would be reduced to 780 square 
<P>

32	metres and to 680 square metres with a sixteen metre 
<P>

33	frontage onto the Copeland Road if we retained the 
<P>

34	outdoor living areas as common sense would dictate... the 
<P>

35	terrace that Deirdre mentioned. This did not make sense 
<P>

36	from the point of view of the estate even if the planning 
<P>

37	division would accept it. A middle route would have worse 
<P>

38	problems and I could discuss this further if you wish. 
<P>

39	The western route uses an historically under-utilised 
<P>

40	strip of land about seven and a half metres wide. It 
<P>

41	passes by the garage and bathroom of number 198 and faces 
<P>

42	an almost solid brick wall on number 196. A 2 metre wide 
<P>

43	buffer zone presently planted with tall shrubs will run 
<P>

44	between the access way and the boundary and that will be 
<P>

45	retained as requested by Dr Liu:. It will minimise tree 
<P>

46	loss and go down the slope in the gentlest possible way. 
<P>

47	I have been advised today that an objection lodged on 
<P>

48	behalf of my sister and understandably supported by 
<P>

49	neighbours has been withdrawn by her financial manager 
<P>

50	Mrs Julie Merton after negotiations between her legal 
<P>

51	firm of Hunt and Hunt and the estate solicitor. 
<P>

(Page 3)
<P>

1	In conclusion, the plan is seen by us as the most 
<P>

2	sensitive one to the heritage values of the area and best 
<P>

3	protects the interests of my sister. She is the major 
<P>

4	beneficiary of the estate and will receive the house in 
<P>

5	her own right plus 40% of the proceeds of the land sales, 
<P>

6	the rest being distributed between three other 
<P>

7	beneficiaries.
<P>

8	Cllr Muirhead: Thank you sir. Sir.
<P>

9	Dr Liu: Right. My name is Chee Liu. I'm a general 
<P>

10	practitioner in Dundas for the last thirty odd years. I 
<P>

11	living in Beecroft the last fifteen years. I bought the 
<P>

12	land sixteen years back, and I come to know Mr Robin 
<P>

13	Macdougall... He is owner is a deceased estate now. And
<P>

14	 he at the time that I know him he give me the 
<P>

15	understanding without written of course that he bought 
<P>

16	the land he built the house on the western side because 
<P>

17	he don't want any road when he did divide the land he 
<P>

18	don't want any road on east side. On the other side. So 
<P>

19	we, when we design the house passed with the council 
<P>

20	here, is built the house close to his house as close as 
<P>

21	we can. Therefore, get away from our own common drive. 
<P>

22	And now. Da da. We got two common drive on both side. We 
<P>

23	have a big window facing this proposed driveway. And 
<P>

24	this... behind this window is my study. This is where I 
<P>

25	read book and things like that. There will be four block 
<P>

26	of land behind it passing through the driveway. It will 
<P>

27	be a lot of noise. I feel it will be intruding on my 
<P>

28	enjoyment of my land and my peace and quiet. 
<P>

29	Up to this point, I want to speak on behalf of myself and 
<P>

30	my neighbours about Deirdre's. Now we... know Deirdre 
<P>

31	over the last 15 years. I understood she has lived there 
<P>

32	since she was five years old, and she's been there for 
<P>

33	fifty years. She know this place inside out and she... I
<P>

34	also understood... she is a member of the... beneficiary 
<P>

35	of the estate. And she never been consulted about how
<P>

36	this land going to be divided although she live on it 
<P>

37	and... for Deirdre's activity in... on her property which 
<P>

38	I happen to be a neighbour is mainly on this western side 
<P>

39	where the driveway going to go through. This is where she 
<P>

40	hang her laundry out. This is where she go for a walk. 
<P>

41	She mow her little lawn there. If she not go out in 
<P>

42	street inside house this is where she is. How could I...
<P>

43	... where amateur grow orchids. I got a little shed house 
<P>

44	there. And whenever go to my orchid house, I always see 
<P>

45	Deirdre's there. It's always wave to one another. See 
<P>

46	this is where her live. And she got very strong 
<P>

47	conviction...she want that driveway away from there. This 
<P>

48	her belief in her simple way. Now Deirdre... and being a 
<P>

49	medical practitioner I can say she is a bit on the 
<P>

50	borderline mentally retard person. All right. This is her 
<P>

51	belief and you can't change her that. And I feel it is 
<P>

52	extremely ridiculous for the neighbour and people like me 
<P>

53	to try to protect her against one her own people. It's to 
<P>

54	me... it's crazy. But on the other hand you might say I 
<P>

(Page 4)
<P>

1	might using Deirdre for my own advantage. It's not 
<P>

2	because I can always move.
<P>

3	Cllr Muirhead: OK. Thank you sir. Councillors, questions.
<P>

4	Cllr Pringle: Yes. Question to Mr MacDougall. Noting of 
<P>

5	course this puts Council in a very... I find it extremely 
<P>

6	sad actually. This is to me the most difficult item we've 
<P>

7	actually got on the business papers tonight... We have...
<P>

8	Cllr Cardamatis: I would say all year.
<P>

9	Cllr Pringle: Yes this year. To see a family feuding such 
<P>

10	as this really causes me extreme distress. Mr MacDougall, 
<P>

11	what can you do so that your sister is not so extremely
<P>

12	disadvantaged?
<P>

13	Ian MacDougall: Well, in working up this proposal, as the 
<P>

14	executor of the estate I've had to balance three 
<P>

15	conditions: first of all, to carry out the terms of the 
<P>

16	will in which my father directed me to subdivide the land 
<P>

17	to maximise the return of the land and Deirdre has 40% 
<P>

18	stake in that and her future income will depend on the 
<P>

19	investment of the proceeds by the Protective 
<P>

20	Commissioner. I have also got to keep an eye on Deirdre's 
<P>

21	house and its amenity...
<P>

22	Deirdre Macdougall: No you do not...
<P>

23	Ian MacDougall: ...and thirdly I have also got to keep an 
<P>

24	eye on council guidelines. So steering between these 
<P>

25	three with also a very difficult site to develop. 
<P>

26	Now it's all very well... My father did once tell me that 
<P>

27	he had taken advice and somebody said it would be a good 
<P>

28	idea to put it down the western side...
<P>

29	Deirdre Macdougall: No... 
<P>

30	Ian MacDougall: He always thought more in terms of the 
<P>

31	eastern side for an access way when he came to subdivide 
<P>

32	the land. He never ever did it. He died at the age of 
<P>

33	ninety and he never ever did it for the simple reason it 
<P>

34	was all too hard... He never took professional advice, he 
<P>

35	never got engineers, never got surveyors, and when I came
<P>

36	to address this problem which he had left to me I found 
<P>

37	that really we only have these two options: We go down 
<P>

38	the west or we go down the east. Now...
<P>

39	Cllr McMurray: How come... 
<P>

40	Deirdre Macdougall: Go down the east, thank you.
<P>

41	Ian MacDougall: This eastern route is frought with 
<P>

42	difficulties. This section here... Here's Copeland Road 
<P>

43	here..  This section here is the steepest part on the 
<P>

44	whole block. We would have to cut and fill extensively to 
<P>

45	get the road down there at the maximum 25% slope
<P>

(Page 5)
<P>

1	permitted by council. We've got to access lot 3 here from 
<P>

2	below, from down the hill, very limited access there. The 
<P>

3	access way would cut lot 4 in half, and lot 1 would be 
<P>

4	reduced to 780 square metres... that's here... and if we 
<P>

5	are to retain the patio area of the house...
<P>

6	Deirdre Macdougall: No you're not...
<P>

7	Ian MacDougall: ... and a substantial living area, we 
<P>

8	would be reduced to 680 square metres with a 16 metre 
<P>

9	frontage to Copleland Road. Now all of that means really 
<P>

10	that this being the only conceivable alternative to this 
<P>

11	proposed submitted plan, it's not really an option, 
<P>

12	either under the terms of the guidelines of the council, 
<P>

13	or under the terms of my father's will, or under the 
<P>

14	terms of maintaining the living areas of the house, 
<P>

15	the terrace, the outdoor living area and maximising the 
<P>

16	return from the land as I am directed in the will to do, 
<P>

17	and thereby maximising Deirdre's income for the rest of 
<P>

18	her life.
<P>

19	A Councillor: Irrelevant.
<P>

20	Cllr Muirhead: Question...
<P>

21	Cllr Pringle: I'd like to follow that up actually, 
<P>

22	because I don't think that you've really answered my 
<P>

23	question. I mean, this is your sister you're talking 
<P>

24	about here. I mean...
<P>

25	Deirdre Macdougall: I don't like his plan.
<P>

26	Cllr Pringle: ... what are you going to do to try and 
<P>

27	ameliorate your sister's concerns?
<P>

(<u>The following section is missing from the tape as received from council,
and is reproduced here from memory</u>.)
<P>

28	Cllr Pringle: She's your sister. You didn't even ask 
<P>

29	her. Ian, why is your relationship with your sister 
<P>

30	so bad?
<P>

(<u>Tape as received resumes</u>.)
<P>

31	Ian MacDougall:  Well...
<P>

32	Cllr Vandertouw: What does it say in the will about it?
<P>

33	Ian MacDougall: How much... How much time do we have to 
<P>

34	devote to this?
<P>

35	Cllr Cardamatis: I think we can devote a fair bit because 
<P>

36	this is something that I think everyone...
<P>

37	Cllr McMurray:  Can I get some clarification...
<P>

(Page 6) 
<P>

1	Cllr Muirhead: No sorry, Can we just... I just want to 
<P>

2	deal with questions to these people first. We could deal 
<P>

3	with the questions. No. I want to deal with questions to 
<P>

4	this matter...
<P>

5	Ian MacDougall: Well... Well I will answer the question 
<P>

6	as best I can.
<P>

7	Cllr Muirhead: Yes...    
<P>

8	Ian MacDougall: My fa... My mother died about ten years 
<P>

9	ago, in 1989. There were no internal problems in the 
<P>

10	family until that point in time. After that, my father 
<P>

11	became increasingly... disoriented in his thinking... 
<P>

12	paranoid if you like, about me.
<P>

13	A councillor: Yeah.
<P>

14	Ian MacDougall: Particularly grievous to him was the fact 
<P>

15	that I got married to a religious woman...
<P>

16	Deirdre Macdougall: Pain in the arse...
<P>

17	Ian MacDougall: And he... and the result was that he saw 
<P>

18	less and less of us... and where our relationship while 
<P>

19	my mother was alive was perfectly OK, it deteriorated 
<P>

20	from that point on. My wife was accused of having designs
<P>

21	on all of his estate, et cetera, et cetera.
<P>

22	A councillor: Ah.
<P>

23	Ian MacDougall: So by the time he died I was really on 
<P>

24	the outer and excluded. Unfortunately I feel that he has 
<P>

25	conveyed this attitude of his to my sister...
<P>

26	Deirdre Macdougall: Not my bloody sister...
<P>

27	Ian MacDougall: And she became increasingly hostile to 
<P>

28	me. I hope this situation reverses in future. 
<P>

29	Deirdre Macdougall: No it won't.
<P>

30	Ian MacDougall: But in the mean time, in the mean time I 
<P>

31	think that in subdividing this land I have provided 
<P>

32	adequately for my sister's... the amenity of her house, 
<P>

33	giving her a manageable area and also provided her 
<P>

34	obeying the terms of the will.
<P>

35	Cllr Muirhead: Can we...
<P>

36	Ian MacDougall: Can I just finish on this? I was up there 
<P>

37	last week and Deirdre said to me "<i>It's all too much for </i>
<P>

38	<i>me. It's too much to manage</i>." And we were trying to fire 
<P>

39	proof the place... It was like a fire bomb with all this 
<P>

40	dry tinder all around and I'm trying to help her in those 
<P>

41	ways as best I can, but I'm coming from a very very 
<P>

42	difficult basis.
<P>

(Page 7)
<P>

1	Cllr Muirhead: Yes. Just if I could... Sorry 
<P>

2	councillors... Just on the driveway issue...
<P>

3	Ian MacDougall: Yes.
<P>

4	Cllr Muirhead: Why can't the driveway go down on the...
<P>

5	Cllr Pringle: The middle, close enough, in other words... 
<P>

6	Cllr Muirhead: The middle, but not a straight line, being 
<P>

7	a curved line down the middle, coming slightly in, more 
<P>

8	of the centre from Copeland Road, curving around, missing
<P>

9	the paving area and basically back joining in where 
<P>

10	you've written five passing bay whatever on that... 
<P>

11	joining into there... which doesn't affect you lot number 
<P>

12	3, 4 but et cettera et cetera. Doesn't go down... The 
<P>

13	inconvenience would be a driveway next to the saleable 
<P>

14	value of lot 1 admittedly, would not affect the neighbour 
<P>

15	in 196, Deirdre would be happy with that wouldn't you 
<P>

16	Deirdre? A driveway on the other side?
<P>

17	Deirdre Macdougall: On the east side, yes...
<P>

18	Cllr Muirhead: On the east side, yes...
<P>

19	Deirdre Macdougall: But three feet away from my terrace,  
<P>

20	I've had enough of him...  
<P>

21	Cllr Muirhead: Ok Deirdre it's all right. And do it that 
<P>

22	way. What's... What would be the problem with that? 
<P>

23	Ian MacDougall: Well... I'm sure that Tony Gilbert will 
<P>

24	back me up on this, but there is a... at the terrace... 
<P>

25	where the height of the terrace is where you can see... 
<P>

26	there is a ... one of your elite trees there, an 
<P>

27	angophora. We have to miss that otherwise we come 
<P>

28	straight through the terrace... If we go...
<P>

29	Deirdre Macdougall: No you're not.
<P>

30	Ian MacDougall: If we go straight through the terrace we 
<P>

31	preserve a substantial lot 1, and the sale of lot 1 will 
<P>

32	have to finance the rest of the subdivision because my 
<P>

33	father also left me no money to do this with. The second 
<P>

34	thing is that we're coming from the level of the terrace 
<P>

35	down a height of about two metres down to the ground 
<P>

36	below, and we would again run into problems of steepness 
<P>

37	of the slope. We'd have to do an awful lot of filling, of 
<P>

38	making a rampart down there, a sort of a causeway to, 
<P>

39	to... , and cutting as well so you'd... you'd run down 
<P>

40	this causeway and then go into a cutting to get down the 
<P>

41	slope. Whereas if you notice the 116 metre contour Mr 
<P>

42	Mayor, you'll see that you cross that on the western... 
<P>

43	on the western route very close... comparatively close to 
<P>

44	Copeland Road. On the... on the centre or the eastern 
<P>

45	route you cross that at the back boundary of that block, 
<P>

46	so we're making use of a gently sloping section of the 
<P>

47	block to put this access way down and we're keeping it 
<P>

(Page 8)
<P>

1	away from the living areas both of 198 and we're faced 
<P>

2	with a solid brick wall with a small window in it and a 
<P>

3	camellia screen in between on 196.
<P>

4	Cllr Nanelli: Leading on from what the mayor... the mayor 
<P>

5	said and you've said about the difficulties of the site 
<P>

6	and the steepness of it, have you considered reducing the 
<P>

7	number of lots say to five for example. Then you'd have 
<P>

8	larger lots and presumably would get a larger sale price
<P>

9	 for the larger sized lots and that may overcome the 
<P>

10	problems of cut and fill and all the other problems that 
<P>

11	you've mentioned. Keeping it in the middle... keeping the 
<P>

12	driveway in the middle or to the eastern side, and then 
<P>

13	reducing the number of lots say by one, you'd have larger 
<P>

14	lots... I would then anticipate you'd get a larger price 
<P>

15	for each of the lots and perhaps overcome some of those 
<P>

16	problems of cut and fill that you're talking about.
<P>

17	Ian MacDougall:  Would you like to deal with that?
<P>

18	Richard Smith: Its... its the front lots that are 
<P>

19	critical.
<P>

20	Cllr Nanelli: What, number 1?
<P>

21	Richard Smith: Yeah... Well, 1 and 2. The lot 4 as... as 
<P>

22	Ian has pointed out if the driveway comes down the 
<P>

23	eastern side and I think the distinction should be 
<P>

24	clearly in Deirdre's mind as to what... I don't think she 
<P>

25	wants the central route, she wants the the eastern route 
<P>

26	depicted on the sketch 3 that councillors and the mayor 
<P>

27	have been given. 
<P>

28	Ian MacDougall: This one here... 
<P>

29	Richard Smith: There's no need to reduce the number 
<P>

30	of lots... The question will be up the front, and unless you 
<P>

31	cut out one of the lots completely... and make... a huge 
<P>

32	lot up top...
<P>

33	Cllr Cardamatis: Before you go on, is anyone of the 
<P>

34	belief that this can be resolved tonight? I don't think 
<P>

35	so.
<P>

36	Cllr Vandertouw: I don't want to decide on Deirdre's life 
<P>

37	at one o'clock in the morning.
<P>

38	Cllr Cardamatis: I don't think so either. I think 
<P>

39	something that has to be taken on board here goes well 
<P>

40	beyond the realms of what we normally do.
<P>

41	Dr Liu: ...out of order but I wish... Please let me say 
<P>

42	something. 
<P>

43	Cllr Muirhead: Very, very quickly.
<P>

44	Dr Liu: As a doctor for forty years I say if the decision 
<P>

45	is not move that driveway somewhere else the result of 
<P>

(Page 9)
<P>

1	Deirdre will be devastating and in fact will all give me
<P>

2	... I'm not trying to threaten you.................
<P>

3	Cllr Cardamatis: No. I concur with you so totally...
<P>

4	Dr Liu: Before I stick my neck out... otherwise...
<P>

5	(<u>At this point Dr Liu: [inaudible on tape] ventured </u>
<P>

6	<u>the opinion that Deirdre could have a nervous </u>
<P>

7	<u>breakdown if the driveway went in the proposed </u>
<P>

8	<u>location.)</u>  
<P>

9	Cllr Cardamatis: I totally agree with you and I think it 
<P>

10	would be over my dead body and most other councillors 
<P>

11	that it happened there.
<P>

12	Cllr McMurray: Mr Mayor.
<P>

13	Cllr Cardamatis: I just want to say something.
<P>

14	Cllr Muirhead: Sorry. Can we deal with questions till we 
<P>

15	can to these people first...
<P>

16	Cllr Cardamatis: OK.
<P>

17	Cllr Muirhead: Are there any further questions to these 
<P>

18	people? Councillor McMurray.
<P>

19	Cllr McMurray: To the executor of this estate. I'm just 
<P>

20	looking at this plan of... council plans. I am suggesting 
<P>

21	to you that this access way to this subdivision is 
<P>

22	between... between lot 1 and lot 2. I question why you 
<P>

23	say there is a drop of 2 metres when in fact the RL 
<P>

24	levels tell me that there's... it's 116 on the Copeland 
<P>

25	Road frontage and also down where the passing bay is its 
<P>

26	116 also...  
<P>

27	(<u>Omitted from tape record): I can read a map too you </u>
<P>

28	<u>know</u>).
<P>

29	I... I think you stated that your sister is a beneficiary 
<P>

30	of this estate to the tune of 40%...
<P>

31	Ian MacDougall: Forty percent of the land sales. Plus the 
<P>

32	house and curtilage.
<P>

33	Cllr McMurray: OK. Might I suggest to you that... you 
<P>

34	stated that you have your sister's best interests at 
<P>

35	heart, that you think about her mental health... and you 
<P>

36	also...
<P>

37	Deirdre Macdougall: I don't talk to him...
<P>

38	Cllr McMurray: And you also think of what would actually 
<P>

39	make her happy for the rest of her life... 
<P>

40	Deirdre Macdougall: Not him.
<P>

(Page 10)
<P>

1	Cllr McMurray: I know that dollars can talk many 
<P>

2	languages but I think your sister might be even be 
<P>

3	willing to forego part of her share if indeed she got 
<P>

4	really what she wanted out of this...
<P>

5	Deirdre Macdougall: That's true.
<P>

6	Cllr McMurray: And what I'm asking for is a little bit of 
<P>

7	compassion, and I hate to see families sitting here 
<P>

8	brawling over... over estates. Many families have broken 
<P>

9	up because the beneficiaries are all sitting there 
<P>

10	squabbling about aunty's this and aunty's that. Now I 
<P>

11	think human relations are more important than the mighty 
<P>

12	dollar and might I suggest to you... I would like to 
<P>

13	suggest that we could move an amendment that you could 
<P>

14	come back to us with amended plans with the access way to 
<P>

15	go between lots 1 and 2.
<P>

16	Cllr Pringle: I'll second that.
<P>

17	Cllr Muirhead: Can we just...
<P>

18	Ian MacDougall: Can I point out something there?
<P>

19	Cllr Muirhead: No. We're going to deal very quickly now 
<P>

20	councillors. Any more questions to the applicant... 
<P>

21	sorry, any of the people.
<P>

22	Cllr McMurray: I'm asking... I'm asking the executor of 
<P>

23	this estate
<P>

24	Cllr Muirhead: OK. Yes.
<P>

25	Cllr McMurray: Whether he would he like to consider his 
<P>

26	sister's mental health...
<P>

27	Cllr Muirhead: Sir. Would you like to answer that?
<P>

28	Ian MacDougall: Yes. Well I'm... I mean I'm... I... 
<P>

29	I suppose I feel that I'm being accused of having no 
<P>

30	compassion in this situation...
<P>

31	Cllr McMurray: No I'm not accusing of you of any. We've 
<P>

32	got a problem here... You, I you...recognise it, you 
<P>

33	recognise it...
<P>

34	Ian MacDougall: Yeah. OK. If we were to put this access 
<P>

35	way down the middle here...
<P>

36	Deirdre Macdougall: No you won't.
<P>

37	Cllr Cardamatis: Look, I don't think we need to discuss 
<P>

38	the access way any more.
<P>

39	Ian MacDougall: No. Just a minute...
<P>

40	Cllr Cardamatis: No. No. This matter needs to be 
<P>

41	deferred. We can't decide on any access way tonight. I 
<P>

(Page 11)
<P>

1	just want to make a brief point and then move this motion 
<P>

2	for deferral...
<P>

3	Cllr Muirhead: Well I want to just get... Do you want to 
<P>

4	get...
<P>

5	Ian MacDougall: Can I say I am...
<P>

6	Cllr Muirhead: Sir, I will have... Councillors.
<P>

7	Cllr McMurray: I asked a question. I'm asking for an 
<P>

8	answer.
<P>

9	Ian MacDougall: Yes. I'm trying to answer the question.
<P>

10	Cllr Muirhead: You have five seconds.
<P>

11	Ian MacDougall: I'm being asked to come back with an 
<P>

12	alternative plan with the access way down the middle. I 
<P>

13	don't think Deirdre would accept that either.
<P>

14	Deirdre Macdougall: No I do not!
<P>

15	Cllr Muirhead: Deirdre, we're talking about having a 
<P>

16	driveway not on the eastern side. Away from your house.
<P>

17	Deirdre Macdougall: Yeah. I want it on the east side.
<P>

18	Cllr Muirhead: That's what... that's what we're talking 
<P>

19	about.
<P>

20	Cllr McMurray: That's where it is.
<P>

21	Cllr Muirhead: That's what we're talking about. OK.
<P>

22	Deirdre Macdougall: Oh. Sorry.
<P>

23	Cllr Muirhead: That's what we're talking about.
<P>

24	Cllr Cardamatis: I want to move a motion that's...
<P>

25	Cllr Muirhead: Again no. I just want to deal with it. Any 
<P>

26	further questions to the people here?
<P>

27	Cllr Cardamatis: Yeah. I really need to just say 
<P>

28	something. I've been trying to say it, and I just have to 
<P>

29	get it off my chest I'm sorry.
<P>

30	Cllr Muirhead: Yes.
<P>

31	Cllr Cardamatis: Deirdre has spent one year speaking to 
<P>

32	us. We can not put this aside tonight. We know this 
<P>

33	woman. She is here every Wednesday. She is as part of 
<P>

34	this council as all of us. I don't know if you've known 
<P>

35	that but we see her every week without fail and we have 
<P>

36	her interests very at heart that go well beyond any other 
<P>

37	DA that I've seen come before this council. So this 
<P>

38	matter I want to move and I know...
<P>

(Page 12)
<P>

1	Cllr Muirhead: I know. We'll just get these questions 
<P>

2	over. Any further questions?
<P>

3	Cllr Pringle: Yes just this.
<P>

4	Cllr Muirhead: Very quickly.
<P>

5	Cllr Pringle: Yes one last one. Ian, are you a practising 
<P>

6	Christian?
<P>

7	Ian MacDougall: Me? No. No I'm not. But that doesn't 
<P>

8	mean...
<P>

9	Cllr Pringle: But your wife is?
<P>

10	Ian MacDougall: ... that I'm not a good man. My wife is.
<P>

11	Cllr Nanelli: I don't think that's relevant.
<P>

12	Cllr Muirhead: I don't think that's really a relevant 
<P>

13	question. 
<P>

14	Cllr McMurray: Not relevant! It decidedly is! 
<P>

15	Cllr Muirhead: Councillor Vandertouw have you got a 
<P>

16	question? Sorry. Excuse me. Councillor Vandertouw...
<P>

17	Cllr Pringle: That's hypocrisy.
<P>

18	Ian MacDougall: (agreeing with comment from the hall) I 
<P>

19	think that is right. I think it is bloody outrageous.
<P>

20	Cllr Cardamatis: Not at all.
<P>

21	Cllr Pringle: Not at all!
<P>

22	Ian MacDougall: Why not at all?
<P>

23	Cllr Pringle: You're a hypocrite. Aren't you?
<P>

24	Cllr Muirhead: Excuse me.
<P>

25	Ian MacDougall: Am I a practising Christian? What on 
<P>

26	Earth has that got to do...
<P>

27	Cllr Muirhead: Excuse me. Excuse me sir. Councillor 
<P>

28	Vandertouw, you had a question?
<P>

29	Cllr Vandertouw: Yeah just... Sorry but in the... will, 
<P>

30	were you instructed to not, were you instructed to... 
<P>

31	look after the amenity of Deirdre's life? Are you 
<P>

32	instructed to be careful of anything you did in the way 
<P>

33	of development that didn't disrupt her life?
<P>

34	Cllr Muirhead: Ah.. Sorry, I'll have to rule that 
<P>

35	question out of order. Under the Act we are assessing a 
<P>

36	development application under the Planning and Assessment 
<P>

(Page 13)
<P>

1	Act. The issues of why the development is taking place 
<P>

2	and the details of the estate are not part of the 
<P>

3	assessment procedure. I'm sorry. I'll have to rule on 
<P>

4	that.
<P>

5	Ian MacDougall: Mr Mayor...
<P>

6	Cllr Muirhead: No. Excuse me. Further questions 
<P>

7	councillors to the people here... Who are going to try 
<P>

8	very hard at Christmas to be... yeah. OK. If you'd all 
<P>

9	take your seats. Move back to your seats. Thanks very 
<P>

10	much. Councillor Cardiamtis. You had something.
<P>

11	Cllr Cardamatis: That this matter be deferred to allow a 
<P>

12	further report as to the location of the driveway to be 
<P>

13	decided on. 
<P>

14	Cllr Muirhead: OK. It has been moved...
<P>

15	Cllr Pringle: And seconded.
<P>

16	Cllr Muirhead: It has been moved by Councillor 
<P>

17	Cardamatis, seconded by Councillor Pringle that the 
<P>

18	matter be deferred but...
<P>

19	Cllr McMurray: I just want to have some... clarification 
<P>

20	in regard to Councillor Cardimatis'...
<P>

21	Cllr Muirhead: Councillor McMurray.
<P>

22	Cllr McMurray: Who is going to assess what?
<P>

23	Cllr Pringle or Cllr Cardamatis: Good point.
<P>

24	Cllr McMurray: That motion does not scrub up too well.
<P>

25	Cllr Muirhead: OK. Well...
<P>

26	Cllr Cardamatis: It's late.
<P>

27	Cllr Pringle: The location of the driveway which 
<P>

28	satisfies environmental considerations and the personal 
<P>

29	interests of Ms Macdougall...
<P>

30	Cllr McMurray: I'm sorry, I... don't believe we can move 
<P>

31	a motion along those lines.
<P>

32	Cllr Muirhead: No. 
<P>

33	Cllr Cardamatis: All right. Well it has to definitely 
<P>

34	come back before the council.
<P>

35	Cllr McMurray: I would request that we ask the 
<P>

36	application... applicant to provide amended plans for an 
<P>

37	access way between lots 1 and 2.
<P>

38	Cllr Muirhead: OK.
<P>

(Page 14)
<P>

1	Cllr Pringle: Which protect the amenity of...
<P>

2	Cllr McMurray: The dwelling in lot...
<P>

3	Cllr Pringle: Number one hundred and ninety eight.
<P>

4	Cllr Muirhead: OK. We've got that.
<P>

5	Cllr Cardamatis: Fully scrubbed up?
<P>

6	Cllr Muirhead: Fully scrubbed up. Been moved by 
<P>

7	Councillor Cardamatis seconded by Councillor Pringle. 
<P>

8	Debate.
<P>

9	Cllr Horne: Is that the only alternative?
<P>

10	Cllr Muirhead: Debate.
<P>

11	Cllr Cardamatis: Can you think of another one?
<P>

12	Cllr Horne: No...
<P>

13	Cllr Muirhead: Councillors. Right of reply. Councillor 
<P>

14	Cardimatis?
<P>

15	Cllr Cardamatis: No thank you.
<P>

16	Cllr Muirhead: Right. Councillors we have the one motion
<P>

17	in front of us is a deferral to allow amended plans to 
<P>

18	come back, protecting the amenity et cetera... in the
<P>

19	middle. OK.
<P>

20	Those in favour?
<P>

21	Councillors: Aye.
<P>

22	Cllr Muirhead: Those against? Declare that carried. Thank 
<P>

23	you.
<P>

24	We have dealt with that...item number thirty seven...

TRANSCRIPT OF TAPE OF PLANNING MEETING OF HORNSBY COUNCIL AT COUNCIL CHAMBERS,
HORNSBY, 18.02.98.
<P>

Transcript prepared by Ian MacDougall. 
<P>

THE DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION LODGED BY A.C. GILBERT &amp; CO, CONSULTING
SURVEYORS, WAS ITEM 7 ON THE AGENDA.
<P>

<center>********************************</center>
<P>


<P>

The Mayor of Hornsby, Cllr John Muirhead, was in the chair.
<P>

(Page 1)
<P>

1	Cllr Muirhead: Item number 7. Copeland Road Beecroft. Do
<P>

2	we have any members of the public regarding this item?
<P>

3	Item number seven is Copeland Road Beecroft. Subdivision
<P>

4	of one allotment into six in two stages. Hello Mr
<P>

5	MacDougall. How are you? Um now, you're both speaking? 
<P>

6	Right. Who's speaking on this side? One speaker.
<P>

7	Ian MacDougall: Two.
<P>

8	Cllr Muirhead: One.
<P>

9	Ian MacDougall: Can we split it between the two of us?
<P>

10	Cllr Muirhead: Well, one and a half minutes each if you
<P>

11	wish.
<P>

12	Ian MacDougall: Yes, that'll be all right.
<P>

13	Cllr Muirhead: Fine. If you'd like to start, doctor. Yes.
<P>

14	Kelvin Low: Yes. Look I live opposite Deirdre Macdougall. 
<P>

15	We're really talking about Deirdre Macdougall today. This 
<P>

16	is a very sad case involving not just a planned
<P>

17	subdivision, but a subdivision which affects Deirdre's 
<P>

18	future. You know Deirdre. She's been here in the past. 
<P>

19	She's intellectually impaired. She's down there. She's as
<P>

20	scared as hell as what you might do today. I'm scared as 
<P>

21	hell as what you might do today. I think if it goes 
<P>

22	through, you'll have a very sad case on your hands. 
<P>

23	Today. There's no doubt about that. This is not a case 
<P>

24	about money. This is a case about what is in the best 
<P>

25	interests of Deirdre. 
<P>

26	Now in terms of the social impact, that's one of the
<P>

27	matters I ask you as councillors to take into 
<P>

28	consideration. You have a duty to look after her best
<P>

29	interests. I can't do it. I'm not her financial guardian. 
<P>

30	The sad case is that a financial guardian was appointed, 
<P>

31	but due to the pressures placed upon that financial 
<P>

32	guardian, she no longer is the financial guardian, and at
<P>

33	the moment there's a situation where there's no financial 
<P>

34	guardian. She can't come here because she can't be 
<P>

35	represented, and I understand it will be at least three 
<P>

36	weeks before a financial guardian is appointed, and the
<P>

(Page 2)
<P>

1	financial guardian will need more time to consider
<P>

2	this very very complex matter. 
<P>

3	On the last occasion, whilst I was not here I understand
<P>

4	that Council did not pass the application. The 
<P>

5	application before you is substantially the same as the
<P>

6	one which was before you on the last occasion. There are
<P>

7	some minor changes, but it's substantially the same. But 
<P>

8	I understand that there is an option which has been 
<P>

9	placed before you and which is in the papers which I've 
<P>

10	seen, and can I indicate that Deirdre Macdougall would 
<P>

11	accept Option B. That would impact on the terrace, but 
<P>

12	she would be prepared to accept that option. That's a 
<P>

13	matter that needs to be explored by the developer, the 
<P>

14	developer who is the brother, and I'd ask you to reject 
<P>

15	the application today, and if you at the back of your 
<P>

16	mind think that this is a matter that must go through, 
<P>

17	then please defer it at the very least to enable Deirdre 
<P>

18	Macdougall to have her own representation on the next 
<P>

19	occasion, who can probably put to you matters about how
<P>

20	she feels, and probably put to the developer about her 
<P>

21	position in respect of that Option B, which is the middle 
<P>

22	the one down the road. Because at the end of the day, as
<P>

23	I understand it, Option B makes little or no difference
<P>

24	to the estate in terms of the return. Option B would give
<P>

25	the estate a return which would be just as lucrative as 
<P>

26	the plan down the side. 
<P>

27	And it doesn't matter to the developer. He lives in the
<P>

28	country. He's not going to worry about it. It's money to
<P>

29	him. That's all he's worried about. The money aspect of 
<P>

30	it all. But we have something higher than that. We've got
<P>

31	to look at her best interests. And I implore you to look 
<P>

32	at that aspect of this case, a very sad case, and to
<P>

33	reject it.
<P>

34	Cllr Muirhead: Thank you. Sir.
<P>

35	Con Yallouris: I'm Deirdre's cousin Con Yallouris. I've 
<P>

36	known Deirdre all my life, and her father's wishes before
<P>

37	he died was to have the road on the east side, and that's 
<P>

38	her wishes too. That's all I'd like to say.
<P>

39	Cllr Muirhead: Thanks very much. You're speaking aren't
<P>

40	you? Yes. You're both speaking one and a half minutes. 
<P>

41	Who'd like to start? You're going to start?
<P>

42	Kevin Walsh: OK. Just to... Thank you Mr Mayor and 
<P>

43	councillors. To fill you in on the background of this, 
<P>

44	that er... Robin Macdougall, who died on the 21st of 
<P>

45	December 1986...
<P>

46	Cllr Pringle: You sir are? Sorry. Your name?
<P>

47	Kevin Walsh: Kevin Walsh. Solicitor for the estate. His 
<P>

48	estate can be considered to be asset rich and income 
<P>

49	poor. The moderate amount of cash that he left has been
<P>

50	used to pay debts including land tax; the land is subject
<P>

(Page 3)
<P>

1	to land tax, and his funeral and testamentary expenses.
<P>

2	The balance has been utilised to pay for the subdivision 
<P>

3	costs to date and it is fast running out. The late Robin
<P>

4	Macdougall knew his land was extremely valuable and he 
<P>

5	was at great pains and concern to provide for his
<P>

6	intellectually disabled daughter. She is mentioned by
<P>

7	name seven times in his will as compared to his son Ian,
<P>

8	who is mentioned by name four times. The direction to 
<P>

9	subdivide and maximise the return is spelt out in the
<P>

10	will and also, I don't need to tell you Mr Mayor it is an
<P>

11	executor's statutory duty to maximise, not lessen, the
<P>

12	value of a potentially valuable subdivision. The 
<P>

13	testator's first and main aim being to provide sufficient 
<P>

14	capital for his daughter to maintain a home in Copeland
<P>

15	Road Beecroft and to generate a sufficient income for her
<P>

16	to enjoy a better than average lifestyle. The executor 
<P>

17	must be able to present for sale a valuable block of land 
<P>

18	in the estate adjoining the existing home, the proceeds 
<P>

19	of which will be utilised to complete the necessary... 
<P>

20	the axeway construction and subdivision. 
<P>

21	Cllr Muirhead: Thank you for your time. Mr MacDougall.
<P>

22	Ina MacDougall: Thank you...
<P>

23	Cllr Muirhead: Stay seated. You're right.
<P>

24	Ian MacDougall: We basically have three options here Mr
<P>

25	Mayor. We can go with the existing DA, we can cut off the 
<P>

26	house... on a second option we can cut off the house on 
<P>

27	its own block of land and sell the balance <u>in globo</u>, and 
<P>

28	that would not yield anything like a sufficient income 
<P>

29	that my father had in mind for his daughter in this will
<P>

30	which I can quote and which incidentally was drafted 
<P>

31	by Mr Low. The third option is to sell the entire asset and 
<P>

32	relocate Deirdre to something less expensive, and that 
<P>

33	has already been suggested to me. 
<P>

34	Now I don't want to do that. But the estate at the 
<P>

35	present time has got about five thousand dollars in the 
<P>

36	bank and all the options except the existing DA before 
<P>

37	you now really do not satisfy the terms of the will and
<P>

38	do not provide my sister with anything like what she is 
<P>

39	used to. I ask Council here to just address the planning 
<P>

40	issues and leave my sister's concerns to the Protective 
<P>

41	Commissioner. On these matters I do not think that it is 
<P>

42	appropriate for the Council, or for the Land and 
<P>

43	Environment Court, or for the neighbours to decide. I 
<P>

44	think the appropriate person now is the Protective 
<P>

45	Commissioner.
<P>

46	Cllr Muirhead: Thank you. Councillors, questions.
<P>

47	Cllr Horne: Would you be prepared to wait for the 
<P>

48	Protective Commissioner to voice his or her opinion in 
<P>

49	two or three weeks whenever the time is... When he or she 
<P>

50	has gone into the case?
<P>

(Page 4)
<P>

1	Ian MacDougall: Certainly. Certainly.
<P>

2	Kevin Walsh: We're prepared if the motion... if the
<P>

3	 application is approved that it be made subject to the...
<P>

4	Cllr Horne: Would you be prepared... 
<P>

5	Kevin Walsh: ...the approval of the and consent of the 
<P>

6	Protective Commissioner.
<P>

7	Cllr Horne: Would you be prepared to have it deferred 
<P>

8	until further advice?
<P>

9	Kevin Walsh: No. No. 
<P>

10	Cllr Muirhead: Thank you. Further questions?
<P>

11	Cllr Blunt: Are you prepared to move the driveway to the
<P>

12	other side?
<P>

13	Ian MacDougall: To which side are you talking about?
<P>

14	Cllr Blunt: To the middle. To the middle.
<P>

15	Cllr Horne: Option B.
<P>

16	Ian MacDougall: To the middle. The, the... It is not a 
<P>

17	financial option for the estate. It is not possible.
<P>

18	Cllr Muirhead: OK. Thank you. Further questions? Right, 
<P>

19	if you'd like to take your seats. Thank you. Councillor 
<P>

20	Pringle.
<P>

21	Cllr Pringle: Mr Mayor, in the light of the information 
<P>

22	we've got tonight I'd move that the application be 
<P>

23	refused on the following grounds: Adverse impact on the 
<P>

24	streetscape. The unacceptable location of the driveway. 
<P>

25	Over-development of the site. Loss of significant trees. 
<P>

26	And that it's not in the public interest.
<P>

27	Cllr Muirhead: Moved by Councillor Pringle. Seconded... 
<P>

28	Do we have a seconder? Seconded Councillor Vandertouw. 
<P>

29	Councillor Pringle, would you add that in that with
<P>

30	the... in you motion the impact on the residential 
<P>

31	amenity of the existing dwelling as to noise, headlights
<P>

32	and loss of private recreation space?
<P>

33	Cllr Pringle: Certainly. Happy with that.
<P>

34	Cllr Muirhead: Debate. Those in favour.
<P>

35	Councillor Pringle: Aye.
<P>

36	Cllr Muirhead: Those against. Declare that carried.
