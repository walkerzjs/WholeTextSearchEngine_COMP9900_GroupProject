<p><b><u>REGINA v KERRIE ANNE GALLUZZO</u></b>

<p> <b>006/93</b>

<p> <b>20 December 1994</b>

<p> <b>Grove J</b>

<p> <b>The Supreme Court of New South Wales Criminal Division</b>

<p> <b><u>DETERMINATION OF LIFE SENTENCE</u></b>

<p> <b>HIS HONOUR</b>:     Kerrie Anne Galluzzo (the applicant) seeks fixing of minimum and additional terms which together will replace an original sentence
of penal servitude for life imposed at Central Criminal Court on 21 June 1985 for the murder of her husband Francis Anthony (Frank)
Galluzzo.  I  did not fix a commencement date for that sentence as so doing had no juridical significance then and, for administration
purposes of possible release on licence, the existing Board had access to the means of calculating actual time served.  The killing
occurred on 3 January 1984 and the applicant was released on bail six days later and remained at conditional liberty until it was
revoked on the commencement of trial on 27 May 1985.  The applicant has been in continuous custody since.  It will account for pre-sentence
custody if any minimum term now to be set commences on 21 May 1985.

<p> The application is supported by the Serious Offenders Review Council (formerly Board) and not opposed by the Crown.  In my view it
is apt to fix a determinate sentence.  My task requires the taking into account, as I do of the precepts contained in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> and in particular:

<p> 	"13A	(9)	The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section, is to have regard to:

<p> (a)	the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on
licence under section 463 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> and of the practice relating to the issue of such licences;  and

<p> (b)	any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example,
reports on the person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court;  and

<p> (c)	any relevant comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing the sentence;  and

<p> (d)	the age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application),

<p> and may have regard to any other relevant matter."

<p> The applicant has no convictions other than for this offence of murder.  She was aged twenty three when it was committed and is now
aged thirty four.  She is the mother of a daughter and son now aged fourteen and twelve respectively. 

<p> At the time of imposing the original sentence I made relatively brief remarks. The jury had returned its verdict on 29 May and Mr
Hidden QC (who appeared for the applicant at trial) was granted an adjournment in order to investigate whether material in support
of application of the proviso in current legislation to mandatory life sentence might be able to be produced.  During the adjournment
the decision in <u>R v Bell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1985%202%20NSWLR%20466" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1985 2 NSWLR 466</a> was published (6 June 1985) which determined that factors relevant to significant diminution of culpability were those which influenced
the conduct constituting the commission of the murder and/or the state of the offender's mind.  Mr Hidden frankly acknowledged that
he could not present such material deriving either from the trial or elsewhere and the mandatory sentence was imposed in the light
of that concession.

<p> Length of sentence, upon finding that minimum and additional terms should be set, is discretionary.  It is appropriate now to make
more detailed findings for the purpose of sentence particularly in the light of the denials and refusals of admission which have
been pleaded by the applicant in the Notice of Reply to the Statement of Facts filed by the Crown in compliance with the Practice
Direction.  As I pointed out to Mr Green QC who appeared for the applicant in this hearing, if the reply was sustained in its terms,
the culpability of the applicant would stand totally extinguished.  This was recognized as well the inevitability of the applicant
being dealt with in accordance with the jury verdict which was, of course, contrary to her protestations.  I note that she has, apparently,
continued to deny her guilt for example to the Serious Offenders Review Board and to Ms Ramrakha,  a psychologist at Mulawa Correctional
Centre.  The applicant declined the opportunity to support the denials in her pleading by her own or any other oral evidence.  

<p> Francis Anthony Galluzzo died as a result of multiple blows to the head administered with an axe by Desmond Lucre.  He was assisted
in the removal and attempted disposal of the body by Phillip Cramer.  Lucre is the applicant's uncle.  He had been released on parole
from prison in Western Australia in October 1983.  He came to New South Wales to avail himself of the offer of a home being provided
for him by the applicant's mother who was his sister.  His association with Frank Galluzzo was through his niece and amounted to
little more than bare acquaintanceship.  

<p> Lucre testified that the applicant told him that her husband was cruel to her and the children and that leaving him was not an option
because he "always" came after her and gave her  "another belting."  Consequent upon such discussion a suggestion arose that he be
got rid of.  At trial, the applicant gave evidence that she had no such discussion nor did she assert that it was the fact that her
husband had treated her cruelly.  I recognize that the latter assertion, if it had been made then, might be thought to support the
veracity of Lucre.  Mr Green referred to circumstances which he contended would indicate that the idea of killing emanated from Lucre
rather than from the applicant.  I do not accept that Lucre perpetrated the murder without any inspiration from the applicant.  No
doubt he is a man of evil disposition and ruthless action but the conduct of the applicant at the time of the killing amply confirms
her participation.

<p> There is no need to describe what were said by Lucre to be abandoned plans. Shortly after midnight on 3 January 1984, Lucre entered
the Galluzzo home.  The applicant had left an entry door unlocked.  Lucre armed himself with an axe which was obtained from the garage.
 The applicant and her husband were together in bed.  After the first blow was struck with the blunt end of the axehead, Lucre told
the applicant to leave and she arose and went out of the room.  She later gave the keys of a car to Lucre.  He and Cramer wrapped
the body in a sheet and carried it to place it in the boot of the car.  On the way they dropped what they were conveying on the path
and this resulted in some spillage of blood and brain matter.  After the body was deposited in the car, Lucre returned and joined
the applicant in some cleaning activity although this was wholly ineffective in erasing the signs of what had happened.  However,
they remade the bed and thereafter Lucre and Cramer departed.  They were arrested in some bushland where they were noticed by passing
police to be attempting to destroy the car by fire.  

<p> I reject the applicant's evidence given at trial that she did not participate in her husband's death.  Similarly I reject her evidence
that she spent the night sleeping in her daughter's room and awoke only when police knocked on the door.  

<p> There had been some attempt to clean the spillage from the path.  I accept the evidence of police observation of a footprint, the
description of which associated with the state of the applicant's feet, lead me to conclude that she had participated in that particular
attempt.  The applicant's knowledge of what occurred is confirmed by her remark to Detective Sergeant Smith enquiring how one was
to tell children that their father was not coming home.  I recognize that knowledge does not of itself impute culpability but I find
the applicant's story of uninterrupted slumber during the killing, the transport of the body to the car and the unsuccessful cleaning
is quite preposterous.  

<p> Therefore although I approach the testimony of a man such as Lucre with considerable reserve I conclude that I should accept it as
generally consistent with the objective circumstances and the evidence of police officers about which no reason for non acceptance
was advanced.  

<p> The exercise by the applicant of her right not to give evidence in the present hearing in the context of her repeated protestations
of innocence results, as Mr Green had to concede, in an almost inevitable finding that she is not contrite.  She is not obliged to
be that or to be remorseful but she cannot therefore claim contrition as a factor in mitigation of the sentence which I am now to
impose.  I find that she is unrepentant for her crime.  

<p> Little more need be said about the crime and the trial itself.  As I have mentioned, I can understand the tactical difficulty at
trial of an assertion that the applicant had been mistreated by her husband.  That difficulty no longer exists.  It should be noted
that she has been content to leave the evidence which she gave that she had never discussed such cruelty with Lucre in place and,
further, that there is nothing put before me to suggest that there is a complaint about any such mistreatment.  At trial and in these
proceedings she has been represented by senior counsel and I infer that the applicant is fully conscious that there is no invitation
to find that she possessed any motive founded in provocation or misconduct by her late husband.

<p> The applicant has assimilated to prison life and her good conduct should be counted in her favour.  The Serious Offenders Review
Board summary and conclusion was in these terms:

<p> "Ms Galluzzo appears to be a good prisoner.  She has moved steadily through the system and has generally earned good reports from
prison staff and supervisors.

<p> She remains close to her children and is very concerned about their welfare.

<p> The Board anticipates that she will progress through the prison system by way of further reduction of her security classification.

<p> She will eventually become eligible for unescorted leave programs, which will be a final preparation for re-entry to the community.

<p> The Board supports her application for redetermination of her life sentence."

<p> A submission by counsel directly related to the welfare of the children mentioned in that summary.  It was contended that this was
an exceptional case in which the hardship suffered by the family - in distinction from the offender - should operate nevertheless
to mitigate the sentence of the offender: cf <u>R v Sarca CCA unreported 11 May 1993.</u>   One could not but be moved by a feeling of sympathy for the children but no evidence was introduced to demonstrate that their hardship
was outside the range of that which would have to be expected where one parent is imprisoned for the slaying of the other. 

<p> The applicant is not diagnosed as suffering from any mental illness or disorder.  Dr Skinner - a consulting psychiatrist - opined
that it was "unlikely that she will reoffend on release"  which must be taken to be a reference to offences generally.  Some concerns
were held, I gather, about her cardiological status and I have as best I can examined the photocopies of manuscript reports relating
to this which were tendered.  The complaints of chest pains have not led to ascertainment of any defined condition but precautionary
measures have been recommended.

<p> Ms Ramrakha observed in her report of 22 November 1994 that the applicant is "an unsure and introverted person who tends to remain
aloof."  My task is rendered the more difficult as she has virtually chosen to remain aloof in the present forensic exercise.  In
so saying I do not express lack of appreciation for the material that counsel has been able to put before me nor the helpfulness
of his submissions. 

<p> The circumstances of the crime cannot be overlooked.  The killing was planned and callous and unmitigated by any suggestion of provocation
or misconduct on the part of the deceased.  The applicant gives no indication of contrition and maintains a protestation of innocence
in the face of overwhelming evidence of her guilt.  She appears to have determined to serve her sentence in what impresses as an
almost detached quietude.  I have not overlooked her descriptions of spiritual experiences relating to her late husband but I am
unable to attribute any present relevance to these.  

<p> I conclude that she has rehabilitated in the sense that the likelihood of recidivism is remote but I am also of opinion that the
element of recognition of wrongdoing which should lie at the commencement of any truly rehabilitative process is manifestly absent
in this case.  Her future plans are vague and such knowledge as I have must be gleaned from the hearsay recountings of histories
reproduced in some of the tendered documents.   

<p> It might engender greater confidence if the applicant had chosen to elaborate but, as it is, I must do the best I can on the totality
of available material. I observe that the ratio of division into minimum and additional term mentioned in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> does not apply. 

<p> I am required by the statutory provisions already mentioned to have regard to certain previous practice relating to eligibility for
an issue for tickets of leave.  I note the information contained in Annexures A and B to the Serious Offenders Review Board (now
Council) report and take it into account.  I declare, however, the caution with which I approach elements therein in which averages
are expressed repeating, as I have frequently said of the same material in similar applications, that the much publicised 11.7 year
mean length of time before first release served by the prisoners the subject of the particular survey has been derived from a span
of incarcerations stretching from three to thirty four years.

<p> I record that I have had regard to the resentence of Phillip Cramer which occurred on 21 October 1993.  His participation in the
offence, although direct in the attempted disposal of the body, I assess as manifesting a lesser culpability than the applicant's
which I find involved inspiring the murder.  I reject Mr Green's submission that it is possible that Lucre committed the killing
without encouragement on the part of the applicant.  Although the precise content of the telephone contacts between the applicant
and Lucre are the subject of dispute between them, I have no hesitation in drawing the inference that the reason for contact can
be seen in culmination in the death of Frank Galluzzo.

<p> Kerrie Anne Galluzzo for the murder of Francis Anthony Galluzzo in substitution for the existing term of penal servitude for life
I impose a total term of sentence of sixteen years penal servitude.  This is to consist of a minimum term of eleven and one half
years to date from 21 May 1985 and to expire on 20 November 1996, together with an additional term of four and one half years commencing
on 21 November 1996.  You will be eligible for parole on 20 November 1996. </p> <!--sino noindex-->
