JUDGE1
BAINTON J:  By a summons
issued on 29 August 1994, Bradley John Cotterill
("Cotterill") sought against Bank of Singapore (Australia) Ltd, National
Australia
Bank Ltd and those persons trading in partnership as KPMG Peat
Marwick, an order that the plaintiff be awarded damages in the sum
of $17m and
costs. Cotterill in this action sues as assignee under a deed of assignment
dated 11 November 1993 made by the Official
Trustee in Bankruptcy whereby "The
Official Trustee hereby assigns to the extent permissible at law or in equity
to Bradley John
Cotterill all rights and interest in such of the choses in
action referred to in the recitals as are claimed to have vested in the
Official Trustee upon the said bankruptcy of Genness Helenea King ("King").
King is Cotterill's mother. The choses in action, according
to Recital E
consist, inter alia, of actions for breach of contract; breach of fiduciary
duty; wrongful appointment of the receiver;
trespass to and conversion of land
and personal property and the goodwill and proceeds from the business; actions
based on statutory
remedies for false and misleading conduct and negligence".
For more abundant precaution, the Recital asserts that this list "is not
intended to be exhaustive". The consideration for the assignment was $10,000
plus a covenant to pay a further 10% of the total amount
recovered "pursuant
to any Court judgment or order or out of Court settlement or which are
otherwise recovered in pursuing any of
the choses in action assigned by this
deed against the Bank ..." with a provision limiting that additional payment
to the amount
required to pay all fees, costs of administration and all proved
unsecured creditors.


2.  On 9 June 1995 Cotterill filed an amended
summons in reliance, I assume,
on Part 20, rule 2(1) of the Supreme Court rules.


3.  It is not easy to discern from either the
original summons or from the
amended summons precisely what are the causes of action on which Cotterill
relies. It is enough, however,
for present purposes to state that they fall
into, or perhaps more accurately include, two groups. One of those groups
alleges that
King was deprived of property held in the name of companies which
she controls, but asserted by her to have been held by them as
trustee for her
and therefore to be her property, by the actions of Alex McIntosh, a partner
in KPMG Peat Marwick who had been appointed
receiver to the relevant companies
by the first or the second defendants or both. The second relevant group of
complaints propounds
that the defendants engaged in misleading or deceptive
conduct in breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>. The particulars of
that allegation make it clear that a variety of misleading or deceptive
conduct is alleged against each of the
first, second and third defendants (the
latter by their "agent" McIntosh). Reliance is alleged and the loss or damage
pleaded was
that King was delayed or prevented from taking such steps as may
have been necessary to challenge the appointment "of the third defendant"
(presumably meaning McIntosh) as a receiver or to challenge the "third
defendant's" rights to possess, operate and sell all or any
assets of and at
the relevant properties. The amended summons also propounds a claim in
negligence against all of the defendants
in failing to advise King and/or the
companies to obtain independent legal advice in relation to some variation of
some unspecified
terms of "the loan facility" and in acknowledging default
under "those loan facilities". There is also a separate claim against KPMG
Peat Marwick that it was negligent in preparing reports "for the first and
second defendants".


4.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2(1)</a> does not in fact allow the amendment without leave of a
summons as distinct from a pleading. The matter was accordingly restored
to
the list to determine whether leave to file the amended summons should be
given.


5.  Each defendant in its defence to the summons
as originally filed had put
in issue Cotterill's entitlement to bring and maintain the action based on the
assignment from the Official
Trustee. If that contention were correct it would
be fatal to the proceedings brought by Cotterill. The first and second
defendants
accordingly sought to have that question determined as a separate
issue. It seemed to me to be appropriate to accede to that request
and I
ordered that "Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2</a>, there be decided separately from
any other question and before the trial of this matter, the question as to
whether the deed of
assignment between the plaintiff, King and the Official
Trustee dated 11 November 1993 was effective to assign to the plaintiff the
causes of action alleged in the summons or in the proposed amended summons".
When the matter came on for hearing on 16 June 1995,
that order was by consent
amended to read
    "Order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 2</a> that there be decided
    separately, from any other question and before the trial of this
    matter the question as to whether
the deed of assignment between
    the plaintiff, Mrs Genness Helenea King and the Official Trustee
    dated 11 November 1993 was
ineffective to assign to the plaintiff
    the causes of action alleged in the summons or in the proposed
    amended summons on
the basis that such assignment is contrary to
    public policy and is therefore invalid."


6.  The primary argument advanced by
Counsel for the Banks and supported by
Counsel for KPMG Peat Marwick was that the deed of 11 November 1993 purported
to assign a
bare cause of action and that such an assignment is contrary to
public policy and therefore ineffective to vest any right of action
in the
"assignee". The second argument advanced was that the deed evidenced an
arrangement which was champertous and accordingly
contrary to public policy
and therefore ineffective.


7.  I pause at this stage to point out that even if the first of these
submissions
were correct, it would not render the deed of 11 November 1993
completely ineffective as some of the claims assigned were claims
to have
restored interests in property alleged to have been owned by King and wrongly
divested from her. An assignment of a right
to recover property wrongly
divested has never been contrary to public policy, but an assignment of a
right to bring an action in
tort and, I would infer, to bring an action
alleging misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a> and claiming damages is contrary to public policy and would
therefore not give rise to an entitlement in the assignee to bring an
action
to enforce such a claim, but for the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>.


8.  The first edition of Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol IV published in 1908
at para 857, states the general principle this way
    "A bare right of litigation, such as a mere right to damages for a
    wrongful act, is not assignable.

    So, too, assignments
of the following kinds are void, namely, an
    assignment of the mere right to sue a trustee on the chance of
    recovering from
him some interest or profits in respect of part of
    the trust fund formerly in his hands; an assignment of a licence
    to take
possession of goods; an assignment of a right to set aside
    a deed on the grounds of fraud; and an assignment of the debt due
    from a company coupled with a right to proceed with a winding up
    petition against the company, already filed by the assignor
with a
    view to obtaining payment of the debt."


9.  For the last of these propositions, Halsbury cites, re Paris Skating Rink
Co.  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%20Ch%20D%20959" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) Ch D, 959.</a> That authority, in my respectful opinion, does not
support the proposition for which Halsbury cites it. What had happened in that
case was that a creditor presented a winding up petition; pending its being
heard, the petitioning creditor assigned his debt to
another person: on the
petition coming on to be heard the petition was amended by making the assignee
a co-petitioner and subsequently
Vice Chancellor Hall made a winding up order
on the petition of the assignee. On appeal, James LJ said
    "This is the first instance
since the Companies Acts were passed
    in which such an experiment has been tried, that is to say, of a
    creditor presenting
a petition for winding up with a view of
    obtaining payment of his debt, and then of the member of the
    company, for some purpose
or other, buying from the debtor the
    right to proceed with that petition. This has never been done
    before, and I think it
ought to be discouraged, because to my mind
    it isn't possible to foresee the amount of mischief and oppression
    that might
be occasioned if a person were allowed to come in and
    buy up the right to proceed with a winding up petition. Upon that
    simple
ground - that such a thing never has been and never ought
    to be done - I am of opinion that the Vice Chancellor's order
    ought
to be discharged."


10.  Baggally LJ agreed. Bramwell LJ, however, while he agreed in the proposed
order, pointed out that while
the debt was assignable, a right to petition for
winding up was not "because the assignor might be subject to an answer which
the
assignee was not subject to". Modern practice of course is quite to the
contrary. At most, re Paris Skating Rink Co (supra), evidences
a rule of
practice subsisting in England in the 1870s.


11.  The principal that a bare right of action is not assignable (except
where
authorised by legislation) would have the consequence that so much of King's
cause of action as is based on common law negligence,
or on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a>, which passed to the Official Trustee on the sequestration
of her estate could not have been assigned to Cotterill by the 11 November
1993 deed.


12.  There is another principle which would render the entire assignment,
unless authorised by legislation, one which
is ineffective to vest any rights
enforceable in a Court in Cotterill. That is that the deed of 11 November 1993
is plainly champertous
in that the assignee has contracted to share the
proceeds of litigating the claim with the assignor. Vol I of the first edition
of
Halsbury describes "champerty" as a particular kind of maintenance, namely,
"maintenance of an action in consideration of a promise
to give to the
maintainer a share in the subject matter or proceeds thereof". The same
volume, in para 81, describes maintenance
as "the giving of assistance or
encouragement to one of the parties to an action by a person who has neither
an interest in the action
nor any motive recognised by the law as justifying
his interference". Those principles remain alive and well and were applied by
the House of Lords in Trendtex Trading Corp. v Credit Suisse  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1982%20AC%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1982 AC 679.</a> The
facts which gave rise to that litigation are complex. The contention which
reached their Lordships was whether the English Court
in which proceedings had
been instituted should stay the action on the grounds that the issues raised
ought properly to be tried
in Switzerland. That depended on whether the
agreement in which the exclusive jurisdiction clause was contained was void as
offending
the law against champerty and maintenance (see p694A-B). The claim
in question was one which Credit Suisse had as mortgagee of the
assets of
Trendtex Trading Corp. against Central Bank of Nigeria arising out of that
Bank's failure to honour letters of credit.
Credit Suisse with the consent of
Trendtex Trading Corp. proposed to sell Trendtex's claim against Central Bank
of Nigeria to a third
party for $US800,000. That third party very shortly
thereafter settled the claim and received from Central Bank of Nigeria $US8m,
none of which found its way to Trendtex Trading Corp. Thereafter persons
claiming to be entitled to do so commenced proceedings in
the name of Trendtex
Trading Corp. claiming that the agreement for assignment was void and contrary
to public policy, it offending
against the law of champerty and maintenance.
Lord Wilberforce, at p694, after expressing the view that both Credit Suisse
and Trendtex
Trading Corp had a "genuine and substantial interest" in the
success of the litigation against the Central Bank of Nigeria, went
on to say

    "The vice, if any, of the agreement lies in the introduction of
    the third party. It appears from the face of the
agreement not as
    an obligation but as a contemplated possibility, that the cause of
    action against CBN might be sold by Credit
Suisse to a third party
    for a sum of $US800,000. This manifestly involved the possibility,
    and indeed the likelihood, of
a profit being made, either by the
    third party or possibly also by Credit Suisse out of the cause of
    action. In my opinion,
this manifestly 'savours of champerty'
    since it involves trafficking in litigation - a type of
    transaction which, under English
law, is contrary to public
    policy.

Lord Roskill at 703-4 said of the agreement which Lord Wilberforce had
discussed (it was
made on January 4 1978) 
    "... I do not ... think that Mr Brody (Counsel for Trendtex) is
    correct in criticising the judgment
of Oliver LJ on the ground
    that the learned Lord Justice failed to distinguish between the
    interest necessary to support
an assignment of a cause of action
    and the interest which would justify the maintenance of an action
    by a third party ...
The court should look at the totality of the
    transaction. If the assignment is of a property right or interest
    and the cause
of action is ancillary to that right or interest, or
    if the assignee had a genuine commercial interest in taking the
    assignment
and enforcing it for his own benefit, I see no reason
    why the assignment should be struck down as an assignment of a
    bare
cause of action or as savouring of maintenance. But, my
    Lords, to reach that conclusion ... does not mean that at least
    Article
I of the agreement of January 4 1978 is not objectionable
    as being champertous, for it is not an assignment designed to
    enable
Credit Suisse to recoup their own losses by enforcing
    Trendtex's claim against CBN to the maximum amount recoverable.
    Though
your Lordships do not have the agreement between Credit
    Suisse and the anonymous third party, it seems to me obvious, as
   
already stated, that the purpose of Article I of the agreement of
    January 4 1978 was to enable a claim against CBN to be sold
on to
    the anonymous third party for that anonymous third party to obtain
    what profit it could from it apart from paying to
Credit Suisse
    the purchase price of $US1.1m. In other words, the 'spoils',
    whatever they might be to be got from CBN were
in effect being
    divided, the first SUS1.1m going to Credit Suisse and the balance,
    whatever if might ultimately prove to
be, to the anonymous third
    party. Such an agreement, in my opinion, offends for it was a step
    towards the sale of a bare
cause of action to a third party who
    had no genuine commercial interest in the claim in return for a
    division of the spoils,
Credit Suisse taking the fixed amount
    which I have already mentioned."


13.  The principles applied by-their Lordships in Trendtex
are equally
applicable in Australia. These general law principles make it clear that the
question on which this separate issue ultimately
depends is whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">s134(1)(a)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>, empowers the Trustee to effect an assignment such
as that sought to be effected by the deed of 11 November 1993.


14.  The statutory
provision is
    "<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">s134(1)</a> Subject to this Act, a trustee may do all or any of the
    following things:

    (a) sell all or any part of the property of the
bankrupt;"


15.  There is not in the Act any specific impediment to a sale of any of that
property relevant to the present question.
The argument accordingly descends
to asserting that a power in those broad terms should be read down so as not
to extend to a sale
effected by an assignment between individuals which the
principles to which I have referred would regard as contrary to public policy
and therefore ineffective. Succinctly, it was submitted, legislation is not,
in the absence of clear words, to be interpreted as
abolishing or interfering
with basic common law doctrines. "It is a settled rule of construction that
general provisions of a statute
should only be read as abrogating common law
principals or rights to the extent made necessary by express words or
necessary intendment"
per Deane J in Baker v Campbell  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20153%20CLR%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 153 CLR 52</a> at
116.


16.  There are two answers to that contention. The first, the simplest, and a
compelling answer is that the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">s134(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act
1966</a> do not admit of any such reading down.


17.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">S58(1)(a)</a> provides:
    "Subject to this Act, where a debtor becomes a bankrupt:

    (a) the property of the bankrupt, not being after acquired
    property, vests forthwith in the Official Trustee..."


18.  The expression "property" is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(1)</a> to mean:
    "real or personal property of every description either situate in
    Australia or elsewhere, and includes any estate,
interest or
    profit, whether present or future, vested or contingent arising
    out of or incidental to any such real or personal
property."


19.  The entitlement to relief claimed in the action brought by Cotterill
depends upon rights of action, which if they
existed at all were "property",
as so defined, of King. Upon the making of the sequestration order against
King she became a bankrupt
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s43(2)).</a> The property comprising the rights of
actions thereupon vested in the Official Trustee. He thereupon became entitled
to exercise
the power conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">s134(1)(a).</a> There is no ambiguity in any of
these provisions, and no principle of construction which would authorise or
justify reading any of
them down because of any of the general law doctrines
to which I have referred.


20.  The second answer is that the language of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s134.html" class="autolink_findacts">s134(1)(a)</a> has a long history
both in England and in New South Wales, throughout the whole of which it has
been construed as empowering the
sale of any cause of action which vests in a
trustee in bankruptcy.


21.  Much of our current legislation can be traced back to
"An Act to
Consolidate and Amend the Law of Bankruptcy", 32 and 33 Vict Ch 71 ("the
Bankruptcy Act 1869") enacted for the UK on 9
August 1869 and coming into
operation (by s3) on 1 January 1870.


22.  By s14 of that Act
    "When an order has been made adjudging
a debtor bankrupt, herein
    referred to as an order of adjudication, the property of the
    bankrupt shall become divisible amongst
his creditors in
    proportion to the debts proved by them in the bankruptcy..."


23.  "Property" was defined in s4 to
    "mean
and include money, goods, things in action, land, and every
    description of property, whether real or personal; and also
    obligations,
easements, and every, description of estate, interest
    and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, arising out
    of
or incident to the property as above defined."


24.  S15 of the 1869 Act excluded from the expression "the property of the
bankrupt"
"property held on trust for any other person" and "the tools of his
trade and the necessary wearing apparel and bedding of himself
his wife and
children". It was, by the same section, expressly defined to comprise
    "(3) All such property as may belong to or
be vested in the
    bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy..."


25.  S25(6) provided
    "Subject to the provisions of
this Act, the Trustee shall have
    power to do the following things:

    (6) To sell all the property of the bankrupt (including
the
    goodwill of the business, if any, and the book debts due or
    growing due to the bankrupt) by public auction or private
    contract, with power, if he thinks fit, to transfer the whole
    thereof to any person or company, or to sell the same in parcels;"


26.  S111 of the 1869 Act provided
    "Any, person to whom anything in action belonging to the bankrupt
    is assigned in pursuance
of this Act may bring or defend any
    action or suit relating to such thing in action in his own name."


27.  The effect of the
provisions of The Bankruptcy Act 1869 was considered by
the Court of Common Pleas in Kitson v Hardwick  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1872%20LR%207%20CP%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1872 LR 7 CP 473.</a> The plaintiff
in that case sued for the price of goods sold and delivered. The defendant
pleaded that since that cause of action
arose and before the present case
commenced, the estate of the plaintiff was sequestrated under The Bankruptcy
Act 1869. The plaintiff
replied that after that sequestration the Trustee for
good and valuable consideration sold assigned and transferred back to him all
the estate causes of action etc. vested in the Trustee in the bankruptcy. I
should interpose at this stage to say that there seems
not in fact to have
been a sequestration order but a liquidation by arrangement under s125 of the
1869 Act. Subsection 7 of that
section gives the trustee under such an
arrangement the same powers and duties as a trustee under a bankruptcy and
provides that
the property of the debtor is to be distributed in the same
manner as in a bankruptcy and it applies all of the provisions of the
Act so
far as they are applicable to an arrangement under s125.


28.  Willes J in his judgment said:
    "The Act of Parliament
by s125(5) vests all the property of the
    bankrupt (or the person whose estate is in liquidation) in the
    trustee, and there
must be some statutory authority for any other
    person than the trustee suing therefor. That is found in s25(5)
    (either Willes
J or the reporter has by mistake referred to
    subsection 5 instead of subsection 61 which empowers the trustee
    to sell all
the property and book debts of the bankrupt, and in
    s111, which enables the transferee to sue in respect of them in
    his own
name. Even without this latter provision, I should have
    thought the right to sue would exist; for, where the law allows
    the
assignment of a chose in action, the power to bring an action
    in respect of it necessarily follows. However, there is that
 
  express provision in s111 that 'any person to whom any thing in
    action belonging to the bankrupt is assigned in pursuance of
this
    Act, may bring or defend any action or suit relating to such thing
    in his own name'. The plaintiff, therefore, provided
he is a
    person to whom it was competent for the trustee to sell this debt,
    may bring an action to recover it in his own name."

Keating J concurred.


29.  In 1880 the case of Seear v Lawson came before the Chancery Division and
subsequently the Court of Appeal
on appeal from Vice Chancellor Bacon. It is
reported in (1880) LR 15 Ch D p426. The headnote reads
    "The trustee in bankruptcy
of a man who had conveyed away some
    real property absolutely commenced an action against the grantee
    to have it declared
that the conveyance was a mortgage, and that
    the deed ought to stand as a security only for the money advanced.
    The action
had proceeded no further than the issue of the writ,
    when the trustee sold and assigned the subject matter of the
    action
to a purchaser for value;

    Held, by Bacon VC, and by the Court of Appeal, that the assignee
    from the trustee in bankruptcy
was entitled to continue the
    action.

    Whether such a right could not have been assigned by, the grantor
    himself quaere."


30.  Before Vice Chancellor Bacon, Sir Henry Jackson QC's submission was
    "It will be argued on the other side that what has
been conveyed
    is only an equity of redemption. But that is not what was
    conveyed. The equity redemption, we say, is gone,
and the suit is
    an attempt to get it back again. That is a law suit; and the
    assignment of it, though not quite champerty,
nor quite
    maintenance, is so like one or both, and so offensive, that the
    Court never gives effect to it."


31.  He is recorded,
at p429, as having put it more succinctly in reply. He is
reported to have submitted
    "It was not the property that was sold,
only a law suit.


32.  Vice Chancellor Bacon held that the assignment was effective and that the
action should continue. That, he
held, was the effect of ss25 and 111. On
appeal Jessel MR said (at p432-3)
    "The first proposition of the Appellant is, that Mr
Webster, the
    bankrupt, could not himself have conveyed or assigned this right
    or thing in action. I will assume that he could
not, but without
    intending to decide that he could not, for it might be put that he
    was the owner of the equity of redemption,
though he could only
    establish his right to it by setting aside the deed.

    Now the word property, as defined by the 4th section
of the
    Bankruptcy Act, includes things in action. The trustee obtains the
    bankrupt's property under the 17th section on his
appointment. The
    words are, 'on the appointment of a trustee the property shall
    forthwith pass to and vest in the trustee
appointed, and he gets
    the property in no other way.

    The first question to be decided is, does he get such a right of
 
  action as this under the 17th section? I should say it is quite
    clear that he does. It would be impossible to hold that it
    remained vested in the bankrupt so that he could after his
    discharge recover the estate for his own benefit. Therefore, under
    the words Property', it vests in the trustee and is now in the
    trustee. It is in the trustee by a statutory transfer, and
for
    this purpose I assume that such a right could not have been
    transferred apart from the statute. Then the 25th section
enables
    the trustee 'to sell all the property of the bankrupt including,
    etc. It is suggested that the word Property' in
the 25th section
    is to have a different meaning from that which it has in the 17th
    section. I cannot see why. It is the same
word and under the same
    definition clause. If the trustee gets a right of action, why is
    he not to realise it? The proper
office of the trustee is to
    realise the property for the sake of distributing the proceeds
    amongst the creditors. Why should
we hold as a matter of policy
    that it is necessary for him to sue in his own name? He may have
    no funds, or he may be disinclined
to run the risk of having to
    pay costs, or he may consider it undesirable to delay the
    winding-up of the bankruptcy till
the end of the litigation.
    Considering these things, it seems to me to be a priori probable
    that he would be entitled to
sell it, but I prefer to rest my
    decision upon the plain words of the statute. The words are, 'all
    the property', and it
does not appear to me that we have any right
    to exclude from the plain provision of the 25th section anything
    which has passed
to the trustee under the 17th section."


James LJ said
    "I am entirely of the same opinion.

    Whatever was vested in the trustee
it seems to me that the trustee
    is authorised by, the Act to sell, and he is entitled to sell
    instead of incurring the risk
of litigation in his own name, and
    at his own expense. Supposing this were a right which never was in
    Mr Webster at all;
supposing, for instance, that the trustee had a
    right to impeach a deed by reason of its being a fraud upon the
    creditors,
although it was a deed of which Webster himself could
    not have complained, that right would, in my opinion, have been
    equally
saleable by the trustee as being part of the assets and
    property which the trustee was to get in for the benefit of the
    creditors.
desire to add, that although we decide this case upon
    the assumption that such a right as this could not have been
    assigned
by Mr Webster himself, I am by no means prepared to
    assent to the proposition that it could not."

Brett LJ said
    "Assuming
this to be a mere right to bring an action, it seems to
    me that it could not pass to the trustee except by some enactment
  
 in the Bankruptcy Act. I think it did pass to the trustee, and Sir
    Henry Jackson was perfectly, right in admitting at first
that it
    did, although he afterwards retracted that admission. It does
    pass, and if so, then it passes by some word in the
statute. What
    word? Under the word 'property' in the 17th section. Then if
    'property' in the 17th section includes this right,
does the
    phrase 'all the property' in the 25th section include it? Why
    should it not? According to ordinary rules of construction
we have
    no right to construe the same word in the same statute in a
    different manner or with different limitations, unless
there is
    some context which enables us to do so. It is said that a
    limitation is to be introduced into the 25th section,
because the
    assignment of such a right as this is against public policy. I do
    not think that that argument can be maintained,
and therefore the
    word 'property' must have the same signification in the 25th
    section as in the 17th section, and if so,
it includes this right
    of action." (Underlining mine)


 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=33%20Act%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">33.  Act 46</a> and 47 Vict, Ch 52 entitled "An Act to Amend and Consolidate the
Law of Bankruptcy" ("the Bankruptcy Act 1883") was enacted on 25
August 1883.
This Act defined the expression "property" (in s168) in terms identical to the
definition of the expression "property"
in s4 of the 1869 Act, except that it
made it clear that the definition extended to property whether situated in
England or elsewhere.
By s54(1) of the 1883 Act, immediately on a debtor being
adjudged bankrupt, the property of the bankrupt vested in the official
receiver
and then on the appointment of a trustee, it passed forthwith to and
vested in that trustee. S56 of the 1883 Act provided
    "Subject
to the provisions of this Act, the trustee may do all or
    any of the following things:

    1. Sell all or any, part of the property
of the bankrupt
    (including the goodwill of the business, if any, and the book
    debts due or growing due to the bankrupt),
by public auction or
    private contract with power to transfer the whole thereof to any
    person or company or to sell the same
in parcels. "


34.  The Bankruptcy Act 1883 repealed the 1869 Act (see 5th Schedule), but as
the provisions to which I have drawn
attention indicate, it re-enacted those
provisions of the 1869 Act defining what was meant by property of the bankrupt
and empowering
the trustee to deal with that property.


35.  The provisions of the 1883 Act were considered by Chitty J in Guy v
Churchill  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%20LR%2040%20ChD%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) LR 40 Ch.D, 481.</a> In that case a firm Guy and Co. who were
timber merchants, brought an action against the defendants, their agents for
the sale of
timber, asserting a right to recover what was in substance
asserted to be an unauthorised profit made in the course of an agency
transaction. The action was lost at first instance, apparently because the
trial judge refused to give leave to amend. On appeal
leave was given to
amend; presumably the action was remitted for determination on the amended
pleadings, but before that rehearing
the plaintiffs were adjudicated bankrupt.
After that adjudication the trustee Kemp entered into an indenture with Ford,
himself a
creditor in the bankruptcy and acting as trustee for himself and
other creditors, by which Kemp assigned to Ford as such trustee
all the rights
of Kemp as such trustee of the estate of Guy and Co. to carry on that action,
but only in Ford's own name. The indenture
also provided that if and when Ford
recovered by virtue of any final judgment or compromise any sum of money in
respect of the claim
in the action, that he Ford would forthwith pay over to
Kemp as trustee of the bankrupt firm or other then trustee of that firm,
one
fourth part of the net amount of the moneys after deducting costs and
expenses.


36.  Ford under the then procedures of the
Court obtained an order as of
course to carry on the proceedings and the defendants applied to discharge the
order on the grounds
that the deed was champertous. In the course of his
judgment, Chitty J said (at p486-7
    "Two points are clear, and the argument
for the motion proceeded
    on the admission of Counsel that they were indisputable. The first
    is, that the right to continue
the action passed to Kemp as
    trustee in bankruptcy. The second is, that Kemp was entitled to
    sell this right even to a stranger.
Both points are covered by the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in Seear v Lawson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=15%20Ch%20D%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">15 Ch D 426.</a>

He later said
    "The decision (Seear v Lawson) was founded upon the definition in
    the Bankruptcy Act then under consideration
of the term 'property'
    which included things in action. The Act of 1883, which applies to
    the case before me, is similar
in terms."

And later
    "It is clear, then, that the deed of 1883 which was made with the
    sanction of the Committee of Inspection,
cannot be impeached
    merely on the ground of maintenance. Any objections on that ground
    are removed by the Bankruptcy Act,
1883, quite apart from any
    considerations based on relations of the parties.

    But it was urged that it is void for champerty.
It was said that
    the statutory powers conferred on the trustees by s57(8) to sell a
    chose in action, and to 'make such compromise
or other arrangement
    as may be thought expedient with respect to any claim arising out
    of or incidental to the property of
the bankrupt, made or capable
    of being made on the trustee by any person or by the trustee on
    any person' empowered the trustee
to make only a lawful sale or a
    lawful arrangement. But this is merely a repetition of the
    argument which was distinctly
negatived in Seear v Lawson. The
    argument is far too wide to be sustained.


    But it remains to be considered in its more
limited form as
    confined to champerty. It is difficult to find any sufficient
    reason for saying that the statute which makes
lawful an
    arrangement which, apart from its provisions, would be unlawful on
    the ground of maintenance, does not also make
lawful an
    arrangement open to the objection of champerty. The policy of the
    statute is to give power to the trustee, with
the sanction of the
    Committee, to make arrangements in reference to choses in action
    which are considered beneficial to the
creditors. It would be a
    strange and inconsistent result to say, that although the right of
    action may be sold out and out
it cannot be disposed of on the
    terms that some part of the fruit of the action successful shall
    come back to the bankrupt's
estate for division among his
    creditors."


37.  When the first edition of Halsbury's Laws of England was published (in
1908),
The Bankruptcy Act 1883 was still in force though amended by 52 and 54
Vict Ch 71 (1890). The authors of the section on Bankruptcy
and Insolvency,
when dealing, in volume 2, with the powers and duties of a trustee in
bankruptcy, exercised with or without the consent
of the Committee felt able
simply to assert "The trustee may sell a right of action (Seear v Lawson
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2015%20Ch%20D%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 15 Ch D 426</a>, Guy v Churchill  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2040%20Ch%20D%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 40 Ch D 481).</a> He may sell to the
bankrupt himself. Kitson v Hardwick  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%20LR%207%20CP%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) LR 7 CP 473".</a>


38.  Kitson v Hardwick, Seear v Lawson and Guy v Churchill were all considered
by the Court of Appeal in England in Ramsay v Hartley
and Ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20WLR%20686" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1 WLR
686.</a> In that case Ramsay sued five defendants, the fifth being a firm of
chartered accountants. The claim against the accountants was
for damages for
negligence of the type considered in Hedley Byrne and Co. Ltd v Heller and
Partners Ltd <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] UKHL 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1964%20AC%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1964 AC 465.</a> After the writ was issued Ramsay was adjudged
bankrupt. There was a relation back of the commencement of the bankruptcy but
to a
date after the issue of the writ. The Act then in force was The
Bankruptcy Act 1914. Later the trustee in bankruptcy assigned the
right of
action against the accountants back to Ramsay, a term being that if Ramsay
succeeded he would pay to the trustee 35% of
the net proceeds. The questions
argued (relevant to the present judgment), and the Court of Appeal's decision,
can most readily be
perceived from the judgment of Lane LJ at p699. He said
    "The facts of this case have already been sufficiently explained.
  
 There is no need for me to reiterate them. The answers to the
    various problems raised by those facts are to be found almost
    entirely within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act 1914.

    By s38 of that Act the property of the bankrupt divisible amongst
    his creditors comprises, inter alia, subject to certain
    exceptions:

    '... all such property as may belong to or be vested
in the
    bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy, or may be acquired
    by or devolve on him before his discharge;...'

    'Property' is defined in s167 to include:

    'money, goods, things in action, land, and every description of
    property,
whether real or personal and whether situate in England
    or elsewhere; also obligations, easements, and every description
   
of estate, interest, and profit, present or future, vested or
    contingent, arising out of or incident to property as above
  
 defined.'


    There is no dispute that these words are wide enough to cover and
    do cover the bankrupt's right of action in
tort against the fifth
    defendant, who is the appellant before this court. Accordingly, on
    adjudication the right of action
became vested in the trustee.
    S55(1) enables the trustee to do the following things: 'Sell all
    or any part of the property
of the bankrupt, ... by ... private
    contract, with power to transfer the whole thereof to any
    person...'. This must include
the power to dispose of or assign
    any thing in action. The fact that the word 'sell' may, not be
    entirely appropriate to
the transfer of a thing in action is to my
    mind immaterial. It would not be consistent with the objects of
    the Act that the
trustee should be unable to alienate for the
    benefit of the creditors what may be a valuable asset.

    The trustee can therefore
assign the thing in action to 'any
    person'. These words could scarcely, be wider. It is, however,
    submitted by counsel for
the appellant that the words 'any,
    person' must be qualified by reading into s55(1) the words 'except
    the bankrupt himself'.
I can see no warrant for so restricting the
    plain meaning of the words. If it is necessary to seek authority,
    it is to be
found in the judgment of Willes J in Kitson v
    Hardwick,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=LR%207%20CP%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">LR 7 CP 473.</a>

    Was the assignment void as contrary, to the rules of champerty and
    maintenance? Although the Criminal Law Act 1967 abolished
both
    champerty and maintenance, by s13 as crimes and by s14(1) as
    torts, it appears to preserve their effect otherwise in
the
    following terms (s14(2)):

    'The abolition of criminal and civil liability ... for maintenance
    and champerty shall
not affect any rule ... as to cases in which a
    contract is to be treated as contrary to public policy or
    otherwise illegal.'

    The question was decided in Guy v Churchill  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=40%20Ch%20D%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">40 Ch D 481</a>, a
    judgment of Chitty, J in a case where the trustee had assigned to
    a creditor. Chitty J followed the earlier decision in
Seear v
    Lawson,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=15%20Ch%20D%20426" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">15 Ch D 426</a>, holding that the assignment was valid having
    regard to the special provisions of the Bankruptcy, Act 1883. The
    relevant
parts of the Act of 1914 do not differ materially from
    the equivalent sections of the Act of 1883, and the present
    assignment,
just as the deed in that case, cannot be impeached on
    the ground of maintenance or champerty."


39.  I turn now to the NSW legislation
and begin with The Bankruptcy Act 1887
51 Vict No. 19 "An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Law Relating to Insolvency
and Bankruptcy..."
assented to on 13 December 1887. S3 of that Act defined
"property" as
    "includes money, goods, things in action, land, and every
    description of property, whether real or personal and whether
    situate in New South Wales or elsewhere; also obligations,
present
    or future, vested or contingent, arising out of or incident to
    property as above defined:"


40.  The effect of the
making of a sequestration order is set out in s10(1).
Relevantly it vested in the official assignee named in the order
    "absolutely
or for such estate or interest as the bankrupt had
    therein, all real and personal property of the bankrupt...".


41.  S52 indicates
that this property included
    "the capacity to exercise and take proceedings for exercising all
    such powers in or over or in
respect of property as might have
    been exercised for the bankrupt at the commencement of his
    bankruptcy...".


42.  S59(4)
is even clearer. It provided
    "where any, part of the property, of the bankrupt consists of
    things in action, such things
shall be deemed to be assignable and
    to have been duly assigned to the official assignee,... ".


43.  Ss63 and 64 deal with
the powers of the official assignee; s64 those
which may be exercised with the permission of the committee of inspection, and
s63
those which may be exercised without any such permission. S64(12) empowers
the trustee to "sell any part of the property of the bankrupt
(including the
goodwill of the business, if any, and the book debts due or growing due to the
bankrupt) by private sale. S63(1) empowers
the sale of property described in
the same terms "by public auction".


44.  The Bankruptcy Act 1887 was amended by Act 52 Vict No
XI in July 1888 and
by Act 60 Vict No XXIX in November 1896. Neither of these Acts made any
change, relevant to the present question,
to the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act 1887.


45.  The Bankruptcy Act No XXV of 1898 was assented to on 27 July 1898. It is
entitled
"An Act to Consolidate the Law relating to Bankruptcy".


46.  S3(1) provides that the term "property"
    "includes money, goods,
things in action, land, and every
    description of property, whether real or personal, and whether
    situate in New South Wales
or elsewhere; also, obligations,
    easements, and every description of estate, interest and profit,
    present or future, vested
or contingent, arising out of or
    incident to property as above defined:"


47.  S10(1) provides
    "Upon the making of a sequestration
order the property of the
    bankrupt shall vest in one of the official assignees to be named
    in such order, and be divisible
among the creditors of the
    bankrupt in accordance with the provisions of this Act."


48.  S52 sets out what is and is not the
property of the bankrupt divisible
among his creditors. It provides:
    "The property of the bankrupt divisible amongst his creditors,
and
    in this Act referred to as the property of the bankrupt, shall not
    comprise the following particulars:

    (a) Property
held by the bankrupt on trust for any other person:

    (b) The tools (if any) of his trade, and the necessary, wearing
    apparel
and bedding of himself, his wife and children, to a value,
    inclusive of tools and apparel and bedding, not exceeding twenty

   pounds in the whole:

    But it shall comprise the following particulars:

    (c) All such property as may, belong to or be
vested in the
    bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy, or may be acquired
    by or devolve on him before his discharge;
and

    (d) The capacity to exercise and to take proceedings for
    exercising all such powers in or over or in respect of property
as
    might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit at
    the commencement of his bankruptcy or before his discharge;
and

    (e) All goods being, at the commencement of the bankruptcy or at
    any time between that time and the date of the order
of
    sequestration in the possession, order, or disposition of the
    bankrupt, by the consent and permission of the true owner,
under
    such circumstances that he is the reputed owner thereof; provided
    that things in action other than debts due or growing
due to the
    bankrupt in the course of his trade or business shall not be
    deemed goods within the meaning of this section."


49.  S59 is in Division 5 "Realisation of Property" of Part II "Administration
of Property".


50.  S59(4) provides
    "Where
any part of the property, of the bankrupt consists of
    things in action, such things shall be deemed to be assignable and
   
to have been duly assigned to the official assignee; and the
    official assignee, or the trustee in the event of the estate of
    the official assignee vesting in a trustee, may sue in any Court
    in the name of the bankrupt, or continue any action or suit
begun
    by the bankrupt at the date of the sequestration order."


51.  S63(1) (also in Part II, Division 5) provides
    "Subject
to the provisions of this Act the official assignee or
    trustee may

    (1) do all or any of the following things ... sell all
or any part
    of the properly of the bankrupt (including the goodwill of the
    business, if any, and the book debts due or growing
due to the
    bankrupt) by public auction, with power to transfer the whole
    thereof to any person or company or to sell the
same in parcels."

And s64(12) provides
    "The official assignee or trustee may, with the permission of the
    committee of inspection

    (12) Sell all or any part of the property of the bankrupt
    (including the goodwill of the business, if any,) and the book
    debts due or growing due to the bankrupt) by private sale."


52.  This remained the law relating to bankruptcy in New South
Wales until the
Commonwealth Bankruptcy Act 1924 was proclaimed to commence. The New South
Wales legislation is plainly modelled
on the UK legislation which preceded it.
Indeed, it has reproduced much of the language of the UK legislation. The
reasoning which
led to the decision in Kitson v Hardwick, Seear v Lawson and
Guy v Churchill (supra) was as applicable in New South Wales when its
bankruptcy legislation was enacted, as it was in England when those cases were
decided on the UK legislation as it then was. The
underlying policy of the
legislation is plain: it is that all the property of a bankrupt (with
specified exceptions) should pass
to the functionary, by whatever name called,
whose task it was to get in that property, to realise it and to distribute the
net realisation
among the creditors. To the extent that the property of the
bankrupt included or consisted of a chose in action (whether a "bare"
chose in
action, or one flowing from some property right) the legislation provided that
it should pass to the functionary who was
to realise it for the benefit of the
bankrupt's creditors. And the realisation may be by "sale"; the form of the
price was a matter
for the functionary to determine: it could include sharing
the fruits of litigation. If there were any doubt about those propositions
(I
do not think there is) the repetition of the provisions construed in Seear v
Lawson and the other authorities to which I have
referred without any changes
to them (other than minor rearrangement) would of itself require the later
statutes to be construed
in accordance with those decisions.


53.  I come now to the Federal law, as in force since the date on which the
Bankruptcy Act
1924 was proclaimed to commence.


54.  S4 of The Bankruptcy Act 1924 defines "property" to include
    "money, goods, things in
action, land, and every description of
    property, whether real or personal and whether situate in
    Australia or elsewhere;
also obligations, easements, and every
    description of estate, interest and profit, present or future,
    vested or contingent,
arising out of or incident to property as
    above defined;"


55.  S91 set out what was "the property of the bankrupt" divisible
among his
creditors. It included
    "(i) all property which belongs to or is vested in the bankrupt at
    the commencement of bankruptcy,
or is acquired by or devolves on
    him before his discharge;

    (ii) the capacity to exercise, and to take proceedings for
 
  exercising, all such powers in or over or in respect of property
    as might have been exercised by, the bankrupt for his own
benefit
    at the commencement of the bankruptcy or before his discharge;"


56.  S105 gives to the trustee power, inter alia, to
    "Sell all or any part of the property of the bankrupt (including
    the goodwill of the business, if any, and the book debts
due or
    growing due to the bankrupt), by public auction or public tender,
    with power to transfer the whole thereof to any
person or company,
    or to sell the same in parcels;"


57.  S107(a) gives to the trustee power "by permission of the creditors
by
resolution passed at any general meeting or of the Committee of Inspection or
by leave of the Court", to
    "Carry on the business
of the bankrupt, so far as may be necessary
    for its beneficial winding-up, or sell, by private contract, all
    or any part
of the property of the bankrupt (including the
    goodwill of the business if any, and the book debts due or growing
    due to
the bankrupt) with power to transfer the whole thereof to
    any person or company or to sell the same in parcels;"


58.  Finally,
I come to the provisions of the present Commonwealth Act, the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>, first, as it was in 1966 and secondly as it was on 11
November 1993.


59.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">S5(1)</a> contained a definition of "property". It was
    "Property' means real or personal property of every, description,
    whether situate
in Australia or elsewhere, and includes any
    estate, interest or profit, whether present or future, vested or
    contingent,
arising out of or incident to any such real or
    personal property;"


60.  That definition remained unchanged up to (and after)
11 November 1993.


61.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">S58(1)(a)</a> provided
    "Subject to this Act where a debtor becomes a bankrupt

    (a) the property of the bankrupt, not being after-acquired
    property, vests forthwith in The Official Receiver in Bankruptcy."


62.  This definition has been slightly amended. On 11 November
1993 (and
still) it provided
    "Subject to the Act, where a debtor becomes a bankrupt:

    (a) the property of the bankrupt, not
being after acquired
    property, vests forthwith in the Official Trustee or, if, at the
    time when the debtor becomes a bankrupt,
a registered trustee
    becomes the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt by virtue of
    s156A, in that registered trustee;"


63.  S132(1) provided
    "Subject to this section, where a trustee is appointed by the
    creditors, the property, of the bankrupt
passes to and vests in
    the trustee so appointed on the day, on which the appointment
    takes effect."


64.  On 11 November
1993 (and still) it so provided with the addition, after
the words "section" the words "and to s158". (S158 deals with the appointment
of two or more registered trustees jointly, or jointly and severally).


65.  S134(1)(a) and (2) provided
    "(1) Subject to this
Act, the trustees may do all or any of the
    following things:

    (a) sell all or any part of the property of the bankrupt;

    (2) Paragraph (a) of the last preceding subsection does not
    authorise the trustee to sell by private contract any property
    having a value exceeding Ten thousand dollars."


66.  By 11 November 1993 this subsection had been amended to refer to "any
property having a net value exceeding the prescribed amount".


67.  S135(1) provided
    "The trustee may, with the permission of
the creditors granted by,
    resolution passed at a meeting of the creditors, with the
    permission of the committee of inspection
or with the leave of the
    Court, do all or any, of the following things:

    (a) sell, by private contract any property of the
bankrupt having
    a net value exceeding $10,000;

    (b) accept, without terms or conditions, or subject to terms and
    conditions,
a sum of money payable at a future time as the
    consideration or part of the consideration for the sale of any,
    property of
the bankrupt;"


68.  By 11 November 1993 the $10,000 had increased to $20,000 or such greater
sum as is prescribed for the purposes
of s134.


69.  This examination of the New South Wales and of the Commonwealth
legislation leads me to conclude, first that both
were modelled upon the UK
legislation commencing with The Bankruptcy Act 1869; secondly that the
construction put upon that Act by
the English decisions to which I have
referred is equally applicable to and should be put upon the present
Commonwealth Act; thirdly
that property of the bankrupt as defined in s5(1) of
the present Commonwealth legislation which passes to the Official Trustee and
which may be realised by him includes what may be described as a bare chose in
action such as one relying upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> and
finally, for the reasons enunciated by Brett LJ in Seear v Lawson and by
Chitty J in Guy v Churchill that the bankruptcy legislation
authorises a
disposal which would, apart from such legislation, be champertous and for that
reason not recognisable by any Court.


70.  I should at this stage record that in Re Nguyen, Ex parte Official
Trustee in Bankruptcy  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2032%20FLR%20320" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 32 FLR 320</a>, French J, in determining whether to
grant leave to the Official Trustee pursuant to s135(1)(b) of the 1964 Act to
sell an asset
of the bankrupt estate being a right of action against a Bank,
in consideration of the promise to pay 50% of net proceeds recovered,
also
expressed the opinion that a cause of action based on s52A, and a cause of
action based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> could be assigned by an
Official Trustee for a price being a share of the proceeds recovered. As His
Honour's decision was simply
that he was satisfied that the Court had power to
grant leave for the proposed sale rather than that such a sale would
effectively
vest the cause of action in the assignee, I have thought it proper
to examine that question afresh rather than simply follow his
Honour's
decision.


71.  My conclusion accordingly is that the deed of 11 November 1993 assigned
to Cotterill all of the causes
of action (assuming them to exist) vested in
King at the commencement of her bankruptcy.


72.  I therefore answer the separate question,
in its amended form, "No".


73.  I order that the first and second defendants pay the costs of the
plaintiff of the determination
of this separate question. I make no order in
respect of the costs of the third defendants. For the guidance of the
assessing officer
I record that the argument on this separate question
occupied no more than 1.5 hours on 16 June 1995, the balance of that day being
devoted to whether or not the amended summons should be allowed to remain on
the file. That question remains undetermined, the plaintiff
having decided to
endeavour to produce an amended summons devoid of the many shortcomings
levelled (and properly so) at the present
"amended summons".
