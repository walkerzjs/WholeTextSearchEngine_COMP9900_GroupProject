<u>REGINA  v  GRAHAME JAMES DAUBNEY</u>      <u>REGINA  v  GRAHAME JAMES
DAUBNEY</u><p>
070057/92  70081/93 <p>
Friday 26 November 1993<p>
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES CRIMINAL DIVISION<br>JAMES J<br><p>
<b>SENTENCE</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 21 October 1993 Grahame James Daubney pleaded guilty
before me to a charge on an indictment presented by the Commonwealth Director
of Public Prosecutions that between 6 February 1986 and 24 May 1990 he was
knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia
of prohibited imports to
which s233B of the Customs Act applied, namely a quantity of heroin being not
less than the commercial quantity
of heroin.<p>
	The prisoner had been committed for trial on fifteen separate charges of being
knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin.
 Without any objection by the
prisoner the fifteen charges on which he was committed for trial were "rolled
up" or combined into
the one charge to which he pleaded guilty before me.<p>
	By virtue of ss233B and 235 of the Customs Act the penalty for the offence to
which the prisoner pleaded guilty is imprisonment
for life or for such period
as the court thinks appropriate.<p>
	I have been asked to take into account pursuant to s16BA of the Commonwealth
Crimes Act, and I will take into account in passing
sentence on the prisoner,
five offences committed by the prisoner under the Passports Act, 1938, of
having in his control an Australian
passport that had been falsified or a
British passport that had been falsified or of making a false statement for the
purpose of
obtaining an Australian passport.<p>
	The prisoner also pleaded guilty before me on 21 October 1993 to a charge on
an indictment presented by the State Director of Public
Prosecutions that
between 18 April 1990 and 24 April 1990 at Sydney he supplied a prohibited
drug, heroin.  This is an offence under
s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and
Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty is a fine of two thousand penalty
units or imprisonment
for fifteen years, or both.<p>
	The sentence hearings for the Commonwealth offence and for the State offence
took place concurrently before me without any objection
by counsel for the
prisoner.  The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the State
Director of Public Prosecutions were
separately represented.<p>
	There was placed before me in the proceedings on sentence a comprehensive
facts statement prepared by the Commonwealth.  No challenge
was made to any
part of the document by counsel for the prisoner and my statement of the facts
of the Commonwealth offence is taken
from this document.<p>
	Between February 1986 and April 1990 the prisoner made at least sixteen
overseas trips.  I will deal later in these remarks with
the question of
whether he made more than sixteen overseas trips during this period.<p>
	The Crown accepted that on one of the sixteen overseas trips, the tenth trip
made to Hawaii in December 1988, the prisoner was not
concerned in the
importation of drugs into Australia.  On each of the other fifteen trips the
prisoner was knowingly concerned in
the importation of heroin into Australia
from Thailand.  These fifteen separate occasions were the subject of the
fifteen separate
charges on which the prisoner was committed for trial and
which were later combined into the one comprehensive charge to which he
pleaded
guilty.   On each of these fifteen occasions, apart from the first, the
prisoner travelled under a false name and used a
passport that had been
falsified.  The use of false passports gave rise to the charges under the
Passports Act.<p>
	On all, or at least most, of the occasions on which heroin was imported into
Australia the prisoner, who operated alone, used the
same method fro importing
the heroin.  The prisoner bought heroin in Singapore;  he took the heroin to a
condominium he owned at
Pattaya in Thailand;  he bought cheap paintings at a
tourist shop near the condominium;  he took the backing off each of the
paintings;
 he pressed heroin into the cavity with a bookbinding press;  he
reglued the backing onto the back of each binding;  he bought a
greeting card
and wrote on the card a personal message and then he posted parcels each
containing a number of paintings and a card,
addressed to some named fictitious
person, care of a post office in Australia.  he made a list of all the names
and addresses of
the addressees and posted the list addressed to himself at his
Australian address.  He then travelled back to Australia, waited a
few days and
using the list he had posted to himself, he went to the various post offices
and collected the parcels.<p>
	On 10 April 1990 an officer of the Federal police examined one of the parcels
sent by the prisoner at a Sydney post office.  The
officer removed the
cardboard backing of one of the paintings and found in a cavity in the back of
the painting a plastic bag containing
sixty grams of heroin of a high degree of
purity.<p>
	On 11 April 1990 Federal police executed a search warrant at the prisoner's
home at Carlingford.  During the search police found
half a dozen cardboard
backed paintings each of which was found on examination to contain sixty grams
of heroin.<p>
	Over the next six weeks Federal police seized and examined a number of other
parcels containing paintings in which heroin had been
concealed, which had been
posted by the prisoner from south-east Asia.<p>
	The total amount of heroin concealed in paintings seized by the police on 10
April 1990, 11 April 1990 and over the next six weeks
had a gross weight of
2,037.7 grams with an average purity of 77 per cent, making a total weight of
pure heroin of 1,571.30 grams,
that is more than one and a half kilograms.<p>
	The prisoner was arrested on 11 April 1990 and refused bail.  Between 14 April
1990 and 24 April 1990 the prisoner shared a cell
at the Sydney Police Centre
with an informant named West.  On three occasions West was fitted by police
with a listening device.
 In conversations with West, particularly on 17 April
1990 and 23 April 1990, the prisoner made admissions abut his importations
of
heroin.<p>
	On or about 19 April the prisoner told West that he could supply a friend of
West's with good quality heroin and that it would be
no problem to supply a
pound of heroin.  The prisoner told West that he would arrange for his wife,
that is the prisoner's wife,
to pass on to West's friend the telephone number
of an associate of the prisoner's who would actually deliver the heroin.  The
prisoner
told West that the price of one pound of heroin would be $130,000.
The prisoner contacted his wife and arranged for his wife and
his associate to
visit him at the Sydney Police Centre for the purpose of bringing about the
delivery of the heroin.<p>
	This offer by the prisoner to supply heroin was the subject of the State
charge of supplying heroin in contravention of s25 of the
Drug Misuse and
Trafficking Act.  No actual delivery of heroin took place.<p>
	The tape recordings of the conversations between the prisoner and West were
played to the prisoner on 4 May 1990.  After the last
tape had been played the
prisoner said, "I have got a big mouth, haven't I?"  He admitted that what he
had said on the tapes was
correct and he initialled the tapes. <p>
	I have already stated that between February 1986 and April 1990 the prisoner
made at least fifteen overseas trips on each of which
he imported heroin.  In a
recorded conversation between the prisoner and West on 17 April 1990 West said,
"You say you're done over
thirty trips", meaning trips on which the prisoner
had imported heroin, to which the prisoner said, "Yeah, probably, yeah".<p>
	It was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that I could not be satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner made as many
as thirty trips on which
he imported heroin on the basis of this less than fully positive answer by the
prisoner to a leading question
by West, an answer which may have been a
boasting exaggeration by the prisoner.  Furthermore, counsel for the
Commonwealth Crown
expressly stated that he did not submit that I could be
satisfied to the requisite standard that the prisoner made any more than
fifteen trips on which he had imported heroin.  I will accordingly sentence the
prisoner on the basis that he made fifteen overseas
trips on which he imported
heroin.<p>
	It is also not possible to determine precisely just how much heroin the
prisoner imported.  In one part of the recorded conversation
between the
prisoner and West on 17 April 1990 the prisoner said that he had imported two
kilograms every trip.  However, in another
part of the same conversation the
prisoner said:-<p>
<p>
	"See, only one, two Ks all the time the last couple of years, before that we
done, he was scoring and I was bringing back like only
maybe a pound.  So it is
not as much as, (and the following word or words are indecipherable)".<p>
<p>
	The prisoner said other things to West to the effect that the scale of his
operations was greater at the end than it was at the
beginning.<p>
	As I have already stated, the police found a gross weight of just over two
kilograms of heroin in paintings they seized in April
and May 1990, all of
which had been posted by the prisoner on the last of the fifteen trips.<p>
	On the second of the fifteen trips the prisoner arrived back in Perth in
January 1987.  Ironically, he was charged with importing
and being in
possession of a prohibited import, being a small quantity of cannabis.
According to what he told West in April 1990,
the prisoner in fact had in his
possession in January 1987 more than one kilogram of heroin, which remained
undetected.<p>
	Counsel for the prisoner conceded that some greater total than sixteen
kilograms had been imported but submitted that I could not
make any finding
beyond reasonable doubt of how much more than sixteen kilograms had been
imported.  Counsel for the Commonwealth
submitted that I could be satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that a total of at least twenty kilograms of heroin had
been imported.
I consider that I should simply find that the total amount of
heroin imported exceeded sixteen kilograms but that I am unable beyond
reasonable doubt to further quantify the amount imported.  The heroin was of a
high degree of purity.<p>
	It is quite clear that the prisoner made very large profits out of his
importations of heroin.  He gold West that for an outlay
of $35,000 he made
$700,000/  He told West that he had made millions of dollars out of importing
heroin.  The police found many valuable
assets at the prisoner's premises
including a large quantity of jewellery, sophisticated cameras and electrical
equipment, expensive
floor coverings and a number of original paintings by
Salvador Dali.  The prisoner had bought sculptures from the actor Anthony
Quinn.
 The prisoner's total taxable income from legitimate sources as
disclosed in his income tax returns fro the seven years up to 1990
was only
$180,000.<p>
	The most salient objective facts of the Commonwealth offence can be briefly
summarised as follows:  Over a period of about four
years the prisoner,
operating by himself and not as a member of any organisation, imported heroin
into Australia on fifteen occasions.
 The gross total amount of heroin imported
exceeded sixteen kilograms and was of a high degree of purity.  The prisoner
devised and
implemented an ingenious scheme for importing the heroin without
being detected.  On all but one occasion he travelled under a false
passport.
He made large profits out of the importations of heroin.<p>
	So far as the State offence is concerned, the prisoner while in custody after
having been arrested for the Commonwealth offence
offered to supply a quantity
of heroin and took some steps for the purpose of arranging the delivery of the
heroin.   No heroin was
in fact delivered.  The quantity of heroin which the
prisoner in fact offered to supply was one pound, that is approximately 450
grams, which exceeds the commercial quantity of 250 grams applicable to heroin.
However, the prisoner was charged with, and pleaded
guilty to, only an offence
under s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and not an offence under
s25(2) of the Act and I must
sentence the prisoner on the basis that the
quantity he supplied was less than the commercial quantity of 250 grams.  I
will proceed
on the basis that the quantity he offered to supply was just under
250 grams.<p>
	The prisoner is about forty years old.  He was married at the age of twenty
and his marriage is still subsisting.  There are two
children of the marriage.
He left school at the end of year 11 and has worked legitimately as a
photographer and as a nurseryman.
 An unusual feature of the case is that the
prisoner was himself addicted to heroin.  He had been using two grams of pure
heroin
a day for eight years up to the time of his arrest.  For the last two
years while he has been in custody the prisoner has been on
a methadone
programme and he intends to remain on the methadone programme until his
addiction is overcome.  According to a report
by Mr Taylor, psychologist, the
prisoner's personality test results do not reveal him to have a very
significant predisposition to
substance dependency and abuse.<p>
	Since being arrested the prisoner has done a number of computer courses in
gaol through a Technical and Further Education college.
 He still has the
support of his family and considers that he could work successfully as a
photographer.  Mr Taylor considers that
he has prospects of rehabilitation.<p>
	The prisoner has a previous criminal history.  Most of the entries are for
minor offences of using or possessing drugs.  However,
in 1976 he was sentenced
in the District Court to a sentence of three years for importing a prohibited
import, cannabis.  In 1978
he was sentenced in the District Court to a sentence
of eight years with a non-parole period of four years on two counts of
supplying
heroin.<p>
	The prisoner pleaded guilty before me to the rolled up Commonwealth charge.
On 20 August 1990 he had pleaded guilty to the individual
Commonwealth charges
but on 5 April 1991 he had withdrawn his pleas of guilty.  In May 1992 the
Commonwealth had suggested that the
prisoner should give consideration to
pleading guilty to a rolled up charge.  When he was committed for trial on 26
May 1992 the
prisoner, while denying his guilt, said that he hoped that in the
future something could be worked out that was fair to both parties.
 The
committal had been a paper committal and no Crown witness had had to give
evidence.  In February 1993 the prisoner's solicitor
indicated that he might
plead guilty to a rolled up charge.<p>
	The prisoner pleaded guilty to the State offence in August 1990 and was
committed for sentence.  Later he withdrew his plea of guilty.
 Subsequently he
again pleaded guilty.  Later still he applied unsuccessfully for leave to
withdraw this second plea of guilty. 
As stated earlier he pleaded guilty
before me to the charge of the State offence.<p>
	A number of matters relevant to sentencing the prisoner were not disputed by
counsel for any of the parties.  These included:  (1)
The Commonwealth offence
was by far the more serious.  (2) It would be appropriate for me to impose a
sentence for the State offence
which was concurrent with part of the sentence
for the Commonwealth offence and to reflect in the sentence for the
Commonwealth offence
the total criminality of the prisoner, including the
criminality in the State offence.  (3) If I imposed a determinate sentence for
the Commonwealth offence it would be appropriate to set a non-parole period at
the usual proportion of three quarters of the head
sentence.  (4) As the
prisoner had been continuously in custody since 11 April 1990 any determinate
sentence for the Commonwealth
offence should commence on that date.  (5) The
sentence for the State offence, having regard to the terms of the charge,
should commence
on 24 April 1990.<p>
	The maximum sentence for the Commonwealth offence is imprisonment for life.
Counsel for the prisoner submitted that I should not
impose a life sentence on
the grounds that: <p>
(1)  	The prisoner was not a member of any criminal organisation.<p>
(2)	There have been cases in which determinate sentences have been imposed
where a much greater quantity of heroin than sixteen kilograms
was imported.<p>
(3)	The prisoner was at the time of committing the offences himself addicted to
heroin and this addiction explained, or partly explained,
why he had initially
become involved in importing heroin.<p>
(4)	The prisoner had pleaded guilty.  The Crown and the community have been
saved the time and expense of a contested committal hearing
and of a trial.<p>
	If I saw fit to impose a determinate sentence, counsel for the prisoner relied
on the same matters as bearing upon the length of
the determinate sentence I
should impose.<p>
	Counsel for the Commonwealth said that he did not oppose the submission that
the present case did not call for the maximum penalty
and said that it would be
proper for me to impose a determinate sentence.  The principal factor which
counsel said had the effect
of saving the case from attracting the maximum
penalty was the plea of guilty.  However, overwhelming the Crown case was, a
trial
of the prisoner would have lasted a considerable time.  Counsel for the
Commonwealth also referred to the prisoner's own addiction
as helping to partly
explain his initial involvement in importing heroin, to the fact that the
prisoner was a sole trader and to
the absence of any corruption of public
officials by the prisoner.<p>
	I have reached the conclusion that I should not impose a life sentence.  Both
counsel for the prisoner and counsel for the Commonwealth
have submitted that I
should not impose a life sentence.  My principal reason for not imposing a life
sentence is that the prisoner
pleaded guilty.  The Crown did not have to call a
witness at either the committal proceedings or in this Court.  A trial of the
prisoner
on the Commonwealth charge would have taken a considerable time,
extending very likely into weeks and quite possibly months.  The
prisoner is
entitled to a discount for his plea of guilty for the utilitarian reasons
referred to in the decision of this Court in
<b>Regina  v  Winchester</b>.<p>
	As to the other reasons advanced for not imposing a maximum sentence, I
consider that I should give some slight weight to the circumstance
that the
prisoner was himself addicted to heroin and that initially at least the
prisoner's motivation may not have been solely financial
gain for himself.
However, clearly the enterprise quickly became one conducted predominantly, if
not solely, for financial gain.<p>
	It may be some slight mitigation of the prisoner's offence that he was not a
member of a criminal organisation. However, where an
offender as a sole trader
imports heroin on the scale on which this offender imported heroin and with a
method of operation as well
planned and executed as this offender's it seems to
me hardly to matter that he was a sole trader and not a member of a criminal
organisation.<p>
	Counsel for the Commonwealth submitted to me that if I impose a determinate
sentence an appropriate head sentence after making the
deduction required by
section 16G of the Crimes Act because of the absence of remissions in this
State, would be between 20 and 25
years giving a non parole period of 13 to 18
years.  Counsel referred to the objective facts of this offence which I have
already
summarised, including that the prisoner was the principal of his own
business, the need for general deterrence in sentencing large
scale drug
importers and the previous criminal convictions of the prisoner for importing
and supplying drugs.<p>
	Counsel for the prisoner submitted that an appropriate sentence before making
the deduction required by section 16G would be 20
to 25 years, giving a head
sentence of 13 to 18 years after the deduction required by section 16G was
made, with a non-parole period
three-quarters of the head sentence.<p>
	Under the Commonwealth Crimes Act I have to impose a sentence of a severity
appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.
  I have taken into
account in addition to other matters, such of the matters in section 16A(2) of
the Commonwealth Crimes Act as
are relevant and known to me.  I have taken into
account the need for general deterrence.  I have already referred to the
prisoner's
plea of guilty and stated that he is entitled to some discount for
utilitarian reasons because of the plea of guilty.  However, there
was some
vacillation by the prisoner in pleading guilty and I do not consider that the
plea indicates any contrition on the part
of the prisoner.  Furthermore the
Crown case against the prisoner can truly be described as overwhelming and so
far as the outcome
of the proceedings against him is concerned the plea of
guilty was merely a recognition of the inevitable result of any trial.<p>
	I am satisfied, as I am required to be satisfied under the Commonwealth Crimes
Act, that no sentence other than imprisonment is
appropriate in all the
circumstances of the case.  Having regard inter alia to the objective facts of
the Commonwealth offence which
I have summarised earlier, the plea of guilty
and the circumstances surrounding the plea of guilty, the subjective
circumstances
of the prisoner, the previous convictions of the prisoner for
importing and supplying drugs, the offence under the Passports Act,
which I
have to take into account, and the offence under State law of supplying a
substantial quantity of heroin, I consider that
I should before the application
of section 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act impose a sentence of 33 years.<p>
	Applying what was said by the Court of  Criminal Appeal in <b>El Karhani</b> I
reduce the sentence, as I am required to do by section 16G of the Commonwealth
Crimes Act, to 22 years in order to allow for the
absence of remissions in this
State.  The non-parole period will be three-quarters of the head sentence, that
is the non-parole period
will be sixteen and a half years.  The sentence will
commence on 11 April 1990.<p>
	Before formally passing sentence I will proceed to the State offence.  For the
State offence of supplying heroin I have decided
that I should sentence the
prisoner to a fixed term of imprisonment of four years commencing on 24 April
1990.  There is no point
in fixing an additional term having regard to the
length of the Commonwealth sentence I am imposing.<p>
	Grahame James Daubney, I sentence you on the charge of being knowingly
concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited
imports to
imprisonment for 22 years commencing from 11 April 1990.  I specify a
non-parole period of sixteen and a half years commencing
from 11 April 1990.<p>
	I am required to explain the sentence on the Commonwealth offence to you.
Service of the sentence will require a period of imprisonment
of no less than
the non-parole period of sixteen and a half years, some of which you have
already served, and if at the end of that
period a parole order is made a
period of service in the community to complete service of the sentence.  If a
parole order is made
the parole order will be subject to conditions.  The
parole order may be amended or revoked.  If you fail to comply with the
conditions
of the parole order and it is revoked, you could be required to
return to prison to serve the balance of the five and a half years.<p>
	On the charge of supplying heroin I sentence you to a fixed term of
imprisonment for four years commencing on 24 April 1990 and
expiring on 23
April 1994.<p>
