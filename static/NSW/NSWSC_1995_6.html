  Orders made
JUDGE1
MASTER MACREADY    This is an application under the De Facto Relationships Act
1984. Both the plaintiff and the defendant
had previously been married and had
children from such former relationships. They had no children from their own
de facto relationship.


2.  The parties met in 1985 when the plaintiff was a console operator at a
Shell Service Station at Pennant Hills. The defendant's
company had an account
for petrol at that service station. They started to go out together in 1986 by
which time they had both separated
from their spouses. At that time the
plaintiff who was 42 years of age had two children, Angela aged 14 and Russell
aged 15 who were
living with her at Baulkham Hills. The defendant, then aged
38, was living at Kalang Road, Kenthurst. He had two children, Paul aged
9
years and Julia aged 8 years. These children lived with the defendant's wife
although the defendant had access. In November 1987
the son Paul moved to
Kenthurst and lived full time with the defendant.


3.  The parties agree that they had a de facto relationship
but are at issue
as to when the relationship commenced. The plaintiff says that the
relationship commenced in July in 1986 while
the defendant says it commenced
in October 1989 when the plaintiff and her children moved in to live full time
at Kenthurst. The
plaintiff and her former husband had by that time sold
Baulkham Hills, settlement taking place in December 1989. Both parties are
agreed that the relationship finished on 8 January 1993 when the plaintiff
left the Kenthurst property. The defendant, who owns the
Kenthurst property,
remained living there. The plaintiff now lives in rented accommodation.
Neither have formed any other permanent
relationship since separation.


4.  Apart from the commencement of the relationship the parties are at issue
on the respective financial
and nonfinancial contributions to the
relationship. I now turn to deal with the question of the commencement of the
de facto relationship.


5.  The question of whether or not the plaintiff and the defendant were living
together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic
basis must be determined
in accordance with the principles recently referred to by the Court of Appeal
in Light v Anderson and Ors
(1992) DFC 95120. They referred with approval to
the decision of Mr Justice Kearney in Simonis v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2021%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 21 NSWLR 677</a> where his Honour in dealing with the similar expression in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a> after reviewing the authorities said at page 685
the following:-
    "I consider that the expression under consideration constitutes
a
    single composite expression of a comprehensive notion or concept
    and therefore has to be approached by considering the
expression
    as a whole and not in several parts.

    This approach, as adopted by Powell J, was also the approach
    preferred
by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Waterford's
    case (see 106). I consider that the factors referred to by Powell
    J,
while not being regarded as a complete test, serve the purpose
    adequately in the present case to determine the question of
 
  eligible person. The factors indicated by Powell J are as follows
    (at 459)):

     "1. The duration of the relationship.
 
    2. The nature and extent of the common residence.
      3. Whether or not a sexual relationship existed.
      4. The degree
of financial interdependence and any arrangements
       for support, between or by the parties.
      5. The ownership, use and
acquisition of property.
      6. The procreation of children.
      7. The care and support of children.
      8. The performance
of household duties.
      9. The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support.
      10. Reputation and 'public' aspects of the
relationship.


    His Honour also referred to the support to be gained for this
    approach from the report of the New South Wales
Law Reform
    Commission concerning de facto relationships (LRC 36 (1983)). His
    Honour quoted the following passage in the report
(at 459):

    17.10. The application of the basic definition to the myriad
    facets of private personal relationships between
men and women
    will inevitably be a matter of degree and proportion. The
    attributes and circumstances of such relationships
differ greatly,
    ranging from what is little more than a casual liaison, to a
    continuing affectionate companionship, to a
long term merging of
    lives and resources. Moreover, the nature and quality of a
    particular relationship may change and develop
over time, making
    it sometimes very difficult to pin-point a time when the
    relationship should assume a new legal significance.

    As I understand it, the parties substantially treated Powell J's
    approach as being appropriate to the circumstances of the
present
    case."


6.  Obviously, the list is not immutable and in particular cases other factors
will have to be considered. The
list is of use and it is convenient to discuss
many of the incidents of the relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased under
the headings set out above.


7.  Before doing so I will first deal with a submission by the defendant that
the plaintiff should
be disbelieved. The substantial basis for the submission
was that the plaintiff failed to disclose in her proceedings in the Family
Court for the dissolution of her marriage that she had a de facto relationship
with the defendant. She filed an application for dissolution
in April 1989 and
in that she showed that the only person living in the house at Baulkham Hills,
apart from herself, was the daughter,
Angela. Russell, of course, by that
stage had started university. She suggested in cross examination that this
relationship had been
disclosed to Mr Barnes, her solicitor. Mr Barnes was
called and he said he had no recollection of that and that there was nothing
in his records to show that there was such a relationship. Such notes as are
in the file indicate that Mr Barnes was only told that
Mr Truelove was in fact
a boyfriend of the plaintiff. I accept Mr Barnes' evidence on this issue in
preference to that of the plaintiff.
Apart from this issue I think the
plaintiff tried to give her evidence truthfully and carefully. I also have
some disquiet about
the plaintiff's evidence on the question of the
commencement of the relationship as I think that she tended to exaggerate.


8. 
I turn to the various headings which I have referred to:- 
1. The duration of the relationship.

  This, of course, is the critical
question. The period up to October 1989 was
a period of some two years and three months. The admitted de facto
relationship continued
for a little over two and a half years thereafter.
2. Nature and extent of the common residence.
  So far as the earlier period at
the Baulkham Hills property is concerned, it
seems quite clear and the parties have agreed that the defendant would spend
three to
four days each week at Baulkham Hills. From November 1987 on his son
would also come quite often and stay there at that time. From
the evidence it
would seem fairly clear that the defendant did not have any wardrobe of
clothes at Baulkham Hills and that he used
to go back, have breakfast and feed
his dog at the Kenthurst property each morning before going to work. In the
period there were
trips by both the plaintiff and the defendant to Kenthurst
or times when they stayed at Kenthurst. This became more frequent later
in
1988 when renovation work was done.
3. Whether or not a sexual relationship existed.
  It is clear that a sexual relationship
existed from early in 1986.
4. The degree of financial interdependence and any arrangements for support,
between or by the parties.
  The plaintiff herself says in the period at Baulkham Hills she used to pay
the expenses for the parties when she stayed there.
The defendant would
reciprocate by paying for meals when they went out for dinner. In contrast,
once the plaintiff moved into Kenthurst
she started sharing the living
expenses with the defendant. An important matter in the financial dealings
between the parties concerns
the plaintiff taking part in the operation of and
investing in the business of the defendant. The defendant had operated a
dental
supply business for many years which he had taken over from his
parents. That was reorganised following his separation from his wife
and in
July 1990 the plaintiff invested $30,000 in that business. In April 1990 she
also invested $20,000 in another company connected
with the business that
bought a property from which the business was carried on. on 20 May 1991 she
was employed in the business
and received wages of $400 per week from that
time until April 1993. These investments in his business and helping him at
work all
occurred after October 1989. Indeed the fact is that the plaintiff
did not have funds until after completion of the sale of her and
her husband's
house in December 1989 to make any such purchases. She did, however, sell her
car probably in January 1989 and after
that time the defendant provided her
with a red Jaguar car for her own personal use.

5. The ownership, use and acquisition of property.
  Prior to October 1989 there was no property which was owned jointly between
them. There were, however, plans for the renovation
of the defendant's
property. The plaintiff had an involvement in 1989 in the preparation of those
plans.
6. The procreation of children.
  There were no children of the relationship.
7. The care and support of children.
  Each party at both the Kenthurst and the Baulkham
Hills property cared for
the children of the other. Initially the defendant's children were not there
as much as the plaintiff's
children who resided with her at Baulkham Hills.
8. The performance of household duties.
  In the period up until October 1989 the
arrangement seemed to be that
perhaps one night a week dinner would be cooked by the plaintiff for the
defendant at her home and
on other nights they would go out to dinner. The
defendant himself attended to looking after his property including engaging a
gardener
and doing washing for himself and his son at home. The plaintiff at
times did washing for the defendant's son at her place but did
not have the
whole of that work.
9. The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support.
  The important aspect under this heading
is the question of the plaintiff
committing herself to a relationship. She says that she did commit herself to
a full time relationship
in July 1986. However, her failure to disclose this
to her solicitor, which in fact I find she did fail to disclose, militates
strongly
against it. The defendant had twice offered to marry the plaintiff at
Baulkham Hills but the plaintiff had rejected those proposals.
10. Reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship.
  Although there were a number of general statements by the parties about
this
aspect little evidence has been called. Cards have been tendered and secondary
evidence given of the way the cards were addressed.
This would not lend
support for the calling of the couple by their surname of "Truelove". This
seems to have only occurred in a serious
way once they moved to Kenthurst.


9.  In considering the matter over all, I think it is important to give weight
to the fact that
the parties maintained separate households and that there was
no substantial commitment by the plaintiff until she decided to move
in with
the defendant once her place had to be sold. In the result I am not satisfied
that a de facto relationship commenced in July
in 1986 and I find that it did
not commence until October 1989.


10.  Recently His Honour Mr Justice Young in Parker v Parker  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1993%2016%20Fam%20LR%20863" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1993 16 Fam LR
863</a> at 870 said the following:-
    "Prior to the recent Court of Appeal decisions in Black v Black,
    supra, and Dwyer v Kaljo, supra,
it was held that the proper
    approach to this sort of case was to apply the four stage approach
    formulated by Powell J in
D v McA  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20Fam%20LR%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 Fam LR 214</a>, 228;
    (1986) DFC 95-030. These four stages were:-

    (i) to identify and value the assets of the parties;

    (ii) to determine
whether any, and if so what contributions of
    type A or type B had been made by each partner;

    (iii) to determine whether
in the circumstances the contributions
    of the applicant had already been sufficiently recognised and
    compensated for;

 
  (iv) to make the appropriate adjustment.

    Although the headnote of Dwyer v Kaljo in NSWLR says that that and
    other cases
have been overruled, both counsel submitted that D v
    McA and cases in the same line such as the decision of Powell J in
    Roy
v Sturgeon  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20NSWLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 NSWLR 454</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11%20Fam%20LR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">11 Fam LR 271</a>; (1986) DFC
    95-031 and my decision in Wilcock v Sain  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20Fam%20LR%20302" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 Fam LR 302</a>;
    (1986) DFC 95-040, should still be followed up to a certain point,
    but after the exercise contemplated in those cases had
been
    performed, it was necessary to stand back and ask oneself whether
    in all the circumstances including the reasonable
expectations of
    the parties and their reliance on the relationship meant that an
    order that only recognised restitutionary
rights or an allowance
    to equalise contributions would not in the circumstances remedy
    the injustices. Counsel differed as
to exactly where the point was
    that one departed from D v McA but it seemed to me that what was
    put was an appropriate way
of dealing with the present problem."


11.  At the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff was in the process
of selling
her house with her former husband. She received in December 1989
$82,804.24 being her half share of the balance of purchase price.
She also I
infer received $6,972.50 being a one half share of the balance of the deposit
paid. She also had her furniture and a Toyota
Corona car. That car was sold
shortly after the commencement of the relationship by the plaintiff. She said
in her evidence in chief
that she thought it was sold for about $14,000. The
defendant, who actually handled the sale, said that it was sold for $11,500
and,
given the concessions made by the plaintiff in cross examination, I
accept that in fact the car was sold for that amount. She also
had some small
savings.


12.  The defendant had by the date of commencement of the relationship bought
out his former wife's interest
in the Kenthurst property. The value of the
property prior to the renovations which commenced in late 1988 was $430,000.
He also
at that stage had his interest in a partnership which he was
conducting with his parents. The evidence does not address the value
of that
interest. This was the partnership that carried on the dental supply business
which was the main occupation of the defendant.
At this time he owed his
parents $60,000 which he had borrowed from them to buy out his wife's half
share in the Kenthurst property.


13.  In late 1988 the defendant commenced renovations to the Kenthurst
property which he had planned many years before. Over the
period 1988 to 1990
the defendant spent $46,952.87 on the renovations. Between October 1991 and
1993 he spent $154,774.23 on further
renovations. The funds for this
expenditure were provided in part by his parents. on the sale of their house
in May 1991 his parents
gave him $100,000. They also made similar gifts to the
defendant's sisters. The $100,000 was applied towards the renovations. There
were also other funds lent to the defendant during the course of the
relationship namely:-
     6 April 1992 $11,650
    26 June
1992 $50,000
    18 September 1992 $10,000
    30 October 1992 $38,350
    Total $110,000


14.  The defendant's mother gave evidence
and it seems clear that she regarded
this as simply a loan to her son. Parts of the loan may have been taken up in
other entities
books over the ensuing years but I will come back to this
matter later.


15.  The renovations on the property are not complete and
there has been a
substantial over capitalisation of the property. The value of the property as
at 30 January 1995 is agreed in the
sum of $482,500.


16.  There is no doubt that the plaintiff assisted in the renovations with
painting and wall papering in the premises.
She also made financial
contributions to the renovation. I have mentioned that the plaintiff sold her
car after the relationship
commenced and it is accepted by the defendant that
the $11,500 purchase price was used for renovations for the home, principally
the kitchen and laundry. In addition there were amounts of $2,153.70 for
kitchen appliances, $2,185 for carpet which were contributed
to the
renovations. The defendant admits that $2,200 was paid towards the cost of a
table and six chairs and a wall unit. The defendant
says that he paid $400 in
respect of those purchases and I accept that he did make that payment. The
plaintiff also paid $500 towards
the plans for the renovations. The total
contribution by the plaintiff to the renovations was $18,538.70.


17.  In mid 1990 the
business carried on in partnership by the defendant and
his parents was transferred to a company, Durodent Dental Supplies Pty Ltd
(herein called "Durodent"). The plaintiff paid the defendant $30,000 in order
to acquire two of the ten issued shares in that company.
No doubt those funds
were then injected by the defendant into the company and the company's
accounts at the end of this first year
show a goodwill figure of $150,000 in
the accounts which reflects the valuation of the 20 percent shareholding sold
to the plaintiff
by the defendant. The plaintiff started to work for that
company in May 1991 and she received an effective wage of $400 per week
net in
respect of that work. Her work was varied and included a number of different
tasks of an office nature and a delivery nature.
She also attended to some of
the accounting functions and was employed on an average of four and a half
days a week.


18.  In April
1990 a company Ostabody Pty Ltd (herein called "Ostabody")
purchased a unit at Victoria Avenue, Castle Hill for a purchase price
of
$237,500. The purpose of the acquisition was to allow, inter alia, Durodent to
conduct its business from those premises. In order
to effect the purchase sums
were contributed by the plaintiff and the defendant and the McNamaras who were
persons associated in
some way with the business that was carried on by
Durodent. The purchase by the company was merely as trustee or nominee as the
records
apparently indicate that the real estate was held by it as to a one
half share for the McNamaras, a quarter share for the plaintiff
and a quarter
share for the defendant. The plaintiff applied $20,000 from the proceeds of
the sale of her property towards the acquisition
of her interest in this
property. The defendant contributed $20,000 and $80,000 was borrowed from
Westpac Finance to make up the
balance required for the parties' purchase of
their two quarter shares. Thereafter rental of approximately $9,000 per annum
was charged
by the parties as landlords to Durodent in respect of Durodent's
occupation of part of the unit. The plaintiff also contributed $3,000
to the
furnishing of the unit.


19.  During later years the Westpac loan was refinanced from borrowings from
the defendant's parents
and interest was paid of an amount approximately equal
to the rent received by them. The defendant says, and this is not disputed,
that the rental payable was the appropriate market rental. The business of
Durodent did not proceed well during the years up until
the determination of
the parties' relationship. This was through no fault of the parties but was a
result of the company losing one
of its franchises which had been its major
source of income. The supplier decided to enter the market place directly
rather than
employ agents in Australia for their products.


20.  The movements in the parents' loans and their allocation to different
projects
by the parties are somewhat difficult to follow and the documentary
evidence is quite understandably incomplete given the family
nature of these
loans. There was originally a mortgage for $60,000 which was secured on the
Kenthurst property. However this was
discharged to allow borrowings from
Westpac to finance the initial acquisition of the Ostabody interest. There
does not seem however
to be any doubt that the total amount advanced by the
defendant's parents was $170,000 and that interest was paid to them during
the
period of the loan. There seems to have been an allocation of $80,000 of this
amount to the parties' Ostabody interest with the
parents receiving interest
calculated by reference to that amount. The interest was similar to the rental
income charged by the parties
to Durodent. The balance of the loan of $90,000
was taken up in the books of Durodent and one sees, for instance, in the
accounts
for the period 31 March 1994 that it was shown as an unsecured
non-current loan of $90,000. At the same time those accounts showed
a loan
from directors of $121,267. It was agreed between the parties that this loan
was in fact the defendant's loan with the company.
By the time of these
accounts and indeed for the years before there was a deficiency in the
shareholders equity in this company because
of the difficulties with its
operations. It was of course necessary to value the defendant's interest and I
will come to this in
a moment.


21.  I will now note what the plaintiff's position was at the end of the
relationship. The plaintiff had her interest
in the property owned by Ostabody
which was a one quarter interest in that property. She also had a 20%
shareholding in Durodent.
Her bank account at termination of the relationship
was in credit in the sum of $57,940.87. Since the termination of the
relationship
she spent some $34,000 of this on a car which is now worth
$27,000. If one compares the assets of the plaintiff at the commencement
of
the relationship, namely, the car worth $11,500, the proceeds of her sale of
$89,776.74 and monies in her saving account of $1,099
and deducts from that
her contributions in a financial sense during the relationship one finds that
she would have left over some
$35,000. However, it is clear that she has been
able to save some funds during the period which funds could only have come
from her
employment with the company.


22.  The defendant's position at the time of termination of the relationship
was that he was the sole
owner of the property at Kenthurst, he owned 80% of
Durodent, he had a loan account of approximately $120,000 with that company
and
he had his quarter interest in the property owned by ostabody. To be
deducted from that in one form or another is the $170,000 owed
to his parents.
He also had some other items such as a boat worth $8,000, a 1935 Chevrolet
worth $1,000 and furniture which he valued
at $2,500.


23.  There were a number of contributions by the defendant to the welfare of
the plaintiff and also her son which need
to be taken into account. The
plaintiff and the defendant were both provided with cars and mobile phones by
virtue of their interest
in Durodent. The defendant assisted the plaintiff's
son and daughter by providing cars, work or assistance to them with repairs to
cars.


24.  In summary the financial contributions made by the parties were as
follows:- 
    The plaintiff:

    Contributions
to renovations 11,506.00
    Contributions to furniture 7,038.76
    Contributions to Ostabody 23,000.00
    Contributions to Durodent
30,000.00
    Total $71,538.76

    The defendant:

    Contributions to renovations 201,727.10
    Contributions to Ostabody 20,000.00
    Contributions to Durodent 120,000.00
    Total $341,727.10


25.  The defendant of course provided with the Kenthurst property
the
accommodation for the parties.


26.  So far as the provision of household expenses are concerned the household
food seems to
have been provided by the plaintiff. The amounts are not
quantified in the evidence.


27.  It is necessary to look at what are the
nonfinancial contributions by the
parties. There is conflicting evidence by the two parties in respect of this
aspect. It is fairly
clear that the enmity between the parties has led to the
not uncommon situation of one party slightly exaggerating their claim and
the
other party denigrating the claims made. I am satisfied that the plaintiff
made a substantial contribution as a homemaker and
she seems to have done a
lot of work about the house and spent a lot of time working in the garden in
the property.


28.  So far
as parenting contributions are concerned there were of course more
to do in this respect in respect of the plaintiff's children as
there are two
of them for some of the time. There was some dispute between the parties about
how the plaintiff treated or reacted
to the defendant's son but I am satisfied
that she did play a role in his parenting. I am mindful that there needs to be
given due
weight to these contributions but it should also be remembered that
in this case the parties did not have children of their own.
This is not a
case of one spouse staying at home minding children to enable the other to go
out and work. Both parties were working
and their children were somewhat older
at the time they commenced their relationship, namely, 12 to 18 years.


29.  It is of course
necessary to value the parties' property at the date of
hearing to come to an appropriate adjustment of the parties' interests. The
parties are agreed that the property owned by Ostabody has a present value of
$223,000. A one half share of that is $111,500 and
after the parties
allocation of $80,000 of the parents' loan to that property the equity of the
two parties in the property is $32,500.
Thus each party has an interest of
$15,750 in this property.


30.  In respect of Durodent the parties' accountants conferred for
some time
during the hearing and eventually arrived at an agreed statement in respect of
a number of matters concerning that company.
The first of these is that the
value of the shares in the company is nil. This means that the only matters
for concern are the relevant
loan accounts. As I have mentioned in the most
recent balance sheet the parents' loan account was in the sum of $90,000 and
the defendant's
loan account was in the sum of $121,267. There is a deficiency
in the funds available in the company and the accountants are agreed
that
assuming the parents were paid their $90,000 in full that the amount recovered
by the defendant in respect of his loan account
would be $53,264. If priority
was not given to the parents' loan then he would recover $83,632.


31.  I have already adverted to
the present agreed value of the Kenthurst
property at $482,500. There are a number of minor disputes between the parties
regarding
furniture and I will now briefly return to these so that they can be
taken into account in the final determination.


32.  There
was a table and six chairs and a wall unit in respect of which I
accept the plaintiff paid $2,200 and the defendant $400. I will
make
appropriate adjustments for this on the basis that the plaintiff will be able
to retain them, the defendant having no objection
to her doing so. There is a
wall hanging which the defendant says the plaintiff may have without
adjustment. There are two small
mats which belong to the plaintiff which the
defendant concedes she may take without adjustment. There are some fire tools
which
were a gift to the parties and the defendant agrees that the plaintiff
may have these without adjustment. There is a trailer on the
defendant's
premises and if the plaintiff believes she is entitled to ownership of it then
the defendant says she may take it without
adjustment. There are some Apollo
blinds which were to be erected but have not and according to the defendant
the plaintiff may have
these without adjustment.


33.  I turn to a consideration of the factors relating to the appropriate
adjustment. Primarily the parties
have approached this matter on the basis
that the parties' financial affairs should be completely separated. This in
practical terms
means that the defendant should pay out the plaintiff for her
interests in Ostabody and Durodent and indemnify her in respect of
any
liability in respect of loans to the defendant's parents.


34.  The plaintiff seeks in this action payment upon the above basis
to her of
$150,000. To justify this the plaintiff in submissions pointed to her
financial contribution of some $70,000, the great
disparity between her
financial position and the position of the defendant and refers to the
non-financial contributions which she
has made.


35.  Various matters have to be placed into context. So far as the renovations
to the property are concerned it should
be appreciated that although the
plaintiff may have paid $18,538.76 the defendant himself contributed
$201,727.10. Both parties have
put money into the property which has not
produced a corresponding increase in value. The increase in value over the
period of the
relationship was only $52,500 and, accordingly, I think any
adjustment has to take into account the fact that both parties, for good
reasons at the time, made contributions which have not produced a
corresponding increase in value of the property which is to be
considered in
the adjustment process. In respect of the property in the name of Ostabody in
which they each have a quarter interest
that interest has fallen in value. It
was an investment which they jointly made and although both have put more into
the property
the adjustment should only reflect their present interest in the
property.


36.  So far as the business in concerned the loss of
the value of that
business is not a matter of fault on the part of either party. Although the
plaintiff may have lost her $30,000
it can be seen on the figures that the
defendant has also lost his corresponding interest in what was thought to be
the initial goodwill.
Over and above this he will lose, on the basis that his
parents are paid out their $90,000, a sum of $65,000 worth of his loan funds.


37.  I think that it is appropriate that one approaches this matter on the
basis that the parents do not take a loss on their $90,000
investment. There
is good reason to believe, particularly bearing in the mind the evidence of
Mrs Truelove senior that the loan was
a personal loan to the defendant that
its incorporation into the business may well have been simply a matter of the
defendant's own
convenience. In these circumstances he is liable for the
repayment.


38.  It was suggested that in accordance with the principles
in Norbis v
Norbis <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=161%20CLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">161 CLR 513</a> at 523 I should take a global approach to the matter by
looking at the pool of assets now available for distribution between the
parties and fix a proportion having taken into account the relevant matters.
Certainly that can be done and the total pool of assets
would appear to be as
follows:-
      Kenthurst property                          482,500
      Ostabody                        
            32,500
      Defendant's loan account with Durodent       53,264
      Plaintiff's car                              27,000
      Defendant's chattels                         11,500
                                                  606,764
      Less due
to deft's parents                   80,000
                                                 $526,764


39.  An asset by asset approach
could involve a comparison of the relative
positions of the parties at the time of commencement of the relationship, the
extent of
the contributions to each asset and each parties' position at the
end of the relationship. This produces the following result.


40.  The plaintiff's assets at the commencement of the relationship were worth
$101,276.74. At the end of the relationship she had
savings of $57,940.87 and
an interest in Ostabody which is now worth $15,750. This totals $73,690.87.


41.  The defendant's assets
at the commencement of the relationship were worth
$380,000 plus the partnership business. At the end of the relationship he had
assets which have a present net worth of $483,014.


42.  To get to this position the plaintiff spent $71,538.761 of her assets.
Part went to over capitalise the defendant's house and the balance went to
unsuccessful joint endeavours. The defendant received
a gift of $100,000 and
then applied this and another $141,727 to over capitalise his house and
contribute to unsuccessful joint endeavours.


43.  Thus the plaintiff's assets have decreased by 27% and the defendants have
increased by 27%. Such a comparison is of no great
assistance given the input
by the defendant's parents.


44.  I do not think it appropriate to simply look at a global pool of assets
and make some adjustment based upon contributions or movement in the parties'
relative position. Rather I think it appropriate to
consider that in respect
of certain discreet areas the parties have jointly made unsuccessful
investments the losses on which should
be shared by them equally. The
plaintiff should be given some credit for additions to the defendant's house
but the amount of this
should take into account that there has been some over
capitalisation of the house. Then the remaining financial and non financial
contributions should be considered to come to a judgment on any adjustment.
The shortness of the relationship and the disparity in
the parties' assets at
the commencement of the relationship mitigates against a global approach.


45.  Having considered all of
the evidence in the matter some of which I have
referred to in this judgment it is my view that the appropriate adjustment to
be
made on the basis I have outlined earlier, namely, a separation of the
parties' financial interests, and an indemnity of the plaintiff
in respect of
any loan to the defendant's parents would call for there to be a payment by
the defendant to the plaintiff of $50,000.
The parties may bring in short
minutes and make submissions on costs.
