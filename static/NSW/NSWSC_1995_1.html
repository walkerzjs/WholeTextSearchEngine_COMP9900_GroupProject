<u>JOHN FRANCIS GEORGE AS EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF THE LATE HABSIE GEORGE  v
PAUL GEORGE P/L &amp; 2 ORS</u><p>
002575/93<p>
THURSDAY 11 MAY 1995<p>
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION<p>
SANTOW J<p>
<p>
Mr A S Martin for the plaintiff.<p>
Mr Ellison with Ms Cruse for the first and second defendants.<p>
<p>
	------<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  The third defendant has been served with the summons.  My instructing
solicitor is obtaining information as to when that
happened.<p>
<p>
ELLISON:  My solicitors did in fact appear for the third defendant.  He has
filed an affidavit which indicates he is seeking no orders
and although my
solicitor should have filed a notice of ceasing to act, the third defendant
does not seek any relief and I do not
appear today for the third defendant, but
there is no doubt he has been served.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  The question is does the third defendant oppose any of the relevant
orders claimed by the plaintiff in the summons.  There
are no cross-claims in
this matter.<p>
<p>
ELLISON:  He takes a neutral ground.  He neither supports nor opposes.  He
seeks no order.  He does not ask that any particular order
be made.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  The plaintiff is the executor of the estate of the late Habsie George
who was the plaintiff's mother.  The late Habsie George
died on 19 October
1992.  On 19 April 1993 probate was granted by this Court to her last will
dated <p>
3 February 1989.  Your Honour should have received a chronology from the
plaintiff this morning.  <p>
<p>
(Mr Ellison handed up a copy of his chronology.)<p>
<p>
	The plaintiff is the last son of the late Habsie George.  The second defendant
is the eldest son of the late Habsie George - there
were five sons in the
family and one daughter.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  And the second defendant?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  The second defendant is the eldest son of the late Habsie George.  He
is and was the managing director and principal shareholder
and controller of
the company of the first defendant, Paul George Pty Limited.  The third
defendant, Peter Wayne George, is the son
of the second defendant, Paul George,
and he is also a director of the first defendant company, Paul George Pty
Limited, which raises
the oddity where we have one director opposing the orders
being sought in the summons, being Paul George, and the third defendant,
the
other director, Peter Wayne, not opposing them.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Not opposing and not supporting?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Not supporting.  If I could give your Honour an overview of these
proceedings.  They are brought by way of a summons filed
on 14 May 1993 by the
plaintiff.  In substance it seeks a declaration that a deed dated 14 September
1987, to which I will refer
in my address as the 1987 deed, between the late
Habsie George and the first defendant, Paul George Pty Limited, is null and
void.<p>
<p>
	That deed, in substance, transferred from Habsie George to the first
defendant, Paul George Pty Limited, a block of land known as
Lot 12 in a
proposed sub-division at the time which ultimately became registered and the
sub-division is contained in DP772126, but
the sub-division is along the Scenic
Highway, Terrigal on the Central Coast of New South Wales.<p>
<p>
	The summons also seeks a declaration that an earlier deed dated 7 March 1984,
which I will refer to as the 1984 deed, between Habsie
George and the first
defendant amongst other parties, is valid and enforceable.  That deed, the 1984
deed, sought in effect to provide
for a number of things, but principally that
a block of land, which I will refer to as the old Lot 12 in a different DP
number, DP600554,
be sub-divided into six lots, being Lots 12 through to 17,
Lot 12 constituting what is referred to earlier on as new Lot 12.<p>
<p>
	The 1984 deed also provided that within one month after registration of the
new plan of sub-division, the first defendant, Paul
George Pty Limited, would
issue certificates of title in respect of the new Lot 12 to Habsie George or
her nominee.  I will take
your Honour later on to the terms of the deed
itself.<p>
<p>
	The summons seeks an order that the obligations of the first defendant to
transfer the new Lot 12 be specifically performed.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Those obligations being under -- ?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  The 1984 deed.  I have mentioned Habsie George had six children.  The
eldest was Susan, who ultimately became Susan Hall;
 her date of birth was 21
January 1921.  She is now deceased and she has sworn an affidavit in these
proceedings dated 28 October
1993.  The eldest son, as I mentioned, is Paul;
his date of birth was 23 February 1923.  The next eldest is a son called
Anthony,
the next is Louis, the next is Edmund Peter and the last is John, the
plaintiff in these proceedings.<p>
<p>
	On 15 September 1960 the father of the children and husband of Habsie George
died, and that is where ultimately the root of this
litigation springs from.
Under the will of the husband of Habsie George, Habsie George received
virtually nothing.  Some time in
spring 1963 an action was brought by Habsie
George under the Testator Family Maintenance Act against the husband's estate.
That action
was subsequently settled and, pursuant to the settlement, Habsie
George had transferred to her two blocks of land, Lots 11 and 12
of DP600554,
that Lot 12 being referred to as the old Lot 12.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  And which presumably is larger than the new Lot 12?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes your Honour.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  But which contains it.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, exactly.  Then in August 1978 a contract for sale was entered
into between Habsie George and Paul George Pty Limited,
the first defendant,
pursuant to which Habsie George transferred to Paul George the old Lot 12.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  For consideration?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  The consideration was $40,000 but there was a forgiveness of the
consideration or a major part of the consideration by Paul
George Pty Limited,
and ultimately in 1981 --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  So that contract was between Habsie George and Paul George Pty
Limited, was it?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes your Honour.  In 1981 Habsie George then commenced proceedings
seeking to set aside the contract and transfer and for
the old Lot 12 to be
transferred back to her.  Those proceedings are numbered 2780 of 1981 and were
commenced against Paul George
himself and his company, Paul George Pty
Limited.<p>
<p>
	The basis of the claim that was made was that Habsie George, at the time of
the contract, did not know or appreciate what she was
doing.  The evidence that
was led from Habsie George in those proceedings, which we will be seeking to
tender in these proceedings,
indicated that she could neither read nor write
English.  Her native language was Arabic but she was entirely illiterate. <p>
<p>
	Secondly, that she was unable to speak or comprehend English, except in
possibly its simplest form using one or, at the most, two
words.  Thirdly, she
had never been educated.  Fourthly, that she was commercially inexperienced,
that she did not go shopping herself,
that she relied upon her husband or her
sons or daughter to do so for her.  Nextly, that she didn't know what she was
doing at the
time, the contract had never been read out to her.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Or translated?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Nor had it been translated to her.  She never had the benefit of any
independent advice concerning the transaction at all
and it was alleged that
Paul George and his company had misused their position of influence over her to
secure a benefit, being the
transfer of the land without any adequate
consideration.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  That is the land being old Lot 12 - transferred without
consideration.  Do you mean by that taking into account the
forgiveness that
later occurred?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes your Honour.  The next relevant matter is that those proceedings
were settled, that is proceedings numbered 2780 of
1981 in the Equity Division
of the Supreme Court, by way of the deed I have referred to earlier as the 1987
deed which was executed
on 7 March 1984 - this is the 1984 deed.<p>
<p>
	Your Honour will see the parties are Habsie George, Paul George, Paul George
Pty Limited, Peter Wayne George, the third defendant
in these proceedings, and
John Francis George, the plaintiff.<p>
<p>
	The first relevant matter is (a)(iii) which indicates that (reads) - that
being the old Lot 12.  Then sub-paragraph (5) on the first
page of the deed
(reads).<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Those are the allegations of course.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.  Then if you go to the operative part of the deed contained at
page 2 item (b) it refers firstly to (reads) - indicating
the proposed plan of
sub-division.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  A new plan, was it?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  No, your Honour.  Ultimately that was a plan that was registered.
Then at the top of page 3, (b)(ii) (reads).  The next
sub-clause which is of
central importance in this case is (3) (reads).  Sub-paragraph (4) says
(reads).  Sub-paragraph (5) relates
to an obligation to pay interest (reads).
On page 4, sub-paragraph (6) says (reads).<p>
<p>
	Then there are further obligations in the deed, which I won't at this stage
take your Honour to.  Your Honour will note that annexed
to the deed is a copy
of the proposed plan of sub-division which your Honour will see is from the
registered surveyors, Bannister
and Hunter, and there is a description of the
land.  Simply put, the old Lot 12 incorporates the new Lots 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
and
17, your Honour sees in that plan.<p>
<p>
	What happened next is that Habsie George lodged a caveat on 7 June 1984 over
the whole of the old Lot 12, to protect her interests
pursuant to the deed.
Then the next relevant matter that took place was in 1985.  Habsie George
suffered from pneumonia, following
which her condition deteriorated
significantly.  At that stage in 1985, according to her treating doctor, Dr
Margaret Henderson,
who has sworn an affidavit in these proceedings, she
developed short term memory loss and suffered from short periods of confusion.
At that stage her hearing and sight were impaired and from that point onwards
she became increasingly more deaf and considerably
more blind.  As at 1985 she
was aged 87 years.<p>
<p>
	At that stage she was unable to look after herself, she was unable to care for
herself, she was unable to cook, unable to bathe
herself, unable to do any
housework herself, and from that date onwards, 1985, it was necessary for her
to have care on a daily basis,
and that care was initially provided by her
daughter, Susan Hall, and her son Anthony from the period 1986 through to
1987.<p>
<p>
	During 1986 there are purported nominations by her in respect of persons who
are nominated to have the new Lot 12 transferred to
them at her direction.
These nominations were ineffective on a number of grounds which I will come to
later, but at this stage all
your Honour needs to know is that there were
purported nominations during that period, purportedly on her behalf.<p>
<p>
	Prior to the first nomination she indicated the first nominee, being Anthony
George, would be holding any property transferred to
him on trust for her.  So
if the nominations were effective it would be on the basis that the nominee
would be holding the property
on trust for Habsie George - I will come back to
that.  The nominations did change ultimately.  The first nomination was to
Anthony
George in respect of both properties and the last nomination was to
Anthony George, so if the nomination is effective to Anthony
George he was to
hold it on trust for Habsie George.<p>
<p>
	But in 1987 the plaintiff, John George, commenced caring for Habsie George on
a daily basis.  As I mentioned, before then Anthony
George or Susan Hall was
doing so.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  This is now instead of those two carers?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, in 1987 there was a change.  The reason for that is that Susan
Hall's health was deteriorating and Anthony George had
remarried.<p>
<p>
	The next relevant event that took place was during this period from the time
when the 1984 deed was first executed up to the middle
of 1987, there was
correspondence on behalf of Habsie George, through her solicitors, seeking to
have the plan of sub-division registered
with a view to having the certificates
of title in respect of the new Lots 12 and 15 transferred to her.  The other
side, Paul George
and Paul George Pty Limited, appeared not to be progressing
the matter.<p>
<p>
	There will be an allegation that the plan of sub-division needed to obtain the
consent - or the consent of the plaintiff needed
to be obtained in order for
the plan of sub-division to be actually registered.  But on closer analysis the
real reason was simply
the defendants seeking an excuse to explain their
dilatory behaviour and their failure to perform their obligations under the
1984
deed to effect registration of the plan of sub-division so that the
certificates of title could issue to Habsie George.<p>
<p>
	As will be seen in the correspondence, the position of Paul George and Paul
George Pty Limited - they were not entirely happy about
the outcome of the
settlement in proceedings number 2780 resulting in the 1984 deed and were
resisting transferring the land back
to Habsie George.<p>
<p>
(Access to both parties granted to the file in proceedings number 2780 of 1981
and to the documents produced in court from the Gosford
City Council.)<p>
<p>
SHORT ADJOURNMENT.<p>
<p>
ON RESUMPTION<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  We got up to 1987.  In that year, Paul George approached John George,
the plaintiff, and indicated that he wished to carry
out his obligations -<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  He, Paul George?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  That he, Paul George, or more precisely Paul George Pty Ltd., wished
to carry out its obligations under the 1984 Deed and
to transfer new Lots 12
and 15 into the names of John George and Susan Hall on trust for Habsie George,
but nothing happened; and
then it was necessary, on 7 August, as I think I have
indicated, 1987 for a letter from the solicitors of Habsie George to be written
to the solicitors for Paul George and Paul George Pty Ltd stating that in
effect -<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Sorry, to the solicitors for those two or to them?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, the solicitors for Paul George and Paul George Pty Ltd.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Same solicitors?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, stating, in effect, your Honour, that enough was enough; nothing
had been done in relation to their obligations concerning
the 1984 deed and
that Habsie George would be taking over the steps to effect the sub-division
pursuant to her entitlement under
the 1984 deed, in particular sub-cl B6 of
that deed.  <p>
<p>
Then prior to 14 September 1987, just immediately prior to  14 September 1987,
the plaintiff was contacted by Paul George and requested
to arrange for Habsie
George to come to the offices of Bingham Finlay Turnell, solicitors at Woy Woy,
who were the solicitors for
Paul George. <p>
<p>
John George, the plaintiff, understood that the purpose of the meeting of 14
September 1987 was to attend the offices of those solicitors
for the purpose of
Paul George and Paul George Pty Ltd performing their obligations under the 1984
deed and effecting the transfers
of the Lots 12 and 15, either to Habsie George
directly or on her behalf, on trust for her, and inferentially that was the
understanding
that Habsie George, if she was capable of understanding at that
stage, had for attending the meeting of 14 September 1987. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  And she did?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes she did.  I must add this: prior to 14 September, Paul George had
instructed Mr Turnell to draft a deed to vary the
1984 deed and also to draft
the will on behalf of Habsie George.   Habsie George never saw any of these
documents prior to 14 September
1987.   <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Steps were also taken for an interpreter to be present, a Mr Joseph
Baynie.  The people who were present at this meeting
on 14 September 1987 were
the plaintiff, John George, Habsie George, Paul George, Peter George and Joe
Baynie and the solicitor,
Mr Turnell, and there are issues that exist between
the parties as to exactly what transpired in that meeting.   <p>
<p>
It is the plaintiff's case that at no stage --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Did Joseph Baynie give any affidavit evidence?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Mr Baynie has sworn an affidavit, your Honour.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, go on.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  It is clear, even on Mr Baynie's own sworn evidence, that he did not
translate or interpret the totality or full effect
of any document which
ultimately was signed or on which Habsie George made her mark.  That is on his
own sworn evidence.<p>
<p>
At the time of this meeting on 14 September, I remind your Honour that at that
stage Habsie George was aged 89.   Her health had
deteriorated even from her
position as at 1985.  She had, according to Dr Henderson, her treating doctor,
become increasingly more
deaf and increasingly more blind.  She still continued
to develop short-term memory loss and short periods of confusion.  She was
illiterate, unable to speak or comprehend English except in its most basic form
by use of one or two words.  She was at that stage
unable to look after
herself, unable to cook, unable to bathe herself or to do any housework.   She
was commercially inexperienced.
 She did not do any shopping herself.  That was
done for her.  She had very little contact with the outside world at that stage
and
she certainly had not seen any documents that she was asked to sign on 14
September prior to that date, nor had any been supplied
to her or the plaintiff
prior to that date, and she certainly had not received any independent advice
at any stage prior to that
date. <p>
<p>
At the meeting itself Mr Turnell indicated, in relation to the deed, that the
document --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  To the 1980 - <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  - the 1987 deed, that is the one that was ultimately executed on 14
September 1987. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes. <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  That the 1987 deed, in effect she would be releasing the caveat that
she had over the property and in return Paul would
be giving to her two blocks
of land to be held on trust for her by John George, the plaintiff, and Susan
Hall.   No opportunity was
given at the meeting for her to read the document.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  What do you mean, read it in translation or - ?<p>
<p>
MARTIN: That is, for anyone to read the document or to be translated.  As I
say, on Mr Baynie's own evidence, he acknowledges that
he did not embark upon
any full translation and ultimately he merely witnessed the documents. <p>
<p>
Your Honour, at that time, on the treating doctor's own evidence, Dr Margaret
Henderson - and she had seen her regularly - she was
of the opinion that Habsie
George probably would not have been able to understand the effect of a legal
document even if it were
explained to her in her own dialect.  <p>
<p>
The deed itself that was executed, if I could take your Honour to that
document, on that date --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I have got that.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Your Honour will see the parties are simply Habsie George and Paul
George.   It recites the earlier proceedings, 4280. 
 <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Does it purport to amend the earlier deed?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  In essence it does, your Honour.   <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Does purport to amend it?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  It does not purport to do so expressly but the effect of the deed is
to amend the earlier deed because the first point that
jumps out, your Honour,
is that all of the parties to the earlier deed, the 1984 deed, are not parties
to this document.   <p>
<p>
I will not take your Honour to the recitals; and then the operative clause of
the deed: "1. Habsie hereby rescinds any ... as follows."
   Then there is
provision in relation to Lot 15.  That is not the subject of these proceedings.
<p>
<p>
Then the relevant clause is 2, sub-par (2), "In respect of the balance of the
proposed division of the land, namely Lots 12" - that
being new lot 12 - "Paul
George Pty Ltd shall be sole and unencumbered registered proprietor of same,"
and sub-par (3), "Prior to
the lodgment of the plan of sub-division, Habsie
agrees to hand to ... form."   <p>
<p>
Then Clause 3, Habsie appoints Paul George Pty Ltd and John Francis George as
her trustees empowers them to collect from Anthony
George moneys previously
held by Anthony for Habsie and to take legal action to recover such moneys.
<p>
<p>
Then your Honour will note the form of execution on the deed.   <p>
<p>
There was a discussion at the meeting as to whether, in fact, it was necessary
for her to sign. Habsie George had indicated that
all she could do was make her
mark and that is what she proceeded to do.  <p>
<p>
Also on that day, 14 September 1987, there was a will signed by Habsie George,
prepared on the instructions of Paul George, leaving
the state to John George
with Paul George as executor.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Then the meeting concluded.<p>
<p>
On 13 November 1987 there was a withdrawal of caveat in relation to the earlier
caveat over the two lots and then ultimately, on
20 January 1988, there was
registration of the plan of sub-division, DP772126, relating to the new Lot 12
but relating to the whole
of the old Lot 12. <p>
<p>
Then on 21 March 1988 there was a letter from Mr Turnell to Paul George
advising him that the deed dated 14 September, the 1987 deed,
may in effect be
invalid because of a conflict of interest. <p>
<p>
Then on 3 February 1989, Habsie George revoked her earlier will which had been
executed on 14 September 1987 and a new will - I do
not know whether your
Honour has it.  It is to be found as Annexure A to the affidavit of John
Francis George of 13 July 1993.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I have that. <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  If your Honour could go to it, there your Honour will see that she
appoints the plaintiff as her executor and trustee and
this is the will where
ultimately probate was granted.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  You say this is the probated will?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.  Then she indicates how her estate will be left and in her last
declaration in the will she states, "My estate is to
include Lots 12 and 15 ...
on my behalf," indicating that at that stage, that is 3 February 1989, she
understood that Lots 12 and
15 were being held for her by Paul George Pty Ltd
as trustee.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Presumably, if your earlier contention is correct, this will would
also fail?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Not necessarily.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Unless she had a sudden flash of improvement.   <p>
MARTIN:  Not necessarily, no.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  I thought the essence of what you put earlier was that the
treating doctor considered that even if it had been translated
as a will, she
would not have understood it. <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  That is so as at 1987. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  So you are saying she improved?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Your Honour, needless to say, needless to say, this is the will which
probate has been granted to.  There has been no challenge
to the will. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  I am saying, as a matter of logic - <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  As a matter of logic.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  - she either has had a distinct improvement in the two years that
intervened or your first proposition does not stand.
  <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  As a matter of logic, your Honour is correct but as a matter of what
has happened factually, it does not necessarily follow.<p>
<p>
In any event, your Honour, that is not a matter that need concern you.
Probate has been granted and that is the position we find
ourselves in today.
<p>
<p>
Then, your Honour, on 7 December 1989, she instructed her own solicitors to
write to Paul George and Paul George Pty Ltd --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Just one other query - <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  - is that the mark in this case seems to be a little more distinct
than the mark in the previous one.  Maybe nothing
hangs on that.  The previous
one is just a cross - this one seems to be something that looks like a
hieroglyphic but I am sure nothing
hangs on that. <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Your Honour, the next relevant date is 7 December 1989.   <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  On which you are saying Habsie George instructed her own
solicitors?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Who drew the will that was probated?  Is that her own solicitor
too?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Mr Bede Hickey. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  So Mr Bede Hickey was her solicitor who drew the - <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  1989. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  - 1989 will?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Whereas Mr Turnell drew the 1987 will, is that correct?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  That is correct.   Mr Turnell was not her solicitor; Paul George's
solicitor.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I understand.   So you say on 7 December she instructed her
own solicitor, Mr Hickey?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  To do what?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Not Mr Hickey; the firm of Durham, Howard &amp; Fraser. <p>
HIS HONOUR:  Is this a new solicitor?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, it is. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  So Mr Hickey was on his own?<p>
<p>
ELLISON:  His practice was B Hickey, sole practitioner.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  And Bede was his first name?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  So she instructed her new solicitor - <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  - Mr Matthew Fraser.   <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  - Mr Matthew Fraser?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, of Durham Howard &amp; Fraser, to forward a letter to Paul George
and Paul George Pty Ltd stating that the 1987 deed
was unenforceable and should
be set aside on a number of grounds, to say the least that she had been a
victim of equitable fraud,
unconscionable conduct, and I will detail later,
your Honour, the bases of it - unilateral mistake, duress, unconscionable
conduct,
also claiming relief under the Contracts Review Act.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Presumably she was in a position to so instruct her solicitor?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, and, indeed, there will be evidence before you from Mr Fraser as
to the steps that he took to satisfy himself that
indeed she would so instruct
him.   He attended her house with an interpreter on 3 December 1989 for the
purpose of obtaining instructions
from her.  <p>
<p>
Ultimately proceedings were envisaged to be commenced by her to set aside the
1987 deed but on 19 October 1992 Habsie George died.
  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  What age would she have been in December 1989?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  She was born in 1898.  <p>
<p>
ELLISON:  Or 1897, depending what document you look at.<p>
Ninety-five or 94.   <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  What was she, 95 or 94?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Ninety-five or 94.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Does her doctor give any evidence as to her state of mind as it
must have been at that point?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  At her date of death, your Honour?<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  No, as at 3 December 1989.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  No, your Honour.  <p>
<p>
Then on 19 March 1993, as I have indicated to your Honour, probate was granted
to the will of Habsie George of 3 February 1989. 
Then these proceedings were
commenced by the executor of her estate on 14 May 1993.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Who is the plaintiff, John Francis George?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes.  The bases upon which we say we are entitled to have a
declaration that the deed is null and void and for it to be
set aside --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Sorry, to have a declaration that the 1987 <p>
deed -<p>
<p>
MARTIN: - is null and void and ought to be set aside are these, your Honour: <p>
<p>
The first basis is unconscionability in accordance with the principles
articulated by the High Court in Armadio, as your Honour is
well familiar with,
under a special disability, illiteracy, infirmity, virtual blindness and
deafness, her commercial inexperience,
her inability to understand and
comprehend English, her obviously impaired faculties and her advanced age; in
which the other party,
Paul George and Paul George Pty Ltd through Paul George,
knew of her special disadvantages which affected her ability, obviously,
to
look after her own interests in an obviously significant way and Paul George
Pty Ltd unconscientiously taking advantage of the
opportunity that presented
itself to obtain, by way of gift, a transfer of a significant asset of Habsie
George without any consideration.
<p>
<p>
The second basis is that of undue influence, in accordance with what the High
Court has said in Johnson v Buttress <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2056%20CLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 56 CLR 113</a>, that the relationship
between Habsie George on the one hand and Paul George and his company on the
other was such that a special
relationship of influence existed, having regard
to her position vis a vis Paul George's position, her position, her
disadvantaged
position, and the presumption of undue influence arises by reason
of that special relationship and, on the evidence, the onus shifts
to the
defence to rebut that presumption and, on the evidence, without a scintilla of
doubt we say that it is necessary for the defendant
to demonstrate that the
transfer was a pure, voluntary and well-understood act of mind of Habsie
George. In this case there is no
evidence to support that rebuttal. <p>
<p>
The next basis upon which the declaration of invalidity of the 1987 deed as
nomest factum has three elements that have been spelled
out by the High Court
in Patelin v Cullen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20132%20CLR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 132 CLR 355.</a>  The three elements to establish this
basis are that Habsie George was under a disability; secondly, that there was
sufficient difference
between the terms of the 1987 deed as it was and what
Habsie George believed it to be; three, that Habsie George, in the
circumstances
of her own position and condition had not acted carelessly.   We
say those elements have been made out here.  <p>
<p>
The next basis is on unilateral mistake, that Habsie George was mistaken as to
the contents of the 1987 deed and that Paul George
and his company knew of such
mistake, sitting by and allowing Habsie George to execute the document under
that mistaken belief.<p>
<p>
Lastly, your Honour, we rely on the provisions of the Contracts Review Act
relating to the unconscionability and special disadvantageous
position that
Habsie George was under at the time. <p>
<p>
Your Honour, I am sorry I have taken longer than I anticipated in opening.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  It is very helpful.  <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Your Honour, could I move to the affidavit evidence now?  <p>
<p>
ELLISON: Your Honour, before that takes place, bearing in mind the nature of my
friend's opening, would you permit me to make a brief
opening in reply?  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, that might be helpful. <p>
<p>
ELLISON: Not to be deliberately argumentative but to draw your Honour's
attention to other factual matters that flow from the documents
my friend has
referred to.  <p>
<p>
Your Honour, if I can just take your Honour to the chronology and you will see
the second entry has 29 May 1980.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Sorry, your chronology?<p>
<p>
ELLISON:  Yes, the defendants' chronology.  That should be 29 May 1990.  I will
bring up a corrected version in due course but your
Honour will see that 1980
was the first of three occasions, being May -<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Sorry, 1980 or 1990?<p>
<p>
ELLISON:  Sorry, 1990 was the second of three occasions, being 19 May 1988, 29
May 1990, the one I have corrected, and then 8 March
1993 in which Paul George
and John George were litigants in proceedings sometimes as plaintiff, sometimes
as defendant, sometimes
as cross-claimant, but in proceedings in relation to
caveats or the land the subject of these proceedings today.  <p>
<p>
At this stage I will not go into any more detail other than to say that on each
of those occasions such relief as may have been sought
by Paul George was
granted.  On each occasion, sometimes with other persons, John George did not
obtain the relief he sought and
was the subject of a costs order. <p>
<p>
Various caveats were lodged during the lifetime of Mrs George over various
properties the subject of these proceedings referring,
in a very general
fashion - you will have to be taken to them in due course - to the 1987
agreement and making certain allegations,
to the extent you could make them in
a caveat.   Those caveats either lapsed or were ordered to be removed.  There
is still one remaining
caveat on title.  I do not have the form with me. <p>
<p>
My friend was correct to say that Mr Turnell was instructed by Paul George.
However, your Honour, it is out contention that Mr Turnell's
firm was used
deliberately to use the services of a firm in the Gosford area that no one had
previously used, everyone else, including
Paul George, having their own
solicitors before and after.  <p>
<p>
My friend quite correctly says that the interpreter in his affidavit said that
he did not translate or explain the whole of the documents
to Mrs George.
However, your Honour, he gives direct conversation - he gives direct evidence -
of Mrs George interrupting him and,
in effect, summarising correctly what is in
the documents before her.  <p>
<p>
My friend did not indicate that there was, in fact, a third document executed
on 14 September 1987 at the solicitor's office, this
document being a document
not executed by the deceased, Habsie George, but by the plaintiff and, your
Honour, the solicitor, Mr Turnell,
whose file is here under subpoena, creates
on 14 September 1987 a two and a bit page, clearly contemporaneous, file note
in which
he reports for posterity the motions that were gone through that day
in his office.  <p>
<p>
That is, perhaps putting aside the parties and their witnesses in their
respective camps, your Honour, we would say ultimately the
best evidence of
what took place that day, certainly from someone who is entitled to be
considered an independent source of --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  When you say "independent" who were his clients?<p>
<p>
ELLISON:  Your Honour, I have said that he was instructed and initially
approached by Paul George.  The instructions for the wording
of the documents
came from Mr George, Paul George.  There is some correspondence in which he
sends documents to Mr Paul George for
discussion with others.  I think your
Honour, in a strict sense of retainer, Mr Paul George was his client but, as I
said, that firm
was retained so that no other firm that had been used before in
combat was retained. <p>
<p>
There is not much more, your Honour.  It is the case, your Honour, that there
are documents under subpoena in the Gosford Council
file which indicate that
near the end of 1987 the solicitors for Mrs George were corresponding with the
officers of Gosford Council
concerning matters of detail with regard to the
sub-division and this is the sub-division that was registered in January
1988.<p>
<p>
Your Honour, the firm of Mr Hickey did, in fact, draw the will but again, your
Honour, his file is in Court and whereas my friend,
probably from his point of
view,  went out of his way to say that it was my client who retained or
instructed the firm of Turnell,
it appears from the documentation in Mr
Hickey's file that Mr Hickey acted for John George, the plaintiff. <p>
<p>
Your Honour, I will not go into the basis of my friend's claim That is a matter
probably for submissions and contention.  However,
we will be vigorously
arguing, amongst other things, delay, bearing in mind from the plaintiff's
point of view the plaintiff was
upset or concerned about the deed within a
couple of months of it being executed. <p>
However, he did not do anything, ironically, until after obtaining probate, so
far as the commencement of these proceedings was concerned,
although solicitors
and barristers were retained and instructed at least from September 1989 on,
some three and a half years before
the death of the deceased.  <p>
<p>
Your Honour, just in conclusion - I will not need to stand up again at 2
o'clock or five past - it was our understanding, from a
reading of this case
that at least from my friend's point of view, putting aside the question of
logic, the only document that he
challenges is the deed of Habsie George of 14
September 1987.  If there are any other acts of hers, I would like to know. <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  If there are any other acts?<p>
<p>
ELLISON:   If there are any other acts of her which are suggested to fail
because of any of those bases, undue influence, Contracts
Review or whatever,
then I would like to be told sooner rather than later.  This is a case that
perhaps should have been on pleading
but has not.  We just take these things as
we go.<p>
<p>
The second thing your Honour is, having heard my friend's opening, I am not
quite sure if there is any basis of relief sought, certainly
against the third
defendant, although I am not appearing, but we would all like to know; and,
indeed, given that it is the company
who is the party to the deed, if this is
the only thing that is challenged, whether Mr Paul George as an individual, is
a proper
party. <p>
<p>
Finally - I might as well make this one now as leave it to the end - if an
attack is made on the persons who benefit under the deed,
is there some
explanation why Susan, or now Susan's estate, and her husband are not parties
to the litigation since they would be
otherwise adversely affected? <p>
LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Can I take your Honour to the first affidavit, that of John Francis
George sworn 13 July 1993?<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.  <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Does your Honour have that affidavit?<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I have that. <p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Does your Honour require me to read that affidavit?<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  No, I had better deal with objections to it at this stage. <p>
<p>
ELLISON: Your Honour, that brings me to the subject I was going to raise.  I am
conscious of the fact that your Honour may directions
- I certainly was not
present at the time - with regard to objections.<p>
<p>
For various reasons I can explain if required, we served no list of objections
on my friend, not having received anything from them.
  My solicitor went
around to the plaintiff's solicitor last night to inspect some documents and
was given for the first time a list
of objections.  <p>
<p>
So it is the case that we have not prepared a list and the list that my friend
has prepared was seen by me at 8 o'clock this morning.
 <p>
<p>
I can deal with some of them on the run.  In the light of the direction not
being complied with, I would ask that the affidavits
be admitted on both sides.
<p>
<p>
MARTIN: As I understand it, the direction made by your Honour at the last
directions hearing directed that notice of objections be
served on each side by
yesterday.   We say that we have complied with your Honour's direction. <p>
<p>
		(Discussion ensued.)<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  Are you prepared to accept your friends offer of waiving his if
you are prepared to waive yours?<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  No.  <p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  I think the only fair way to do it is that I will go through the
objections on the run which your friend is foreshadowing,
that means I will
consider both sides' objections even though one side is a day later. <p>

<p>
ELLISON:  Can I say for the record as I understand it what happened was that
the plaintiff served the affidavit in chief, my solicitor
then made available
the defendant's affidavits to the plaintiff of September 1993.  Those
affidavits were not filed but they were
replied to.  However the affidavits
that were filed in May of this year by, amongst other people, Paul George
wholly reflect the
paragraphs in the previous one but they were, to put it
bluntly, cleaned up a bit and some matters of irrelevancy or the like were
omitted.  So that when your Honour reads the affidavits in reply they are in
reply to the affidavits filed in May 1993.<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  Yes, there are some very minor differences but that won't trouble your
Honour. <p>

requiring the --<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  The only way of dealing with this is for the correspondence to be
produced.<p>
<p>
ELLISON: I will seek leave to call some evidence or something.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  I want to make it clear the proper way to deal with it is to
produce the correspondence.  If you intend to call evidence
in some other way,
he will no doubt object and no doubt I will uphold it.  <p>
<p>
LEAVE TO PRODUCE CORRESPONDENCE<p>
<p>
	(It was agreed that Dr Henderson give her evidence at 10am tomorrow morning)<p>
<p>
MARTIN:  There is no affidavit my friend is relying on disputing her evidence
from a medical point of view.<p>
<p>
ELLISON: Perhaps if my friend and I can get into evidence and have your Honour
read the interpreter's affidavit before Dr Henderson
gives her evidence and the
solicitor's file note which your Honour was going to see in due course in the
bundle of documents because
that is the most crucial part of the case.<p>
<p>
MARTIN: There is a fundamental problem.  I can tell Mr Ellison this.  At this
stage in relation to getting into evidence the file
note of Mr Turnell, if my
friend wants that document in we require Mr Turnell to be called and for us to
be afforded the opportunity
of cross-examining him.<p>
<p>
	(Mr Martin stated that the file note had been included in error in the
plaintiff;s bundle of documents.<p>
<p>
	Mr Ellison stated his instructing solicitor had 	issued the subpoena..<p>
<p>
	Mr Ellison submitted that the file note was admissible 	under s14CE of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  Document handed up)<p>
<p>
	(Mr Ellison sought and was granted access to subpoenaed documents)<p>
<p>
	(Discussion ensued relating to which parties Mr Turnell had been acting for)<p>
<p>
	(Mr Martin stated he would be tendering a number of documents on the
application and submitted that Mr Turnell's file note be rejected
under s14CF
and 14CP of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>)<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  We might resume on this matter tomorrow at 10 o'clock.  The only
qualification is Dr Henderson.  Is it necessary for
the purpose of your
cross-examination Mr Ellison that you deal with this matter of evidence
first?<p>
<p>
ELLISON: No, I thought the court would be assisted by having it.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  I am simply looking at the convenience of the witness and asking
whether there is any prejudice to you if she is dealt
with at 10 o'clock and
can go back to her patients?<p>
<p>
ELLISON: None whatsoever your Honour.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  What I will do is deal with Dr Henderson first;  then we will deal
with this question of evidence and also I think there
is a matter of an
affidavit being looked at overnight from 1983 of Mrs George.<p>
<p>
ELLISON: And there is my <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12</a> request for counsel's advice.<p>
<p>
HIS HONOUR:  We will deal with all that after Dr Henderson.<p>
<p>
	(Mr Ellison sought and was granted photocopy access to the affidavit of his
client from the 1981 file)<p>
<p>
	In the interests of saving time it would be helpful if before court starts
tomorrow you and your friend could look at the remainder
of your affidavits and
see whether you can reduce the matters that I have to deal with by way of
objection to a minimum.   I will
rule in a similar way to the way I have ruled
up to now.<p>
<p>
ADJOURNED TO 10AM FRIDAY 12 MAY 1995<p>
