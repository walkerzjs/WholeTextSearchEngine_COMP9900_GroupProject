<b><u>10079/99  -  SUNCORP GENERAL INSURANCE LTD  v  I M ENGINEERING PTY
LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>10080/99  -  I M ENGINEERING PTY LIMITED  v  SUNCORP GENERAL INSURANCE
LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 9 September 1998, Mr Morahan, Local Court
Magistrate at Newcastle, heard a claim by I M Engineering Pty Limited ("I M
Engineering")
against its public risk insurer, Suncorp Insurance Ltd ("Suncorp
Insurance").  He made certain orders.  Both parties seek to challenge
those
orders by way of Stated Case.
<P>

<b>The Provision of a Quotation</b>
<P>

2  	I M Engineering carried on business at Kooragang Island, near
Newcastle.  It was part of a group of companies.  The other companies
in the
group included I M Cranes Pty Limited, and Newcastle Woodchipping Pty
Limited.
<P>

3  	The Group retained brokers, the AIBA Group, to obtain public risk
insurance on its behalf.  The person within the AIBA Group
responsible for
obtaining insurance was Mr John McMahon.
<P>

4  	Mr McMahon solicited quotations from a number of insurers.  On 30
January 1996 he sent a fax to Suncorp Insurance.  It included
the following:
<P>

"As discussed slip for above Zurich quoting $5700 + S/D. Please advise
soonest."
<P>

5  	The fax was accompanied by a typewritten document which included
the following:
<P>

"<b>BUSINESS:</b>	Principally CRANE HIRE, DEMOLITION AND WOODCHIPPING and all
other activities incidental thereto."
<P>

6  	Indemnity was sought, amongst other things, for the insured's
legal liability to pay compensation in respect of the following:
<P>

"Damage to Property (which expression includes loss of property) arising out of
or in connection with the Insured's Business and
Products."
<P>

7  	Under the heading "Other Underwriting Information", the brokers
included these words:
<P>

<center>"CLAIMS  -  NIL KNOWN"</center>
<P>


<P>

8  	Mr Covel, an underwriter with Suncorp Insurance, received the
request.  Before responding, he required further information.
 He therefore
telephoned Mr McMahon.  He made a contemporaneous note of their conversation.
The note included the following:
<P>

"No longer involved in crane hire or demolition in the past ? 5 years.
<P>

...
<P>

Claims `nil known' at least 5 yrs."
<P>

9  	Mr Covel also made a note that the insured was involved in
manufacturing sheet metal, "i.e. hopper, conveyers".
<P>

10  	On 1 February 1996, the broker provided further information by
fax, including the following:
<P>

"Confirming nil claims last five years - no demolition."
<P>

11  	The file copy of Mr McMahon's fax of 1 February 1996 held by
Suncorp Insurance, included the words "13 yrs no claims" in the
handwriting of
Mr Covel.  Mr Covel explained that the annotations on the document, including
the reference to thirteen years, were
made during a further telephone
discussion with Mr McMahon.  Mr McMahon denied having suggested to Mr Covel
that I M Engineering
had a history of not having made claims over a thirteen
year period.  When cross examined, Mr Covel said this:  (Exhibit A, p15)
<P>

"Q.	No, Mr McMahon never told you there were 13 years with no claims.  He told
you there were five, didn't he?
<P>

A.	The written confirmation says five years.
<P>

Q.	No, you don't remember him saying there's 13 years of no claims?
<P>

A.	I don't remember him saying it in that conversation, no.  I don't remember
the conversation word for word."
<P>

12  	Mr Covel gave evidence that the further information provided by
the broker on 1 February 1996 enabled him to reduce the amount
which he would
otherwise have offered for the public liability component by $1,800.
<P>

13  	On 1 February 1996, Suncorp Insurance quoted $4,550 in respect
of I M Engineering, and $1,100 in respect of Newcastle Woodchip.
 The brokers
accepted the offer the same day.  Mr Covel later completed a file note
(6.2.96), which included the following:
<P>

"(i)	Despite the Insured's occupation shown as including `crane hire' and
`demolition', John advised that the crane hire related
to internal arrangements
only, whilst the Insured has not been involved with any demolition work for at
least the past five (5) years,
nor do they intend on becoming involved in
demolition work in the future.
<P>

....
<P>

(iv)	The location does not have any surrounding third party property exposes,
as the Insured property is located on a corner block
with the nearest third
party being at least 20 metres away from their location."
<P>

14  	The memorandum concluded with these words:
<P>

"Zurich have quoted $1,200 for the wood chipping operation and $4,500 for the
engineering operations.
<P>

AIBA only have to slightly beat the deal to retain the account.
<P>

We would prefer at least $5,000 Gross for the engineering and $1,750 for the
wood chipping operation.  However, we were prepared
to reduce our terms to
$4,500 and $1,100 respectively, provided we won both accounts."
<P>

15  	On 22 February 1996, I M Engineering completed two proposal
forms, one in respect of the public liability insurance, and the
other in
respect of product liability insurance.  The forms contained the usual
declarations that the answers and information were
"true and correct in all
respects".
<P>

16  	In the public liability insurance proposal the business was
described in these words:
<P>

<center> "Engineering Fabrication"</center>
<P>


<P>

17  	In the companion form, dealing with products liability, the
following answers were provided in respect of the products manufactured:
<P>

"(f)	Describe briefly any Quality Control or Testing programs in place.
<P>

BHP  Test  Paint - Welds."
<P>

18  	The public liability proposal specifically required the proposer
to provide full details of past claims.  It said this:
<P>

"(d)	Has anyone comprising the Insured either alone or jointly with others
ever:
<P>

(i)	been refused any type of insurance, or had special terms imposed?
<P>

(ii)	claimed for any insurance whatsoever?"
<P>

19  	The question was accompanied by two boxes, one for "yes" and the
other for "no".  I M Engineering ticked the "yes" box opposite
question
(d)(ii), signifying that there had been claims.  The form, naturally, required
an elaboration.  The following appears in
the form:
<P>

"If `Yes' to Questions (d) or (e) state full details.
<P>

`Motor vehicle claims.'"
<P>

20  	The form also required the proposer to identify the previous
insurer.  "C E Heath" was identified.
<P>

21  	The insurer did not seek further information.  Nor, one gathers,
did it approach C E Heath.  The policy was issued.  When issued,
curiously, it
described the business of I M Engineering in these terms:
<P>

"Principally Crane Hire, Demolition and Woodchipping and all other activities
incidental thereto."
<P>

<b>The Claims History</b>
<P>

22  	I M Engineering had in fact made a number of claims.  The claims
were each characterised as arising "in respect of paint overspray
incidents".
One gathers that airborne spray paint was carried to adjacent premises, causing
damage, principally to parked cars. 
Mr Covel identified the previous claims as
follows:
<P>

"i.	on 25 July 1988 - Norwich.
<P>

ii.	on 19 December 1988 - Norwich.
<P>

iii.	on 1 June 1990 - Norwich.
<P>

iv.	on 12 January 1993 - CE Heath (`the 1993 incident').
<P>

v.	in February 1996 - HIH Winterthur (`the 1996 incident')."
<P>

23  	The "1993 incident" involved nine cars.  Proceedings were
commenced in the Local Court.  The broker, Mr McMahon, gave the following
evidence in relation to that claim:
<P>

"I understand there was an overspray incident what your client vehemently
denied and there was dubious circumstances surrounding
their liability for that
particular incident and that the matter apparently was taken to, I believe, an
arbitration tribunal and
was subsequently lost, on what grounds I don't know.
the client then, believing he was not liable, although judgment was made
against
him, apparently went to the then underwriter, HIH to seek reimbursement
of the costs involved."
<P>

24  	HIH Winterthur, however, declined to indemnify I M Engineering
in respect of the judgment, on the basis of late notification.
<P>

25  	After Mr McMahon solicited the quotation from Suncorp Insurance
(on 1 February 1996), and before the proposal (on 22 February
1996), I M
Engineering was made aware of a further claim.  The claim was made by BHP.  It
was said to have arisen out of a spraying
incident on 16 January 1996.  The
claim was notified by letter dated 7 February 1996.
<P>

<b>The Claim Against Suncorp Insurance</b>
<P>

26  	In the week commencing 2 September 1996, a further incident
occurred.  Hammersley Chemicals (Aust) Pty Limited asserted that
paint,
originating from I M Engineering, was carried to its premises, causing damage.
Proceedings were instituted in the Local Court.
 Suncorp Insurance declined to
indemnify I M Engineering.  The company, therefore, defended itself.  The
matter was first taken to
arbitration, and then the Court.  The proceedings
were ultimately settled for $21,000, with each party to pay its own costs.
There
was no suggestion that that was not a proper sum.
<P>

27  	I M Engineering, thereafter, commenced the proceedings which
came before Mr Morahan to recover from Suncorp Insurance its outlay,
namely,
$21,000, together with costs totalling $8,054.
<P>

<b>Evidence from the Underwriter</b>
<P>

28  	Mr Covel, the underwriter at Suncorp Insurance who wrote the
policy, provided a statement.  He also gave evidence.  The statement,
under the
heading "Non-disclosure", identified a number of matters.  They included the
claims made by I M Engineering upon various
insurers between 1988 and 1996, and
the following:
<P>

"(ix)	IM Engineering Pty Ltd's brochure indicates that its occupation is of a
much larger scale, and involves a wider scope of engineering
services than had
been disclosed to Suncorp.  The brochure indicates that the services include
industrial maintenance and shutdown
work, steel fabrication and erection,
mechanical installation, labour hire, asbestos removal, sandblasting and
painting, roof cladding
and sheeting, crane hire and civil works.  This
indicates a much higher off premises component to the risk than the 10 percent
figure
quoted by the broker.  This together with a subsequent increase in
Completed Operations/Products Liability exposure, creates a much
more hazardous
exposure than the one contemplated at inception.
<P>

(x)	IM Engineering Pty Ltd's activities include outdoor spray painting
operations.  This part of the Insured's business was known
(sic semble unknown)
to the broker ..."
<P>

29  	Mr Covel, upon the basis of such non-disclosures, provided the
following opinion:
<P>

"13.	Had IM Engineering Pty Ltd disclosed, prior to inception of the risk, all,
or any one, of the matters referred to in paragraph
12 hereof, I can say, based
on my experience with Suncorp and my understanding of its underwriting policy,
that, because the nature
of the risk is not such as comprises a core business
risk for Suncorp:
<P>

(i)	Suncorp would have declined to quote on the risk;  or
<P>

(ii)	if it had quoted on the risk, would have quoted on terms that were so
expensive as to have rendered the quote uncompetitive,
particularly having
regard to the quote by Zurich referred to in paragraph 8(I) herein;  or
<P>

(iii)	applied an exclusion for spray painting claims in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`We will not be liable for claims arising directly or indirectly out of or
caused by, through, or in connection with spray painting
outside an approved
dedicated spray painting enclosure.'</i>"
<P>

30  	There is in that opinion an element of hyperbole.  Some of the
separate paragraphs said not to have been disclosed, would hardly
have been
likely, by themselves, to have caused Suncorp Insurance to have declined to
quote on the risk.  The brochure, moreover,
was arguably irrelevant.  There was
no indication as to when it was produced.  It is plain from the conversations
between Mr Covel
and the broker that the insured's business had undergone
change.  The risk was constituted by the insured's present business, and
its
likely business during the currency of the policy.
<P>

31  	Mr Covel does not, in paragraph 13, define what he means by an
"uncompetitive rate", except by reference to the Zurich quotation.
Unfortunately, when cross examined, he was not asked to elaborate.  Nor was he
asked to identify the underwriting policy of Suncorp
Insurance.  No document
was produced which had currency within that insurance company, designed to
guide underwriters when assessing
risks.
<P>

32  	Mr McMahon, the broker from AIBA Group, was called as a witness
on behalf of I M Engineering.  He had some underwriting experience,
although
not as much as Mr Covel.  His statement included the following paragraphs,
which were objected to:
<P>

"11.	I disagree with the conclusions contained in paragraph 13 of Mr Covel's
statement and say that Suncorp would have accepted
the risk even if it had been
fully informed of IME's claims history for the past 5 years.  The practice in
the insurance industry
is for an insurer to only require prior claims history
for up to 3 and possibly 5 years at the most.  It is only in exception
circumstances
that an insurer would require details of the claims history
beyond a period of 5 years.  I am not aware of any circumstances that
would
make the present case exceptional.
<P>

13	I say that had Suncorp or any other prudent insurer been aware in detail of
the Company's claims records then at most it would
have accepted the risk with
perhaps an increased excess.  In relation, however, to Suncorp at the
particular time I am aware that
Suncorp was keen to obtain business at that
time and do not consider that Suncorp would have proceeded differently even
with full
information of the Company's claims record in terms of both
acceptance of the risk the premium charged and the excess applied."
<P>

33  	These paragraphs, wrongly I believe, were rejected by the Local
Court Magistrate.  What a prudent insurer may have done may
be relevant to a
determination of what Suncorp Insurance was likely to have done had proper
disclosure been made (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act, 1984</a>:  <b><i>Lynch v
Zurich Australia Insurance Ltd</i></b> (unreported, C of A (NSW), 10 November
1998, per Giles JA).  However, no issue is raised by I M Engineering in its
Stated Case concerning
the rejection of that evidence.
<P>

34  	There was evidence, however, that Suncorp Insurance was actively
seeking new business.  Mr McMahon gave evidence that he had
been approached by
a representative of that insurer, Mr Oakman, who said this:
<P>

"We are keen to expand our business in New South Wales and would look
favourably on any insurance proposals.  We would welcome an
opportunity to
quote on any new insurance business."
<P>

35  	Mr Covel, when cross examined, acknowledged that in early 1996
Suncorp Insurance was trying to expand its business.  He said
this:
<P>

"Q.	In New South Wales and that there'd been a Road Show amongst other
promotions to try and drum up business?
<P>

A.	We had been actively marketing, yes."
<P>

36  	Mr Covel knew that the business of I M Engineering involved the
fabrication of steel hoppers and conveyers.  He expected that
they would be
painted.  In re-examination he was asked the following:
<P>

"Q.	Is there any reason for you to think that hoppers would be painted other
than indoors?
<P>

A.	They sometimes can be also painted outdoors but you expect some sort of
draping or some sort of protection to prevent the overspray
from occurring."
<P>

37  	The products liability proposal, as set out above, specifically
referred to painting.
<P>

<b>The Magistrate's Determination</b>
<P>

38  	The Local Court Magistrate, having heard the evidence, delivered
an extempore judgment.  Referring to Mr Covel's statement,
he said this:
<P>

"Paragraph 12 of Mr Covel's statement sets out the matters he says were not
disclosed to the insurer when assessing the risk and
at paragraph 13 he states
the position the insurer would have adopted if full disclosure had been made.
This last paragraph is of
course, a matter of conjecture.  All insurers say
such things when faced with a claim they do not wish to meet."
<P>

39  	Mr Morahan, having referred to some of the evidence, including
the company's eagerness to write new business, gave judgement
in these
terms:
<P>

"Mr Marshall, counsel for the insured, submits that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21(iii)</a> of the Act refers
to the proposal form only which is, as I said earlier, contains the notation in
relation to prior claims which
was not followed up by the insurer.
<P>

Mr Cheney also submits that there is no independent evidence from an expert
witness for the insured as to the effect of non disclosure.
 The Court must
accept the insurer's case and dismiss the third party action.  I do not
agree.
<P>

On the evidence I am satisfied that Suncorp was determined to get new business,
including the defendant's, and in all likelihood
would have simply adjusted the
premium (or) excess to do so.  The fact that the insurer ignored the reference
in the proposal form
for past claims, and adopted the interpretation it did is
some confirmation of this.  I do not accept that the insured can seek to
rely
solely on the fax sent by Mr McMahon to Mr Covel, and selectively ignore the
contents of the proposal form.
<P>

It seems to me that fault can be found on both sides in relation to the
contract of insurance.  That being so am I to apply <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3)</a> of the Act and
reduce the liability of the insurer in respect of the claim to the amount that
would place it in a position which
it would have been if the failure had not
occurred, or the misrepresentation had not been made.  The only figures
available to the
Court are those that have been quoted by the other insurer,
HIH.
<P>

It is my view that the insurer is not entitled to avoid the contract, but its
liability should be reduced in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3)</a> of the Act.  I propose to
do this by adding the premium on excess quoted by HIH, thus making a total of
$13,000 and, ignoring the
stamp duty, subtract the premium of $4,450 paid to
Suncorp which leaves a balance of $8,459.  I ignore the excess of $500.
<P>

Subtracting this from the settlement figure, judgment on the settlement figure
of $21,000, judgment will be entered in favour of
the defendant against the
third party in the sum of $12,500.
<P>

I was proposing to order that each party pay their own costs ..."
<P>

<b>The Contentions of Suncorp Insurance</b>
<P>

40  	It is implicit in the short judgment of the learned Magistrate
that he found non-disclosure by I M Engineering.  The Stated
Case, prepared on
behalf of Suncorp Insurance, purported to identify the findings of fact made by
Mr Morahan.  It said this:
<P>

"9.	That prior to the contract of insurance being made, the Defendant did not
disclose to the Third Party the following matters,
being matters material to
the Third Party's assessment of the risk (`the non-disclosure')....."
<P>

41  	Nine separate matters were then set out.  They included (para 1)
the five claims made by I M Engineering between 1988 and February
1996.  They
also included the following:
<P>

"(2)	In respect of the 1993 incident, the Defendant was in 1993 the recipient
of claims by 9 employees of the plaintiff in these
proceedings arising from
allegations that the Defendant had, in January 1993, caused paint overspray
damage to vehicles owned by
those 9 employees;
<P>

(3)	One employee, a Ms Johnson, commenced Local Court proceedings No 26017 of
1993 (`the Johnson claim');
<P>

(4)	The Defendant denied liability in the Johnson claim;
<P>

(5)	The Defendant was found liable in the Johnson claim in arbitration
proceedings;
<P>

(6)	The Defendant made a claim upon its then insurer in respect of the Johnson
claim, Heath Insurance, but was denied indemnity
on the ground of late
notification;
<P>

(7)	In respect of the 1996 incident, the Defendant was the recipient of a claim
in about February 1996 by Port Waratah Coal Services
Limited's (`PWCS') arising
out of an allegation that the Defendant caused paint overspray damage to PCWS
company vehicles and private
vehicles (more than 32 in number) (`the PWCS
claim');
<P>

(8)	The Defendant's activities include outdoor spray painting operations."
<P>

42  	No such findings appear in his Worship's reasons.  The outdoor
spray painting operation were, arguably, matters implicit in
the material
disclosed (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21(2)(c)).</a>  Mr Covel would have expected outdoor painting.
<P>

43  	The draft Stated Case, including paragraph 9, was served upon
the solicitors for I M Engineering.  It was signed by the learned
Magistrate,
apparently without amendment, and without argument.  In my view, the only
material non-disclosure was the claims history.
 No doubt some of the other
material would have emerged had the claims been separately identified.  I
notice that, when counsel for
the insurer opened the case, he said this:
<P>

"We say that the insured defendant failed to disclose its prior claim's history
to us and had we known about that we wouldn't have
undertaken the policy."
<P>

44  	Even in respect of the disclosure of past claims, some of the
older claims were, arguably, immaterial.  Mr Covel gave the following
evidence:
(T.12)
<P>

"Q.	Sir, it's unusual from your day to day carrying out of your job that your
client goes back past 5 years, (doesn't) it?
<P>

A.	Normally being prudent from an underwriter's perspective to ask for five
years' claim experience.
<P>

Q.	Sometimes it's three, isn't it?
<P>

A.	Brokers, as they are, they normally minimise things they're required to do
but a prudent underwriter would request five years."
<P>

45  	Suncorp Insurance, in substance, identified three errors.
<P>

*	First, that the Magistrate had erred in law in failing to accept the opinion
of Mr Covel, which was described as "unchallenged".
 Alternatively, the basis
upon which the Magistrate rejected such evidence ("all insurers say such things
when faced with a claim
they do not wish to meet.") was either unfounded, or
betrayed bias on his part.
<P>

*	Secondly, that Mr McMahon's evidence that the "company (HIH Winterthur) was
fully aware of IME's then claims history", was inadmissible.
 It was hearsay.
It was objected to, and ought to have been rejected.
<P>

*	Thirdly, that his Worship was in error in using the premium charged by HIH
Winterthur as the basis for determining what Suncorp
Insurance would have done
had proper disclosure been made <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s28(3)).</a>
<P>

46  	I will deal with each matter in turn.
<P>

<b>The Opinion of Mr Covel</b>
<P>

47  	Mr Covel's evidence was not "unchallenged".  He was cross
examined about the eagerness of his employers to write new business,
and his
knowledge of the risk.  He was not, however, specifically challenged in respect
of his opinion (para 13).
<P>

48  	Nonetheless, the Court was not obliged to accept that opinion.
In <b><i>Temiha v Sadebarth </i></b>(unreported, C of A (NSW), 13 May 1997)
Powell JA (with whom Beazley and Stein JJA agreed) expressed the principle in
these terms:
<P>

"Although some of the older cases (see, for example, <i>David v Hardy</i>
((1827) <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1826/791.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1826] EngR 791</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=6%20B%20%26%20C%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">6 B &amp; C 225</a>, 231;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1826/791.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1826] EngR 791</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=108%20ER%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">108 ER 436</a>, 348 per Abbott CJ);  <i>Richards v
Jager</i> ([1909] VLR 140, 147 per Madden CJ);  <i>Swinburne v David Syme &amp;
Co</i> ([1909] VLR 550, 565 per Madden CJ) seem to proceed upon the basis that,
as a general rule, where a witness is unimpeached in his
general character and
his evidence is probable and uncontradicted by evidence on the other side that
evidence should be accepted,
more recent authority makes it clear that there is
no rule of law that a Court or judge must accept evidence because it is all the
one way (see, for example, <i>McPhee v S Bennett Ltd </i>((1935)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=52%20WN%208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">52 WN 8)</a> and
that while the absence of cross-examination enables a tribunal of fact to
regard the relevant evidence with a greater degree
of assurance than might
otherwise have been the case, it does not require the acceptance of that
evidence (see, for example <i>Douglas v Tiernan</i> ((1931) 32 SR 149, 153 per
Harvey J);  <i>Taylor v Ellis</i> ([1956] VLR 457;  <i>Cole v Commonwealth of
Australia </i>((1961) 62 SR 700);  <i>Bulstrode v Trimble</i> ([1970] VR 840);
<i>Poricanin v Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd </i>([1979]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20NSWLR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 NSWLR 419)</a>;
<i>Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commission of Taxation </i>([1983]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1
NSWLR 1)</a>;  <i>Paric v John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd </i>([1984] 2 NSWLR
505), although where such evidence is rejected the reasons for its being
rejected should be stated, in default of
which it might be held that there had
been a mistrial (see, for example, <i>Holman v Holman</i> ((1964) 81 WN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Pt 1)</a>
374);  <i>Torrealba v District Court of New South Wales </i>((1996)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=40%20NSWLR%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">40 NSWLR
327))."</a>
<P>

49  	What reasons did his Worship provide for not accepting Mr
Covel's opinion?  Three reasons emerge from the judgment, although
they are
scattered throughout.
<P>

*	First, his Worship observed, accurately, that, in the nature of things, the
opinion provided by Mr Covel was given with the wisdom
of hindsight.  It is a
matter of "conjecture" as to what the insurer would have done had full
disclosure been made.
<P>

*	Secondly, his Worship plainly gave some weight to the aggressive marketing of
Suncorp Insurance.  It was anxious to quote on new
business.  Adjustments could
be made to the price, as well as the excess, as his Worship's ultimate order
demonstrates.
<P>

*	Thirdly, his Worship referred to "all insurers" saying things along the lines
of Mr Covel's opinion.  That is a somewhat sweeping
statement.  No doubt his
Worship may have chosen some other expression were he writing a reserved
judgment.  However, his Worship
was really saying no more than that the
insurer, having rejected the claim, for reasons which appeared to it
sufficient, will, of
course, seek to defend that decision, just as Mr Covel had
defended his rejection of I M Engineering's claim.  What must be examined
is
not so much the expression of opinion, although that is important, but the
reasons for that opinion.
<P>

50  	Here, weighing up the risks (paint overspray), the relevant
claims history (probably no more than five years), the fact that
such history
was unfortunate, although hardly catastrophic, as well as the eagerness of the
insurer for new business, his Worship
reached the opinion already set out,
namely:
<P>

"On the evidence I am satisfied that Suncorp was determined to get new
business, including the defendant's, and in all likelihood
would have simply
adjusted the premium (or) excess to do so."
<P>

51  	There is no basis, in my view, to apprehend bias against
insurers generally, or Suncorp Insurance, in particular.  There was
no error of
law.  I would therefore reject the first ground.
<P>

<b>The Wrongful Admission of Evidence</b>
<P>

52  	Moving to the second ground identified by Suncorp Insurance, Mr
McMahon, the broker called by I M Engineering, provided a statement.
 The
statement included the following:
<P>

"At the time of asking Suncorp to quote on the insurance in question, renewal
of IME's insurance was available through the then
insurer HIH Winterthur.
<i>That company was fully aware of IME's then claims history.</i>  Terms were
also offered by Zurich Insurance through another broker in relation to the same
cover."  (emphasis added)
<P>

53  	Objection was taken to the statement in italics on the basis
that it was hearsay.  His Worship ruled as follows:  (Exhibit
A, p21)
<P>

"I am prepared to allow that.  It's something you can clarify in cross
examination if need be ......"
<P>

54  	The statement by Mr McMahon was plainly a statement of his
belief.  He and Mr Covel had negotiated the insurance contract.
 However, their
role in the proceedings extended beyond their involvement as witnesses to what
had taken place.  Each provided opinion
evidence.  Mr Covel, for instance, on
the same issue, said this:  (Exhibit A, p13)
<P>

"Q.	You've now inspected the broker's files and you'd be reasonably satisfied
that HIH Winterthur were content to continue the policy
although it was a
higher rate - a higher premium and higher excess?
<P>

A.	That's correct, yes."
<P>

55  	The statement by Mr McMahon did not set out the basis of his
belief.  However, HIH Winterthur had been the insurer for some
time.  It was
the insurer at the time of the incident on 13 January 1996, which was part of
the undisclosed claims history.  HIH
Winterthur was, therefore, the party to
whom I M Engineering would look for indemnity in respect of that claim.  It is
reasonable
to suppose that HIH Winterthur was aware of that claim.  Further,
the normal excess on a public risk insurance policy for an industrial
enterprise was said to be $200 or $500.  HIH Winterthur had fixed an excess of
$5,000.  That sum rather suggests that HIH Winterthur
was well aware of the
claims history.
<P>

56  	These matters were not explored with Mr McMahon.  In the light
of his Worship's ruling (permitting the evidence), they should
have been.  The
evidence, although hearsay, may well have come within the exceptions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/index.html#p3.2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3.2</a>
Div 2 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a>.  Had it emerged that Mr McMahon had no proper
basis for his statement, counsel could have renewed his objection.
<P>

57  	I do not believe, in the circumstances, that there is substance
in the second ground.
<P>

<b>The Use of the HIH Winterthur Quotation</b>
<P>

58  	Suncorp Insurance asserted non-disclosure by I M Engineering.
The Court appears to have accepted that assertion.  It was not
suggested,
however, that I M Engineering had been guilty of fraud, or fraudulent
misrepresentation (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(2)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act, 1984</a>).  His Worship
determined, in these circumstances, that the insurer was not entitled to avoid
the contract.  He, therefore, confronted
the issue raised by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3).</a>  He used
the quotation by HIH Winterthur in an effort to place Suncorp Insurance in the
position it would have been had there been
full disclosure.
<P>

59  	The objection by Suncorp Insurance substantially rests upon the
suggested inadmissibility of Mr McMahon's opinion, which is
the subject of the
second ground, which I have dealt with.
<P>

60  	In my view, there was evidence before the Magistrate.  It was
reasonable for him to use the quotation of HIH Winterthur as
a basis for the
calculation which he then made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3).</a>
<P>

61  	There is, therefore, no substance in the third complaint against
the Magistrate's judgment.
<P>

62  	Accordingly, from the viewpoint of Suncorp Insurance, there was
no error in his Worship's judgment.  Their appeal should be
dismissed.
<P>

63  	I now turn to the complaints of I M Engineering in the separate
Stated Case lodged on its behalf.
<P>

<b>The Complaints of I M Engineering</b>
<P>

64  	The complaints against the Court's findings made on behalf of I
M Engineering were, in substance, as follows:
<P>

*	First, that the Court was in error in not finding that the insurer had waived
compliance with the duty of disclosure.  The waiver
was said to arise under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act, 1984</a>, through the insurer having failed
to follow up certain answers by the insured, which were obviously
incomplete.
<P>

*	Secondly, in circumstances of waiver, there was no need for the Court to
undertake the calculation which would otherwise be required
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act, 1984</a>.  The amount claimed by I M Engineering,
therefore, should not have been discounted.
<P>

*	Thirdly, and in any event, that I M Engineering succeeded in its claim,
although not for the full amount.  It should, therefore,
have been awarded
costs.
<P>

*	Fourthly, that there was an error of law in awarding only $4,000 of the costs
which had been incurred in defending the action
brought by Hammersley Chemical
(Aust) Pty Limited, rather than the full amount paid ($8,052).
<P>

65  	It is convenient to deal with the first and second issues
together.  If the first ground fails, the issue in respect of the
second ground
does not arise.    In other words, if there was no error by the Court in
respect of waiver, then it was appropriate
to address the issues arising under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s28(3).</a>  I will deal at the same time with the third issue, relating to
costs.
<P>

<b>Was there a Waiver?</b>
<P>

66  	A number of representations had been made to the underwriter
that no claims had been made for at least five years by I M Engineering
under
its public risk insurance.  However, the proposal form, when completed, stated
that there had been previous claims.  In answer
to the requirement that the
insured "supply full details", the company said:  "Motor vehicle claims".
<P>

67  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 21</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act, 1984</a>, deals with an
insured's duty of disclosure.  The Act makes the following provision:
<P>

"21(2)  The duty of disclosure does not require the disclosure of a matter:
<P>

(d)	as to which compliance with the duty of disclosure is waived by the
insurer."
<P>

68  	Reversing the Common Law position (cf <b><i>C R Ogden and Co Pty
Ltd v Reliance Fire Sprinkler Co Ltd</i></b> ([1973]  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=2%20NSWLR%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">2 NSWLR 7)</a> per MacFarlan
J), s21(3) identifies certain circumstances in which there will be a waiver.
It makes the following provision:
<P>

"21(3)  Where a person:
<P>

(a)	failed to answer;  or
<P>

(b)	gave an obviously incomplete or irrelevant answer to:
<P>

a question included in a proposal form about a matter, the insurer shall be
deemed to have waived compliance with the duty of disclosure
in relation to the
matter."
<P>

69  	Here the answer "motor vehicle claims" was provided in the
proposal form.  Should it be characterised as an "obviously incomplete
or
irrelevant answer", such that the insurer must pursue it, or be taken to have
waived the requirements of full disclosure for past
claims?
<P>

70  	The argument is finely balanced.  The claims which were not
fully disclosed could, in one sense, be described as "motor vehicle
claims".
They involved, in each case, damage to motor vehicles caused through airborne
spray painting from the the adjacent premises
of I M Engineering.  Moreover,
the answer was provided in the context of a public risk proposal.  They were
"motor vehicle claims"
said to arise "out of, or in connection with, the
Insured's Business or Products".  The insurer, on the other hand, asserted that
the words "motor vehicle claims" suggested an altogether different type of
claim, such that it was not put on inquiry.
<P>

71  	His Worship (by inference) determined that there had been no
waiver.  I do not believe that an error of law is manifest in
such a
determination.  I would therefore dismiss the first ground.  The second falls
as a consequence.
<P>

72  	On the issue of costs, his Worship, with respect, adroitly
balanced the justice of each party's position.  He determined as
follows:
<P>

*	First, that there had been material non-disclosure (of the claims
history).
<P>

*	Secondly, (by inference) that there had not been waiver.
<P>

*	Thirdly, that the insurer was, by reason of the non-disclosure,
disadvantaged.  Nonetheless, it was eager for business and would
have written
the business, but upon a different basis.  His Worship selected as an
appropriate measure of the adjusted premium, for
the purposes of s28(3), the
premium demanded by the insurer which Suncorp Insurance was replacing (namely
HIH Winterthur).
<P>

*	Fourthly, that, with respect to the action, each party had succeeded in part,
and failed in part.  Each should pay its own costs.
<P>

73  	On the issue of costs, clearly the Magistrate had a broad
discretion.  An appellate Court should not interfere with a costs
order in the
absence of "material and significant mistake" (per Priestley JA (with whom
Mason P and Sheller JA agreed) in <b><i>Schnitzenbaumer v District Court of New
South Wales &amp; Ors </i></b>(unreported, C of A (NSW), 15 July 1998)).
<P>

74  	I do not believe that it can be said there was error in respect
of the costs order made by his Worship.
<P>

<b>The Apportionment of Legal Costs</b>
<P>

75  	Dealing with the final complaint of I M Engineering, his Worship
said this:
<P>

"... in relation to the action between the plaintiff and the defendant because
the third party is the insurer of the defendant,
it's my view that it is
appropriate to make an order because the third party was in a position to
indemnify the defendant.
<P>

The rounded off figure is a figure of $8,000.  I appreciate that disbursements
may well be extra in relation to that, however I
think that is an appropriate
fee and I propose to direct that the third party pay the defendant's costs in
relation to the plaintiff
and defendant action of $4,000 being half of the
rounded off figure of $8,000, which is roughly in accordance with the
apportionment
that I have made in relation to the third party action and I
formally allow twenty eight days for payment."
<P>

76  	Given the findings made in the principal claim by I M
Engineering, and given the broad discretion on such issues, such a finding
does
not, in my view, involve an error of law.
<P>

<b>Order</b>
<P>

77  	I therefore make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I dismiss the appeal by way of Stated Case by Suncorp Insurance Limited
(matter number 10079/99).
<P>

2.	I dismiss the appeal by way of Stated Case by I M Engineering Pty Limited
(matter number 10080/99).
<P>

3.	I hold that the Determination by the Local Court Magistrate was not
erroneous in point of law.
<P>

4.	There is no order of costs in respect of either Stated Case.
<P>
