<p><a name="Coversheettable"></a><a name="Headnote"></a><b>JUDGMENT</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='1' value="1">Before
the court for determination is a notice of motion filed by the defendant on 14
May 2012. Although the notice of motion contains
a number of prayers for relief,
the orders sought in the hearing before me were limited to those set out in
paragraphs (1), (2) and
(3) which were in the following terms: </li></ol><p></p>
<blockquote>
(1)	that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to r 13.4 of <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/ucpr2005305/" class="autolink_findacts">Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules</i> 2005</a> ("the rules");</blockquote><p></p>
<blockquote>
(2)	alternatively to order (1), an order that summary judgment be given in
favour of the defendant pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction
of the
court;</blockquote><p></p>
<blockquote>
(3)	alternatively to orders (1) and (2), an order that the statement of claim be
struck out pursuant to r 14.28 of the rules.</blockquote><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='2' value="2">The
plaintiff opposes the making of the orders sought.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>THE PRINCIPAL PROCEEDINGS</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='3' value="3">The
defendant is the plaintiff's former solicitor. By a statement of claim filed on
14 November 2011, the plaintiff seeks damages
arising out of the defendant's
representation of the plaintiff in proceedings which were brought against him in
this court in 1988.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='4' value="4">The
statement of claim was prepared by the plaintiff without legal assistance. As a
consequence, and without wishing to be unduly
critical of the plaintiff, it is
inelegantly pleaded and contains a number of assertions which would seem to be
irrelevant. However,
for present purposes the nature of the plaintiff's case may
be summarised as follows.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='5' value="5">In
or about 1996, the plaintiff granted a mortgage over a property at Moorebank in
order to obtain finance to undertake a property
development involving the
construction of a number of townhouses. It appears that the plaintiff
subsequently defaulted under the
terms of the mortgage, resulting in the
mortgagee commencing proceedings against him in this court seeking orders for
(inter alia)
possession of the property over which the mortgage was held ("the
possession proceedings"). The defendant acted for the plaintiff
in the
possession proceedings. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='6' value="6">On
18 May 1998 orders were made in the possession proceedings, including an order
that the mortgagee have leave to issue a writ of
possession. In this regard,
paragraph (13) of the statement of claim is pleaded in the following
terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"The defendant acted illegitimately and carelessly in a court appearance when
he misled the parties and the court to believe that
the plaintiff was consensual
(sic) to the court orders made on 18-05-98. The orders were to the detriment of
the plaintiff and favourable
to the mortgagee and to the interests of a third
party who want to buy the development in lot (7)."</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='7' value="7">Paragraph
(14) of the statement of claim pleads that the making of those consent orders
was without instructions and that this "<i>caused the plaintiff to suffer shock
and trauma at the time when the sheriff entered his home / property with the
writ of possession</i>". The statement of claim goes on to plead, at various
stages, that the plaintiff was "<i>badly advised and deceived by the
defendant"</i> and that the defendant's conduct was <i>"illegal and malicious".
</i></li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='8' value="8">The
statement of claim then pleads (at paragraph (17)) that it was not until 8 June
2011 that the plaintiff became aware of the consent
orders which had been made
in 1998 and (at paragraph (19)) that the negligence of the defendant in 1998
caused an impairment of the
plaintiff's health which was said to have been
brought about by the <i>"humiliation and loss of self-respect in seeing (the
plaintiff's) project being completed by someone else in 1999".</i> The
suggestion that the plaintiff was aware, as early as 1999, that the development
was being completed by some person other than
himself does not sit entirely
comfortably with the proposition that he did not become aware of the consent
orders made in the possession
proceedings until June 2011. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='9' value="9">The
relief which is claimed by the plaintiff in the statement of claim is twofold,
namely:</li></ol><p></p>
<blockquote>
(a)	an order that the defendant pay "<i>compensatory damages</i>" for causing
mental and physical injury to the plaintiff; and</blockquote><p></p>
<blockquote>
(b)	an order that the defendant "<i>compensate the plaintiff for suffering the
financial loss</i>" which is pleaded in the statement of claim, such financial
loss allegedly arising from the fact that the plaintiff lost the opportunity
to
complete the development. </blockquote><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='10' value="10">An
amended defence was filed on 24 July 2012. That defence places squarely in issue
the allegation that the defendant acted negligently
in respect of the making of
the orders of 18 May 1998, and pleads that such orders were made on the express
instructions of the plaintiff.
Moreover, the amended defence raises a number of
specific defences to the plaintiff's cause of action, including an assertion
that
it is statute barred having regard to the provisions of the <i>Limitation
Act </i>1999. It is not necessary, for present purposes, to further detail the
other issues which are raised by the amended defence. </li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>THE EVIDENCE ON THE HEARING OF THE MOTION</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='11' value="11">The
defendant read, without objection, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the affidavit of
Melissa Fenton 4 June 2012, along with a further
affidavit of Ms Fenton sworn on
3 September 2012. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='12' value="12">The
plaintiff tendered two documents (which became exhibit 1), being a letter from
the plaintiff to a Mr Porter of 28 November 2011,
along with Mr Porter's reply
of 23 December 2011. In addition, the plaintiff read (without objection) his
affidavit of 29 August
2012 along with his affidavit of 24 September 2012. Each
of those affidavits was lengthy and I have referred further below to those
particular parts to which the court was taken for the purposes of the hearing of
the motion.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>THE RELEVANT FACTS</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='13' value="13">The
affidavit material to which I have referred establishes the following facts
which are relevant to the determination of the motion.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='14' value="14">On
29 September 2006, a sequestration order was made against the plaintiff in the
Federal Court of Australia. Ian Charles Francis
and Jason Lloyd Porter were
appointed trustees of the plaintiff's estate. The plaintiff was discharged from
bankruptcy on 27 October
2009 (annexure "A" to the affidavit of Ms Fenton sworn
4 June 2012) </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='15' value="15">On
28 November 2011 the plaintiff wrote to Mr Porter (part of exhibit 1) in the
following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>Please find enclosed a copy of my statement of claim filed in the Supreme
Court File No. 2011/362962 and please inform me of the following:</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>1. Do you have an interest in the financial loss part of my claim and if
so, what is the amount that you require from any compensation
amount if awarded
in my favour for my financial loss?</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>2. Should you be added as a party to the proceeding?</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>3. What is the procedure in having the financial loss part of my claim
assigned to myself?</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='16' value="16">On
23 December 2011, Mr Porter responded (part of exhibit 1):</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>I refer to your letter dated 28 November 2011. I confirm the
following:-</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>1. I have no interest in the proceedings;</i></p>
<p><i>2. I should not be added as a party to the proceedings; and</i></p>
<p><i>3. Your claim appears to be compensation in relation to a personal injury
claim and thus is not divisible amongst the creditors pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
116(2)(g)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a>. Accordingly, there is no claim vesting in
me to assign to you.</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='17' value="17">On
16 July 2012 the plaintiff again wrote to Mr Porter (Annexure "G" to the
plaintiff's affidavit of 29 August 2012) as follows:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>As you know, I am the plaintiff in the Supreme Court proceedings No.
2011/362962. I confirm that I previously provided to you with
(sic) a copy of my
statement of claim herein and you indicated that you did not consider that the
right to sue had vested in you
in your capacity as my former trustee because of
the personal injury of the proceedings: see you letter dated 13 December
2011.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Notwithstanding your letter, an issue has arisen as to whether I am
entitled to bring the proceedings referred to above. This is in
part due to the
non-personal injury aspects of my claim. Therefore I respectfully request that
you execute the attached deed which
merely seeks to confirm that no chose in
action to sue is vested in you. I enclose a deed executed by me and ask that you
execute
the same and return it to me as soon as possible.</i></p>
<p></p>

Deed which was referred to in the plaintiff's letter (which is annexure "H" to
the same affidavit) recited the fact that Mr Porter
was the plaintiff's former
trustee, that he had perused and considered the statement of claim filed by the
plaintiff, and that he
at no stage claimed any interest in the proceedings. The
deed then purported to confirm:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>(a) the assignment, by Mr Porter to the plaintiff, of <i>"all interests in
the proceedings (if any)"</i>; and</p>
<p>(b) that such assignment was to <i>"take effect as of the discharge of the

<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='19' value="19">The
plaintiff then forwarded an email to Mr Porter on 7 August 2012 (annexure "I" to
the plaintiff's affidavit of 29 August 2012)
which was in the following
terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>Please find attached my letter to you dated 16-07-2012; please inform in

31 August 2012, Mr Porter responded to the plaintiff (part of annexure "A" to
the affidavit of Ms Fenton sworn on 3 September 2012)
in (inter alia) the
following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>"I reaffirm my previous position that I have no interest in these
proceedings. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>You have demanded that I sign the proposed Deed enclosed with your letter.
</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Your letter states that the proposed Deed 'merely seeks to confirm that no
chose in action to sue vested in you'. However, clause
1 of your proposed Deed
states 'Jason Porter hereby assigns all interests in the proceedings (if any) to
Anthony Murdaca'. Clearly
your letter and proposed Deed are contradictory. For
the avoidance of doubt, I do not agree with your proposed Deed, nor will I be
signing it.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>You were discharged from bankruptcy on 27 October 2009, some three years,
ago, and commenced these proceedings in 2011. I advised
you on 23 December 2011
that I had no interest in these proceedings and I made it clear that I did not
assign a vested action to
you (if any exists). My position has not changed.
</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>If you believe that you have a personal injury claim, then that is
entirely a matter for you. There is no benefit to you (sic) bankrupt
estate and
creditors generally".</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='21' value="21">On
the same day, Mr Porter wrote to Ms Fenton (part of Annexure "A" to Ms Fenton's
affidavit sworn on 3 September 2012) in (inter
alia) the following
terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>"In respect of Mr Murdaca's claim that my letter dated 23 December 2011
amounts to an assignment of the chose in action back to him.
I deny this claim
and do not interpret it as an assignment. If any action has vested, it has not
been assigned to Mr Murdaca.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>I confirm that I have received a letter and proposed Deed from Mr Murdaca
dated 16 July 2011 demanding that I execute same. I advise
that I have not
executed the Deed, nor do I intend to do so".</i></p>

<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='22' value="22">On
20 July 2012 Dr Yolanda Lucire, a Forensic Psychiatrist, examined the plaintiff
for the purposes of assessing the plaintiff's mental
state between 1997 and
2012. Dr Lucire subsequently provided a report dated 17 August 2012 (annexure
"A" to the plaintiff's affidavit
of 29 August 2012). Counsel for the plaintiff
took me, in particular, to that part of the report which appeared under the
heading
<i>"Summary of opinion"</i> in which Dr Lucire reported that in her
opinion, the plaintiff: </li></ol><p></p>
<p>(a) was, in the 12 month period leading up to the commencement of the
possession proceedings on 28 January 1988, suffering from an
Adjustment Disorder
with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, which may have been the direct result of
a car accident in which he had
been involved;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) was, at the date of the making of the sequestration order, anxious and
agitated, and sought treatment from a Dr Noonan;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(c) had been consistently receiving psychiatric attention for depression and
anxiety from a number of psychiatrists;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(d) took medication which did not assist him up until 2000, at which time he
ceased that medication and changed medical practitioners;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(e) remained, at the time of examination in July 2012, agitated, <i>"a
bit"</i> cognitively impaired, and suffering from difficulties with memory and
concentration secondary to anxiety; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(f) had experienced misfortune in his life which had resulted in chronic
unhappiness and depression.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='23' value="23">Although
not formally part of the affidavit evidence, reference was also made by counsel
for the defendant (in the context more fully
set out below) to the fact that
between 2005 and 2008 the plaintiff pursued proceedings against various entities
in this court as
well as the Local Court, the Federal Magistrates Court (as it
was then known), the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court.
In this
context, reference was made to decisions in <i>Murdaca v Accounts Control

<p><b>THE ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION ON THE MOTION</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='24' value="24">The
parties agreed that three issues arose for determination on the notice of
motion. They are as follows:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>(a) did the plaintiff's right to bring proceedings against the defendant vest
in his trustee as at the date of his bankruptcy? ("the
first issue"); </p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) if so, did that right "re-vest" in the plaintiff at the time of his
discharge from bankruptcy by virtue of an assignment of it
from the plaintiff's
trustee? ("the second issue"); and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(c) to the extent that the plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury, is
that claim one which is unrelated to his property or estate,
and therefore
maintainable? ("the third issue").</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO THE RELIEF SOUGHT</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='25' value="25">The
primary relief sought by the defendant in paragraph (1) of the notice of motion
is that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant
to r. 13.4 of the rules. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s13.4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 13.4</a>
is in the following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b><i>13.4 Frivolous and vexatious proceedings </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(1) If in any proceedings it appears to the court that in relation to the
proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief
in the proceedings:
</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(a) the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(b) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, or</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(c) the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the court,</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>the court may order that the proceedings be dismissed generally or in
relation to that claim.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(2) The court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an
order under sub rule (1).</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='26' value="26">Counsel
for the defendant specifically relied on the provisions of r. 13.4(1)(c). He
submitted that the proceedings brought by the
plaintiff were an abuse of the
process of the court because:</li></ol><p></p>
<blockquote>
(a)	his right to sue the defendant was property which had vested in his trustee
upon being made bankrupt and which had not "re-vested"
in him;
and</blockquote><p></p>
<blockquote>
(b)	to the extent that his action was one for personal injury, it was one which
was directly related to his property or estate, and
therefore not maintainable.
</blockquote><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='27' value="27">Every
court has, as a necessary incident of its jurisdiction, the power to control its
own proceedings and procedure, although what
may amount to an abuse of process
is insusceptible of a formulation comprising closed categories of circumstances
(<i>Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2006/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282006%29%20227%20ALR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2006)

are untenable for some reason, are capable of constituting an abuse of
process
(<i>Charles Forte Investments Ltd v Amanda </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20Ch%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] Ch 240).</a></li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='28' value="28">In
the course of argument counsel for the defendant sought to distinguish the
present case from those in which relief might be sought
pursuant to r.
13.4(1)(b) on the basis that no reasonable cause of action was disclosed.
Counsel went to some lengths to point out
that in the present case, the order
dismissing the proceedings was not sought on the basis that there was some
underlying defect
in the merits of the plaintiff's action. Rather, he stressed
that the order was sought on the basis that the proceedings constituted
an abuse
of process because there was a fatal and fundamental defect in the plaintiff's
position. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='29' value="29">In
my view, and in either case, the general principle that a plaintiff is prima
facie entitled to have his case come to trial, and
that an application to
deprive him of that right will succeed only in the clearest of cases, remains
applicable. I did not understand
counsel for the plaintiff to take issue with
the proposition that, irrespective of the particular basis upon which the court
is asked
to exercise its power pursuant to r 13.4, the suggested fatal defects
in the plaintiff's case must be very clear before the court
will intervene and
dismiss the proceedings (as to which see <i>General Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways New South Wales</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a>
at 129).</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='30' value="30">In
the alternative, relief was sought pursuant to r. 14.28 which is in the
following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b><i>14.28 Circumstances in which court may strike out pleadings
</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(1) The court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the whole or
any part of a pleading be struck out if the pleading: </i></p>
<p></p>
<p>(a)discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the pleading, or</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings, or</p>
<p>(c) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(2) The court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an
order under sub rule (1).</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='31' value="31">In
contrast to r. 13.4, the court's power under r 14.28 is concerned with those
cases where there is a defect in the pleadings. It
is not directed to cases
where the court comes to the conclusion that the plaintiff's case, as opposed to
his pleading, is hopeless.
When a pleading is defective, in that the pleading
discloses no cause of action or the pleading tends to cause prejudice,
embarrassment
or delay, or the pleading is otherwise an abuse of process, the
court has power under r 14.28 to strike out the whole, or part, of
the
pleading.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='32' value="32">For
the purposes of r 14.28 a pleading will be regarded as embarrassing if it is
unintelligible, ambiguous or so imprecise in its
identification of material
factual allegations as to deprive the opposing party of proper notice of the
real substance of the claim
or the defence (see <i>Gunns v Marr</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/2005/251.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2005] VSC
251</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/2005/251.html#para15" class="autolink_findcases">[15]</a>). A pleading may also be embarrassing if it contains inconsistent,
confusing or irrelevant allegations (see <i>Shelton v National Roads and
Motorists Association Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2004/1393.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2004] FCA 1393</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282004%29%2051%20ACSR%20278" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2004) 51 ACSR 278</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2004/1393.html#para18" class="autolink_findcases">[18]</a>).</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>THE FIRST ISSUE </b></p>
<p><b>The submissions of the parties</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='33' value="33">Counsel
for the defendant firstly pointed to the relevant sequence of events. He relied,
in particular, upon the following:</li></ol><p></p>
<blockquote>
(a)	the alleged acts and omissions which were said to give rise to the
plaintiff's cause of action had occurred in the first half
of 1998;<br>
(b)	the plaintiff's proceedings had been commenced on 14 November 2011, more
than 13 years later;<br>
(c)	on 29 September 2006, that is within that intervening 13 year period, a
sequestration order was made against the plaintiff;<br>
(d)	on 27 October 2009, which was again within that intervening period, the
plaintiff was discharged from bankruptcy.</blockquote><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='34' value="34">Counsel
for the defendant further submitted that by virtue of the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 58</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act </i>1966</a> ("the Act"), the plaintiff's property passed to,
and vested in, his trustees on the making of the sequestration order, and
thereupon
became divisible amongst his creditors. He submitted that the effect
of s. 58 of the Act was to create a "vesting scheme", by the
operation of which
the plaintiff's right to bring proceedings against the defendant vested in his
trustees upon the making of the
sequestration order.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='35' value="35">The
principal submission advanced on behalf of the plaintiff was that
notwithstanding s. 58 of the Act, and on a proper construction
of s. 116(1)(b),
no property comprised of the right to bring proceedings against the defendant
had ever vested in the plaintiff's
trustee at all. This, it was submitted, was
because the plaintiff was under a mental disability at the relevant time (as
outlined
by Dr Lucire in the report to which I previously referred) and that, as
a consequence, the plaintiff lacked the necessary capacity
contemplated by s.
116(1)(b) to exercise any power in respect of such property. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='36' value="36">In
response to the plaintiff's principal submission, counsel for the defendant
submitted that the construction of s. 116 advanced
by the plaintiff was not
correct. He submitted that the use of the word "capacity" in s. 116(1)(b) should
be construed as meaning
"authority", rather than being read as a reference to a
person's mental capacity. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='37' value="37">Counsel
for the defendant also submitted that the construction advanced by the plaintiff
was generally at odds with the nature of
the scheme introduced by the Act which,
he said, was designed to vest all of a bankrupt's property in his trustee
notwithstanding
that such a step might deprive the bankrupt of certain civil
rights (as to which see the observations of Kirby P in <i>Daemar v Industrial
Commission of NSW </i>(1988) 12 NSWLR 85 esp. at 50). </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='38' value="38">In
the alternative, counsel for the defendant submitted that even if the
construction of s. 116(1)(b) of the Act which was advanced
on behalf of the
plaintiff were accepted as being correct, the evidence established that the
plaintiff was not, at the relevant time,
under any disability in any event. In
this respect, Counsel relied upon the fact that between 2005 and 2008, the
plaintiff had, in
his own right, commenced various proceedings in this court,
the Federal Magistrate's Court, and the Federal Court, and that in at
least some
of those proceedings the plaintiff had appeared in person (see [23] above).
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='39' value="39">Counsel
drew particular attention to a judgment of Young CJ in Eq in <i>Murdaca v RAMS

plaintiff as a <i>"self represented litigant appearing at the hearing ..... who
appeared for himself and did so competently and courteously". </i>Counsel
submitted that in light of his Honour's description, and having regard to the
fundamental fact that the plaintiff had commenced
and conducted proceedings in
his own right and without the appointment of a tutor, the evidence supported a
conclusion that he was
not, at the relevant time, under any relevant
incapacity.</li></ol><p></p>

<p><i>(3) Where a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the
Commonwealth requires the transmission of property to be registered,
and enables
the trustee to be registered as the owner of any such property that is part of
the property of the bankrupt, that property,

equity in the trustee by virtue of this section, does not vest in the trustee at
law until the requirements
of that law have been complied with. </i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='45' value="45">Pivotal
to the submission advanced by counsel for the plaintiff were the provisions of
s. 116(1)(b) of the Act. Shortly put, counsel
submitted that no property
comprised of the plaintiff's right to bring proceedings against the defendant
ever vested in the trustee
at any time, and was therefore not property divisible
amongst the plaintiff's creditors. This, it was submitted, was because he lacked
the mental capacity to exercise power over his property. </li></ol><p></p>

<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='47' value="47">As
I have previously noted, the parties agreed that the plaintiff's right to bring
proceedings against the defendant formed part of
the plaintiff's "property"
having regard to the definition of that term contained in s. 5 of the Act. By
virtue of the operation
s. 58 of the Act, along with the operation of s. 132,
that property vested in the plaintiff's trustee upon the making of the
sequestration
order against him. Section 58 lays down a general rule. It
provides for a mechanism whereby, upon the making of a sequestration order,
the
bankrupt's property vests in his or her trustee. In the present case, that
mechanism resulted in the plaintiff's right to bring
proceedings against the
defendant being vested in his two appointed trustees upon the making of the
sequestration order. The provisions
of s. 116 generally, and the provisions of
s. 116(1)(b) in particular, are directed to a different issue, namely the
divisibility
of such property as was vested in the bankrupt as at the date of
the bankruptcy. Even if it is assumed that s. 116(1)(b) has some
bearing upon
the present issue, the word "capacity" as it is used in that section refers, in
my view, to capacity in the sense of
"authority" or "right" to exercise a
particular power over property, rather than mental capacity as was submitted on
behalf of the
plaintiff. I am fortified in that view by the decision in
<i>Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL </i>[1996] HCA 19; (1996) 185 CLR 124. In
that case, the High Court, in considering the question of whether a right to
appeal in an action
brought to enforce a liability of the bankrupt was
"property" within the meaning of s. 5 of the Act, Brennan CJ, Gaudron J and
McHugh
J observed (at 133)</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"A chose in action may be the property of the person entitled to enforce it
but a liability to satisfy a judgement enforcing a chose
in action is not
property of the person against whom the judgment is entered. A liability is not
property of the person liable. Nor
is a right to appeal against a money judgment
property of the judgment debtor. Nor does such right to appeal answer the
description
of property divisible amongst creditors defined by s. 116(1)(b),
namely, 'the capacity to exercise, and to take proceedings for exercising
all
such powers in, over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by
the bankrupt for his own benefit'. The powers
referred to are powers 'which are
familiar to all conveyancers and are powers properly so called', as Farwell J
pointed out in <i>Re Rose; Trustee of the Property of ET Rose v Rose</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%202%20Ch%20348" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904)

authorities to dispose of property or interests in property for the benefit of
the donee
of the power or of some other person</u></i>. In this case, there is
now property 'over or in respect of' which the bankrupt is or would have been
capable of exercising a power.
As a matter of ordinary language, a judgment
debtor's right to appeal against the judgment is not property" (emphasis
added)</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='48' value="48">For
these reasons, I find that the plaintiff's right to bring proceedings against
the defendant was property which vested in his trustees
at the time of the
making of the sequestration order against him. </li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>THE SECOND ISSUE</b></p>
<p><b>The submissions of the parties</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='49' value="49">Counsel
for the plaintiff submitted that even if a conclusion was reached that the
plaintiff's right to bring proceedings against
the defendant vested in his
trustee upon the making of the sequestration order, such right "re-vested" in
the plaintiff upon his
discharge from bankruptcy by virtue of it having been
assigned back to him by his trustee. In this regard, counsel relied upon
correspondence
from one of the trustees, Mr Porter, to the plaintiff, and in
particular the letter of 23 December 2011 from Mr Porter to the plaintiff
(the
contents of which are set out in full at [16] above). He submitted that such
correspondence constituted an assignment by the
trustee, back to the plaintiff,
of the right to bring proceedings against the defendant. Whilst conceding that
the evidence did not
support a conclusion that there had been an assignment at
law, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the evidence supported a
conclusion that there had been an assignment in equity.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='50' value="50">Counsel
for the defendant submitted that as a matter of fundamental principle, the
discharge of a bankrupt does not, of itself, have
the effect of re-vesting, in
the bankrupt, the property which was vested in the trustee upon the making of
the sequestration order.
He further submitted that properly construed, the
correspondence from Mr Porter did not constitute an assignment of the right to
bring proceedings against the defendant back to the plaintiff and that, in
particular, the evidence did not support the conclusion
that there had been an
assignment in equity.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>Consideration and determination of the second issue</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='51' value="51">Section
152 of the Act is in the following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b><i>Discharged bankrupt to give assistance </i></b></p>
<p><i>A discharged bankrupt must, even though discharged, give such assistance
as the trustee reasonably requires in the realization and
distribution of such
of his or her property as is vested in the trustee. </i></p>
<p><i>Penalty: Imprisonment for 6 months. </i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='52' value="52">Section
153(1) of the Act is in the following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b><i>Effect of discharge </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>(1) Subject to this section, where a bankrupt is discharged from a
bankruptcy, the discharge operates to release him or her from all
debts
(including secured debts) provable in the bankruptcy, whether or not, in the
case of a secured debt, the secured creditor has
surrendered his or her security
for the benefit of creditors generally. </i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='53' value="53">The
operation and effect of these provisions were considered by Needham J in
<i>Pegler v Dale</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%201%20NSWLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 1 NSWLR 265</a> at 267:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"The only way that I can see the property of the bankrupt is vested in the
trustee is by virtue of the sequestration order. If property
so vested in the
trustee continues to be vested in the trustee after discharge, as s. 152(1)
indicates, then the operation of s.
153 in discharging the bankrupt from debts
cannot have the effect of re-vesting, in the bankrupt, the property which was,
under the
sequestration order, vested in the trustee."</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='54' value="54">The
proposition that the property of a bankrupt does not re-vest in the bankrupt
upon discharge from bankruptcy has been subsequently
confirmed on a number of
occasions. In <i>Piwinski v Corporate Trustees of the Diocese of Armidale</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%201%20NSWLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 1 NSWLR 265</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%206%20ALR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 6 ALR 62)</a>, a builder had sued a client for damages
for breach of a building contract and subsequent to the commencement of the
proceedings,
the builder's estate was sequestrated. A deed of settlement was
subsequently executed between the builder and the official receiver,
whereby the
builder's claim was withdrawn. Following his discharge from bankruptcy, the
builder again commenced proceedings on the
same cause of action. In ordering
that the proceedings be dismissed, Waddell J said (at 279):</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"The next question is whether such property remains vested in the Official
Receiver notwithstanding the subsequent discharge of the
plaintiff from
bankruptcy. I think that, clearly, it does.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By statute the property was vested in the official receiver under the 1924
Act. Pursuant to the transitional provisions under the
1966 Act it became vested
in the official receiver under that Act. There is nothing 1966 Act which divests
the Official Receiver
of that cause of action, or the property to which it
relates. In fact, one its provisions, s, 152(1), requires the bankrupt to assist
the Official Receiver, even though discharged, in recovery of the property
vested in him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just looking at the statute then, it is clear, I think, that the property to
which the proceeding relates remains vested in the Official
Receiver under the
1966 Act. In reaching this conclusion I would respectfully adopt the reasoning
which lead Needham J to reach the
same conclusion in <i>Pegler v Dale</i>. It
follows that the plaintiff is not competent to bring this proceeding to recover
property and damages, the right to which remain
vested in the Official
Receiver."</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='55' value="55">Similarly,
in <i>Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales and Anor [No 2]
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20NSWLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 22 NSWLR 178</a>, Kirby P said at p. 185 (in reference to the judgment of
Needham J in <i>Pegler v Dale</i>):</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"(Section 152 of the Act), as Needham J pointed out, assumes that property
vested in a trustee at the time of sequestration remains
vested in that trustee,
even after the discharge of the bankrupt. There is nothing in the section that
specifically re-vests in the
discharge bankrupt. The property which was, by the
sequestration order, vested in the trustee. That property included choses in
action.
Not only is Needham J's construction attentive of the language of s.
152. It is appropriate to the scheme of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i>. Under that
Act, it is the function of the trustee to gather in for the benefit of the
creditors of the property of the bankrupt
at the time of sequestration. Save for
the exceptions provided by the Act, such property is to be then available for
distribution
to the creditors. The property includes choses in action. It thus
includes the 'actions' which a bankrupt may have commenced at the
time of the
sequestration order. The act exempts certain personal actions. But, for the
reasons which were given in the original
stay proceedings, the claimants action
against the Industrial Commission and Mr Sheath is not in that class".</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='56' value="56">In
my view, in light of these authorities, the statement of principle relied upon
by counsel for the defendant was clearly correct.
Property vested in a trustee
at the time of the making of a sequestration order does not re-vest in the
bankrupt upon discharge from
bankruptcy. Accepting this to be the case, the
question is whether or not the property in the present case, is whether the
plaintiff's
right to bring proceedings against the defendant was assigned back
to him by the trustee by virtue of the correspondence which passed
between
them.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='57' value="57">In
the correspondence of 23 December 2011, the trustee informed the plaintiff that
he had no interest in the proceedings and ought
not be added as a party. He also
told the plaintiff, in specific terms, that there was <i>"no claim vesting (in
him) to assign to (the plaintiff)". </i>The entirety of that correspondence runs
directly contrary to the proposition that there was an assignment to the
plaintiff. Subsequent
events, and in particular the trustee's refusal to execute
the Deed sent to him on 16 July 2012 (set out at [16] and [17] above)
only serve
to confirm that position.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='58' value="58">However,
and more specifically, the correspondence which passed between the plaintiff and
Mr Porter is not, in my view, sufficient
to establish the requirements necessary
for an equitable assignment. In <i>Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation
</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20109%20CLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 109 CLR 9</a> Windeyer J observed (at
28):</li></ol><p></p>
<p>" .... the general rule of equity is that an effective assignment occurs only
if the donor does all that, according to the nature
of the property, he must do
to transfer the property to the donee. But the weight of authority is, I think
in favour of the view
that in equity there is a valid give of property
transferable at law if the donor, intending to make, then and there, a complete
disposition and transfer to the donee, does all that on his part is necessary to
give effect to his intention and arms the done with
the means of completing the
gift according to the requirements of the law ..." </p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='59' value="59">In
my view, the terms of the correspondence from Mr Porter to the plaintiff are
generally at odds with the proposition that Mr Porter
had the intention to which
Windeyer J referred. The correspondence is similarly at odds with the
proposition that Mr Porter did everything
required in order to put such
intention into effect. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='60' value="60">For
these reasons, I conclude that there was no assignment of any property to the
plaintiff upon his discharge from bankruptcy. </li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>THE THIRD ISSUE</b></p>
<p><b>The submissions of the parties</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='61' value="61">It
is common ground between the parties that at least part of the plaintiff's claim
against the defendant is a claim for damages for
personal injury or wrong done
to him. Having regard to the provisions of s. 60(4) of the Act, it is prima
facie open to a bankrupt
to continue such an action which had been commenced by
him before he or she became bankrupt. In the present case of course, the
proceedings
were commenced well after the plaintiff became bankrupt and, indeed,
some considerable time after his discharge. Counsel for the
plaintiff submitted
that in these circumstances, even I was to find against the plaintiff in
relation to the first and second issues,
the plaintiff should nevertheless be
permitted to proceed with that part of his claim in which he seeks damages for
personal injury.
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='62' value="62">Counsel
for the defendant submitted (and I understood counsel for the plaintiff to
accept) that in terms of actions by a bankrupt
for damages for personal injury,
a distinction is drawn between independent causes of action for personal injury
on the one hand,
and actions for personal injury which are consequent upon, or
related to, a bankrupt's property rights on the other. In these circumstances,
counsel submitted that even though <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 116(2)(g)(i)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a>
</i>preserves the right of a bankrupt to recover damages for personal injury, it
does not extend to a personal injury claim which is directly
related to the
bankrupt's property or estate. He submitted that the plaintiff's personal injury
claim fell into such a category.
Counsel for the plaintiff took issue with this
latter proposition, and contended that on a proper analysis, the plaintiff's
claim
for damages for personal injury was one which stood apart from, and
independently of, any property right.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>Consideration and determination of the third issue</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='63' value="63">I
have already noted that the provisions of s. 116 of the Act which deal with the
issue of property of a bankrupt which is divisible
amongst that bankrupt's
creditors. Section 116(2) specifically excludes certain property from the
operation of s. 116(1), such that
it is not divisible amongst a bankrupt's
creditors. One such exclusion is that property contained in s.
116(2)(g)(i):</li></ol><p></p>
<p><i>(g) any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation: </i></p>

relevant to a consideration of this issue are the provisions of s. 60(4) of the
Act which are in the following terms:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, a bankrupt may
continue, in his or her own name, an action commenced by him
or her before he or

<p>"19. The negligence of the defendant in 1998 caused impairment of the
plaintiff's mental condition and caused further injury in that
the plaintiff had
to suffer humiliation and loss of self-respect in seeing his project being
completed by someone else in 1999 (the
plaintiff lived on the site in town -
house number 1). Consequentially (sic) the plaintiff needed several years of
regular psychiatric
treatment. The injuries to his mental and physical health
contributed towards his bankruptcy in September of 2006 and the sale (by
the
trustee in bankruptcy) of all of his assets in 2009.</p>
<p></p>
<p>20. The building of 6 - townhouses on Lot (7) - stage (2) - was to be the
profitable stage of the plaintiff's project which he started
in 1990; he was
involved in the design, the development of the project and the building of 6
town - house of stage (1) in an incremental
process of two houses at a time;
this activity was a therapeutic benefit to him. The professional negligence of
the defendant caused
the loss of stage (2) of the plaintiff's project which
altered (and augmented with major depression) his mental condition causing
his
(sic) several years of a withdrawn and sedentary existence resulting in damage
to his physical health. The plaintiff was diagnosed
in 1988 with a
schizoaffective disorder by his treating psychiatrist. Between 1988 and 1998 his
illness was severe and disabling
in irregular periods. Post the court
proceedings of 1998 to the present time the disabling aspects of his injuries -
illness have
been constant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>21. The plaintiff claims compensatory damages for personal injury and relies

appropriate".</p>

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='72' value="72">In
light of the pleadings, the claim for damages brought by the plaintiff is one
which is consequential upon the alleged negligence
of the defendant in the
possession proceedings. The possession proceedings arose from the granting of a
mortgage by the plaintiff
to secure finance for a property development. In those
circumstances, the plaintiff's claim for damages for personal injury could
not,
in my view, be categorised as a claim "without reference to his rights of
property" (see <i>Mannigel </i>(supra) per Handley JA at 2). That being the
case, the action is not maintainable.</li></ol><p></p>

the claim to a point" submitted that the determination
of this question involved
something more than mere reference to the manner in which the statement of claim
had been pleaded. He submitted
that the personal injury complained of by the
plaintiff could "potentially be tied down to a number of factual alternatives".
By
way of example, counsel referred me to paragraph (5) of the statement of
claim which pleads (inter alia) that the plaintiff is the
defendant's uncle. He
submitted that it was part of the plaintiff's case that the relevant breaches of
