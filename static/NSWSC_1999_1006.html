<u>30021/1999</u>	<u>OSTIMA PTY LTD &amp; ANOR v YOUSEFF SARKIS &amp;
ANOR</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The first plaintiff is a developer.  The second plaintiff is a
director of the first plaintiff.  The first plaintiff was involved
in a
development of a property known 1 Waitara Parade, Hurstville Grove (the
property).
<P>

2  	In about mid August 1998, a contract was made with the first
defendant to perform cement rendering work.  Some work was done
by the first
defendant.  There was dispute between the parties.  There was a purported
termination of the contract.
<P>

3  	The first defendant brought a claim in the Consumer Claims
Tribunal (the second defendant in these proceedings).  Both plaintiffs
became
respondents (there was a question as to whether the contract had been made with
the second plaintiff).  The claim was for
a specific sum of money which fell
within the jurisdictional limit of the tribunal.  The claim came before a
referee (Mr Baker).
 Following a hearing the referee determined that the first
defendant was entitled to the sum of $3,200 (which was a part of the sum
claimed by him) on the basis of quantum meruit.  Written reasons for the
decision have been provided.
<P>

4  	The plaintiffs now bring proceedings in this Court.  The process
relied on is an Amended Summons filed on 9 April 1999.  The
plaintiffs seek to
have the determination of the tribunal set aside.  Although the Amended Summons
raises matters of jurisdiction,
the only basis upon which relief is sought is
alleged denial of natural justice.
<P>

5  	The plaintiffs have been represented by counsel.  The first
defendant has been represented by counsel.  The second defendant
has filed a
submitting appearance.
<P>

6  	The second plaintiff has sworn two affidavits.  He has been
cross-examined.  The first defendant has sworn an affidavit.  He
was not
cross-examined.  The parties have tendered documentation.
<P>

7  	I should first mention the position that existed prior to the
hearing before the referee.  On behalf of the plaintiffs, it was
being
contended that there was a Cross-claim had against the first defendant.  By
letter dated 9 December 1998, the tribunal was
notified that this Cross-claim
did not fall within the jurisdiction of the tribunal and had to be heard
elsewhere.  An adjournment
was sought for a period of three months to allow the
commencement of proceedings in a higher court.
<P>

8  	The claim first came before the tribunal on 16 December 1998.  It
appears that a question of jurisdiction was raised by the
second plaintiff on
that day.  The tribunal was told that there was a claim founded on alleged
breach of contract which they wanted
to bring in another place.  The parties
were told that the jurisdiction argument could not be determined until evidence
had been
heard in relation to the termination of the contract (including
evidence in relation to defective work).  Thereafter, a hearing commenced
and
the proceedings became part heard.  It appears that the parties proceeded on
the basis of the hearing of the first defendant's
disputed claim.  It seems
that the plaintiffs did not make any application for adjournment at the hearing
itself.
<P>

9  	The proceedings came before the tribunal again on 21 January
1999.  The contested hearing continued on that day.  Again the
proceedings were
part heard.
<P>

10  	The proceedings came before the tribunal again on 25 February
1999.  The contested hearing continued and concluded on that
day.
<P>

11  	The court has before it tribunal records (Exhibit 1).  Although
there is dispute as to what took place during the hearing,
it seems to be
common ground that the total hearing time was in the order of five hours.
<P>

12  	The plaintiffs raise three areas in which it is said there was a
denial of natural justice.  Firstly, it was said that the
plaintiffs were not
given a full opportunity to present their case.  Secondly, it was said that the
tribunal did not discharge its
obligation to identify the issues which were to
be the subject of the determination.  Thirdly, it was said that the Cross-claim
of
the plaintiffs may now be in some jeopardy (in support of this contention
reference was made to <u>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589).</a>
<P>

13  	The onus rests with the plaintiffs to make out their claim for
relief.  I am not satisfied that this onus has been discharged.
 I am not
satisfied that there is substance to any of the three matters argued.
<P>

14  	The parties appeared in person before the tribunal.  The second
plaintiff is a man of considerable commercial experience. 
His affidavit
evidence has been challenged in cross-examination.  He has given evidence which
is not accurate.  In a number of respects,
his evidence was not consistent with
what appears in the material produced by the tribunal.  It was at odds with
unchallenged affidavit
evidence given by the second defendant.  Where there is
conflict between his evidence and other material, I do not accept his
evidence.
<P>

15  	The plaintiffs' Cross-claim was not litigated in the hearing
before the tribunal (it is referred to in the records as a "proposed
claim").
But there was in fact a contested hearing of the first defendant's claim.  I am
not satisfied that the plaintiffs were in
any doubt as to what was going on.
It seems to me that they were fully appraised of the fact that the tribunal was
engaged in a process
of adjudicating on the first defendant's claim in the
light of the defences advanced and litigated by them.
<P>

16  	The reasons significantly conclude with a reference to inter
alia three matters.  There is a finding that the complainant was
entitled to be
paid on the basis of quantum meruit (the quantification had been earlier
determined).  It was said that it followed
that there was jurisdiction to hear
the matters in dispute.  There was a statement that "Because of the way the
matter was heard
there are no further matters to be determined".
<P>

17  	It has been said that the plaintiffs inter alia wanted to call
more witnesses, ask more questions and put further arguments.
 I have had
regard to these contentious complaints in the context of other evidence and the
legislation.
<P>

18  	I am not satisfied that the tribunal did not give the plaintiffs
a reasonable opportunity, in the circumstances of this case,
to present their
Defence to the first defendant's claim.  On two of the three hearing days, the
plaintiffs' expert Mr Dessoix was
present.  He had prepared a report (dealing
with the quality of the work) which was placed before the tribunal.  The
plaintiffs presented
a video which was shown together with commentary from Mr
Dessoix.  The second plaintiff cross-examined both the first defendant and
Mr
Worthington (the first defendant's expert).  The plaintiffs placed other
documentation before the court (including statutory declarations
and letters).
The tribunal records note the various matters argued by the plaintiffs by way
of Defence to the claim.  The records
are consistent with a state of affairs
where they had a reasonable opportunity to present the various aspects of the
Defence and
in substance did so.  The material records that the plaintiffs
propounded a case to the effect that the first defendant should not
recover
anything for the work done.
<P>

19  	It must be borne in mind that the legislation provides an
informal process for inexpensive and expeditious disposition of disputes
concerning relatively small claims (under $25,000). It was not intended to
provide a forum of perfection.
<P>

20  	The formulation of the third area of complaint was somewhat
vague.  The Cross-claim itself has not been reduced to any precise
form.  To
date, it appears that it has not been pursued (it remains a proposed claim) in
any forum.  The matter of its prosecution
has been in the hands of the
plaintiffs.  The matter of the application of what arises from what was said in
the <u>Anshun</u> case was not the subject of much argument.  In the light of
what has been put on behalf of the plaintiffs, I am not satisfied that
there is
any impediment to the plaintiffs pursuing this claim should they wish to do so
and I am not satisfied that this area of
complaint gives rise to any denial of
natural justice.
<P>

21  	In my view the plaintiffs' case fails.  The Summons is
dismissed.  The plaintiffs are to pay the costs of the proceedings.
 The
exhibits may be returned.
<P>
