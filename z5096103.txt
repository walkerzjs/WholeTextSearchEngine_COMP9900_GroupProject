Week 2
Group formed. I wrote 3 epic components of the proposal as well as part of the background. I invited Stanley to the bitbucket and trello group. I uploaded one simple flask app to the bitbucket to help others start development. 

Week 3
We discussed the tasks about finalising the proposal and I wrote an brief comparison about different algorithms on document vectorisation and matching. 

Week 4
I implemented some test function for similarity matching and calculation.Currently it will only compare the different vectors. But later need to do more to take the inputs and then give proper outputs.

Week 5
Implemented some test functions including text extraction, vectoring, similarity matching and computation to test whole case matching as the back end and the result is satisfiable. 

Integrated the front end and back end functions so that the app now can be directly used.

Some changes include:
Interface:
1. Changed the paging button link to <a> with bootstrap button class.
2. Changed the return of the upload route to be redirected to search results.
3. moved the previous extracting title code to a seperate function to be reused conveniently.
4. Created a new html page for displaying search results. The framework reused the html page for displaying all documents.
5. Integrated the search ability for uploaded document and directly inputed text.

Text vectorising:
1. For vectorising part, partly referred to Hoessein’s work to add the ngram_range.

Utility:
1. Referred to Hendri’s work about using utilities object to contain load and write files functions.
