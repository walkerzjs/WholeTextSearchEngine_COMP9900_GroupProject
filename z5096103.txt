Week 2
Group formed. I wrote 3 epic components of the proposal as well as part of the background. I invited Stanley to the bitbucket and trello group. I uploaded one simple flask app to the bitbucket to help others start development. 

Week 3
We discussed the tasks about finalising the proposal and I wrote an brief comparison about different algorithms on document vectorisation and matching.
