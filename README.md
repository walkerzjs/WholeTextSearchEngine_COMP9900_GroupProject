1. Add your ssh key so that you do not have to enter your password everytime you clone, push, or pull. Bottom left corner, select Bitbucket settings, under SECURITY, select SSH keys and Add key.
2. Clone the repository by doing: git clone git@bitbucket.org:csitproject/searchengine.git
3. Create your own branch (I used my zID as my branch name) to update your work diary. Try to not push into master branch.

Important:
1. If master branch is updated, do:
	- git checkout <your_branch>
	- git pull origin master
2. To create a pull request, do:
	- git checkout <your_branch>
	- git branch <new_temporary_branch_name>
	- git checkout <new_temporary_branch_name> (doing this will create an identical branch to your_branch)
	- git push origin <new_temporary_branch_name> (this will make the new branch appear online on Bitbucket)
	- include only necessary files that you want to merge to master. remove unnecessary files using rm (e.g. rm file.txt).
	- git add .
	- git commit -m "files to merge"
	- git push origin <new_temporary_branch_name>
	- create a pull request from Bitbucket using new_temporary_branch_name to master branch. (make sure to check the diff to see that the files you want to merge are all included in that new_temporary_branch_name branch)

* Write access to master branch is only scrum master for editing README.md and add some files
* To merge to master branch, 2 approvals is required. Will increase to 3 or 4 if necessary.

Setting up and running the system:
1. Firstly, run virtual environment and install all supporting external libraries in requirements.txt (pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
2. Secondly, add all case data to the /static/NSW folder. It will not be included in the repository because of the large file size. Next, run init.py.
3. Run searchEngine.py and using browser, go to: localhost:1345
