Intro video to Bitbucket: https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo

1. Add your ssh key so that you do not have to enter your password everytime you clone, push, or pull. Bottom left corner, select Bitbucket settings, under SECURITY, select SSH keys and Add key.
2. Clone the repository by doing: git clone git@bitbucket.org:csitproject/searchengine.git
3. Create your own branch (I used my zID as my branch name) to update your work diary. Try to not push into master unless for required templates and utilities.
4. Try to run searchEngine.py (I ran: "python3 searchEngine.py" in terminal. Need to get some homebrew, python3, and flask in a new OSX laptop).
5. Think of some Epic Stories for this project.
6. Will discuss how to split work for proposal soon.
